["What do dance scenes add to a movie? Unspeakable bliss, for starters. Dancing starts when dialogue fails. When lovers need to move beyond conversation, when conflicts boil past negotiation, when joy can\u2019t be expressed in any other way than by leaping into the air on a trumpeter\u2019s high note.\n\nWith the rise of movie musicals in the early part of the 20th century, dancing moved easily from stage to screen, becoming bigger, more potent, ever more spectacular \u2014 and a lasting love affair with the moviegoing public was born. It\u2019s still going on: Witness the mainstream success of \u201cLa La Land,\u201d a film in the golden age mold.\n\nTaking stock of film\u2019s dance treasury to pick the paragons was an irresistible challenge. In making my choices for the best dance scenes, I looked at several factors: mastery of technique, imaginative choreography, quality of the music \u2014 this is very important \u2014 and design and storytelling. I value authentic expression more than dance doubles and tricky editing. But, in the final analysis, transcendence won out. Does the dancing carry me away, give me chills, distill some truth about the human experience? Whether it\u2019s a masterpiece of steps and skill, or an intentionally funny, hot mess, or a dreamscape that\u2019s intriguingly weird \u2014 dancing that moves you is great dancing.", "Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 Montrezl Harrell, center, looks to shoot under pressure by Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 Tony Snell, left, and John Henson during the first half of an NBA basketball game Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Los Angeles.

They took a safety that appeared intentional, giving Ohio State a 9-6 lead, but that did little to help flip the field position. The ensuing free kick went out of bounds, giving the Buckeyes the ball at the 50, and then Chrisman pinned Michigan State back again.\n\nOhio State capitalized on that punt when a shotgun snap by Michigan State hit the man in motion.

Gen. John C. Millard. \u201cBy conducting a thorough review and investigation, we hope to provide answers to the families of brave Airmen that lost their lives and prevent future occurrences and tragedies.\u201d\n\nMillard\u2019s team spent close to a month reviewing an array of evidence including interviews, logs, video, briefing materials, and inspection of aircraft wreckage before assembling a detailed sequence of events surrounding the crash.\n\nAccording to the report, the left outermost engine experienced problems and investigators found that the crew\u2019s mismanagement of the malfunction deviated from standard procedures. Failure to follow those procedures made further action by the pilot result in loss of control of the aircraft, causing it to crash.\n\nThe plane was assigned to a crew from the 156th Airlift Wing in Muniz Air Base from Puerto Rico. Their mission was to deliver the C-130 plane from Savannah to an Air Force base in Arizona commonly referred to as the \u201cBoneyard\u201d, where it would be decommissioned.\n\nThe pilot of the plane was previously identified as Maj.

The squadron used the plane to rescue Americans from the British Virgin Islands after Hurricane Irma, and later supplied food and water to Puerto Ricans desperate for help after Hurricane Maria.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Beto O'Rourke, the 2018 Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in Texas, makes his concession speech Tuesday night in El Paso. O'Rourke has been cited by some Democrats as a template for the party\u2019s 2020 nominee. (Eric Gay/AP)\n\nTuesday\u2019s midterm elections crystallized a choice among Democrats as they look to the 2020 presidential contest: Do they side with passion or pragmatism?\n\nAn energized segment within the party saw in the results a need for Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, or a candidate like him, who can inspire large crowds with an authentic and optimistic plea that rebukes President Trump, while only rarely mentioning him.\n\nOthers pointed to wins in the upper Midwest that suggest a wholly different formula, one that would rely on candidates like former vice president Joe Biden or Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio to stitch together the coalition of working-class voters that for decades helped put Democrats into the White House.\n\n\u201cI think we know what the ingredients are,\u201d said Rebecca Kirszner Katz, a Democratic strategist. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019re trying to figure out if that person exists.\u201d\n\nCandidates and party strategists in recent days have been working through the midterm results, looking for clues about what may resonate with voters, according to interviews with nearly two dozen candidates, aides and strategists.\n\nSome are daunted by Trump\u2019s strength and resilience even in a rough midterm election, suggesting the feat of unseating him is more difficult than many realize.\n\n\u201cThis was not a historic rebuke,\u201d said a Democratic strategist working for a prospective 2020 candidate, speaking on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment. \u201cHe\u2019s gotten his base to turn out twice. . . . I just don\u2019t think anybody should have any confidence. How many times do you have to be confident about Trump and then being proved wrong? People felt like 2016 was a fluke. And people are underestimating him again.\u201d\n\nOthers are optimistic about what they see as a loosening of Trump\u2019s grip on working-class voters who abandoned Democrats for him in 2016.\n\nWhat the midterm results did not do was cull a field that could be bigger and more unwieldy than any time in recent memory. Almost anyone pondering a bid could find a result that offered a reason to run, or just as quickly find a reason to take a pass.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the \u2018blue wall\u2019 reasserted itself again yielded some of the 2020 candidates an argument to say, \u2018I have the ability to appeal to Rust Belt voters, and that\u2019s the path to victory.\u2019 And I think they\u2019ll get a fair hearing on that,\u201d said Brian Fallon, a Democratic consultant who served as Hillary Clinton\u2019s press secretary in 2016. \u201cBut I tend to still think that activists in Iowa will still go where their heart leads them, and won\u2019t necessarily make some sort of pragmatic decision about who can appeal to Obama-Trump voters. They are more likely to gravitate to the candidate that most inspires them.\u201d\n\nThe debate between those options, which has played out quietly in the two years since Trump shocked the party and sent it into a leaderless tailspin, will be settled over the next year as a large field begins openly competing for various slices of the primary electorate. Already, candidates are recruiting staff members and identifying finance teams to help them in the first of many tests \u2014 raising money.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been aggressively building a national fundraising and political network, while Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) will follow up several recent trips to primary states with a high-profile book tour. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick is heading back to South Carolina on Friday, while Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said she\u2019s now considering a presidential bid after all but ruling it out.\n\nBefore now, one of the fundamental questions about the coming presidential campaign has been whether Democrats will push for a candidate to engage with Trump in a smash-mouth style that drives up partisans on both sides, or go for someone who attempts a more positive and uniting message. Many of the party\u2019s successes Tuesday leaned toward the latter.\n\n\u201cThe way to beat Trump is not to be like him,\u201d said David Axelrod, a Democratic consultant and former senior strategist for President Barack Obama. \u201cThere is this sort of debate of, \u2018Do you campaign with a clinched fist or an open hand?\u2019 The candidates who won did not win as instruments of destruction to Donald Trump. They ran for an alternate vision that was constructive and positive and spoke to the day-to-day concerns of people.\u201d\n\nCandidates like O\u2019Rourke \u2014 as well as gubernatorial candidates Andrew Gillum in Florida and Stacey Abrams in Georgia \u2014 ignited passion among Democrats across the country. They managed to raise huge amounts of money from everyday donors and created viral moments that propelled their state-based candidacies into national acclaim.\n\n\u201cIt was a template,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cThe thing that distinguished Beto O\u2019Rourke was not any one issue. It was his fundamental call to character, his fundamental call to community. I think there\u2019s a big lesson in that. We tend to be very tactical and parochial in how we think about these things. But there\u2019s something happening out there. I think the country is hungry for that.\u201d\n\nBut O\u2019Rourke didn\u2019t focus on Trump. And as the Democratic primary gets underway, there remain thirsty calls for a more aggressive posture against the president.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to beat this guy talking about puppies and daisies,\u201d said lawyer Michael Avenatti. \u201cYou have to inspire people, but you can\u2019t inspire people to win against Trump. Not in 2020. It\u2019s not going to happen. You have to get in the gutter with this guy and take shots. You have to take a lot of punishment and give a lot of punishment. He\u2019s going to roll over a nominee who seeks to be cheerleader.\u201d\n\nAvenatti gained national attention representing Stormy Daniels, who has claimed she and Trump had a dalliance. He has said he is considering a presidential bid on the basis that he is uniquely positioned to engage with Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not who among the Democrats can make the best president. If the Democrats answer that question they\u2019re very likely to lose the election in 2020,\u201d Avenatti said. \u201cThe question is: Who matches up against this particular individual at this point in time?\u201d\n\nWarren may attempt to cast herself as someone who can unite the different desires within the party \u2014 as the author of a populist message that could play well in the Midwest but who also has a knack for capitalizing on passionate and viral moments.\n\nDistinguishing herself from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who occupied similar political space in the 2016 campaign and may attempt to run again, she is also hoping to tap into the vast new energy of female candidates and activists.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, on a very dark election night, millions of women watched in horror as Donald Trump was elected president,\u201d she said in her victory speech Tuesday. \u201cThey didn\u2019t like it. But they didn\u2019t whimper. They didn\u2019t whine. They fought back. . . . And that is how real change begins.\u201d\n\nThere are quieter candidates, too, hoping to burst onto the national scene. Some have pointed toward Mitch Landrieu, the former mayor of New Orleans, as having raw political talent and a record of speaking forcefully against racism. Outgoing Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who helped campaign for candidates during the midterms, is planning to spend the coming months evaluating whether to run on a platform of bipartisan governance.\n\n\u201cAcross the Midwest we saw good pragmatic candidates who really wanted to get things done. They weren\u2019t looking for a soapbox and a place to shout out their ideas,\u201d Hickenlooper said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost the opposite of Trump; it\u2019s the antidote to Trump, where neither side ends up ecstatic or thrilled with the compromise. But everyone realizes this is progress. That\u2019s the way politics used to be in this country.\u201d\n\nBut his candidacy would test the question of whether there is space for that kind of politics.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the $62,000 question,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t create media.\u201d\n\nHeading into the midterm elections, many Democrats were hoping their flashy new stars \u2014 especially O\u2019Rourke, Gillum and Abrams \u2014 would win decisive victories, proving definitively that unabashedly liberal, young and dynamic candidates were the future not only of the party but of a rapidly diversifying country.\n\n\u201cPeople want us to chase this unicorn, the Obama-Trump voters,\u201d said Bakari Sellers, a political commentator and former South Carolina state representative. \u201cWe need to focus on the energy in our party. We just can\u2019t do the same thing we have been doing.\u201d\n\nBut none of the three won Tuesday \u2014 O\u2019Rourke was defeated, and Gillum\u2019s and Abrams\u2019s races remain up in the air. Some suggest that underscores the limits of the passion candidates, who tend to rile up both sides. Democrats running as more pragmatic messengers to working-class voters in states Trump won could at least claim success.\n\nBrown, who won reelection in Ohio and is known for his rumpled suits and raspy voice, raised eyebrows with an election night speech that implored Democrats to follow his path \u2014 if not him specifically.\n\n\u201cPopulists are not racists. Populists are not anti-Semitic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not appeal to some by pushing down others. We do not lie. We do not engage in hate speech. And we do not rip babies from their families at the border.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will show America how we celebrate organized labor and all workers \u2014 the waitress in Dayton, the office worker in Toledo, the nurse in Columbus, the mineworker in Coshocton,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat is the message coming out of Ohio in 2018, and that is the blueprint for our nation in 2020.\u201d\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar shares that lane after winning an easy reelection in Minnesota. Biden, who has made a career of calling himself \u201cmiddle-class Joe,\u201d is also a beneficiary of a strategy that goes through the Midwest.\n\nWithout a candidate who can relate to voters there, some Democrats argue, Trump has a chance to bounce back in the very places he won the presidency. Even amid Democratic wins in the Midwest on Tuesday, there were signs Trump had improved his standing.\n\nIn Michigan, where Democrat Gretchen Whitmer won the governorship, exit polls had Trump\u2019s approval rating at 44 percent. When Trump won the state in 2016, his favorability rating in exit polls was 39 percent.\n\n\u201cThe path for the Democrats runs through the Rust Belt. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any getting away from it,\u201d said Larry Rasky, a longtime Biden confidant and campaign strategist. \u201cThat\u2019s where Trump won. It\u2019s where he turned the tables, and it\u2019s where he lost Tuesday night.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you just do the math in 2020 it\u2019s hard to see a path for Democrats that doesn\u2019t start in Pennsylvania and end in Minnesota,\u201d Rasky said. \u201cThat formula was proved again Tuesday night. It\u2019s not that there aren\u2019t other ways to get there, but if we\u2019re going to rely on Texas and Florida to win in 2020, let\u2019s just find a pair of aces for a full house.\u201d\n\nA previous version of this story contained a graphic that showed Idaho and Maine as having two Democratic Senators.

The track held a moment of silence before the afternoon\u2019s first race at 1 o\u2019clock.\n\nAcuna was a native of Cuba who had worked for McPeek for close to a decade. Churchill Downs officials said he was focused on saving money to bring his wife and three sons, including twin boys, from Cuba to Kentucky.

He also apparently doesn\u2019t care much for the ones who died for their country.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, the president was scheduled to attend a ceremony at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, where 2,289 U.S. soldiers are buried \u2014 a small part of the 116,000 Americans who gave the last full measure of devotion during World War I. It was the sort of solemn occasion that U.S. presidents have considered an integral part of their duty at least since the Gettysburg Address. But Trump couldn\u2019t be bothered.\n\nThe White House explained that bad weather grounded the helicopters that Trump and his entourage were planning to take. Yet somehow bad weather did not prevent French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel or Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau from attending outdoor ceremonies commemorating the end of World War I that afternoon. Somehow bad weather did not stop Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and retired general John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, from attending the very ceremony that Trump could not make.\n\nRather than make the hour-long drive (Aisne-Marne is only 55 miles from Paris), the low-energy president remained behind at the U.S. ambassador\u2019s residence. It\u2019s not as if he didn\u2019t sacrifice anything, however. Odds are that his room didn\u2019t have Fox News. So he was probably reduced to watching CNN all afternoon. If the New York dating scene was Trump\u2019s personal Vietnam, this was his personal Verdun.\n\nThe irony is that Trump prides himself on being pro-military. When asked this week to comment on Michelle Obama\u2019s new memoir, in which she wrote that she could never forgive him for spreading the \u201ccrazy and mean-spirited\u201d birtherism conspiracy theory, he replied that he could never forgive President Barack Obama for \u201cwhat he did to our United States military.\u201d And what did Barack Obama do that was so awful? He spent a little less for defense than Trump is.\n\nTrump is right that he and the Republican Congress have increased defense spending \u2014 it has gone from roughly $600 billion to $700 billion a year \u2014 but he\u2019s wrong to blame Obama alone for the lower levels during his presidency. The budget-squeezing sequestration process was a bipartisan initiative designed to cut the deficit without tax increases. What Trump doesn\u2019t understand is that showering money on the armed forces doesn\u2019t mean that he respects or supports what they do.\n\nTrump shows what he really thinks of the troops by using them as political props. He deployed 5,600 troops just before the midterm elections to guard against the supposed threat posed by a few thousand unarmed refugees hundreds of miles from the U.S. border. He even suggested that the troops should commit the war crime of opening fire on migrants who threw rocks.\n\nThe Pentagon grandly dubbed this Operation Faithful Patriot and circulated pictures of troops in full \u201cbattle rattle\u201d stringing barbed wire, only to quietly drop the ludicrous moniker amid Election Day. Conveniently enough, Trump and his friends at Fox essentially stopped speaking about the caravan once the votes were cast. But, as the New York Times reports, the troops are still in the field, without electricity or hot meals \u2014 or a mission. They will likely spend Thanksgiving away from their families.\n\nNaturally, Trump will not bother to visit them, even though there is no risk in traveling to Texas. He still has not visited U.S. troops deployed to a war zone \u2014 although he has spent 72 days at Mar-a-Lago and 58 days at his Bedminster, N.J., golf club.\n\nTo add insult to injury, consider Trump\u2019s reaction after Ian David Long, a Marine veteran of Afghanistan, killed 12 people in a Thousand Oaks, Calif., bar this past week. Trump called him a \u201cvery sick puppy\u201d and blamed his rampage on post-traumatic stress disorder without any actual evidence. (A high school track teacher reported that Long physically menaced her long before he joined the Marine Corps.) \u201cPeople come back \u2014 that\u2019s why it\u2019s a horrific thing \u2014 they come back, they\u2019re never the same,\u201d the president said.\n\nThis is precisely the kind of pernicious stereotype \u2014 that veterans are ticking time bombs \u2014 that veterans groups have worked so hard to refute. It simply isn\u2019t true, and it demeans the service of countless soldiers who serve honorably and return to live peaceful, productive lives. \u201cComments like this one from the Commander in Chief are extremely unhelpful,\u201d Paul Rieckhoff of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America told The Post.\n\nSo much for Trump\u2019s conceit that he is pro-military. It has about as much factual foundation as his claim not to know his newly appointed acting attorney general. He has no understanding of what soldiers do or the honor code by which they live. His idea of military service is marching in a parade \u2014 and he is peeved he couldn\u2019t have one in Washington this Veterans Day. Through his words and deeds, the commander in chief shows his contempt for the men and women in uniform.", "U.S President Donald Trump gestures outside the Elysee Palace after his talks with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, Saturday, Nov.10, 2018.

(Deb Lindsey/For The Washington Post)\n\nTwo major studies released Saturday provide evidence that medications derived from fish oil are effective in protecting people from fatal heart attacks, strokes and other forms of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe large, multiyear research efforts tested different formulations and quantities of drugs made with Omega-3 fatty acids on two groups of people: one that suffered from cardiovascular disease or diabetes and another that represented the general population. Both studies found that people who took the drugs every day enjoyed protection against some heart and circulatory problems compared with those given a placebo.\n\nIn a look at another commonly consumed supplement, vitamin D, researchers found no effect on heart disease but saw a link to a decline in cancer deaths over time.\n\nThe research was released Saturday at the American Heart Association\u2019s 2018 Scientific Sessions in Chicago and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAbout 43 million people in the United States take statins to lower LDL, or \u201cbad,\u201d cholesterol, and the drugs are credited with reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes. But heart disease remains the leading killer of Americans. In recent years, a long, steady decrease in heart disease deaths has slowed. So researchers are seeking other ways to combat cardiovascular disease beyond known protective factors such as changes in diet, exercise and smoking habits.\n\nOne of the studies unveiled Saturday, named by the acronym REDUCE-IT, determined that people with cardiovascular disease who were already taking statins stood less chance of serious heart issues when they were also given two grams of the drug Vascepa (icosapent ethyl) twice a day.\n\nThe drug is a purified version of a fish-oil component that targets triglycerides, another type of fat in the blood. Elevated triglycerides can harden or thicken arteries, potentially leading to strokes and heart attacks. People who took the drug were compared with those who were given a placebo. The study involved more than 8,000 people.\n\nThe drug is made by Amarin Corp., which sponsored the research. In September, Amarin announced that the study had met its primary goals.\n\nDeepak L. Bhatt, executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, who led the study, said the results could change the practice of cardiology in the same way that the introduction of statins did more than 30 years ago.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019ve been doing clinical trials for a long time. And I\u2019ve not been involved in a trial that has this much potential to improve the lives of perhaps tens of millions of people,\u201d Bhatt said.\n\nIn 2007, a large study in Japan determined that the same component of fish oil used in the REDUCE-IT study showed promise in protecting against cardiovascular problems. But that research did not compare the substance against a placebo, and was complicated by the large amount of fish in the typical Japanese diet.\n\nThe other fish-oil study released Saturday, called VITAL, looked at the effect of a different formulation of Omega-3 fatty acids in a drug called Lovaza. Researchers followed nearly 26,000 people for a median of more than five years. The results suggested that people given the drug were 28 percent less likely to suffer heart attacks than those given a placebo, and 8 percent less likely to have a variety of cardiovascular events. The effect was even more pronounced among African Americans, but the lead researcher said the results need further study before they can be relied upon.\n\nPeople who ate fewer than 1.5 servings of fish weekly saw a drop in the number of heart attacks suffered when they increased their consumption of Omega-3s by taking the drug. The study did not find a decline in strokes.\n\nJoAnne Manson, chief of the division of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, who led the study, said it \u201cfurther supports . . . the benefits of Omega-3 in heart health.\u201d\n\nManson called the results \u201cpromising signals\u201d about fish-oil consumption, but said they are not conclusive enough to compel people to begin taking the drug or fish-oil supplements. The study also showed that the medication is safe enough that people already taking fish oil have no reason to stop, she said in an interview.\n\nPeople in the study were given 840 milligrams of the key fatty acids in fish oil each day, less than is found in a typical serving of salmon.\n\n\u201cWe would encourage starting with more fish in the diet and having at least two servings a week,\u201d Manson said. \u201cOne advantage of doing it through the diet . . . is that fish can replace red meat, saturated fat and processed food.\u201d\n\nLovaza is manufactured by GSK, but is available in generic form. The study was sponsored by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe VITAL study also looked at vitamin D, which is often recommended to improve bone health in older women and for overall health in other people. It found that the vitamin had no effect on heart attacks or strokes and did not affect the incidence of cancer.\n\nBut vitamin D consumption may have some role in reducing the number of deaths from cancer two or more years later, the research showed. Manson suggested that vitamin D may help prevent cancers from metastasizing or becoming more invasive. But she said that idea needs more research.\n\nShe said people already taking modest amounts vitamin D, especially on the advice of doctors, have no reason to stop. But she warned against taking huge doses of the vitamin, such as 5,000 or 10,000 international units a day, unless a clinician recommends it, because the safety of that practice is not known.\n\nRead more\n\nFive years of fitness reporting and one lesson: Just move\n\nCalcium and vitamin D supplements may not protect against bone fractures\n\nLow-dose aspirin offers no overall benefit for healthy older people", "Pepperdine University\u2019s 3,600 undergraduates were ordered to shelter in place Friday as a wildfire closed in on the Malibu campus.

(Calla Kessler/The Washington Post)\n\nWhen I watched CNN correspondent Jim Acosta clash with President Trump on live television, I was captivated, and a bit envious. Watching the subsequent suspension of his White House credentials (after the fake accusation that he was inappropriate with a female staffer who attempted to wrest the microphone away from him), my American media friends are convinced that this represents shrinking freedom for the U.S. media.\n\nIronically for us in India, the entire showdown represented a moment of freedom \u2014 at least at first. This sort of direct, combative altercation is frankly unimaginable between any head of government in India and any reporter I know, including myself. Here, Acosta and Peter Alexander, who stood up for him and got into his own argument with Trump, would have been most likely sacked from their jobs or, at least, put on notice. And such an extended, open press conference, where reporters can assertively assume the right to persistently follow up on their questions to the most powerful politician in the country, would never have taken place at all.\n\nDespite the derision that seems to be the defining quality of Trump\u2019s relationship with the U.S. media, that the world\u2019s most powerful man persisted with the press conference and almost seemed to revel in the volley of angry questions from the floor was astonishing by Indian standards. Of course, our top politicians would never behave in Trump\u2019s demented manner. But nor would they have been ready for this sort of antagonistic line of questioning at a press conference \u2014 that is, if they would even hold one in the first place.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has given sit-down interviews to carefully chosen journalists, at home and abroad. But in four years, he has not held a single free-wheeling press conference where reporters on the beat can grill him. His predecessor Manmohan Singh used to have an annual media conference but for the most part shut out individual television interviews. Sonia Gandhi, the power behind Singh\u2019s throne, remained largely elusive to journalists. In other words, Indian media does not know either an Acosta or a Trump.\n\nEven if you attribute Trump\u2019s willingness to engage the same media he attacks and loathes to be representative of his own narcissism, there is an institutional press freedom in the United States that we simply do not have here in India. The rights of the First Amendment have been genuinely absorbed in the political culture of America; Trump has to grin and bear the scathing satire of a Stephen Colbert or a Hasan Minhaj.\n\nIndia is different. I ask my colleagues who berated Trump on social media for his treatment of Acosta: Shouldn\u2019t we start by finding our individual voices at home first?\n\nThe truth is that the Indian mainstream media has been steadily defanged. This is particularly true for television media. While Modi would never behave in an unhinged, Trumpian manner, he does share one thing in common with the U.S. president: a belief that liberal journalists are his enemy. This goes back to his years as chief minister of Gujarat, where he believes the media was unfair to him in its reporting of the anti-Muslim pogrom of 2002. As prime minister, he has withdrawn the long-held tradition of journalists traveling with him on his trips abroad. Also gone with this policy shift is the prime minister\u2019s customary onboard press conference. Access to information, background briefings, even informal meetings have been severely curtailed, especially for journalists rumored to not be liked by the regime. And our fraternity has not risen as one against these penalties.\n\nThat\u2019s why I was especially delighted to see the U.S. media strongly protest the withdrawal of White House accreditation to Acosta. Some journalists like to mock what they call \u201caccess journalism,\u201d but blocking a reporter from meeting her sources or making sure that the administration is wary of engaging her is also a form of press intimidation, albeit a more covert and insidious one. These days, the opposition India National Congress party often calls out the press for being too supplicant and the government for being too closed. But, the party\u2019s record on freedom is blotted in large part by the shadow of the 1975 Emergency, which saw sweeping restrictions imposed by then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi that throttled the national media. The Congress party has not disowned those years unequivocally enough. Besides, once politicians work out that the media can be nudged into docility, no party is likely to give up the advantage if it gets elected.\n\nMeanwhile, Indian prime-time news has become mostly a dangerous exercise in populism, even bordering on majoritarianism. Either networks are sycophantic or there is the odd channel here or there that is antigovernment (as a result of being spurred on by political activism). Neither is healthy for journalism. The eruption of hundreds of news channels has not meant greater professionalism. The individual brilliance of journalists has not been able to offer a warranty to the news media against a flawed revenue model. Most media groups are owned by industrialists who in turn are dependent on the government of the day for permissions and clearances and respite from potential tax entanglements. Worse, with people unwilling to pay for news, organizations draw a large chunk of earnings from government advertisements, handing over a level of control.\n\nAs the world\u2019s largest democracy, India is a raucous, argumentative and opinionated country. But our media could do with an Indian version of an ironclad First Amendment. Till then, we can only draw vicarious pleasure \u2014 and angst \u2014 from the goings-on in America\u2019s media.\n\nRead more:\n\nErik Wemple: White House goes authoritarian on CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta\n\nMolly Roberts: Sarah Sanders\u2019s diabolically clever attack on Jim Acosta\n\nJennifer Rubin: Acosta should sue the president, and Americans should shun Sanders\n\nMelissa Chan: I was an out-of-line reporter in China.

Nor will it alone change the trajectory of Yemen\u2019s war, they said, or its growing humanitarian crisis, which now includes more than 14 million people on the brink of famine \u2014 more than half of Yemen\u2019s population.\n\nThe United States, Britain and other Western powers continue to assist the coalition with intelligence, logistical support and sales of billions of dollars in weaponry, much of it being used in the conflict in Yemen, the Middle East\u2019s poorest nation.\n\nSaudi Arabia on Friday night claimed that it had asked the Pentagon to stop aerial refueling of its warplanes because its forces were capable of performing the task themselves.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. decision to stop refueling coalition aircraft is significant because it implies that the U.S. is trying to distance itself from the devastating impact on civilians of poorly targeted airstrikes,\u201d said Elisabeth Kendall, a Yemen scholar at Oxford University. \u201cBut it is not a military game changer.\u201d\n\n\n\nYemeni pro-government forces gather on the eastern outskirts of the port city of Hodeida as they battle Houthi rebels on Friday. (Stringer/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n[A rare rebuff of Saudi allies by Trump administration]\n\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other Sunni Muslim countries in the coalition are seeking to oust Shiite Houthi rebel forces, who the United States and allies say are backed by Iran. Tehran denies this.\n\nThe goal of the Saudi-led campaign is to restore Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government, which was driven out of the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, in 2015, and to prevent Iran from gaining a foothold on the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nOn Saturday, the Houthi deputy minister of information, Fahmi al-Yusufi, described the U.S. decision as an \u201cassurance for those opposing the American involvement in the aggression\u201d by the Saudi-led coalition.\n\nAnother Houthi political official dismissed the refueling stoppage as incremental because the United States is still providing intelligence and other logistical support, as well as sending U.S. military trainers to Saudi Arabia to help in the war effort.\n\nThe U.S. move \u201cwill have an effect on the duration of their aircraft in the air, but it will not paralyze the aggression\u2019s ability to escalate the conflict,\u201d said the official, Mohammed Albukhaiti. \u201cThe siege on Yemen is a U.S. and Western siege because such a siege is beyond the capabilities of Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\u201d\n\n[Saudi role in Yemen war under new scrutiny after Khashoggi killing]\n\nThe U.S. refueling of coalition aircraft has long been controversial because of the large numbers of civilians that have been killed in coalition airstrikes. The United Nations estimates that at least 10,000 have died, but other reputable organizations have tallied more than 50,000 killed since the war began more than three years ago.\n\nCoalition airstrikes have struck hospitals, health clinics, weddings, funerals, factories and other nonmilitary targets. Human rights groups and The Washington Post have observed fragments of U.S.-made munitions at numerous attack sites.\n\nIn August, more than 40 children were killed when a U.S.-made bomb hit their school bus during a coalition airstrike. Saudi Arabia initially claimed that Houthi fighters were on the bus but recanted amid international pressure triggered by images of the bloody aftermath.\n\nAfter each airstrike, Yemenis often blame the United States in the same breath as the Saudi-led coalition for the tragedies. Human rights activists have suggested that the United States could be complicit in war crimes in Yemen.\n\nThe mounting civilian death toll, despite promises by the coalition to be more careful in its targeting, brought increasing focus on ending the U.S. refueling from U.S. lawmakers who are seeking to curb arms sales to Saudi Arabia and end U.S. involvement in Yemen\u2019s war.\n\nIn recent congressional hearings, it became clear that the Pentagon had little oversight of Saudi Arabia\u2019s military activities in Yemen. In March, Army Gen. Joseph Votel, the head of U.S. Central Command, told Congress that U.S. forces did not track whether U.S. fuel or munitions had been used in coalition operations that resulted in civilian deaths.\n\nHuman rights activists on Saturday said the U.S. decision to end the refueling support was long overdue.\n\n[U.S. Navy seizes weapons off coast of Yemen]\n\n\u201cAny step aimed at reining in the Saudi Arabian and UAE-led coalition\u2019s reckless aerial bombardment of civilian areas in Yemen is a step in the right direction,\u201d said Amnesty International\u2019s Middle East research director, Lynn Maalouf.\n\nBut the refueling stoppage, she added, \u201cdoes not go far enough,\u201d\n\nKristine Beckerle, the Yemen researcher for Human Rights Watch, said \u201cthe decision to end refueling is a clear, if extremely belated, acknowledgment of the awful way the coalition has been waging this war, and the risks the U.S. has taken when it comes to complicity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. and other coalition allies should be seizing this moment to suspend all arms sales, demand an end to abuses and call for accountability for the too many we\u2019ve already seen,\u201d Beckerle added.\n\nThe refueling halt comes as the coalition has mounted a fierce offensive on the Yemeni port city of Hodeida in the past week. Scores of airstrikes have struck in and around the city. Civilian casualties are again mounting amid the air assaults and shelling. The port is the main gateway for much of the food, fuel, medicines and humanitarian aid entering northern Yemen, home to 80 percent of the country\u2019s population.\n\nWith the Hodeida offensive threatening to deepen the crisis, aid workers hope the United States will go further to help Yemenis.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has an opportunity to continue taking steps that make a very real difference for people in Yemen,\u201d said Suze van Meegen, protection and advocacy adviser in Yemen for the Norwegian Refugee Council.\n\nAmong those steps, she said, were \u201cpushing for an immediate cease-fire\u201d and making sure that \u201call seaports and airports in the country are open and functioning, allowing for the swift transportation of food, fuel and people in need of medical treatment.\u201d\n\nWith Friday\u2019s decision, more of the responsibility for preventing civilian casualties will fall squarely on the Saudis. It remains to be seen whether the Trump administration will be pressured to do more to rein in the coalition.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia has framed the announcement as a win, claiming that it requested the U.S. to stop refueling its aircraft because its own improved military professionalism means it can now do this for itself,\u201d Kendall said.\n\n\u201cThe question now is: Will this be enough to satisfy Congress that the U.S. cannot be held responsible for errant airstrikes, or is it just a first step to further measures?\u201d\n\nRaghavan reported from Cairo.\n\nRead more:\n\nU.N. warns of \u2018incalculable human cost\u2019 as Yemen offensive escalates\n\nMattis: U.S. aid to Saudi-led coalition \u2018not unconditional\u2019\n\nAfter dozens of children die in Yemen, pressure mounts on U.S.\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "\n\nPresident Trump announced he will posthumously bestow the Medal of Freedom, the country's top civilian honor upon baseball legend Babe Ruth. (Associated Press file photo) (AP/AP)\n\nPresident Trump will bestow the United States\u2019s top civilian honor upon three legendary sports figures, the White House announced Saturday.\n\nBabe Ruth, Roger Staubach and Alan Page will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom in a ceremony at the White House on Nov. 16. The award recognizes \u201cespecially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.\u201d\n\nThe trio joins a long and illustrious list of athletes to receive the honor, including Muhammad Ali, Jesse Owens and Michael Jordan. Ruth will become the 12th professional baseball player to be honored the award, the first being another former Yankees legend, Joe DiMaggio, who was selected by Gerald Ford in 1977. Staubach and Page are the first pro football players recognized.\n\nRuth, born George Herman \u201cBabe\u201d Ruth Jr. in Baltimore in 1895, played 22 seasons in the major leagues during which he hit 714 home runs to become baseball\u2019s \u201cSultan of Swat.\u201d He entered majors as a pitcher in 1915, when the home run was not a standard part of the game. Stadiums were built to keep the ball in play and maximize attendance. He died of cancer in 1948 at age 53.\n\nStaubach, 76, quarterbacked the Dallas Cowboys to Super Bowl victories in 1971 and 1977 and went to six Pro Bowls. Dallas never had a losing season in Staubach\u2019s eight years as the full-time starter and went to the playoffs seven of those years. The sustained period of excellence under Coach Tom Landry helped the Cowboys develop the reputation as \u201cAmerica\u2019s team.\u201d\n\nIn college, he won the 1963 Heisman trophy and led Navy to a No. 2 national ranking and the 1964 Cotton Bowl, the de facto national championship game that season. The Midshipemen fell, 28-6, to No. 1 Texas.\n\nStaubach clashed with Trump in 2016 after the president said the Army-Navy game was not \u201cnecessarily the best football.\u201d\n\nStaubach, who has historically campaigned for Republican political candidates, responded, \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on any political stuff but, service football is extremely respectable and very competitive. They\u2019ve won some big games. They are not in the top 10 this year or anything, but it\u2019s still good football. I really enjoy watching service football.\u201d\n\nPage, 73, was one of the original members of the Minnesota Vikings' \u201cPurple People Eaters\u201d defensive line and later became an associate justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court. He helped Notre Dame to the 1966 national championship. He was drafted by the Vikings in 1967 and was named NFL MVP in 1971. He played in four Super Bowls and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1988.\n\nDuring the final years of his football career, Page enrolled at the University of Minnesota\u2019s law school and practiced law privately until winning a seat on the Minnesota Supreme Court in 1992. He served on the bench for 20 years.\n\nTrump also will award the Medal of Freedom to Sen. Orrin G.

Trump is joining other world leaders at centennial commemorations in Paris this weekend to mark the end of World War I. (Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press)\n\nPARIS \u2014 After French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe needs to defend itself from the United States, aides said he was misunderstood.\n\nBut the idea isn\u2019t so far-fetched.\n\nMacron is leading a rearguard action to salvage the system of international cooperation the U.S. helped build, but which President Donald Trump has chipped away at since taking office.\n\nWhile Trump came all the way to Paris for commemorations marking 100 years since the armistice that ended World War I, he\u2019s skipping an international peace forum that Macron is launching Sunday.\n\nThe forum is part of Macron\u2019s efforts to defend the idea that nations need to work together instead of at each other\u2019s expense. But without the leader of the world\u2019s only remaining superpower, the forum will lose some of its sense.\n\nEurope feels deeply threatened, meanwhile, by Trump\u2019s declared plan to pull the U.S. out a nuclear treaty with Russia that Europeans see as a cornerstone of post-Cold War peace and their own security. The U.S. says Russia is violating it anyway.\n\nThe tension overshadowed the two presidents\u2019 latest meeting Saturday at the French presidential palace. A French official present at the meeting said Macron made the point that in making decisions about treaties like the one Trump said he would abandon, the U.S. \u201cshould not forget something under your nose, which is European allies.\u201d\n\nMost Americans have never heard of the treaty that\u2019s being scrapped, but it has a clear meaning for European policymakers. The 1987 Intermediary-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty grew out of years of friction over a Soviet nuclear buildup and a threatened retaliatory U.S. missile deployment in Europe.\n\nMacron has warned that if the treaty is scrapped and Russia resumes building the kind of missiles it banned, the weapons could easily reach European targets \u2014 but not the U.S.\n\nAnother sore point for Macron and Trump: the question of a joint European army, which Macron has championed but which could overlap with the U.S.-led NATO alliance.\n\nMacron said in an interview this week with Europe-1 radio that when it comes to the cyber-sphere and the threat to pull out of nuclear treaties, \u201cWe should protect ourselves when it comes to China, Russia and even the United States.\u201d\n\nLater in the interview, the French leader talked about a European army. Trump lumped the two topics together and tweeted as Air Force One landed in Paris on Friday night that it was \u201cinsulting\u201d Macron wanted an army to defend Europe from the U.S.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet was especially wounding to Macron, one of the strongest U.S. allies in Europe.\n\nThe idea that Macron would see the United States as an adversary \u201cis totally against our alliance and our 250-year history. France and the U.S. have been side by side,\u201d another French official said, evoking World War I battlefields where U.S. and French soldiers fought on the same side and the nations\u2019 joint operation against Syria earlier this year.\n\nWhen Macron first took power, he expressed hope that he might be able to have a restraining influence on Trump, then newly elected like him.\n\nBut by pulling the United States out of a climate-change deal signed in Paris and other international deals that France embraces \u2014 and now, with his undiplomatic tweet before meeting Macron \u2014 Trump has made clear that the French leader is not holding the reins.\n\nMacron and his aides scrambled Saturday to clarify what the president views as the threats Europe faces today. Among them: Russia\u2019s political meddling and military buildup, as well as a sense that Trump is abandoning U.S. commitments to European allies.\n\nMacron pointed out that he pledged to boost France\u2019s military spending even before Trump upbraided NATO members last year for not paying enough for their own defense.\n\nThe tense exchange with Trump is just the latest challenge for Macron, who was seen as a bulwark against rising European nationalism when he was elected a year ago.\n\nThe pro-business, pro-EU president is increasingly weakened domestically for unpopular economic policies and isolated in Europe, where nationalist groups have gained ground.\n\n___\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press\u2019 WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___\n\nWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition.

It will not be the first round of fundraising reports next spring or spikes on the applause meter at the first few cattle calls for prospective Democratic candidates. Instead it will unfold in the nation\u2019s capital in the test of wills between the leader of the new Democratic-controlled House and President Trump.\n\nThat leader could well be Nancy Pelosi, the current House minority leader and former House speaker. Pelosi (D-Calif.) was the star of many Republican ads run during the election this fall and a favorite foil of the president. She is said by Republicans to be a toxic political figure to the GOP base. She is also a tough and shrewd politician and a skilled legislator who led her party to victory last Tuesday.\n\nMany Democratic candidates ran away from her during the campaign, however, vowing not to support her for another term as Democratic leader. She mostly ignored that during the campaign, urging candidates to do whatever they needed, but to \u201cjust win, baby,\u201d as she put it during an appearance at Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics in October.\n\nHer post-election moves have signaled no concern on her part that she will not be elected speaker. The day after the election, she held a news conference immediately after the president\u2019s encounter with the White House press corps. She followed that with a prime-time interview on CNN and with steps and announcements about House business. She continues to be the face of a Democratic Party that now has power to confront the president in ways they could not during the past two years.\n\nPelosi plays her cards close. The moment of truth for those in her party who would not like to see her as speaker will come soon. As early as this week there could be a better indication of just how real the threat to her bid for speaker is. At this point, there is no challenger who has stepped forward, only names bandied about. Her allies continue to express near-total confidence that she will prevail. The coming days will reveal whether she underestimates the desire for new leadership in a new House.\n\nNo matter the outcome of the leadership elections, what the Democratic leaders do with the power they now have could enhance the chances of the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nominee winning the White House, or it could diminish them and give Trump a head start on reelection. There is precedent for the latter that provides lessons for the new Democratic majority in the House.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump and Vice President Pence meet with congressional leaders House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R- Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) at the White House on Dec. 7, 2017. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\n[Elections unleash majority-size ambitions among younger Democrats]\n\nAt this moment 24 years ago, Newt Gingrich was the king of Washington, the giant killer who had ended 40 years of Democratic rule in the House. The Georgia Republican had the whole of center stage, in Washington and nationally, with power and a Contract with America that he was determined to implement. Then-President Bill Clinton was a politically battered and diminished figure in the aftermath of the 1994 midterm elections.\n\nA year later, things looked far different. Gingrich got drawn into a standoff with Clinton over the budget, which resulted in a government shutdown, for which he and his party got most of the blame. He was caricatured in a New York tabloid as a crybaby after complaining about not being able to talk to the president during a flight on Air Force One. His speakership took a hit, and the collateral damage turned out to be Bob Dole\u2019s hopes of defeating Clinton in the 1996 election.\n\nDole, then the Republican leader in the Senate and the front-runner for the GOP nomination, found himself through the whole of 1995 as a hostage to Gingrich and the rambunctious House Republicans. He was strapped in for the ride with Gingrich and had no ability to separate himself.\n\nBy the early spring of 1996, the Democrats launched an ad blitz linking Dole and Gingrich that left a permanent impression on the electorate, the \u201cDole-Gingrich monster,\u201d as Scott Reed, who was Dole\u2019s campaign manager in that campaign, called it.\n\n\u201cIt was the demonizing of Newt, and Newt taking that bait,\u201d he said. Reed suspects Trump will find something different in Pelosi, if she is the speaker starting in January. \u201cI think Pelosi is a lot smarter and more polished and understanding of the job,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s had the experience in the job, and she understands the back-and-forth with the president and the White House.\u201d\n\n[Democrats on track to pick up at least 35 seats in the House]\n\nPelosi has set out an agenda for House Democrats, starting with a package that would include reforms in campaign finance, voting rights and government operations. The agenda includes health care and infrastructure. On health care and infrastructure, the president might be prepared to deal with the Democrats, a mutually beneficial coming together that could happen if the stars align.\n\nBut it\u2019s the other part of the Democrats\u2019 agenda that will complicate the relationship with Trump, as he made clear in his post-election news conference. House Democrats will have the power to exercise oversight of the administration, which the current Republican majority has failed to do. How far and how aggressively it goes is the question that will set the tone for the next year, perhaps more. Trump warned of total war if Democrats go down that road, without specifying his red lines.\n\nPelosi has been careful and cautious in her comments about the investigative powers, particularly on the question of opening an impeachment inquiry. She has been in regular communication with the lawmakers who will oversee the key committees. She has said repeatedly that there should be no effort to impeach a president for political reasons.\n\nIf special counsel Robert S. Mueller III comes forward with a report that involves crimes or constitutional violations, the House almost certainly would move to impeach. But it is the gray area in between oversight of this or that agency and an investigation focused on the president that will require the exercise of judgment by the leader of the Democrats in the House.\n\nWhat no one can predict at this point is the pressure Pelosi, if she is speaker, and other top Democrats will feel from a grass-roots base eager to see the president taken on directly. Republicans with experience on Capitol Hill predict that the pressure on Democrats to move against the president could be overwhelming.\n\nOne lawmaker noted that many Democrats say they have to be careful not to overreach and likened that to Republicans who had said shutting down the government was not a good idea. \u201cThen they got 5,000 calls a day from constituents and they did,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think that Democrats are not going to be captive to that.\u201d\n\nPelosi knows her caucus, which has been her greatest strength as leader. But the midterm election was a reminder that the party\u2019s grass-roots supporters now have significant power. Whether that manifests itself as a left version of the Freedom Caucus in the House remains to be seen, but what has been stirred up in opposition to the president will be felt by House Democrats in the coming months. As one Republican legislator said of Pelosi, \u201cShe has to avoid becoming a foil in Trump\u2019s reelection bid.\u201d\n\nFirst, however, she must fend off a challenge within her own ranks. Her allies say she is ready for these challenges, from within and from the White House.

In that watershed document, the experts told doctors to stop trying to lower patients\u2019 cholesterol numbers to specific targets and instead follow an overall matrix that attempts to predict their future risk of problems.\n\nThe latest guidelines give clinicians a better idea of how to do that via treatment categories that vary depending on cholesterol scores and, if necessary, other tests. The 121-page document was unveiled Saturday at the American Heart Association\u2019s 2018 Scientific Sessions in Chicago and published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology and the heart association\u2019s journal, Circulation.\n\n\u201cWe essentially are endorsing and expanding the scope of the risk discussion,\u201d said Neil J. Stone, vice chairman of the committee that wrote the guidelines and a cardiology professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\nFor example, the guidelines recommend \u201chigh-intensity\u201d statin therapy for people under the age of 75 who are determined to have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, with the goal of reducing their low-density lipoproteins (LDL), or \u201cbad,\u201d cholesterol by 50 percent. In people aged 40 to 75 with diabetes, \u201cmoderate-intensity\u201d statin therapy is indicated regardless of the patient\u2019s 10-year risk of disease, according to another recommendation.\n\nHeart disease is the leading killer of Americans. Nearly a third of all U.S. adults have high LDL levels, a major cause of fatty deposits in arteries that lead to heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular problems.\n\nThe recommendations reaffirm the guiding principles of heart health that \u201clower is better\u201d when it comes to LDLs, and that people should try to achieve that first by living a healthy lifestyle, starting in childhood. That includes diet and exercise, controlling blood pressure and avoiding smoking, among other measures.\n\nWhen those steps aren\u2019t sufficient, the guidelines again endorse statins as the cornerstone of preventive treatment for people at risk of disease. About 43 million people in the United States take statins to lower their LDL levels. The drugs are credited with reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes.\n\nParag Joshi, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, who conducts research in preventive cardiology, said the guidelines combine the old emphasis on LDL scores with the approach outlined in 2013. The move away from LDL scores was loudly criticized by some clinicians when the 2013 recommendations were issued.\n\nJoshi said that in the intervening five years research has shown \u201creally high quality evidence that we can go for [LDL scores of] lower than 70 and do it with these [newer] medicines.\u201d\n\n\n\nTwo drugs have been developed since the last guidelines were issued in 2013, and the panel endorsed their use in cases when statins are not sufficient. For people who have suffered a heart attack or have numerous high-risk conditions, experts suggest adding ezetemibe. The drug, which is marketed as Zetia but is also available in generic form, decreases the amount of cholesterol absorbed in the small intestine.\n\nIn some cases, experts also recommend the use of PCSK9 inhibitors, powerful drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015 that block a substance that hinders the liver\u2019s ability to remove LDLs from the blood. The drugs, used mainly to treat an inherited disorder that causes very early heart attacks, are enormously expensive, and the panel offered physicians a way to assess their value.\n\nThe committee estimated PCSK9 inhibitors cost more than $150,000 for every good year of life added. Amgen, the drug company that makes the PCSK9 inhibitor Repatha, cut its list price in October to $5,850 per year to make it more affordable, a spokeswoman said.\n\nWhen doctors have a difficult time deciding how to treat patients, the committee suggests coronary artery calcium tests can be helpful in determining how much plaque has built up on the walls of certain blood vessels. They raised the prospect of beginning cholesterol testing much earlier in life, to identify children at risk of developing heart disease.\n\nRead more\n\nNew study expands response time after a stroke\n\nLow dose aspirin regimen shows no benefit in healthy older people\n\nHeart doctors are listening for clues about the future of stethoscopes", "\n\n(Peter Holley/The Washington Post) ((Photo courtesy of Peter Holley/The Washington Post))\n\nThe fast-growing electric-scooter company Lime has decided to immediately remove one of its models from every city across the globe after determining that it could break apart while in use.\n\nThe decision to suddenly pull the scooters off the streets came several weeks after the company said the same model occasionally breaks apart \u201cwhen subjected to repeated abuse.\u201d\n\nBut on Friday \u2014 in response to questions from The Washington Post about the scooters breaking apart under the strains of normal riding conditions \u2014 Lime said it was \u201clooking into reports that scooters manufactured by Okai may break and [that it is] working cooperatively with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and the relevant authorities internationally to get to the bottom of this.\u201d\n\nOkai is a Chinese manufacturer whose products include scooters. No one could be reached at an email address or a telephone number listed on its website \u2014 or at a telephone number provided by Lime.\n\nLime said it would decommission all Okai scooters in use in its fleets, but company officials said that determining the precise number of scooters affected by the recall was difficult and declined to provide an estimate. They also declined to say in how many U.S. cities the scooter model is in use.\n\nRiders across the country regularly report on social media that they\u2019ve seen Lime scooters broken in two, often where the baseboard meets the stem.\n\n\"Safety is Lime\u2019s highest priority,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThe vast majority of Lime\u2019s fleet is manufactured by other companies and decommissioned Okai scooters are being replaced with newer, more advanced scooters considered best in class for safety. We don\u2019t anticipate any real service disruptions.\u201d\n\n[Electric scooter giant Lime says it recalled scooters amid fears that some could catch on fire]\n\nThe mass removal comes several weeks after Lime \u2014 one of the nation\u2019s largest scooter companies \u2014 acknowledged that it had pulled thousands of its scooters off the streets this summer after discovering that a small number of them may have been carrying batteries with the potential to catch fire.\n\nThose scooters were made by the mobility company Segway, which pushed back against Lime\u2019s claims that a manufacturing defect made the scooters vulnerable to catching fire.\n\nSome Lime employees, riders and other affiliated individuals say they worry the company may not have moved fast enough to address concerns about the scooters breaking apart.\n\nAn independent contractor who charges Lime scooters overnight, known as a juicer, provided copies of emails showing that he had warned the company about the problem of scooters breaking as early as September.\n\nThe juicer, a man in his 40s named Ted, asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution. He said that a few weeks after he began working for Lime in July, he began noticing cracks in scooter baseboards and broken scooters on the street. He estimated that he found baseboard cracks in about 20 percent of the scooters he picked up to charge. Eventually, he highlighted the issue in a lengthy Reddit post that included multiple photos of broken scooters.\n\nIn an email dated Sept. 8 and addressed to Lime support, Ted warned Lime about four scooters with \u201ccracks on the underside of the deck,\u201d which he labeled a \u201csystematic issue.\u201d He included photos and an identification code for each device. Ted also asked about his payments for recharging the devices.\n\nA Lime employee responded to his email but did not address the scooter defects.\n\n\u201cThanks for your email and our apologies for the challenge,\u201d the employee wrote, referring to a question about payment. \u201cI have submitted your payment to Finance; please allow four to seven days for it to post. The payment will show as a \u2018bonus\u2019. We appreciate your patience and understanding.\u201d\n\nThe message prompted Ted to respond with another plea about safety.\n\n\u201cI hope the Lime team takes the issue of the cracking scooter decks seriously,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have dropped off 3 scooters now at the warehouse that were cracked completely in half, and 4 more that had started to crack. All of them have cracked in the same location.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe this is a design flaw that is beginning to surface,\u201d he added.\n\nTed said Lime did not respond. Lime declined to comment on his account.\n\n[Scooter use is rising in major cities. So are trips to the emergency room.]\n\nA Lime mechanic in California, who helps service the devices, said employees at his warehouse performing day-to-day maintenance on the company\u2019s scooters have identified scooters at risk of cracking over the past several months. This employee said managers did not aggressively follow up on those concerns. The mechanic spoke on the condition of anonymity and did not want to identify the city where he works for fear of revealing his identity.\n\nThe mechanic \u2014 who said employees monitored how long scooters remained functional after being deployed on city streets \u2014 said cracks could develop in the baseboard within days of a device being placed on the streets. The mechanic provided video of employees performing tests in which Lime scooters break after a few small hops. Later recounting the tests on the company\u2019s Slack messaging system, another mechanic noted to a manager that the device can snap even when the rider weighs as little as 145 pounds, according to images of the discussions provided to The Post.\n\n\u201cI would suggest that these are unsafe for public use,\u201d the other mechanic wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before someone is severely injured . . . if not here, somewhere else.\u201d\n\nResponding to a message on Slack, a manager said she had \u201craised concerns\u201d about the breaking scooters and been told that mechanics should continue testing the problematic scooters and \u201cwork on re-enforcement techniques.\u201d The manager wrote that she would forward photos of similar techniques that she had \u201cgathered from other markets.\u201d\n\nLime declined to comment on the mechanic\u2019s statements or the Slack exchange.\n\nA spokesman for the Consumer Product Safety Commission said the agency does not approve products before they reach the market. If a \u201csubstantial product hazard\u201d is reported by consumers and verified, the spokesman said, the agency could work with a company to issue a recall.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the issue,\u201d a CPSC spokeswoman said. \u201cCPSC is working with the firm to gather information and to protect consumers.\u201d\n\nSince Lime launched its scooters in the spring, two people have died while riding the devices, and others have been badly injured, according to authorities. When police located a scooter that Jacoby Stoneking had been riding when he sustained blunt-force head injuries in the early hours of Sept. 1, the device was snapped in half, though few other details about the accident are known, according to police and Lime officials. The 24-year-old east Dallas man died in a hospital the next day.\n\n\n\n(Stephen Williams) ((Photo courtesy of Stephen Williams))\n\nStoneking\u2019s death resonated with Stephen Williams, 29, a Dallas man who said he was injured when the scooter he was riding snapped in two on a busy city street on Oct. 10, throwing him to the ground chest-first. A week later, Williams said, he is still in pain.\n\nContemplating his accident, Williams \u2014 a data analyst at a technology company \u2014 remembered details of Stoneking\u2019s accident and wondered whether there was a pattern. He began searching for examples of broken Lime scooters, eventually logging more than 40 instances on social media, in news reports and on Reddit, including six that he personally encountered. Williams included those numbers in a wide-ranging review of e-scooters that he provided to the Texas Department of Transportation in Dallas, as well as to Lime.\n\n[Class-action lawsuit accuses e-scooter companies of \u2018gross negligence\u2019]\n\nHis verdict: In a city heavily reliant on cars for personal mobility, scooters have great potential to \u201cstitch\u201d the city \u201cback together,\u201d allowing people to travel to nearby neighborhoods without creating more traffic.

(Joe Giddens/PA via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nLEICESTER, England \u2014 The soundtrack to Leicester\u2019s sporting fairytale now carries a mournful melody.\n\nOn the streets where improbable success was toasted two years ago, the \u201cChampions of England\u201d chant reverberated again on Saturday, this time as the chorus for thousands of fans marching with players to the scene of unthinkable tragedy.\n\nA melancholic lyric has been added to honor the owner who made one of the greatest sporting underdog successes possible: \u201cChampions of England. You made us sing that.\u201d It is why Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha will always be held in deep regard by the people of Leicester, where soccer returned for the first time since the Thai entrepreneur\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThe Boss\u201d was the simple message on many T-shirts as up to 20,000 people embarked on a mile-long walk to the stadium where two weeks ago the 60-year-old Vichai died when his helicopter spiraled out of control shortly after taking off from the center circle.\n\nIt is the field where Vichai lifted the English Premier League trophy in May 2016, the culmination of an incredible journey taking an unglamorous team from the second tier to the pinnacle of English soccer for the first time. That was the day when tears of joy followed as tenor Andrea Bocelli serenaded manager Claudio Ranieri.\n\n\u201cTime to Say Goodbye\u201d carried a new sorrowful significance on Saturday. A recording of Bocelli was played in King Power Stadium after Saturday\u2019s 0-0 draw against Burnley as Vichai\u2019s son, vice chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, led the players around the field to thank fans who twirled white scarves emblazoned with \u201cForever in our hearts.\u201d\n\nRanieri, whose reign ended within months of the 5,000-1 longshot\u2019s title win, looked close to tears as he was back on the pitch to mourn the late chairman along with his predecessor and successor as manager.\n\n\u201cHis love and his passion helped us to achieve something amazing,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cSomething that will be remembered forever.\u201d\n\nThe very hiring of Ranieri to coach a team that had only just avoided relegation was a masterstroke by Vichai in 2015 but it looked bewildering at the time. The Italian had been out of work since the previous year after being fired by Greece, and his only job in England had ended 11 years earlier.\n\n\u201cWhen Ranieri went, people outside of Leicester were having a go at the chairman,\u201d season ticketholder Sam Collins said alongside friends on the memorial walk. \u201cNo Leicester fans were ever doing that.\u201d\n\nSuch was the affection they held for the billionaire who bought their financially struggling club in 2010 while in the second tier. In an era of mega-rich super clubs winning the English championship, it seemed unattainable for unfashionable teams like Leicester. With investment in the squad but not vast sums, Vichai made the impossible dream possible.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t support Leicester City to win things. Other people do that with other teams,\u201d fan Glyn Morgans, who has been coming to Leicester games since 1969, said on the 5,000-1 walk named after Leicester\u2019s title odds. \u201cLeicester people support Leicester because they are local people who love their local team.\u201d\n\nNow, though, Leicester is a name that resonates around the world.\n\n\u201cEven when we are on holiday people come up to us and say they are so pleased Leicester did it, a small club like Leicester,\u201d fan Margaret Bennett said as sunshine gave way to a downpour on the march to the stadium that was led by injured players, including title-winner Andy King and England defender Harry Maguire.\n\nThe hundreds of jerseys and floral tributes that amassed outside the stadium within days of the tragedy have been moved to an open space close to where Vichai\u2019s helicopter crashed in a ball of flames after the Oct. 27 night game against West Ham.\n\nGoalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel was still in the stadium an hour after the final whistle when he watched Vichai\u2019s blue aircraft take off as normal from the field, and he waved off the chairman. It was soon spiraling out of control and Schmeichel raced to the fire in a carpark.\n\n\u201cWhat happened next will stay with me forever,\u201d Schmeichel said in a 100-page matchday magazine dedicated completely to the five victims of the helicopter crash. \u201cIt has replayed through my head every minute since, wishing there was something more I could have done. I stood for a long time at the police cordon at the back of the carpark ... tears streaming down my face.\u201d\n\nSchmeichel was among the players who flew to Thailand a week ago to pay respects to Vichai at a Bangkok temple during a weeklong funeral ceremony.\n\nThe first chance to commemorate Vichai on matchday at the team\u2019s stadium carried an additional poignancy as wreaths were also laid and an additional minute\u2019s silence held to mark 100 years since the end of World War I.\n\n\u201cThis week has been hard,\u201d Leicester winger Marc Albrighton said. \u201cLeicester fans have been brilliant for us and we need them. It\u2019s going to be a tough road. The lads are emotionally drained. Today was one of the hardest games I have ever played.\u201d\n\nBefore the game, club officials including Aiyawatt viewed the area that has become a makeshift memorial to his father a few minutes\u2019 walk from the stadium. The Leicester vice chairman, who is also known as Top, inspected the carpet of flowers that have been formed in front of a picture of Vichai and the word \u201cboss\u201d in blue and white flowers. The hundreds of soccer jerseys and club banners from Leicester and rival clubs that were placed outside the stadium in the days after the disaster have now been placed on railings nearby.\n\nFans who traveled from the northwest city of Burnley added their only tributes and took inspiration from the 2016 success.\n\n\u201cEveryone was a Leicester fan that year,\u201d Burnley fan Roy Addison said. \u201cIt showed to a small club anything is possible. Nothing is impossible.\u201d\n\nGrief will, however, forever be associated with the glory here.\n\nPremier League executive chairman Richard Scudamore found a flicker of optimism at a dark moment. Supporters gathering in English streets holding banners of team owners usually signals discontent and protest. In Leicester, they have only affection for Vichai.\n\n\u201cThe reaction showed a huge tolerance,\u201d Scudamore said in the days after Vichai\u2019s death. \u201cIt\u2019s probably put to bed the idea there are foreign owners and there are English owners, and all the foreigners are bad and all the English owners are good.\u201d\n\nNow Leicester, with Claude Puel as coach, has to look to the future on the field with the team 10th in the 20-team standings.\n\nAlthough the 32,184 attendance on Saturday was the biggest crowd of the season, the owner\u2019s death two years after the title win seems like the closing of a chapter to some fans.\n\n\u201cGames are a bit weird now we\u2019ve had all that success,\u201d Collins, the fan, said. \u201cWhen you win and lose now it doesn\u2019t mean as much anymore because we\u2019ve been to the pinnacle.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nRob Harris is at www.twitter.com/RobHarris and www.facebook.com/RobHarrisReports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The event will not feature tanks or missiles like the parade Trump had envisioned on the streets of Washington on Veterans Day but canceled due to exorbitant costs.\n\nAfter another scheduled visit to a ceremony on Sunday, the president plans to fly home just as Macron\u2019s Paris Peace Forum kicks off for three days of meetings aimed at galvanizing global action on shared challenges, such as climate change.\n\nThomas Wright, a Europe expert at the Brookings Institution, noted Trump announced he was going to France on a whim in August after abruptly canceling his order for the Pentagon to stage a parade.\n\nThe Peace Forum was intended \u201ca bit as a counterpoint to \u2018America First,\u2019 \u201d Wright said, referring to Trump\u2019s nationalist foreign policy in which he has unsettled allies on trade and defense. \u201cNow they have this weird situation of Trump being there [in Paris] but the forum going against everything he and [National Security Adviser John] Bolton stand for. . . .

Bill Nelson (D) in the marquee contest shrinking to 12,562 votes out of nearly 8.2 million cast.\n\nThe 0.15 percent margin is narrow enough to not only trigger a machine recount, which by law must be completed by Thursday, but is likely to result in a recount by hand across the state \u2014 a complicated logistical task in the nation\u2019s biggest battleground state.\n\nThe new tally in the governor\u2019s race was not quite as close, but it also met the threshold for a voting machine recount. Numbers posted on the state election website showed Republican Ron DeSantis leading Democrat Andrew Gillum by 33,684 votes.\n\nPresident Trump immediately weighed in on Twitter, reiterating his unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud. \u201cTrying to STEAL two big elections in Florida! We are watching closely!\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s campaign declared a \u201cclose but decisive victory.\u201d The governor, who has also raised allegations of fraud, used his bully pulpit Saturday to encourage Florida sheriffs to keep an eye out for any violations of election laws. Nelson has accused Scott of using the power of his office to try to secure his Senate victory.\n\nBut the claims of fraud by the president and the governor were undercut Saturday by the Florida Department of State, which said in a statement it found \u201cno evidence of criminal activity at this time.\u201d\n\nRepublican suspicions have centered on Democratic-leaning Broward County, Florida\u2019s \u00adsecond-largest and the site of the \u201changing chads\u201d and other ballot irregularities during the 2000 presidential recount. The department, which oversees elections, had sent two monitors to observe Tuesday\u2019s vote in Broward as the result of a lawsuit over the mishandling of ballots in a 2016 congressional race.\n\nA spokeswoman for the department, Sarah Revell, said the observers were sent to \u201cmonitor the administration of the election, including visiting polling locations throughout the day as needed and observing preparation of the voting equipment and procedures for the election.\u201d The monitors have continued to watch the vote-counting this past week.\n\nRepublicans have been sharply critical of Brenda Snipes, supervisor of elections in Broward, blaming her for the slow pace of counting ballots and citing previous problems with voting under her watch.\n\nIn a brief interview, Snipes brushed off the criticism. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a hurricane, where things get really stirred up for a while and then it passes,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know when this will pass, but it will.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the governor called for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate the voting in South Florida \u2014 a probe the agency has so far declined to begin because the Department of State has not presented any allegations of fraud.\n\nThe 2018 Florida recount will include three statewide contests. Secretary of State Ken \u00adDetzner, a Scott appointee, officially ordered recounts Saturday in the races for Senate, governor and state agriculture commissioner, setting the stage for what could be weeks of partisan warfare.\n\nUnder Florida law, a statewide machine recount is conducted when the margin of victory is less than 0.5 percent, and a manual recount is ordered if the margin is less than 0.25 percent. The governor\u2019s race probably will not meet the manual recount standard, if Saturday\u2019s tally holds.\n\nStill, the news prompted Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, to reverse his decision to concede to the former congressman.\n\n\u201cLet me say clearly: I am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call that we count every single vote,\u201d Gillum said at his campaign office Saturday afternoon.\n\nGillum said he was dispatching hundreds of volunteers and lawyers across the state to make sure the count is fair and accurate. The outcome of the election, Gillum said, \u201cwill have consequences beyond who wins and who loses. How we handle this election and this process will have reverberations for democracy for an entire generation of voters.\u201d\n\nA manual recount is of ballots in which voters skipped a race or voted for two candidates in one race. That pool of ballots will be in the tens of thousands in heavily Democratic Broward County, where nearly 25,000 ballots showed votes for governor but not senator.\n\nThose ballots represent Nelson\u2019s best chance to close the gap with Scott \u2014 if the machines failed to detect actual votes. But it\u2019s possible that voters skipped the race, purposefully or by mistake. The culprit could have been the design of the ballot, in which the Senate candidates appeared in the bottom left corner, under the voting instructions.\n\nIn Broward and Palm Beach counties Saturday morning, attorneys from both parties quibbled over ballots in which the intent or eligibility of the voter was in doubt as the minutes ticked toward a noon deadline for counties to submit unofficial vote totals to the state. Scott\u2019s narrowing lead as vote-counting continued after Election Day has provoked litigation and raucous street protests reminiscent of the contentious 2000 election.\n\nIn a sign of the heated battles to come, the three-member Broward County Canvassing Board on Saturday slogged through one ballot at a time, trying to determine if each voter was eligible and which candidates were favored \u2014 while fielding arguments from Democratic and Republican attorneys. Journalists and onlookers were on hand to observe the spectacle.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of grandstanding going on,\u201d said Anthony Quackenbush, an attorney for Nelson\u2019s campaign, cracking a joke about the speeches elections officials and attorneys gave as they litigated each ballot. \u201cI figured I\u2019d make a competition out of it.\u201d\n\nWilliam Scherer, a Republican attorney representing Scott, held an impromptu news conference in the back of the room during a break to discuss his objections to 205 mail-in ballots that election workers had improperly opened. \u201cFake news, fake news!\u201d and \u201cLiar, liar!\u201d some people in the crowd of about 100 people shouted. Another popular chant: \u201cCount every vote!\u201d\n\nThe battle is also playing out on a national level, as the Scott campaign arranged for Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) to complain about the vote-counting in a call with reporters. He compared the situation in Florida to the contentious confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\nGraham encouraged Scott to report to Washington in the coming week for orientation for new senators, regardless of the recount. \u201cIf the recount goes, the recount goes,\u201d Graham said.\n\nScott campaign manager Jackie Schutz Zeckman said the governor\u2019s team was still working on his schedule.\n\n\n\nSullivan reported from Tallahassee.", "CAIRO \u2014 The information minister of Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government says his counterpart in the rebel administration has fled the country and defected to neighboring Saudi Arabia.\n\nMoammer al-Iryani told The Associated Press Saturday that his rebel counterpart, Abdul-Salam Ali Gaber, arrived in Saudi Arabia with his family after they fled Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, which has been under rebel control since 2014.\n\nGaber is the most senior member of the Houthi administration to defect since civil war broke out in 2014, dealing a blow to the rebels\u2019 image as they battle an offensive by a Saudi-led coalition to retake the key Red Sea port city of Hodeida.\n\nThe coalition has been fighting the Houthis on the side of the government and its allies since 2015.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Bilal Hussein/Associated Press)\n\nBEIRUT \u2014 The head of Lebanon\u2019s militant group Hezbollah said his group will not be compelled by threats or sanctions to give up its rocket a capability, urging his government in comments Saturday to contend with the diplomatic pressure it faces.\n\nHassan Nasrallah said succumbing to diplomatic pressure would allow Israel to attack Lebanon at will.\n\nNasrallah spoke to supporters in Beirut\u2019s southern district via video link on \u201cMartyrs\u2019 Day,\u201d commemorating the group\u2019s fighters in combat.\n\n\u201cToday, on martyr\u2019s day, I want to reaffirm that we are holding on to the strength of Lebanon, which lies in the golden equation: the army, the people and the resistance.

But with Trump sounding off in a misleading Twitter post about what he called Macron\u2019s \u201cvery insulting\u201d proposal for a European army, all eyes are now on the future of their relationship. Can the bromance survive?\n\nHere\u2019s a timeline of a relationship on the rocks:\n\nMay 2017: The handshake\n\nThis was when Trump and Macron first met, at a NATO gathering in Brussels. Shortly after Macron\u2019s election earlier that month, it was the young French president\u2019s formal introduction to his counterparts from around the North Atlantic world. And his handshake with Trump was a notable event, the one that stole the headlines. The two leaders were locked in a lengthy awkward grip. As The Washington Post\u2019s Philip Rucker wrote at the time: \u201cThe two men shook hands for six long seconds. Their knuckles turned white, their jaws clenched and their faces tightened. Trump reached in first, but then he tried to release, twice, but Macron kept his grip until letting go.\u201d\n\nJune 2017: The needling period\n\nStanding in the rose garden of the White House, Trump announced that he would be withdrawing the United States from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, signed by President Barack Obama and nearly every other world leader in December 2015. He justified his decision in terms of his belief in \u201cAmerica First,\u201d saying he was elected to \u201crepresent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris\u201d \u2014 remarks that Pittsburgh\u2019s mayor promptly rejected.\n\nMacron, however, poked a little fun at his American counterpart, inviting American climate scientists to continue their research in France and declaring, in perfect English, \u201cMake our planet great again.\u201d It was an obvious play on Trump\u2019s campaign slogan: \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\n\nJuly 2017: The honeymoon\n\nWelcome to the height of the honeymoon period.\n\nTrump flew to Paris for Bastille Day, France\u2019s national holiday. This was the height of the honeymoon period. \u201cFrance is America\u2019s first and oldest ally. A lot of people don\u2019t know that,\u201d Trump declared during a bilateral news conference at the Elysee Palace. \u201cIt was a long time ago, but we are together. And I think together, perhaps, more so than ever. The relationship is very good.\u201d\n\nTrump also famously complimented Macron\u2019s wife, Brigitte Macron, on her appearance, telling the French first lady that she was \u201cin such good shape.\u201d Trump and Macron also shared another extended handshake, and Trump adored the military parade on the Champs-Elysees.\n\nApril 2018: The moment of truth\n\nSo. Much. Touching.\n\nDuring Macron\u2019s state visit to Washington, Trump greeted his guest with lots of physical contact. At the beginning of the encounter, Trump appeared to flick a piece of what he called dandruff off Macron\u2019s pristine lapel, and a joint news conference in the White House East Room was marked by French-style pecking kisses.\n\nBut things began to go downhill from there: Despite Macron\u2019s repeated entreaties to preserve the Iran deal, the signature foreign policy achievement of the Obama administration, Trump ultimately pulled out of the agreement, much to Europe\u2019s chagrin. Macron came back to Paris empty-handed.\n\nNovember 2018: The beginning of the end?\n\nAs Air Force One arrived in Paris, Trump took to Twitter to lambaste Macron for \u2014 what Trump said at least \u2014 was a plan to create a European army that would protect France from the United States, Russia and China. \u201cVery insulting,\u201d Trump tweeted. In fact, that wasn\u2019t what Macron had proposed, and Trump had taken remarks Macron made during a radio interview earlier in the week out of context, as had several media reports.\n\nThe Elysee Palace worked to patch things up as quickly as possible and to show Trump that what Macron said was really a version of what he has been saying all along, which is that Europe needs to take more charge of its own defenses. \u201cI appreciate what you\u2019re saying about burden-sharing,\u201d Trump said Saturday. \u201cWe want to help Europe, but it has to be fair. \u2026 We want to absolutely be there, we want to help, we want to be a part of it, but different countries have to help.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018Real low energy\u2019: Critics pile on after Trump cancels visit to U.S. military cemetery outside Paris\n\nWhile commemorating WWI, Macron auditions to be the leader of Europe", "\n\nJeff Sessions testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nWhen President Trump said he wanted former senator Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) to head his Justice Department, liberal lawmakers and activists warned that his appointment would be detrimental for civil rights, specifically when it comes to issues impacting black people.\n\nA lot of what they were worried about came to pass in the less than two years he was in the position. Sessions made significant efforts to roll back decisions made by the Obama administration in the area of policing law enforcement and protecting civil rights.\n\nNot long after Trump\u2019s inauguration, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) told Washington Post opinion columnist Jonathan Capehart that she believed Sessions was \u201cvery dangerous\u201d for people of color.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s a racist, I think he\u2019s a throwback and I don\u2019t mind saying it, any day of the week,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that Jeff Sessions is very dangerous \u2026 and I think that he absolutely believes that it\u2019s his job to keep minorities in their place. And so I think we have to watch him, we have to keep an eye on him, and be prepared to push back.\u201d\n\nAnd Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) made headlines for opposing Sessions\u2019s nomination by attempting to read a 1986 letter critical of the former lawmaker.\n\n\u201cI am surprised that the words of Coretta Scott King are not suitable for debate in the United States Senate,\u201d Warren said after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell interrupted her speech.\n\nWaters likely felt that way in part because Sessions allegedly accused the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and other civil rights organizations of being un-American when dealing with civil rights issues. And former colleagues testified that he used the n-word and joked about the Ku Klux Klan, saying he thought the terrorist organization was \u201cokay, until he learned that they smoked marijuana.\u201d Sessions denies that he made those comments.\n\nUnder Sessions\u2019s leadership, the Justice Department has rolled back efforts to investigate police departments before releasing public reports about their failings \u2014 a practice put in place during the Obama administration after activists complained about law enforcement\u2019s bias against people of color.\n\nAnd Sessions and his staff were criticized by members of Congress after the FBI\u2019s Counterterrorism Division, an investigative unit that focuses on threats from terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda, created a new label for domestic terrorist groups \u2014 \u201cBlack Identity Extremists\u201d (BIEs) \u2014 just before the violent march and protest in Charlottesville drew more attention to white supremacy in America.\n\nSessions\u2019s move to enforce federal marijuana laws were viewed as an attempt to revive the failed war on drugs, something historians say disproportionately harmed people of color. A directive made it easier for American prosecutors to enforce federal marijuana laws in states where the substance is legal, such as California.\n\nAnd during the latter years of the Obama presidency as police shootings of men of color gained national attention, the Justice Department put systems in place to hold law enforcement more accountable for their actions.\n\nBut shortly before being fired, Sessions made sure his last action was consistent with so many of his others while in the Trump administration. On Wednesday morning, he signed a memorandum making decrees used during the Obama era to fight abuse by police more difficult to enact.\n\nSessions will be remembered for many things \u2014 being the first lawmaker to affirm Trumpism is one of them, but to many liberal lawmakers, his legacy will be backing policies that disproportionately negatively affected people of color.", "President Trump on Saturday named seven individuals who will receive the highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, next week \u2014 a list that includes a GOP mega-donor.\n\nThe awardees are retiring Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), sports legendaries Babe Ruth and Roger Staubach, musician Elvis Presley, the late Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, former Minnesota Supreme Court justice Alan C. Page, and Miriam Adelson, a physician and wife of Sheldon Adelson, a billionaire casino magnate.\n\nIn its news release, the White House cited Adelson\u2019s research in narcotic addiction, her founding of two centers to fight substance abuse and her support of Jewish organizations. The release does not mention that the Adelsons also contributed at least $87 million to GOP candidates in the 2018 midterms. This included $25 million given to the Senate Leadership Fund, a Super PAC aimed at supporting and electing GOP candidates into the House of Representatives.\n\n\n\nIn this May 13, 2008 file photo, Sheldon Adelson, CEO of the Las Vegas Sands Corp., left, sits with his wife Dr. Miriam Adelson before a session at the President's Conference in Jerusalem. (AP Photo/Tara Todras-Whitehill, File)\n\nThe award, established 50 years ago by President John F. Kennedy, is bestowed to individuals \u201cwho have made especially meritorious contributions to the security of national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors,\u201d according to a release by the White House. Past awardees have included a mix of more than 500 celebrities, musicians, politicians and philanthropists.\n\nAdelson\u2019s selection, however, raised some questions about her qualifications for the award and also whether the White House was rewarding a donor.\n\nTrump is giving the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor he can give, to Sheldon Adelson\u2019s wife Miriam. He\u2019s counting on Adelson money to support his 2020 re-election bid. Is handing out honors like this worse than letting donors stay in the Lincoln Bedroom? \u2014 James Hohmann (@jameshohmann) November 10, 2018\n\nYes, giving the Presidential Medal of Freedom as a thank you to mega donors is reprehensible. https://t.co/gWQbvxu14J \u2014 Timothy Yost (@MrYost1) November 10, 2018\n\nThe Medal of Freedom is this country's highest civilian honor. So tell me how does Miriam Adelson, the wife of Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson, qualify? https://t.co/8kiBrOWQPR \u2014 Mae T. (@mspoint1106) November 10, 2018\n\nHas the Presidential Medal of Freedom ever previously gone to someone just for being a big donor? https://t.co/IsiHbqfGc2 \u2014 Jeet Heer (@HeerJeet) November 10, 2018\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to questions about criticism of Adelson\u2019s selection.\n\nHatch, meanwhile, who announced he plans to retire at the end of this year, is the longest-serving Republican senator in the history of the United States, having been a chamber member since 1977. He has been the chairman of several key committees, including the Judiciary and Finance committees, and is currently the president pro tempore of the Senate, making him third in line of succession to the presidency.\n\nPresley was a cultural icon of the 20th century, a star of both music and film. Though known as the \u201cKing of Rock and Roll,\u201d he was singer whose repertoire included blues, country, pop and gospel. The best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music, he received multiple accolades, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He died in 1977.\n\nRuth, known as \u201cThe Sultan of Swat,\u201d held the Major League Baseball\u2019s home run record, 714, until Hank Aaron surpassed it in 1974. He was one of the first five inductees in the Baseball Hall of Fame. The New York Yankees legend died in 1948.\n\nStaubach was an all-star quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys, leading the NFL team to the Super Bowl five times, while winning two. Before going pro, he attended the U.S. Naval Academy, where he won the Heisman Trophy, and did a tour of duty in the Vietnam War. He is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nPage, who also played in the NFL, was the first black Supreme Court justice in Minnesota. A member of the Minnesota Viking\u2019s \u201cPurple People Eaters,\u201d Page is considered one of the best defensive linemen to play the game, and is a member of both the pro and college football halls of fame. A graduate of the University of Minnesota law school, Page was elected to the state\u2019s highest court in 1992. He retired in 2015.\n\nScalia served on the nation\u2019s highest court from 1986 until his death in 2016. A staunch conservative, Scalia advocated originalism in interpreting the Constitution and opposed the right to abortion and same sex marriage. He is well-remembered for his strongly-worded minority opinion in several key court decisions.\n\nThis is not the first time a Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient sparked controversy. There are no explicit rules regarding the selection process, and the President ultimately makes the final call, The Post\u2019s Juliet Eilperin reported. Barack Obama, for example, gave the award to Mary Robinson, a former Irish president who advocated for human and women\u2019s rights \u2014 which upset some U.S. Jewish leaders who felt she\u2019d been too critical of Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians.\n\nThe medals will be awarded on Nov. 16.", "College professor Jeff McClenahan hiked up a winding road Saturday toward a terrible unknown, expecting the worst.\n\nThe ferocious Woolsey Fire had come through Friday after leaping the freeway. McClenahan had grabbed his wife\u2019s computer and some documents and fled. That night, someone had posted a photo on social media of a nearby house consumed by the flames. He had stayed awake all night, thinking: \u201cI\u2019ll never wear that cowboy hat again. I\u2019ll never wear that sweater again.\u201d\n\nBut fires can be capricious. Maybe he still had his home?\n\nHe arrived, and stared. A house that has succumbed to a wildfire is rarely just a little bit destroyed. The damage almost always looks as if the structure had not merely been burned, but also bombed. A water pipe spurted halfheartedly over the ruins.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand . . . it\u2019s stuff,\u201d McClenahan said, struggling to maintain his composure. \u201cBut it\u2019s a lot of history. Everything, our whole lives were in here.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you get to start over,\u201d he said. Then he crumbled to his knees and sobbed.\n\n[The weather and climate behind the infernos that wrecked Paradise and threaten Malibu]\n\nThe wildfires scorching California in the past few days have been vast, bringing their destruction and lethality to numerous communities across large swaths of the state, including this one in Los Angeles County and another gigantic burn along the northern mountains.\n\nThe Camp Fire, in the Sierra Nevada foothills north of Sacramento, is now the most destructive individual wildfire in California\u2019s history. As of Saturday, it already had destroyed nearly 7,000 structures in and around the mountain town of Paradise and has been blamed for 23 of the 25 overall deaths, though more could come.\n\n\u201cThis event was the worst-case scenario,\u201d Butte County Sheriff Kory L. Honea said. \u201cIt\u2019s the event that we have feared for a long time.\u201d\n\nHonea said Saturday night that 14 additional bodies were found, bringing the death toll in the Northern California fire to 23, the Associated Press reported. The victims have not been identified. He said there are reports of about 110 people missing.\n\nThe smoke, like orange fog, that enveloped Chico and surrounding towns Friday gave way to a low-lying haze that spread all the way up to Redding on Saturday, thanks to a shift in winds overnight.\n\n[Pepperdine students sheltered in place as wildfire raged around the Malibu campus]\n\nSurgical nurse Nichole Jolly, who turned 34 on Friday, spent her birthday helping evacuate the patients from Paradise\u2019s only hospital. She didn\u2019t know whether her home survived. After the hospital had been cleared, she tried to leave the area but was trapped by smoke and flames. Her car caught fire. A call from her husband, in a place where cellphone service is notoriously spotty, came through, and \u201che told me to get out and run.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told him I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to make it out,\u201d she said. \u201cI told him I loved him and told him to give the kids a kiss. He told me to get out of the car and run, that if you\u2019re going to die, die fighting.\u201d\n\nA bulldozer operator picked her up and took her back to the Feather River Hospital, where staffers, trapped in place, started a triage area outside because \u201cthe whole place smelled like burned plastic.\u201d\n\nStaff members, patients and anyone who could hold a fire extinguisher watched for spot fires. She said about 10 nurses, two doctors and a respiratory therapist spent the next five or six hours treating anyone who reached the hospital.\n\n\u201cPeople were making sure no one was left behind,\u201d she said. \u201cStrangers helping strangers. We might be a divided country, but it didn\u2019t matter that day. Black, white, Democrat, Republican; none of that mattered. People just helped one another, and it was amazing to see.\u201d\n\nHere in Southern California, authorities said two bodies were found, both burned, in Malibu in a vehicle that had been in the path of the wildfire, though homicide investigators are still working that case and have not officially declared a cause of death. Winds eased Saturday, but they are expected to increase again Sunday. The weather \u2014 dry air, high winds and no rain \u2014 is conducive to fires and is forecast to continue until late Tuesday.\n\nAbout 200,000 people were displaced by the Woolsey Fire, which began midafternoon Thursday near Simi Valley, even as fire departments were responding to a second wildfire, called the Hill Fire, just west of Thousand Oaks. The Woolsey Fire proved to be explosive, expanding within 24 hours to some 35,000 acres. It raced from the Conejo Valley to the Pacific Ocean, across Highway 101 and the Santa Monica mountains, at speeds that impressed veteran fire officials.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s spreading quicker than it used to,\u201d said Mark Lorenzen, chief of the Ventura County Fire Department.\n\nThey weren\u2019t surprised. They knew the wind was coming, and when there is strong wind here, there is fire, reliably. But David Richardson, deputy chief of the Los Angeles County Fire Department, said everyone had expected a lull in the wind Friday afternoon, and it didn\u2019t materialize. The gusts stayed dangerous.\n\n\u201cThis fire is very bad and monumental.

Her two-story wooden house somehow was spared, with a trail of fire skirting it along the property line. The only things she lost were a couple of garbage cans. She\u2019d won the fire lottery.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still completely dazed,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been crying for 20 hours.\u201d She surveyed the remnants of the neighborhood with Jeremy Sugarman, 39, a landscape architect whose home also survived.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very familiar with fire.

He recounted driving to Malibu to check on his mother\u2019s house. \u201cWe were seeing smoke tornadoes.\u201d\n\nIn Malibu, Pepperdine University\u2019s 3,600 undergraduates were ordered to shelter in place as the fire approached. That decision by university officials proved controversial, especially with parents, after the flames reached hillsides near campus. Overnight, debate had raged about whether the students were in the safest possible spot \u2014 or trapped and in danger.\n\nIt seems counterintuitive, said Connie Horton, vice president for student affairs, but the Los Angeles County Fire Department supports the shelter-in-place plan as the safest course. \u201cWe have lived it a number of times over the years, practiced it, rehearsed it, trained on it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe flames had been extinguished near campus by early Saturday morning.\n\nOn Saturday, President Trump made his first comments on the wildfires, alleging mismanagement of the forests.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor,\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday morning. \u201cBillions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests.

(Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPARIS \u2014 For the second time, President Trump has repeated the false claim that French President Emmanuel Macron called for a European army to protect the continent against the United States. Macron never said any such thing.\n\n\u201cEmmanuel Macron suggests building its [sic] own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday morning. \u201cBut it was Germany in World Wars One & Two - How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along. Pay for NATO or not!\u201d\n\nThe remark came on a particularly solemn day in France, the three-year anniversary of the Nov. 13 Paris attacks, in which 130 people were killed in a coordinated assault by terrorists affiliated with the Islamic State. It was the bloodiest attack on French soil since World War II.\n\nTuesday\u2019s comment echoed Trump\u2019s earlier statement, which he made as Air Force One was arriving in France on Friday evening:\n\n\u201cPresident Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nPresident Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2018\n\nTrump\u2019s interpretation of Macron\u2019s remarks is factually misleading and comes from an interview Macron gave to France\u2019s Europe 1 radio several days before Trump\u2019s arrival. What Macron said has been largely echoed by European Union leaders for months now and in fact mimics the same demand Trump has long made: Europe needs to stop relying on the United States for its own defense.\n\n\u201cI believe in the project of a sovereign Europe. We won\u2019t protect Europe if we don\u2019t decide to have a true European army. In front of Russia, which is at our borders and which can be threatening, I would like to start a security dialogue with Russia, which is a country I respect and which is European,\u201d Macron told Europe 1.\n\n\u201cWe have to have a Europe that can defend itself alone \u2014 and without only relying on the United States \u2014 in a more sovereign manner,\u201d he added.\n\nMacron\u2019s demands for a European army were met with skepticism across Europe this week, but not for the same reasons to which Trump objected. Though some E.U. members have multinational brigades or share equipment to save costs, European national constitutions fundamentally differ on the circumstances of military operations. Germany\u2019s post-World War II constitution, for instance, has restricted military operations far more than is the case in contemporary Britain or France, countries that have participated in U.S. strikes against Syria\u2019s Assad regime after a chemical weapons attack this year. German forces, however, would have been unable to intervene for constitutional reasons.\n\nWhile demands for a European army are unlikely to move ahead anytime soon given those challenges, Macron\u2019s broader point that Europe needs to become less dependent on the United States is not new. Last summer, German Chancellor Angela Merkel similarly said Europe \u201creally must take our fate into our own hands,\u201d even though she was not explicitly discussing military issues.\n\nMerkel said Europe\u2019s move toward self-reliance should be carried out \u201cof course in friendship with the United States of America, in friendship with Great Britain and as good neighbors wherever that works.\u201d Germany, for instance, hosts some of the biggest U.S. military bases outside the United States and has no intention of forcing them out.\n\nLike Merkel, Macron has repeatedly emphasized Europe\u2019s willingness to cooperate with the United States under Trump, even as those ties are under mounting pressure.\n\nRushing to Trump\u2019s defense on social media, some pointed to another Macron quote in the same interview this week. Europe has to protect itself \u201cwith respect to China, Russia and even the United States,\u201d he said. But in that portion of his radio interview, Macron was actually referring to cybersecurity matters and fading multilateralism. Trump essentially combined two parts of the same interview, which was initially mistranslated in some English-language reports.\n\nThere has been some scrutiny of U.S. cybersecurity operations in Europe for years, especially after it was revealed in 2014 that the National Security Agency intercepted calls by Merkel and had access to sensitive communications. From a European perspective, not protecting itself from possible U.S. spying operations would appear rather naive, given those disclosures.\n\nIn any case, this has been a difficult week for Macron in comments made to journalists. The ambiguities of his statements have dominated the headlines.\n\nSpeaking to reporters during one of the World War I commemoration events, the French president launched a bitter national debate on Wednesday by declaring that Philippe P\u00e9tain, the leader of France\u2019s infamous Vichy government during World War II, was a \u201cgreat soldier\u201d in World War I and that it was \u201clegitimate\u201d to honor marshals like him. Following outrage from Jewish groups and public commentators, the Elysee Palace was forced on the defensive, insisting there would be no formal commemoration of P\u00e9tain.\n\nWith his remarks on U.S.-European ties this week, however, Macron is far from being the only leader in Europe who has blamed the United States for some of the fading multilateralism in recent years. Trump has threatened the E.U. with tariffs, withdrawn from an Iran deal Europe says it will uphold and repeatedly raised questions over the future of NATO \u2014 pledges that have drawn the ire of capitals across the continent.\n\nMacron\u2019s comments reflected that divide, but there\u2019s no reason the United States should be worried about a looming European invasion.\n\nThis article was originally published on Nov. 10 and then updated on Nov. 13 to reflect the president\u2019s additional tweets on the subject.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump and Macron meet amid tensions over Macron\u2019s military comments\n\nWhile commemorating WWI, Macron auditions to be the leader of Europe", "\n\nPresident Trump points at American Urban Radio Networks White House correspondent April Ryan during a news conference following Tuesday's midterm elections.

What a stupid question. But I watch you a lot, you ask a lot of stupid questions.\u201d Wednesday at the White House, he told me to \u201csit down.\u201d In Friday\u2019s press gaggle, he called me \u201cnasty\u201d and a \u201closer,\u201d never mind my 21 years spent covering four presidents as a reporter for American Urban Radio Networks.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to find the common denominator: Though there\u2019s hardly anyone \u2014 from his predecessors to senators in his own party \u2014 he won\u2019t try to shout down with ad hominem insults, Trump relishes, and injects venom into, verbal attacks against women of color.\n\nHe leaves little doubt about what he really thinks of us.\n\nIn rally after rally, when Trump says Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) has a \u201clow I.Q.\u201d he\u2019s showing contempt for the idea that a black woman, who has sworn an oath to uphold the same Constitution as he has, should be able to speak her mind if she in any way challenges his authority. When he feuded with Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) over his response to the death of her constituent, La David Johnson, an African American Army sergeant killed in action, he failed to live up to his role as commander in chief. When he says Stacey Abrams, a Yale Law School graduate and former Democratic leader of the Georgia House of Representatives, is \u201cnot qualified\u201d to be her state\u2019s governor, he\u2019s applying a double standard. When he feuded, via Twitter, with Jemele Hill, the National Association of Black Journalists\u2019 2018 journalist of the year (an award I was honored with in 2017) Trump telegraphed that there\u2019s something about being questioned by a black woman that he can\u2019t abide. One or two of these instances might only leave you scratching your head. But we\u2019ve reached the point where it\u2019s an unmistakable pattern.\n\n[I represented La David Johnson. Here's what I still want to know about his death.]\n\nThe journalists covering Trump\u2019s presidency are professionals, and I\u2019m confident that all of us, including the African American women covering this White House, will continue to do our jobs no matter how we\u2019re treated by President Trump. But we shouldn\u2019t have to put up with the kind of treatment we received this week: Not only has the president given cover to people who want to harass us, but he\u2019s left the American people with a twisted understanding of how press freedoms work. He seems not to appreciate that journalists\u2019 roles are to hold power to account, and, at times, seems unwilling to face tough questions. At the end of my exchange with him at the most recent White House news conference \u2014 the type of exchange that I\u2019ve had, completely respectfully, with other presidents \u2014 he implied that my White House hard pass, the credential that allows me White House access daily, might be pulled. That\u2019s not how things are supposed to work in a democracy.\n\nAnd the taunting, schoolyard-bully atmosphere winds up putting a stain on the highest office in the land. The White House is where decisions about war and peace, taxes and spending, and fundamental human rights are made \u2014 a place where life or death can be determined by the stroke of a pen. The presidency is the one office that\u2019s supposed to represent everyone, no matter their faith, race, gender or orientation.\n\nCorrespondents don\u2019t go to the White House every day to make friends. We do our jobs courteously, but also thoroughly and assertively, to get answers for our viewers, listeners and readers about the statements and actions that affect all Americans\u2019 lives. Sometimes that means having a quiet sidebar with a member of the White House communications staff. Sometimes that means meeting with first son-in-law and presidential adviser Jared Kushner to discuss the administration\u2019s approach to criminal justice reform. Sometimes that means shouting a question at the president as he crosses the White House lawn on the way to boarding Marine One. You can tell, though, by the way Trump has responded in recent days to more than one black female journalist that he sees our presence there as illegitimate. If he didn\u2019t, he\u2019d either answer our questions or simply ignore them, not berate us.\n\nBut when Trump denigrates black women, he\u2019s sending the message that he doesn\u2019t see us equally.\n\nEvery morning that I walk through the White House gates, I thank God for the privilege of doing the job that I do, and for the trust and faith that my listeners put in me to ask for, and bring home, the truth. Every day, I try to remember that, to the best of my knowledge of my family\u2019s history, I am only five generations removed from the last known member of my family to be enslaved, Joseph Dollar Brown, who was sold on the auction block in North Carolina. And I carry that knowledge with me, because I owe it to him to cover the presidency the best way I know how, no matter how much pushback I get.\n\nThe White House has had issues with me ever since January, when I asked, \u201cMr. President, are you a racist?\u201d After his response to Charlottesville, after \u201cs---hole countries,\u201d after \u201cget that son of a b---- off the field\u201d and \u201cWhat the hell do you have to lose?\u201d it\u2019s more than a fair question, it\u2019s necessary.

Symptoms include typical signs of depression \u2014 such as low energy, sleep problems, changes in appetite and weight, and loss of interest in favorite activities. But with SAD, symptoms come and go with the season. No one knows what causes SAD, but most experts link its development to less exposure to the sun\u2019s rays, brought about by shorter days in the fall and winter.

They were bound for Quer\u00e9taro state. The bulk of the caravan delayed its departure from the capital until Saturday. (Alfredo Estrella/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe migrant caravan began another leg toward the U.S. border on Saturday, continuing the journey north from Mexico City a day after the Trump administration moved to restrict asylum options for unauthorized immigrants. The group waited in the capital for almost a week, hearing snippets of information about the militarization of the border and the U.S. midterm elections.\n\nMembers of the caravan appeared undeterred, affirming that returning to their home countries was not feasible. They boarded the subway before dawn to reach the outskirts of the Mexican capital.\n\nThe most pressing question: How long would it take to travel the 1,700 miles to Tijuana, on the border with California? Many vowed they would eventually cross into the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s new measures , which were announced Thursday, deny asylum to people who enter the United States between official ports of entry. Those arrivals can seek lesser status known as \u201cwithholding of removal\u201d or protection under the Convention Against Torture. Either would temporarily prevent them from being deported but provides no path to permanent legal status.\n\nAll those who enter via official ports of entry will be able to seek asylum, and many caravan members say that\u2019s their plan.\n\n[Trump issues decree limiting asylum protection for migrants crossing illegally into the U.S.]\n\n\u201cIf God wants it, we\u2019re going to ask for political asylum on the border,\u201d said Lourdes Martinez, 25, from La Ceiba, a coastal city in Honduras. She said she did not foresee problems since she would not be breaking the law. \u201cI\u2019m headed to one of the bridges, not crossing the river or anything like that.\u201d\n\nShe was convinced she had a shot at making it to the United States, along with her husband and their 4-year-old daughter, because they were fleeing forced recruitment by the MS-13 gang in their hometown. Even when U.S. lawyers volunteering in Mexico warned the family could be detained for more than a year during asylum proceedings, she was not dissuaded.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and other civil rights groups filed a lawsuit challenging the presidential proclamation hours before it took effect on Saturday. Trump\u2019s decree remained a concern among the lawyers, wearing orange fluorescent hats, who stood out from the crowd of migrants. Twenty of the lawyers walked around offering 10-minute summaries about asylum to migrants sprawled on the bleachers and in plastic tents in a sports stadium in Mexico City where they slept.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand their rights as asylum seekers, or refugees, even when they have strong asylum claims,\u201d said Arturo Viscarra, a member of the U.S.-based National Lawyers Guild. He noted Central Americans have been crossing the U.S. border for decades.\n\n[Why migrant families are seeking asylum at the border in record numbers]\n\nBut now, Viscarra said, \u201cthey have incredible wait times at ports of entry\u201d \u2014 a situation that is only likely to get worse when the caravan reaches the border. Already, forced waits at official crossing points that can be weeks long have led people to cross illegally. Viscarra said he had documented cases in the border city of Reynosa in which migrants with asylum claims were turned away at bridges, then crossed between ports of entry, only to request asylum from U.S. authorities after they were detained.\n\nThat will be impossible under the new rules, at least for the next 90 days.\n\n\n\nTemporary shelters are set up for the migrant caravan at Mexico City\u2019s sprawling Sports City complex. (Alfredo Estrella/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSome members of the caravan didn\u2019t want to hear such dispiriting news. Sofia Sanchez, 40, from Cofrad\u00eda, Honduras, who was traveling with her nephews, said she was more focused on the unity of the caravan than on hypothetical problems.\n\n\u201cThey bring our morale down by telling us families could be separated,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI believe that God will help us, and we want to reach the other side of the border.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s move applies to anyone who crosses the border without documents, but it has been seen as a preemptive step against the caravan, which has provoked the president\u2019s ire since it left Honduras in mid-October. A previous caravan in the spring also traveled to Tijuana, where 401 people eventually sought asylum. But the administration reported it had also apprehended alleged caravan members who crossed illegally.\n\nRodrigo Abeja, a member of the activist collective Pueblo Sin Fronteras, which has been helping coordinate the caravan, said single men seeking work were most likely to attempt to cross between ports of entry, while others \u2014 entire families, women with children, unaccompanied minors or LGBTQ migrants \u2014 would be more likely to seek asylum.\n\nAlthough many remained uncertain about what decision they would make at the border, he said, they were no longer willing to sit and debate in the sports stadium in Mexico City.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t have a reason to wait here anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people want to reach the border, where they can then wait and get ready, but with the help of their family networks.\u201d\n\nMigrants who receive financial support from relatives in the United States at times do not cross immediately, but instead save up to pay a smuggler or prepare evidence for their asylum applications. Others decide to stay in northern cities in Mexico.\n\nOn Thursday, the marchers had held a late-night vote to determine their final destination. Many gathered around a map provided by the American Red Cross that showed the traditional routes to the border. A couple of the routes stretched toward Texas, to cities such as Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and Reynosa, while another veered off toward Tijuana. The crowd selected Tijuana, although it was farther than any other city with a port of entry, because it was considered safer and the route there allowed them to avoid territory dominated by cartels.\n\nThe migrants traced the train lines on the map with their fingers, attempting to measure the distances.

(Yves Herman/Reuters)\n\nWorld War I had lasted more than four years, pitting Germany and its allies against France, Britain, Russia and their allies. The United States entered the war late but played a crucial role in the victory.\n\nIt had started over the assassination of an Austrian archduke in 1914 and rapidly pulled in Europe\u2019s major powers via a tangle of alliances, and a certain eagerness to be tested in war. \u201cGod be thanked Who has matched us with His hour,\u201d the British poet Rupert Brooke wrote in 1914.\n\nBattles went on for months, trapping the combatants in what historian Paul Fussell called a \u201ctroglodyte world\u201d of squalid trenches and endless artillery barrages.\n\nIn his book \u201cThe Great War and Modern Memory,\u201d Fussell calculated that there were 25,000 miles of trench lines on the Western Front, enough to encircle the earth.\n\nBetween the trenches was the toxic, uninhabitable \u201cno man\u2019s land,\u201d infected with putrefying corpses, rats and chemical agents, and swept by machine-gun fire.\n\n[Letters from War]\n\nIn such conditions, the British and French fought the Germans at the Battle of the Somme from July 1, 1916, until the following November. On just the first day, almost 20,000 British soldiers were killed.\n\nAt the Battle of Verdun, the Germans fought the French for nine months in 1916. The Germans suffered 325,000 casualties, including more than 140,000 men killed. French losses were about the same.\n\nIn the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, the Americans and the French fought the Germans for six weeks in 1918. Twenty-six thousand Americans were killed \u2014 the most of any battle in American history.\n\nSome soldiers, called \u201cNeverendians,\u201d thought the war would go on forever and become \u201cthe permanent condition of mankind,\u201d Fussell wrote, \u201clike the telephone and the internal combustion engine, a part of the accepted atmosphere of the modern experience.\u201d\n\nGermany\u2019s downfall\n\nOn Nov. 9, 1918, two German generals went to a stately mansion outside the Belgian town of Spa to call on the 59-year-old German emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm II.\n\nThe army was collapsing, the Kaiser was told. Armistice terms demanded by the Allies must be accepted. The war had been a disaster for Germany. Back home, the people were in revolt.\n\nThe kaiser, who bore much of the blame for fueling the war, objected.\n\n\u201cI shall remain at Spa, and then lead my troops back to Germany,\u201d he replied, according to historian Joseph E. Persico.\n\n\u201cSire, you no longer have an army,\u201d said Chief of Staff Gen. Wilhelm Groener.\n\nThe kaiser agreed to abdicate and seek refuge in Holland. But as he was pondering a draft of his statement renouncing the throne, a German telegraph agency, tipped to what was coming, broke the news: The kaiser was finished.\n\n\u201cTreason, gentlemen!\u201d the kaiser bellowed when he heard of the report. \u201cBarefaced, outrageous treason!\u201d\n\nThe last death\n\nThe armistice was signed at 5:10 a.m. in a railroad car in the Forest of Compiegne, northeast of Paris, an event described in Persico\u2019s 2004 book, \u201cEleventh Month, Eleventh Day, Eleventh Hour.\u201d\n\nBut it didn\u2019t go into effect until 11 a.m.\n\nAll the soldiers had to do was stay alive until then.\n\n\u201cI am as nervous as a kitten,\u201d the British sergeant Cude wrote. \u201cIf I can only last out the remainder of the time, and this is everyone\u2019s prayer. I am awfully sorry for those of our chaps who are killed this morning and there must be a decent few of them too.\u201d\n\nIndeed, in some places the war went on insanely right up to 11 a.m.\n\n\n\nTroops of the 64th Infantry Brigade, 32nd Division, advancing while in support of the first line.

Gen. William J. Nicholson, had ordered \u201cno let up\u201d until 11.\n\nAt that moment, Henry N. Gunther, a draftee from East Baltimore, was pinned down in the fog by two German machine guns. Gunther had been an employee of the National Bank of Baltimore. But he was of German descent, had relatives in Germany, and worried that his comrades thought he was a sympathizer, according to Persico and old newspaper stories.\n\nHe tried to prove he wasn\u2019t by an almost reckless action, his fellow Doughboys said later.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t see them, but we hugged the ground and sent a lot of rifle fire in the direction of the position,\u201d Gunther\u2019s buddy Ernest F. Powell recalled of the moment many years later.\n\n\u201cGunther, who was lying by my side, suddenly jumped up and ran into the fog toward the Germans,\u201d Powell wrote in the Baltimore Sun Magazine in 1968.\n\nA 1919 report in the Sun, gathered from Gunther\u2019s buddies by a former Sun reporter, said that as Gunther charged, the Germans yelled and waved him back. But he kept on, firing with an automatic rifle. Finally, one of the machine guns fired a short burst.\n\n\u201cThat was the end of the war for Henry Gunther,\u201d Powell wrote.\n\nIt was 10:59 a.m. Gunther is believed to be the last American killed in World War I, and one of the estimated 2,700 men killed on both sides on the Western Front on the war\u2019s last day.\n\nShortly after 11, the German gunners emerged, put Gunther\u2019s body on a stretcher and carried it into the American lines.\n\nThey had to shoot him, they said, because he wouldn\u2019t stop, and it was either him or them.\n\nSpared from battle\n\nThe night before, amid rumors of an armistice, the American 115th Infantry Regiment, an outfit from Maryland, had received what one of its chaplains called a death sentence.\n\nBattered by bloody weeks at the front, where several men had committed suicide and others had suffered self-inflicted wounds, the regiment had been resting and recovering behind the lines.\n\nBut on Nov. 10, the 115th had been ordered to move out and join the assault on the ancient fortress city of Metz, then in Germany, scheduled for Nov. 14.\n\n\u201cAll hopes were dashed,\u201d the chaplain, Lt. Frederick C. Reynolds, wrote. They would be returning to \u201chell.\u201d\n\nThe following morning, \u201cwe rolled our packs \u2026 and with heavy hearts turned grim faces toward Metz,\u201d he recalled after the war.\n\nBut just before the march began, came word of the armistice.\n\nThere would be no attack on Metz. The war was over.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine \u2014 no, you can\u2019t imagine, it is impossible for anyone to imagine who did not experience it \u2014 the sense of relief and pure joy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe feeling of gratitude was too deep for noisy expression. \u2026 We quietly looked at each other, whispered a \u2018Thank God,\u2019 and wondered if it could really be true.\u201d\n\nAcross France, church bells rang, and people sang \u201cLa Marseillaise.\u201d In Paris, delirious citizens poured into the streets, linked arms, and clambered on top of trucks and cars. Veterans with crutches and empty coat sleeves joined in.\n\n\n\nSoldiers cheer as the news of the signing of the armistice reaches the 313th Sanitary Group of the 88th Division in Meurthe, France, on Nov. 11, 1918. (AP) (N/A/AP)\n\nIn the German trenches, joyous soldiers shouted that the war was over, and threw weapons and gear toward the American lines, according to Persico.\n\nIn London, at 11, Big Ben tolled for the first time in four years. Crowds rejoiced outside Buckingham Palace. In the House of Commons, Prime Minister Lloyd George said, \u201cI hope we may say that \u2026 on this fateful morning, came to an end all wars.\u201d\n\nBut some men weren\u2019t so happy.\n\nU.S. Army Lt. Col. George S. Patton Jr., for one, was dismayed that it was over. The future World War II hero wrote a bleak poem, \u201cPeace \u2014 November 11, 1918,\u201d in which he longed for more combat, according to National Archives historian Mitchell Yockelson.\n\nI stood in the flag-decked cheering crowd\n\nWhere all but I were gay ...\n\nAnother distraught soldier was a German veteran recovering in a hospital after being gassed. A clergyman broke the news of the armistice to the patients.\n\n\u201cI tottered \u2026 my way back to the dormitory, threw myself on my bunk, and dug my burning head into my blankets and pillow,\u201d he wrote later. \u201cThat night I resolved that, if I recovered \u2026 I would enter politics.\u201d\n\nThe soldier was Adolf Hitler.\n\nRead more:\n\nA retired archivist uncovered the stories of the Harlem Hellfighters captured in a famous photo\n\nA killer flu was raging.

The existence of the recordings was leaked to the media but never openly confirmed until now.\n\nTurkey says Khashoggi, who was critical of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was strangled and dismembered at the consulate as part of a premeditated killing.

Last year, when the Alabama-Mississippi State game occurred in a similar time frame and situation, the Crimson Tide needed a touchdown with 35 seconds left to secure a 31-24 win in Starkvegas. But here\u2019s one reason why that might not happen: In their two losses this season, the Bulldogs have converted on just 25.9 percent of their third-down chances (in victories, that number rises to 54.7 percent). Alabama\u2019s defense is giving up third-down conversions at just a 30 percent clip, which ranks 11th nationally. Here\u2019s another: Thanks mainly to shaky punting-kicking-return play, Mississippi State is a national bottom feeder in terms of both average starting field position (26.5-yard line, ranking 122nd) and opponent\u2019s average starting field position (31.8-yard line, 109th).

(Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe 2018 midterm election dramatically shifted the balance of power in the House of Representatives, from Republican to Democratic control. Many expected that, given President Trump\u2019s relatively low approval rating. Historically, that had meant the president\u2019s party would lose many House races. Pre-election polling largely confirmed the likely Democratic takeover.\n\nBut here\u2019s what we haven\u2019t yet known: Which groups supported the Democrats in this election? How do these patterns compare to previous elections?\n\nBelow, you can see five charts that help to explain what happened. For the most part, these charts are based on data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), a large-scale academic survey conducted in every election year since 2008. For the 2018 CCES analysis, we used pre-election interviews with respondents weighted to be nationally representative of the adult population. We then applied a likely voter model trained on previous election cycles to create estimates for the 2018 electorate.\n\n1. How did different age groups vote?\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at vote patterns among different age groups in House races over the past decade. While this year all age groups voted more Democratic than they had in 2016, those under 50 years old shifted more. In particular, 18- to 29-year-old voters chose Democratic candidates over Republican candidates by a 2-to-1 margin in 2018. And while we won\u2019t know for some time, some indications suggest they may have made up a larger share of the electorate than in typical midterm elections \u2014 or in other words, that young people turned out to vote in especially high numbers.\n\n[Majorities of millennials who intend to vote say they\u2019ll support Democrats \u2014 except among white men]\n\n2. How did suburbanites vote?\n\nSuburban districts were among the hardest-fought battlegrounds in this campaign. The CCES data show Democrats did well in those districts. The chart below shows the House vote among individuals living in the suburbs, broken out by U.S. region. Suburban voters supported Democratic House candidates by a healthy margin over Republican candidates in every region except the South, where the party breakdown was even.\n\n3. As expected, women and men voted very differently\n\nAnother pattern everyone was watching was the gender gap \u2014 which, as the next chart shows, was the largest we have seen in at least a decade. While nearly 60 percent of women who voted for one of the two major parties voted for Democratic candidates, only 47 percent of men did. That\u2019s a gender gap of 13 points.\n\n4. Let\u2019s break down women and men by race and education\n\nBut of course, women and men are incredibly broad groups, made up of every U.S. demographic. So which subgroups of women and men were furthest apart? The next chart plots the two-party vote share among white voters (since voters of color went overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates, no matter the gender), by gender and education.\n\n[Whites have fled the Democratic Party. Here\u2019s how the nation got here.]\n\nAs you can see, white women without college degrees moved modestly toward the Democrats, more so than white men without college degrees. But a far greater proportion of white college-educated women swung to the Democrats, even beyond their previous support for Democratic candidates in previous elections. How much did they swing? In 2018, white college-educated women increased their support for Democratic candidates by eight percentage points over 2016. In previous cycles, this group has accounted for about 15 percent of the electorate, so large Democratic margins among this demographic surely helped fuel Democratic candidates\u2019 success in 2018.\n\n5. Why did college-educated white women swing so far toward the Democrats?\n\nWhat explains college-educated white women\u2019s big shift? The final chart comes from analysis I conducted for Data for Progress. In that piece, I compare the role of voters\u2019 attitudes about women in this election to the role it played in 2018.\n\nAmong other factors, I looked at what researchers call \u201chostile sexism,\u201d a set of antagonistic attitudes toward women that stem from a belief that women want to control men. While hostile sexism was a strong predictor of support for Trump, it did not affect how people voted in their House races in 2016. That changed in 2018.\n\nThe chart below shows how higher levels of sexism are related to voting for the Republican candidate in both 2018 and 2016, controlling for other factors such as ideology, partisanship, racial attitudes and demographics. In 2016, a voter\u2019s agreement or disagreement with sexist statements (which you can find on the x-axis) did not matter much for whether they voted for the Republican House candidate. In 2018, however, people who were more likely to disagree with sexist statements (i.e., had less hostile sexism) were much less likely to vote Republican.\n\nIn essence, less-sexist voters punished Republican House candidates in a way they did not in 2016. What\u2019s more, Republicans did not gain any more sexist voters to offset that loss.\n\nOverall, these five charts suggest Republicans might wish to be concerned about being tied to a president whose rhetoric is often divisive and offensive. Doing so is turning off younger voters at historic rates, while also driving away women (especially those with college degrees). If the Republican Party brand becomes increasingly synonymous with Trump, these patterns may persist in 2020 and beyond.\n\nRead more:\n\nBrian F.

(Dinuka Liyanawatte/Reuters)\n\nSri Lanka plunged deeper into political crisis after the president issued a decree late Friday to dissolve Parliament and hold fresh elections, a move that experts called unconstitutional and opponents vowed to challenge in court.\n\nThe step marks the latest development in a showdown between Maithripala Sirisena, Sri Lanka\u2019s president, and Ranil Wickremesinghe, the country\u2019s sitting prime minister \u2014 a confrontation with profound implications for the future of Sri Lankan democracy.\n\nSirisena\u2019s decision to dissolve Parliament \u201cposes a vital threat to Sri Lanka\u2019s democratic institutions,\u201d the U.S. Embassy said in a statement released Saturday. Such actions \u201cjeopardize Sri Lanka\u2019s economic progress and international reputation.\u201d\n\nSirisena and Wickremesinghe represent different parties but had governed the island nation off the coast of India as part of a coalition government. Their partnership collapsed in spectacular fashion when Sirisena dismissed Wickremesinghe from his post on Oct. 26, a step that experts say violated Sri Lanka\u2019s constitution.\n\nSirisena named as the new prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, a controversial former president and strongman accused of using brutal force to end the country\u2019s 25-year-long civil war in 2009.\n\nThose moves have heightened tensions and brought the threat of violence as two men claim to be Sri Lanka\u2019s rightful prime minister. Wickremesinghe has remained in the official prime ministerial residence, surrounded by supporters, while Rajapaksa has installed loyalists as new cabinet ministers.\n\nThe United States and Europe have expressed grave concerns at the Sri Lankan president\u2019s maneuvers and had called for a swift vote in Parliament to demonstrate which of the two men claiming to be prime minister controls a majority in the chamber.\n\nBut Sirisena suspended the chamber and had refused to reconvene it until Wednesday \u2014 a move designed to give his ally Rajapaksa time to pull together votes.\n\nOn Friday, however, a presidential spokesman admitted that its faction was still short of the backing it needed. Hours later, at midnight, Sirisena issued a presidential gazette dissolving Parliament and calling for snap elections in January.\n\n\u201cThis is an illegal act. There is no provision within the constitution for the president to dissolve Parliament this way,\u201d Ajith Perera, a member of Wickremesinghe\u2019s United National Party (UNP) said on Saturday.\n\nUnder Sri Lanka\u2019s constitution, Parliament can be dissolved only under two conditions: when at least 4\u00bd years have passed since the most recent election, or when two-thirds of the members assent. Neither condition has been met.\n\nMembers of Wickremesinghe\u2019s party held emergency meetings Saturday to plot next steps. They also met with the country\u2019s Election Commission and urged it to follow the law. The Election Commission had yet to announce whether it will call for fresh polls.\n\nTwo UNP leaders, Kabir Hashim and Mangala Samaraweera, said they intended to file a case in the Supreme Court to challenge the dissolution.\n\nBhavani Fonseka, a lawyer and senior researcher at the Center for Policy Alternatives, a think tank in Colombo, said that organization also planned to challenge the presidential decree. Under the Sri Lankan constitution, she said, \u201cit is very clear that no one individual can dissolve Parliament.\u201d\n\nIn the weeks since the president\u2019s move to dismiss the prime minister, opposition to his unprecedented tactics has grown. On Monday, Karu Jayasuriya, the speaker of Parliament, said that recent events were a \u201csevere violation of democratic principles\u201d that \u201cshould not have occurred in a democratic society.\u201d\n\nSirisena has said the dismissal of Wickremesinghe was necessary to protect the national interest. In a televised address, Sirisena accused Wickremesinghe of corruption and of mishandling the investigation into an alleged assassination plot against him.\n\nAnalysts say that Sirisena\u2019s move was motivated not only by acrimony toward Wickremesinghe but also by political calculations. Sirisena and Rajapaksa are former rivals, but Rajapaksa\u2019s party emerged as the clear winner in recent local elections \u2014 making it a powerful partner for future polls.\n\nRajapaksa remains a popular figure in Sri Lanka for his role in ending the civil war. But the prospect of him returning to a leadership role in the country is a bleak one for human rights activists and many Tamils in the country\u2019s north.

(Associated Press)\n\nAt 11 a.m. on the 11th day of the 11th month of 2018, scores of world leaders are gathering in Paris to mark 100 years since the armistice that ended World War I entered into force, and to celebrate peace.\n\nThey represent countries that stood on opposite sides of the 1918 front line.

It was stated, however, that at 6 o\u2019clock Paris time, the signatures of Germany\u2019s delegates were fixed to the document which blasted forever the dreams which embroiled the world in a struggle which has cost, at the very lowest estimate, 10,000,000 lives.\n\n___\n\nLAST BLOW OF WAR\n\nWITH THE AMERICAN ARMY ON THE SEDAN FRONT, NOV. 11, 2 P.M. \u2014 Thousands of American heavy guns fired the parting shot to the Germans at exactly 11 o\u2019clock this morning.\n\nThe line reached by the American forces at 11 o\u2019clock today was being staked out this afternoon.\n\nThe Germans hurled a few shells into Verdun just before 11 o\u2019clock.\n\nOn the entire American front from the Moselle to the region of Sedan, there was artillery activity in the morning, all the batteries, preparing for the final salvos.\n\nAt many batteries the artillerists joined hands, forming a long line as the lanyard of the final shot. There was a few seconds of silence as the shell shot through the heavy mist. Then the gunners cheered.\n\nAmerican flags were raised by the soldiers over their dugouts and at the various headquarters.\n\nNortheast of Verdun, the American infantry began to advance at 9 o\u2019clock this morning, after artillery preparation, in the direction of the Ornes. The German artillery responded feebly, but the machine-gun resistance was stubborn. Nevertheless, the Americans made progress. The Americans had received orders to hold the positions reached by 11 o\u2019clock, and at those positions they began to dig in, marking the advanced positions of the Americans when hostilities ceased.\n\nAlong the American front, the 11th hour was like awaiting the arrival of the New Year.\n\nThe gunners continued to fire, counting the shells as the time approached. The infantry were advancing, glancing at their watches. The men holding at other places organized their position to make themselves more secure.\n\nThen the individual groups unfurled the Stars and Stripes, shook hands and cheered. Soon afterwards, they were preparing for luncheon.

(Pool Photo via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 The candidates vying to become the mayor of Taiwan\u2019s capital, Taipei, faced off in a televised debate on Saturday, two weeks before a host of local elections seen as a barometer of the ruling party\u2019s popularity.\n\nThe Nov. 24 mayoral election is one of hundreds being held in Taiwan for local government posts that are seen as a test of confidence in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, which swept to power in 2016 with the election of President Tsai Ing-wen and a solid majority in parliament.\n\nThe DPP\u2019s main opposition is the Nationalist Party, which relocated from mainland China amid civil war in 1949 and governed Taiwan for decades, first under martial law, then under full democracy beginning in the 1990s. The presidency has since alternated between the two parties, with the Nationalists, also known as the KMT, seen as more pro-China, and the DPP backing formal independence for Taiwan.\n\nIn Saturday\u2019s debate, incumbent Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je, an independent, asked voters to continue supporting him, but the ruling party\u2019s candidate, Pasuya Yao, said Ko has failed to make any changes in Taipei in the past four years.\n\nYao further emphasized that Taipei doesn\u2019t want to be bound by China\u2019s threats.\n\nTing Shou-chung, the Nationalist Party candidate, pledged to lead Taipei out of economic difficulties and to help foster a better relationship with China.\n\nTwo independent candidates \u2014 Li Hsi-kun and Wu E-yang \u2014 also took part in the debate.\n\nSurveys show most Taiwanese favor their island\u2019s current de facto independent status, rejecting both formal independence that might spark a military assault by China and political unification with Beijing.\n\nWhile China had in recent years largely eschewed threats that might spark a backlash at the polls, this year\u2019s elections come against the background of rising tensions over Beijing\u2019s demand that Tsai \u2014 who is up for re-election in 2020 \u2014 acknowledge its \u201cone-China\u201d principle that views Taiwan as a part of China under the Communist Party. China has increased diplomatic and economic pressure on Tsai\u2019s administration while staging military drills underscoring its determination to conquer the island by force if necessary.\n\nYet, local issues are likely to play a bigger factor among voters. The high-tech economy has struggled to match the growth rates of past years, leading to wage stagnation, particularly among the young, while there have also been pushes for pension reform and government streamlining to keep government spending in check.\n\nTaipei\u2019s aging housing stock and delays in projects such as a massive new sports and entertainment venue are also issues for voters in the island\u2019s capital.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s democracy is known for exuberant campaigning, including massive outdoor rallies, caravans of vehicles promoting the candidates, and visits to markets and parks.\n\nTaipei Mayor Ko, 59, gained added attention this year by starring in a rap video, and online messaging has grown increasingly important in one of the world\u2019s most wired societies.\n\nThat\u2019s also brought warnings of cyberattacks and disinformation coming from China, similar to how Russian government-backed entities are believed to have spread fake news in the U.S.\n\nKo came under attack for skipping a first debate earlier this month, with critics calling him aloof and the mayor defending himself as a diligent administrator.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n (D-N.M.), Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman, celebrate a projected Democratic takeover of the House on Tuesday in Washington. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAn ambitious crop of younger Democrats are reaping the spoils of victory in the House.\n\nAfter years of grumbling about House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s hold on power, the new majority has opened up leadership posts with real responsibility, and the next generation is seizing this moment.\n\nMore than a dozen Democrats have launched bids for six leadership positions, with almost every contender a junior lawmaker who has served fewer than four terms. Most of these Democrats have never been in the majority, but they have all viewed themselves as heirs to the trio who have run the caucus for almost 16 years.\n\nWith a fresh majority, they have a chance to claim lower-level leadership posts that have some actual power. The question for Pelosi is whether this new dynamic might also help relieve the pressure on Pelosi and her top lieutenants, Reps. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) and James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.).\n\nAll three are looking to grab the top three positions \u2014 speaker, majority leader, majority whip \u2014 in the face of resistance from some internal Democratic critics.\n\nThose rebels continue to try to find a way to topple Pelosi, but their biggest problem is the lack of any challenger so far in the Democratic vote, slated for Nov. 28.\n\nThese wealthy neighborhoods delivered Democrats the House majority A precinct-level analysis of 2018 House races shows high-income suburban voters backed Democrats in key races.\n\n\n\nOnce 10-term Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) lost his primary in June, the field of potential Democratic leaders quickly lost gravitas.\n\nPelosi\u2019s Democratic opponents scramble to organize the resistance\n\nInstead, the up-and-coming Democrats are scrambling for positions that will give them the chance to impress colleagues and then run for the top spots once Pelosi, 78, Hoyer, 79, and Clyburn, 78, inevitably head off to retirement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running for this leadership position because, as someone who comes from a district that voted for Donald Trump, I live and breathe this every day of my congressional career,\u201d Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) said Friday in a statement launching her bid to chair the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \u201cThe most effective way I can improve the lives of hard-working Americans is by helping secure our new Democratic majority.\u201d\n\nBustos, 57, just got elected to serve her fourth term in a somewhat rural district in western Illinois. A former reporter and editor for the Quad-City Times, she has been widely seen as one of the party\u2019s most effective communicators, particularly on economic issues relating to middle-class wage stagnation.\n\nBut there\u2019s no such thing as a free pass, so Bustos is probably squaring off against a pair of Washington Democrats, Reps. Denny Heck, 66, and Suzan DelBene, 56, who have held deputy positions at the caucus\u2019s political arm the past few years.\n\nAll three contenders were first elected to Congress in 2012.\n\n\u201cThese were not wallflowers. These were not people who were content to be backbenchers,\u201d former congressman Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) said.\n\nAs chairman of the DCCC in 2012 and 2014, Israel helped recruit those three and knows many of the other relative newcomers in leadership races.\n\nAt least one Democrat is angling for one of the top spots as 61-year-old Rep. Diana DeGette (Colo.) is challenging Clyburn for majority whip.\n\nTwo other key contests are for assistant Democratic leader and the chairman of the Democratic Caucus.\n\nPelosi created the first position after the 2010 midterms threw Democrats out of the majority, giving Clyburn a soft landing because the minority traditionally has one fewer leadership position.\n\n\u2018Know the power to win:\u2019 Pelosi engineers a House Democratic comeback\n\nHe\u2019s running for his old job of majority whip, creating a contest to replace him as assistant leader that will test the ideological and political geographic bounds of the caucus: Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n (N.M.) vs. Rep. David N. Cicilline (R.I.).\n\nLuj\u00e1n, 46, is coming off a four-year run as DCCC chairman, from the disappointing 2016 election to Tuesday\u2019s romp over Republicans. Cicilline, 57, is a senior member of the Progressive Caucus, co-chair of the LGBT Equality Caucus and two years ago won election as co-chair of a policy committee.\n\nThe caucus chair contest is a generational clash within the Congressional Black Caucus: 72-year-old Rep. Barbara Lee (Calif.), a 20-year veteran, against 48-year-old Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), first elected in 2012.\n\nPelosi does not wield the same clout inside the caucus as she did eight years ago, so she is focused entirely on her own bid to lock down the votes to become the first person to return to the speaker\u2019s rostrum since 1955.\n\nThat means these down-ballot races are even more wide open, unlike in previous post-election seasons of defeat and recrimination. After those losses, Pelosi would tamp down rebellion by creating new leadership posts, some of which had real clout, some of which were just window dressing.\n\nThe biggest wild card, for the speaker election and other posts, will probably be the incoming freshman class, which will at least number 54. That\u2019s about 20 percent of the vote in the secret-ballot races.\n\n\u201cWe keep our word, we keep our promises, and I hope people find that refreshing,\u201d Rep.-elect Jason Crow (D-Colo.) told The Washington Post\u2019s Mike DeBonis on Thursday in insisting he won\u2019t vote for Pelosi.\n\nCrow and several others pledged during their campaigns not to back Pelosi. It\u2019s unclear how many will vote against her during the internal vote later this month and then say that they have to vote for her in the public roll call Jan. 3 in the full House, rather than do anything to help Republicans.\n\nA final spoil of victory are committee assignments, which grow substantially for the majority party.\n\nOnly 14 Democrats are returning next year who currently serve on the Ways and Means Committee, the panel that oversees health, trade and tax issues. The next speaker will be able to add about 10 new members to that committee.\n\nThere will be about 10 more spots, combined, on the powerful Appropriations and Energy and Commerce committees.\n\nPelosi will no doubt try to win over holdouts with promises of support for getting those lawmakers onto the key committees of their choice.\n\nShould she win, however, even close allies believe that she won\u2019t remain speaker for long. Israel said that once these junior Democrats get into the somewhat powerful leadership posts, they will soon view the top posts as theirs for the taking.\n\nThis group will be content in these lower-level spots \u201cfor the time being,\u201d he said. \u201cThose positions will be steppingstones.\u201d\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "President Trump flew 3,800 miles to this French capital city for ceremonies to honor the military sacrifice in World War I, hoping to take part in the kind of powerful ode to the bravery of the armed forces that he was unable to hold in Washington.\n\nBut on his first full day here, it rained on his substitute parade weekend.\n\nEarly Saturday, the White House announced Trump and the first lady had scuttled plans, due to bad weather, for their first stop in the weekend\u2019s remembrance activities \u2014 a visit to the solemn Aisne Marne American Cemetery, marking the ferocious Battle of Belleau Wood.\n\n[The Battle of Belleau Wood was brutal, deadly and forgotten.

The event will not feature tanks or missiles like the parade Trump had envisioned on the streets of Washington on Veterans Day but canceled due to exorbitant costs.\n\nAfter another scheduled visit to a ceremony on Sunday, the president plans to fly home just as Macron\u2019s Paris Peace Forum kicks off for three days of meetings aimed at galvanizing global action on shared challenges, such as climate change.\n\nThomas Wright, a Europe expert at the Brookings Institution, noted Trump announced he was going to France on a whim in August after abruptly canceling his order for the Pentagon to stage a parade.\n\nThe Peace Forum was intended \u201ca bit as a counterpoint to \u2018America First,\u2019 \u201d Wright said, referring to Trump\u2019s nationalist foreign policy in which he has unsettled allies on trade and defense. \u201cNow they have this weird situation of Trump being there [in Paris] but the forum going against everything he and [National Security Adviser John] Bolton stand for. . . . My impression is that he\u2019s going to pretend like it\u2019s not happening.\u201d\n\nIn the evening, Trump tweeted that he had spent the afternoon in meetings and making calls, though he gave no details.

Trump revived his frustration over countries in the NATO alliance that do not spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on their militaries.\n\nAhead of their bilateral meeting at Elysee Palace, Macron attempted to soothe Trump by stressing publicly that European nations in the NATO alliance should pay more to defend themselves.\n\nCalling Trump \u201cmy good friend,\u201d Macron proclaimed \u201cgreat solidarity\u201d between the two nations and said the leaders will discuss a litany of issues during their one-on-one meeting, including Iran, Syria, Yemen, trade and climate change.\n\nTrump reciprocated Macron\u2019s warm tone, telling the French leader that we \u201chave become very good friends\u201d and that the two countries \u201chave much in common in many ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cI appreciate what you\u2019re saying about burden sharing.

It is military officials who would make that determination. This story has been updated.\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news\n\nOpinion: How Trump lost the midterms\n\n18 moments that shaped the midterms", "\n\nThen-Attorney General Jeff Sessions speaks in Portland, Maine, on July 13. (Robert F. Bukaty/AP)\n\nThat President Trump finally ousted Jeff Sessions as attorney general, the day after the midterm elections, was hardly a surprise. Angry at Sessions\u2019s decision to recuse himself from overseeing special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign, Trump had lashed out frequently at what he called the \u201cJustice\u201d Department. He mocked Sessions\u2019s tenure there as \u201cDISGRACEFUL!\u201d and even (at least according to Bob Woodward, though Trump denied it) called his AG a \u201cmentally retarded . . . dumb Southerner.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s choice to step in as acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, immediately drew political fire. That was also unsurprising. Whitaker, who was Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, has frequently and publicly attacked the Mueller probe and the courts. He also chaired Sam Clovis\u2019s campaign for Iowa state treasurer \u2014 before Clovis co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign and appeared as a witness before the Mueller grand jury.\n\nAs a result, Democratic senators, ethics groups and state attorneys general are calling on Whitaker, too, to recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller investigation. The state attorneys general, for instance, told Whitaker his past comments meant \u201ca reasonable person could question your impartiality in the matter.\u201d Some GOP lawmakers have weighed in too, with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) opining that \u201cMueller must be allowed to complete his work without interference \u2014 regardless of who is AG.\u201d\n\nYet even as Whitaker suggested that he has no intention of recusing himself (yet another non-shocker), some surprising news did arrive. In a Thursday New York Times op-ed, well-known constitutional lawyers Neal K. Katyal and George T. Conway III argued Whitaker\u2019s appointment was not just unwise but also unconstitutional.\n\nThe legal argument hinges on the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act (FVRA), which lays out who can serve in an acting role, and for how long, when a top-ranking government official resigns. (It\u2019s less clear how it applies when someone is fired \u2014 thus, the fact that Sessions resigned, even under duress, is important.)\n\nThe FVRA offers three ways to replace a Cabinet-level official\n\nBasically, the FVRA offers three options. First, the officer\u2019s \u201cfirst assistant\u201d can step in. At the Justice Department, that would be Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who many think is already in Trump\u2019s line of fire. Rosenstein, you\u2019ll recall, reportedly proposed using the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office.\n\nSecond, the president can choose someone else for the job \u2014 as long as that person is presently serving in a Senate-confirmed position. This is how Mick Mulvaney, confirmed by the Senate in 2017 as director of the Office of Management and Budget, is able to serve as acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau without additional Senate review.\n\nOr third, the president can choose someone who is not Senate-confirmed, as long as they are a senior official paid at least at the GS-15 level of the federal civil service salary scale (about $135,000 in Washington). Normally that would mean a career government employee, not a political appointee, but not invariably.\n\nTrump chose Door No. 3, naming Whitaker, whose only confirmation by the Senate was in 2004 when he became a U.S. attorney. He left that job in 2009; the chief of staff position did not require confirmation. But it does meet the salary threshold, and thus qualifies Whitaker to serve under the FVRA for a 210-day period.\n\nBut these two scholars argue that FVRA itself is unconstitutional \u2014 and cite Justice Clarence Thomas\n\nBut there\u2019s still a problem, according to Katyal and Conway: They argue the FVRA itself overrides the constitutional provision that all \u201cprincipal officers\u201d receive Senate confirmation. The attorney general, supervised only by the president, is certainly a principal officer. And thus the case, they argue, is open and shut:\n\nWe cannot tolerate such an evasion of the Constitution\u2019s very explicit, textually precise design. \u2026 For the president to install Mr. Whitaker as our chief law enforcement officer is to betray the entire structure of our charter document.\n\nFor reinforcement, they turn to a notable ally: Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. In a 2017 case, Thomas agreed with a court decision concerning the FVRA, but wrote a concurring opinion that went much further.\n\n\u201cAppointing principal officers under the FVRA,\u201d Thomas concluded, \u201craises grave constitutional concerns because the Appointments Clause forbids the President to appoint principal officers without the advice and consent of the Senate.\u201d Doing so, he argued, risked making the clause \u201can empty formality.\u201d\n\nPolitically, it would be relatively easy for the Trump White House to dismiss an argument coming from Katyal alone; he\u2019s worked for Al Gore, Barack Obama and on behalf of Guantanamo Bay detainees. But Conway\u2019s pedigree is quite different. While he has recently become a public critic of Trump, in the 1990s Conway helped with the Paula Jones case that helped lead to Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment; he is married to high-ranking Trump staffer Kellyanne Conway; and he was seriously considered for the role of Trump\u2019s solicitor general.\n\nThomas\u2019s opinion naturally carries even more weight in conservative legal circles \u2014 and, suddenly, has been taken as gold by opponents of the president eager to protect Mueller. If this portion of the FVRA is indeed unconstitutional \u2014 the case is hardly a slam dunk \u2014 then any actions taken by someone appointed in this manner would be legally void.\n\nBut be careful what you wish for\n\nEven so, fans of good government might be careful what they wish for. As Stanford Law School\u2019s Anne Joseph O\u2019Connell notes: \u201cWe need the Vacancies Act for temporary gap-filling. The modern appointments process is brutal.\u201d Her research shows that one-fifth of appointed positions may be vacant at any given time \u2014 necessitating acting fill-ins \u2014 and even successful appointments can take months. Both of those trends have likely been exacerbated during the first two years of the Trump administration.\n\nIf this week\u2019s strange new bedfellows succeed in legally truncating the FVRA, it may preserve the independence of the Mueller investigation \u2014 at least for a time. But it would do so at the cost of preventing experienced career officials from stepping into high-ranking acting roles. Thus winning the short-term battle might undermine the long-term war for administrative competence and stability in government.\n\nRead more by Andrew Rudalevige:", "Maj. Brent R.

(Abdul Rahman Rahmani/Abdul Rahman Rahmani)\n\nRahmani, who often posts online, described himself in an interview as one of a new generation of Afghan military officers who strongly believe in a partnership with the United States.\n\nHe said he wrote the letter in part to make clear that such insider attacks do not represent the sentiments of most Afghans toward Americans.\n\n\u201cI wanted to convey two messages.

His unit works closely with Afghan commandos and coalition special operations forces.\n\nHe said he and Taylor had participated in several missions together, often talking about the war and their lives. Several weeks ago, they were chatting when Rahmani received a call from home. The children were making noise, and Rahmani started shouting. When he hung up, he said, Taylor asked him to speak more gently.\n\n\u201cFamily is everything,\u201d he wrote in the letter, quoting Taylor.\n\nRahmani said he had lost eight of his own family members, including his father, in Afghanistan\u2019s years of conflict. He has participated in high-risk missions and been wounded twice. When an Afghan army hospital was attacked in 2017, he recalled, he landed on the roof and took rocket fire while a team of Afghan commandos jumped out.\n\nLike Rahmani, Taylor often posted on Facebook, using it to stay in touch with his constituents while he was in Afghanistan. Last month he posted a message to \u201cdear North Ogden friends,\u201d saying, \u201cthings are going great over here for our team\u201d as it helped to secure the parliamentary election.\n\nAfter the Oct. 20 election, Taylor wrote another Facebook post, saying it was \u201cbeautiful to see over 4 million Afghan men and women brave threats and deadly attacks to vote.\u201d He called the high turnout \u201ca success\u201d for Afghans and \u201cfor the cause of human freedom.\u201d\n\nTaylor also wrote that he felt proud of the soldiers he served with. \u201cMany American, NATO allies, and Afghan troops have died to make moments like this possible,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDuring 17 years of fighting, more than 150 U.S.-led coalition troops have been killed in insider attacks, according to military reports.

That was based on a calculation that around 30 percent of severely malnourished children who didn\u2019t receive proper treatment likely died.\n\nRenewed uproar over the destruction has put Washington in a corner. The U.S. has sold billions of dollars in weaponry to Saudi Arabia, backing the fight to stop Shiite rebels known as Houthis, who Washington and the coalition consider a proxy for Iran.\n\nThat along with tensions over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul may be key factors why Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Oct. 30 made their biggest push yet for an end to the war, calling for a ceasefire within 30 days and resumed negotiations.\n\nOnly a month earlier, Pompeo gave a powerful show of support to the coalition by certifying to Congress that Saudi Arabia and its allies were taking measures to prevent civilian casualties. Certification was a required step in continuing U.S. aid, which includes providing intelligence used in targeting and mid-air refueling for coalition planes.\n\nBut deaths from the coalition campaign show no sign of slowing.\n\nCoalition airstrikes and shelling killed at least 4,489 civilians since the beginning of 2016 \u2014 nearly three-quarters of all known civilian deaths, according to ACLED\u2019s figures.\n\nAs of Nov. 3, at least 1,254 civilians were killed by the coalition this year, a rate of four a day. In comparison, 1,386 civilians died in strikes the previous year, or 3.79 a day.\n\nAsked about the finding, the U.S. State Department said in an emailed reply, \u201cThroughout this conflict, the United States has urged all parties to abide by the Law of Armed Conflict, work to prevent harm to civilians and civilian infrastructure, and thoroughly investigate and ensure accountability for any violations.\u201d\n\nBloodshed has surged from fierce fighting at the Red Sea port city of Hodeida, which coalition forces have been trying to retake from the Houthis since June. Civilians have been killed in airstrikes as well as by Houthi shelling and land mines.\n\nSince June, more than 4,500 people \u2014 including 515 confirmed civilians \u2014 have been killed in Hodeida, nearly triple the number from the first five months of the year.\n\nAid agencies fear worse is yet to come. The coalition appears to be accelerating its assault before any cease-fire. Its forces have nearly encircled the city, where tens of thousands of people are trapped along with thousands of Houthi fighters. The port is Yemen\u2019s main point of entry for food and humanitarian aid, so any cutoff could push millions into starvation.\n\nThe coalition launched its air campaign in March 2015 after the Houthis took over northern and central Yemen, driving out the internationally recognized government. The rebels were prevented from overrunning the south only by the coalition\u2019s bombardment and support for militia forces.\n\nTracking casualties is enormously difficult. The few independent monitors on the ground do not have wide access; officials on both sides have an interest in manipulating figures; deaths often take place in remote areas and even in populated areas, confusion of battle makes confirming numbers hard.\n\nThe most widely used estimate has been 10,000 dead, made in January 2017 by the United Nations.\n\nIn October, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator said at least 65,000 people have been killed or injured since 2016, including 16,000 civilians killed, based on data from health centers. U.N. officials did not reply to queries to elaborate on the figures.\n\nACLED builds its database on news reports from Yemeni and international media and international agencies. It covers everything from airstrikes, shelling and ground battles between the various forces to militant bombings and violence at protests. The group receives funding in part from the U.S. State Department and Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nBecause of its transparency, its figures are often cited by U.N. agencies and non-governmental organizations. But they caution that even ACLED\u2019s data cannot give the full picture \u2014 only \u201cthe least bad best guess\u201d as an official at one agency put it.\n\nPinning down how many of the dead are civilians is even tougher.\n\nACLED counted 6,242 civilians killed since 2016 by \u201cremote violence\u201d on civilian targets \u2014 meaning airstrikes, artillery or shelling by either side. Of those, shelling by the Houthis or their allies killed 977.\n\nThe full toll is likely much higher. The vast majority of deaths \u2014 more than 34,000 \u2014 are categorized by ACLED as resulting from battles. But it is impossible to determine whether those are combatants or civilians, Carboni said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely an underestimate,\u201d he said of the civilian toll. \u201cThe numbers caught in the crossfire are not known.\u201d\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writers Maggie Michael in Cairo and Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Confidence: Medium", "PARIS \u2014 President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron tried to project unity Saturday after Trump had lashed out at one of America\u2019s strongest allies in Europe, claiming Macron insulted the United States when he pushed the idea of the continent having its own defense force.\n\nThe American and French leaders, who have had an up-and-down relationship, told reporters they were good friends before going behind closed doors for talks at the Elysee Palace. It was Trump\u2019s first stop on a weekend trip to Paris where dozens of world leaders were gathering to commemorate Sunday\u2019s 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.\n\nTrump also had been scheduled to visit the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery at Belleau Wood on Saturday, but canceled because of rainy weather that grounded the presidential helicopter. The president was criticized for not finding a way to get to the cemetery, which is about a two-hour drive east of Paris, where Americans killed in World War I are buried. The White House sent a delegation that included chief of staff John Kelly in his place.\n\nThe dustup over European security, which threatened to divert attention from the weekend\u2019s somber remembrance ceremonies, was just the latest example of fallout from Trump\u2019s unpredictable brand of Twitter-assisted diplomacy.\n\nHis fractious, destabilizing relationship with Europe has driven a wedge between the U.S. and some of its oldest allies on issues including trade, defense spending and his seeming deference to their looming neighbor to the east, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. It also underscored the hot-and-cold relationship that Trump has had with Macron, who has increasingly branded himself as a bulwark against the rising tide of Trump-style nationalism across Europe.\n\nThe brouhaha began Friday night, when Trump unleashed an angry Twitter jab at his host just as Air Force One touched down in Paris. Trump tweeted that Macron \u201chas just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet was especially wounding to Macron. Macron\u2019s office said Trump had misunderstood the French leaders\u2019 comments, lumping together two different ideas. Macron had said in an interview that Europe needs to protect itself against cyber threats and the \u201cinterference in our democracies\u201d from \u201cChina, Russia and even the United States.\u201d Later, he made the case that Europe needs to build up its own military because it can no longer depend on the U.S. for defense.\n\nThe two men struck a more friendly tone as they opened their meeting at the grand presidential residence.\n\n\u201cWe want to help Europe but it has to be fair. Right now, the burden-sharing has been largely on the United States,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump has long complained about uncompensated U.S. defense spending that benefits allies, and earlier this year threatened to turn his back on NATO if members didn\u2019t boost their defense spending. Trump said Macron \u201cunderstands that and he understands the United States can only do so much.\u201d\n\nMacron defended his viewpoint, saying he shares Trump\u2019s insistence that there be more burden sharing. He said it\u2019s \u201cunfair to have the European security today being assured just by the United States,\u201d but did not respond to a question about why he felt France needed protection from the U.S.\n\nThe episode was the latest example of a frequent Trump pattern: introducing tension before meeting with a world leader, then playing nice when they\u2019re face-to-face.\n\nBefore Trump traveled to Britain earlier this year, he gave an interview to a British tabloid in which he insulted British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s approach to the United Kingdom leaving the European Union. Trump said her political nemesis would make a great prime minister.\n\nThe interview was published as Trump was attending a grand welcome dinner hosted by May only hours after he arrived in London. Trump was far more cordial to May in person, complimenting her leadership and expressing his great respect for her.\n\nIt was the same with Macron, who welcomed Trump in the courtyard of the Elysee Palace with a handshake and pats on the arm. Inside a gilded meeting room, Macron referred to Trump as \u201cmy good friend\u201d and, at one point, tapped him on the thigh. Trump said they had become \u201cvery good friends over the last couple of years\u201d and were \u201csimilar in our views\u201d on many issues.\n\nMacron early on had tried to position himself as Europe\u2019s \u201cTrump whisperer.\u201d But their personal relationship has failed to make much difference when it comes to stopping Trump from pursuing policies Macron strongly opposes.\n\nDespite his insistent urging, Trump failed to heed Macron and other European leaders\u2019 advice not to pull the U.S. out of the landmark Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal. He also refused to spare France from the tariffs he\u2019s slapped on steel and aluminum imports, citing national security risks. Trump has also been chipping away at a rules-based, multilateral system the U.S. helped build and Macron has worked to defend.\n\nWeaker at home for unpopular economic policies and increasingly isolated in Europe, Macron has been positioning himself as a sort of anti-Trump, speaking out against the rising tide of Trump-style populist nationalism across Europe and the dangers of isolationist retreat. At the U.N. General Assembly this year, Macron said: \u201cNationalism always leads to defeat,\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s starting to become the antithesis of President Trump\u2019s public messaging,\u201d said Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at Center for Strategic and International Studies \u201cHe believes he is one voice that can champion this.\u201d\n\nCentral to those efforts is the inaugural Paris Peace Forum, a gathering of heads of state, government officials, heads of international organizations, corporations, academics, philanthropists and others beginning Sunday. The forum aims to revive collective governance and international cooperation to tackle global challenges.\n\nTrump, however, will not be attending. The White House cited a scheduling conflict, saying the president instead would attend a Veterans Day ceremony to pay respects to U.S. soldiers who died on French soil.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Angela Charlton in Paris and Jonathan Lemire and Deb Riechmann in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press\u2019 WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___\n\nFollow Jill Colvin and Darlene Superville on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj and https://twitter.com/dsupervilleap\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Philippe Wojazer/Pool Photo via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nPARIS \u2014 Traveling from across the world to monuments honoring soldiers who fell 100 years ago, victors and vanquished alike marked those sacrifices Saturday ahead of Armistice Day and assessed alliances that have been redrawn dramatically since the dark days of World War I.\n\nThe leaders of former enemies France and Germany, in an intimate gesture that underscored their countries\u2019 current roles as guarantors of peace in Europe, held their heads together at the site north of Paris where the defeated Germans and the Allies signed the agreement that ended the 1914-18 war.\n\nAfter Chancellor Angela Merkel briefly snuggled her head into the neck of French President Emmanuel Macron, the two went inside a replica of the train car where the armistice was reached and put their names in a guestbook. Macron then took Merkel\u2019s hand in his, again highlighting the changes on the continent where two world wars were fought in the 20th century.\n\n\u201cOur Europe has been at peace for 73 years. There is no precedent for it, and it is at peace because we willed it and first and foremost, because Germany and France wanted it,\u201d he said.\n\nMerkel was equally convinced of the power their friendship exudes.\n\n\u201cThe will is there, and I say this for Germany with full conviction, to do everything to achieve a more peaceful order in the world even though we know we have very, very much work still ahead of us,\u201d she said.\n\nThe open show of affection was a welcome antidote for Macron. Earlier Saturday, the French leader had a somewhat awkward meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. As Air Force One landed in Paris on Friday night, Trump wrote on Twitter he had been \u201cvery\u201d insulted by comments Macron made in the days before that he considered anti-American.\n\nA century ago, the entry of U.S. troops into World War I tipped the momentum toward its allies, including France and Britain. Even as he embarked on two days of observances for the Nov. 11, 1918 armistice, Trump said the United States now bears far too much of the burden to defend the West.\n\nA flurry of Armistice-related diplomacy once again turned Paris, the jewel that Germany sought to take in 1914 but which the Allies successfully fought to defend, into the center of global attention Saturday as dozens of world leaders arrived in the French capital on the eve of the solemn centennial commemorations.\n\nMerkel\u2019s appearance in Compiegne marked how her nation\u2019s bloodstained history with France has become a close alliance that is now the driving force behind the European Union.\n\nIn the four years of fighting, remembered for brutal trench warfare and the first use of gas, France, the British empire, Russia and the United States had the main armies opposing a German-led coalition that also included the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires.\n\nAlmost 10 million soldiers died. France lost 1.4 million and Germany 2 million.\n\nYet, despite a war that was supposed to end all wars, World War II pitted both sides against each other once again in 1940.\n\nAcross the line that once marked the Western Front, leaders lauded the courage of soldiers who were killed during the unprecedented slaughter, before converging on Paris for a dinner.\n\nAt the dinner, Macron warned world leaders against taking peace for granted, saying \u201cwe will talk about this peace that our predecessors tried to construct 100 years ago but failed to preserve, because 20 years later a new war broke out.\u201d\n\nThe armistice entered into force on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, and on Sunday 69 world leaders will commemorate the centennial of the event at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, underneath the Arc de Triomphe in central Paris.\n\nAt dawn Saturday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau went to Vimy Ridge, the battlefield in northern France where Canada found its sense of self when it defeated German opposition against the odds.\n\nStanding amid the white headstones against an ashen sky, Trudeau addressed the fallen, saying what Canada has achieved in the past century has been \u201ca history built on your sacrifice. You stand for the values on which Canada was built.\u201d\n\nIn southern Belgium\u2019s Mons, Canadians were also lauding George Price, the last Commonwealth soldier to die in the war when he was shot by a German sniper two minutes before the armistice took effect.\n\nTrump was looking beyond the tragedy of death and destruction, asking in a tweet: \u201cIs there anything better to celebrate than the end of a war, in particular that one, which was one of the bloodiest and worst of all time?\u201d\n\nAfter his meeting with Macron, Trump had been scheduled to head to the battlefield of Belleau Wood, 90 kilometers (55 miles) northeast of the capital, where U.S. troops had their breakthrough battle by stopping a German push for Paris shortly after entering the war in 1917.\n\nThe battle of Belleau Wood proved America\u2019s mettle to allies and foes alike, and by the time the war ended U.S. forces were at least an equal to any of the other major armies, which were exhausted and depleted.\n\nHowever, Trump canceled his visit because of bad weather and immediately came in for criticism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible that a president would travel to France for this significant anniversary - and then remain in his hotel room watching TV rather than pay in person his respects to the Americans who gave their lives in France for the victory gained 100 years ago tomorrow,\u201d David Frum, a speechwriter for former President George W. Bush, tweeted,\n\nThe White House sent a delegation that included chief of staff John Kelly in Trump\u2019s place. Ben Rhodes, who served as deputy national security adviser in the Obama administration, said the White House should have had a fallback plan for the president.\n\n\u201cThere is always a rain option.

The flag marks the post that is to be dismantled so that each side can observe the work in progress.(South Korea Defense Ministry via AP). (Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The North and South Korean militaries completed withdrawing troops and firearms from 22 front-line guard posts on Saturday as they continue to implement a wide-ranging agreement reached in September to reduce tensions across the world\u2019s most fortified border, a South Korean Defense Ministry official said.\n\nSouth Korea says the military agreement is an important trust-building step that would help stabilize peace and advance reconciliation between the rivals. But critics say the South risks conceding some of its conventional military strength before North Korea takes any meaningful steps on denuclearization \u2014 an anxiety that\u2019s growing as the larger nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang seemingly drift into a stalemate.\n\nSouth Korea reportedly has about 60 guard posts \u2014 bunker-like concrete structures surrounded with layers of barbed-wire fences and manned by soldiers equipped with machine guns \u2014 stretched across the ironically named Demilitarized Zone.\n\nThe 248-kilometer (155-mile) border buffer peppered with millions of land mines has been the site of occasional skirmishes between the two forces since the 1950-53 Korean War. The North is believed to have about 160 guard posts within the DMZ.\n\nIn the September military agreement, reached on the sidelines of a summit in Pyongyang between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, the Koreas pledged to eventually withdraw all guard posts within the DMZ, but to start by removing 11 from each side as a \u201cpreliminary\u201d measure.\n\nThe South Korean Defense Ministry official said soldiers on Saturday completed disarming 11 guard posts on the southern side of the DMZ. He said the ministry believes the North has also finished withdrawing personnel and weapons from 11 guard posts on the northern side of the DMZ. He didn\u2019t want to be named, citing office rules.\n\nThe Koreas plan to destroy 20 of the structures by the end of November, while symbolically leaving one demilitarized guard post on each side. They plan to jointly verify the results in December.\n\nThe Koreas also in the September deal agreed to create buffer zones along their land and sea boundaries and a no-fly zone above the border, which took effect on Nov. 1.\n\nThe Koreas and the U.S.-led U.N. Command recently finished removing firearms and troops from a jointly controlled area at the border village of Panmunjom and eventually plan to allow tourists to freely move around there. The Koreas have also been clearing mines from front-line areas and plan to start in April their first-ever joint search for remains of soldiers killed during the Korean War.\n\nWhile the Korean militaries move ahead with tension-reducing steps, Moon is otherwise running out of goodwill gestures toward North Korea, which is under heavy U.S.-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons program. Unless the sanctions are lifted, it would be impossible for Moon to push ahead with his more ambitious plans for engagement, such as reconnecting railways and roads across the border and normalizing operations at a jointly run factory park.\n\nPyongyang insists that sanctions should be removed before there is any progress in nuclear negotiations, while Washington says they will remain until the North takes concrete steps toward irreversibly and verifiably relinquishing its weapons.\n\nAnalysts say the discord may have caused the last-minute cancellation of a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yong Chol, that had been scheduled for this past Thursday to discuss denuclearization issues and setting up a second summit between Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Czarek Sokolowski, File/Associated Press)\n\nWARSAW, Poland \u2014 The Polish government and the organizers of a march put on by nationalist groups annually for the country\u2019s independence holiday have agreed to hold a joint event in Warsaw Sunday on the 100th anniversary of Poland\u2019s rebirth as a state.\n\nThe announcement late Friday means President Andrzej Duda, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and other state officials will join groups who held a march in Warsaw last year where racist banners and white supremacist symbols were displayed.\n\nMichal Dworczyk, the head of Morawiecki\u2019s chancellery, tweeted that both sides reached an agreement, adding: \u201cPoland won. On Nov. 11 there will be a great communal march to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Independence!\u201d\n\nThe deal was also announced by the top march organizer, Robert Bakiewicz. He is a leader of the National Radical Camp, which traces its roots to an anti-Semitic movement of the 1930s.\n\nThe development underscored how the ruling Law and Justice party has at times sought to embrace the same base that supports far-right groups. It\u2019s a source of controversy in Poland, where many are furious at how radical nationalists came to dominate the Independence Day holiday.\n\nDuda said he wants the participants to walk \u201cunder white-and-red flags, under our national colors, under the motto of a free and independent Poland.\u201d\n\nThe president told Poland\u2019s Nasz Dziennik newspaper he wants all the participating groups to leave their individual emblems and banners expressing their particular point of view behind.\n\nLast year\u2019s march in the capital was cited in a recent European Parliament resolution that called for member states to act decisively against far-right extremism. It noted the presence at that march of xenophobic banners with slogans such as \u201cwhite Europe of brotherly nations,\u201d and flags depicting the \u201cfalanga,\u201d a far-right symbol dating to the 1930s.\n\nThe announcement of the joint march comes after chaotic days of preparations and negotiations with the nationalist group before the centennial of Poland\u2019s independence, which was regained at the end of World War I in 1918 when the three empires \u2014 Russia, Austria and Germany \u2014 that had ruled Poland for more than a century collapsed in defeat.\n\nDuda\u2019s office held talks with march organizers over several months in hopes of reaching an agreement on a joint march. But the talks broke down when the nationalists refused a demand to have no banners.\n\nNew talks between state officials and the nationalists took place Friday leading to the announcement of an agreement.\n\nWladyslaw Frasyniuk, a hero of the anti-communist Solidarity movement of the 1980s, strongly criticized the authorities for what he described as pandering to \u201cbandits\u201d and \u201cfascists.\u201d\n\nLaw and Justice party spokeswoman Beata Mazurek appealed to all participants to be a \u201cguardian\u201d of order at the march and to report any \u201cprovocative behavior\u201d to the police.\n\nOn the eve of the anniversary, Duda, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Law and Justice party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski attended the unveiling of a monument to former Polish President Lech Kaczynski, The twin brother of the ruling party leader was killed in a 2010 plane crash in Russia.\n\nThe memorial and its location in a large central square with statues and other installations representing significant moments from Poland\u2019s glorious and tragic past has been another source of national discord leading up to the independence centennial.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Raad Adayleh/Associated Press)\n\nPETRA, Jordan \u2014 The death toll from flash floods in Jordan rose to 12 on Saturday and the kingdom\u2019s main tourist attraction, the ancient city of Petra, was closed for cleanup after what local officials said was the biggest deluge in the area in decades.\n\nFriday\u2019s floods struck several areas of Jordan. Rescuers continued the search for missing people around the Wala reservoir in central Jordan on Saturday. In the southern town of Maan, authorities opened a shelter for dozens of people whose homes were surrounded by water.\n\nIn all, 12 people were killed, including two children and a diver who had been involved in rescue efforts, according to state media and Jordanian government spokeswoman Jumana Ghuneimat. Two of the bodies were found Saturday.\n\nSeparately, Israel\u2019s public radio said contact has been restored with six Israeli tourists who could not immediately be accounted for after the flooding. The Arabic-language Makan Radio said some of the tourists had been touring the Wadi Rum area, another major tourist attraction.\n\nThe torrents came two weeks after 21 people, most of them children, were killed in flash floods near the Dead Sea. The tourism and education ministers resigned over the Dead Sea flooding.\n\nIn Petra, the ancient trade hub carved into rose-hued rocks, heavy rains began at around 1 p.m. Friday and last for about 40 minutes, said Rafael Dorado, 41, a tourist from Spain.\n\nAt about 3 p.m., a torrent of water came gushing through the site\u2019s steep and narrow access canyon, flooding the area within minutes, he said. Delgado said he was observing from a hilltop temple in the area, but saw other visitors scrambling to higher ground. He said some visitors were later evacuated by trucks and others made their way out on foot.\n\nSuleiman Farajat, the chief administrator in Petra, said the site would remain closed Saturday, but would likely reopen Sunday. He said he\u2019s never seen flooding of such intensity in the area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really, I wouldn\u2019t say scary, but surprising how huge the flood was,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Fares Akram in Gaza City, Gaza Strip, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Whitaker, installed in the job by President Trump to replace Jeff Sessions, was asked in 2014, during an ill-fated run in the Republican senatorial primary in Iowa, about the worst decisions in the Supreme Court\u2019s history. Whitaker\u2019s answer, to an Iowa blog called Caffeinated Thoughts, was chilling.\n\n\u201cThere are so many,\u201d he replied. \u201cI would start with the idea of Marbury v. Madison. That\u2019s probably a good place to start and the way it\u2019s looked at the Supreme Court as the final arbiter of constitutional issues. We\u2019ll move forward from there. All New Deal cases that were expansive of the federal government. Those would be bad. Then all the way up to the Affordable Care Act and the individual mandate.\u201d\n\nReasonable people can differ over the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. Maybe there\u2019s some space to debate the New Deal-era cases that cemented the authority of the regulatory state. But Marbury? This is lunacy. For any lawyer \u2014 certainly for one now at the helm of the Justice Department \u2014 to disagree with Marbury is like a physicist denouncing the laws of gravity.\n\nDecided in 1803, at the dawn of the new republic, Marbury v. Madison is the foundational case of American constitutional law. It represents Chief Justice John Marshall\u2019s declaration that the Supreme Court possesses the ultimate power to interpret the Constitution and determine the legitimacy of acts of Congress.\n\nIn Marshall\u2019s famous words, \u201cit is emphatically the duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\u201d The untested new Constitution provided that the Supreme Court possessed the \u201cjudicial Power of the United States,\u201d but it did not define what that power entailed.\n\n\u201cWith one judgment . . . Marshall would chisel judicial review into the American system,\u201d Cliff Sloan and David McKean explain in their book, \u201cThe Great Decision.\u201d The ruling, \u201casserting clearly and unequivocally that the Supreme Court did indeed possess the power to strike down an Act of Congress as unconstitutional . . . laid the foundation for the American rule of law.\u201d\n\nThis is not a controversial position, at least in mainstream legal thought. On occasion, Supreme Court nominees, including Antonin Scalia and Neil M. Gorsuch, declined to state their agreement with Marbury. But this coyness is not because they differ with the ruling; rather, it is because they fear stepping onto the slippery slope of assessing past cases.\n\nMore commonly, Marbury is the uncontested subject of lavish judicial praise. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. endorsed it during his confirmation hearings, and expanded on that view in a 2006 C-SPAN interview. Marshall\u2019s decision meant \u201cwe have the courts to tell what [the Constitution] means and what\u2019s binding on other branches,\u201d Roberts said, \u201cand that important insight into how the Constitution works has been, I think, the secret to its success.\u201d\n\nBut if you think, as Whitaker seems to, that Roberts is too much of a squish (\u201che\u2019s not a good person to point to when it comes to actually just calling balls and strikes in practice,\u201d Whitaker said of Roberts in the 2014 interview), consider Roberts\u2019s predecessor as chief justice, William H. Rehnquist. In his book on the Constitution, Rehnquist described Marbury as \u201cthe linchpin of our constitutional law.\u201d\n\nOr consider Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s comments during his confirmation hearings, describing Marbury as among the \u201cfour greatest moments in Supreme Court history.\u201d Kavanaugh offered a more extended defense of Marbury in a 2014 Notre Dame Law Review article. \u201cIt\u2019s my submission,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote, \u201cthat Marbury v. Madison continues to mark the proper approach for constitutional interpretation.\u201d\n\nYet we seem to have, as the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer, a man who begs to differ. Is this still his position? If so, how does that view \u2014 that the court in Marbury was too assertive in exercising its power \u2014 square with Whitaker\u2019s simultaneous beef that the court was inadequately assertive in striking down laws during the later New Deal era and when dealing with the Affordable Care Act?\n\nThat\u2019s not the only troubling question about Whitaker. During a 2014 Senate debate sponsored by a conservative Christian organization, he said that in helping confirm judges, \u201cI\u2019d like to see things like their worldview, what informs them. Are they people of faith? Do they have a biblical view of justice? \u2014 which I think is very important.\u201d\n\nAt that point, the moderator interjected: \u201cLevitical or New Testament?\u201d\n\n\u201cNew Testament,\u201d Whitaker affirmed. \u201cAnd what I know is as long as they have that worldview, that they\u2019ll be a good judge. And if they have a secular worldview, then I\u2019m going to be very concerned about how they judge.\u201d\n\nMarbury was wrong. Religious tests for judges. If you thought the big worry about Whitaker was how he would handle special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, that might be just the beginning.\n\nRead more from Ruth Marcus\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook.", "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, right, shakes hands with Chinese Politburo Member Yang Jiechi at the conclusion of a news conference at the State Department in Washington, Friday, Nov. 9, 2018. (Carolyn Kaster/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 China bluntly told the United States to stop sending ships and military aircraft close to islands claimed by Beijing in the South China Sea, during talks that set the stage for a meeting between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping later this month.\n\nThe U.S. pushed back Friday, insisting it will continue to \u201cfly, sail and operate wherever international law allows.\u201d In late September, U.S. and Chinese vessels nearly collided near a disputed reef.\n\nDespite the frank airing of differences at the meeting in Washington of the two nations\u2019 top diplomats and military chiefs, both sides stressed the need to tamp down tensions, which have flared amid a bitter trade dispute that Trump and Xi are expected to tackle at the Group of 20 summit in Argentina.\n\n\u201cThe United States is not pursuing a policy of Cold War containment with China,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters following the U.S.-China Diplomatic and Security Dialogue. \u201cRather we want to ensure that China acts responsibly and fairly in support of security and prosperity of each of our two countries.\u201d\n\nThe talks were due to be held in Beijing last month but were postponed after Washington announced new arms sales to Taiwan, and after a Chinese destroyer came close to the USS Decatur in late September in what the U.S. Navy called an \u201cunsafe and unprofessional maneuver.\u201d Beijing has sweeping but disputed sovereignty claims in the area.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese side made it clear to the United States that it should stop sending its vessels and military aircraft close to Chinese islands and reefs and stop actions that undermine Chinese authority and security interests,\u201d said Pompeo\u2019s Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi, who also had sharp words over U.S. support for Taiwan.\n\nHowever, Yang and Chinese defense minister Wei Fenghe spoke of the need to improve cooperation, including between the U.S. and Chinese militaries, to ease the risk of conflict as the two powers jockey for pre-eminence in the Asia-Pacific.\n\n\u201cCooperation is the only option for us,\u201d Wei said. \u201cConfrontation and conflict between the two militaries will spell disaster for us all.\u201d\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis asserted U.S. rights to freedom of navigation but also said the two sides should work together on areas of common interest. \u201cCompetition does not mean hostility. Nor must it lead to conflict,\u201d Mattis said.\n\nAlthough the rescheduling of the dialogue signaled an effort by the two sides to contain the slide in the relationship, it did not address the core dispute on trade. Trump has slapped tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products, in a push to narrow the U.S. trade deficit and push back against what the U.S. views as predatory Chinese tactics on the high technology industry. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on $110 million worth of U.S. goods.\n\nYun Sun, a China expert at the Stimson Center think tank, said Beijing is uncertain about what exactly Trump wants out of a trade deal, but hopes that with U.S. midterm elections out of the way, the mercurial American president may be more inclined to reach a compromise. \u201cTheir top priority is to stabilize relations,\u201d she said.\n\nOn human rights, Pompeo voiced concern over China\u2019s treatment of religious minorities, including the mass detention of minority Uighur Muslims. But overall, the tone of the U.S. officials\u2019 public comments was milder than that of the Chinese. Yang insisted that Chinese people have freedom of religion, and that \u201cforeign countries have no right to interfere.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

They didn\u2019t torture them, Abu Ammar said, but started threatening to kill them as time passed.\n\nAt least two women and one man died in captivity, including a woman who was shot by the extremists to pressure authorities in negotiations for the captives\u2019 release.\n\nAbu Ammar\u2019s husband said she looked frail.\n\n\u201cSometimes they fed us once every two days and other times twice every day,\u201d Abu Ammar said, adding that it was mostly just olive oil, thyme and jam.\n\n\u201cThey held us first in a camp then a cave and kept moving us from one place to the other,\u201d she said.\n\nAbu Ammar said she didn\u2019t know about the killed hostages until they were liberated.\n\nSix other hostages, two women and four children, had been freed in an exchange with the government in October.

The military is expected to have the vast majority of the more than 7,000 troops planned for the mission along the border deployed by Monday, and that number could grow. (Gregory Bull/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation to deny asylum to migrants who enter the country illegally, tightening the border as caravans of Central Americans slowly approach the United States. The plan was immediately challenged in court.\n\nTrump invoked the same powers he used last year to impose a travel ban that was upheld by the Supreme Court. The new regulations are intended to circumvent laws stating that anyone is eligible for asylum no matter how he or she enters the country. About 70,000 people per year who enter the country illegally claim asylum, officials said.\n\n\u201cWe need people in our country, but they have to come in legally,\u201d Trump said Friday as he departed for Paris.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and other legal groups swiftly sued in federal court in Northern California to block the regulations, arguing the measures were illegal.\n\n\u201cThe president is simply trying to run roughshod over Congress\u2019s decision to provide asylum to those in danger regardless of the manner of one\u2019s entry,\u201d said ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt.\n\nThe litigation also seeks to put the new rules on hold while the case progresses.\n\nThe regulations go into effect Saturday. They would be in place for at least three months but could be extended, and don\u2019t affect people already in the country. The Justice Department said in a statement the regulations were lawful.\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement was the latest push to enforce a hard-line stance on immigration through regulatory changes and presidential orders, bypassing Congress, which has not passed any immigration law reform. But those efforts have been largely thwarted by legal challenges and, in the case of family separations this year, stymied by a global outcry that prompted Trump to retreat.\n\nOfficials said the asylum law changes are meant to funnel migrants through official border crossings for speedy rulings instead of having them try to circumvent such crossings on the nearly 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) border. The U.S. Border Patrol says it apprehended more than 50,000 people crossing illegally in October, setting a new high this year, though illegal crossings are well below historical highs from previous decades.\n\nBut the busy ports of entry already have long lines and waits, forcing immigration officials to tell some migrants to turn around and come back to make their claims. Backlogs have become especially bad in recent months at crossings in California, Arizona and Texas, with some people waiting five weeks to try to claim asylum at San Diego\u2019s main crossing.\n\n\u201cThe arrival of large numbers ... will contribute to the overloading of our immigration and asylum system and to the release of thousands ... into the interior of the United States,\u201d Trump said in the proclamation, calling it a crisis.\n\nAdministration officials said those denied asylum under the proclamation may be eligible for similar forms of protection if they fear returning to their countries, though they would be subject to a tougher threshold. Those forms of protection include \u201cwithholding of removal\u201d \u2014 which is similar to asylum, but doesn\u2019t allow for green cards or bringing families \u2014 or protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture.\n\nHomeland Security officials said they were adding staffing at the border crossings to manage the expected crush, but it\u2019s not clear how migrants, specifically families, would be held as their cases are adjudicated. Family detention centers are largely at capacity. Trump has said he wanted to erect \u201ctent cities,\u201d but nothing has been funded.\n\nThe U.S. is also working with Mexico in an effort to send some migrants back across the border. Right now, laws allow only Mexican nationals to be swiftly returned and increasingly those claiming asylum are from Central America.\n\nTrump pushed immigration issues hard in the days leading up to Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, railing against the caravans that are still hundreds of miles from the border.\n\nHe has made little mention of the issue since the election, but has sent troops to the border in response. As of Thursday, there were more than 5,600 U.S. troops deployed to the border mission, with about 550 actually working on the border in Texas.\n\nTrump also suggested he\u2019d revoke the right to citizenship for babies born to non-U.S. citizens on American soil and erect massive \u201ctent cities\u201d to detain migrants. Those issues were not addressed by the regulations. But Trump insisted the citizenship issue would be pushed through.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re signing it. We\u2019re doing it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe administration has long said immigration officials are drowning in asylum cases partly because people falsely claim asylum and then live in the U.S. with work permits. In 2017, the U.S. fielded more than 330,000 asylum claims, nearly double the number two years earlier and surpassing Germany as highest in the world.\n\nMigrants who cross illegally are generally arrested and often seek asylum or some other form of protection. Claims have spiked in recent years and the immigration court backlog has more than doubled to 1.1 million cases in about two years, Syracuse University\u2019s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse reported this week. Generally, only about 20 percent of applicants are approved.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many people en route to the U.S. will even make it to the border. Roughly 5,000 migrants \u2014 more than 1,700 under the age of 18 \u2014 sheltered in a Mexico City sports complex decided to depart Friday for the northern city of Tijuana, opting for the longer but likely safer route to the U.S. border.\n\nSimilar caravans have gathered regularly over the years and have generally dwindled by the time they reach the southern border, particularly to Tijuana. Most have passed largely unnoticed.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Elliot Spagat in San Diego, Nomaan Merchant in Houston and Jill Colvin and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said early Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, it had \u201crequested cessation of inflight refueling\u201d by the U.S. for its fighter jets after American officials said they would stop the operations amid growing anger over civilian casualties from the kingdom\u2019s airstrikes. (Hani Mohammed, File/Associated Press)\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 The Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said early Saturday it had \u201crequested cessation of inflight refueling\u201d by the U.S. for its fighter jets after American officials said they would stop the operations amid growing anger over civilian casualties from the kingdom\u2019s airstrikes.\n\nThe decision by the U.S. to pull out also comes amid outrage by U.S. lawmakers from both political parties over the Oct. 2 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.\n\nThe Saudi acknowledgement, and later U.S. comments, appeared aimed at suggesting the kingdom was behind the decision. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who launched the Yemen war as the kingdom\u2019s defense minister in March 2015, faces widespread international criticism for the war and after members of his entourage allegedly took part in Khashoggi\u2019s slaying.\n\n\u201cWe support the decision by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, after consultations with the U.S. government, to use the coalition\u2019s own military capabilities to conduct inflight refueling in support of its operations in Yemen,\u201d U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said in a statement. \u201cThe U.S. will also continue working with the coalition and Yemen to minimize civilian casualties and expand urgent humanitarian efforts throughout the country.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear what impact the U.S. withdrawal from air refueling operations would have. American officials earlier said Saudi forces now handled some 80 percent of their refueling operations, which crucially allow aircraft to fly longer sorties over possible targets and can ease the pressure for quick strikes.\n\nYet even with that refueling support, Saudi Arabia has faced widespread international criticism over its campaign of airstrikes in the coalition\u2019s war in Yemen, targeting Shiite rebels known as Houthis who hold the capital, Sanaa.\n\nSaudi strikes have hit public markets, hospitals and other nonmilitary targets, killing scores of civilians. One such Saudi-led airstrike in August in Yemen\u2019s Saada province hit a bus and killed dozens of people, including schoolchildren wearing backpacks. Human rights groups have found fragments of American-made munitions after several of these strikes.\n\nU.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity Friday to discuss the decision before its announcement, said the end to refueling wouldn\u2019t stop American training and military assistance. The Post first reported the Trump administration\u2019s desire to end the refueling.\n\nThe Saudi statement, carried early Saturday on the state-run Saudi Press Agency, did not acknowledge the Trump administration\u2019s discussions and pressure for its withdrawal.\n\n\u201cRecently the kingdom and the coalition has increased its capability to independently conduct inflight refueling in Yemen,\u201d the statement read. \u201cAs a result, in consultation with the United States, the coalition has requested cessation of inflight refueling support for its operations in Yemen.\u201d\n\nIt also said it hoped upcoming United Nations sponsored talks \u201cin a third country\u201d would help end the war. U.N. special envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths has said he is consulting with Yemen\u2019s warring parties to finalize details for a new round of peace talks. However, Griffiths\u2019 effort to revive peace talks in September fell through after the Houthis failed to attend, arguing they didn\u2019t have guarantees for their safe return.\n\nNews of the halt to U.S. refueling operations was swiftly dismissed by the Houthis as a media ploy that came in response to international pressure on Washington and Riyadh over the Yemen war.\n\n\u201cWe have one clear demand and that is a complete halt to Saudi airstrikes,\u201d said one Houthi official who spoke to The Associated Press on Saturday on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media. \u201cIf there is a halt to the airstrikes, then we can proceed to political negotiations.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, intense fighting near the Red Sea port city of Hodeida continued over the weekend, with stepped up airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition pounding Houthi positions. On Saturday, the sound of large explosions east and north of Hodeida rocked the city as coalition forces tried to take the town of al-Saleh northeast of the city where they are meeting stiff resistance.\n\nThe Houthis maintain that their forces are holding their ground and deny losing territory to the coalition-led ground forces.\n\nThe pullout from refueling comes amid new American efforts to force an end to a conflict described as the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. Yemen, the Arab world\u2019s poorest country, has stood on the brink of famine and faced disease outbreaks in a conflict that has killed at least 10,000 people.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE view the war as a means to limit Iranian influence in the Arabian Peninsula. While Iran directly denies arming the rebels, the United Nations and Western powers have documented arms transfers to the Houthis by Tehran of everything from Kalashnikov assault rifles to the ballistic missile technology used to periodically target cities as far away as the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh. The Houthis also have imprisoned opponents and indiscriminately laid land mines.\n\nBoth Mattis and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have pushed for a cease-fire in recent days. Saudi and Emirati forces, as well as their allies on the ground, have made a renewed push for the Houthi-held Red Sea port city of Hodeida, through which most food and aid enters Yemen. International aid agencies warn any disruption to the port could sever that crucial lifeline.\n\n\u201cHodeida is at risk of being obliterated,\u201d said Mohamed Abdi of the Norwegian Refugee Council. \u201cWe are now warning that by allowing this to go on, parties to the conflict and their international backers will be responsible for the death, injury and suffering of millions of people.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Lolita Baldor and Matthew Lee in Washington and Ahmed al-Haj in Sanaa, Yemen contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Thousands of Central American migrants were back on the move toward the U.S. border Saturday, after dedicated Mexico City metro trains whisked them to the outskirts of the capital and drivers began offering rides north. (Marco Ugarte/Associated Press)\n\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 Thousands of Central American migrants were back on the move toward the U.S. border Saturday, after dedicated Mexico City metro trains whisked them to the outskirts of the capital and drivers began offering rides north.\n\nAt the Line 2 terminus, migrants began making their way to a main highway to resume walking and hitchhiking with the tacit approval of Mexican officials.\n\nNear a major toll plaza about 19 miles (30 kilometers) north of the city, Mexico state police and human rights officials helped load men, women and children onto eighteen-wheelers and asked passing buses and trucks if they would carry migrants.\n\nMaria Yesenia Perez, a 41-year-old who left La Ceiba, Honduras nearly a month ago with her 8-year-old daughter, said she was prepared to wait to gain entry at the U.S. border.\n\n\u201cI decided to come (with the caravan) to help my family,\u201d she said, before she and her daughter were hoisted onto the back of a semitrailer.\n\nPerez is now one of roughly 4,000 migrants who plan to proceed to the city of Queretaro \u2014 a state capital 124 miles (200 kilometers) to the northwest \u2014 and then possibly to Guadalajara, Culiacan, Hermosillo and eventually Tijuana on the U.S. border.\n\nWhereas migrants like her carried tiny knapsacks with bare essentials in Mexico\u2019s tropical south, however, their belongings swelled noticeably after a multiday stop in Mexico City.\n\nMany are now hauling bundles of blankets, sleeping bags and heavy clothing to protect against colder temperatures in the northern part of the country. Some left the capital with bottles of water and clear plastic bags of bananas and oranges for the long trek. Others were given juice and ham sandwiches from volunteers as they set out.\n\nAstrid Daniela Aguilar, who was traveling with two cousins aged 3 and 4, lined up alongside the highway to await a chance at hitching a ride.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t find work there,\u201d she said of her home country of Honduras.\n\nThe caravan became a campaign issue in U.S. midterm elections and U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of over 5,000 military troops to the border to fend off the migrants. Trump has also insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\n\nMany migrants say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, and they have now been on the road for weeks.\n\nThe longest leg of the journey still lay ahead.\n\nOn Thursday, the U.N. rejected a demand by caravan representatives for buses to the border, saying its agencies were \u201cunable to provide the transportation demanded by some members of the caravan.\u201d\n\nMexico City is more than 600 miles from the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas, but the area around the Mexican border cities of Reynosa, Matamoros and Nuevo Laredo is rife with drug gangs and the migrants consider it too risky.\n\nMigrants are now taking a still perilous, but somewhat safer and longer route to Tijuana in Mexico\u2019s far northwest, across from San Diego.\n\nMexico has offered refuge, asylum or work visas to the migrants, and its government said 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them while they wait for the 45-day application process for a more permanent status.\n\nBut most vowed to continue to the United States.\n\nGiselle Owen, a 15-year-old from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, belted out romantic ballads as the day\u2019s journey got underway.\n\n\u201cIt relaxes me and I feel like I don\u2019t get tired,\u201d she said. \u201cI can walk hours singing.\u201d\n\nOthers got ahead by taking rides from friendly Mexicans.\n\nAngelica Martinez saw David Rodriguez pushing his friend Rafael Peralta of San Pedro Sula, Honduras down the side of the highway in a wheelchair.\n\nShe stopped in a lane of the highway to load the two migrants and the wheelchair into her small Volkswagen hatchback and said she would take them as far as she was going up the road.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Maria Verza contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Turkey says Khashoggi was strangled and dismembered at the consulate in Istanbul by a 15-member assassination squad, including agents close to the prince.\n\nMembers of Congress have been calling for the administration to curtail arms sales to Saudi Arabia or take other action. And with the election handing control of the U.S. House to the Democrats, it becomes more likely that some retaliation against Saudi Arabia would gain traction on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe refueling decision, which was first reported by The Washington Post, has been under discussion for a few weeks.

He said that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were taking adequate measures to minimize civilian deaths.\n\nMattis has made similar remarks, saying American influence on the Arab air campaign has made a difference in reducing instances of errant bombing and the targeting of civilians.\n\nIn Friday\u2019s statement, he said, \u201cThe U.S. will also continue working with the Coalition and Yemen to minimize civilian casualties and expand urgent humanitarian efforts throughout the country.\u201d\n\nThe coalition has come under heavy criticism for its relentless airstrikes since 2015, which U.N. experts say have caused the majority of the estimated 10,000 civilian deaths in the conflict and could constitute a war crime. Several strikes in recent months have killed dozens of children.\n\nMattis in August noted that U.S. support was conditioned on a Saudi commitment to doing \u201ceverything humanly possible\u201d to avoid any loss of innocent life and Riyadh supporting a U.N.-brokered peace process to end the civil war.\n\nThe U.S. has provided the Saudis and their UAE coalition partners with intelligence, aerial refueling and military advice, but U.S. forces are not directly involved in the airstrikes or other aspects of the fighting.\n\nIn the last month, the UAE has mounted an all-out offensive to capture the critical Yemeni port of Hodeida.\n\nThe conflict has plunged Yemen into a humanitarian crisis.\n\nAccording to experts, more than 22 million people in are in desperate need in what is already the Arab world\u2019s poorest country. The experts documented 6,475 deaths from March 2015 until last June, but said the real figure is likely to be significantly higher.

Hong/AP)\n\nIan David Long was a gifted sprinter whose fast-twitch muscles propelled him around the Newbury Park High School track. But one day during his senior year, each time he passed the girls\u2019 head coach, he hurled invective in her face.\n\nAnd each time, Dominique Colell yelled back. \u201cAnother mile,\u201d the young coach demanded, penalizing Long for each curse word.\n\n\u201cHe owed me 13 miles in one day,\u201d she said.\n\nLater that year, Colell said, Long assaulted her.\n\nThe coach found a cellphone and was searching through the contacts in hopes of identifying its owner when Long lunged. He screamed at her to hand over the phone and grabbed her stomach and buttocks, she said.\n\n\u201cOn my track field, students were going to be held to a standard,\u201d Colell said. \u201cEverybody went with it but him. I never recall [another] student cussing me or groping me.\u201d\n\nLong\u2019s defiance frightened Colell so much that she prayed he would stay away from the girls on the team and was relieved to see him graduate and join the Marines.\n\nShe thought little about him until she turned on the news this week to hear authorities say the student athlete turned machine-gunner had shown up at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, Calif., with a handgun and killed 12 people before turning the gun on himself.\n\n[The 12 lives lost in the California bar shooting]\n\n\u201cThey said his name, and I was like, \u2018What! Oh my God, it had to be him,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cIt was total shock and not shock at all.\u201d\n\nRelatives had questioned whether Long had returned from a tour in Afghanistan with post-traumatic stress disorder. But some who knew him in high school say his aggressive behavior predated his years in the military.\n\nEvelynn Cluke, who oversaw the relay teams at Newbury Park High School and witnessed Long assaulting Colell, recalled troubling signs in \u201ca good kid with an explosive temper.\u201d\n\nHe would get into fights if he was defied, she said, yelling at her if she told him he would not run a particular leg in a relay.\n\n\u201cI had to tell him to go sit down, go do something else or go home,\u201d she recalled.\n\nCluke believes Long had specific problems with women.\n\n\u201cHe would sit in a circle of guys and talk about so-and-so chick. . . . \u2018She doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s missing,\u2019 \u201d Cluke recalled.\n\nHer father, then the school\u2019s sprint coach, would sometimes alert her to Long acting out.\n\n\u201cIan\u2019s at it again,\u201d she remembered her father telling her. \u201cKeep an eye on him at practice.\u201d\n\nOne day, Cluke recalled, the students were allowed to park next to the track. Long, she said, pulled up in his truck and several boys gathered around.\n\nOne of the younger boys, she said, came over and told her that Long had brought a gun to school. Cluke said she went to find her father to investigate, but Long took off before they could establish whether it was true.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing we could do,\u201d Cluke said. \u201cNone of us adults had seen it.\u201d Long, she said, was admonished for missing practice.\n\nHis outbursts shocked those who witnessed them. Although Long achieved his ambition of joining the Marines, serving from 2008 until 2013, he ended up earning their opprobrium.\n\nGen. Robert B. Neller, the commandant of the Marine Corps, posted condolences to the victims of the shooting on Twitter, calling the attack a \u201ctragic & senseless act of violence\u201d and took the unusual step of referring to Long as an \u201cex-Marine\u201d \u2014 a phrase often considered an insult among veterans, who believe their fellowship continues after they leave active duty.\n\n\u201cThat ex-Marine\u2019s despicable actions run counter to what the vast majority of veterans are rightfully known for: serving w/ honor then making positive contributions to society,\u201d Neller wrote.\n\nDuring a New Year\u2019s Eve party in 2011, Long was so drunk and angry that he broke a fellow Marine\u2019s nose, according to Todd Stratton, a high school friend who was also a survivor of the shooting at Borderline Bar & Grill. He described Long as a \u201chothead.\u201d\n\nThe other Marine was trying to calm Long down, Stratton said, when Long took a swing at him.\n\n\u201cHe was just pissed off and drunk and was trying to get in a fight,\u201d said Stratton. \u201cNo one knew why he was getting so upset.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe he killed my friends and he was my friend too,\u201d said Stratton who lost four close friends in the shooting.\n\nStratton said he thought that Long \u201chad started mellowing out recently. He didn\u2019t seem as angry or aggressive.\u201d\n\nWhy Long targeted the bar remains a \u201creal mystery\u201d to Stratton, who also said Long was \u201ca big guy, 6-foot-2, over 200 pounds \u2014 there was no way anyone was gonna stop him.\u201d\n\nThe violence in Thousand Oaks \u2014 where the victims included an 18-year-old who had just started college, a sheriff\u2019s deputy who rushed in to confront the shooter and a Navy veteran who survived last year\u2019s mass shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas \u2014 echoed previous mass shootings throughout the country.\n\nAuthorities had encountered Long just months before the attack, drawing parallels to massacres in a Parkland, Fla., high school; a Sutherland Springs, Tex., church; and an Orlando nightclub.\n\n[Thousand Oaks gunman had \u2018several contacts\u2019 with police over the years]\n\nIn April, police were called to Long\u2019s home and found him \u201csomewhat irate, acting a little irrationally,\u201d so they called for a crisis intervention team and a mental-health specialist, Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean told reporters. That team \u201cmet with him, talked to him and cleared him,\u201d and did not feel they could take him into custody under what\u2019s known as a 5150 order, Dean said.\n\nUnder a 5150 order, a person who is deemed to be \u201ca danger to others, or to himself or herself\u201d can be taken into custody for up to 72 hours \u2014 and that would have barred Long from legally owning or possessing firearms under California law.\n\nThe gun he used in the attack was purchased legally, authorities said.\n\n\u201cUnder federal law and in most states, having a temporary hold of that nature does not lead to a prohibition of gun rights,\u201d said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. \u201cSo California is more the exception than the rule by having these short-term mental-health holds, 5150 holds, lead to firearm prohibitions.\u201d\n\nAn FBI examination of 63 active shooters between 2000 and 2013 found that most of them obtained their firearms legally. These people had typically shown multiple \u201cconcerning behaviors\u201d noticed by people around them before they often attacked places familiar to them, the FBI review found.\n\nInvestigators say Long appears to have posted messages on social media during the rampage in the bar.\n\n\u201cWhile he was inside the bar, and in between volleys of shots, apparently, based on the time stamps, he was posting on Instagram,\u201d said Sgt. Eric Buschow of the Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nBuschow said he did not have details about what was said in the messages, which Instagram \u2014 owned by Facebook \u2014 took down from public view but saved for authorities.\n\nBuschow said the investigation would look at \u201cevery social media\u201d avenue to try to determine motive and the shooter\u2019s mind-set. Mass shootings are often followed by a search for answers about what could have motivated the bloodshed. In some cases, answers remain out of reach; more than a year after a gunman in Las Vegas killed 58 people, his motive remains a mystery.\n\nLong appears to have set lofty ambitions for himself. In a post on an online network for special operations forces, a person named \u201cIan\u201d (who served in the same places and at the same times as Long) told the community he wanted to join the elite 75th Ranger Regiment. Years earlier in high school, he told friends that he had plans to become a professional baseball player.\n\nA game he played in May 2007, his junior year, ended those dreams. At that point, friends say Long was a somewhat withdrawn but hard-working young and athletic high school student.\n\n\u201cBack when I knew him, he was a pretty normal guy,\u201d said Cameron Forbes, another baseball player who currently lives in Orange County. \u201cI remember him being funny and having a good sense of humor.\u201d\n\nThe Newbury Park High School Panthers had made it to the California Interscholastic Federation playoffs where they faced strong adversaries in the Hart High School Indians.\n\nOn that mid-May day, future Major League player Trevor Bauer had a memorable start for Hart. Mike Montgomery, now with the Chicago Cubs, replaced Bauer on the mound for the final inning. With the score at 2-1, Long picked up his bat to pinch-hit for the Panthers.\n\nHe struck out.\n\n\u201cIt was a big game loss,\u201d said Scott Drootin, one of the coaches, who recalled a dejected Long, hanging his head in the team dugout.\n\nIt was the last out of the game \u2014 and the last game Long played for Newbury Park. After he graduated, Long didn\u2019t return to cheer on the varsity team or joke around with his former coaches.\n\n\u201cHe was one of the kids that never came back,\u201d Drootin said, who this week began looking back on the personal baseball page Long had assembled.\n\nLong listed his favorite movie as the thriller about the hijacked 9/11 plane, \u201cUnited 93.\u201d His goal, he wrote, was to \u201cwin CIF in Angel Stadium.\u201d\n\nAnd in response to a question about what he planned to do \u201cAfter baseball,\u201d Long entered a one-word answer:\n\n\u201cDeath,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDan Lamothe, Julie Tate, Rob Kuznia and Dave Sheinin contributed to this report.", "\n\nPresident Trump points to CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta during a White House news conference Wednesday.

Officials would lie with a straight face, but even Chinese apparatchiks did not sink to the depths that press secretary Sarah Sanders did this past week by sharing a doctored video of an allegedly aggressive Acosta.\n\nAs someone who had my press credentials denied by China, an authoritarian country, I never thought I would see the United States revoke a reporter\u2019s entry to the White House. America is not China, but comparisons don\u2019t have to be perfect for them to be useful.\n\nThe White House is employing strategies I\u2019m more familiar with outside of the United States. It has painted Acosta as uncommonly aggressive, an outlier whom the rest of the press corps should not respect. The image of the out-of-line reporter was the exact narrative Chinese state media propagated about me when I was expelled. It is a tactic and a powerfully effective one because the best kind of propaganda has a shred of truth to it. There is no doubt Acosta has repeatedly challenged the president, and, yes, he has interrupted Trump. Their skirmish Wednesday was hardly the first. Grasping onto this, the White House has spun it into an Acosta caricature, casting suspicion not only on his reporting but also his very person.\n\nWhen a powerful government \u2014 whether it\u2019s China or the United States \u2014 assassinates the character of someone, everything that person does is suddenly called into question. Those sympathetic to this administration already despise Acosta, but for those confused and uncertain, they may reason that, surely, he must have done something wrong. I understand this because that was China\u2019s method, too. Writing about me, one of the country\u2019s mouthpieces, the Global Times, said, \u201cIf a foreign reporter cannot stay in China, we can only assume that he or she has done something [to] cross the line.\u201d\n\nThat whiff of suspicion follows you wherever you go, as I found out when I learned that Chinese diplomats would mention me when running through their talking points, telling visiting media delegations what an emotional and belligerent wreck I was (you can see here, also an obviously gendered sketch).\n\nIn my thread on Twitter earlier this week, I warned where this could go: The administration singles out Acosta today, but can go after other journalists tomorrow. I am reminded of the Chinese idiom, \u201ckilling the chicken to scare the monkeys,\u201d meaning to make an example out of someone to deter others. It was on many fellow reporters\u2019 lips when I exited China, and I see parallels here. How will the White House correspondents react? My feeling is that journalists must hang together, or else they\u2019ll hang apart.\n\nI am disappointed at some of the pieces that my peers have written about the Acosta affair. From Poynter to the BBC, they have focused more on the exchange and how Acosta ought to have conducted himself rather than the revocation of his credentials. I agree the moment wasn\u2019t Acosta\u2019s best. But the United States is supposed to be a country with a free press, and that includes crabby journalists.\n\nWhat concerns me is how quickly we will move on from this incident. We have been in a period of what researcher Tim Dixon calls the \u201cexhausted majority\u201d for some time now. This, too, I saw in China \u2014 ordinary people with busy lives, with little energy left to worry about their government leaders.\n\nPeople wonder how one billion people can live in an authoritarian state. The uncomfortable reality is that these countries look and feel a lot like democracies. You don\u2019t experience daily oppression. You can still buy your daily Starbucks, take your trips to the movies and go on park outings with your family. Of course, as a journalist, part of my job was to observe what happened when the state did touch normal lives, and to report on the heartbreaking consequences of unreliable or broken legal and political structures on powerless people.\n\nI cannot emphasize enough how far apart the United States and China are politically. Yet, I know I am not alone among foreign correspondents who find our overseas experience suddenly more instructive when we observe some of the developments happening domestically.\n\nIn China, what I witnessed outraged me. I used the outrage as fuel for my challenging reporting work. But that trauma had its toll on me. Now I see this outrage in the United States, and I wonder how weary American reporters must be and, in turn, how tired the country must collectively feel. Will reporters and citizens, bit by bit, disconnect? I feel as if the stakes are too high to surrender, though fair warning for those who dig their heels in: You will all emerge a little scarred, a little damaged after this.\n\nRead more:\n\nMargaret Sullivan: Words and walkouts aren\u2019t enough.

(Philip Cheung/For The Washington Post)\n\nIn a 24-hour span, Sgt. Eric Buschow worked two tragedies and slept no more than two hours.\n\nA public information officer for the Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Buschow responded late Wednesday to a shooting at Borderline Bar and Grill that killed 12 people. He worked the scene all day, as the FBI arrived and the victims\u2019 names became public, before finally going to bed at 7 p.m. Thursday.\n\nTwo hours later, he was awake again. The raging Woolsey Fire, which started that afternoon and rapidly grew, had crept too close to his family\u2019s home. They were forced to evacuate.\n\nThousand Oaks is grappling with dual tragedies that struck within hours of each other, taking on more trauma and grief than a place could or should bear. After the shooting at Borderline, a popular country music bar, many residents said they stayed up late, waiting to hear news. They went to bed physically and emotionally exhausted Thursday, only to be waked in the middle of the night by the blare of emergency alerts from their phones and frantic knocks at the door from neighbors. They needed to get out, they were told.\n\n\u201cAny one of these incidents would be a significant problem at any time,\u201d Buschow said, \u201cbut to have them actually all converge at once is just unprecedented for us.\u201d\n\nThis city of nearly 130,000 people is large enough to feel big, but small enough where many people are familiar faces. Red Spanish roofs top homes and shopping centers in this family-friendly city, which has dozens of parks and playgrounds.\n\nOn Friday, the normally picturesque town was surrounded by smoke.\n\nBuschow and his family had to sleep in a car parked in a community college parking lot. The fire threatened many of the evacuation shelters nearby, and hotels across Thousand Oaks were full of reporters and area residents seeking safety.\n\nWhen the sun came up, his wife and children returned to their house \u2014 which survived the fire \u2014 and he went to work.\n\nHundreds of personnel from more than 30 law enforcement agencies across the state have converged in the Thousand Oaks area, first to help with the shooting, then with the fires.\n\n[They survived Las Vegas. Then came a second mass shooting.]\n\nThe FBI was there to investigate the shooting in a scene described as one from hell. The agency\u2019s effort was complicated by fears that wildfire debris and smoke might contaminate evidence from the shooting.

(Philip Cheung/For The Washington Post)\n\nThere are concerns that the fire could burn toward the bar. Buschow said law enforcement was looking into ways to mitigate the risk, and there is a contingency plan to keep the scene and the agents who are working it safe.\n\nAfter working all day Thursday, the FBI agents retired to their hotel in nearby Agoura Hills, only to be evacuated as the Woolsey Fire, one of several wildfires burning in Southern California, raged toward them. The agents fled, Buschow said. They had nowhere to go, so they also slept in their cars.\n\n\u201cBut you know what? At 5 a.m., they were back at the Borderline doing their work,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the fires jumped Highway 101, a main thoroughfare that connects communities throughout the valley, clogging transportation arteries and delaying for hours the first responders who had been sent in to relieve people like Buschow.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely been chaotic. Nonstop chaos,\u201d Buschow said.\n\n[The 12 lives lost in the California bar shooting]\n\nHe added, \u201cWe also have a funeral to plan for a fallen sergeant.\u201d Sgt. Ron Helus, a 30-year veteran of the sheriff\u2019s office, was among those killed at the bar.\n\nAbout three miles from the Borderline, officials had to repurpose the Thousand Oaks teen center. On Thursday, it was where relatives and friends of people missing at Borderline were told whether their loved ones were among the 12 who were killed. People cried and hugged and prayed. A man told the world through sobs that his beloved son was dead and that his last words to his child were, \u201cSon, I love you.\u201d Members of the clergy streamed in the front doors, and a small therapy horse shuffled between the bar and center.\n\nAbout 12 hours later, the complex reopened its doors, this time to house residents fleeing the wildfire. A gymnasium was filled with green cots. A woman on oxygen lay on one of the cots, a dog by her side. People wore green masks to protect themselves from the smoke. Others helped themselves to water and food: muffins, granola bars, fruit, croissants and blueberry scones.\n\nAt the senior center next door, a group of mostly elderly residents sat at long tables and watched television.

At night, her phone buzzed : She needed to evacuate her condo complex. Her husband and son were at work and her daughter was at college in Northridge, a Los Angeles neighborhood that is about 35 miles northeast.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Witkoski said through sobs.

The Borderline is one of the few places in the area where people under 21 can go out at night.\n\nHerbert said she had been sending hourly text messages on Thursday to a friend who escaped the shooting. On Friday, she felt the urge to help the wildfire evacuees.\n\n\u201cWhat are the odds of that happening, a fire right after the shooting?\u201d Herbert said. \u201cThe first responders had to deal with the loss of those innocent teenagers and then they have to deal with the fire.

Sri Lanka\u2019s President Maithripala Sirisena dissolved Parliament and called for elections on Jan. 5 in a bid to stave off a deepening political crisis over his dismissal of the prime minister that opponents say is unconstitutional. (Eranga Jayawardena/Associated Press)\n\nCOLOMBO, Sri Lanka \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s president has dissolved Parliament and called for elections on Jan. 5 in a bid to stave off a deepening political crisis over his dismissal of the prime minister that opponents say is unconstitutional.\n\nAn official notification signed by President Maithripala Sirisena announced the dissolution of Parliament effective midnight Friday. It said the names of candidates will be called before Nov. 26 and the new Parliament is to convene Jan. 17.\n\nSri Lanka has been in a crisis since Oct. 26, when Sirisena fired his prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and replaced him with former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa. Both say they command a majority in Parliament and had been expected to face the 225-member body on Wednesday after it was suspended for about 19 days.\n\nForeign Minister Sarath Amunugama told The Associated Press on Saturday that the president dissolved Parliament due to the need to go to the people to find a resolution to the crisis.\n\nHe said that on Wednesday \u201cthere was to be a lot of commotion and unparliamentary activities sponsored by the speaker.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe speaker was not planning to act according to the constitution and standing orders of Parliament,\u201d Amunugama said.\n\nSirisena\u2019s supporters had been irked by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya\u2019s announcement that he was going to call for a vote for either party to prove their support.\n\n\u201cThe dissolution clearly indicates that Mr. Sirisena has grossly misjudged and miscalculated the support that he might or could secure to demonstrate support in the Parliament,\u201d said Bharath Gopalaswamy, director at U.S.-based analyst group Atlantic Council\u2019s South Asia Center. \u201cAt the end of the day, he is a victim of his own homegrown crisis.\u201d\n\nWickremesinghe has insisted that his firing is unconstitutional. He has refused to vacate his official residence and demanded that Parliament be summoned immediately to prove he had support among its members.\n\nJayampathy Wickramaratne, one of Sri Lanka\u2019s foremost constitutional law experts and a member of Parliament representing Wickremesinghe\u2019s United National Front coalition, said he and other coalition delegates met with the chairman of Sri Lanka\u2019s Election Commission on Saturday and urged him not to take action toward the snap elections decreed by the president on Friday.\n\nWickramaratne said that President Sirisena has cited a general clause in Sri Lanka\u2019s constitution stating that the president has the power to summon or suspend Parliament. But Wickramaratne said a specific clause in the 19th amendment, added in 2015, stipulates that the president can only dissolve Parliament after 4 1/2 years, or earlier if requested by two-thirds of Parliament.\n\n\u201cYou cannot read the constitution in one provision in isolation \u2014 you have to read it as a whole, especially when amendments have been brought,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cbefore the 19th amendment, the president could dissolve Parliament at will after one year. The amendment will have been negated if this absurd argument is allowed to succeed.\u201d\n\nHowever, Wijayadasa Rajapaksa, another constitutional expert and Wickremesinghe\u2019s justice minister who alongside Wickramaratne spearheaded the introduction of the 19th amendment, said the president was empowered to dissolve Parliament to avoid stalemate situations.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to a stalemate situation or a constitutional deadlock, the president is obliged to take measures to avoid a conflict situation and political instability. Therefore, he has been compelled to take this decision and dissolve Parliament and he has the authority to do that,\u201d said Rajapaksa, who is not related to the newly named prime minister.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister. Sirisena has also accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, a charge Wickremesinghe repeatedly denied.\n\nSirisena was critical of investigations into military personnel accused of human rights violations during Sri Lanka\u2019s long civil war against a Tamil separatist group, which ended in 2009. Rajapaksa, who ruled as president from 2005 to 2015, is considered a hero by the ethnic Sinhalese majority for winning the conflict. But he lost a re-election bid in 2015 amid accusations of nepotism, corruption and wartime atrocities.\n\nWickremesinghe\u2019s camp is likely to contest Sirisena\u2019s move because of constitutional provisions stating a Parliament can\u2019t be dissolved until 4 1/2 years after its election. The current Parliament was elected in August 2015.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally unconstitutional,\u201d said Harsha de Silva, a member of Wickremesinghe\u2019s United National Party and a former government minister. \u201cSirisena has relegated the constitution to toilet paper. We will fight this dictator to the end.\u201d\n\nThe party said in a Twitter message that it will meet the elections commissioner to discuss the constitutionality of Sirisena\u2019s move.\n\nThe U.S. State Department tweeted that it is deeply concerned by news that the Sri Lanka Parliament will be dissolved, \u201cfurther deepening the political crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a committed partner of Sri Lanka, we believe democratic institutions and processes need to be respected to ensure stability and prosperity,\u201d the statement said.\n\nEarlier, U.S. Rep. Eliot Engel, the top-ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and two other lawmakers wrote to Sirisena warning that actions circumventing the democratic process could impact U.S. assistance \u2014 including a planned five-year aid package from the Millennium Challenge Corporation worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n\u201cWe fear that recent actions, if not corrected, will threaten your country\u2019s democratic development and derail the progress made in recent years,\u201d the three lawmakers said in a letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Krishan Francis in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Emily Schmall in New Delhi and Matthew Pennington in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, human rights groups, and some government leaders have called for an independent probe into the Oct. 2 killing of the Washington Post columnist at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul where he had gone to get papers so he could marry his Turkish fiance. The United States called Monday for a \u201cthorough, conclusive and transparent\u201d investigation at the Geneva-based Human Rights Council.\n\nTurki said in a speech and question-and-answer session at the International Peace Institute think tank that he expects the kingdom to live up to its promise to investigate and \u201cput all of the facts on the table\u201d and answer all outstanding questions, including what happened to Khashoggi\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cThe kingdom is not going to accept an international tribunal to look into something that is Saudi, and the Saudi judicial system is sound, it is up, it is running, and it will take its course,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kingdom ... will never accept foreign interference in that system.\u201d\n\nIn doing this, Turki said, Saudi Arabia is following other countries that have refused to allow international tribunals to investigate acts that happened on their soil or elsewhere by their citizens. He cited the abuse of prisoners by American troops and CIA staff at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq following the 2003 U.S. invasion which the United States investigated.\n\nTurki said Khashoggi was the Saudi embassy spokesman when he was ambassador to the United States and Britain, and they had been \u201cvery friendly over the years.\u201d He described Khashoggi\u2019s death, citing a verse from the Quran. \u201cIt says that the killing of an innocent man is like the killing of all of humanity. His death falls into that category,\u201d Turki said.\n\nSaudi Arabia had insisted for weeks after Khashoggi disappeared that he had walked out of the consulate, before changing its account to say he died in a brawl. Last month, Saudi Arabia acknowledged that Turkish evidence indicates that Khashoggi\u2019s killing was premeditated, shifting its explanation in an apparent effort to ease international outrage over the death.\n\nTurkey says Khashoggi, who was critical of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was strangled and dismembered at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 by a 15-member assassination squad. Media reports have suggested that his body could have been chemically dissolved.\n\nSaudi officials characterize the killing as a rogue operation carried out by Saudi agents who exceeded their authority. Yet some of those implicated in the killing are close to the crown prince, including a member of the prince\u2019s entourage on foreign trips who was seen at the consulate before Khashoggi\u2019s slaying. And crown prince Mohammed\u2019s condemnation of the killing has failed to ease suspicions that he was involved.\n\nTurkey is seeking the extradition of 18 suspects who have been detained in Saudi Arabia, so they can be put on trial in Turkey. They include the 15 members of the alleged \u201chit squad.\u201d\n\nPrince Turki, who is chairman of the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies, said his view is that there was no attempted cover up.\n\nRather, he said, what was reported to Saudi authorities was \u201cmisleading\u201d because \u201cthose who perpetrated the crime wanted to hide what had happened and to justify what they had told the authorities.\u201d\n\nHe accused the media of seeking \u201csensation\u201d and of \u201claying accusations\u201d about the crown prince \u201cwithout a fact,\u201d and based on \u201cpure speculation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is you can never hide the truth \u2014 and the kingdom will never attempt to hide the truth, not just on this situation but on other situations,\u201d he said.\n\nHe reiterated that the final report \u201cwill lay out exactly what happened and answer all of these questions that have been speculated about and made into tremendous issues.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Now, with a handful of races still to be called, it\u2019s clear that an anti-President Trump force hit the country with considerable, if uneven, strength.\n\nDemocrats appear poised to pick up between 35 and 40 seats in the House, once the last races are tallied, according to strategists in both parties. That would represent the biggest Democratic gain in the House since the post-Watergate election of 1974, when the party picked up 49 seats three months after Richard M. Nixon resigned the presidency.\n\nRepublicans will gain seats in the Senate, but with races in Florida and Arizona still to be called, their pre-election majority of 51 seats will end up as low as 52 or as high as 54. Meanwhile, Democrats gained seven governorships, recouping in part losses sustained in 2010 and 2014, and picked up hundreds of state legislative seats, where they had suffered a virtual wipeout in the previous two midterm elections.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 gains this week are still far short of what Republicans accomplished in their historic victories of 1994 and 2010. But they would eclipse the number of seats Democrats gained in 2006, the last time the party recaptured control of the House, as well as the 26-seat gain in 1982, when the national unemployment rate was at 10 percent. This year, the election took place with the unemployment rate at just 3.7 percent.\n\nDay by day, the outlook for Democrats in the House has improved. At the offices of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, already high spirits have been rising all week as more races fell into the party\u2019s column. One joke that has been making the rounds there goes like this: \u201cThis is actually turning out to be more of a Hanukkah than a Christmas election,\u201d meaning day after day of gifts, rather than just one.\n\nThis was always an election that would test the strength of the economy, which favored the president\u2019s party, vs. the president\u2019s low approval ratings, which, along with the record of past midterm elections, pointed to Democratic gains. In the end, history and presidential approval combined to give Democrats control of the House by what appears to be a comfortable margin.\n\nThe Democratic wave hit hardest in suburban districts, many of them traditional Republican territory, where college-educated voters \u2014 particularly women \u2014 dissatisfied with the president backed Democratic challengers. Ronald Brownstein of the Atlantic and CNN, who has closely tracked these changes over many elections, noted in a post-election article that, before the election, two-thirds of Republicans represented congressional districts where the percentage of the population with college degrees was below the national average. After the election, he estimated, more than three-quarters of GOP House members now will represent such districts.\n\nDemocrats flipped about two-thirds of the competitive districts won by both Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Barack Obama in 2012 or by Clinton in 2016 and Mitt Romney in 2012. They also picked up one-third of districts won by Trump in 2016 and Obama in 2012. In districts where both Trump and Romney had won in the previous two elections, Democrats gained about a quarter of the competitive seats.\n\nAlso striking in House races was the number of narrow victory margins \u2014 on both sides. About 20 Democrats won or are leading in races where the margin is fewer than five percentage points, while about two dozen Republicans who won or are leading are in races with similarly small margins.\n\nThat indicates that the outcome in 2018 could have been substantially better for Democrats or significantly worse, had the political winds been blowing differently. It also foreshadows another fiercely contested election for the House in 2020.\n\nThe final outcome in the Senate races this year will also have a bearing on 2020. The difference between a majority of 54 seats or 52 seats would have a sizable impact on the odds of Democrats being able to win control two years from now.\n\nRepublicans expect to defend 22 seats up for election, compared with only 12 seats held by Democrats. These include the Colorado seat of Sen. Cory Gardner (R), the Maine seat of Sen. Susan Collins (R) and the Arizona seat now held by Sen. Jon Kyl (R). Senate Republicans Joni Ernst of Iowa and Thom Tillis of North Carolina are likely to face competitive races. Democrat Doug Jones of Alabama, who won a special election last year, also will face a serious challenge to hold his seat.\n\nBeyond the tally of victories and defeats, the 2018 election was notable for the ways in which it deepened many of the divisions and shifts in allegiance that are changing the political landscape across the country. That carries implications for politics in 2020 and beyond.\n\nDemocratic strategists have been cheered by exit polls that show the underlying national demographic trends that drove their gains, particularly in the border states of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.\n\nVoters under the age of 29 voted for Democrats over Republicans by 67 percent to 32 percent, a margin which beats the previous record in the 2008 presidential election. Latino voters matched their national 11 percent vote share from the higher-turnout 2016 election, with Democrats winning 69 percent of the Latino vote nationwide, slightly more than the 66 percent share when Trump was elected. Asian voters, who make up about 3 percent of the voting population, sided with Democrats by a margin of 77 percent to 23 percent.\n\n\u201cThe emerging electorate, the one which will dominate U.S. politics for the next generation or two, supported Democrats in record numbers,\u201d said Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist. \u201cDemocrats not only won the 2018 election handily, but won it in a way which should worry Republicans about 2020.\u201d\n\nSaid Republican pollster Whit Ayres: \u201cTo me, the big story is that the 2018 midterm election reinforced and accelerated the patterns we saw in 2016. You had smaller, overwhelmingly white, rural counties become more deeply entrenched in the Republican Party, and suburban counties, particularly those with high proportions of well-educated voters, going exactly the opposite direction.\u201d\n\nNew returns have been raising Republican concerns in western states. Chuck Coughlin, a Republican adviser to former Arizona governor Jan Brewer (R), said it was clear that Trump\u2019s approach to immigration in the final weeks of the campaign did not have the nuance required for a state like Arizona, where immigrants play a central role in the economy.\n\n\u201cOne thing is for certain, that the caravan rhetoric doesn\u2019t resonate in this state as well as it resonates in the Midwest,\u201d Coughlin said. \u201cWe have done a lot of research, and we have consistently shown that border security is a big issue, but the immigration reform side of that question is integral to the future of the state.\u201d\n\nRepublicans in the state, however, have been hemmed in by Trump\u2019s support among Republican primary voters, which forced Rep. Martha McSally, the Republican nominee for Senate, to tack to the right, particularly on immigration. \u201cShe didn\u2019t ever modulate,\u201d said Coughlin. \u201cShe didn\u2019t create any separation.\u201d Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, the Democratic Senate nominee, now has a narrow lead in that race.\n\nIn neighboring Colorado, Democrats won every statewide race, picked up a House seat, took control of the state Senate, and swept most down-ballot races as well. \u201cWe are not Ohio, Michigan or the Midwest. The college-educated suburban voter \u2014 they don\u2019t like Trump because of his behavior,\u201d said Dick Wadhams, the former chairman of the state GOP.\n\nIn Nevada, Democrats picked up a Senate seat and the governorship and held on to two competitive House districts, in a sign of a continued shift left in what has been a closely contested state in most recent elections.\n\nDemocrats fell short in two other evolving Sun Belt states. In Texas, Democratic Rep. Beto O\u2019Rouke lost the Senate race to incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz but managed to win 48 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, Democrats picked up two suburban congressional districts.\n\nIn Georgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams trails Republican Brian Kemp in the gubernatorial race, but the changing dynamics of voting patterns there worry some Republicans for future elections.\n\n\u201cWhen you have someone like Stacey Abrams carrying a major Atlanta suburban county like Gwinnett, like Hillary Clinton did, then the formula for Republican victories in Georgia has been completely upended,\u201d Ayres said.\n\nOther results point in a different direction, however, which offers some encouragement to Republicans beyond adding to their narrow Senate majority.\n\nOhio appears to be moving steadily away from the Democrats, largely because of cultural issues. Since 1994, Republicans have won nearly nine of every 10 statewide contests. The GOP\u2019s victory in the open gubernatorial race on Tuesday was the latest blow for the Democrats, though Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown held his seat.\n\nDemocrats also failed to pick up the governorship in Iowa, though they gained two House seats. They struggled to make inroads in House races in Republican strongholds such as Kentucky, North Carolina and Nebraska.\n\nFlorida remains a top concern heading into the 2020 elections, when the state will probably play a crucial role in any path for Trump to win a second term. Contrary to the Latino vote elsewhere in the country, the Cuban, Puerto Rican and Central American populations in the Sunshine State split more evenly, as Gov. Rick Scott (R) mounted an aggressive outreach effort.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats underestimated just how much Hispanic support Republicans were able to capitalize on in Florida,\u201d said Fernand Amandi, a Democratic pollster in Miami. \u201cIt\u2019s about the margins.\u201d\n\nOf the 15 percent of voters in the state who were Latino, Scott was able to win 45 percent, according to exit polls, including a slight majority of Latino men. The Republican gubernatorial candidate, former congressman Ron DeSantis, was able to win 44 percent of Latino voters.", "President Trump distanced himself Friday from acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker amid intensifying scrutiny of the controversial legal views and business entanglements of the president\u2019s pick to run the Justice Department and assume control of the Russia investigation.\n\nWith the White House scrambling to manage public examination of Whitaker\u2019s background and resistance to his leadership within the Justice Department, Trump sought to douse speculation that he had installed the partisan loyalist to curtail the probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump insisted that he had not spoken with Whitaker about the investigation being led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III \u2014 and the president upbraided a reporter when she asked whether he wanted Whitaker to rein in Mueller. \u201cWhat a stupid question,\u201d he said.\n\nDefiant and testy as he departed the White House on Friday morning for a weekend visit to Paris, Trump claimed four separate times that he did not personally know Whitaker, who had been serving as chief of staff at the Justice Department.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Matt Whitaker,\u201d Trump told reporters, adding that he knew him only by reputation.\n\nThat claim is false, according to the president\u2019s past statements as well as the accounts of White House officials \u2014 one of whom laughed Friday at Trump\u2019s suggestion that he did not know Whitaker.\n\nTrump and Whitaker have met in the Oval Office several times, and Whitaker briefed Trump when the president preferred not to talk to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whom he had disparaged publicly, according to White House officials. As Trump said last month on Fox News Channel, \u201cI know Matt Whitaker.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Trump was aware that Whitaker was a skeptic of the Mueller probe before appointing him, which factored into his decision to tap him over Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, according to two White House advisers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid.\n\n[Whitaker has said he could not support \u2018secular\u2019 judicial nominees and that courts should be \u2018inferior branch\u2019]\n\nMeanwhile, Whitaker\u2019s public record is drawing fresh scrutiny. That includes comments during his unsuccessful 2014 campaign in Iowa for U.S. Senate that judges should have a \u201cbiblical view,\u201d that he could not support judicial nominees who are \u201csecular\u201d and that he thinks federal courts are supposed to be the \u201cinferior branch\u201d of the government. Whitaker has criticized the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark 1803 ruling in Marbury v. Madison, which serves as the foundation for judicial review of public policy.\n\nFederal investigators last year also looked into whether Whitaker, as an advisory-board member of a Miami patent company accused of fraud by customers, played a role in trying to help the company silence critics by threatening legal action.\n\n\n\nDemonstrators in Lafayette Park, outside the White House, on Thursday. (Michael Reynolds/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nBut it is Whitaker\u2019s outspoken criticism of the Mueller investigation that has led Democrats to allege bias and spurred bipartisan efforts on Capitol Hill to pass legislation designed to protect the special counsel and prohibit Trump from firing him.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Friday that she is \u201cconcerned\u201d about Whitaker\u2019s comments about Mueller and the parameters of his investigation. She called for legislation that stipulates the special counsel could be fired only \u201cfor good cause and in writing\u201d \u2014 and only by a Senate-confirmed Justice Department official, which Whitaker is not.\n\n\u201cSenate debate and passage of this bill would send a powerful message that Mr. Mueller must be able to complete his work unimpeded,\u201d Collins said in a statement.\n\nDelivering the Democratic Party\u2019s weekly address, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said, \u201cA functioning democracy requires Democrats and Republicans to come together to take action next week to protect special counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t, and Donald Trump is given license to shut down an investigation into his own potential wrongdoing, then our nation starts to devolve into a banana republic,\u201d Murphy said in his speech, which was released Friday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) predicted Whitaker would be \u201ca very interim AG\u201d and said his chamber would not consider legislation to protect Mueller, because \u201cit isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Mueller investigation is not under threat,\u201d McConnell told reporters Friday in Frankfort, Ky. \u201cThe president has said repeatedly he\u2019s not going to dismiss the Mueller investigation.\u201d\n\nThe cascade of events was set in motion Wednesday, the day after the midterm elections, when Trump forced Sessions to resign after complaining bitterly for more than a year that Sessions had not sufficiently protected him from the Mueller investigation.\n\nIn replacing him, Trump passed over Rosenstein, who had been overseeing the Russia probe and who White House advisers say the president does not fully trust. Instead, Trump tapped Whitaker, who as a legal commentator opined extensively about the Russia probe.\n\nWhitaker said on CNN that he could envision a scenario where Sessions was replaced and his successor \u201cjust reduces [Mueller\u2019s] budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\u201d He also wrote in an online column for CNN \u2014 under the headline \u201cMueller\u2019s investigation of Trump is going too far\u201d \u2014 that the president was \u201cabsolutely correct\u201d to suggest that Mueller would be crossing a red line by examining the finances of Trump and his family.\n\n[Trump\u2019s new acting attorney general once mused about defunding Mueller]\n\nMeanwhile, an audio recording has circulated online in which Whitaker expresses doubt about any Russian inference in elections at all. \u201cThe left is trying to sow this theory that essentially Russians interfered with the U.S. election, which has been proven false,\u201d Whitaker said. \u201cThey did not have any impact in the election.\u201d\n\nThat statement directly conflicts with the conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election to help elect Trump and the Justice Department\u2019s indictments of more than two dozen alleged Russian agents for interference.\n\nInside the Justice Department, there is considerable resistance to Whitaker, and some officials there say they think he is wholly unqualified to be acting attorney general.\n\nMany in the building are concerned about infighting, noting that while Whitaker was serving as chief of staff to Sessions he spoke privately with Trump about taking over as attorney general and did not disclose the conversation to Sessions. A person familiar with the matter said Sessions was surprised when The Washington Post first reported on Whitaker and Trump\u2019s discussion.\n\nWhitaker also had been seen as gunning for Rosenstein\u2019s job, which created awkwardness among the department leadership, officials said.\n\nAt the White House as well as the Justice Department, senior aides were taken aback by news accounts of Whitaker\u2019s work on the advisory board of Miami-based World Patent Marketing, which was accused of defrauding its customers. Officials said they were particularly stunned by emails showing Whitaker invoked his former job as a U.S. attorney to threaten a man who had complained about the company.\n\nWhitaker also rebuffed an October 2017 subpoena from the Federal Trade Commission seeking his records related to the company, according to two people with knowledge of the case.\n\n[Whitaker promoted company accused of deceiving clients]\n\nAlso under scrutiny is Whitaker\u2019s work as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Iowa. In one of its most publicized cases, Whitaker\u2019s office brought charges against an openly gay Democratic state senator, Matt McCoy, for allegedly using his office to extort about $2,000 from a local company that installed motion sensors in the homes of senior citizens to monitor their health.\n\nMcCoy said he believed the case was motivated because of his politics and sexual orientation, and a jury found him not guilty. A Justice Department spokesman said the case was brought on its merits, not because of politics. Still, for Whitaker, the case ended in defeat and harsh criticism in the local press.\n\nThe White House did not thoroughly vet Whitaker before Trump appointed him acting attorney general, because he was \u201calready chief of staff,\u201d according to one White House official. This official said Whitaker is unlikely to be removed from his interim post \u201cunless more comes out.\u201d\n\nInside Trump\u2019s orbit, one of Whitaker\u2019s advocates has been Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society, who has vouched internally for Whitaker\u2019s management skills and told White House officials that he would be a more decisive leader than Sessions, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nLeo did not know at the time he recommended Whitaker to be Sessions\u2019s chief of staff about his work for the suspect patent company but has stuck by the acting attorney general this week, the person said.\n\nSeeking to quell the internal concerns and public doubts that have been raised about Whitaker, Rosenstein praised his new boss in brief remarks to reporters Friday in Alexandria, Va.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s a superb choice for attorney general,\u201d Rosenstein said. \u201cHe certainly understands the work, understands the priorities of the department. I think he\u2019s going to do a superb job as attorney general.\u201d He added that he delivered the same message Thursday in a conference call with prosecutors across the country.\n\nOther officials inside the department said they viewed Whitaker as a capable and hard-charging manager who drew on his football experience to try to motivate people. Trump said Whitaker was \u201ca very strong personality \u2014 and I think that\u2019s what they need.\u201d\n\nJustice Department lawyers are bracing for the likelihood that they will face lawsuits over the constitutionality of Whitaker\u2019s appointment. A Justice Department official said lawyers feared that challengers would be able to find a judge, at least at the district-court level, who would be friendly to challenges over Whitaker\u2019s authority \u2014 whether they had merit or not \u2014 and stir further anxiety at the department.\n\nLawyers Neal K. Katyal and George T. Conway III, who have emerged as prominent critics of the Trump administration, argued in a New York Times column this week that Whitaker\u2019s appointment was unconstitutional because the appointments clause of the Constitution requires \u201cprincipal officers\u201d who report to the president be confirmed by the Senate. Some other legal scholars dispute that argument.\n\nSeizing on some of their points, however, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) wrote a letter to Trump on Friday calling Whitaker\u2019s appointment \u201cunprecedented\u201d and asking him to detail specifically why he had not let Rosenstein, who has been confirmed by the Senate, assume the role, as would have happened by default.\n\nSpeaking with reporters Friday, Trump distanced himself from Whitaker, just as he has done with other close associates \u2014 including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former personal lawyer Michael Cohen \u2014 once they become embroiled in controversy.\n\n\u201cWell, Matt Whitaker \u2014 I don\u2019t know Matt Whitaker,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMatt Whitaker worked for Jeff Sessions, and he was always extremely highly thought of, and he still is. But I didn\u2019t know Matt Whitaker.\u201d\n\nTrump went on to praise Whitaker as \u201ca very smart man,\u201d \u201cvery respected\u201d and \u201cat the top of the line\u201d \u2014 and claimed his selection to succeed Sessions \u201cwas greeted with raves.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials and outside advisers said later Friday that they were struggling to divine the meaning of Trump\u2019s assertion he did not know Whitaker.\n\n\u201cCould he be running from him? I guess it\u2019s possible,\u201d said one person close to Trump and the Justice Department. \u201cI think he\u2019s just trying to kick the can and not deal with the situation.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials said Whitaker is unlikely to be nominated as the permanent attorney general, a position that would require Senate confirmation. Trump hinted as much when he addressed reporters Friday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Trump said, adding that he is considering a number of candidates. \u201cI have some very, very good people. But, I mean, there\u2019s no rush.\u201d\n\nDevlin Barrett, Rosalind S. Helderman, Michael Kranish, Carol D.

The attack horrified hundreds of onlookers during the afternoon rush hour in Australia\u2019s second-biggest city.\n\nVictoria state Police Commissioner Graham Ashton said Shire Ali, who was shot by police and died in a hospital, had also made an \u201cunsophisticated\u201d plan for his vehicle to explode to cause many more fatalities. He had placed several barbecue gas canisters in the back of his pickup, with the outlet valves open, but they had failed to ignite.\n\n\u201cIt looks like he\u2019s attempted to ignite a fire in the car, we believe at this stage with a view to igniting those canisters with some sort of explosion, but that didn\u2019t eventuate,\u201d Ashton told reporters.\n\nShire Ali, who moved to Australia with his family from Somalia in the 1990s, was known to police and the federal intelligence authority ASIO. He had a criminal history for cannabis use, theft and driving offences, Ashton said.\n\nAustralian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Ian McCartney told a media briefing on Saturday it was believed the attack was inspired by IS, though it was thought Shire Ali had no direct links to the organization.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say he was inspired. He was radicalized, with the rise of the caliphate and the propaganda that was put out on the internet. We\u2019re not saying there was direct contact. We\u2019re saying it was more from an inspirational perspective,\u201d McCartney said.\n\nMcCartney said the incident was a \u201creality check\u201d for security agencies that \u201ceven with the fall of the (IS) caliphate ... the threat continues to be real.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said \u201cradical, violent, extremist Islam\u201d poses the greatest threat to Australia\u2019s national security.\n\n\u201cHere in Australia, we would be kidding ourselves if we did not call out the fact that the greatest threat of religious extremism in this country is the radical and dangerous ideology of extremist Islam,\u201d he said.\n\nMorrison said he had long-standing relationships with the Muslim community and it was them who had raised with him concerns about radicalism in recent years.\n\nShire Ali had family and associates who were also known to police. His brother Ali Khalif Shire Ali is currently on remand awaiting trial next year for allegedly planning an attack, Ashton said.\n\nThe Islamic State group claimed responsibility for Friday\u2019s attack but provided no evidence. It said the man was an Islamic State fighter and had responded to IS calls for attacks in countries that are part of the international coalition fighting the militants in Syria and Iraq.\n\nPolice and civilians had tried unsuccessfully to subdue Shire Ali before he was shot in the chest by a police officer, who Ashton said only graduated from the police academy three months ago.\n\nA man aged 74, who had been stabbed in the face, died at the scene. Two other men, aged 26 and 58, are in a hospital with what police describe as non-life threatening injuries.\n\nAshton also said police had searched two Melbourne properties on Saturday in relation to the attack, but that police did not believe there were any ongoing threats to the public.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time in four years Australia has witnessed militant violence.\n\nIn December 2014, a 17-hour siege in which a gunman took 18 people hostage in a Sydney cafe ended with two hostages dead and the assailant killed by police. Though the erratic gunman demanded that police deliver him an Islamic State flag at the outset of the crisis, there was no evidence he had established contact with the militant group. However, at a later inquest, the coroner of New South Wales state said the gunman\u2019s actions fell \u201cwithin the accepted definition of terrorism.\u201d\n\nMelbourne was also the scene of two fatal car-ramming incidents last year, but neither was linked by police to terrorism.\n\nAshton says there is no suggestion Shire Ali was inspired by James \u201cDimitrious\u201d Gargasoulas, who faced court this week on six charges of murder over the first ramming attack, in January 2017.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nSome veterans and mental-health advocates bristled at President Trump\u2019s comments regarding the Thousand Oaks shooter and post-traumatic stress disorder, saying such broad-based remarks risked fueling inaccurate stereotypes about the condition and Americans who have served in combat.\n\nTrump began speculating about PTSD on Friday morning when asked about the shooting, in which authorities say 28-year-old Marine veteran Ian David Long opened fire at a country-music bar in Thousand Oaks, Calif., and killed 12 people. Officers found Long inside an office in the bar, dead of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\n\u201cHe was a war veteran. He was a Marine. He was in the war. He served time. He saw some pretty bad things, and a lot of people say he had PTSD, and that\u2019s a tough deal,\u201d Trump said after describing the shooter as a \u201cvery sick puppy\u201d who had a lot of problems.\n\n\u201cPeople come back \u2014 that\u2019s why it\u2019s a horrible thing \u2014 they come back, they\u2019re never the same,\u201d the president added, referring to Long\u2019s military service.\n\nLong served as a machine-gunner in the Marine Corps from 2008 to 2013 and deployed to Afghanistan, leaving the U.S. military as a corporal.\n\nIt is not clear whether Long had been formally diagnosed with PTSD before his death or whether the president assumed he suffered from the condition based on his military service and comments in the news media by people who knew the shooter.\n\nTrump\u2019s broad-brush remarks outside the White House on Friday prompted concern that the president was amplifying stereotypes suggesting PTSD turns veterans into violent killers and that all service members come home somehow damaged from combat.\n\n\u201cComments like this one from our Commander in Chief are extremely unhelpful,\u201d Paul Rieckhoff, founder and chief executive of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said in a statement. \u201cThey perpetuate a false and damaging narrative that veterans are broken and dangerous. Most people who suffer from PTSD, when able to access effective treatment, are able to live healthy, happy, meaningful lives.\u201d\n\nRieckhoff said when veterans with mental-health issues hurt someone, it\u2019s most likely themselves, not someone else.\n\n\u201cWe lose 20 veterans and service members to suicide every single day,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t with the phrasing, \u2018you go to war and you come back and you\u2019re not the same\u2019 \u2014 that is true, you come back and you\u2019re not the same,\u201d said Kayla M. Williams, a former Army sergeant and senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. \u201cThe concern I have is the idea that you come back more likely to be a mass shooter. That is not the case.\u201d\n\nWilliams said veterans come home from combat changed often in good ways, with a greater eagerness to be engaged with their communities and their country, and while there can be correlation with PTSD and increased anger and aggression, it\u2019s unethical and dangerous to encourage Americans to be afraid of veterans because of their combat experiences and suggest they return home damaged.\n\nThe wars in Afghanistan and Iraq dramatically increased the number of young Americans who had seen combat, reviving the stereotype of the damaged veteran, with PTSD becoming an acronym well known outside medical communities.\n\nIn recent years, mental-health experts and veterans groups have taken steps to remove the stigma of the condition and show that veterans suffering from it aren\u2019t ticking time-bombs, as stereotypes stemming from the Vietnam era began to suggest.\n\n\u201cI think in reporting and in fiction movies and television, it\u2019s interesting and graphic to create an archetype, to create a particular portrait \u2014 and the idea of the crazed killer coming back from war has a certain amount of resonance. It\u2019s not true,\u201d said Frank Ochberg, clinical professor of psychiatry at Michigan State University.\n\nOchberg has advocated renaming the condition PTSI \u2014 or Post Traumatic Stress Injury \u2014 rather than describing it as a disorder. He said there is some research that shows people with PTSD have an increased risk of violence but he said that applies to a vast minority, and sometimes veterans with the condition become reclusive or see reduced appetite for enjoying time with family and friends.\n\n\u201cI think a president says let\u2019s get facts before we affirm our prejudices or assumptions and really spread rumors about what\u2019s going on here,\u201d Ochberg said. \u201cAnd then I think the president could take the occasion to say even if this veteran has PTSD, let\u2019s not stereotype veterans with PTSD as being deadly dangerous, because most of them are not.\u201d\n\nPTSD varies in features and sometimes is seen as a \u201ccommon cold\u201d of psychiatry in that some people recover on their own and others face increasing severity that requires treatment, said Elspeth Ritchie, a retired Army colonel and psychiatrist with expertise in the condition.\n\nService in combat doesn\u2019t necessarily equate with PTSD. Ritchie said data on service members who served in combat in Iraq at the height of the war suggests about a quarter came back with some symptoms of PTSD but didn\u2019t necessarily have the full-blown condition.\n\n\u201cOn the question about the relationship between PTSD and violence \u2014 like often with mental illness, there is a little bit of increased risk of violence, but it\u2019s not the kind of violence where you go into a bar and shoot people,\u201d Ritchie said.\n\nIn cases of mass shootings, she said, perpetrators are quite often suffering from a mental condition that involves delusion and paranoia, something far more severe than PTSD, even if they have served in the military and seen combat.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about going in and shooting some place up . . . nearly all of the time it\u2019s something worse than PTSD,\u201d Ritchie said. \u201cIt\u2019s usually a psychotic episode. Psychosis means being out of touch with reality.\u201d\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misquoted Elspeth Ritchie, a retired Army colonel and psychiatrist. Ritchie said: \u201cPsychosis means being out of touch with reality,\u201d not society.", "Iowa state Sen. Matt McCoy believed he was on a path to running for governor or Congress when FBI agents knocked on his door one morning in 2007. He soon learned that he was facing prosecution by a U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Iowa named Matthew G. Whitaker.\n\nThe case has now become another focus of controversy for Whitaker, who President Trump named Wednesday as acting attorney general.\n\nMcCoy said in an interview Friday that he thought that Whitaker, a conservative Republican, targeted him because he is an openly gay Democrat, a charge that Whitaker\u2019s spokesman denied.\n\nWhitaker, who served as U.S. attorney from 2004 to 2009, announced the case against McCoy with much fanfare, alleging that the senator had used his office to extort about $2,000 from a local company that installed motion sensors in the homes of senior citizens to monitor their health. Prosecutors alleged that McCoy leveraged his position as a senator to demand a $100 commission on each unit.\n\n[Federal investigators said to have scrutinized Whitaker\u2019s role in company accused of fraud]\n\nThe case was controversial from the start, in part because McCoy\u2019s attorney accused prosecutors of misconduct for failing to reveal that an informant had been paid. The judge declined McCoy\u2019s request to dismiss the case, but he did grant a continuance that enabled McCoy to find more witnesses, according to McCoy\u2019s attorney, Montgomery Brown.\n\nIn the end, the case fell apart. McCoy said he was involved in a normal business deal, and a jury agreed, acquitting him after two hours of deliberation.\n\nThe case set off a firestorm in the local media. Rekha Basu of the Des Moines Register wrote a blistering column at the time that said Whitaker\u2019s case \u201cwas based on the word of a man former associates depicted as a drug user, a deadbeat and an abuser of women; a man so shady even his Alcoholics Anonymous sponsors called him a \u2018pathological liar.\u2019 \u201d Basu noted that McCoy is a gay Democrat, while Whitaker is a Republican who \u201chas ties to the evangelical Christian community.\u201d\n\nMcCoy, in a Friday interview with The Washington Post, said the case cost him $100,000 in legal expenses and upended his life.\n\n\u201cI was a rising star in the party, and people believed that I had a future to run for governor or Congress,\u201d McCoy said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he liked gay people, and I was an outspoken Democrat,\u201d he said, when asked why he thought Whitaker brought the case.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman, who was not authorized to speak on the record, denied that Whitaker targeted McCoy for prosecution.\n\n\u201cWhitaker had a responsibility to uphold the rule of law and pursue credible allegations of illegal activity,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThe Department of Justice signed off on bringing the case, the FBI conducted an independent investigation, and career prosecutors handled the case throughout its duration. The jury\u2019s verdict does not negate the obligation of law enforcement agencies to open cases when they determine laws may have been broken.\u201d\n\nMcCoy went on to be reelected as a state senator and was just elected county commissioner, a position he begins in January.\n\nJulie Tate and Alice Crites contributed to this report.", "WASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. officials say the Pentagon is moving to stop refueling Saudi Arabian aircraft fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nVeterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie defended the agency\u2019s ongoing experiments on dogs Friday and said he would continue to \u201creauthorize\u201d them, eight months after Congress passed legislation limiting tests that are opposed by a bipartisan cast of lawmakers and several veterans\u2019 groups.\n\nSpeaking at the National Press Club, Wilkie rejected calls to end research that he said led to the invention in the 1960s of the cardiac pacemaker and the discovery in the late 1990s of a treatment for deadly cardiac arrhythmias. These days, he said, some of the testing is focused on spinal cord injuries.\n\n\u201cI love canines,\u201d Wilkie said. \u201cBut we have an opportunity to change the lives of men and women who have been terribly hurt. And until somebody tells me that that research does not help in that outcome, then I\u2019ll continue.\u201d\n\nWilkie\u2019s comments drew swift backlash from lawmakers who have criticized the experiments, which occur at three VA locations and are invasive and sometimes fatal to the dogs, as cruel and unnecessary.\n\nPresident Trump in March signed a spending bill that included language restricting such tests, and legislation has been proposed that would end all canine research at VA.\n\n\u201cHaving sustained catastrophic injuries on the battlefield, which included the loss of both my legs, I am acutely aware of the vital role dogs play in helping troops recover from war\u2019s physical and psychological tolls,\u201d said Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.), an Army veteran and co-sponsor of the legislation. \u201cThe VA has not executed what we wanted as intent, which is to bring this to an end in its entirety, so we will keep up the pressure.\"\n\nThe restrictions approved by Congress require any canine testing be \u201cdirectly approved\u201d by the secretary. Last week, USA Today reported that the agency has continued to conduct research on dogs in Milwaukee, Cleveland and Richmond. In Cleveland, the experiments involve severing dogs' spinal cords and testing their cough reflexes, the newspaper reported.\n\nAn animal rights group, the White Coat Waste Project, first drew attention to the testing in early 2017, sparking opposition in Congress and among some veterans' organizations. The VA, with the backing of other veterans' and medical groups, pushed back against the mounting criticism, with then-secretary David Shulkin, a physician, calling the research critical \u201cbecause of the distinct physical and biological characteristics humans and dogs share that other species do not.\u201d\n\nWhich VA secretary approved the ongoing testing, however, is a point of contention. Before Trump fired him in March, Shulkin told an interviewer he was \u201cnot a strong believer\u201d in the testing, and last week he tweeted that he \u201cremain[s] opposed toward any new dog research.\u201d But an agency spokesman said Friday that Shulkin had verbally approved the continuation of the research the day he was fired.\n\nRegardless of who signed off on the research, Wilkie made clear Friday that his support remained firm. He said the agency uses 92 dogs in experiments, adding: \u201cEvery day, 2,000 dogs are euthanized in this country.\u201d\n\nJustin Goodman, vice president of advocacy and public policy for White Coat Waste, said it was \u201cdisconcerting that Secretary Wilkie was brought in to clean up the VA, and yet he is doubling down on a program that has continued to fail veterans, taxpayers and dogs.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nShould dogs be guinea pigs in government research?

Perhaps 116,000 of them died in that struggle. Their commander in chief, Woodrow Wilson, did not match the quality of their service. During the conflict, Wilson made serious mistakes as a political leader that should never be forgotten.\n\nWilson\u2019s missteps in wartime were hardly his only defects. His most disgraceful flaw was his racism. Given his high-flown rhetoric as a professor about elevating humankind, Wilson especially stood out in his white supremacy. He was not a man of his time but a throwback. His two predecessors, Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, had looked far kindlier on African Americans and their rights.\n\nIn 1916, Wilson, a Democrat, narrowly won reelection, campaigning under false pretenses with the slogan \u201cHe Kept Us Out of War.\u201d Privately, however, he knew it was quite possible that he would take the nation into the European struggle soon after starting his second term.\n\nAs an academic, Wilson had emphasized the need for presidents to explain military setbacks and other complex or mystifying events to Americans. Yet he spent much of 1917, the first year of U.S. engagement in the war, in kingly isolation, rarely using his luminous oratorical gifts to explain to his countrymen why they needed to make severe sacrifices for a conflict that wasn\u2019t an obvious, direct threat to America\u2019s national security.\n\nWilson, who preened as a civil libertarian, persuaded Congress to pass the Espionage Act, giving him extraordinary power to retaliate against Americans who opposed him and his wartime behavior. That same law today enables presidents to harass their political adversaries. Wilson\u2019s Justice Department also convicted almost a thousand people for using \u201cdisloyal, profane, scurrilous or abusive language\u201d against the government, the military or the flag. Wilson is an excellent example of how presidents can exploit wars to increase authoritarian power and restrict freedom, some arguing that criticizing the commander in chief amounts to criticizing soldiers in the field.\n\nIn the 1918 midterms, with the Great War heading to its climax, Wilson shamelessly exploited the military struggle for domestic politics, urging voters to support his party \u201cfor the sake of the nation itself\u201d because Republicans were trying to take \u201cthe conduct of the war out of my hands.\u201d This cheap maneuver backfired. Roosevelt and Taft charged that Wilson was asking for \u201cunlimited control over the settlement of a peace that will affect them for a century.\u201d Partly out of disgust with Wilson\u2019s presumptuousness, voters switched control of both the House and Senate to the Republicans.\n\nI admire Wilson\u2019s insistence on ending the war with a League of Nations to ensure that such a conflict never happened again, but his plan to achieve it was clumsy political malpractice. He knew the Republican majority in Congress and many other Americans would be troubled by the possibility that if the Senate endorsed U.S. entry into the League of Nations, the new peace organization might have the right to call American troops into battle. Wilson should have immediately made it his central mission to assuage those fears, but he instead decamped to the Paris peace conference for months \u2014 certain, in his vanity, that no mere professional diplomat could match his negotiating skills. The domestic debate over the League of Nations was left to its loudest opponents, such as Henry Cabot Lodge, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. By the time Wilson returned in the summer of 1919, fatal damage had been done.\n\nWilson\u2019s famous failure to persuade Americans to accept his cherished league (he poignantly suffered a stroke while campaigning for it) had gargantuan consequences. It doomed the League of Nations\u2019 potential to keep the world out of an even more ruinous war, decades later, as Adolf Hitler expanded his brutal reach in Europe and Japan fell under the spell of a militant, imperial regime.\n\nIn the late 1930s, when Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to awaken Americans to the possibility that they might have to fight to save the world from tyranny, perhaps his biggest obstacle was the bitter public memory of Wilson and World War I. Laboring under the millstone of the then widely detested 28th president, FDR managed to rearm the United States only in the nick of time.\n\nOne can admire Wilson for his progressive reforms, for his idealism and eloquence about America\u2019s role in the world, as I do, without sugarcoating his displays of political incompetence as a president of war. In wartime, Americans have a right to expect that the bravery of U.S. troops is matched by brilliant political leadership in the White House. Too often in the past, World War I anniversaries have been transformed into paeans to Woodrow Wilson.

What can you do to help my campaign? he asked, according to people familiar with the meeting. Mr. Pecker, chief executive of American Media Inc., offered to use his National Enquirer tabloid to buy the silence of women if they tried to publicize alleged sexual encounters with Mr. Trump. Less than a year later, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Pecker to quash the story of a former Playboy model who said they\u2019d had an affair. Mr. Pecker\u2019s company soon paid $150,000 to the model, Karen McDougal, to keep her from speaking publicly about it. Mr. Trump later thanked Mr. Pecker for the assistance. The Trump Tower meeting and its aftermath are among several previously unreported instances in which Mr. Trump intervened directly to suppress stories about his alleged sexual encounters with women, according to interviews with three dozen people who have direct knowledge of the events or who have been briefed on them, as well as court papers, corporate records and other documents.\n\nIf this surprises you, you must not be familiar with Donald Trump.\n\n* Juliet Eilperin, Lisa Rein, and Josh Dawsey report that Ryan Zinke\u2019s days are numbered:\n\nWhite House officials have identified Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke as the Cabinet member most vulnerable to a congressional probe under a Democratic majority in January, putting the colorful secretary closer into the president\u2019s crosshairs, according to two senior administration officials briefed on the matter. The new assessment comes as President Trump is weighing whether to dismiss Zinke, according to the officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss personnel matters. Trump has told aides he will make a decision next week after he returns from Paris, they said. At the White House on Friday, he gave Zinke a tepid vote of confidence.

In total, CBP arrested or deemed inadmissible 60,745 people along the Mexico border in October, far more than any other month since Trump took office.\n\n[Meet the man behind Trump\u2019s controversial immigration ad]\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials did not comment Friday on the October figures. Trump in the past has viewed the numbers as a gauge for the performance of his border security officials and especially Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who is not expected to last much longer in her role.\n\nWith Trump arriving in France on Friday, it was not clear whether the president had seen the October border figures showing yet another surge in illegal crossings.\n\nDHS officials blame the surge on what they say is a flood of frivolous asylum claims by Central Americans attempting to avoid deportation by gaming the U.S. immigration system. Trump on Friday issued a presidential proclamation that imposes new restrictions on asylum protections for migrants who cross the border illegally, invoking the same executive authority cited under his travel ban last year.\n\nA coalition of civil rights groups led by the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit Friday in San Francisco seeking an injunction to block the measures, calling them a violation of federal procedure and a violation of immigration laws.\n\nOctober\u2019s surge in border arrests was driven, once more, by large numbers of Guatemalan and Honduran migrants, many of whom are fleeing rampant violence and poverty.\n\nAn estimated 7,000 to 10,000 Central Americans are traveling toward the U.S. border in loose caravans of unprecedented size, and the October arrest totals do not include members of those groups.\n\nThey will arrive at a border where more than 7,000 U.S. soldiers have been ordered to deploy in an attempt to deter more illegal crossings. But record proportions of those crossing illegally today are women with children who simply turn themselves in to U.S. border agents and state a fear of return.\n\nU.S. courts limit the government\u2019s ability to hold children in immigration jails, and with family-appropriate detention capacity already maxed out, the government has been processing and releasing large numbers of migrants in Arizona and California.\n\nThe last month on record that CBP registered more than 60,000 arrests and \u201cinadmissible\u201d border crossers was November 2016, the month Trump was elected.\n\nBorder apprehensions fell during the first year of Trump\u2019s presidency to their lowest level since 1971, and when the numbers rebounded this spring the president directed much of his ire at Nielsen. His administration attempted to halt the increases by separating parents from their children, but Trump abandoned the policy after six weeks amid widespread outrage.", "President Trump walks with French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, to plant a tree on the South Lawn at the White House in April.

She gets publicity and then she gets a pay raise, or she gets a contract with, I think, CNN. But she\u2019s very nasty and she shouldn\u2019t be. You\u2019ve got to treat the White House and the office of the presidency with respect.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201closer\u201d comment came two days after he admonished Ryan at a White House news conference.\n\n\u201cSit down! I didn\u2019t call you,\u201d Trump commanded after Ryan tried to ask him about alleged voter suppression in the midterm elections. \u201cSuch a hostile media, it\u2019s so sad,\u201d Trump added as Ryan pressed him. \u201cYou rudely interrupted him,\u201d Trump told her, referring to another reporter.\n\nA few moments later, Alcindor asked Trump about his recent characterization of himself as \u201ca nationalist\u201d and whether that label was \u201cemboldening white nationalists.\u201d\n\nTrump interrupted her and responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you say that, that is such a racist question.\u201d He repeated that characterization \u2014 \u201cracist\u201d \u2014 two more times.\n\nTrump has disparaged many people, so his responses to Phillip, Ryan and Alcindor might simply reflect equal-opportunity contempt.

When his supply was stolen from his car, he believed the thief was his cousin Emmitt Chandler, 19. Joey Chandler fatally shot his cousin and fled the scene, but later that night he surrendered to authorities. Convicted of murder, Chandler was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\n\nParents who have raised sons understand that civilization\u2019s primary task is to civilize adolescent males, a task that is difficult for many reasons, some of which neuroscience explains. The part of the brain that stimulates anger and aggression is larger in males than in females (for evolutionary, meaning adaptive, reasons). And the part that restrains anger is smaller in males. The Supreme Court has noted that adolescent brain anatomy can cause \u201ctransient rashness, proclivity for risk, and inability to assess consequences,\u201d thereby diminishing \u201cmoral culpability\u201d and, more important, enhancing \u201cthe prospect that, as the years go by,\u201d offenders\u2019 \u201cdeficiencies will be reformed.\u201d Hence \u201ca lifetime in prison is a disproportionate sentence for all but the rarest of children, those whose crimes reflect \u2018irreparable corruption.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNow, there is spirited disagreement among thoughtful people concerning whether such disproportion constitutes a violation of the Constitution\u2019s Eighth Amendment proscription of \u201ccruel and unusual punishments.\u201d There is disagreement concerning whether the Eighth Amendment as originally understood by those who wrote and ratified it was intended to forbid only certain methods of punishment, or to assign to courts the task of enunciating standards of proportionality in sentencing. There is disagreement about what the modern court has done in incrementally circumscribing states\u2019 discretion in punishing juveniles: It has held that the Eighth Amendment forbids capital punishment for children younger than 18. And that it forbids life imprisonment without parole for juveniles convicted of non-homicide offenses. And that it forbids \u2014 this is the issue in Chandler\u2019s case \u2014 mandatory life imprisonment without possibility of parole for juvenile homicide offenders unless they have demonstrated \u201csuch irretrievable depravity that rehabilitation is impossible.\u201d\n\nNever mind that it is difficult to imagine how a sentencing court could determine that a juvenile has manifested such depravity. Clearly, however, the Mississippi court that heard Chandler\u2019s argument for resentencing in light of Supreme Court rulings about sentencing juveniles did not seriously attempt this difficult task.\n\nWhile incarcerated, Chandler has not been a discipline problem. He has earned a GED and completed college-level coursework in Bible studies. He has earned certificates in construction trade skills and made substantial progress toward a certificate in automotive repair. Nevertheless, the resentencing court\u2019s almost flippant reasons for reaffirming Chandler\u2019s sentence to die in prison included the following:\n\n\u201cNothing in the record\u201d suggested that Chandler \u201csuffered from a lack of maturity\u201d when he shot his cousin. (Science demonstrates a physiological basis of varying maturities of male adolescents.) The 17-year-old Chandler was \u201cvery mature\u201d because he planned his crime. (His prompt surrender suggests more bewilderment than planning.) He was mature because he came from a nuclear family. (How does a family\u2019s attribute prove the existence of a different attribute in a family member?) He was mature because 17-year-olds are allowed to get driver\u2019s and pilot\u2019s licenses, and abortions, and because he fathered a child, and because in World War II a 17-year-old won a Medal of Honor.\n\nReally. And the court simply ignored the evidence of Chandler\u2019s efforts at rehabilitation.\n\nFifty years ago, many Americans thought Mississippi itself exemplified irretrievable depravity. Today, the state has more \u2014 not more relative to population, more \u2014 African Americans in elective offices than any other state. Culturally and economically, Mississippi is a vibrant participant in the American mainstream. The state\u2019s self-rehabilitation was not impossible.\n\nIn 2053, the 50th anniversary of Joey Chandler\u2019s crime, he will be 67, if he lives that long. Today, the Supreme Court should hear Chandler\u2019s case to provide standards requiring sentencing courts to be serious when making an extraordinarily serious judgment about someone\u2019s \u201cirretrievable depravity.\u201d\n\nRead more from George F.

But more than the number, the lasting significance of 2018 may be that so many women did not climb conventional ladders to get to Capitol Hill.\n\nWhile some did hold steppingstone political offices, many others took nontraditional paths to power, suggesting the need for female candidates to pay their dues in party politics may have gone the way of pantsuits and pearls.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sea change,\u201d said Stephanie Schriock, president of Emily\u2019s List, the Democratic-leaning group that supports women in politics.

But as of Friday, more than 100 women had been declared winners in the 435 House races \u2014 nearly three dozen more than are serving in the current Congress. Nearly all the newcomers are Democrats. The number of Republican women will decline when the new Congress is seated in January, potentially dropping to as few as 13.\n\nAlthough the makeup of the House will remain overwhelmingly male, the three dozen women newly elected Tuesday easily surpass the 24 female newcomers elected in 1992, the last \u201cYear of the Woman,\u201d at the end of the George H.W.

Dave Brat (R-Va.), a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.\n\nSpanberger is a mother who started a Girl Scout troop as well as an intelligence officer who speaks four languages and once recruited spies. She said voters in her Central Virginia district appreciate candidates who don\u2019t fit the standard mold of a politician.\n\n\u201cWe are breaking up the typical,\u201d Spanberger said. \u201cYou can tell a child they can be anything they want, but until they see a broad spectrum of the country \u2014 someone who looks like them \u2014 they feel one step apart.\u201d\n\nSpanberger said she would work to make health care more affordable and to heal the nation\u2019s political divisions. \u201cWhat motivated me to run was how divisive the political rhetoric had become,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was a common message among other Democratic women who knocked off Republican incumbents, including another CIA veteran, former Middle East analyst Elissa Slotkin. Slotkin unseated Rep. Mike Bishop in a central-Michigan district that President Trump won easily in 2016.\n\n\u201cPeople can disagree and still respect each other,\u201d Slotkin said.\n\nIn addition to driving the Democratic takeover of the House, female candidates also claimed four governorships for Democrats, flipping the top office in Michigan, Kansas, Maine and New Mexico.\n\nRepublican women won gubernatorial races in Alabama, Iowa and South Dakota and posted a few other milestones. Rep. Marsha Blackburn will move from the House to the Senate, becoming the first female senator from Tennessee. And Young Kim, who had served in the California statehouse, appeared headed for a win in a close House contest and on the threshold of becoming the first Korean American woman in Congress.\n\nRushton said Republicans are actively recruiting and training women for office. There is value, she said, in \u201cstep by step\u201d advancement. She said droves of Democratic women with zero political background ran for office this year and many failed because voters wanted people with some experience.\n\nBut many Democratic women won, buoyed by anger and frustration among female voters over the country\u2019s direction under Trump.\n\nIn California, Katie Hill, who ran a nonprofit group that provides services for the homeless, defeated a Republican incumbent, Rep. Steve Knight, in the San Fernando Valley.\n\nIn Georgia, former flight attendant Lucy McBath also beat an incumbent, Rep. Karen Handel (R). McBath, whose 17-year-old son was fatally shot by a white man who complained he was playing music too loudly, ran as a gun-control advocate.\n\nAnd in Massachusetts, Ayanna Pressley became the first black woman elected to Congress from that state, beating Rep.

And the crowd roared.", "The Trump administration is ending the practice of refueling Saudi-coalition aircraft, halting the most tangible and controversial aspect of U.S. support for the kingdom\u2019s three-year war in Yemen, U.S. and Saudi officials said.\n\nThe move comes amid escalating criticism of Saudi Arabia\u2019s conduct in the war. Lawmakers from both parties have demanded that the United States suspend weapons sales to Riyadh and cut off aerial refueling of aircraft flown by the Saudi-led coalition, which monitoring groups have accused of killing thousands of unarmed civilians.\n\nHours after The Washington Post reported a decision had been made, the Saudi and American governments issued statements confirming a halt to the refueling program.\n\nDefense Sec. Jim Mattis said the Pentagon supported the Gulf kingdom\u2019s decision \u201cto use the coalition\u2019s own military capabilities to conduct inflight refueling in support of its operations in Yemen. We are all focused on supporting resolution of the conflict.\u201d\n\nThe Saudi Press Agency said the coalition, led by Riyadh and including a number of mostly Arab nations, had \u201crequested cessation\u201d of the refueling due to its own increasing ability.\n\nAnalysts said the move would limit Saudi Arabia\u2019s ability to conduct bombing missions.\n\n\u201cThis marks the first time that the United States has taken a concrete measure to rein in the Saudi war effort,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA officer who is now a scholar at the Brookings Institution. \u201cTwo administrations have basically given the Saudis a blank check to do whatever they wanted. Now it will be harder for the Saudis to carry out airstrikes deep into Yemeni territory, going after the capital, for instance.\u201d\n\n[Hundreds of thousands of Yemenis trapped as fighting escalates in strategic port city]\n\nThe decision is expected to have a lesser effect on the air operations of the United Arab Emirates, another coalition member whose sorties are flown from just across the Red Sea in Eritrea. The UAE government has said its air operations primarily target al-Qaeda militants rather than Houthi rebels. The coalition launched its operations against the rebels in 2015 because it feared their rise would give Iran a foothold on the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nThe announcement comes as Yemeni forces supported by the coalition recently announced a new offensive to capture the Houthi-controlled port city of Hodeida. Aid officials warn that an urban battle there could imperil hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nThe U.S.-Saudi relationship has come under closer scrutiny since Saudi Arabia acknowledged that its agents killed Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi journalist, last month. Democrats, bolstered by a string of midterm election victories in the House, have also called for greater oversight of the war.\n\nThough U.S. military officials have continued to publicly defend the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s efforts to avert civilian casualties, privately they have expressed a feeling of being stuck between a rock and a hard place. U.S. military leaders, many of whom have years of experience working closely with Persian Gulf allies, see Saudi Arabia as a key partner in the counterterrorism fight that has dominated Pentagon operations since 2001. They also share Riyadh\u2019s concern about Iran\u2019s reach through proxy forces and want to show support for the kingdom as it grapples with repeated missile and other attacks from the Houthi rebels.\n\nBut the officials are also frustrated that they are blamed for atrocities in a conflict in which they believe they have a minor supporting role and which they often have little ability to shape. U.S. air tanker activity represents only about a fifth of overall refueling activity for the coalition\u2019s campaign over Yemen, according to the Defense Department.\n\nThe decision to halt refueling occurs as the Trump administration seeks to throw its support behind efforts by the U.N. envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, to initiate discussions that might lead to a peace deal. Griffiths had hoped to bring the Houthis together with representatives of Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government this month but, in an acknowledgment of the challenge negotiators will face, he now hopes to do so by the end of the year, U.N. officials said Thursday.\n\nCritics say the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to foster a peace process is undermined by its failure to exert adequate pressure on Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cThe United States has the clout to bring an end to the conflict \u2014 but it has decided to protect a corrupt ally,\u201d Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a senior Houthi official, said in an opinion article in The Washington Post.\n\nOn Friday, Sens. Todd C. Young (R-Ind.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) renewed their calls for a suspension of U.S. refueling in a war that has killed at least 10,000 people. \u201cWe must send an unambiguous, immediate, and tangible message that we expect Riyadh to engage in good faith and urgent negotiations to end the civil war,\u201d the lawmakers said in a statement. \u201cRiyadh must also understand that we will not tolerate the continued indiscriminate airstrikes against civilians and civilian infrastructure that have helped put 14 million Yemenis on the verge of starvation.\u201d\n\nU.S. military officials have said their refueling program seeks to enable defensive missions conducted by coalition planes \u2014 targeting a Houthi site, for example, from which a missile is thought to have been launched into Saudi Arabia \u2014 but acknowledge that they do not track what occurs once those planes have been refueled. In March, Army Gen. Joseph Votel, head of U.S. Central Command, told Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) that U.S. forces did not track whether U.S. fuel or munitions had been used in coalition operations that resulted in civilian deaths.\n\nWarren condemned the actions of Iranian-linked forces in Yemen but said the United States must insist on accountability from Saudi Arabia, because it provides the kingdom with aid. \u201cThat means we bear some responsibility here, and that means we need to hold our partners and our allies responsible for how those resources are used,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the past, military leaders have argued that ending aerial refueling could have a dangerous effect. This spring, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said in a letter to lawmakers that legislation seeking to force an end to military support \u201ccould increase civilian casualties, jeopardize cooperation with our partners on counterterrorism and reduce our influence with the Saudis \u2014 all of which would further exacerbate the situation and humanitarian crisis.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration also shares intelligence with coalition forces and has continued to support massive arms sales, including precision-guided munitions that U.S. officials have argued enable the coalition to conduct more-precise air operations. U.S.-manufactured munitions have been found repeatedly at the sites of strikes on Yemeni civilians.\n\nU.S. military officials say Saudi Arabia has taken steps to improve its air operation, particularly after an Aug. 9 strike that killed more than 40 Yemeni children.\n\nDuring the final years of the Obama administration, the U.S. military had a more substantial footprint in the coalition air command center in Saudi Arabia. But it reduced the number of personnel there after a temporary cease-fire in 2016 and since then has sought to maintain its distance from the coalition\u2019s targeting operations.\n\nThe move to end more than three years of refueling may not satisfy critics in Congress, who would like to see broader action to curtail U.S. involvement in the war. The U.S. military conducts a separate campaign in Yemen along with Emirati forces against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether that operation would be affected by the decision.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a prominent critic of U.S. involvement in the war, said Friday\u2019s decision amounted to an admission that the Yemen campaign had been a failure.\n\n\u201cNow that it\u2019s no longer a secret that the war in Yemen is a national security and humanitarian nightmare, we need to get all the way out ,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nKaren DeYoung contributed to this report.", "NEW YORK \u2014 Prince Turki Al-Faisal, Saudi Arabia\u2019s former spy chief, says the country is proud of its judicial system and will never accept an international investigation into the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nU.N.

(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nBefore the Pittsburgh Penguins visited the Washington Capitals on Wednesday night, the Capitals announced that the proceeds the team collected from its 50/50 raffle would go to the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh. The organization is directing recovery efforts after the October shooting at Tree of Life synagogue that killed 11 people and injured seven more.\n\nIn all, fans purchased $38,570 worth of numbers. Half of that total was headed to Pittsburgh, and the other half, $19,285, was destined for the raffle winner.\n\nExcept the winner, a Capitals season ticket holder, declined to collect the money. He waived his right to the prize and donated it all to the Jewish Federation.\n\n\u201cLook, I could never write that check by myself. But it was easy. It was simple. It was the right thing to do,\u201d said the season ticket holder, who spoke to The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity so as not to divert attention from the Pittsburgh Jewish community\u2019s recovery. \u201cI don\u2019t want to distract from where the focus needs to be, which is helping those in need.\"\n\nThe raffle winner and his teenage son have had tickets to Capitals games for eight years and play the 50/50 drawing almost every game, he said. The contest is sponsored by the Monumental Sports & Entertainment Foundation, which normally picks a worthy cause to donate half the revenue.\n\nBut after the team announced the money from the drawing at the Pittsburgh game would go to the shooting victims, his son asked if he could spend some of his own money to purchase numbers and support the Jewish Federation.\n\nTogether, they contributed $100. The odds were so long that they had won, the season ticket holder did not bother to look at his numbers when the winner was announced during the third period. Only before he was set to throw his numbers away while leaving the stadium after the game did he check, just in case.\n\n\u201cSure enough, I\u2019d hit it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe filled out the paperwork to claim the prize but told Capitals staff that he just wanted to donate the winnings back. The easiest way to do that, staff told him, was to waive his right to the money, so he wouldn\u2019t have to pay taxes on the winnings and the Jewish Federation could enjoy the full $38,570. His son stood by him and agreed it was the right thing to do.\n\n\u201cWhen the shooting happened, and you\u2019ve got a teenage son who\u2019s curious about what in the world is going on, it\u2019s an opportunity to talk through things,\u201d said the season ticket holder, who is not Jewish. \u201cWe talked a lot about hate and the fact that there\u2019s no room for hate in the world. These people were shot simply because of where they worship and the fact that they might have been helping someone else. My family feels very strongly about this.\u201d\n\nThe raffle winner said in the time he has had season tickets, he has been able to teach his son a lot of \u201clife lessons,\u201d most of them owing to the Capitals' previous perennial playoff disappointments.\n\nBut he also has pointed to the way the hockey community unites after tragedies, such as the April bus crash that killed 16 members of the Humboldt Broncos junior team and injured 13 more. NHL teams banded together to raise money to pay for funerals and medical bills for the players and coaches and their families.\n\n\u201cI hope that others will take the opportunity to help out when they can however they can in their communities,\u201d the season ticket holder said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than Caps-Pens hockey and the rivalry is really intense, but it\u2019s nothing compared to tragedies like this.\n\n\u201cHockey is really great at coming together, whether it was the bus accident in Canada last year or something like this. To be a small part of something like that, it\u2019s the least we could do.\u201d", "\n\nAn industrial warehouse, right, sits on the Anable Basin in Queens, N.Y.

Entrepreneurs and policy experts say tech companies are drawn to the city\u2019s rich diversity and skilled workforce, transforming it over the past decade into a vibrant tech stronghold and expanding the industry\u2019s footprint beyond its West Coast origins.\n\n[Amazon reportedly in advanced talks about putting HQ2 in Crystal City, Va.]\n\n\u201cEducation, expertise, access to capital, access to customers, a place where people want to live.

Tech companies and their employees are attracted to the city\u2019s essential characteristics: arts and cultural institutions, neighborhoods connected by public transit, restaurants, coffee shops, and bars, Samuels said.\n\nThe city\u2019s tech industry already employs 320,000 people, according to Karen Bhatia, the vice president of initiatives at the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC). And officials have invested in preparing young people to join those ranks. The city\u2019s more than 120 colleges and universities produce 4,500 computer science majors every year, Bhatia said. \u201cWe have the talent infrastructure here in New York.\u201d\n\n[In its first print toy catalogue, Amazon bets on the classics]\n\nBoth Amazon and Google would be expanding their existing workforces in the area. Amazon has more than 2,000 employees in New York out of a global head count that exceeds 613,000. The online retail giant could eventually bring 25,000 highly paid workers to the area if it decides to build a piece of its second headquarters there.\n\nGoogle counts roughly 7,000 people in New York out of a total of more than 94,000 employees. According to the Journal report, Google is planning to add space there for more than 12,000 new employees.\n\nGoogle and Amazon declined to comment. (Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\n[After walkouts, Google agrees to step up its transparency, harassment policies]\n\nAmazon has not disclosed the job listings for its second headquarters, but the company said they would be high-paying jobs. It\u2019s likely that many of the positions are slotted for skilled computer engineers, who can earn six-figure salaries. Experts say the intense demand for technologists allows workers to command even higher wages, with top tech companies competing for the best employees, blunting the costs of living in New York.\n\nInternet entrepreneur and investor Kevin Ryan, who has founded several tech companies in New York, said people often underestimate the city\u2019s success as a tech center because it hasn\u2019t spawned a mega company on the scale of Facebook. Plus, the city\u2019s tech sector is obscured by several other world-class industries native to the area, such as finance and advertising. But investments in the New York tech scene have grown at a dramatic pace. Last year, start-ups raised $12 billion in venture capital, up 40 percent from 2016, according to the NYCEDC.\n\n\u201cNew York dominates the East Coast and will continue to dominate and continue to grow, because we have the human talent,\u201d said Ryan, the co-founder and chairman of AlleyCorp, a network of start-ups. \u201cTech companies are just people, and, unlike other industries, the people are so important that it\u2019s not about cost.\u201d\n\nWhile New York is known for its high cost of living and its strained subway system, its tech scene has not drawn the scorn of critics who point to the Bay Area\u2019s housing crisis and Silicon Valley\u2019s insular nature and singular fixation on technology.\n\n\u201cWhat really makes New York stand apart is that tech is the sixth or seventh most important thing in New York \u2014 behind music and publishing and fashion and finance,\u201d said Dennis Crowley, the co-founder and executive chairman of Foursquare. \u201cYou can do great things in tech, and still no one will know you at the cocktail party.

(Tiziana Fabi/AFP)\n\nAfter months of outcry from American Catholics this year, demanding that bishops \u2014 the highest-ranking Catholic leaders in the United States \u2014 be held accountable for decades of child abuse by priests, the bishops will meet in person for the first time for a days-long reckoning about how to address the crisis.\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the bishops will put aside almost everything else on their agenda for the annual meeting of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops next week to focus solely on rectifying their policies on abuse. The leaders of all 196 U.S. archdioceses and dioceses are invited to attend the Baltimore event.\n\nMany bishops and lay leaders hope they will emerge from the meeting with sweeping new procedures in place, including a lay commission empowered to investigate abuse by bishops, a new code of conduct and a plan for bishops removed from office because of their handling of abuse.\n\n\u201cWhen we come out of the meeting and are able to communicate what will be different moving forward, it\u2019s my hope that all those who\u2019ve been asking for such concrete steps will recognize: The bishops heard us,\u201d said Bishop Michael Burbidge, who leads Virginia\u2019s Diocese of Arlington. \u201cWe hear what you said. And we share those concerns. And we\u2019re doing something about it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a lot to get done in one meeting. But before the work begins, they will devote almost an entire day of the three-day session in Baltimore to prayer.\n\n\u201cAll prayer. No agenda items. It\u2019s just a day of prayer from morning until night. I think that shows the importance, that we recognize that we need some divine assistance here,\u201d Burbidge said.\n\nThe bishops have been a primary focus of Catholics' anger this summer and fall, starting with the release of a major grand jury report in Pennsylvania in August. That report, which investigated seven decades of church history and found that more than 300 priests in the state had abused more than 1,000 children, drew attention to the conduct of bishops, who sometimes moved an abusive priest to another parish or let him return to his ministry rather than removing him or reporting him to police.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, bishops' names have been stripped from buildings and rooms that once honored them. Many of those bishops are deceased or retired, but not all. The current bishop of Pittsburgh, David Zubik, has been involved in church administration since the late 1980s and has faced calls for his resignation since the grand jury report.\n\n[Pennsylvania diocese removes every bishop's name since 1947, since they failed to root out child abuse]\n\nDonald Wuerl, whose actions during his 18 years as bishop of Pittsburgh were scrutinized closely in the grand jury report, was the archbishop of Washington when the report came out. After months of furious pressure from parishioners and highly involved Catholics in the District and Maryland, Wuerl retired because of the condemnation of his conduct. (He remains the acting administrator of the Archdiocese of Washington, until Pope Francis selects his successor.)\n\nAcross the country, as more than a dozen states and a federal U.S. attorney have followed Pennsylvania\u2019s lead since August and opened criminal or civil investigations into the Catholic Church, concerned Catholics have focused their attention on the conduct of bishops. Many have called for the increased participation of lay leaders \u2014 people who are not ordained clergy but, instead, parishioners in the pews \u2014 to oversee the bishops' conduct. Some have raised the question of mass resignation of some of the longest-serving bishops, who have led the church since long before the U.S. dioceses reformed their policies for handling abuse of children, in light of the Boston Globe\u2019s 2002 expos\u00e9 of pervasive crimes.\n\nIn response to these calls for reform, the bishops will consider three new policies at their meeting in Baltimore.\n\nFirst, they will debate whether to create a new commission of lay people to investigate complaints against bishops. The U.S. bishops have already committed to hiring an outside vendor to run a hotline for reporting abuse, or mishandling of an abuse case, by bishops. That vendor is still being selected, but once the church signs a contract, the hotline operator will be directed to refer complaints to law enforcement when appropriate, according to U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops spokesman James Rogers.\n\nIf the bishops create this lay commission, the hotline could also funnel reports to the commission, which would make recommendations for disciplining bishops, when necessary, to the Vatican\u2019s ambassador to the United States, who would refer the complaints to the bishops' supervisors in Rome.\n\nSecond, the bishops will consider a draft that would create a new code of conduct for bishops, who currently don\u2019t have a written framework of professional ethics. Depending on the language that the bishops agree to during a two-day process of amendments and debate, the new standards of conduct could cover sexual relationships with adults and other questions of abuse of power.\n\nThis proposal is likely to provoke the most controversy among the bishops. \u201cI think the whole thing of a code of conduct for the bishops to me is unnecessary. We have a code of conduct \u2014 it\u2019s called the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It\u2019s called living a good, holy life,\" said Bishop Christopher Coyne of Vermont\u2019s Diocese of Burlington. \u201cThis is the life that we\u2019re called to live as bishops. That would be a code of conduct enough.\u201d\n\nAfter a moment of reflection, Coyne modified his view. \u201cI wish it wasn\u2019t necessary, but it is. Given what has happened in the past and has happened currently, it is.\u201d\n\nBut while some bishops are entering the meeting optimistic about voting in a full slate of new policies, Coyne said he\u2019s not sure all the proposals will survive the debate. \u201cIt\u2019s most important that we talk positively about what we have accomplished, our protection of children over the past 16 years, and we also talk about our shame and hurt and guilt we owe collectively,\" he said. \u201cI hope we\u2019re not in a worse place going out of it than we are coming in. ... I\u2019m just trying to lessen people\u2019s expectations of what can be accomplished, going into this meeting, so we don\u2019t have a huge disappointment at the end as to what was accomplished.\u201d\n\nFinally, the attendees will consider what to do with bishops who have already been, or will be, removed from their positions because of sexual misconduct or mishandling of abuse. The role of bishop is set up to be lifelong, with a promise of full financial support from the church, including an income and housing through retirement. Currently, disgraced ex-cardinal Theodore McCarrick is moving into a friary in a remote Kansas town. Wuerl\u2019s retirement housing is still being determined. West Virginia\u2019s Bishop Michael Bransfield was removed from ministry in September because of sexual misconduct allegations, and the bishops expect that other bishops could be removed for similar causes in the future.\n\nThe bishops could approve a consistent standard for such cases at the meeting, including restrictions on former bishops' permission to lead Mass and other services.\n\n[Pope Francis meets with U.S. bishops, including leader facing a new cover-up charge himself]\n\nBecky Ianni, a leader of SNAP, an advocacy group for victims of clergy abuse, said she is dubious about the bishops' efforts at reform, especially since the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops president, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, will be leading the forum. DiNardo himself has been accused of improperly handling an abusive priest in his Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hypocritical for him to lead a discussion of what to do with bishops. Is he going to come up?\u201d Ianni said. \u201cI have concerns about what it says to victims, that we have someone here who we know covered up abuse, and we\u2019re supposed to trust that he\u2019s going to do what\u2019s best for victims.\u201d\n\nShe won\u2019t be satisfied, she said, just to see a code of conduct written. She wants to see bishops \u2014 potentially dozens of them \u2014 who ever had a role in covering up abuse forced out of their positions.\n\nThe bishops will also vote on a letter condemning racism, which they began drafting after the Charlottesville demonstration of 2017 and which was expected to be the centerpiece of this meeting, had the sexual abuse crisis not taken center stage this summer.\n\nBut before it all gets started, the bishops will pray. Their meeting Monday will be chock full of ritual. Mass. Guided prayer and reflection about the grievous effects of sexual abuse. Time for confession.\n\nA full day in prayer and contemplation can be rare for busy bishops, Rogers said. \u201cWe\u2019re all very action-oriented people. It\u2019s easy to forget, leading the complex organization of a diocese \u2014 all the parishes and schools. This invites them out of the administration of the church, and into why the church is here to begin with.\u201d", "President Trump has long argued that he did not engage in extramarital affairs with adult-film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal and, further, that he knew nothing about payments intended to keep the two women quiet before the 2016 campaign. His insistence on those fronts, already crumbling in the wake of admissions under oath from his former personal attorney Michael Cohen, eroded almost entirely Friday following the release of a lengthy new report by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nOur most robust understanding of the interactions among Trump, Cohen and the National Enquirer\u2019s parent company, American Media Inc., comes from the criminal information document submitted to the court when Cohen pleaded guilty to eight counts of campaign-finance and financial crimes in July. Filling in the blanks in that document reveals the broad strokes of what the Journal reported: an agreement between Trump\u2019s team and the CEO of AMI to help shield Trump\u2019s presidential campaign from scrutiny. Two separate points of outreach by Daniels and McDougal to AMI ended up in front of Cohen, and each woman received more than $100,000 to stay quiet about her alleged relationship with Trump.\n\nBeyond some other specifics, things were murky. Determining the most important question \u2014 Did Trump violate campaign finance law with his involvement in the payments? \u2014 depended in part on details that were still missing from the story. Cohen implicated Trump while entering his guilty pleas, but there were still some shadows. The Journal report adds new details that make the case for Trump\u2019s culpability even stronger.\n\nThat\u2019s according to Lawrence Noble, former general counsel for the Federal Election Commission, who spoke with The Washington Post by phone and email on Friday. Proving a violation of campaign finance regulations in this situation would have had to include, in Noble\u2019s words, the following evidence:\n\nThat the money was paid to protect the campaign.\n\nThat the money was in excess of campaign contribution limits of $2,700.\n\nThat the money came from a prohibited source such as a corporation.\n\nAnd/or that the contribution was not properly reported.\n\nThat the violation was knowing and willful.\n\nTo prove \u201cknowing and willful,\u201d Noble said, \u201cthey have to show Trump had knowledge of the scheme and knew, generally, that the conduct was unlawful.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s assess the new details included in this Journal report in that light. The report is sourced to dozens of people and various legal documents and probably includes information from three people who cooperated with federal investigators. Incidentally, these are AMI chief executive David Pecker, Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg and Cohen.\n\nTrump initiated the request for AMI and Pecker to help run interference. The Journal report alleges that Trump initiated the conversation with Pecker in August 2015 about how AMI could aid his campaign.\n\nTrump and Pecker had been friends for a long time before that year, with AMI staffers telling the Associated Press in August that Pecker had been buying and killing (that is, not running) unfavorable stories about Trump for at least a decade. (The Journal story has this instruction going back to the 1990s.) HuffPost reported last month that AMI staffers were encouraged to gin up stories about Trump\u2019s political opponents, and to play down or skip stories casting Trump in a negative light.\n\nBefore making the McDougal payment, Pecker spoke to an election-law expert. Pecker appears to have understood that by making payments to women during the campaign he ran the risk of violating federal campaign-finance law. As we first reported in July, you are not allowed to coordinate with a candidate to spend tens of thousands of dollars to aid the candidate\u2019s campaign. If you *could*, there would be no point to campaign finance laws, because candidates could just instruct wealthy supporters to spend money wherever it was needed.\n\nThe McDougal deal, unlike the Daniels deal, included having McDougal appear on magazine covers and write for AMI publications. That, Pecker appears to have been told by his attorney, offered enough protection to the company for making the agreement.\n\nBut it may not have been. Cohen pleaded guilty to eight criminal counts in August. One derived from his role in helping AMI make the payment to McDougal.\n\nPecker balked at being reimbursed, because he didn\u2019t want to violate election law. After an audio recording of Trump and Cohen discussing the McDougal deal became public, one of the many questions that were raised was why the pair planned to reimburse Pecker for his spending. The conversation between Trump and Cohen implied that they were concerned that AMI might run the McDougal story if Pecker had been hit by a truck \u2014 in Trump\u2019s formulation \u2014 so buying the story and maintaining ownership of it in-house would offer some protection.\n\nThe plan had been to accept reimbursement from Trump for all but $25,000 of the payment, the value of McDougal's covers and columns. But Pecker, the Journal reports, was told by his attorney that a reimbursement would \u201cundermine any argument that the McDougal payment was made for editorial and business reasons, rather than as an in-kind campaign contribution.\"\n\nDaniels was paid by Cohen personally because Pecker passed and Trump stalled. Another question that emerged was why Cohen would dip into his own finances to pay off Daniels after an agreement was reached with her in October 2016.\n\nThe Journal reports that Pecker declined to get involved in that deal because \u201che didn\u2019t want his company to pay a porn star.\u201d That, it seems, was a step too far for the magazine that boosted Trump by accusing the father of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) of having been linked to the John F. Kennedy assassination. AMI did connect Daniels\u2019s attorney to Cohen, as the criminal information document makes clear.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t Trump then pay Daniels himself? Cohen, working with Weisselberg, the Trump Organization CFO, tried to figure out a way to shield the payment from any connection to Trump. That effort delayed the payment, and with Daniels reportedly shopping her story around to another outlet, Cohen drew money from his home equity line of credit to make the payment. (That home equity line of credit, he admitted in August, was itself obtained fraudulently.)\n\nThe urgency of that payment was reinforced in a three-way call between Cohen, Pecker and Dylan Howard, an AMI executive based in New York, the Journal reports.\n\nTrump himself was involved directly in each deal. Trump reportedly called Pecker after AMI tipped off Cohen about the McDougal story. Cohen came to Trump again in October 2016 when the Daniels story emerged, with Trump reportedly telling him to \u201cget it done.\u201d\n\nAll of these points, these new details, bolster the idea that Trump himself was involved in violating campaign finance law, according to Noble.\n\n\u201cFor the candidate to be found liable for a violation, generally you have to show that the candidate was specifically involved in the violation and knew about the violation,\u201d Noble said. \u201cWhen you can show that the candidate knew about the violation or knew about the activity that led to the violation \u2014 and especially when you can show that they did it to avoid it looking like it was a violation \u2014 then I think you do have evidence that the candidate was involved and the candidate can be held liable.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the several of the examples above.\n\nThat Trump reportedly initiated the relationship with AMI predicated on the campaign: \u201cHe is a candidate. And if he is doing it for election-related purposes \u2014 and I think the evidence is very strong that he was, then he is personally liable for this,\u201d Noble said.\n\nThat the payments to bury the stories happened at a distance from Trump, shielding him from a connection to them out of an apparent awareness of the need to keep them secret: \u201cWhen somebody makes an effort to hide what they\u2019re doing in a campaign context,\u201d he said, \u201cthat is at least evidence that they knew it was illegal. ... The mere fact that you\u2019re trying to hide the transactions suggests that you knew it was illegal.\u201d In other words, this speaks to willfulness.\n\nThat Pecker decided not to accept the reimbursement from Trump because it would put AMI at risk: \u201cMy first reaction ... was, well, that\u2019s proof that they knew it was a violation of the law,\u201d Noble said. \u201cThat they knew they were paying to keep her quiet.\u201d When the recording was first released, Noble told The Post that coordination between the campaign and AMI would undermine a defense of the expenditure as being business-related. The Journal report makes clear that it wasn\u2019t.\n\n\"What this article does is fill in a lot of the lines alleging that Trump actually was specifically involved with these deals,\u201d Noble said. \u201cAnd if that is true, and if Pecker says that, then I think it is very hard for him to get out of an argument that it is campaign-related.\u201d And, therefore, illegal.\n\nThe Journal included the thoughts of Rick Hasen, an election-law expert at the University of California at Irvine. According to the Journal, Hasen argued that Trump\u2019s involvement in the payments wouldn\u2019t necessarily implicate him.\n\nIn a private message with The Post over Twitter, Hasen reinforced the importance of proving that the payments were related to the campaign, a point he made to us back in March. But since then, an additional point suggested that the payments were related: the Cohen guilty plea. That, Hasen said, was \u201csome evidence\u201d that the payments were campaign-related.\n\nThe Journal report bolsters much of the rest of Noble\u2019s five-part standard for demonstrating a violation.", "Civil rights leaders lashed out Friday at Jeff Sessions, who in one of his last acts as attorney general approved an order restricting the federal government\u2019s ability to enforce changes at state and local law enforcement agencies accused of abuse.\n\nIn a memo released late Thursday by the Justice Department and praised by police organizations, Sessions expanded the requirements for court-enforced \u201cconsent decrees\u201d reached with state and local government entities. Sessions signed the memo Wednesday, the day he resigned.\n\nIt says that two senior political appointees at the Justice Department must approve nearly all future agreements. The decrees also are to have a \u201csunset\u201d provision, limiting them to no more than three years. And Justice attorneys now must meet additional requirements beyond establishing that a police department repeatedly violated the Constitution.\n\nCivil rights advocates say Sessions\u2019s move rolls back progress made under the Obama administration. During those years, the Justice Department opened 25 investigations into law enforcement agencies in cities including Chicago, New Orleans, Cleveland and Ferguson, Mo., and was enforcing 14 consent decrees and other agreements. After the 2015 death of Freddie Gray, who suffered a spinal cord injury while in the custody of Baltimore police, the Justice Department reached an agreement that called for officers to be trained in resolving conflicts without force.\n\n\u201cThis memo seals Sessions\u2019s legacy as an obstructionist when it comes to advancing justice, promoting reform and protecting the rights of victims of discrimination,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\n\n[Sessions\u2019s law enforcement legacy overshadowed by Trump\u2019s fury]\n\nVanita Gupta, president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, called the action \u201ca slap in the face to the dedicated career staff of the department who work tirelessly to enforce our nation\u2019s civil rights laws and to the communities that depend on that enforcement.\u201d\n\n\u201cJeff Sessions\u2019s parting act was another attack on the core mission of the Department of Justice,\u201d said Gupta, who was head of the department\u2019s Civil Rights Division in the Obama administration. \u201cThe memo is designed to restrict consent decrees and creates a series of increasingly higher roadblocks to render them rare and ineffective.\u201d\n\nOne of Sessions\u2019s first actions, taken in March 2017, shortly after he took office, was to order the Justice Department to conduct a sweeping review of all reform agreements with troubled police departments. He said the review was necessary to ensure that the decrees did not work against the Trump administration\u2019s goal of promoting officer safety and morale while fighting violent crime.\n\n[Sessions orders Justice Department to review all police reform agreements]\n\nThat move and others were hailed by police departments and state and local officers across the country. Chuck Canterbury, the national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, also applauded the Sessions memo, saying that consent decrees henceforth will give more responsibility to local departments, include the views of rank-and-file officers and be \u201cmore collaborative.\u201d\n\nSteven H. Cook, a Justice Department official at the Office of Law Enforcement Affairs, said that Sessions made clear his view on consent decrees from the time he testified before Congress at his confirmation hearing in January 2017.\n\n\u201cHe said we\u2019re going to continue to police the police,\u201d Cook said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not going to condemn the entire department when there\u2019s a single or couple of wrongdoers. That was huge to police departments that were under consent decrees and police departments that weren\u2019t because they were constantly living in fear they would be next.\u201d\n\nThe new consent decree requirements pertain to all civil litigation against state or local government entities, not just police agreements.\n\nOn the day before President Trump asked Sessions to resign, Sessions again signaled his strong support of state and local police with his last line in a speech to a group of law enforcement officers.\n\n\u201cYou can be certain about this: We have your backs \u2014 and you have our thanks.\u201d", "Michelle Obama and her daughters greet Barack Obama at a campaign stop in Colorado in 2008.

Its title, \u201cBecoming,\u201d reflects her journey from modest beginnings on the South Side of Chicago to an incessant spotlight on the world stage.\n\nThough her life has been full and large, Obama is still figuring out who she wants to be. For the first time in two decades, she is allowing herself to explore her own ambitions separate from the rest of her family. She writes that her little girls, Malia and Sasha, are now \u201cyoung women with plans and voices of their own.\u201d Her husband is \u201ccatching his own breath\u201d after eight years as president. \u201cAnd here I am,\u201d she writes, \u201cin this new place, with a lot I want to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecoming\u201d is a political spouse\u2019s memoir like no other, and I say that as the author of one. Obama doesn\u2019t waste time naming every person who helped to elect her husband. This is her book, not his. She also cites, by name and deed, some of those who offended her. This is not an act of revenge but rather a clear sign that she is unwilling to pretend none of that mattered. Good for her.\n\nLife in the public glare has left Obama\u2019s distaste for politics as strong as ever. \u201cI\u2019ll say it here directly: I have no intention of running for office, ever,\u201d she writes. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a fan of politics, and my experience over the last ten years has done little to change that.\u201d\n\nDuring those 10 years, though, she learned a lot about herself and her marriage, and about America. She admits to insecurities and missteps. She acknowledges her many firsts as a black woman, and this fuels a sense of urgency in her writing. She wants to ensure that other black women get the chances she\u2019s had.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t been easy. \u201cSince stepping reluctantly into public life, I\u2019ve been held up as the most powerful woman in the world and taken down as an \u2018angry black woman,\u2019 \u201d she writes in the preface. Those three words \u2014 angry black woman \u2014 make her want to ask her detractors \u201cwhich part of that phrase matters to them the most \u2014 is it \u2018angry\u2019 or \u2018black\u2019 or \u2018woman\u2019?\u201d\n\nThe insincerity and indecency of politics at times left her hurt and furious. \u201cI\u2019ve smiled for photos with people who call my husband horrible names on national television, but still want a framed keepsake for their mantel,\u201d she writes. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about the swampy parts of the internet that question everything about me, right down to whether I\u2019m a woman or a man. A sitting U.S. congressman has made fun of my butt. . . . Mostly, I\u2019ve tried to laugh this stuff off.\u201d\n\nAt its heart, this memoir is a story about a smart and talented woman who grew up never doubting how much she was loved and will never forget her working-class roots. She is, first and foremost, the daughter of Fraser and Marian Robinson, who taught her and her older brother, Craig, that education and self-discipline were the path to a meaningful life. She devotes roughly the first third of her book to her childhood in their cramped apartment in 1960s South Side Chicago.\n\nHer parents\u2019 ambitions for their children set Michelle and Craig apart early from some of the other black children in their lives, including relatives. When she was about 10, Michelle was playing with a few cousins when one of them gave her a \u201csideways look and said, just a touch hotly, \u2018How come you talk like a white girl?\u2019 \u201d\n\nObama was mortified. \u201cBut I knew what she was getting at. There was no denying it,\u201d she writes. \u201cI did speak differently than some of my relatives, and so did Craig. Our parents had drilled into us the importance of using proper diction, of saying \u2018going\u2019 instead of \u2018goin\u2019 \u2019 and \u2018isn\u2019t\u2019 instead of \u2018ain\u2019t.\u2019 . . . The idea was we were to transcend, to get ourselves further.\u201d\n\nIn high school, a counselor discouraged her from applying to Princeton, where Craig was already a student. She ignored the advice and was accepted. Only 9 percent of her freshman class was black. This was a first for her. She writes movingly about \u201cthat everyday drain of being in a deep minority\u201d and the pressure she felt to prove to herself, and to others, that she \u201cbelonged at Princeton, as much as anybody.\u201d\n\nThere are many tender moments in this memoir, many centered on her father, whose health steadily declined from multiple sclerosis until his death at 55 in 1991. She describes how it hurt him to struggle against his encroaching disability, and she takes pains to show us the man separate from his disease. He fussed over his car and \u201cloved any excuse to drive,\u201d she writes. As a child, in the days before seatbelts, she would move forward in the back seat and rest her face next to her father\u2019s in front so \u201cwe\u2019d have the exact same view.\u201d\n\nShe was with her father just hours before he died and struggled for months with her grief. By then, Barack was in her life. \u201cOn many evenings,\u201d she writes, \u201cwhen I still got weepy over the loss of my dad, Barack was now there to curl himself around me and kiss the top of my head.\u201d\n\nNothing, she admits, could have prepared her for the likes of Barack Obama, who initially struck her as \u201coddly free from doubt, though at first glance it was hard to understand why.\u201d She started out as his law firm adviser during his student internship, and soon he became \u201ca wind that threatened to unsettle everything.\u201d\n\nShe is candid about their ongoing differences: She is a perfectionist and a planner who leaves little to chance. He is an optimist who \u201csees his opportunities as endless, who doesn\u2019t waste time or energy questioning whether they will ever dry up.\u201d It was his nature to \u201cget dinged up and stay shiny, like an old copper pot.\u201d\n\nShe loved his confidence, but early in their relationship, she worried about what his relentless striving might do to her dreams. \u201cI was deeply, delightfully in love with a guy whose forceful intellect and ambition could possibly end up swallowing mine,\u201d she writes. \u201cI did need to quickly anchor myself on two feet.\u201d\n\nHe was a good counterforce to her fear of uncertainty. Barack, she writes, taught her how to \u201cswerve,\u201d offering \u201cthe lone voice telling me to just go for it, to erase the worries and go toward whatever I thought would make me happy.\u201d\n\nAs both have acknowledged, their marriage has seen its challenges, starting when they had initial trouble starting a family. Her first pregnancy ended in a miscarriage, which she describes as \u201clonely, painful, and demoralizing almost on a cellular level.\u201d They went to a fertility doctor, who eventually recommended in vitro fertilization. Barack\u2019s session at the Illinois legislature started at the same time that she, for weeks, gave herself daily injections.\n\n\u201cIt was maybe then that I felt a first flicker of resentment involving politics and Barack\u2019s unshakable commitment to the work,\u201d she writes. \u201cOr maybe I was just feeling the acute burden of being female. Either way, he was gone and I was here, carrying the responsibility. . . . He was doting and invested, my husband, doing what he could do. He read all the IVF literature and would talk to me all night about it, but his only actual duty was to show up at the doctor\u2019s office and provide some sperm.\u201d\n\nWhile Michelle knew that none of it was Barack\u2019s fault, she still bristled at the built-in inequality. \u201cFor any woman who lives by the mantra that equality is important, this can be a little confusing,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt was me who\u2019d alter everything, putting my passions and career dreams on hold, to fulfill this piece of our dream. I found myself in a small moment of reckoning. Did I want it? Yes, I wanted it so much. And with this, I hoisted the needle and sank it into my flesh.\u201d\n\nBarack Obama has been publicly candid about their marital tension when their daughters were young and he was a busy state senator so frequently on the road. Michelle describes her life at that time as a \u201cworking full-time mother with a half-time spouse.\u201d Her husband\u2019s \u201coverloaded schedule was starting to really grate\u201d on her, and his disregard for punctuality was \u201ca straight-up aggravation.\u201d His ambition, she feared, \u201cwould end up steam-rolling our every need.\u201d\n\nCouples counseling helped. Michelle found ways to be happy without Barack leaving politics, and she was mindful of setting examples for her daughters. \u201cI didn\u2019t want them ever to believe that life began when the man of the house arrived home. We didn\u2019t wait for Dad. It was his job now to catch up with us.\u201d\n\nAlways the reluctant political spouse, she made clear that if he didn\u2019t win his U.S. Senate seat in 2004, he was done with politics. When he decided to run for president, she admits: \u201cHe wanted it and I didn\u2019t.\u201d Ultimately, she agreed because \u201cI believed that Barack could be a great president.\u201d\n\nAfter Barack prevailed in 2008, Michelle eventually found her way as first lady, and she writes at length about her advocacy for military families and girls, and her campaign against childhood obesity. At times, her recounting of all this reads like an annotated curriculum vitae, but she is proud of her accomplishments and perhaps concerned that her legacy is lost in this current political climate.\n\nOn the night Donald Trump was elected in 2016, Michelle excused herself from the room where she and Barack and some friends were watching the returns. \u201cI announced that I was going upstairs,\u201d she writes. \u201cI walked to the elevator, hoping to do only one thing, which was to block it all out and go to sleep. I understood what was happening, but I wasn\u2019t ready to face it.\u201d\n\nShe is unsparing in her criticism of her husband\u2019s successor, and she takes aim at Trump\u2019s racist rhetoric and his years of falsely insisting that Barack was not born in the United States. \u201cThe whole thing was crazy and mean-spirited,\u201d she writes, \u201cits underlying bigotry and xenophobia hardly concealed. But it was also dangerous, deliberately meant to stir up the wingnuts and kooks. I feared the reaction.\u201d She blames Trump for his \u201cloud and reckless innuendos\u201d that put her \u201cfamily\u2019s safety at risk. And for this, I\u2019d never forgive him.\u201d\n\nThroughout \u201cBecoming,\u201d Obama strikes an impressive balance in telling the truth of her challenges while repeatedly acknowledging her lucky life. \u201cI grew up with a disabled dad in a too-small house with not much money in a starting-to-fail neighborhood,\u201d she writes, \u201cand I also grew up surrounded by love and music in a diverse city in a country where an education can take you far. I had nothing or I had everything. It depends on which way you want to tell it.\u201d", "\n\nPresident Trump looks on as Jerome H. Powell, his then-nominee to become chairman of the Federal Reserve, speaks at the White House in November 2017. (Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nReporter\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s continuing attempts to stop the Justice Department from doing what he doesn\u2019t want it to has an economic lesson for us, as well: The Federal Reserve is next.\n\nThe simple story here is the Fed is raising rates more than Trump would like, and it seems like a matter of time until his escalating war of words against it turns into action. Trump, after all, has already gone from saying he\u2019s \u201cnot thrilled\u201d with what the Fed is doing to being \u201cvery unhappy\u201d about it to considering it to be the \u201cbiggest risk\u201d to the economy. So you don\u2019t have to read between the lines when Trump says, as far as he\u2019s concerned, the Fed is independent only \u201cin theory.\"\n\nThis, of course, is only going to get worse the closer we get to the 2020 election. There are two reasons for this. The first is the Fed has given every indication that it\u2019s going to keep increasing interest rates at the same slow and steady pace it has set for the past two years. While it didn\u2019t raise them at its meeting Thursday, it made a point of reiterating more rate hikes are coming soon. Why wouldn\u2019t they? Trump pushed a $1.5 trillion deficit-financed tax cut for corporations into the economy at a time when unemployment was already 4.1 percent. That has forced the Fed to raise interest rates more than it was going to, so it might not be long before rates are up to about 3 percent or even higher.\n\nThat might not sound like much, and it\u2019s not by historical standards, but it is by our current-day ones. Interest rates are still zero in both the euro zone and Japan. That means investors can do a lot better putting their money in U.S. Treasury bonds than in, say, German ones \u2014 and when they do, the dollar goes up. Quite a bit, in fact. Consider this: Since the start of the year, the dollar, on a trade-weighted basis, is up 7.6 percent against a broad basket of currencies and is near a 20-year high.\n\nThat\u2019s the second reason Trump\u2019s fight with the Fed is going to get a lot uglier. A stronger dollar hurts two of the things he talks about most on the economy: the trade deficit and factory jobs.\n\nIt\u2019s fairly straightforward: The higher the dollar gets against other currencies, the more our exports cost in other countries. So they will buy less of what we make \u2014 particularly manufactured goods \u2014 and we\u2019ll buy more of their cheaper goods. This isn\u2019t necessarily an economic problem, but it can be a political one. At least it was for Democrats in 2016. That was the last time the dollar got this high, and the result was a localized blue-collar recession that might have helped tilt pivotal Rust Belt states to Trump.\n\nTrump is going to keep feeling threatened by the Fed. As we\u2019ve seen, he doesn\u2019t let things like norms get in the way when he feels threatened \u2014 especially before an election. He\u2019ll fire or push out whomever he has to, even if they\u2019re supposed to be independent. That was the case with the FBI director and the attorney general, and it could become the case with Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell. That said, there is a difference here: Justice Department officials are only unofficially independent, while the Fed chair is as a matter of law. The head of the Fed can be fired only \u201cfor cause,\u201d which generally isn\u2019t considered to include policy disagreements. That\u2019s the kind of thing that would need to be enforced by the courts.\n\nWould they? Good question.\n\nIn the meantime, you might want to pay extra attention to anyone on television who says the Fed is raising rates too fast. There\u2019s a good chance Trump will be.", "French President Emmanuel Macron will be trying out for the role of leader of Europe this weekend.\n\nAs he hosts more than 60 heads of state for a ceremony and peace summit tied to the centennial of World War I\u2019s bloody end, Macron will have an opportunity to show he can bring great powers together and give voice to the values that bind them.\n\nFrance\u2019s young president, just 40 years old, has long advocated a stronger, reinvigorated European Union and regularly condemns the nationalism spreading across the continent. He stands ready to continue the fight now that German Chancellor Angela Merkel has signaled she will exit the stage.\n\nBut Europe may be too divided to accept a grand vision pronounced by a single leader, and Merkel\u2019s departure may do more to isolate Macron than to boost his standing.\n\n\u201cEuropeans are too deeply divided among themselves \u2014 and on the fundamentals,\u201d said Dominique Mo\u00efsi, a foreign policy analyst at the Institut Montaigne in Paris and former Macron campaign adviser.\n\n\u201cWhat you have is a Europe that is segmenting into different tribes,\u201d said Mark Leonard, director of the London-based European Council on Foreign Relations. These segments are multiplying along an increasing number of fractures, he said.\n\n\u201cThere is a clear north-south division over the euro crisis and an east-west division over migration and Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cYou also have highly polarized societies in most member states, and that does mean that having a single leader of Europe is kind of utopian at the moment.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the biggest question for Macron\u2019s position in Europe is what will happen after Merkel leaves office.\n\nThe German chancellor has announced that she will not seek reelection as chairman of her political party next month or as Germany\u2019s leader when her term ends in 2021.\n\nMerkel has been a constant of European politics since she assumed the chancellery in 2005, outlasting many of her opponents abroad and challenges to her leadership from within.\n\nWithout her, Macron will have less competition as the dominant player in Europe, but he will also lose a key political ally.\n\n\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron have worked together to encourage a united Europe. (Michael Kappeler/Picture Alliance/ Getty Images)\n\nThe Franco-German alliance has been called the \u201cmotor\u201d of the E.U., the central connection without which the entire European machine would cease to function. Many of the E.U.\u2019s recent successes have depended on productive partnerships across the Rhine: Helmut Kohl and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand in the 1980s and 1990s; and Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy, dubbed \u201cMerkozy,\u201d in the early 2010s.\n\nMacron and Merkel, too, have had a fine partnership. Internal pressure from the more conservative factions of her shaky coalition government forced Merkel to resist some of Macron\u2019s European proposals \u2014 notably his plans for further economic integration. But she has been a tireless defender of the E.U. since before Macron emerged onto the scene. Her absence will likely leave Macron on his own in the defense of an \u201cever greater\u201d union.\n\n\u201cThe center doesn\u2019t really hold in the same way that it did,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cIt looks more like a Franco-German bunker than a motor.\u201d\n\nThere may soon be only one man left in that bunker. Even if Merkel is succeeded by someone with a similar ideology, that person undoubtedly would bring less clout.\n\n\u201cFrance is a very important [E.U.] member state, but not strong enough on its own to bring other countries along with it,\u201d Leonard added.\n\nOn the world stage, Macron has already had many disappointments. Despite his efforts to woo President Trump, he watched helplessly as the United States withdrew from the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal. Trump will further slight the French president by attending the ceremony but skipping the peace summit this weekend.\n\nWithin France, Macron has successfully pushed through a host of revisions designed to liberalize a famously regulated labor market and to stimulate economic growth. But he has paid a heavy price in popularity. According to a September poll from Ifop, a leading French polling agency, his approval rating is at 29 percent, less than half of what it was when he was elected in May 2017.\n\nBy contrast, Europe\u2019s leading nationalist voices, whom Macron has publicly challenged on any number of occasions, remain quite popular. Matteo Salvini, Italy\u2019s interior minister and de facto leader, enjoys an approval rating of 59 percent, according to a poll released this week by the Italian newspaper La Repubblica \u2014 making Salvini roughly twice as popular among Italians as Macron is with the French.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s weakened by the fact that he\u2019s orphaned by Merkel,\u201d said Mo\u00efsi, \u201cand he\u2019s weakened inside by the spectacular fall of his popularity.\u201d\n\nA separate Ifop poll, published Sunday, shows that Macron\u2019s party, La R\u00e9publique En Marche, or Republic on the Move, has less support than France\u2019s far-right Rassemblement National, or National Rally, in advance of the 2019 European parliamentary elections.\n\n\u201cIn a way, the summit that opens this weekend comes a bit too late for him,\u201d Mo\u00efsi said.\n\nMacron, nonetheless, has focused his pitch this week on his concern about the resurgence of populist tribalism in Europe and the importance of political integration, which he credits with guaranteeing European prosperity and peace.\n\nIn interviews, he has invoked the darkest chapters of Europe\u2019s recent history to underscore his anxieties about its present.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m struck to see two things that resemble terribly the 1930s,\u201d Macron told France\u2019s Europe 1 radio. \u201cThe fact that our Europe was rocked by a profound economic and financial crisis . . . and the rise of nationalisms that play on fears.\u201d\n\nThe point, he said, is to recognize the fragility of the European enterprise launched after the two world wars.\n\n\u201cWe need a strong Europe, one that protects,\u201d he said.\n\nThe question is how many of his guests agree.\n\nRead more\n\nAs the world marks 100 years since the end of WWI, nationalism is on the rise again\n\nAs Trump prepares to visit Paris, Europeans wonder whether \u2018America first\u2019 is built to last\n\nTrump\u2019s nationalism looms over Europe\u2019s WWI commemoration\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "\n\nNational Trade Council adviser Peter Navarro waits for President Trump for an event in the Oval Office at the White House in 2017.

Last month, the Interior Department\u2019s acting inspector general, Mary Kendall, referred that inquiry, which is examining whether Zinke used his office for personal gain, to the Justice Department.\n\n\u201cThis is our check and balance, our constitutional obligation and our jurisdiction,\u201d Grijalva said. \u201cUs exercising our oversight and accountability responsibilities is not asking for a war with the administration.\u201d\n\nNew emails released this week to the environmental advocacy group the Sierra Club under the Freedom of Information Act show that the secretary met a wealthy developer from Sacramento to discuss wildlife issues after a college friend and political supporter described Angelo Tsakopoulos as \u201ca very powerful billionaire California Liberal Democrat.\u201d\n\nEd Hagerty \u2014 who played football in college with Zinke at the University of Oregon and has worked in energy investing \u2014 donated $10,000 in 2012 to a super PAC Zinke established, according to federal records.\n\n\u201cI do know he also has powerful feelings that concern the Army Corps of Engineers and their work within the state of California,\u201d Hagerty wrote in a June 23, 2017, email.\n\nHagerty asked Zinke, whom he referred to as \u201cZ-Man,\u201d \u201cWould it be possible to arrange a meeting for Angelo with someone high up on your staff?\u201d\n\nZinke replied an hour and a half later: \u201cEd, I would be glad to take the meeting personally.\u201d\n\nTsakopoulos is a land developer who unsuccessfully challenged federal restrictions on plowing up wetlands under the Clean Water Act. In 2002, the Supreme Court upheld a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit that Tsakopoulos violated the law when he used a bulldozer with a deep plow to rip up wetlands he owned in an effort to convert them into agricultural land.\n\nAccording to Zinke\u2019s official calendar, three months later the meeting took place in the secretary\u2019s conference room, billed \u201cto discuss how farmers, developers, business interest can work with federal agencies to conserve wildlife more efficiently.\u201d\n\nMarika Rose, a consultant for Tsakopoulos, said the developer had a conflict and sent a representative instead.\n\n[White House concerned Zinke may have violated federal rules]\n\nAsked about the meeting, Interior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift said in an emailed statement, \u201cWorking with the private sector to conserve wildlife and habitat has been a recurring theme in the Secretary\u2019s tenure so it\u2019s unsurprising that he had a meeting on that issue in 2017.\u201d\n\nBut Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said the exchange showed how personal connections are driving decisions at the Interior Department. Earlier this year, the agency proposed changing Endangered Species Act regulations in a way that would make it more difficult to declare protected habitat.\n\n\u201cRyan Zinke has proven over and over again that he is incapable of understanding he works for the people, not his football buddies and their billionaire contacts,\u201d Brune said in an email. \u201cDonald Trump needs to fire Zinke rather than allow him to abuse his power to enrich himself and his friends for another day longer.\u201d\n\nThe June 2017 email exchange is not the only time Zinke or his aides had emailed about whether to meet with billionaires. In April 2017 the secretary agreed to meet entrepreneur Palmer Luckey, whom conservative activist Charles Johnson described as someone \u201cwho sold his company to Oculus Rift for $2.5B.\u201d\n\nIn forwarding the request, Scott McEwen \u2014 co-author of Zinke\u2019s memoir, \u201cAmerican Commander\u201d \u2014 wrote: \u201cAnother Billionaire wants a meeting \u2014 up to you guys. I don\u2019t know this guy, can\u2019t confirm the alleged meeting with the pres., but confirmed he did make some serious cash lately.\u201d\n\nPublic records also show that Zinke took 66 \u201cpersonal days\u201d between March 2017 and August 2018, excluding weekends and federal holidays. That total exceeds the 39 annual days off federal senior executives would be given during that same period.\n\nSwift, who noted that Cabinet members are excluded from the standard federal leave system since they often work outside normal work hours and while traveling, said Zinke \u201cgenerally chooses to work through the weekend and then take his personal time to spend with his wife and children who do not live in D.C.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring these days outside of the office, the Secretary continues to work on Departmental matters,\u201d she said, emphasizing that he has worked \u201cat least 35 weekends\u201d outside Washington and on some days that were marked \u201cpersonal on his calendar.\u201d\n\nZinke\u2019s schedule shows that he worked for nine weekend days, most of them early in his tenure when he was touring national monuments. On 18 weekend days, his schedule included flights as part of his official duties. All those trips were return flights to Washington from his homes in California and Montana, or from national monuments.\n\nCenter for Western Priorities spokesman Aaron Weiss questioned why the secretary would take so much time off when Cabinet members usually serve for only a few years.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a lot of time to get stuff done,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWhat kind of message does that send if you\u2019re not even in the office approximately one week out of four?\u201d\n\nZinke\u2019s aides have rejected the notion that he is resigned to leaving the administration. After Politico reported Thursday night that Zinke had begun discussing the prospect of taking a job with Fox News executives and had told associates he would resign by the end of the year, the network and Swift dismissed the claims.\n\nZinke has not spoken about the inquiries he faces this week, though he tweeted on Wednesday: \u201cCongratulations to all the new members of the House and Senate. I look forward to working with all of you to advance important @Interior priorities like rebuilding @NatlParkService infrastructure, ending #OpioidCrisis in Indian Country, and achieving #EnergyDominance.\u201d\n\nAlice Crites, Sarah Ellison and Darryl Fears contributed to this report.", "* Freeze warning Saturday night for the cities and Interstate 95 area south and east *\n\nIt was a raw day across the region as highs reached the upper 40s and lower 50s. Rain that increased in coverage this afternoon is at its peak late this afternoon into early evening. It\u2019ll be heading away in the near future.

The intensity of the rain should gradually ease and eventually finish by mid- to late evening. An end-time window of about 4 to 6 p.m. for areas south and west of Washington should work, between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. in the city, and a bit later to the north and east. A couple more spotty showers can\u2019t be ruled out overnight until the front passes but skies should begin to clear out by the predawn hours. Most spots seem likely to finish with about half an inch to one inch of rain.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Saturday): The biting cold is a rude awakening. Considering how deep into October the warmth remained, this first blast of cold will come as a bit of shock. Daytime temperatures hover near 40 in our colder areas to the mid-40s elsewhere.

Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Tex.), making his concession speech on Tuesday in El Paso. O\u2019Rourke lost in his bid to unseat incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. (Eric Gay/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nThe 2018 midterms \u2014 like every election \u2014 have provided an opportunity for yet another iteration of the eternal argument among Democrats about whether they need to tack to the center or move to the left if they want to win future elections.\n\nThe problem, though, is that neither of those options captures what just happened, or the real challenge the party is confronting. It can do both, and something more.\n\nRight now, centrist Democrats are crowing that a number of Bernie Sanders-style socialist Democrats either failed to win primaries or lost in the general election, while many other Democrats who ran less ideological campaigns ended up winning. But there are also reasons to believe that centrism wasn\u2019t what worked either. Alex Seitz-Wald of NBC News sums up the picture:\n\nDespite a good night for congressional Democrats overall, nearly all of national progressive groups\u2019 star candidates fell short in their contests in red or purple districts and states, potentially slowing the momentum the emboldened left had enjoyed since Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss two years ago. . . . Moderates can hardly claim to have found a sure-fire recipe for success either after Tuesday night, however. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, D-Texas, who supported impeaching President Donald Trump, came within three percentage points of winning a Senate seat in Texas, which hasn\u2019t sent a Democrat to the upper chamber in 30 years. Meanwhile, incumbent Democratic Sens. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who both tacked aggressively to the center, lost by wider margins in friendlier states. And Tennessee Democratic Senate challenger Phil Bredesen, who said he would have voted to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, got trounced by 11 percentage points to an unpopular opponent. Overall, the results offer mixed signals for Democrats, providing just enough evidence for both sides to continue their low-boil civil war.\n\nSo the real answer to \u201cShould Democrats run to the center or to the left?\u201d is: It depends. Every district and every state is different, and what\u2019s really important to understand is that it isn\u2019t just about finding where each district or state lies on a line from most liberal to most conservative.\n\nThe most important question to ask may be this: Just how many liberal voters are out there to mobilize?\n\nIf the answer turns out to be that there are quite a few, running as a progressive even in a place with lots of conservatives may be the best strategy. The question isn\u2019t whether there are lots of people in your district who love guns or worship Trump or hate liberals, it\u2019s whether there are enough Democrats about to counter them, no matter how conservative the Republicans might be.\n\nTake Wisconsin, for instance. Proponents of moderate politics might say the classic swing state is precisely the kind of place where Democrats should want to reach across the aisle to win persuadable voters. But evidence suggests that there actually aren\u2019t that many of them there. As Alec MacGillis noted in 2015, \u201cWisconsin is not politically purple because it is full of voters who straddle party lines and swing back and forth from election to election. It is purple because it is divided into two strikingly cohesive and fiercely energized camps.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why the state can elect a right-wing culture warrior and advocate for the plutocracy like Scott Walker as governor, but also elect Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a strong progressive who was the first openly gay senator in U.S. history. On Tuesday, Baldwin won reelection by a comfortable 11-point margin.\n\nWhat O\u2019Rourke showed is that Texas isn\u2019t all that dissimilar, it\u2019s just that the balance is shifted a little too far to the right. Texas Democrats could have told you that there are lots of liberals in the state, and they were energized by O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign. He fell short by less than three points, compared to the 16 points Ted Cruz won by in 2012. It would be difficult to argue that a centrist Democrat would have beaten Cruz, just as there\u2019s no reason to believe a full-throated socialist would have been able to hold Sen. Joe Manchin III\u2019s seat in West Virginia, a state that gave Trump a larger margin of victory than any other except Wyoming.\n\nAt the same time, this election reminded us that, as we\u2019ve known for a long time, progressive policies, as opposed to progressive candidates, are popular just about everywhere. Voters passed initiatives expanding Medicaid in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah. Voting rights and anti-gerrymandering measures passed in Florida, Michigan, Utah, Colorado, and Maryland. Marijuana legalization passed in Michigan, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Utah. Voters in Arkansas and Missouri increased the minimum wage. All of those are progressive policies that are embraced by both the center and left of the Democratic Party.\n\nI suspect that when we have these arguments, liberals all have in the back (or maybe the front) of their minds the kind of presidential candidate and campaign they\u2019d like to see. That is its own very particular question, one that can be more complicated than what kind of candidate is best suited for a particular district. Recent elections should have shown us that if you\u2019re going to have a national mobilization strategy, you need a candidate who gets voters up out of their chairs. The Democrat who has the charisma to do that \u2014 whatever their precise ideological position \u2014 is the one that\u2019s going to beat Donald Trump.\n\nRead more:\n\nPaul Waldman: GOP voter suppression continues, yet Democrats won big anyway\n\nGreg Sargent: Trump\u2019s authoritarian response to Florida shenanigans hints at worse to come\n\nGreg Sargent: Can the Democratic majority that won the House endure through 2020?\n\nDana Milbank: Can the Democrats keep it together?\n\nJennifer Rubin: Three days later: Hey, Republicans really did get clobbered", "\n\nMartha Aguirre, a 20-year-old psychology student, this week at her apartment in Mexico's Veracruz state. (Raul Vera/Raul Vera)\n\nISLA, Mexico \u2014 The day the caravan swept into her hometown, Martha Virginia Aguirre grabbed an armful of leftover tamales from the Day of the Dead holiday and gave them all to the Central Americans camping out on her street.\n\nShe was thinking of her parents in Maryland, her aunts and cousins in California.\n\nFor years, Aguirre was a \u201cdreamer,\u201d an immigrant in the United States brought in illegally as a child. Her family moved to Maryland, but college back then was prohibitively expensive for students in the United States illegally. In 2011, her parents sent Aguirre and her older brother home to Mexico to finish high school and earn their degrees.\n\nLess than a year later, President Barack Obama created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which would have let them stay in the United States. Since taking office in 2017, President Trump has tried unsuccessfully to end DACA.\n\nA federal appeals court ruled Thursday that Trump cannot immediately end the program that shields from deportation young immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children.\n\nAguirre, now 20, has relearned Spanish, finished high school and enrolled in a private college in the city in the state of Veracruz. But she hasn\u2019t hugged her parents for seven years \u2014 if they leave the United States without papers, they might not be able to get back in.\n\nIn Maryland, they work long hours at a seafood restaurant and send money home to cover Aguirre\u2019s studies and rent. Her brother, Salvador, 23, finished high school and did not go to college; he is a bartender in Cabo San Lucas.\n\nWhen she misses her parents, her father gives her pep talks over the phone.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d he tells her. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be worth it.\u201d\n\nBut in a small cottage outside Baltimore on Thursday, tears welled in her father\u2019s eyes. He has not seen his mother since 1999. His father died in 2007.\n\nHe and his wife \u2014 who asked not to be identified, for fear of deportation \u2014 worked two jobs for years in the United States. She is 41 and has arthritis. He is 47, and his arms are scarred with long burns from cooking oil.\n\nThough migration by Mexicans is declining, they remain the largest group of immigrants in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington research organization. Most have lived in the United States for nearly two decades, and many are here illegally.\n\nEven before Trump was elected, more than 1 million returned home, and Aguirre says there is some relief in being away from an increasingly hostile environment. Trump characterized Mexicans as criminals during his campaign and vowed to build a wall at the Mexico\u2019s expense.\n\n\u201cI know that I\u2019m in my country. I know that I\u2019m home,\u201d she said in English. \u201cI know that if I go outside, I don\u2019t have to worry about someone coming and taking me away from my family.\u201d\n\nTrump has fired similar criticisms at the Central American migrants traveling through Mexico toward the United States. But Mexicans along the route would not have it. They showered them with gifts, clothes and food.\n\nOn Nov. 3 in Isla, as hundreds of migrants crammed into a community center and spilled onto the street, Aguirre\u2019s grandmother Martha Ascanio Dominguez ordered Aguirre and her aunts to make them coffee and serve sweet bread and tamales left over from the Day of the Dead.\n\nShe let a long line of women use her shower and waved a hand at them when they offered to pay. She washed their clothes and dried them. They slept on her porch.\n\n\u201cI did it with all my heart,\u201d Ascanio Dominguez said, noting that she hasn\u2019t seen three of her eight children since they moved to the United States to work starting in the 1990s. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve felt sick, I have had such a longing for my children.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Aguirre returned to her college town.\n\nOn her wall she has photos of a family trip to Lake Tahoe, from when they lived in California. She and her mother used to watch \u201cThe Polar Express\u201d together every Christmas. Now they watch it over the phone, from their houses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard, because sometimes you want to come home and you want to find your mom or your dad,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d she said, starting to cry, \u201cyou never stop needing them, actually.\u201d\n\nIn Maryland, her father said he wishes he could freely travel between both countries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always worked in this country,\u201d he said with a deep sigh, noting that his original recipes have made it onto the restaurant menu where he works. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful to the United States.\u201d\n\nBut he said he intends to be home for his daughter\u2019s college graduation with a psychology degree, probably in 2020.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s, like, his dream,\u201d his daughter said.", "In this sketch, Cesar Sayoc raises a hand in federal district court in Manhattan on Nov. 6, 2018, to swear to the truthfulness of his assertion that he needs state-assigned counsel. (Elizabeth Williams/AP)\n\nFederal prosecutors in New York on Friday secured a 30-count indictment against the man accused of mailing possible package bombs to prominent Democrats and Trump critics across the country, bringing charges that are more severe and more numerous than those he previously faced.\n\nCesar Sayoc, 56, who had been living in a van in Aventura, Fla., faces a possible sentence of life in prison on the basis of the charges, which include five counts of using a weapon of mass destruction, five counts of illegal mailing of explosives, and five counts of threatening interstate communications. His next court appearance was not immediately scheduled.\n\nAn attorney for Sayoc did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nAuthorities have said they think Sayoc is responsible for mailing 16 possible explosive devices to people considered foes of President Trump, including former president Barack Obama, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr., liberal billionaire George Soros and others. Sayoc was arrested last month and charged with five counts.

FBI Director Christopher A. Wray has said they were not hoaxes.\n\nFamily members and associates of Sayoc\u2019s have said he was a troubled man who struggled with mental-health problems and lied as he sought to find an identity with which he was comfortable. He worked in strip clubs, dabbled in bodybuilding and had frequent run-ins with the law, including a 2002 incident in which he threatened to blow up a Florida utility company.\n\nAs far back as 2015, he took an interest in Trump \u2014 attending campaign events and posting on social media his support for the then-presidential candidate. \u00adSayoc covered the van he lived in with pro-Trump stickers and decals of the president\u2019s opponents with crosshairs over their faces.\n\nProsecutors have alleged previously that Sayoc began planning to send the possible bombs \u2014 composed of six inches of PVC pipe, a small clock, a battery, wiring and what authorities termed \u201cenergetic,\u201d or possibly explosive, material \u2014 as far back as July. The Internet search history on his phone showed he searched \u201chilary Clinton hime [sic] address\u201d on July 15 and \u201caddress Debbie wauserman Shultz\u201d on July 26.\n\nEach of the packages listed Shultz \u2014 a likely misspelling of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) \u2014 in the return address. Sayoc searched throughout September and October for the addresses of others \u2014 including Obama, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and major Democratic donor Tom Steyer, prosecutors have said.\n\nThe FBI linked Sayoc to the devices via fingerprints and a possible DNA match, authorities have said. His attorney in Florida, where he first appeared in court, has called the evidence against Sayoc \u201cflimsy.\u201d", "The razor-close Senate race in Florida erupted into outright partisan warfare Friday as Democrats pressed for a recount and Republicans \u2014 including President Trump \u2014 accused local elections officials of tilting the outcome against them.\n\nTrump and his allies offered no evidence that fraud was to blame for a diminishing GOP lead in heavily Democratic Broward County in South Florida, where the still-unfinished counting of absentee and provisional ballots has narrowed Republican Rick Scott\u2019s statewide lead to less than one-half of a percentage point.\n\nThe margin is expected to trigger a recount of ballots, which could begin as early as Saturday in counties across the state. It also has prompted vocal protests from Republicans \u2014 a dramatic shift in rhetoric since Tuesday, when Trump declared \u201cincredible\u201d victories across the country and stayed away from accusations of a \u201crigged\u201d election despite mixed results.\n\nThose accusations came roaring back Friday in both Florida and Arizona, where another close Senate race hangs on a slow ballot count.\n\n\u201cRick Scott was up by 50,000+ votes on Election Day, now they \u2018found\u2019 many votes and he is only up 15,000 votes,\u201d Trump tweeted Friday about the Florida Senate race. \u201c \u2018The Broward Effect.\u2019 How come they never find Republican votes?\u201d\n\n[Democratic candidates in Florida pull into recount range]\n\n\n\nBrenda Snipes, Broward County supervisor of elections, right, speaks with officials before a canvassing board meeting Friday.

Bill Nelson \u2014 but more for Nelson. That didn\u2019t stop other Republicans, including Donald Trump Jr. and Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), from raising accusations of fraud.\n\nOn the ground in Broward County, protesters took to the sidewalks outside election offices in Lauderhill to demand the ouster of Brenda Snipes, the supervisor of elections, who has faced a string of accusations of mismanagement over the past decade. The scene was reminiscent of the partisan street fights that accompanied the contentious presidential recount of 2000; for three hours, about 200 people shouted and waved signs.\n\n\u201cMake every vote count!\u201d Democrats yelled.\n\n\u201cTwice!\u201d replied the Republicans, mockingly. The nearly constant chants mentioned Trump more than Scott, but mostly they centered on Snipes. \u201cLock her up!\u201d protesters repeated hundreds of times, echoing the cry at Trump campaign rallies about Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nProtest signs demanding the ouster of the supervisor of elections, Brenda Snipes, were posted outside election offices in Broward County, Fla., on Friday. (Lori Rozsa/For The Washington Post)\n\nScott, Florida\u2019s governor, in an appearance at the governor\u2019s mansion Thursday, went so far as to suggest \u201crampant fraud\u201d and called for a state law enforcement investigation, drawing criticism from Nelson that he is using the power of his office to ensure his Senate victory.\n\n\u201cThe governor has decided to abandon the most fundamental of all rights because he fears that he will lose the election if all the votes are counted,\u201d Nelson said in a video released Friday. \u201c . . . Votes are not being found. They\u2019re being counted.\u201d\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, Scott had a lead over Nelson of just more than 16,000 votes, or 0.19 percent, according to the Associated Press. In the governor\u2019s race, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum (D) trailed former congressman Ron DeSantis (R) by more than 36,000 votes, or 0.45 percent.\n\nUnder Florida law, a statewide machine recount is conducted when the margin of victory is less than 0.5 percent, and a manual recount is ordered if the margin is less than 0.25 percent.\n\nA lawyer for Nelson, Marc Elias, said in a call with reporters Friday that the canvass underway in Broward and elsewhere in Florida is a \u201cfeature, not a flaw, of our democratic system\u201d to ensure that all valid votes are counted. He accused Republicans of falsely claiming voter fraud simply because the margin had changed.\n\n\u201cThe lead is just over 15,000 votes now, which seemed to cause the governor to hold an impromptu news conference to acknowledge the shrinking state of the margin,\u201d Elias said.\n\nBoth campaigns also went to court, allowing Scott to claim two quick victories Friday, when a judge ordered officials in Palm Beach County to open their canvass to public inspection, and another judge ordered Broward officials to release documents the governor had demanded.\n\nNelson\u2019s suit seeks to reexamine absentee and provisional ballots when signatures on the ballots don\u2019t match voter registration records. In Georgia last month, a federal judge ordered local election officials to stop throwing out ballots because of signature issues.\n\nThe Scott campaign lashed back. \u201cTheir desperation has driven them to ask the federal courts to allow voter fraud,\u201d campaign manager Jackie Schutz Zeckman said. \u201cThey are asking courts to overrule election officials and accept ballots that were not legally cast.\u201d\n\nReports have poured in from voters complaining that their ballots were improperly rejected; one came from Patrick Murphy, a former Democratic congressman from Palm Beach, who tweeted: \u201cJust saw notice from @PBCounty that my absentee ballot wasn\u2019t counted due to \u2018invalid signature\u2019 match. Should be +1 @NelsonForSenate @AndrewGillum. Must overhaul these ridiculous barriers to voting.\u201d\n\nIn Georgia, the closely fought governor\u2019s contest has prompted Democrats to accuse Republican contender Brian Kemp of misconduct. Kemp served as secretary of state until Thursday and was a champion of new voting laws that Democrats say disenfranchised thousands of voters, most of them minorities. Supporters of Democrat Stacey Abrams scrambled Friday to force a runoff by helping voters validate their provisional ballots.\n\nThis is not the first time Broward County and Snipes, the elections supervisor there, have been at the center of ballot-counting controversies. Broward was the setting for contentious debates over \u201changing chads\u201d and other ballot irregularities that determined the outcome of the 2000 presidential contest between George W. Bush and Al Gore.\n\nDuring the 2004 presidential election, Snipes blamed the U.S. Postal Service for losing 58,000 absentee ballots, then later announced that only 6,000 ballots had disappeared. Postal officials said they had done nothing wrong. Then Snipes\u2019s office dropped off 2,400 blank absentee ballots for voters at the post office on a Saturday before the election, after mail carriers were already gone for the day.\n\nAnd in 2016, Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz faced a primary challenge from a Bernie Sanders-backed candidate, Tim Canova, in Florida\u2019s 23rd District.

Snipes was accused of destroying the physical ballots while saving digital copies as the lawsuit was pending \u2014 a violation of a federal statute requiring that congressional ballots be saved for 22 months after an election.\n\n\u201cEvery Floridian should be concerned there may be rampant fraud happening in Palm Beach and Broward counties, and the Broward supervisor of elections, Brenda Snipes, has a history of acting in absolute bad faith,\u201d Scott said Thursday.\n\nRubio said that Snipes is a \u201ccandidate for removal.\u201d\n\nSnipes could not be reached for comment. Her attorney, Burnadette Norris-Weeks, argued that vote-counting takes time in large counties such as Broward.

Scott also said it was \u201chard to believe they are still counting.\u201d\n\nState law allows the governor to suspend an elections supervisor for malfeasance or incompetence and appoint a replacement. Snipes was appointed by then-Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican, in 2003 after he ousted her predecessor.\n\nA spokesman for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Jeremy Burns, said the agency had not begun an investigation in response to Scott\u2019s demand because the Department of State said there are currently no allegations of fraud. The governor has the ability to single-handedly direct an investigation by submitting a letter to the agency\u2019s director, Burns said, but he has not done so.\n\nEach county\u2019s three-person canvassing board is required to report returns by noon Saturday. The Florida secretary of state will then determine if any races meet the threshold for machine recounts. If recounts are ordered, those tallies are due by Thursday. Then, the secretary of state will determine if any races meet the threshold for a manual recount, which is defined as \u201ca hand recount of overvotes and undervotes set aside from the machine recount.\u201d\n\nThose set-aside ballots \u2014 in which voters skipped a race or voted for two candidates in one race \u2014 would be the subject of the manual recount.\n\nRozsa reported from Lauderhill, Fla.

As the first seriously wintry air mass of the season arrives this weekend, widespread freezing temperatures are possible pretty much everywhere overnight Saturday.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a freeze warning for much of the Interstate 95 corridor and locations to the east Saturday night into Sunday morning.

The new Parliament is to be convened on Jan. 17.\n\nSri Lanka has been in a political crisis since Oct. 26, when Sirisena fired his prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and replaced him with former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa.\n\nWickremesinghe has insisted his firing is unconstitutional. He has refused to vacate his official residence and demanded that Parliament be summoned immediately to prove he had support among its members.\n\nSirisena had suspended Parliament for two weeks in a move Wickremesinghe\u2019s backers said was designed to buy time to shore up support.\n\nThere were calls both locally and internationally to convene Parliament to end the impasse.\n\nAmid the pressure, Sirisena announced Parliament would be summoned Nov.14.

(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nMedia critic\n\nApril Ryan has been covering the White House for 21 years, all the way back to the presidency of Bill Clinton. Her titles are White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks. She\u2019s also a political analyst for CNN, a job that she secured after pressing White House officials with tough questions about the issues of the day. In the early days of the Trump administration, she asked then-press secretary Sean Spicer about the impact of the Russia issue on President Trump.\n\nWhen Ryan appeared unimpressed with Spicer\u2019s ridiculous response, the press secretary berated her. When she shook her head, he expressed umbrage. \u201cYou\u2019re shaking your head.\u201d And when she asked another question, only to fetch another unsatisfactory answer, she shook her head. \u201cPlease stop shaking your head again,\u201d instructed Spicer.\n\nAlong with her colleagues in the White House briefing room, Ryan is called upon to cover a proven racist and the policies that spring from his poisoned mind. She proceeds with gusto. \u201cFor the last 21 years that I\u2019ve been doing this I\u2019ve asked the same kinds of questions, literally, of Bill Clinton, of George W. Bush, and of Barack Obama, and now this president,\u201d Ryan said in a recent interview promoting her book, \u201cUnder Fire: Reporting from the Front Lines of the Trump White House.\u201d \u201cThe only question I never asked those presidents that I asked this president was \u2018Mr. President, are you a racist?'\u201d That question followed an alleged quip by Trump about immigrants from \u201cshithole countries.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Ryan asked the president about voter suppression. \u201cSit down,\u201d Trump scolded. Ryan explained the situation in a subsequent media appearance: \u201cYou know what that question was \u2026 it was voter suppression, and \u2026 he responded, \u2018Yeah, I got voter suppression or something like that,\u2019 and so I stood up. I thought he was receiving my question and wanted to talk about it, and then when he sees me, he says \u2018sit down\u2019 you know, in a very terse tone. I was taken aback,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump repeatedly tells April Ryan to \"sit down\" when she tries to ask him a question pic.twitter.com/6Th5pBxQtU \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) November 7, 2018\n\nAt a pre-midterm press conference, Ryan placed some important questions before press secretary Sarah Sanders:\n\n>@AprilDRyan brings desperately needed questions to WH press briefings. She just asked @presssec about Trump's calling Gillum a \"thief\" and also about voting rights in North Dakota. \u2014 ErikWemple (@ErikWemple) October 29, 2018\n\nQuestion-asking at the White House is a competitive industry. There are dozens of other reporters seeking to get a minute to have their say. To compound the difficulties, Trump and his emissaries provide non-answers as if there\u2019s a bonus system for doing so. Even within those decorum-inhibiting constraints, Ryan is forever respectful, collegial and insistent, though the White House sometimes has different interpretations.\n\n\u201cVery hostile. Such a hostile media. It\u2019s so sad,\u201d remarked Trump at his Wednesday presser after Ryan pursued her inquiry about voter suppression.\n\nThe same sentiments surfaced on Friday morning, as Trump took questions about his treatment of CNN Chief White House Correspondent Jim Acosta, whose pass to the building was yanked after a verbal tussle with Trump. Here\u2019s the riff:\n\nI think Jim Acosta is a very unprofessional man. He does this with everybody. He gets paid to bust in. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a smart person, but he\u2019s got a loud voice and as far as I\u2019m concerned\u2026.When you\u2019re in the White House, this is a very sacred place to be, this is a very special place. You have to treat the White House with respect, you have to treat the presidency with respect. If you\u2019ve ever seen him dealing with Sarah Huckabee Sanders, it\u2019s a disgrace. And he does it for, you know, the reason, the same thing with April Ryan. I watch her get up. I mean, you talk about somebody that\u2019s a loser. She doesn\u2019t know what the hell she\u2019s doing. She gets publicity, and then she gets a pay raise or she gets a contract, I think it\u2019s with CNN. She\u2019s very nasty and she shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nIs that all you got on April Ryan, President Trump? Just some resentment about a black woman getting ahead in the world? There seems to be plenty of such sentiment swirling in Trump\u2019s head. After black CNN reporter Abby Phillip asked Trump about his possible interest in reining in the special counsel investigation, he replied, \u201cWhat a stupid question. But I watch you a lot. You ask a lot of stupid questions.\u201d And don\u2019t forget how the president, also on Wednesday, treated Yamiche Alcindor, a black journalist with PBS NewsHour: She asked about the racial implications of adopting a \u201cnationalist\u201d stance. \u201cThat\u2019s such a racist question,\u201d he said. \u201cI love our country \u2026 We have nationalists and globalists. \u2026 I\u2019m very offended by that question.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Brian Stelter said in a segment Friday morning, \u201cThe president has a problem here.

Moments later, their arms made contact. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nColumnist\n\nI don\u2019t cover politics, or the White House, or media. But I have written about assaults against women, including the Brett Kavanaugh accusations, and clearly I\u2019d achieved some kind of lady-arbiter status in the mind of a reader who emailed me Wednesday.\n\nHe demanded I write a column \u201ccondemning\u201d CNN correspondent Jim Acosta for \u201cassaulting the young woman.\u201d It would be, the reader insisted, the \u201cfair-minded\u201d thing to do.\n\nSo I did what everyone else was doing and replayed the footage, Zapruder-style, from the chaotic briefing earlier that day. In it, a White House staffer reached for Acosta\u2019s microphone. Acosta\u2019s gesticulating arm simultaneously descended. Of course this wasn\u2019t assault. This was a forearm already on a downward trajectory; this was Newton\u2019s First Law.\n\n\u201cDo you genuinely, in your heart, believe it was assault?\u201d I wrote back.\n\nBy then, the White House had revoked Acosta\u2019s credentials for, as Sarah Sanders tweeted, \u201cplacing his hands\u201d on a \u201cyoung woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern.\u201d\n\nBy then, of course, it was clear we weren\u2019t talking about Acosta at all. We were talking about the fact that for a dispiriting number of people, including in the White House, assault is merely an abstract concept to be strategically wielded. As if the game isn\u2019t to hope nobody abuses women but to hope your political opponents abuse a lot of them.\n\nThe people who want to label Wednesday\u2019s news conference as an assault are only revealing how profoundly they do not understand assault. Or, less charitably, they don\u2019t believe it should be taken seriously when it seriously happens. It should only be taken seriously when it can be used to score points.\n\nChristine Blasey Ford\u2019s accusation against Kavanaugh? That, apparently, wasn\u2019t about a terrible thing that allegedly happened to a scared teenage girl. That was about a conspiracy designed to bring down the president\u2019s Supreme Court nominee.\n\nThe dozen-plus women who accused President Trump of sexual misconduct? Those weren\u2019t about a wealthy mogul allegedly treating women like playthings. Those, apparently, were about a conspiracy designed to make sure that man didn\u2019t become president.\n\nDo you remember when a Breitbart News reporter, Michelle Fields, was grabbed so hard by Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski that she had bruises on her arm? I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d classify the incident as an assault \u2014 but Trump\u2019s response was first to call it \u201cmade up\u201d and, later, when video proof emerged, to claim Fields had been grabbing him.\n\n[From 2016: The Trump campaign\u2019s war on reality made me question what I saw]\n\nOn Wednesday, it seemed as if Sanders was vaguely aware that assaulting and harassing women is currently frowned upon, and that \u201cbelieving women\u201d is in vogue, and so she created a Mad Libs tweet that would evoke as many key triggers as possible. She also shared a video of the encounter that had been doctored \u2014 sped up to make it look like the arm contact was intentional and eliminating Acosta\u2019s \u201cPardon me, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nNote, in Sanders\u2019s statement, the use of \u201cplacing his hands,\u201d which implies intentional, palms-down touching. Note \u201cintern,\u201d which reinforces the idea of a power imbalance. Note \u201ctrying to do her job,\u201d which calls back to the thousands of women in the \u00ad#MeToo movement who have shared stories about the times when their hard-fought careers were hindered by harassment.\n\nRead the tweet, and you might get the impression Acosta was following a teenager around with his hands duct-taped to her butt. Watch the video, though, and \u2014 well, if this is \u201cassault,\u201d I personally assaulted three people on my crowded commute home last night.\n\n(In fairness, I also didn\u2019t quite get it when some liberals blew a gasket over a video clip of \u00adKavanaugh nudging his wife aside \u2014 shoving! they cried \u2014 so he could hug his daughters at his swearing-in. I know married couples who elbow each other more vigorously in an attempt to reach the microwave. Still: I have somewhat higher expectations for the White House press secretary than for random goofballs on Twitter.)\n\nLast week, pro-Trump conspiracy theorists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman called a news conference, announcing they were in contact with a woman who said she\u2019d been raped by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. The smear job quickly unraveled into a confederacy of dunces: The woman didn\u2019t exist. Other women came forward to say they\u2019d been offered money to tell false tales about Mueller.\n\nThey thought a roomful of journalists and the good people of America would take a convoluted rape allegation at face value. They thought nobody would do a reverse Google image search on the fake investigative firm\u2019s fake employees, or bother to dial its phone number (which turned out to belong to Wohl\u2019s mom). And they thought they could find women happy to ruin a man\u2019s life for a few dollars, because allegations are all part of a gotcha game, right?\n\nAll they ended up revealing was that journalists employ standards and logic before repeating allegations against men. And that supporters of the #MeToo movement fear false allegations as much as anyone, because they understand how quickly progress would be wiped away by even one \u00adhigh-profile lie.\n\nI wish the Jim Acosta example wasn\u2019t a Jim Acosta example \u2014 one that makes it look like I\u2019m only interested in defending journalists, or in defending people who ask the president critical questions.\n\nBecause the larger point has nothing to do with who brushed whose arm away and who took away whose White House access.\n\nThe larger point is that violence against women shouldn\u2019t be a thing you get to gin up using doctored video. It\u2019s not a thing you get to dismiss when it\u2019s inconvenient.\n\nViolence against women isn\u2019t a point-scoring gift for politicians. Astonishingly enough, violence against women is a thing that happens to women.\n\nMonica Hesse is a columnist writing about gender and its impact on society.

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nFor years, Fox News and the right-wing echo chamber told audiences that \u201celites\u201d didn\u2019t get \u201creal America.\u201d They\u2019d point to Hollywood stars or progressive politicians, declaring they were out-of-touch with the woes of white, non-college-educated people in small towns and rural locales. White, upper-middle-class conservatives went along for the ride, happy to swipe at liberal media, academia and activist courts.\n\nElites did them wrong, the guys in the Rust Belt diner told countless reporters (those same \u201celites,\u201d who seemed so willing to transcribe their complaints). Immigrants were stealing their jobs. (Well, actually there were hardly any immigrants in places most of the viewers lived, and Fox News\u2019s upscale viewers had fine jobs.) The North American Free Trade Agreement stole their jobs, although unemployment rates were falling. Christianity was under attack, although churches and church groups flourished in their neighborhoods. Everyone else \u2014 immigrants, journalists, city dwellers, scientists, government workers, college-educated Americans \u2014 were somehow part of the elite cabal, out to destroy their way of life.\n\nIn fact, we\u2019re all part of \u201creal America.\u201d The victims and the neighborhood that comforted the victims in Pittsburgh\u2019s Squirrel Hill are real Americans. The college-educated women who marched the day after the inauguration and then signed up to help on a campaign or even ran for office themselves are real Americans. The immigrant who runs the corner grocery store, the non-churchgoers, the service workers in big cities, the environmental scientists working to develop alternatives to fossil fuels, the office workers who walk into state and government offices all over the country to help their fellow citizens, the parents of kids who are now scarily sophisticated about mass shootings, and others of every race and ethnicity are all real Americans.\n\nThese real Americans, who don\u2019t watch hours of Fox News, figured out long ago that Trump is a pathological liar. They recoil at his overt racism, know dictators always go after the free press, understand basic science, know Russia and Saudi Arabia are run by despots, don\u2019t see Canada as our enemy, recognize that crime is at historically low levels and know actual immigrants personally. What\u2019s more, they vote, and they outnumber the Trump-faithful.\n\nFor over two years, Trump and his Fox News helpmates have perpetrated the fraud that only they are the voice of \u201cthe people.\u201d That\u2019s what authoritarian regimes and their followers always say. Trump spent two years talking almost exclusively to and for his core group. Sure enough, he can get them out to vote in Missouri, Indiana and North Carolina. But they aren\u2019t a majority of voters nationwide; not even close. His demagoguery, lies, cruelty and incompetence \u2014 what his supporters ignore or even relish (he\u2019s our liar!) \u2014 the majority, a large majority, of equally real Americans despises.\n\nThe 2018 midterm elections are a reminder that presidents and parties have to talk to the whole country. The midterms are also a lesson that victimology only goes so far.\n\nThere are true victims in America \u2014 opioid addicts, gun victims, sexual assault survivors, cancer patients, victims of police misconduct, children without stable homes. The 70-year-old white male in the top 10 percent of income earners isn\u2019t a victim, no matter what Sean Hannity tells him. You\u2019re not a victim if someone tells you \u201cHappy Holidays\u201d or you hear a \u201cPress 2 for Spanish\u201d option on the phone. You\u2019re not a victim if more and more Americans don\u2019t \u201clook like you\u201d; looking like you has never been a qualification for citizenship. You\u2019re not a victim if gays marry or transgender kids get to use the restroom of their choice at school. The price of living \u2014 the requirement of living \u2014 in a diverse democracy is tolerance, self-discipline, civility and a minimal amount of civic comprehension.\n\nIf Tuesday was about anything, it was a restatement that no American is more real than another. Yes, the majority of Americans are decent, tolerant, fair-minded people, and no one should sink into self-pity and grievance based on their inability to dominate the culture, economy and politics. We are all in this together; we deserve leaders who understand that.\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: Nice democracy you\u2019ve got there\n\nJennifer Rubin: Three days later: Hey, Republicans really did get clobbered\n\nEugene Robinson: \u2018Real\u2019 Americans are a myth.

(Dmitri Lovetsky/AP)\n\nThe Russians move fast. After one of their rockets malfunctioned last month, triggering an automatic abort, Roscosmos, the country\u2019s space agency, says it knows what happened and how to fix it. Instead of delaying the next flight with astronauts \u2014 originally scheduled for Dec. 20\u2014 it is moving up the launch to Dec. 3.\n\nConfident in its Russian counterpart, NASA has signed off on this. And Anne McClain, the American astronaut up next in the flight rotation, says she is ready to strap in and go. \u201cI would have gotten on the Soyuz the next day,\u201d she told reporters Friday.\n\nOn Oct. 11, a Russian Soyuz rocket suffered a failure less than three minutes into flight when one of the side boosters failed to separate properly and slammed into the rocket.\n\nRoscosmos has said that the mishap was caused by a \u201cdeformed\u201d sensor damaged during the rocket\u2019s assembly that caused the booster separation problem. Since the accident, Russia has flown the Soyuz three times without crews successfully, restoring confidence in the system.\n\nIn an interview Friday, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said Roscosmos has been \u201cvery transparent. They have shared with us all the data we need to be comfortable and confident that we understand the problem and that it has been resolved.\u201d\n\n[Companies in the Cosmos: Explore the new space race]\n\nHe said the flight was moved up to \u201cget our crew up there as soon as possible\u201d since the last mission failed. Scott Kelly, the former NASA astronaut who spent nearly a year in space, said that made sense given that two of three crew members on the next flight were \u201crookies\u201d who had never been to space. Getting to the station early would \u201cgive the crew time to do an effective handover,\" he said. \u201cI could see why they\u2019d want to move that flight earlier if they could safely do that.\u201d\n\nAlthough harrowing, the last mission was viewed within NASA as a \u201cvery successful failed launch,\u201d as Bridenstine said, since the crews returned to Earth safely. After the booster collided with the rocket, the spacecraft instantaneously jettisoned away from the rocket, carrying the astronauts \u2014 one Russian, one American \u2014 on a wild ride near the edge of space.\n\nDuring the escape, the pair were slammed back into their seats and experienced 7 Gs, or seven times the force of gravity. NASA astronaut Nick Hague recently told reporters the first thing he noticed \u201cwas being shaken violently from side to side. The alarm sounded, a light flashed and \u201conce I saw the light, I knew we had an emergency with the booster.\u201d\n\nHague and his Russian counterpart, Alexey Ovchinin, were also found immediately by rescue teams, a much better outcome than a notorious launch abort in 1975 when Soviet Union cosmonauts landed in a remote part of eastern Russia on the snowy slope of a mountain and nearly tumbled off a cliff. (They were located a day later.) But even when aborts go right, they still are not supposed to happen in the first place. This was perilously close to what is known in space industry lingo as a \u201cbad day.\u201d Space travel is inherently risky, but NASA and its partners try to buy down the risk.\n\nIt appears to be a \u201cfairly straightforward assembly error they made as they put the rocket together,\u201d said Wayne Hale, former manager of NASA\u2019s space shuttle program. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the basic design.\u201d\n\nThe mishap follows the discovery of a small, drilled hole of mysterious origin in one section.\n\nThe hole is the subject of a separate investigation by Roscosmos. The Russians have floated the idea of sabotage. The hole had been clumsily patched after it had been created, and when the patch failed a small leak of air from the station triggered alarms. The hole has since been patched again and is not considered a threat to the Soyuz\u2019s reentry because it\u2019s in a section of the spacecraft that is jettisoned in space.\n\nThe two anomalies \u2014 the launch failure and the Soyuz hole \u2014 are almost surely unrelated, according to industry experts. But this is a business that would like its current number of anomalies under investigation to be zero, not two.\n\nBridenstine said the pair of problems \u201craises questions\u201d but didn\u2019t want to comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nThe incidents also serve as a reminder that the Soyuz is the only way humans can get to the International Space Station. If the Soyuz were to be grounded for an extended period of time NASA and its partners may have to abandon the station temporarily.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put the crew at risk to keep it crewed,\u201d said Mike Suffredini, the president and CEO of Axiom Space, which is developing private space stations.\n\nSimilarly, a NASA safety advisory panel last month said that with the desire to stay on schedule \u201cthere is the potential for the workforce \u2014 striving to meet unrealistic dates and pressures to \u2018get on with it' \u2014 will subtly erode sound decision-making as proposed launch dates approach.\u201d\n\nMcClain said she had confidence that Roscosmos had fixed the problem by asking \u201cthe three important questions: What Happened? Why did it happen? And how do we ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again? Nobody was going to give a green light until those three questions were answered.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAstronauts make harrowing escape, but Russian rocket failure roils NASA\n\nNASA Chief: \u2018No changes\u2019 to space station launches after dramatic Soyuz rocket failure\n\nRussia blames rocket failure on mistake during assembly", "Opinion writer\n\nWhile much of the post-election attention is being sucked up by vote-counting chaos in Florida (who could have predicted it), there\u2019s another Senate race with an ongoing dispute over votes that may have escaped your attention. This race\u2019s conclusion might help upend the conventional wisdom about the 2018 election.\n\nAnd guess what, Republicans are suing to prevent all the votes from being counted:\n\nAs the Arizona Senate vote count starts to tip into Democratic terrain, a judge Friday will hear a lawsuit by the GOP seeking to limit the tally \u2014 or expand it in the state\u2019s conservative-leaning rural areas. Four local Republican parties filed a lawsuit Wednesday night challenging the state\u2019s two biggest counties for allowing voters to help resolve problems with their mail-in ballot signatures after Election Day. If the signature on the voter registration doesn\u2019t match that on the sealed envelope, both Maricopa and Pima County allow voters to help them fix, or \u201ccure\u201d it, up to five days after Election Day.\n\nWe seem to see the same pattern over and over again: A race is extremely close, Democrats demand that every vote be counted, and Republicans, having spent the time leading up to the election putting up as many hurdles as possible to voting, particularly among minority groups, try to shut down the counting before all the votes can be counted. This effort is carried out with lawsuits and through an intense propaganda campaign roping in every Republican with a functioning larynx and often centered on Fox News, where the president\u2019s good friend Sean Hannity is whipping himself into hysterical outrage and demanding that \u201cSomebody needs to go to jail here\u201d because votes are still being counted in Florida.\n\nSo what\u2019s taking so long in Arizona? On election night, Republican Martha McSally led the Senate race there, a result which helped solidify a narrative in the media that while Democrats did well to win control of the House, Republicans practically ran the table in the Senate and because of that the election was basically a wash. That narrative is completely wrong, which I\u2019ll elaborate on in a moment, but as of now, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema is leading McSally by just over 9,000 votes.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know if that will hold, because there still appear to be hundreds of thousands of votes to count. Things are moving so slowly in Arizona because the state counts the election day votes first, then moves on to the early and mail-in votes, which make up most of the votes in the state. That\u2019s why Maricopa County \u2014 which accounts for more than half of Arizona voters \u2014 has hundreds of thousands of ballots still to count. Here\u2019s one incredible detail from the county\u2019s chief election official:\n\nFontes said his office\u2019s 1980s-era computer system is partly to blame. It was put in when Maricopa was far smaller and only a handful of its residents voted by mail. He said the system only allows his office to tally about 75,000 votes a day. There are another 375,000 votes outstanding in Maricopa County alone as of Thursday night.\n\nThe tally in Maricopa is extremely close, with Sinema slightly leading, so anything could happen.\n\nNow let\u2019s consider that narrative, which you no doubt saw, of Republicans doing surprisingly well in the Senate which led overall to an election that was almost a tie.\n\nFirst, Democrats look like they will gain around 35 seats in the House \u2014 more than they did in the \u201cwave\u201d of 2006 and enough to give them control of the chamber, utterly transforming the political landscape for the remainder of Trump\u2019s term. But let\u2019s take a close look at the Senate.\n\nThe Senate map Democrats faced this year was absolutely brutal. They had to defend 26 Senate seats, while Republicans only had to defend 9. Democrats were certainly unhappy to lose three incumbents in Missouri, Indiana, and North Dakota, but those are all hugely Republican states (Trump won them by 36 points, 19 points, and 19 points respectively). If we assume Synema holds on to win, that would mean Democrats won 7 races in states Trump won, while Republicans won zero races in states Trump lost. Zero.\n\nIf Synema does hold on to win, it would mean that with all their advantages, Republicans managed a net gain of only two Senate seats. And since the Florida race is headed for a recount, it is entirely possible that in the end they could wind up having gained only one seat.\n\nNow combine that with all the other victories Democrats notched. They flipped 7 governorships from red to blue, while Republicans took no governorships held by Democrats. They gained \u201ctrifectas\u201d (holding the governor and both houses of the state legislature) in 6 states, and broke Republican trifectas in 4 more. They gained well over 300 state legislative seats and now control a majority of the country\u2019s attorney generals. And progressive ballot initiatives on voting rights, Medicaid expansion, marijuana legalization, and the minimum wage won in states across the country.\n\nAnd they managed it all in the face of relentless Republican voter suppression efforts, which start long before election day and, as we\u2019re seeing now, continue after election day is past. It\u2019s probably too late for those efforts to yield any fruit in Arizona, but as Florida shows us, they won\u2019t ever stop trying to rig things in their favor.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump\u2019s authoritarian response to Florida shenanigans hints at worse to come\n\nDemocratic legitimacy is on the line in Georgia\n\nAndrew Gillum\u2019s defeat: Florida\u2019s dark racial past reared its head once again\n\nHow the GOP might win in 2020\n\nMatthew Whitaker is a crackpot\n\nThe Kavanaugh debacle cost the Democrats the Senate", "\n\nMichelle Obama speaks at a rally for Hillary Clinton in November 2016. (Photo by NICHOLAS KAMM / AFP) (Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIn a week that saw tremendous gains for women in public office, Michelle Obama just broke another major barrier.\n\nThe former first lady, in an interview promoting her forthcoming memoir, shared a painful and personal secret: She and Barack Obama struggled with infertility, had a miscarriage and used in vitro fertilization (IVF) to have their two daughters, Malia and Sasha.\n\n[In revealing new memoir, Michelle Obama candidly shares her story]\n\nWhat makes her story so remarkable is not that she and her husband had issues with fertility, but that she\u2019s now talking about it and opening the door for the millions of women who had or currently have trouble conceiving to share their own stories.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the worst thing that we do to each other as women, not share the truth about our bodies and how they work, and how they don\u2019t work,\u201d Obama said in an interview Friday on \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\nMichelle Obama on her miscarriage 20 years ago: \u201cI think it\u2019s important to talk to young mothers about the fact that miscarriages happen.\u201d pic.twitter.com/STuPcGjBDz \u2014 Philip Lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) November 9, 2018\n\nThat this particular woman broached this subject could move the focus immediately to how public policy treats it. Obama\u2019s new willingness to discuss her previously secret struggles can shine a new light on the prevalence of infertility and the incredible emotional and financial cost of going through medical treatments to have a baby.\n\nWhile the Affordable Care Act, her husband\u2019s signature legislative achievement, mandated coverage of maternal health care, it did not require coverage of fertility treatments. Neither does Medicaid. And while 15 states have passed laws that insurers cover or offer coverage for infertility treatments, women in the remaining 35 states often must pay out of pocket if they hope to conceive. And even when it is covered, it\u2019s sometimes only partially, and still requires a massive outlay of cash that is out of reach for most people.\n\nIVF can cost as much as $20,000 a cycle, so the ability to have children becomes a question of means. In other words, only infertile couples with that kind of disposable income have full options when it comes to getting pregnant. It\u2019s perhaps the starkest example of health access disparities.\n\nIn May, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.) introduced legislation requiring insurers to cover infertility treatments without raising premiums or co-pays. The bill never went anywhere, but could find new life in a Democratic-led House with a record number of female members.\n\nMuch like mental health is an invisible illness that people often fear speaking about, so is infertility. Last year, the American Medical Association voted to follow the lead of the World Health Organization and designated infertility a disease, hoping it would promote more insurance coverage of treatments and less stigma.\n\nRichard Paulson, past president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, likened it to how people used to treat breast cancer.\n\n\u201cI remember an era when people didn\u2019t talk about breast cancer and it was only when celebrities came forward and took it out of the closet and demystified it,\u201d he said. \u201cInfertility is a legitimate disease and there\u2019s a cure for it and we have it.\u201d\n\nInfertility rates continue to rise as more and more women wait until later in life to start families. The Obamas were in their mid-30s when they went underwent IVF.\n\nThe worst-kept secret about infertility is just how common it is \u2014 as many as 1 in 8 couples have trouble getting pregnant or carrying a baby to term \u2014 but women still resist talking about it, often blaming themselves and silently carrying shame and anguish.\n\n\"Our culture is very hush-hush about reproduction and infertility in particular, it reaches to the very heart of our self-image, who we are and how we see ourselves. Many women still have that feeling that they are barren that they can\u2019t perform this basic thing. And for men, it feels it reflects on their potency and masculinity,\u201d Paulson said. \u201cBut it\u2019s unbelievably common, and to have it out in the open is wonderful.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, one in four pregnancies end in miscarriage \u2014 of the approximately 4 million pregnancies in the United States in a given year, that\u2019s as many as 1 million women. And yet, because most miscarriages occur in the first trimester when women often don\u2019t reveal their pregnancy, they go through the loss of that pregnancy in isolation.\n\nIt\u2019s a sad reality that Obama spoke to directly.\n\n\u201cI felt lost and alone and I felt like I failed, because I didn\u2019t know how common miscarriages were, because we don\u2019t talk about them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe sit in our own pain, thinking that somehow we\u2019re broken.\u201d\n\nObama isn\u2019t the first political figure to discuss openly her infertility. Earlier this year, Sen.

If your location is not quite at peak yet, you will be there over the next week.\n\nThe season started off extremely slowly \u2014 and it was generally subpar in the highest terrain well to the west \u2014 but we have managed to eke out good-quality color.\n\nRelatively persistent cool air over the past several weeks almost allowed areas east of the mountains to catch up to normal, as far as when the peak occurs. In and around the city, we ended up about a week late, and Veterans Day weekend is typically a very colorful time, as it will be this year.\n\nThe Nov. 8 update from the Fall Foliage Network shows high color to peak conditions across the region.

For instance, Maryland\u2019s Department of Natural Resources has the immediate area fully in peak. Among others, they share a report from state forester Brian Stupak that states, \"[w]e are in peak colors in Calvert and Prince George\u2019s counties.\u201d\n\n\n\nMaryland's reporting indicates northern parts of the state are past peak, with our region in peak color.

In others, there has arguably been more of an overlap of colors across tree types than in some years. Where there is color \u2014 and it is everywhere locally at this time \u2014 it has largely been vibrant.\n\nLike last week, we are looking at a storm system passing through the region as we drift into the weekend.

High temperatures will be in the 40s. Following a widespread hard freeze Saturday night, Sunday will offer more sunshine and calmer winds. Highs should reach the mid-40s to near 50.

(J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nFor two years, Senate Democrats from red states lived in fear for their political lives. Vote against repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and you\u2019ll lose your seat! Vote against Neil Gorsuch or Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, and you\u2019ll lose your seat! Vote for gun bills or against tax cuts, and you\u2019ll lose your seat! (Logically, this argument should have stop working once they voted the \u201cwrong\u201d way once or twice.) Well, some red-state Democrats certainly did lose.\n\nBut now the map turns. Senate Republicans from blue and purple states are up for reelection in 2020. Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine will face voters. So will Thom Tillis from North Carolina, where a Democratic governor will have a more Democratic state legislature. (\u201cDemocrats needed to flip four seats in the state House and six in the state Senate to break the Republican supermajority, which allows to the GOP to override vetoes issued by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. Democrats broke through by flipping seats around Raleigh, Charlotte and Greensboro. Wake County Republicans Nelson Dollar, Chris Malone, John Adcock and Tamara Barringer all lost.\u201d)\n\nMoreover, the few Republican House survivors in competitive seats in California, Pennsylvania, Florida and elsewhere will need to make the case to their constituents once more that they are not like those \u201cother\u201d Republicans.\n\nAll of that means that Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), most likely the next speaker of the House, should be able to force a series of votes in the House that put vulnerable Republicans in both the House and Senate in a bind.\n\nVote to shore up Obamacare? Well, even red-state voters like that now so, sure, pass something in the House and make Gardner, Tillis and others squirm. Pelosi also vows to pass \u201cbipartisan, commonsense solutions to prevent gun violence.\u201d It\u2019s not clear what that might entail, but Gardner, Collins, Tillis and the few surviving suburban House Republicans (especially those in Florida) are going to have a hard time explaining why they didn\u2019t vote for popular measures such as universal background checks.\n\nIn the same vein, Pelosi has a chance to put on the floor a compromise bill on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) that outgoing Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) would not \u2014 for fear that it would pass! Send that over to the Senate and see whether vulnerable Republican senators as well as colleagues from border states and/or from states with a sizable Hispanic population (e.g. John Cornyn of Texas, Jon Kyl of Arizona, Marco Rubio of Florida) have the nerve to vote against popular measures.\n\nAn infrastructure bill that House Republicans never managed to pass might come up again \u2014 with President Trump cheerleading for a bill he has wanted to pass since he took office. The very same Republicans who ran up the debt will scream about the expense \u2014 but might not have the nerve to vote against it when Gardner, Collins, Tillis and others start sweating.\n\nIf Pelosi and Democrats are very clever, they will even pass a tax bill that reallocates tax breaks from the super-rich or corporations to the middle class and that gives blue states back their uncapped state and local tax (SALT) deductions.\n\nIn some cases, Pelosi might be able to push legislation through that delights Democrats; in other cases, she will be helping sow dissension between Trump and Republican lawmakers \u2014 and between Republicans and their constituents. Having the House majority, you see, not only means that your party has control of the committees and subpoena power; it also means one controls the agenda. With Republicans in political retreat and crosswise with voters on key policy issues, that\u2019s a really big deal for Pelosi and her members.\n\nRead more:\n\nThree cheers for the moderates\n\nAcosta should sue the president, and Americans should shun Sanders\n\nThe real \u2018real America\u2019\n\nNice democracy you\u2019ve got there\n\nThree days later: Hey, Republicans really did get clobbered", "ONE OF ONE HUNDRED PHOTOS WORLD WAR ONE CENTENARY TIMELINE-In this June 28, 1914 file photo, the Archduke of Austria Franz Ferdinand, center right, and his wife Sophie, center left, walk to their a car in Sarajevo.

(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 list of conquered running backs seemed to grow each week and the defense checked them off with pride \u2014 David Johnson, Alvin Kamara, Christian McCaffrey, Ezekiel Elliott, Saquon Barkley. As the team dominated in the run game, however, top-notch receivers T.Y. Hilton, Devin Funchess, Odell Beckham Jr., Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley all posted yardage above their season averages against Washington.\n\nThe Redskins are one of top run-stopping teams in the league but rank No. 20 against the pass after getting lit up for 350 yards and four passing touchdowns against Matt Ryan and the Falcons. Things don\u2019t get easier this weekend against a Buccaneers receiving corps consisting of Mike Evans, former Redskin DeSean Jackson and tight end O.J. Howard.\n\nCoach Jay Gruden said there were lessons learned against Atlanta that can be applied to this week.\n\n\u201cYou know we have to do better on third down rushing the passer,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe had some pretty good third-down situations for us to get some pass rush and we didn\u2019t really take advantage of those situations. Matt [Ryan] had some time to throw and get to his first, second, third read. They ran some very good pick routes and got free. We have to clean up some of our \u2026 if we're going to play man-to-man, clear up some of our combination coverages and go from there.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s going to be a great challenge. Evans is a heck of a receiver. Obviously, DeSean, [Chris] Godwin and O.J., so we [have to] cover them up, mix in some zones and rush the passer.\u201d\n\n[Nothing\u2019s wrong with Alex Smith, and that\u2019s a sobering fact for Redskins]\n\nThe secondary recently has been somewhat in flux. Starting cornerback Quinton Dunbar has missed two games with a nerve issue in his lower leg and has not practiced this week. That left rookies Greg Stroman and Danny Johnson filling in with varied degrees of success. The team brought in Pro Bowl safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix at the trade deadline and he started that same week. Cornerback Josh Norman had played well after some early-season struggles, but was not at his best against the Falcons.\n\nFox Sports analyst and former NFL linebacker Chris Spielman said the rules and the ways offenses are constructed make it difficult for a team to consistently shut down these upper-echelon receivers. Sometimes a win is simply eliminating the big play and tightening up once offenses reach the red zone. Spielman, who is scheduled to call the game, also stressed the need for the secondary to get help from the defensive line in the form of quarterback pressure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to cover guys in this league,\u201d Spielman said. \u201cGuys are going to get yards.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to get challenged. If you can get pressure, especially if you can get it with four, that gives you seven on the back end, and \u2026 [have] good open-field tackling.\u201d\n\n[Redskins-Buccaneers matchups: Five keys to Sunday\u2019s game]\n\nTampa Bay features the No. 1 passing offense in the league, averaging 356.6 yards per game, and its 446.8 total yards per game ranks No. 2.

(Jeremy Drey/Reading Eagle/AP)\n\nWith a number of races yet to be called, Democrats are on track to pick up as many as 37 House seats as a result of this year\u2019s midterm elections. As many observers have pointed out, that total could have been even higher had it not been for Republican gerrymandering in some states. A comparison of the 2018 House results in two states in particular \u2014 North Carolina and Pennsylvania \u2014 provides a vivid illustration of the power of gerrymandering to skew election results.\n\nGerrymandering happens when partisan lawmakers draw legislative districts in a way to disadvantage political opponents, either by packing them all up in a small number of districts to contain their influence, or splitting them across multiple districts to dilute their political clout. To see how it works in practice, look no farther than North Carolina and Pennsylvania, where after the 2010 Census Republicans drew maps to give themselves huge political advantages in U.S. House races.\n\nJust how lopsided? In 2016, Democrats in North Carolina won 47 percent of the statewide popular House vote but took home 23 percent of the seats. Pennsylvania Democrats, meanwhile, won 48 percent of the statewide vote in contested House elections but 27 percent of the seats. Big differences between popular votes and seat totals are one of the telltale signs of a heavily gerrymandered state.\n\nBut the two states' paths diverged after 2016. North Carolina held on to its gerrymandered districts for the 2018 election, just barely, despite multiple court rulings decreeing that the maps are unconstitutional. In Pennsylvania, on the other hand, the state Supreme Court redrew the maps earlier this year, in time for the election, creating a much more competitive electoral landscape.\n\nThe difference in the outcome at the ballot box is striking.\n\n\n\n(Illustration by Christopher Ingraham for the Washington Post)\n\nNorth Carolina, where the old maps were still in place, got an electoral result in 2018 that\u2019s virtually identical to that of 2016. Despite a Democratic wave in which more than half the state\u2019s voters opted for a Democratic House candidate, Democrats won one-quarter of the contested seats.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, on the other hand, a 53 percent majority in the popular vote yielded a hair under half of the contested seats \u2014 a big difference from 2016, when 48 percent of the vote gave Democrats 27 percent of the seats.\n\nI\u2019m using the word \u201ccontested\u201d deliberately \u2014 in a small number of races in these states in these years, one of the major parties didn\u2019t field a candidate. I\u2019ve excluded those races from this analysis, since they result in ballots cast for only one political party.\n\nI\u2019ve focused on these two states because they were frequently rated as the most gerrymandered states in the nation on a number of different measures, and because they saw intense litigation and public debate over gerrymandering this year. They both happen to be GOP gerrymanders, although it\u2019s worth pointing out that Democrats have a record of doing this, too \u2014 Maryland being the most noteworthy example.\n\nConsidering all seats in these two states, contested and otherwise, Pennsylvania\u2019s House delegation moved from 11 Republicans and seven Democrats before the election to a 9-9 split after, a result that\u2019s much more in line with the statewide popular vote than in previous years.\n\nIn North Carolina, however, the results are unchanged: Democrats held three seats before the midterms, and they\u2019ll hold three seats afterward, despite increasing their state popular vote share in contested elections by a full 5 percentage points.\n\nIn these abstract discussions of seats and vote tallies it\u2019s easy to lose track of what this means from a governance perspective. Judge James A. Wynn Jr. of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit offered some big-picture perspective in a ruling against the constitutionality of North Carolina\u2019s gerrymandered map earlier this year. He lamented that voters in the state \u201chave been deprived of a constitutional congressional districting plan \u2014 and, therefore, constitutional representation in Congress.\u201d\n\nProper representation in Congress is one of the cornerstones of U.S. democracy \u2014 the whole system is built upon it. Gerrymandering gnaws away at that representation, making it difficult for voters to elect a government that represents their will.\n\nOne underappreciated aspect of Tuesday\u2019s elections is a shift in the balance of redistricting power, from Republicans toward Democrats and independent commissions. If Democrats continue to build on those gains in 2020, it\u2019ll be a chance to see whether they\u2019re truly interested in drawing fairer maps or whether they just want to tip the scales in their favor.", "Attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union and other immigrant advocacy groups filed suit Friday in the Northern District of California to block the Trump administration\u2019s plan to deny asylum protections to migrants who cross the Mexico border illegally.\n\nThe suit accuses the administration of attempting to violate the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging that Trump administration officials have improperly rushed to implement the new restrictions while also asserting executive powers that lie beyond the scope of what the Supreme Court upheld in its \u201ctravel ban\u201d decision this year.\n\nThe suit came hours after Trump issued a decree Friday morning that set in motion his administration\u2019s effort to close off asylum benefits for those who enter the United States illegally. The measures are to take effect Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe asylum ban is not justified by events on the ground, puts lives in danger and is patently unlawful,\u201d said Lee Gelernt, an ACLU attorney. \u201cThe administration is flagrantly ignoring a federal statute and bypassing the most basic procedural requirements governing the issuance of new laws.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials have anticipated the lawsuits, and the possibility that lower courts will side with the plaintiffs. The administration has suffered repeated defeats in district courts in California, but administration officials view the rulings as necessary hurdles to reach the Supreme Court, which by a 5-to-4 vote in June upheld a revised version of the travel ban that sought to block foreigners from several Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States.\n\n[Trump administration tightens asylum rules as caravans continue north]\n\nUnder the new measures, announced by administration officials Thursday, Trump seeks to exercise the same emergency authority invoked during his \u201ctravel ban\u201d of early 2017 to bar anyone crossing the Mexico border illegally from qualifying for asylum.\n\nProtections for asylum seekers will remain available to those who apply at official border crossings, or U.S. ports of entry, and the restrictions would not apply to underage asylum seekers who arrive without a parent or guardian.\n\nIn his proclamation, Trump said the measures were necessary to prepare for the arrival of thousands of Central Americans traveling in groups through Mexico toward the U.S. border with what he said was no apparent \u201clawful basis for admission into our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe arrival of large numbers of aliens will contribute to the overloading of our immigration and asylum system and to the release of thousands of aliens into the interior of the United States,\u201d the proclamation states.\n\n\u201cThe continuing and threatened mass migration of aliens with no basis for admission into the United States through our southern border has precipitated a crisis and undermines the integrity of our borders,\u201d it continues. \u201cI therefore must take immediate action to protect the national interest, and to maintain the effectiveness of the asylum system for legitimate asylum seekers who demonstrate that they have fled persecution and warrant the many special benefits associated with asylum.\u201d\n\nAsylum claims have increased fourfold since 2014, compounding a backlog of more than 750,000 cases in U.S. immigration courts.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s emergency restrictions would still allow those seeking refuge to potentially qualify for a lesser legal status known as \u201cwithholding of removal\u201d that would spare them, on a provisional basis, from deportation.\n\nThat status would not provide a chance at legal permanent residency or citizenship, but it would give those who enter illegally a way to avoid being sent back to Central America if they can convince a U.S. asylum officer that they face a \u201creasonable fear\u201d of persecution.\n\nAccording to the White House proclamation issued Friday, the asylum restrictions will remain in effect for 90 days and would terminate if the government of Mexico agrees to a long-standing U.S. request to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement to deport Central Americans to Mexico if they have entered from Mexican territory.\n\nThe Mexican government has given no indication it plans to do so.\n\nAn estimated 7,000 to 10,000 Central Americans are currently en route through Mexico in \u201ccaravan\u201d groups, the largest of which is preparing to depart Mexico City after resting several days at a sports complex there.\n\nMexican authorities say nearly 5,000 migrants are traveling with that group, the vast majority of whom are from Honduras, where the caravan originated. More than 1,700 are younger than 18, and at last 300 are younger than 5.\n\nMany say they are fleeing gang violence or death threats and plan to request humanitarian protections in the United States. Others acknowledge they are seeking jobs or reunion with family members \u2014 motivations that would not qualify them for asylum under U.S. law.\n\nThe group is planning to travel more than 1,000 miles to the U.S. border crossing at Tijuana, a journey that could take several weeks if caravan members continue walking and hitchhiking most of the way.\n\nLarge numbers of Central Americans already are lined up in informal queues in the Tijuana area, because U.S. customs officers limit the number of asylum seekers allowed to approach the border crossing each day, citing capacity and personnel limits.\n\nSenior administration officials gave no indication they plan to increase resources and personnel in the San Diego area to cope with a potentially large increase in the number of people approaching the ports of entry.\n\nOne Department of Homeland Security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity at his agency\u2019s insistence, criticized the caravan\u2019s decision to take a much longer route toward San Diego, instead of approaching the U.S. border in South Texas, which is much closer geographically.\n\n\u201cThe premise that individuals who are supposed to be fleeing persecution with legitimate claims of persecution would make a decision to, instead of presenting themselves for protection in Mexico or at the closest U.S. ports of entry, travel an additional 1,000 miles to a specific port of entry to pursue their claim calls into question the legitimacy\u201d of that claim, the official said.\n\nThe longer route to Tijuana is considered safer for migrants who cannot afford a smuggling guide. Shorter routes to the Rio Grande Valley along the Texas border are under the control of criminal groups who routinely kill and kidnap those who do not pay tolls for passing through territory under their control.", "President Trump doesn\u2019t exactly have a great track record when it comes to high-profile appointments \u2014 remember Ronny L. Jackson? \u2014 and the hasty installation of Matthew G. Whitaker as acting attorney general looks like it ranks up there.\n\nEver since Whitaker was tapped to replace ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday, red flags have been popping up. And in nearly every major facet of Sessions\u2019s removal and Whitaker\u2019s appointment \u2014 the legality of it, the appearance of it, the prosecution of it and Whitaker\u2019s background \u2014 those red flags are significant.\n\nThe first issue was the timing. Doing this the day after the midterm elections pretty much erased any doubt that this was delayed for political reasons and then done as quickly as possible. Sessions reportedly wanted to stay on until Friday, but White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly told him no.\n\nWhy was that? It\u2019s important to point out that the Justice Department tries not to do anything publicly in the weeks before an election, which is why special counsel Robert S. Mueller III has been quiet. But that leaves open the possibility that notable actions have been on hold, and Friday is usually the day indictments are revealed. It\u2019s not illogical to think Trump wanted Whitaker to take oversight of the Russia probe before potential indictments of Roger Stone and even Donald Trump Jr. were handed down \u2014 or something else.\n\nAll of which is speculative. But it\u2019s not at all difficult to paint Whitaker as a stooge for Trump in the Justice Department \u2014 or at least someone Trump had to know sided with him on substantial, Russia-related matters. Thanks to his brief career as a pundit, Whitaker has taken Trump\u2019s side on many aspects of the Russia investigation. He even appeared to absolve Trump Jr. of any wrongdoing for the Trump Tower meeting \u2014 \u201cYou would always take that meeting,\u201d Whitaker told CNN last year \u2014 and mused about someone in the position where he now finds himself defunding Mueller\u2019s probe. At one point, Whitaker even seemed to suggest Russia hadn\u2019t interfered at all \u2014 a stance at odds with the consensus of the U.S. intelligence community but one that was possibly music to Trump\u2019s ears.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s commentary might as well be that of Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and Trump\u2019s House Republican allies; it\u2019s not what you\u2019d expect from someone set to make massively consequential decisions about Mueller\u2019s probe. Whitaker made these pronouncements without knowing what kind of evidence Mueller has, which is called prejudging a case, but he has no intention of recusing himself as Sessions did. Even if he can neutrally oversee the Russia investigation from here on out, the mere appearance of prejudgment is problematic. We\u2019d never know whether Trump Jr. would have been indicted without Whitaker as acting AG, but that question will linger. We\u2019ll never really know.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s commentary, though, isn\u2019t the only issue with his background. So, too, is his work on the board of an invention assistance company, World Patent Marketing, that the Federal Trade Commission has labeled a \u201cscam.\u201d Here\u2019s The Post\u2019s Carol D. Leonnig, Rosalind S. Helderman and Robert O\u2019Harrow Jr.:\n\nWhatever the concept, no matter how banal or improbable, investigators found, the salesperson would pronounce the idea fantastic and encourage the customer to pay for a package to market and patent the idea, documents show. Many people ended up in debt or lost their life savings, according to the FTC.\n\nWhitaker has never personally been accused of wrongdoing, nor has the company admitted any; a settlement didn\u2019t require it to do so. But these are all issues that would be of significant interest in a confirmation hearing. Because of Trump\u2019s maneuver and Whitaker\u2019s \u201cacting\u201d status \u2014 which could allow him to serve more than 200 days \u2014 we\u2019ll never get a thorough public vetting of the man leading the Justice Department.\n\nWhich brings us to the next problem: whether this appointment is even legal. George Conway (husband of White House adviser Kellyanne Conway) and former solicitor general Neal Katyal argued Thursday in the New York Times that it\u2019s not. They argue, compellingly, that the Constitution explicitly requires principal officers of the U.S. government \u2014 that is, those who have no superior except the president \u2014 to be confirmed:\n\nA principal officer must be confirmed by the Senate. And that has a very significant consequence today. It means that Mr. Trump\u2019s installation of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general of the United States after forcing the resignation of Jeff Sessions is unconstitutional. It\u2019s illegal. And it means that anything Mr. Whitaker does, or tries to do, in that position is invalid. ... In times of crisis, interim appointments need to be made. Cabinet officials die, and wars and other tragic events occur. It is very difficult to see how the current situation comports with those situations. And even if it did, there are officials readily at hand, including the deputy attorney general and the solicitor general, who were nominated by Mr. Trump and confirmed by the Senate. Either could step in as acting attorney general, both constitutionally and statutorily.\n\nToss that on top of the appearance problems, the background problems and the timing problems, and Whitaker\u2019s appointment runs the gamut. Which made it interesting Friday morning when Trump seemed to distance himself from Whitaker.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Matt Whitaker,\u201d Trump said, when asked whether he had talked to Whitaker about Mueller\u2019s investigation. \u201cMatt Whitaker worked for Jeff Sessions, and he was always extremely highly thought of, and still is.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not true that Trump doesn\u2019t know Whitaker. He has reportedly been present for several Oval Office meetings with Trump, alongside Sessions. But more important, why is Trump distancing himself? The most probable explanation is that he doesn\u2019t want it to look as if he put his guy in a position to influence the investigation into his own campaign. But it also seems possible Trump sees the growing questions about Whitaker\u2019s background and wants to make sure they don\u2019t come back to bite him. At the least, it would seem to bode poorly for Whitaker\u2019s chances at getting the job full time.\n\nThe whole thing raises many questions \u2014 almost every aspect of it, in fact \u2014 and Trump doesn\u2019t have good answers.", "\n\nD.C. United midfielder Chris Durkin controls the ball against Toronto FC midfielder Michael Bradley. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post) (John Mcdonnell/AP)\n\nMultiple European clubs have again taken keen interest in D.C. United homegrown midfielder Chris Durkin, though the MLS organization seems unlikely to sell him this winter after resisting offers in the past year, the Insider has learned.\n\nDurkin, 18, enjoyed a breakout campaign this year, starting 16 regular season matches, appearing in 23 of 34 overall and performing with increasing maturity in his first full year with the first team.\n\nThe names of the clubs were not revealed, but Germany\u2019s Hannover and Portugal\u2019s Benfica have been linked to him in the past.\n\nHannover had declined United\u2019s asking price of between $1.5 million and $2 million; the Bundesliga side would have placed him with its under-23 squad and exposed him to first-team training sessions. Benfica\u2019s offer, estimated between $600,000 and $1 million, was rejected by the D.C. organization last winter; Durkin would have joined Benfica\u2019s second team.\n\nOffers from unspecified clubs have increased this fall, one person familiar with the situation said, but United seems to believe Durkin\u2019s value will rise in 2019.\n\n[Chris Durkin making gains in his first full MLS season]\n\nAside from his role with United, Durkin is a candidate for the U.S. squad likely headed for the Under-20 World Cup in Poland in May and June.\n\nAfter injuries to experienced D.C. teammates, Durkin started 12 matches between late March and late July. He performed well overall but was burdened at times by being the only player supporting two attacking central midfielders.\n\nUnited began to click when Coach Ben Olsen installed two defensive midfielders in a lineup rejuvenated by English star Wayne Rooney. Russell Canouse and Junior Moreno were the primary starters, but when Moreno was unavailable, Durkin started four of the final nine regular season matches.\n\nUnited was unbeaten in 10 games before falling to Columbus on penalty kicks in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nCanouse, 23, and Moreno, 25, will undoubtedly enter 2019 as the starting tandem. United could move Durkin to central defense, a position he has filled at times for the junior national teams and in United\u2019s preseason. Having grown in height and strength, he probably could meet the demands of the job.\n\nSteve Birnbaum, 27, played every minute this season, partnering with Frederic Brillant, 33, or Kofi Opare, 28. Opare had foot surgery two weeks ago and will be sidelined four to five months.\n\nDurkin, who is from the Richmond area, signed with United at 16 and, until this season, spent much of his time on loan with the second-flight Richmond Kickers and the U.S. under-17 national team.\n\nAlso, United is preparing to open negotiations with Argentine midfielder Luciano Acosta, whose dynamic performance in the second half of the season helped lift a last-place team into the playoffs. Acosta has one year remaining on a contract with a $550,000 base salary, fourth highest on the roster. A long-term extension probably would take that figure to about $1 million and protect United from losing him on a free transfer abroad next winter.\n\nAnd Joseph Mora, United\u2019s starting left back, received his first call-up to the Costa Rican national team, which will play friendlies at Chile on Nov. 16 and Peru on Nov. 20.

(Jeff Chiu/AP)\n\nManal al-Sharif, a Saudi women\u2019s rights activist, is the author of \u201cDaring to Drive: A Saudi Woman\u2019s Awakening.\u201d\n\nIn May 2011, the secret police took me from my home in Saudi Arabia in the middle of the night, while my 5-year-old son was sleeping. I might have disappeared without a trace \u2014 if it wasn\u2019t for one brave witness, Omar Aljohani, who took the risk of live-tweeting the details of the incident.\n\nTwitter, the platform that once saved my life, is now putting it in danger. The events in the weeks following Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul showed that the lives of other journalists and activists are also at risk. Seven years after Twitter saved me, I recently made the choice to delete my Twitter account live on stage in front of an audience of 1,000 people. I had more than 295,000 followers, and I am disconnecting from them for good.\n\nI lived under Saudi Arabia\u2019s totalitarian absolute monarchy, where the state controlled the air we breathe. Social media platforms created unprecedented opportunity for us to vent. And while the state tried its utmost to censor every new technology, including the Internet, it couldn\u2019t do the same with social media platforms. Such platforms were out of their control, at least for a few years. One of my friends tweeted to me back in 2011 when Twitter became the symbol for freedom in Saudi Arabia: \u201cI feel embarrassed that it took me watching mom joining twitter and follow your campaign before I [joined] too.\u201d People joined these platforms to engage in causes they believed in. The Arab Social Media report has shown year after year how Saudi Arabia is the No. 1 Arab nation in the number of active Twitter users and daily tweets.\n\nOnce totalitarian governments realized the power of these tools, they opted to use them. Repressive governments use these platforms as weapons of mass surveillance, manipulate the dialogue and push their own version of the story. Researchers have shown how the government of Saudi Arabia effectively shaped and molded the Twitter discourse by buying trolls and bots, while directly or indirectly threatening, harassing or arresting and jailing those who were influencers and didn\u2019t speak favorably of the government policies.\n\nTwitter has became full of harassment, death threats, intimidation and false news for us who have chosen to speak out in the Arab world. Twitter has not enacted any real change in making Twitter safer for us, which has pushed so many I know to quit the platform. Still, I continued to voice my views there. I believed that those governments should be the ones to be afraid, not us. I believed that I finally had a voice, and that I should use it.\n\nBut things changed dramatically last year, when the Saudi government launched a crackdown on Twitter influencers in the kingdom. Saud al-Qahtani, the head of the Saudi Union for Cyber Security and Programming and a former adviser to the Saudi crown prince, is believed to be behind the Saudi cyber army, or as we human rights activists like to call them, \u201cthe Electronic Flies.\u201d He launched a \u201cBlack List\u201d hashtag last year after the Saudi embargo on Qatar, urging Twitter users to point out any account that sympathized with Qatar.\n\nA number of prominent Twitter voices were pressured to take down their accounts or stop tweeting. We found out later that some had been arrested and thrown in jail under the guise of counter-terrorism. One of these Twitter personalities was Essam Al-Zamel, an entrepreneur and economist who criticized Aramco\u2019s initial public offering and has now been charged with terrorism.\n\nSome of those who have escaped the arrests were either contacted by phone or summoned and forced to sign pledges promising not to tweet. That same month, I received two phone calls on my Australian number from a member of the National Security, who was demanding the same from me. I refused to remain silent and continued tweeting about Saudi issues. During the same period, activists began to learn that the National Security was building cases against more Twitter users. Many of them started deleting the archives of their tweets. But the danger does not stop for us there because, even after tweets are deleted, Twitter\u2019s website does not mention whether those same tweets are deleted from the archives, or whether the deleted tweets are still accessible to developers.\n\nAnd while some anonymous Twitter accounts initially went on challenging the authorities, they suddenly went quiet in March this year. According to the New York Times, the Saudi intelligence services had infiltrated them through an insider in Twitter named Ali Alzabarah (A spokesman for Twitter declined to comment to the Times). Turki Aljasser, a columnist who was believed to be the owner of one such account, was arrested on March 15. I have been contacted in person by anonymous individuals who confirmed the disappearance of the man behind @Sama7ti, another account that refused to back down despite pressure from authorities. (I also know the man\u2019s full identity.)\n\nWhen I followed Twitter trends in Saudi Arabia and worldwide in the weeks after Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance, things became clear. In the first week, while the rest of the world was using the #JamalKhashoggi hashtag, the trending hashtags in Saudi Arabia were #Kidnapping_Ant_and_Cockroach and #Aljamal_Jamal_Alrouh, which translates to \u201cBeauty consists in the beauty of the soul.\u201d There were so many tweets with these hashtags that they effectively drowned out any hashtag with the word Jamal, which translates to \u201cbeauty\u201d in English. For two weeks, while the rest of the world was entering a frenzy about Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance and possible murder, it felt as though the Saudis were living in a bubble. When Saudi officials finally cracked under pressure and acknowledged the murder in late October, the third-most trending hashtag worldwide was the Arabic phrase, \u201cI am Arab and Mohammed bin Salman represents me.\u201d That day, it became evident to me that we had lost these social media platforms to the dictators.\n\nTwitter, which was once a tool to change the discourse, give voice to the voiceless and push for social justice, is now becoming a trap \u2014 one that is used by our regimes to haunt and silence us. It is being used to propagate misinformation and spread regime propaganda on a greater scale than ever before. And although Twitter finally suspended 70 million fake and malicious accounts in May snf June of this year, this action is still not enough.\n\nI am pleading tech makers to build decentralized social media platforms that don\u2019t store and sell our information, platforms that are built on the concept of fair use, and to reward authentic and organic content, instead of rewarding bots and fake accounts. They should not allow the powerful and wealthy to manipulate and dominate the conversation. Because freedom of speech safeguards all other freedoms, and it\u2019s our responsibility to protect it.\n\nRead more:\n\nJamal Khashoggi: What the Arab world needs most is freedom of expression\n\nManal al-Sharif: Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance spreads fear, but we won\u2019t be silenced", "BERLIN \u2014 Police in the German city of Hamburg say they have seized over a ton of cocaine and arrested eight suspects following an investigation that lasted several months.\n\nOn Thursday, officers followed a truck they suspected was being used to transport drugs to a Hamburg haulage company.

Counting all the votes makes all the difference in the world.\n\nIn the House, as of this writing, the Democratic gains are up to 30 with about five more races still to be called \u2014 in which Democrats are leading. A gain of 35 seats would be the largest House pickup for Democrats since the first post-Watergate midterm election in 1974.\n\nThe Democrats picked up seven governorships, with Stacey Abrams, as of now, still fighting to make it to a runoff in Georgia, and Andrew Gillum trailing by 0.4 percentage points, enough to trigger a recount in Florida.\n\nIn the Senate, Democrats may not quite have pulled off an inside straight, but they had two aces \u2014 in Nevada and Arizona. With 26 seats to defend, many in red states, it now looks as if their losses will be small. Democrats won in Nevada and are now poised to pick up a seat in Arizona. In the latter, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema surged into the lead as additional Maricopa County ballots were counted.)\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats have an outside chance to hold on to Florida. There, Republican Gov. Rick Scott leads by only 0.2 percentage points over Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. If Sinema and Nelson win, Republicans, in a year with the most favorable map in recent history, would pick up only a net of one seat (52 to 48); if Sinema wins but Nelson doesn\u2019t, Republicans would only eke out a net gain of two seats (53 to 47). That\u2019s simply remarkable considering they had to defend incumbents in the following in states President Trump won, in some cases by double digits: Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, Montana, Florida, Michigan, Missouri, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and North Dakota. As conservative Quin Hillyer put it, one would reasonably expect \u201cRepublicans on this map, in this economy . . . [to gain] at least five seats, with six or seven more likely than three or four.\u201d\n\nSimply because Trump did not see all these losses on Election Night does not make them any less real or consequential for Republicans. Put differently, outside the deepest-red enclaves Republicans took a beating up and down the ballot.\n\nRemember, states also passed ballot initiatives to raise the minimum wage, to expand voting access and to legalize marijuana; you have to wonder whether Trump and his ilk realize they are in retreat politically and policy-wise.\n\nIf you then turn to exit polls, voters said by big margins: they disapprove of Trump (54 percent to 45 percent ); regard the GOP unfavorably (52 percent to 44 percent); think the country is on the wrong track (54 percent to 42 percent), thought Trump\u2019s immigration policies were too harsh (46 percent, with 33 percent saying they were about right and 17 saying not tough enough); favor tougher gun laws (59 percent to 37 percent); think his foreign policy makes the country less safe (46 percent to 38 percent); disapprove of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh (47 percent to 44 percent); want to uphold Roe v. Wade (66 percent to 25 percent); think it is somewhat or very important to elect more minorities (72 percent to 24 percent) and somewhat or very important to elect more women (78 percent to 20 percent); think sexual harassment is a big problem (84 percent to 14 percent); and are more concerned about people being denied the right to vote than voter fraud (53 percent to 36 percent).\n\nIt drives Trump\u2019s critics to distraction to watch him dominate every news cycle and repeat lies that have long since been debunked. They should be upset ; the president\u2019s lies, racism, meanness and ignorance debase the presidency. However, Trump\u2019s not helping himself or his party.

The only alternative on the table, he said, is a no-deal Brexit that would \u201cinflict untold damage\u201d on Britain.\n\n\u201cIt has become increasingly clear to me that the withdrawal agreement, which is being finalized in Brussels and Whitehall even as I write, will be a terrible mistake,\u201d said Jo Johnson, who was a transport minister in the government.\n\nTo give the public a choice between these two disastrous versions of Brexit would be a \u201cfailure of British statecraft on a scale unseen since the Suez crisis,\u201d he said, referencing the 1956 conflict against Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser that is widely seen as marking the moment at which Britain formally lost its imperial role in the world.\n\nInstead, Johnson said it would be proper to give the British public a chance to vote again because of the way the Brexit negotiations have evolved.\n\n\u201cGiven that the reality of Brexit has turned out to be so far from what was once promised, the democratic thing to do is to give the public the final say,\u201d Jo Johnson said.\n\nHis older brother Boris resigned in July to protest May\u2019s Brexit plan \u2014 but Boris did so as a staunch support of a hard-line Brexit, while Jo Johnson backed the \u201cremain\u201d side during the June, 2016 referendum.\n\nIn a tweet, Boris Johnson said he had \u201cboundless admiration\u201d for his brother and that they are \u201cunited in dismay\u201d at the indefensibility of May\u2019s position even though they disagree over Brexit.\n\nJo Johnson\u2019s resignation, and his call for a fresh referendum to test voter sentiment, further complicates matters for May as she tries to strike a deal with EU leaders that would pass muster with her own cabinet and win backing in Parliament.\n\nShe has consistently rejected the idea of another nationwide vote on Brexit, insisting her obligation is to make good on the will of the people as expressed in 2016.\n\nHer Conservative Party remains deeply divided on her approach, and it is not clear if she will win wide backing from opposition Labour Party lawmakers when any proposed deal is put to Parliament.\n\nMay is also facing more opposition from the Democratic Unionist Party, a party in Northern Ireland whose lawmakers have propped up May\u2019s minority government.

And on Friday, the Austrian government announced that Kneissl had canceled a trip to Russia planned for next month and summoned the Russian charge d\u2019affaires.\n\nAustrian authorities claim to have uncovered that a retired army colonel had been spying for Russia for several decades, beginning in the 1990s and continuing all the way up to this year. The Krone newspaper reported that the unnamed colonel had been paid the equivalent of $340,000 for confidential details about Austria\u2019s air force and artillery systems. He could face up to two years in prison if found guilty.\n\nChancellor Sebastian Kurz said at a news conference Friday that if the allegations were confirmed, it would not improve the already strained relationship between Russia and the European Union. \u201cEspionage is unacceptable,\u201d he said, according to the Austria Press Agency.\n\nKneissl also offered a warning that if the Austrian government\u2019s suspicions were proved correct, it would place \u201ca serious burden on the bilateral relations between Austria and Russia.\"\n\nRussia has denied any knowledge of the spy scandal and summoned the Austrian ambassador to demand an explanation. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters that Austria was breaking the norms of international communications and conducting \u201cmegaphone diplomacy\u201d by going public with the accusations so quickly.\n\n\u201cThey accuse us in public and then demand public explanations over an issue we know nothing about,\u201d Lavrov said, according to the Russian news agency.\n\nThe scandal could mark a turning point in relations between Russia and the new Austrian government. Vienna had previously sought neutrality in foreign affairs, trying to maintain ties to both Russia and its allies in the European Union. But when a coalition of the center-right People\u2019s Party and the far-right Freedom Party gained control of the government last year, the country took a number of positions that appeared designed to draw it closer to Moscow.\n\nIn the aftermath of the poisoning of double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, England, this year, many Western nations expelled Russian diplomats.

Finland was ultimately chosen instead.\n\nAustrian Defense Minister Mario Kunasek said Friday that the alleged spying had come to light only a few weeks ago, following a tip from a friendly intelligence service.

Whitaker acting attorney general to curtail the special counsel investigation, telling reporters that he hasn\u2019t spoken to him about the probe.\n\nTrump took it a step further, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know Matt Whitaker.\u201d That claim was at odds with an interview a month ago on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d in which Trump said: \u201cI can tell you Matt Whitaker\u2019s a great guy. I mean, I know Matt Whitaker.\u201d\n\nTrump spoke to reporters Friday as he left the White House en route to Paris. His comments came two days after Trump ousted Jeff Sessions as attorney general and installed Whitaker, Sessions\u2019s chief of staff and a former U.S. attorney in Iowa, as the top official at the Justice Department.\n\nThe Washington Post reported this week that one of the reasons Trump liked Whitaker was because Whitaker had briefed him on many occasions. He did so because the president preferred not to talk to Sessions, whom he had often disparaged publicly.\n\n[Before he led the Justice Department, Matthew G. Whitaker promoted company accused of deceiving clients]\n\nTrump\u2019s assessment of Whitaker on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d last month came in response to a Post report that Trump had spoken to Whitaker about replacing Sessions. While Trump did not confirm the report at the time, he used the opportunity to praise Whitaker.\n\nTrump has sought to distance himself from close associates once they fall out of favor or become embroiled in controversy. Trump, for example, sought to minimize the role played by his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort after he faced tax- and bank-fraud charges. Trump also sought to minimize the legal work done for him by his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen as he faced federal charges.\n\nSince stepping into his new role, Whitaker has faced questions \u2014 principally from Democrats \u2014 about whether he should recuse himself from overseeing the investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III into Russian interference into the 2016 election, given that Whitaker had criticized the probe in opinion pieces and as a television commentator.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s appointment has also prompted questions from Democrats about whether Trump brought him aboard to curtail or shut down the Mueller investigation, which is examining possible coordination between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia and potential obstruction of the probe by Trump.\n\nAsked by a reporter whether he hired Whitaker to rein in the probe, Trump said: \u201cWhat a stupid question.\u201d\n\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment Friday on the president\u2019s remarks about Whitaker.\n\nWhile claiming not to know Whitaker, Trump praised him Friday as a \u201cvery strong person with a very strong personality,\u201d saying that\u2019s what the Justice Department needs at this point.\n\n\u201cMatthew Whitaker is a very smart man,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe is a very respected man in the law enforcement community . . . The choice was greeted with raves initially.\u201d\n\nIn recent days, Whitaker has faced a great deal of scrutiny in the media, including for his service on the advisory board of an invention-promotion company accused of fraud by customers.\n\nTrump also sought Friday to dismiss the notion that Whitaker should recuse himself of oversight of the Russia probe. Trump suggested he would have few choices for attorney general and other top government posts if he eliminated everyone who had been on television.\n\n\u201cDo we have to hire somebody in a shell? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAs a television commentator before taking the job with Sessions, Whitaker floated the idea of defunding the Mueller probe. He said it would cross a \u201cred line\u201d for Mueller to investigate the finances of the Trump Organization. And he said that it was \u201cridiculous\u201d for Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein to have appointed Mueller, as opposed to running the Russia investigation through regular Justice Department channels.\n\nThe Post reported Thursday that Whitaker has no intention of recusing himself from overseeing the special-counsel probe, according to people close to him.\n\nTrump also sought to brush off suggestions by some lawyers \u2014 including George Conway, husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway \u2014 that the Constitution requires Whitaker to be confirmed by the Senate before he starts serving.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E.

(Marcus Ingram/Getty Images for HBO)\n\nThe business dispute that yanked HBO off the air for millions of Americans on Nov. 1 is entering its second week \u2014 with no signs of a respite.\n\nAs many as 2.5 million customers have lost access to hit HBO shows such as \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cWestworld\u201d through Dish Network, America\u2019s second-largest satellite TV provider.\n\nThe blackout affects an additional 10.2 million Dish subscribers who aren\u2019t signed up for HBO but who could be potential customers of the premium entertainment channel.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time HBO has ever \u201cgone dark,\u201d in the parlance of TV execs. Viewers are being caught in the middle, with potential consequences on both sides: An extended outage could lead to significant customer losses.\n\nThe standoff between Dish and HBO stems from a seemingly run-of-the-mill contract negotiation over whether Dish should pay HBO for a guaranteed number of customers, whether those subscribers materialize or not.\n\nBut it also takes place against the backdrop of a historic Justice Department effort to scrutinize the increasingly concentrated media industry and to unwind the merger that gave control of HBO to one of the nation\u2019s biggest telecom companies: AT&T.\n\n[6 ways the AT&T merger could affect you]\n\nThe impasse carries enormous stakes that reflect the dire condition of the legacy television business. What began as a trickle of consumers toward digital TV alternatives, such as Netflix and Hulu, has turned into a torrent, with analysts such as eMarketer predicting that 33 million Americans will have given up their pay-TV subscriptions by the end of the year. With both Dish and AT&T reporting even-steeper-than-expected declines in their traditional TV subscriber base in recent months, the pressure to retain customers is intense, analysts say.\n\n\u201cThe rate of decline in the core satellite TV segment has sharply accelerated,\u201d Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, wrote in a research note this week. \u201cThey have argued that retaining their best customers is now their priority.\u201d\n\nChannel blackouts are commonly regarded as a game of chicken in the TV industry, with participants on each side hoping the other will blink first. Dish\u2019s chairman, Charlie Ergen, is widely known as a combative opponent in negotiations who has frequently allowed channels to go dark rather than agree to deals he doesn\u2019t like. Dish has previously gone dark with Univision, Sinclair, Fox, Viacom and AMC, according to Moffett. Ergen has said in the past that \u201creal\u201d negotiations do not begin until a blackout occurs.\n\nIn a sign of how acrimonious the feud has become, Dish has accused AT&T of weaponizing HBO in a bid to lure its customers away to AT&T\u2019s DirecTV, its chief rival. AT&T denies any interference in HBO\u2019s contract negotiations. And it alleges Dish has secretly \u201ccollaborated\u201d with the Justice Department to tarnish the telecom giant\u2019s name, in the wake of the government\u2019s failed attempt to block AT&T\u2019s purchase of Time Warner, now renamed WarnerMedia.\n\n\u201cThis is purely an anticompetitive play that we tried to warn about,\u201d Ergen said during an investor conference call Wednesday. \u201cAT&T knows full well that for many of our customers the only place they can go is to DirecTV, and they own HBO and they own DIRECTV,\u201d Ergen added. \u201cSo they\u2019re willing to make that trade-off.\u201d\n\nAlthough some Dish customers may be able to sign up for HBO\u2019s stand-alone digital app, HBO Now, many live in rural areas without high-speed Internet access, effectively taking that option off the table, Ergen said.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment on AT&T\u2019s accusations of collaboration. But a person familiar with the agency\u2019s thinking called the idea \u201cuntrue\u201d and \u201claughable,\u201d speaking on the condition of anonymity in light of the government\u2019s pending appeal in the case that allowed AT&T to purchase Time Warner.\n\n[The ravages of cord-cutting: AT&T's race against time to save its TV business]\n\nKeith Cocozza, a spokesman for WarnerMedia, HBO\u2019s parent, said Dish bears the blame for causing the blackout by refusing to deal.\n\n\u201cHBO offered to extend talks while they negotiated towards an agreement. Dish walked away,\u201d Cocozza said. \u201cHBO continues to deliver its signal to Dish and [is] willing to negotiate.\u201d", "\n\nFalcons right tackle Ryan Schraeder draws several of the league's top pass rushers -- like Redskins outside linebacker Ryan Kerrigan (91) -- as assignments. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nFrom a prestige standpoint, Ryan Schraeder plays the wrong position. He lines up on the side the quarterback can see when he drops back, the side that does not make eight-figure annual salaries, the side that does not get now-a-major-motion-picture books written about it.\n\nThere is no catchy name to Schraeder\u2019s space on the field \u2014 The Visible Side doesn\u2019t exactly have a ring to it, does it?\n\nJake Matthews, the Atlanta Falcons\u2019 left tackle, was once picked sixth overall and earns $14.5 million per season. Schraeder, Matthews\u2019s teammate, went undrafted out of college and makes $6.3 million. He plays right tackle, the NFL\u2019s most thankless position.\n\nOn the majority of his Sundays, Schraeder stares across the line of scrimmage at one of the best pass rushers in the NFL. Left tackles get all the love. Schraeder and his brethren, more and more, draw the tougher assignment.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know when they started doing that, but they\u2019ve kind of made the switch,\u201d Schraeder said. \u201cTeams are getting smart, and they realize probably the best pass protector is on the left side. They\u2019re putting their best defensive end coming off my side. In today\u2019s NFL, it\u2019s pretty important to have a good pass blocking right tackle.\u201d\n\n[In the NFL, the gap between haves and have-nots is growing]\n\nThe evolution of the NFL can be tracked through the perceived importance of the offensive tackle position. As pass-heavy West Coast offenses conquered football, teams placed their best pass rusher over the left tackle, aligning him to rush the quarterback\u2019s blind side, which was most likely to result in sacks and, truth be told, injurious hits to the quarterback. In response to seeing their franchise pillars under siege, offensive coaches began placing their best linemen at left tackle. The position gained importance until the best linemen were selected to play left tackle at early ages, front offices made left tackles the second highest-paid players in football, and Sandra Bullock won an Oscar.\n\nFor years, elite pass rushers and left tackles existed in brutal harmony. The contours of the sport have shifted enough to shake that balance, and that shift has caused ripple effects of its own.\n\nThe blind side is no longer the domain of the NFL\u2019s most lethal pass rushers. This season, according to data accumulated by Pro Football Focus, Demarcus Lawrence, Cameron Jordan and J.J. Watt have lined up on the right side of the offensive line on more than 92 percent of their rushes. Former Super Bowl MVP Von Miller has rushed from the right 79 percent of the time, which is down from last season. Khalil Mack, the highest-paid defender in NFL history, has rushed from the quarterback\u2019s front side 73 percent of the time.\n\n\n\nSuperstar pass rushers J.J. Watt of the Texans and Von Miller of the Broncos do the vast majority of their damage against opposing right tackles. (Photo by Justin Edmonds/Getty Images)\n\nThe trend started a handful of years ago and has since magnified. The primary reason teams now line up their best pass rushers opposite the blind side is simple: It\u2019s the next logical step in the evolution. If offenses are putting their best lineman on the left, they want to attack the lesser tackle on the right.\n\n\u201cPeople that aren\u2019t as stringent with their defensive line and they\u2019re open-minded, they\u2019re going to try to get the best mismatch they can get,\u201d said Los Angeles Rams offensive line coach Aaron Kromer. \u201cA lot of times that\u2019s the right tackle over the left tackle. You\u2019d hate to have a tie with your best pass rusher if the left tackle is really, really good. I think it\u2019s smart by defensive coaches to move them around, try to get a good matchup.\u201d\n\nThe changing positioning of top pass rushers is also a response to modern offense, which relies on short pass attempts unlikely to result in sacks. This season, quarterbacks have completed 64.8 percent of their passes, surpassing the previous all-time high, set in 2015, by a full 1.8 percent. Meanwhile, only three quarterbacks \u2014 frequent scramblers Deshaun Watson, Dak Prescott and Josh Allen \u2014 have spent more than three seconds in the pocket on an average dropback, per Pro Football Focus.\n\n[At the NFL's midpoint, there are these four teams and then there's everybody else]\n\nA quarterback seeing a pass rusher coming is not detrimental for a defense against a quick slant or a bubble screen. It\u2019s beneficial. If a pass rusher arrives at the quarterback\u2019s blind side just after he releases a quick pass, then he had no effect on the play. But that same rusher could make an impact if a quarterback sees him coming.\n\n\u201cDefensive coordinators, their idea a lot of the time is timing,\u201d Los Angeles Rams left tackle Andrew Whitworth said. \u201cThe fact that the [quarterback] is seeing you, and get him off his spot, where he can\u2019t work downfield to throw. Now, they kind of understand, this may affect him sooner, because the balls get out faster now.\u201d\n\nSacks are no longer the sole measure by which a pass rusher is judged \u2014 quarterback pressures, including hits and hurries, have proven to be critical in disrupting opposing passing games. Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes, this season\u2019s breakout star, has recorded a near-perfect passer rating of 140.3 when he hasn\u2019t faced pressure this season. Against pressure, according to Pro Football Focus, his rating plummets to 64.9.\n\n\u201cOur main job is to make the quarterback feel comfortable back there,\u201d said Lions right tackle Rick Wagner, the highest-paid pure right tackle in the NFL. \u201cIn the past, they wanted to rely on that guy protecting his blind side so he doesn\u2019t have to worry about those hits. Now, you can\u2019t have a guy in his face who\u2019s going to get in his line of sight make him feel flustered.\u201d\n\nEven a blind-side hit after the release of a pass carries lesser currency today than in years past. New rules discourage defenders from hitting quarterbacks in a way that could injure them. Knocking a quarterback out of the game was an unsaid, but very real, factor in defenses hunting blind-side hits. Rules have diminished that incentive.\n\n[The Steelers are on a roll without Le\u2019Veon Bell. But that doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t want him back.]\n\n\u201cIn the past, that\u2019s kind of what was known \u2014 you got your best pass protector at left tackle, and your road grader at right tackle,\u201d said Rams right tackle Rob Havenstein, whom Pro Football Focus rates as the NFL\u2019s second-best right tackle. \u201cI think nowadays, guys got to be able to do everything.\u201d\n\nThe defensive coordinators lining up the likes of Watt and Mack across the right side of the offensive line have done right tackles a favor: It has made them far more valuable. Left tackles are still the NFL\u2019s second-highest paid players at $5.9 million on average, behind only quarterbacks, according to Spotrac. Defensive ends are next at $3.2 million \u2014 followed by right tackles, at $3 million.\n\nDeryk Gilmore, the head of Day 1 Sports and Entertainment, represents Kansas City Chiefs right tackle Mitchell Schwartz. During negotiations with the Chiefs in 2016, Gilmore espoused the idea Schwartz should make $8 million per season.\n\n\u201cPeople looked at me like I was crazy,\u201d Gilmore said.\n\nSchwartz ended up signing a five-year contract worth nearly $7 million per year, bonuses included. For two years, Schwartz played in the same division as Mack, Miller and Joey Bosa, three of the NFL\u2019s best pass rushers, all of whom line up predominantly against the right side of the offense.\n\nSchwartz still developed a reputation as one of the best tackles in football. This season, Pro Football Focus rates Schwartz as the best pass-blocking right tackle in the NFL and grades him as the fifth-best right tackle overall.\n\n[Adam Thielen interviewed for a job selling dental equipment. He became an NFL star instead.]\n\nGilmore\u2019s notion that Schwartz was worth $8 million a year now only seems crazy because it would be too small an asking price. The Cowboys re-signed La\u2019el Collins, another Gilmore client, at $7.7 million per season. The Redskins gave Morgan Moses \u2014 whom Schraeder singled out as one of the NFL\u2019s best pass-blockers \u2014 an $8 million-per-season deal. The Lions signed Wagner to a five-year, $47.5 million free agent deal before the 2017 season. Given the performance of the Chiefs\u2019 offense and his place in it, Schwartz is an obvious candidate for a contract restructuring.\n\n\u201cThe fallacy of the right tackle not being important is crazy,\u201d Gilmore said. \u201cAnd now, what do teams do? They try to stack their offensive lines.\u201d\n\nA stark disparity remains. The NFL\u2019s 13 highest-paid tackles play on the left side. (Eagles right tackle Lane Johnson signed a five-year, $52 million contract in January 2016, but the sides negotiated the deal on the understanding Johnson would eventually replace Jason Peters at left tackle.) Even if right tackles draw tougher assignments than left tackles, they make less money.\n\n\u201cYou see those left tackle contracts, they start off pretty high,\u201d Schraeder said. \u201cThere is a huge difference in the pay. It\u2019s a little outdated, I would say, with all the pass rushers they\u2019re putting [against] the right side. I don\u2019t know how soon that\u2019s going to change.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the past, the left side has gotten the traditional premier guy,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cIt\u2019s evening out over the years.\u201d\n\nWhitworth, one of the best tackles in the league, made the case that the hierarchy isn\u2019t going to change. He believes left tackles, regardless of the talent level across from them, carry the heavier burden, one personnel changes across the ball cannot undo. \u201cIf you get beat as a left tackle or give up a little pressure,\u201d Whitworth said, \u201cit\u2019s a complete blind hit.\u201d\n\nSo, then, let it be known: If their less-heralded counterparts catch up to them, left tackles will not have seen it coming.\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nBill Belichick was either ripping Aaron Rodgers or coaching really well.

The unit has been launched amid allegations by human rights groups and the public that police killed 22 suspects in the last two weeks in a low-income area of Nairobi.\n\nRights groups have for years claimed that Kenya\u2019s police force is riddled with corruption and carries out abuses.\n\nEric Kiraithe, a former police spokesman who is now the government spokesman admitted that corruption in the force saying it \u201cruns deep and wide.\u201d\n\nThe local chapter of the international anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International has for more than a decade ranked the Kenyan police as the most corrupt institution in a country where corruption is endemic.\n\nThe abuses have continued despite an exercise in which all 100,000 officers are being scrutinized, rights advocates say. Some 2,000 officers have been fired out of around 50,000 scrutinized as the exercise which started in December 2013 and is continuing.\n\nWhen that investigation began, body parts from a person reported kidnapped were sent to the National Police Service Commission with a note warning the chairman to tread carefully.\n\nThe Independent Medico-Legal Unit, or IMLU, has conducted autopsies on the bodies of the 22 killed by police. \u201cOur preliminary investigations indicate that those were extrajudicial killings,\u201d said Peter Kiama, the executive director of the group. \u201cThey were not done according to the law. The police were in a position to arrest and not kill those individuals.\u201d\n\nThe IMLU in 2014 documented how a majority of police killings at that time were connected to police extorting money from suspects and not police work. He said human rights defenders who raised concern about the killings are being threatened.\n\nKiama said the internal affairs unit can be effective if given independence and resources.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge investment and the demonstration of political will is a plus,\u201d he said, adding that despite the challenges facing the new unit, \u201cthere is justification for skepticism but there is space for optimism.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Peter Dasilva/EPA-EFE)\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nIn mere hours last Thursday, the Camp Fire - California\u2019s most destructive on record - transformed Paradise into hell. At least 29 people died in the blaze and over 200 are missing. Still only 25 percent contained, the inferno has now consumed an estimated 111,000 acres and burned through nearly 7,000 structures.\n\n[As Camp Fire death toll climbs, investigators face grim task of finding remains]\n\nA second blaze, dubbed the Woosley Fire, in Southern California, has surged to over 85,500 acres since its inception late Thursday, and destroyed 177 structures.\n\nHow did these wildfires grow so explosively? It began with scant rainfall and abnormally warm temperatures which parched the landscape and created tinderbox conditions. Then came howling winds that fanned the flames, once the fires were sparked. And, in an environment of rising temperatures, climate change increased their potential intensity.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s fire season typically begins in late spring, around the end of May into early June. It lasts until wintertime rains arrive in November or December, when \u201catmospheric rivers\u201d carry tropical moisture into the otherwise arid region.\n\nBut this fall, hot and dry weather has persisted longer, and the rains have yet to come \u2014 fitting into a trend toward longer fire seasons. Increasingly, fire season isn\u2019t constrained to the warm months, but occurring year-round.\n\nClimate change has \u201cshortened the rainy season at both ends\" said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Los Angeles, in an email.\n\nParadise has received just 0.88 inches of rain since May 1, compared with a historical average of over 7 inches during the same period.\n\n\u201cIf Northern California had received anywhere near the typical amount of autumn precipitation this year ... explosive fire behavior & stunning tragedy in #Paradise would almost certainly not have occurred,\u201d Swain wrote in a tweet.\n\nObjective indicators of vegetation dryness and potential fire intensity were at record-high levels for the date this week in vicinity of #CampFire--and would have been very high even for peak summer levels--at a time of year when the rainy season is usually ramping up.

Spinning clockwise, this system pushes wind down the chain of mountains westward toward the coast.\n\n\n\nLandsat 8 imagery composite showing the location of the Camp Fire near Paradise, Calif.\n\nWhen air moves downhill, it is compressed because of the greater weight of the atmosphere \u2014 and subsequently warms. But this \u201cdownslope\u201d warming dries out the air, and the relative humidity percentages can tank into single digits.\n\nIt\u2019s this process that ushers a bone-dry airmass into the heavily populated spine of the Golden State. On Thursday, the National Weather Service office serving the San Francisco Bay Area measured record low levels of atmospheric moisture for the time of year.\n\nThis dry downsloping is often accompanied by 60-mph winds. When the Santa Ana winds arrive, any seemingly innocuous flame can quickly become deadly.\n\nThe warming climate only makes a hot, dry weather pattern \u2014 prone to fire-fanning winds \u2014 more extreme. It intensifies a process known as evapotranspiration in which plants release water into the air. The warmer the air, the more water plants release.\n\nThis year, like 2017, California has had an unusually hot & dry fire season.

It\u2019s a vicious cycle.\n\nLast year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that a record 129 million trees \u2014 \u201cmostly conifers\u201d \u2014 died as a result of drought. The agency cited an \u201cincreased wildfire threat\u201d for 2018 in its December 2017 report, adding that 56 percent of its national budget was consumed by firefighting efforts.\n\nGoing into the 2018 fire season, experts already knew it would be bad. The 129 million dead trees covered a historic 8.9 million acres, the department said.\n\nBut the last piece of the puzzle? Where we build. Irrespective of climate change, wildfires will inevitably claim more structures if we continue to build and expand their targets.\n\nExperts refer to the wildlife-urban interface \u2014 WUI \u2014 the approximately half-mile radius at the periphery of communities where the forests and humans \u201cmeet.\u201d According to a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in March, there has been a 41 percent increase in the number of homes built in the WUI between 1990 and 2010 \u2014 totaling 43.4 million homes.\n\nThis, the authors explain, could be a grave problem. \u201cWildfire problems will not abate if recent housing growth trends continue.\u201d\n\nSwain said the intrusion of wildfires into populated urban areas \u201cused to be really rare historically, but has been happening with alarming frequency recently.\u201d Combined with the effects of climate change, that factor is leading the trend toward larger and more destructive fires in California, he said.", "THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. -- Another mass shooting in America has left another region stricken with grief, sorrow and questions about what could have possibly motivated someone to gun down a dozen people at a country-western bar.\n\nThe massacre that left 12 people dead -- including an 18-year-old who had just started college, a Marine and a sergeant who rushed in to confront the shooter -- also left behind uncertainty regarding how a gunman neighbors knew as troubled and who prompted a mental-health check from police was able to legally obtain the handgun used in the attack. Even as the community reckoned with the violence, it also quickly turned to another threat, as roaring wildfires prompted extensive evacuations in the area and elsewhere in the state.\n\nThe shooting in Thousand Oaks, a city of about 130,000 near Los Angeles, followed on a seemingly endless series of rampages in churches, movie theaters, schools, community centers and offices. Police said Ian David Long, a 28-year-old from the area and a former Marine, first shot a security guard outside with a .45-caliber handgun, then marched inside, shooting staff and then patrons of the Borderline Bar & Grill who had gathered for its college night.\n\n[The 12 lives lost in the California bar shooting]\n\nWhen Sgt. Ron Helus of the Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Office headed inside to confront him, the veteran officer was shot multiple times and mortally wounded.

He said investigators contacted Instagram -- which is owned by Facebook -- and that the company took the page down from public view but saved it for authorities to review. A Facebook spokesperson said Friday that the company had \u201cremoved the shooter\u2019s accounts from Facebook and Instagram and will remove any praise or support for the crime or the shooter as soon as we\u2019re aware.\u201d\n\nBuschow said the investigation would look at \u201cevery social media\u201d avenue possible to try to determine more about a motive and the shooter\u2019s mindset. Mass shootings are often followed by a painful search for answers about what could have motivated the bloodshed. In some cases, answers remain out of reach; more than a year after a gunman in Las Vegas killed 58 people, his motive remains an unnerving mystery.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any details about motive at this point,\u201d Buschow said in an interview Friday afternoon. \u201cI know that\u2019s one of the big frustration with Vegas -- there\u2019s no answer to the why. Hopefully we will be able to determine whatever the motive was.\u201d\n\nPeople who escaped the rampage -- among them some who had also survived the massacre of 58 people at a country-music festival in Las Vegas a year earlier -- described the gunman as methodical and silent.\n\n\u201cIt was a very stern, straight-faced, focused face,\u201d said David Anderson, 23, of Newbury Park, who lived through both the Las Vegas shooting and the Thousand Oaks attack. \u201cDidn\u2019t say anything.\u201d\n\nPeople who had encountered Long in the past described him as angry and troubled. Attempts to reach Long\u2019s mother and other relatives have been unsuccessful. Neighbors of the home where Long lived with his mother, Colleen Long, recounted a pattern of unnerving behavior that left some unsurprised to hear he was named as the shooter.\n\nCarol Richardson, who lived nearby, said a friend went to the home multiple times to \u201ccalm him down,\u201d and her 19-year-old daughter, Morgan, said: \u201cWe always knew he had problems.\u201d\n\nWhat followed the rampage at the Borderline has become a grimly familiar ritual across the country. Reports of the gunfire give way to accounts of multiple people struck or killed. Then tales of chaos, horror and heroism emerge from those who escaped. And, as occurred after attacks from Parkland, Fla., to Sutherland Springs, Tex., questions began to emerge about the red flags before the bloodshed and what, if anything, law enforcement officials could or should have done.\n\n[Thousand Oaks gunman had \u2018several contacts\u2019 with police over the years]\n\nTodd Stratton, who was friends with Long in high school, said he was in the Borderline listening to country music when he saw his friend walk in with a gun.\n\n\"I can\u2019t believe he killed my friends and he was my friend too,\u201d an emotional Stratton said.\n\nStratton said it was a \u201creal mystery\u201d why Long targeted the club, but described him long having been angry and aggressive.\n\n\u201cHe had troubles long before the military,\u201d Stratton said. \u201cHe was a hot head. He would drink and get into fights but nothing that weird.\u201d\n\nIn at least one instance, Long\u2019s issues came to the attention of law enforcement. Dean said police had encountered Long in April when they were called out for a disturbance.\n\nLong was acting irrationally, so they brought out a crisis-intervention team to meet with him, Dean said. They discussed the possibility that \u201che might be suffering from PTSD,\u201d Dean said, noting Long\u2019s service in the Marines. (Long deployed to Afghanistan between 2010 and 2011 and left the Marines as a corporal in March 2013.)\n\nThat team \u201cmet with him, talked to him and cleared him\u201d and did not feel they could take him into custody under a so-called 5150 order, Dean told reporters. Under a 5150 order, a person who is deemed to be \u201ca danger to others, or to himself or herself\" can be taken into custody for up to 72 hours -- which would have barred him from owning or possessing firearms.\n\nPolice have not released more information regarding the April encounter and how Long was cleared, but neighbors recalled hearing alarming banging noises and yelling from within the house in the middle of the night. That gave way to a standoff with police, as officers aimed their guns and rifles at the home during the situation, one neighbor recalled. Ultimately, Long was cleared, and Dean said it appeared the Glock handgun used in the attack was purchased legally.\n\nThat also echoes findings from previous shooting rampages. An FBI study of active shootings between 2000 and 2013 found that most of the attackers, usually men or boys, wielded legally obtained guns. The study also said that shooters had concerned people around them prior to the attacks, and it noted that law enforcement officials were only able to verify that 25 percent of these attackers had diagnosed mental health issues.\n\nIn Thousand Oaks and beyond, the shooting prompted vigils and renewed calls for new gun control measures. Schools were closed and a center in the city set aside for mourning families to gather.\n\n[The Las Vegas shooting survivors who went on to survive this latest massacre]\n\nDean, the sheriff, had planned to attend his own retirement party on Saturday, capping off eight years as the county\u2019s sheriff and 41 years in the department. He had just gotten home Wednesday night from someone else\u2019s retirement party when he got a text message about the bar shooting. He put his uniform back on and headed to the Borderline for what wound up being a sleepless night.\n\nOn Thursday, he went to tell the families of people killed in the Borderline that their loved ones were among those slain. His last day in the job would be spent responding to the massacre, while his retirement party planned for Saturday has been called off.\n\n\u201cThat won\u2019t be happening,\u201d Dean said while standing on the street near the Borderline on Thursday afternoon. \u201cI\u2019ll be here tomorrow, and I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ll be Saturday.\u201d\n\nBerman reported from Washington.

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.", "Opinion writer\n\nIn the run-up to Election Day in 2016, Donald Trump repeatedly and flatly declared that the outcome of the election would be legitimate only if he won. The claim, stripped down to its essence, was that our processes render legitimate outcomes only if he and his people are on the winning side. Any other outcome is illegitimate.\n\nIn retrospect, this previewed much of what we are seeing right now, in the biggest stories of the moment: The battles underway over the vote-counting in the Florida and Georgia contests; the appointment of a Trump loyalist as the new acting attorney general; the White House\u2019s promotion of an apparently doctored video to justify punishing a reporter; and the tactics Trump employed to try to retain the GOP congressional majority.\n\nOn Thursday night, Trump tweeted:\n\nLaw Enforcement is looking into another big corruption scandal having to do with Election Fraud in #Broward and Palm Beach. Florida voted for Rick Scott! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2018\n\nThis \u201cbig corruption scandal having to do with Election Fraud\u201d is that Democrats want the votes to be fully counted in Democratic areas. Basically, what\u2019s happening now is that as the vote-counting continues, the leads of the Republican candidates in Florida\u2019s Senate and gubernatorial contests \u2014 Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis \u2014 have shrunk to within margins that would trigger recounts if they hold. Lawyers have descended.\n\nThere are still votes to be counted, and it\u2019s perfectly possible Scott and DeSantis will win. But the president of the United States is declaring the Senate contest over before the vote-counting is done, and declaring that demands for a full count constitute fraud. While it\u2019s true that Broward County has serious administrative problems, no evidence of fraud has been presented. And so, this is simply a repackaged version of what Trump said during the campaign: Election \u201cfraud\u201d is when the opposition wins.\n\nThe Trump Ethic, more or less, is that no processes that render verdicts against Trump and whoever constitutes his side at the moment can be legitimate or neutral \u2014 by definition. During the campaign, he instructed his supporters to believe this. Now he is continuing this on many fronts, only he\u2019s using official power to broadcast this idea forth and put it into effect. In some cases, Republicans are doing the same. Let\u2019s review:\n\nIn Florida, Republicans aren\u2019t merely declaring themselves the victors. Worse, Scott has ordered state law enforcement to investigate elections officials who are completing vote-counting in Democratic territory. The rationale is highly dubious: As two Florida-based Politico reporters put it, Scott is alleging fraud \u201cwithout providing evidence of fraud,\u201d and he\u2019s \u201cblurring\u201d his official roles as governor and Senate candidate to do so. The president has now endorsed this act.\n\nIn Georgia, the Republican candidate \u2014 Brian Kemp, who doubled as the secretary of state \u2014 oversaw his own election. Kemp initiated a massive voter purge and engaged in other disenfranchising activities. He even used his office to baselessly accuse Democrats of hacking the registration system, which elections expert Rick Hasen described as \u201cperhaps the most outrageous example of election administration partisanship in the modern era.\u201d Once again, the Republican used his official role to manipulate an electoral outcome in which he was a candidate.\n\nOn top of all that, Georgia Republicans are already declaring Kemp the winner of the gubernatorial election, even though the vote-counting continues and it\u2019s at least possible that Kemp could slip below 50 percent, triggering a runoff.\n\nTrump just appointed Matthew Whitaker the acting attorney general, to install a loyalist to oversee special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation. Trump did this in the full knowledge that Whitaker has already publicly said he does not believe key aspects of the probe are legitimate and has already publicly suggested ways that someone in this position could procedurally debilitate it.\n\nThe Whitaker appointment might be illegal without Senate confirmation, but the key point here is that Trump does not want the neutral process of confirmation to unfold, because it would subject Whitaker to scrutiny of his intentions toward Mueller. It remains to be seen whether Whitaker will solicit a Justice Department ethics opinion on the matter \u2014 which also would constitute submitting to a neutral process.\n\nMost Senate Republicans are perfectly fine with much of this. How many have insisted that they should confirm the new attorney general or pass legislation right now to protect Mueller?\n\nTo be clear on what all this really means, Trump\u2019s efforts to get his former attorney general to obstruct the investigation on his behalf, and his reliance on the former House GOP majority to abuse its oversight role to harass and undermine the probe, both failed. Now that Democrats will control the House and will protect the investigation, he\u2019s personally installed a loyalist to undermine the probe, which, it should be noted, is meant to get to the bottom of the circumstances of his own victory and whether it was partly enabled by foreign sabotage (with or without his campaign\u2019s participation) of our democratic processes.\n\nTrump engaged in improper official conduct of the highest order to influence the election: He ordered the military to the border, using it as a prop to dramatize the Republican closing propaganda message about the migrant menace, in hopes of reelecting the GOP House to protect himself from accountability. That failed, but the tactic might have helped boost the GOP Senate majority.\n\nThe White House appears to have circulated doctored video that falsely portrayed CNN reporter Jim Acosta manhandling a White House aide, to justify revoking his credentials after he asked the president tough questions. Whatever you think of Acosta\u2019s conduct, this is plainly a grotesque abuse of official power, and it\u2019s reasonable to ask whether it\u2019s meant to chill other aggressive press scrutiny.\n\nTrump has claimed that if House Democrats investigate his administration, the White House will investigate them back. Whatever he means by this, it\u2019s a threat of official retaliation against Congress for merely exercising its oversight role.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just that no processes are legitimate if they don\u2019t render a victorious outcome for Trump and those on his side. It\u2019s also that no processes or institutions that are supposed to hold Trump accountable or subject him to oversight can be operating in a legitimate fashion \u2014 again, by definition.\n\nAs election law expert Michael McDonald points out, the Florida shenanigans are alarming, because they preview what we might expect from Trump \u2014 who has now endorsed the GOP response to them \u2014 if his 2020 reelection is procedurally in doubt. All this also previews how Trump \u2014 and some Republicans \u2014 will respond if either Florida race goes to a recount or the Georgia race goes to a runoff. It generally signals what to expect from Whitaker\u2019s intentions toward the Mueller investigation; from Trump\u2019s reaction if Mueller finds grave misconduct or criminality; and from Trump\u2019s response once House Democratic oversight begins in earnest.\n\nIn short: All of this is likely to get much, much worse.\n\nRead more:\n\nGOP voter suppression continues, yet Democrats won big anyway\n\nDemocratic legitimacy is on the line in Georgia\n\nAndrew Gillum\u2019s defeat: Florida\u2019s dark racial past reared its head once again\n\nHow the GOP might win in 2020\n\nThe Kavanaugh debacle cost the Democrats the Senate", "The new anchors at China\u2019s state-run news agency have perfect hair and no pulse.\n\nXinhua News just unveiled what it is calling the world\u2019s first news anchors powered by artificial intelligence, at the World Internet Conference on Wednesday in China\u2019s Zhejiang province.

I could say, \u2018That investigation is over.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe could try.\n\nHe could order Sessions\u2019s acting replacement, Matthew G. Whitaker, who has mused wistfully about stifling the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, to play the role of political assassin. He could direct Whitaker to cut the special counsel\u2019s budget to zero. He could tell him to limit the inquiry\u2019s scope. He could try to oust Mueller and to make sure his investigative report never sees the light of day. He could fire the FBI director, Christopher Wray \u2014 just as he fired the previous director, James Comey, last year \u2014 and put a political puppet in his place.\n\nHe could do any or all of these things, as politically foolhardy and constitutionally perilous as they might seem, while the Republicans who control the Senate look on and do nothing.\n\nBut short of sending tanks down Pennsylvania Avenue and blowing the J. Edgar Hoover Building to smithereens, Trump cannot stop the FBI. No commander in chief ever has, not before Hoover died 46 years ago, and certainly not since.\n\nThe 21st-century FBI, for all its flaws, has escaped the darkness of Hoover\u2019s shadow, a legacy of warrantless wiretapping and vengeful attacks against the director\u2019s enemies. It is in great part the creation of Mueller, who ran it from 2001 to 2013. It is decidedly not a political tool to be manipulated by presidents. It is as independent as a hog on ice \u2014 once launched, it has a mind of its own. I\u2019ve been convinced of this while working on a five-hour documentary about how the FBI has confronted presidents who violated their oath of office. (\u201cEnemies \u201d debuts Nov. 18 on Showtime.) The FBI has faced down five commanders in chief who threatened to run the ship of state aground: in the Watergate scandal, in the Iran-contra imbroglio, in the Monica Lewinsky affair, in the matter of post-9/11 spying on Americans and in its criminal investigation of the Trump team. Its record isn\u2019t perfect, but it has by and large upheld the rule of law.\n\nIn no case was a president able to disrupt or derail an FBI investigation. In every case, the bureau preserved evidence, pursued facts and persevered. The truth is that the FBI has the power to say no to presidents, but presidents can\u2019t easily say no to the FBI.\n\nPresidents have been caught bending and even breaking the bounds set by their oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution. The bureau can check them with its immense investigative force, which gives it the ability to execute subpoenas and seize records inside the West Wing, to reveal the deepest secrets and expose the boldest lies: \u201cI\u2019m not a crook.\u201d \u201cWe did not \u2014 repeat, did not \u2014 trade weapons or anything else for hostages.\u201d \u201cI did not have sexual relations with that woman. \u201d The FBI proved these presidential statements false.\n\nThe FBI can\u2019t thwart Trump\u2019s long train of abuses against the Constitution, common sense and common decency. But in time \u2014 since neither can Trump cavalierly counteract the momentum of the evidence accumulating against him and his close confidants \u2014 it may establish that he is a common crook.\n\nPresident George W. Bush couldn\u2019t stop Mueller, then the FBI director, from compelling him to scale back his illegal eavesdropping on Americans. \u201cI am forced to withdraw the FBI from participation in the program,\u201d Mueller wrote in a letter he carried to the White House in 2004. If the president did not back down, \u201cI would be constrained to resign as Director of the FBI.\u201d (Senior Justice Department officials, including Comey and, lest we forget, Wray, also threatened to resign in protest.) Bush backed down.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton couldn\u2019t stop the FBI from drawing blood from his arm; the DNA evidence proved he had lied under oath about his sex life. That led directly to his impeachment.\n\n[Republicans took oversight power from the minority. Democrats should restore it.]\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan couldn\u2019t stop the FBI from raiding the National Security Council\u2019s offices, where agents found proof that the United States had sold weapons to Iran and skimmed the profits to finance the Central American counterrevolutionaries known as the contras, aid that Congress had expressly forbidden. The bureau\u2019s work resulted in the indictments of 12 top national security officials. President George H.W. Bush pardoned the Iran-contra gang, but a law-breaking administration had been caught red-handed and brought to heel by the FBI.\n\nNot even Richard Nixon could stop the G-men. God knows he tried. Trump is no student of history, but he would do well to recall Nixon\u2019s battle with the bureau.\n\nWhen Hoover died in May 1972 \u2014 six weeks before the Watergate break-in \u2014 Nixon installed a politically loyal stooge, L. Patrick Gray, in his place. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be a conspirator,\u201d Nixon counseled Gray. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be totally ruthless.\u201d Nixon tried to sabotage the FBI as soon as it started looking into the break-in, ordering the CIA to obstruct the bureau\u2019s investigation, on spurious national security grounds. Gray destroyed devastating evidence linking the White House to the Watergate burglars. But to a man, the FBI agents on the case fought furiously against Gray\u2019s attempts to undermine them.\n\n[Trump\u2019s real problem is that he obstructed justice, and Mueller can prove it. Here\u2019s how.]\n\nFive leakers at high levels of the bureau made sure word got out. These included not only Associate Director Mark Felt, a.k.a. \u201cDeep Throat,\u201d but the head of the Washington field office, the supervisor who kept the running chronology of the case, and the chief and the lead agent of the white-collar-crime division. \u201cThey would meet at the end of the day and discuss what happened, what they knew, in the investigation,\u201d Paul Daly, an intelligence division agent, said in an FBI oral history. \u201cThey would make a decision, a conscious decision, to leak to the newspapers. They did that because of the White House obstructing the investigation.\u201d\n\nDefying the president, his attorney general and the FBI director, they followed the evidence that made Nixon an unindicted co-conspirator in the obstruction of justice \u2014 and sent the men who had served as his campaign manager, attorney general, chief of staff and counsel to prison.\n\nNixon fired the Watergate special prosecutor and got rid of the attorney general and his deputy, who stood in the way of his wrath. It was all in vain. Though many despaired in the immediate wake of this \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d \u2014 the special prosecutor\u2019s spokesman said he was going home to read up on the Reichstag fire \u2014 a new special prosecutor went to work, and a new attorney general supported him. The wheels of justice rolled on.\n\nTrump may be counting on Whitaker to be his ruthless executioner. The acting attorney general should take care not to become the president\u2019s co-conspirator in any obstruction of justice. Mueller\u2019s grand jury might judge him harshly.\n\nIf Trump follows Nixon down the road to hell, the FBI will be on the case. As Asha Rangappa, a former FBI counterintelligence agent, recently wrote in the New York Times, \u201cTo \u2018shut down\u2019 the investigation at this point would require not just a face-off with Mr. Mueller but also with special agents in charge of multiple field offices with a vested interest in seeing their responsibilities through.\u201d Trump may fight the law, but the law will win in the end.\n\nThe FBI has been toiling on this investigation for almost 18 months. It has the power to pore over the president\u2019s tax returns and his business records. It has proved, through the guilty plea of Trump\u2019s fixer, Michael Cohen, that his hush-money payoffs broke campaign finance laws. Cohen knows the inner workings of the Trump Organization. Paul Manafort knows a great deal about the 2016 Trump campaign, which he ran during and after the Republican National Convention. The government may reveal the extent of their cooperation at their imminent sentencings. Trump cannot derail investigations and prosecutions that may arise from their revelations.\n\nFBI agents have gathered a mountain of evidence for Mueller and for U.S. attorneys in Washington, New York and Virginia. They know a lot about Trump that we do not know. And that evidence can be preserved on flash drives that cannot be deleted by presidential edict \u2014 or shredded by criminal enablers.\n\nTrump could fire the federal prosecutors \u2014 but others would replace them. And under the law, Mueller can be fired only for \u201cgood cause,\u201d such as legal misconduct or a conflict of interest. There is no such cause, despite the president\u2019s baseless assertions that the investigators are politically biased.\n\nEven if Whitaker tries to deep-six the special counsel\u2019s report, the underlying facts cannot be erased. The report will not be easily sealed and suppressed. Democrats in Congress will use subpoena power to try to lay hands on it. They can certainly call Mueller as a witness.\n\nThe FBI and Mueller already have established through indictments and convictions that members of Trump\u2019s team (and Vladi\u00admir Putin\u2019s) participated in a wide-ranging conspiracy to \u201cobstruct the lawful functions of the United States government through fraud and deceit.\u201d The statute at the root of the investigation \u2014 18 USC 371 \u2014 covers violations of tax laws and election laws, witness tampering, money laundering and obstruction of justice. Trump potentially has criminal exposure on at least some of these fronts. And if that catches up to him while he is in office, he has only one clear way out: He can pardon himself. That would abrogate the ancient rule of law holding that no one can be his own judge and jury. Even his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, has called that idea \u201cunthinkable.\u201d\n\nA Justice Department guideline holds that a sitting president cannot be indicted. And so Trump may serve out his time in office untouched by the long arm of the law, unruffled by the prospect of a Senate trial on impeachment, untroubled by the threat of indictment. Citizen Trump, by contrast, may face considerable peril.\n\nHis \u201cenemies,\u201d as Nixon once described any who got in his lawless way, may hold a sliver of hope that someday public servants with the FBI emblem on their backs will visit Trump in one of his gilded palaces and bring him to justice.\n\nRead more from Outlook:\n\nModerate Republicans aren\u2019t dead.

(Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nSince the Democrats won the majority in the House, flipped at least seven governorships and won back majorities in multiple statehouses, President Trump has been on a tear. He:\n\nabused the media and violated the First Amendment by taking away Jim Acosta\u2019s press credentials (while Trump\u2019s press secretary sent around a doctored video, in true Stalinist fashion);\n\nthreatened to investigate the House if the House does its oversight job;\n\nalleged, without any evidence, \u201cElection Fraud\u201d in two Florida counties, suggesting that he\u2019d use \u201claw enforcement\u201d to secure a GOP win in the Senate race there\u201d;\n\nunconstitutionally appointed a vocal critic of the Russia probe, Matthew Whitaker, as acting attorney general; and\n\nunilaterally plans to amend our asylum laws.\n\nIn case you thought Trump was going to straighten up, constitutionally speaking, after losing the protection of House Republicans, think again. Like a wounded animal, he is lashing out at the press, immigrants and Democrats. Is he \u201cgetting away with it\u201d again? Not really.\n\nFor starters, retiring Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) tweeted:\n\nWhen the Senate convenes next week, @ChrisCoons and I will ask for unanimous consent to bring S.2644, the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, to a vote on the Senate floor. After the firing of The AG, it is more important than ever to protect the Special Counsel. \u2014 Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) November 8, 2018\n\nIn support of that, Republicans for the Rule of Law released this video:\n\nTrump\u2019s actions will continue to provoke division among Republicans, forcing some to criticize him and others to embarrass themselves by remaining mute. In the former category, Sen.-elect Mitt Romney (R-Utah) tweeted, \u201cUnder Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, it is imperative that the important work of the Justice Department continues, and that the Mueller investigation proceeds to its conclusion unimpeded.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the courts will be there to check Trump, as we saw in the latest ruling disallowing him from discontinuing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). With regard to the new acting attorney general, lawsuits will fly challenging virtually any action he takes. George Conway (Kellyanne\u2019s husband and a Federalist Society lawyer) and Neal Katyal explain, \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s installation of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general of the United States after forcing the resignation of Jeff Sessions is unconstitutional. It\u2019s illegal. And it means that anything Mr. Whitaker does, or tries to do, in that position is invalid.\u201d)\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s threats are patently ridiculous. He\u2019s really going to get the GOP Senate to investigate the House for conducting oversight that Republicans failed to do? Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure Mr. Trump understands that we\u2019re independent branches of government. And that the legislative branch was set up to be an appropriate check and balance on an executive.\u201d Laughing at the president\u2019s most outlandish ideas is a fine retort, an underutilized tactic against a president with a jumbo ego.\n\nIn Florida, as in other states, voting is largely a state responsibility. Lawyers are descending on Florida in a echo of the 2000 election. Gov. Rick Scott is irresponsibly alleging fraud, but ultimately local officials and the courts will determine the result.\n\nBack inside the Beltway, House Democrats will have the power to hold hearings, subpoena witnesses and documents, and hold non-complying witnesses in contempt. Shining a light on the administration\u2019s skullduggery will strengthen the hand of those resisting improper order and give underlings pause about cooperating. Moreover, the House will slowly build the case for removing \u2014 by election in 2020, most likely \u2014 Trump and his Senate enablers. That worked well in the midterms, and a campaign built around the inarguable proposition that Trump is abusing his power may help reassemble a winning coalition for Democrats.\n\nThe Trump resistance, including groups such as Nobody Is Above the Law, also continue to protest peacefully, both laying down a marker in defense of democratic norms and keeping their own voters engaged and enthusiastic. Trump remains the Democrats\u2019 best organizing tool.\n\nWhat is not, in all likelihood, going to be possible is to impeach and remove Trump. The Senate will remain in GOP hands, making removal (requiring a two-thirds majority) almost inconceivable. Impeaching without removing Trump undoubtedly would fire up his cult and provide weird vindication. Better to investigate, embarrass and \u2014 after he leaves office \u2014 prosecute him for any crimes (e.g. obstruction of justice) taken in office.\n\nRead more:\n\nThree cheers for the moderates\n\nAcosta should sue the president, and Americans should shun Sanders\n\nNow it\u2019s their turn: Blue-state Republicans on the hot seat\n\nThe real \u2018real America\u2019\n\nThree days later: Hey, Republicans really did get clobbered", "ZANZIBAR, Tanzania \u2014 Tanzanian authorities are carrying out physical examinations on 10 men suspected of homosexual activity in Zanzibar, according to police.\n\nA wave of arrests of gays in Tanzania is feared after a senior official urged the public to report suspected homosexuals to authorities.

In 2004, Jon Stewart of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d appeared as a guest and tore into hosts Paul Begala and Tucker Carlson, begging them to \u201cstop hurting America\u201d with their punchy, polarizing show. When CNN canceled \u201cCrossfire\u201d a few months later, network President Joe Klein sided with Stewart. \u201cI agree wholeheartedly with Jon Stewart\u2019s overall premise,\u201d he said, pledging to give up on \u201chead-butting debate shows.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cCrossfire\u201d was a copy, not an innovation. Long before cable outlets began delivering round-the-clock coverage, network news programs pioneered left-right roundtables. In 1971, CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d introduced its \u201cPoint/Counterpoint\u201d segment, pitting conservative segregationist James J. Kilpatrick against liberal Nicholas von Hoffman and then Shana Alexander. Other networks soon followed suit, experimenting with political punditry throughout the 1970s. Even the hallowed halls of public television beat cable news to the punch. In early 1982, PBS launched \u201cThe McLaughlin Group,\u201d a roundtable show featuring pundits like Pat Buchanan and Eleanor Clift. If you want to lament, as Barack Obama did in 2010, that political commentary has devolved into \u201cRock \u2019Em Sock \u2019Em Robots,\u201d you\u2019ll have to start with the networks, not cable.\n\nMyth No. 2\n\nConservatives can't get enough of Fox News.\n\nThe trope holds that conservatives mainline Fox News like a two-pack-a-day smoker inhales cigarettes. It\u2019s even become a subgenre of confessional journalism, where people share their stories of parents radicalized by Fox News. As filmmaker Jen Senko described her own father\u2019s addiction in an interview with the Daily Beast, \u201cHis entire life became consumed by the agendas that were inundating him on the radio, the television, and through the mail.\u201d The news channel\u2019s bright colors, attractive hosts and constant repetition of conservative talking points could be addictive for some, including the president, who is estimated to watch about five hours of television per day.\n\nBut with viewership on the very best days hitting 2.5 million in prime time, Fox News fans account for only a small fraction of conservatives in the United States. Those on the right are far more likely to tune into talk radio than cable news. Radio ratings work differently from television ratings, but Rush Limbaugh says he has the equivalent of 10 to 12 million listeners a day (he hits around 14 million per week). And the three broadcast network news shows draw a combined 22 million viewers a night.\n\nFox News is absolutely influential: It shapes what other outlets cover, feeds the conservative media ecosystem and gives the president his morning talking points. But when it comes to actually watching Fox News, only a fraction of conservatives imbibe.\n\nMyth No. 3\n\nFox News drives the Republican Party rightward.\n\nFox is an easy scapegoat to blame for the GOP\u2019s lurch to the fringe. \u201cThe right-wing echo chamber breeds extremism, intimidates Republican moderates and misleads people into thinking that their worldview is broadly shared,\u201d Nicholas Kristof explained in the New York Times in 2013. Or, as commentator David Frum put it, \u201cRepublicans originally thought that Fox worked for us, and now we\u2019re discovering we work for Fox.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Fox makes conservative viewers even more conservative (and more likely to vote Republican). But overall, the outfit is more weather vane than bellwether, responding to the direction of the base and the GOP instead of setting a course for those groups to follow. Take immigration: In 2013, at the urging of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Fox News hosts gave favorable coverage to the immigration bill that Rubio hoped to push through the Senate. The conservative base resoundingly rejected Fox\u2019s pivot, and hosts like Sean Hannity quickly scurried to anti-immigration positions. And in 2016, when Fox News hosts appeared lukewarm toward Trump, the presidential candidate pilloried them until they fell in line. After his election, the network dumped its anti-Trump commentators and built a prime-time lineup that reflected \u2014 rather than created \u2014 the new direction of the party.\n\nMyth No. 4\n\nMSNBC is the liberal response to Fox.\n\nMSNBC, with its blue palette and its starring role for Rachel Maddow, seems awfully like the political opposite of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s empire. Back in 2013, Dylan Byers wrote in Politico that \u201cone of the great media stories of the 21st century is the rise of MSNBC as a counterbalance to Fox News and a powerful platform for the progressive agenda.\u201d The New York Times\u2019 Alessandra Stanley dubbed the network \u201cFox\u2019s liberal evil twin,\u201d while conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin argued in The Washington Post that it was even worse: Fox News delivered real news, she argued in 2013, while MSNBC just dished out liberal pabulum.\n\nBut these parallels are wrong, both historically and in the present. While Murdoch and Roger Ailes founded Fox News with the intention of establishing a conservative network, MSNBC was launched as simply a chattier, more Gen-X version of NBC News. Even after the network \u201cleaned in\u201d and attempted to develop into a Fox News for progressives starting in 2006, it has never played the same role as Fox. That\u2019s partly because the left doesn\u2019t have the same suspicion of \u201cmainstream media\u201d and partly because MSNBC still tries to model balance. Its morning show is anchored by a conservative, former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough. (The reverse would be unthinkable for Fox.) And it has become whiter and more conservative in the Trump era. Melissa Harris-Perry and Al Sharpton are both out at the network, while Nicolle Wallace, White House director of communications under George W. Bush, now anchors the 4 p.m. hour.\n\nMyth No. 5\n\nCable news is why Americans lost trust in journalism.\n\nNBC\u2019s Chuck Todd blames the \u201cRoger Ailes-created echo chamber\u201d at Fox for the dissolution of trust in American journalism. Trump blames CNN; in Wednesday\u2019s news conference, he declared, \u201cWhen you report fake news \u2014 which CNN does a lot \u2014 you are the enemy of the people.\u201d But while faith has dropped sharply in the decades since the rise of cable news (CNN launched in 1980, Fox and MSNBC in 1996), the cable channels have not been the primary drivers of that decline.\n\nTrust in journalism began to weaken during the Vietnam War, when reporters dutifully repeated the government\u2019s lies about the trajectory of the conflict. It rebounded during Watergate, but it never returned to its 1950s and 1960s heights, when Walter Cronkite was dubbed the most trusted man in America. In the early 1970s, the share of Americans who said they trusted the media hovered between 68 and 72 percent, according to Gallup polls. By 2016 it had slumped to 32 percent.\n\nThat loss of faith was driven not by cable news but by a wholesale ideological attack from the right, which argued that the supposedly objective media was secretly liberal, and a smaller but still important critique from the left of the capitalist and conservative nature of news production. Richard Nixon and his vice president, Spiro Agnew, delighted in discrediting the press, picking up the \u201cliberal bias \u201d arguments that conservatives had already been making for nearly 20 years.\n\nBy the 1980s and 1990s, it was a conservative article of faith that the only news sources that should be trusted were conservative ones. But the continuous cries of liberal media bias didn\u2019t convince only conservatives; they convinced a plurality of Americans \u2014 44 percent as of 2014 \u2014 that the news media was slanted and, increasingly, not to be believed. Fox News capitalized on that trend, but the network didn\u2019t start it. All the negative attributes of media that cable exacerbates \u2014 manufactured urgency, polarized opinion, false equivalency \u2014 began well before CNN, MSNBC and Fox News became such prominent parts of the American political landscape.\n\nFive myths is a weekly feature challenging everything you think you know.

It also helps us understand how the movie itself will work and provides a clue to the central political problem of our time: Who do we listen to, and what stories matter?\n\n\u201cWe wanted to give a shot that kind of educated the audience as to the language we were going to tell this story with,\u201d Reitman said during an interview in the conference room of a Georgetown office. \u201cOn one side, filming, the camera is going to move throughout the room. You are going to be introduced to characters, often you won\u2019t know who they are. You\u2019re going to hear things before you see them, and you\u2019re going to have to figure out for yourself which conversations are worth listening to. And that really kind of delves into the overall philosophy of the film, which is: What is relevant? What is important?\u201d\n\nReitman\u2019s film is based on a book by Matt Bai, currently of Yahoo News and previously of the New York Times Magazine. \u201cAll the Truth Is Out: The Week Politics Went Tabloid\u201d is slim by the standards of books detailing campaigns, clocking in at 250 pages before the index. But no other book has provided a better road map explaining how we arrived at our current political moment.\n\nBai\u2019s sympathies seem to lie with Hart, who went from the front-runner in 1988 to an also-ran in the course of a week after the exposure of a possible affair with Donna Rice, a Miami-based model, actress and pharmaceutical sales representative. Hart, a private, personal man \u2014 and, thus, one ill-suited for certain aspects of modern, celebritized politics \u2014 refused, on principle, to discuss his relationship with Rice, or anyone else for that matter. He simply thought it didn\u2019t matter.\n\nAs it turns out, he was wrong. It did matter. But should it have? We are still dealing with the consequences of why it mattered \u2014 as well as how, exactly, the press and the public alike decide what matters.\n\n\u201cThe reporters, like the operatives, like the candidate in the movie, like the voters and consumers in the movie \u2014 I think in all their perspectives were asking the audience, \u2018Could you see yourself in that situation? What would you choose?\u2019\u201d Bai, who also co-wrote the film along with Reitman and Jay Carson, said. \u201cSometimes for me it\u2019s almost like one of those \u2018Choose Your Own Adventure\u2019 books where I can see the movie three or four different times, and I can follow a different set of choices to a different end. And I think that\u2019s the whole point of it is to ask would you have made that decision, and if you made that decision differently, would it reverberate differently through the years.\u201d\n\nThe team behind \u201cThe Front Runner\u201d does not pretend to have answers to this question; as Carson told me, \u201cpart of the reason we want to tell this story is to show it in gray, to sort of show the messiness of it. And part of that is just asking the question, and we intentionally don\u2019t answer it, but asking the question of what is relevant and when is it relevant?\u201d Before 1988, reporters were happy to cover for pols cheating on their wives, happy to look the other way because they deemed it be none of the public\u2019s business.\n\nWhile watching \u201cThe Front Runner,\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but think back to the 2012 campaign, when the press\u2019s defining moment came in late July, when Mitt Romney was concluding a European tour with a stop in Poland. \u201cWhat about your gaffes?\u201d yelled one of the members of the press corps on the tour. Right before interviewing Reitman, Bai and Carson, I had the displeasure of reading a story about Texas Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke apologizing for a line he wrote in a review of a play in college. Our chat took place amid a press frenzy surrounding Brett M. Kavanaugh, one that combined genuine public interest (the credibility of the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford) with downright prurience (debates over drinking game slang and sentence-by-sentence deconstructions of letters the now-Supreme Court justice wrote as a teenager) in ways that were, at best, of questionable benefit to the public sphere.\n\nThere\u2019s no use crying for some golden age of civility when all our public figures were treated with respect and dignity; no such time has existed since George Washington\u2019s first inaugural address. And there\u2019s something unseemly about journalists deciding to cover up for politicians stepping out on their wives because you were drinking buddies at the Mayflower. But when you reduce politics to a game in which attacks on character supersede debates about political substance, you risk ushering in an age in which the only people interested in running \u2014 and the only people capable of winning \u2014 are those who are either saintly or have no character to besmirch.\n\nUnfortunately, in a world of 24/7 cable news where every story has the potential to go instantly viral on Facebook or Twitter, there\u2019s no easy way back.\n\n\u201cWhat are we bothered by here? Is that the idea of being an adulterer, is it the idea of hypocrisy, or is it simply politicized, and where is this line where publicly meets private? There are no answers for this,\u201d Reitman said, when I asked him if people are more concerned with immorality itself or the hypocrisy of those who claim to be moral acting immorally. \u201cBut it\u2019s something we are obsessed about right now, and [\u2018The Front Runner\u2019] was a way to reflect back upon the audience their own need to answer this question.\u201d", "PARADISE, Calif. \u2014 Leigh Ann Loney, 29, a nursing assistant at a rural hospital in this town of 27,000 in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, said the sense of urgency about a nearby fire was low when she arrived to work early on Thursday morning.\n\nBut the fire was spreading rapidly, its growth sped by abnormally hot, dry and windy conditions that had prompted official warnings up and down the fire-prone state.\n\nWithin a half-hour, the hospital, Adventist Health Feather River, sent out an alert across its loudspeakers that warned of the impending emergency, kicking off a fevered scramble to evacuate the hospital\u2019s patients and staff before the flames subsumed the town. Patients, including many on gurneys or in wheelchairs, were loaded in waiting ambulances, police cars, even some nurses' vehicles as the staff worked to evacuate, Loney said. Within a few hours of the hospital\u2019s evacuation, many of the buildings on its campus were destroyed, with a makeshift medical station set up on a nearby helipad left eerily untouched.\n\nThe story was not unique. Residents across the area, in Butte County about 90 miles north of state capital Sacramento, described fleeing a catastrophic fire that grew with incredible speed and turned a sunny day into an end-of-days scene of flames, smoke, sparks and wide destruction.\n\nAnd the Camp Fire, named for a nearby creek, was not yet done. A state emergency, it had burned at least 90,000 acres, more than 140 square miles, and was only 5 percent contained by Friday night. Officials warned about hot, dry and windy \u201cred flag\u201d conditions persisting on and off through Monday.\n\nButte County Sheriff Kory L. Honea told reporters at a news conference Friday evening that officials had found nine people who had been killed by the fire: Four were found dead in their cars in Paradise, down from the five officials had spoken about earlier; three outside of houses; and two others, one inside a home, and another near a car.\n\nIt had injured an undisclosed number of residents as well as three firefighters. And Honea\u2019s deputies were still looking into some 35 reports of missing people.\n\n\u201cThis event was the worst-case scenario,\" Honea said. \u201cIt\u2019s the event that we have feared for a long time.\"\n\nHundreds of miles south in Ventura County, still reeling from a mass shooting that left 12 people dead, more wildfires had broken out, causing the evacuation of 100,000 people in Thousand Oaks, Malibu and other areas. The Woolsey Fire had burned some 35,000 acres, officials said, while the nearby Hill Fire had burned through 6,000.\n\n[The weather and climate behind the inferno that wrecked Paradise]\n\nBut of all the areas struck by fires in the state so far, Paradise had fared the worst. Its main commercial street transformed into a smoking runway of destruction. Officials said that 6,453 homes and 260 businesses had been destroyed, making the fire the most destructive in California\u2019s history. The previous record holder, the Tubbs Fire in the state\u2019s wine country, was just one year ago.\n\nStories of hope did emerge from the frightening swirl of chaos and devastation. The Adventist Health Feather River was eventually evacuated in its entirety, Loney said, calling it one of the most \u201chorrific but also amazing things,\u201d she\u2019d ever seen. Patients had been funneled out of the hospital through the emergency room with attention to the level of care they required. There were people who had recently been in surgery, she said. Newborns thrust back into the hands of their mothers. Patients with breathing or feeding tubes.\n\nBut getting out of the hospital was just the beginning of the evacuation. The two-lane road next to the hospital was choked with traffic, as the crush of cars fleeing the encroaching flames had slowed to a crawl.\n\nLoney and other residents described a scene that made them question their chances of survival: flames that jumped on both sides of the road, transformers exploding atop ignited electrical poles as tree branches fell and thick plumes of smoke smothered out the sun and turned the air toxic.\n\nStreet signs shimmered in the dancing orange light of the fire. Everything was engulfed. And the traffic was hardly moving.\n\n\u201cThere were no traffic rules, everyone was just fending for themselves, cars bumping into each other,\u201d Loney said, describing two people who exited their cars and started running. She called her brother, wondering if it was the last time she\u2019d speak to him.\n\nOthers described similarly harrowing escapes. Marc Kessler, 55, a science teacher at a public middle school in Paradise, said the sky turned black soon after he arrived at work.\n\n\u201cIt was raining black pieces of soot, coming down like a black snowstorm and starting fires everywhere,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWithin minutes, the town was engulfed.\u201d\n\nTeachers were told by emergency workers to forgo seat-belt laws as they piled 200 or so students into their personal vehicles. Bus drivers drove through flames to help out, he said. One of his students pointed out what they thought was the moon in the darkened sky.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018That\u2019s not the moon. That\u2019s the sun,\u2019 \u201d he recalled, his voice cracking. \u201cThere were times when you couldn\u2019t see though the smoke.\u201d\n\nOther residents, like Mike Kirby, 62, made other plans after seeing the clogged roads. The lifelong Paradise resident had woken to the unnatural darkness outside at 8:30 a.m., and loaded up his trailer. He ended up parking in a cemetery in town \u2014 a \u201clarge area of green,\u201d he said, where he felt he had room to move if he needed to, despite warnings from fire crews.\n\n\u201cI was totally surrounded at one point,\u201d he said. He spent the night there safely; the cemetery was relatively untouched.\n\n[Fast-moving wildfires threaten homes in Southern California, forcing thousands to flee]\n\nThe rest of the town, which has a large community of retirees, did not fare as well. People returning Friday arrived to find much of it destroyed.\n\nHouses lay in ruins along the road, which was littered with the hulls of burned-out cars that had been ditched, and other debris. The strip of businesses downtown that included a Burger King, a Valero gas station, a Jack in the Box and small businesses had been reduced to charred ruins.\n\n#BREAKING We have arrived in downtown #Paradise and I\u2019m so sorry to report...much of the town has been lost, along with hundreds of homes. #abc7now #campfireparadise pic.twitter.com/aYXuU4qkVs \u2014 Laura Anthony (@LauraAnthony7) November 9, 2018\n\nNearby neighborhoods were wiped out as well. For every building that survived, there were dozens that did not. Mayor Jody Jones told reporters that about 80 percent of the homes in town had been burned. Officials said that they did not yet have a complete death count because of the hazards caused by the fire.\n\nIn addition to Paradise, the nearby communities of Magalia, Pulga, Concow, Butte Valley and Butte Creek Canyon were also under evacuation orders. A total of 52,000 people had evacuated officials said; nearly 1,400 were in shelters.\n\nThe harrowing push to flee that so many residents described \u2014 one made even more tenuous because of the traffic \u2014 pointed to questions about whether more planning or infrastructure is needed in an era of catastrophic fires in the state.\n\nScott Lotter, a Paradise Town Council member, said it took him nearly two hours to go a half-mile as he evacuated with his wife, daughter and son-in-law, as well as a pet rabbit and two dogs.\n\nThese abandoned and burned out cars shows you what a panic it must have been for residents trying to escape the Camp Fire.

Ryanair did not publicly comment on the seizure.\n\nFrench aviation agency spokesman Eric Heraud said regional authorities who originally gave the subsidies had been trying since 2014 to recover the money, and sent its final legal warning in May.

(Rich Pedroncelli/AP)\n\nAlmost half of all countries have fertility rates below the replacement level, according to an unprecedented study published by the Lancet journal. While there was not a single nation with a fertility rate below the 2.05 threshold back in 1950, the global average is now only 2.4 \u2014 down from 4.7 about 70 years ago.\n\nDifferences between nations have become more pronounced, with some European countries having record-low rates, down to one child per woman on average, compared to more than six children in some African nations.\n\nIf you live in a poorer nation with high fertility rates, a decrease would probably be a reason for celebration. Lower fertility rates are often the result of fewer child deaths, easily accessible contraception and prosperous economies, which explains why Europe, North America and wealthier Asian nations such as Japan are disproportionately affected.\n\nIn countries with below-replacement level fertility rates, however, the costs outweigh the benefits. Europe has struggled with this challenge for years. Even more so than the United States, European welfare largely depends on a sufficient number of working-age residents who can finance health care, pensions and social security for everyone. The fewer there are, the more complicated it becomes to sustain a system that was set up in a century when falling fertility rates were among the problems people had to worry least about.\n\nAlarmed by continuously dropping figures, some E.U. governments have taken drastic measures. Italy\u2019s Health Ministry launched an advertisement campaign about two years ago to remind citizens that Sept. 22 was \u201cfertility day.\u201d Other countries have sought to address the issue by focusing on education. Denmark, for instance, has started teaching schoolchildren that having babies doesn\u2019t only come with risks but also with benefits.\n\nBut this week\u2019s study raises serious doubts about the impact of such policies or proposals. \u201cPro-natalist policies have been pursued in more than a dozen countries but the effects on fertility rates have not been large,\u201d they wrote. Instead, they argue, an increasingly large share of the world\u2019s population may have to come to terms with higher retirement ages, slashed benefits and \u2014 above all \u2014 probably the most divisive issue of this century so far: migration.\n\nFalling fertility rates do not immediately have to result in receding population numbers, as migration and better health care also impact overall figures, according to the study that was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. While almost half of all nations now have fertility rates below the replacement level, population growth declined in only 33 countries from 2010 to 2017. The countries where population figures remained steady despite lower fertility rates also experienced a higher influx of migrants. The fertility rate in the United States is actually also below replacement levels at 1.8, yet the population is still growing, thanks in large part to immigration.\n\n\u201cIt takes one generation until the population actually starts to decline,\u201d said Christopher Murray, who worked on the study.\n\nDespite the time delay, there\u2019s another factor that has so far saved the United States from following the fate of Europe\u2019s aging societies: migration. The recent fall in net migration has already slowed U.S. population growth and could eventually accelerate a negative trend.\n\nAs other global measures to boost fertility rates have mostly failed, migration has proved to be \u201ceffective in sustaining population numbers in several countries,\u201d the authors of the study write, even though they acknowledge that migration has \u201cbeen accompanied by social and political challenges\u201d in some places.\n\nBased on that analysis, slashing migration numbers \u2014 as the Trump administration is attempting to do \u2014 and operating a budget that relies on a young workforce appears contradictory. Other countries are increasingly aware of that. Confronted with a record-low fertility rate, Japan decided to relax some of its residency laws this months.\n\n\u201cIn the long run, of course, migration can\u2019t be the only fix. Humans would eventually disappear if fertility rates just keep going down,\u201d said Murray, stressing that the United States is still in a better position than many other developed nations where fertility rates dropped below replacement levels decades ago.\n\n\u201cSomething that is still up for debate is whether better financial benefits for parents than currently exist might have a sufficient impact,\u201d he said. Northern Europe\u2019s financial benefits are already much more generous than U.S. benefits, however.\n\nWith the Trump administration\u2019s recent proposals to slash children\u2019s health insurance programs and to toughen immigration laws, it\u2019s a conclusion that will not sit well among many voters in the United States.\n\nMore on WorldViews:\n\nTrump\u2019s nationalism looms over Europe\u2019s WWI commemoration\n\nWhat happened to the caravan after the midterm elections?\n\nA Japanese medical school does an about-face after lowering women\u2019s test scores to help men", "THE HAGUE, Netherlands \u2014 Dutch officials said Friday they will prosecute a nursing home doctor for euthanizing an elderly woman with dementia, the first time a doctor has been charged since the Netherlands legalized euthanasia in 2002.\n\nDutch prosecutors said in a statement the doctor \u201chad not acted carefully\u201d and \u201coverstepped a line\u201d when she performed euthanasia. Officials first began probing the case in September, when they found the doctor had drugged the patient\u2019s coffee and then had family members hold her down while delivering the fatal injection.\n\nThe doctor said she was fulfilling the patient\u2019s earlier euthanasia request and that since the patient was not competent, nothing the woman said during her euthanasia procedure was relevant.\n\nBut Dutch prosecutors argued that the patient\u2019s written euthanasia request was \u201cunclear and contradictory.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn her living will, the woman wrote that she wanted to be euthanized \u2018whenever I think the time is right.\u2019 But after being asked several times in the nursing home whether she wanted to die, she said, \u2018Not just now, it\u2019s not so bad yet,\u2019\u201d according to an earlier report by one of the Netherlands\u2019 euthanasia review committees.\n\n\u201cEven if the patient had said at that moment: \u2018I don\u2019t want to die,\u2019 the physician would have continued,\u201d the committee wrote, citing the doctor\u2019s own testimony.\n\nProsecutors said on Friday that the doctor should have verified with the patient whether or not she still wanted to die and that \u201cthe fact that she had become demented does not alter this.\u201d\n\nJohan Legemaate, a professor of health law at the University of Amsterdam, said: \u201cThe patient\u2019s declaration has to be clear enough to the situation so doctors know when euthanasia can be applied.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut should this include a situation where doctors are drugging patients secretly? It\u2019s now for the court to decide whether this doctor acted within the required limits,\u201d he added.\n\nLegemaate said that there were very few cases of euthanasia in patients with advanced dementia, but that the decision to prosecute the doctor in this case might provoke more caution among health professionals.\n\nRene Heman, chairman of the Dutch Doctors Federation, said he respected how open the doctor had been about the case.\n\n\u201cCriminal law is always the last possible resort after a report of euthanasia,\u201d he said, noting that euthanizing people with advanced dementia continued to be very controversial.\n\nThe Netherlands is one of five countries that allow doctors to kill patients at their request, and one of two, along with Belgium, that grant the procedure for people with mental illness. For those with late-stage dementia, euthanasia is still possible if the person made a written demand specifying the conditions under which they want to be killed and if other criteria are met, namely if the doctor agrees the patient is suffering unbearably with no prospect of improvement.\n\n\u201cIf the Dutch had decided not to prosecute this case, that would send a message that if a patient is incompetent, doctors can essentially do whatever they want,\u201d said Scott Kim, an ethicist at the U.S. National Institutes of Health.\n\n\u201cA case like this should serve as a warning for other countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Dutch seem to be recognizing that certain practices are out of bounds.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, friends of Audrey Parker, a euthanasia advocate in Canada, which legalized the procedure in 2016, said she was forced to end her life \u201cprematurely\u201d because the law only allows patients who are mentally competent to be killed.\n\nA pro-euthanasia organization said it would soon be launching a campaign to challenge the Canadian law so that people can be euthanized even when they lack capacity.\n\nDutch prosecutors are also examining two other criminal investigations into doctors who performed euthanasia in questionable circumstances; two other cases were recently dropped.\n\n___\n\nCheng reported from London.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The uproar surrounding Aasia Bibi _ a Pakistani Christian woman who was acquitted of blasphemy charges and released from death row but remains in isolation for her protection _ has drawn attention to the plight of the country\u2019s Christians.The minority, among Pakistan\u2019s poorest, has faced an increasingly intolerant atmosphere in this Muslim-majority nation where radical religious and sectarian groups have become more prominent in recent years. (B.K. Bangash, File/Associated Press)\n\nISLAMABAD \u2014 The uproar surrounding Aasia Bibi \u2014 a Pakistani Christian woman who was acquitted of blasphemy charges and released from death row but remains at a secret location for her protection \u2014 has drawn attention to the plight of the country\u2019s Christians.\n\nThe minority, among Pakistan\u2019s poorest, has faced an increasingly intolerant atmosphere in this Muslim-majority nation where radical religious and sectarian groups have become more prominent in recent years.\n\nHere is a look at some of the issues involved.\n\n___\n\nWHY HER RELEASE IGNITED AN UPROAR\n\nBibi\u2019s Oct. 31 acquittal by Pakistan\u2019s supreme court triggered large-scale protests, with religious extremists demanding the 54-year-old mother of five be publicly executed \u2014 and that the three judges who set her free also be put to death.\n\nHer ordeal started in 2009 after two fellow women farmworkers refused to drink from the same container as a Christian, and later said Bibi had insulted the Prophet Muhammad. The claim led to her arrest and 2010 death sentence on blasphemy charges. In Pakistan, a mere accusation of blasphemy has caused riots, even lynching.\n\nRights groups have said Pakistan\u2019s blasphemy law is often used as an excuse to settle scores, or as a weapon against religious minorities, including Shiite Muslims who are at times targeted by Sunni Muslim militants as heretics.\n\nBibi has been in hiding in Islamabad since her release earlier this week. Her family says she will leave Pakistan as soon as possible because of death threats against her.\n\n___\n\nWHO THE PAKISTANI CHRISTIANS ARE\n\nThere are about 1.3 million Christians in Pakistan, a predominantly Sunni Muslim country of 204 million people. The Christians are the second-largest minority, after Hindus, and are almost evenly divided between Catholic and Protestant denominations.\n\nThe Christian population grew at the time of Pakistan\u2019s creation in 1947, when the Indian subcontinent was divided into two nations. At the time, many lower caste Hindus, living in what would become Pakistan, converted to Christianity. They were among the region\u2019s poorest and held jobs many others didn\u2019t want.\n\nAlthough some Christians have risen to senior positions, including A.R. Cornelius who served as Pakistan\u2019s chief justice, many live in impoverished communities commonly referred to as \u201csweeper colonies\u201d because residents are employed as domestic and sanitation workers.\n\n___\n\nHOW PAKISTAN\u2019S GOVERNMENTS HAVE TREATED CHRISTIANS\n\nThe rise of Islamic radicalism in Pakistan has left the country\u2019s minority religions vulnerable. The blasphemy law, which carries the death penalty for anyone convicted of insulting Islam, has been used at times as a tool against minorities. Christian churches and homes have been attacked by crowds invoking the law.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan, elected in July, in part on an Islamic agenda, has vacillated between criticizing religious parties for using religion to enhance their influence, and bowing to their demands, including firing minorities from government-appointed positions.\n\nIn Bibi\u2019s case, Khan seemingly caved to the Islamists\u2019 demand to have her acquittal reviewed in an appeal \u2014 though some suspected he was trying to buy time to disperse the protesters.\n\nAnalysts say mixed signals from the government only embolden extremists. Minority religious leaders also say the poverty of the Christian minority sharply reduces their political clout.\n\n___\n\nHOW CHRISTIANS ARE FARING IN OTHER MUSLIM-MAJORITY COUNTRIES\n\nEgypt\u2019s Christians, who make up about 10 percent of the country\u2019s 100 million Muslim-majority population, have long complained of discrimination and under-representation in government. Sectarian violence occasionally erupts in rural communities where Christian churches have been torched. Overwhelmingly, attacks on Egyptian Copts have been carried out by Islamist extremists, mainly the Islamic State group, which has killed scores of Christians in recent years.\n\nLebanon\u2019s Christian community is the second-largest in the Middle East, after Egypt\u2019s, but has gone from being a majority to ranging between 30 and 35 percent of the population. Despite their dwindling numbers, Lebanese Christians still retain relative political power with multiple political parties and a president, who must be a Christian Maronite, according to an unwritten national pact.\n\nAcross the Holy Land, Christians now make up an estimated 1 to 2 percent of the population, a marked decline over the decades. Reasons include a relatively low birth rate and increased emigration by Palestinian Christians, driven by the fallout from the long-running conflict with Israel. In the Gaza Strip, the number of Christians has dropped from 3,000 to 1,000 over the past decade of rule by the Islamic militant group Hamas \u2014 a period that has been marked by armed conflict with Israel, border closures and soaring unemployment.\n\nIraq has been seeing a dramatic exodus of its Christians since dictator Saddam Hussein was ousted in 2003. Muslim extremists, mostly from the al-Qaida terror network and later the Islamic State group, have bombed churches and shrines in Baghdad and the city of Mosul, and assassinated high-level bishops and priests. There were thought to be over 1 million Christians living in Iraq before the U.S.-led invasion of 2003; today only a fraction remains.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Menna Zaki in Cairo, Philip Issa in Baghdad, Fares Akram in Gaza City, Gaza Strip, and Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Amnesty International said warned late Wednesday. Nov. 7, 2018 that Yemen\u2019s rebels have taken up positions on a hospital rooftop in the contested Red Sea city of Hodeida that a Saudi-led coalition is trying to capture. This raises concerns the Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, plan to use the patients at the Hodeida hospital as human shields to ward off airstrikes from the coalition. Amnesty is urging the warring sides to protect civilians. (Hani Mohammed, File/Associated Press)\n\nCAIRO \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of Yemenis from the Hodeida area have been forced to flee amid a Saudi-led coalition offensive to take the key Red Sea port city from Shiite rebels, the United Nations\u2019 refugee agency said Friday, as fierce battles continue to rage in the area.\n\nSome 445,000 of the Hodeida governorate\u2019s residents have fled since June, a figure that underscores the dire situation in and around the city that serves as the main entry point for food and aid, the UNHCR said. The governorate\u2019s population is around 3 million, according to figures from the Norwegian Refugee Council.\n\nThe UNHCR also expressed concern over the safety of those trapped in Hodeida as the intensified military operations \u201care increasingly confining populations and cutting off exit routes.\u201d Figures on those still in Hodeida are difficult to gauge, the agency added.\n\nYemeni government forces supported by the coalition\u2019s air and naval forces continue to engage in heavy fighting with the rebels, known as Houthis. The fighting has killed dozens of combatants from both sides, with dozens of military vehicles destroyed or burning along the front lines.\n\nIn a Friday statement, Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government based in the southern city of Aden said its forces are advancing toward the north and west of Hodeida and across all fronts with cover from the coalition.\n\nAlso on Friday, the World Health Organization said the violence in Hodeida is in close proximity to the city\u2019s health facilities, impeding their ability to function and restricting the movement of health staff, patients and ambulances.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition\u2019s latest push toward Hodeida comes as Yemen\u2019s civil war is a few months away from entering its fourth year. The coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 with the aim of defeating the Iran-aligned rebels and to restore the government of Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. But the coalition has recently come under mounting international pressure to end the war that has resulted in what the U.N. says is the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe fighting around the city, a vital lifeline for most of Yemen\u2019s population, threatens to worsen Yemen\u2019s already-dire humanitarian situation and risks the obstruction of crucial assistance to the country endangering the lives of millions of Yemenis.\n\nThe Norwegian Refugee Council warned of the repercussions the continued fighting may have on millions of Yemenis. The council estimates the humanitarian cost of the war to have reached almost $3 billion in 2018 alone, it said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe are now warning that by allowing this to go on, parties to the conflict and their international backers will be responsible for the death, injury and suffering of millions of people,\u201d Mohamed Abdi, the council\u2019s director in Yemen, said in a statement. \u201cSenseless attacks on civilians, evidence of a starving population and desperate pleas from humanitarian witnesses have done little more than elicit condolences from an international community that could have stepped on the brakes long ago.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. and U.K., major arms suppliers to the Saudi coalition, have recently called for a cease-fire in Yemen and the launch of U.N.-led political talks to end the Saudi-Iran proxy war. On Friday, the U.N. special envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths said on his official Twitter account that consultations with Yemen\u2019s warring parties to finalize logistical arrangements for a new round of peace talks are underway. Griffiths\u2019 latest effort to revive peace talks in September fell through after the Houthis failed to attend.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

His new book, \u201cConversations with RBG,\u201d will be published next year.\n\n\n\nBefore her appointment to the Supreme Court 25 years ago, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the head of the ACLU\u2019s women\u2019s rights project and argued landmark cases on gender equality. (Photo by Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post)\n\nWhy has Ruth Bader Ginsburg, at the age of 85, become an American icon whom young women stop for selfies in the street? The simple answer: She\u2019s such a boss. Young women see in her a model of energy, steely determination in the face of injustice, self-mastery and humor that inspired a New York University law student to create the meme \u201cthe Notorious RBG.\u201d Less-young men and women celebrate her as the Thurgood Marshall of the women\u2019s movement, the lawyer who did more than any other to advance the cause of gender equality as a pathbreaking advocate for the ACLU in the 1970s. And over the course of her career, conservatives as well as liberals have hailed her as a judge\u2019s judge whose personal and judicial restraint, tireless preparation, and mastery of the facts and precedents have led her to advance the cause of equal justice under the law through what she calls \u201cmeasured motions\u201d rather than sweeping exercises of judicial power.\n\nFor all these reasons, the 25th anniversary of Ginsburg\u2019s appointment to the Supreme Court has inspired several books and movies, from a recent documentary to a forthcoming biopic with Felicity Jones. (I\u2019ve known RBG for nearly 30 years, ever since we bonded over opera when I was a law clerk on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and, with her permission, I am collecting my conversations with her into a book that will be published next fall.) Despite this cascade of tributes, Jane Sherron De Hart\u2019s \u201cRuth Bader Ginsburg: A Life\u201d marks the first full-length biography of the justice.\n\nDe Hart began the book as an exploration of Ginsburg\u2019s late-1960s litigation strategy, which sought to secure gender equality through ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment and Supreme Court litigation. On this basis, RBG granted De Hart access to her litigation archives, as well six interviews between 2000 and 2005. De Hart then decided to expand the book into a full-scale biography, despite the fact that Ginsburg\u2019s official biographers, Mary Hartnett and Wendy W. Williams, are still at work. For this reason, RBG resisted sharing extensive reflections on her life with De Hart, and the book does not contain her candid thoughts on the future of the Supreme Court and the Constitution. Nevertheless, De Hart has written an excellent biography based on archives and interviews with colleagues and friends: In its comprehensiveness, range and attention to detail, this is a vivid account of a remarkable life.\n\nDe Hart\u2019s biography makes clear that Ginsburg\u2019s academic excellence, unwavering focus and unparalleled self-discipline were cultivated at an early age. Her most important influence was her mother, Celia, a passionate reader who came to the Lower East Side of New York from Poland and once, while walking down the street with her head buried in a book, actually fell and broke her nose. Celia, whom Ginsburg called \u201cstrict and loving,\u201d resolved that her daughter should \u201clove learning, care about people, and work hard\u201d to achieve her goals. Throughout her life, Ginsburg has surpassed these high expectations. Celia also taught her daughter to control unproductive emotions, such as anger, through relentless self-mastery: \u201cBe a lady,\u201d she frequently exhorted. Her mother died days before young Ruth\u2019s high school graduation; Ginsburg later recalled her as \u201cthe strongest and bravest person I have ever known.\u201d\n\nRuth Bader excelled at Cornell, where she studied with Vladimir Nabokov, who taught her the importance of choosing words with precision, and the great civil libertarians Robert Cushman and Milton Konvitz, who kindled her passion for constitutional law. Classmates recalled her as \u201cscary smart\u201d with \u201ca natural ability to be logical and reasoned, and not let emotions get in her way.\u201d She graduated second in her Cornell class, with highest honors.\n\nAt Cornell, she met Marty Ginsburg and concluded, \u201cHe was the only guy I ever dated who cared whether I had a brain.\u201d Their storied marriage of equals began with a two-year stint at Fort Sill, Okla., where they shared responsibility for child care and read to each other from Tolstoy and Spinoza. They then set off together for Harvard Law School, where the dean asked each of the nine women in the class at a welcoming party why she was taking a place that could have gone to a man. Ginsburg made the law review and ended her first year near the top of the class. She found the emphasis on legal process at Harvard \u201cspellbinding\u201d in its focus on practical facts and fair procedures rather than sweeping ideology. When Marty got a job in New York, Ginsburg transferred to Columbia Law School, where her reputation as \u201cthe smartest person on the East Coast\u201d preceded her, and she tied for first place in the graduating class. Despite her dazzling success, she received no offers from law firms because, as she later put it, \u201cto be a woman, a Jew and a mother to boot\u201d was \u201ca bit much\u201d in 1959.\n\nInstead, she clerked for a federal judge (but not Learned Hand or Justice Felix Frankfurter, who refused to hire women) and then went on to become, as head of the ACLU\u2019s women\u2019s rights project, the most influential litigator of gender equality of our time. De Hart\u2019s chapters on the landmark cases Ginsburg argued, which were the original core of her book project, are detailed and accessible. It\u2019s especially helpful to read about the feminist passion that gripped Ginsburg after she read Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s \u201cThe Second Sex\u201d while preparing to teach a class on women and the law in the early 1970s: \u201cShe sort of caught fire,\u201d recalled a colleague. It\u2019s well known that Ginsburg appealed to sexist male judges by representing male plaintiffs who had been disadvantaged by laws ostensibly favoring women while in fact enshrining gender stereotypes.\n\nDe Hart reminds us of the sweep of Ginsburg\u2019s feminist vision, which sought to change not only the law but also institutions and practices that constrained women\u2019s abilities to define their own paths. To change the law, Ginsburg realized, she would have to change public opinion, since the courts would take into account the actions of Congress and the executive branch. And even at the end of her string of Supreme Court victories, according to De Hart, Ginsburg lamented that the failure of the Equal Rights Amendment meant that the court would remain unwilling to root out unconscious gender bias, focusing only on intentional discrimination.\n\nIn telling the story of Ginsburg\u2019s appointment to the Supreme Court, De Hart reminds us that leading feminist groups were ambivalent about her candidacy, or even opposed to it, because of her criticisms of Roe v. Wade. Ginsburg had (presciently) criticized Roe for being decided too broadly, in ways that provoked an unnecessary backlash, and for focusing on the amorphous right to privacy rather than equal protection \u2014 the ways that restrictions on abortion discriminate on the basis of sex by limiting the opportunities of women rather than men. But once nominated, Ginsburg was hailed as a unifying and collegial centrist by conservatives as well as liberals and was confirmed by a nearly unanimous margin that now seems unimaginable.\n\nHow did the unifying centrist apotheosize into the Notorious RBG, a revered icon of fiery dissent? De Hart traces the transformation to 2006, when Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito succeeded Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, creating a solid conservative majority. Ginsburg\u2019s dissent from Alito\u2019s decision in the Lilly Ledbetter case on workplace discrimination galvanized Congress to overturn it. Wearing her \u201c \u2018black and grim\u2019 dissenting collar,\u201d Ginsburg read her dissents from the bench only six times during her first decade on the bench and 13 times between 2006 and 2015.\n\nGinsburg\u2019s position as the leader of the court\u2019s liberal wing was formalized in 2010 with the retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens. She convinced the other liberal justices \u2014 Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2014 that their dissents would have more force if they spoke together rather than separately. That\u2019s why the leading dissenting opinions of the post-2010 Roberts court have been written by Ginsburg \u2014 including her 2013 dissent in the Shelby County voting rights case, which sparked the Notorious RBG meme.\n\nToday, at 85, Ginsburg retains her astonishing work ethic, self-discipline and passionate commitment to equality, with a serene sense of the limits of judicial power and the need to inspire youth to achieve social change. Still a night owl, she continues to leave messages for her clerks at 3 in the morning and to produce opinion drafts faster than her colleagues. Her astonishing recall of facts and attention to detail have been combined with the wisdom of a life spent confronting inequality and overcoming it in measured motions, step by step. The ovations she receives at the opera and pop-culture tributes on the Internet have not affected her clear-eyed focus on her ultimate goal, which is a Constitution that includes ever more individuals in what she calls \u201cequal citizenship stature.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe standing ovations, the lovely hand-tatted lace collar gifted to her by a student, the Notorious R.B.G. Tumblr, the T-shirts and coffee mugs bearing her likeness, the children\u2019s books, the R.B.G. documentary, the forthcoming film starring Felicity Jones and Arnie Hammer as a young Ruth and Marty with the justice providing a cameo appearance, even the spoof on \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 \u2014 all are evidence that Ginsburg has indeed made her mark not only on the jurisprudence of the United States but also on American society and popular culture more broadly,\u201d De Hart concludes.\n\nHaving transformed herself from a judicial priest to a judicial prophet, Ginsburg\u2019s place in American history will endure.", "", "", "\n\nScallop crudo with buttermilk, dill and dried scallop at Reverie in Georgetown.

With dozens of Democrats interested, some have said they will make a decision by year\u2019s end. That\u2019s just a few weeks away.\n\nWhat did the 2018 elections mean for 2020? It\u2019s difficult to say. Had Democrats notched a more resounding success \u2014 with fewer Senate losses \u2014 the clear verdict would have been to stay the course and maybe go with a more traditional nominee. Those unhelpful losses, though, are likely to leave uncertainty about exactly what the party needs at the top of the ticket in 2020. If Democrats are still struggling to win Florida even in a good environment, for example, maybe that\u2019s cause for concern.\n\nSo who leads the way? As I do every few months, here\u2019s my latest list of the top 15 contenders.\n\nOff the previous list: Eric Holder, Oprah Winfrey, Chris Murphy, Mitch Landrieu, Andrew M.

Rep. John Delaney (Md.): Points here for getting in early. The retiring Maryland congressman and presidential long-shot is a declared candidate and has been hitting Iowa hard for months (adopting the Chris Dodd/Rick Santorum model). He\u2019s running as something of a pro-business New Democrat, which seems anathema to where the party is right now. But if there are a ton of candidates, notching a respectable finish in Iowa won\u2019t require a huge chunk of votes.\n\n14. Michael Avenatti: I know what you\u2019re thinking, and I don\u2019t blame you. Four months ago, I would have judged myself for putting Avenatti on this list \u2014 hard. I also don\u2019t think he did himself any favors with his role in the Brett M. Kavanaugh confirmation process. But Democrats are starting to warm to his brash, in-your-face style, and some, like Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder, are even newly embracing a version of it themselves. Former attorney general Holder\u2019s \u201cWhen they go low, we kick \u2018em\u201d comment last month notably came months after Avenatti said, \u201cWhen they go low, we hit harder.\u201d And if Democrats take a flier like Republicans did in 2016, who knows?\n\n13. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick: Patrick admitted a couple months ago that he\u2019s not sure he sees a place for himself in the 2020 race. I still think he would be formidable if he did run \u2014 especially given the enthusiasm among some Obama types.\n\n12. Hillary Clinton: In an interview a few weeks ago, Clinton began talking about how qualified she felt to be our next president. It may have been wistfulness more than anything signaling real intent \u2014 and she also said, \u201cNo, no,\u201d when asked whether she wants to run again. But it\u2019s difficult not to believe she wasn\u2019t at least planting a seed of doubt and sending a signal to other would-be candidates that she reserves the right \u2014 even if it\u2019s unlikely \u2014 to jump in.\n\n11. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.): The Minnesota senator\u2019s 24-point reelection win on Tuesday was never in doubt, but it was emphatic. And notably, she did well in the rural areas along the Iron Range and in Southern Minnesota that Democrats are struggling to hold in the Trump era. If Democrats want a pragmatic, smart pick, she\u2019s making a case for it. She\u2019s not the liberal fire-breather some want, though.\n\n10. Former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe: McAuliffe assured us he was going to Iowa back in September to help fire up Democrats. But he also made a point to do that in New Hampshire in October.\n\n9. Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg: Bloomberg plugged a huge amount of money into the 2018 election for Democrats \u2014 $110 million, all told, according to his team. But after so many head-fakes about running for president, does he actually do it this time? The fact that the former Republican and independent recently registered as a Democrat \u2014 after not bothering to do so in recent years \u2014 would seem a potential clue.\n\n8. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (Tex.): He lost to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). It didn\u2019t work out. The $70 million he raised couldn\u2019t overcome Texas\u2019s quarter-century without electing a Democrat statewide. But it was close \u2014 only a three-point gap. If you\u2019d have offered that at the start of the race, I would have said it was very impressive. He would have been higher on this list if he had won, but he has earned a ticket to ride in a Democratic Party badly in need of young stars.\n\n7. Sen. Sherrod Brown (Ohio): Nobody who was running for reelection on Tuesday leaned as hard into the next campaign as Brown. In a brief victory speech, he noted that he won even as Trump had carried Ohio by eight points in 2016. \u201cThat is the message coming out of Ohio in 2018, and that is the blueprint for our nation in 2020,\u201d he concluded. That\u2019s notable from a guy who said before that he wasn\u2019t actively considering a run. Perhaps ensuring reelection just had to come first.\n\n6. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.): Gillibrand said during a debate for her (uncompetitive) reelection bid that she would serve out her six-year term if she won. But then she seemed to reopen the door to a run just two days after the election on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d\n\nGillibrand to Colbert just now, on the 2020 question: \"I believe it is a moral question for me \u2026 I\u2019ve seen the hatred and division that President Trump has put out into our country \u2026 I will promise you I will give it a long, hard thought, consideration. I will do that.\" \u2014 Gabriel Debenedetti (@gdebenedetti) November 9, 2018\n\n5. Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.): Booker can be hugely impressive; he can also be over the top. And his performances during the Kavanaugh hearings trended toward the latter. A tip: It\u2019s not an \u201cI am Spartacus\u201d moment if you have to call it an \u201cI am Spartacus moment.\u201d Not to focus too much on one moment, but this was a big and unforgettable one.\n\n4. Former vice president Joe Biden: A recent CNN poll made Biden the big, early favorite for the Democratic nomination \u2014 33 percent to 13 percent for Bernie Sanders \u2014 which is a bit surprising. Lots and lots of Democrats voted for Sanders in 2016, after all. I\u2019m not convinced that Biden jumps in, and his track record as a presidential candidate isn\u2019t good. But the stage is set.\n\n3. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.): Perhaps nobody on this list has Harris\u2019s upside -- if she puts it all together -- and that upside is worth a lot in what\u2019s almost undoubtedly going to be such a crowded field.\n\n2. Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.): Sanders ran a somewhat sleepy reelection race (which was all that was required), and I keep half-expecting him to assert himself as a national leader of the Democrats \u2014 kind of how he attempted to during that tour with DNC Chairman Tom Perez. Maybe he recognizes that he doesn\u2019t need all that, and he can just turn his base on the moment he starts running again. We\u2019ll see.\n\n1. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.): No, Warren\u2019s disclosure of a DNA report showing very slight Native American ancestry didn\u2019t exactly go swimmingly. But as a signal of her intent to run, it was as strong as anything. I\u2019ve often felt that if she runs, she\u2019s probably the favorite. She needed to get this out of the way, and she\u2019s trying.", "LONDON \u2014 It\u2019s the end of an era for Britain\u2019s Royal Air Force: Its only bomb disposal squadron is being disbanded, 75 years after it was formed to disarm unexploded German bombs.\n\nAn RAF spokesman said Friday there will be \u201cno change to public safety\u201d when the 5131 Bomb Disposal Squadron is phased out in April 2020.\n\nRAF personnel with the bomb disposal unit will be given other positions with the air force.

France\u2019s prime minister is sounding the alarm over a sharp rise in anti-Semitic acts this year, pledging to increase efforts to punish perpetrators and police hate speech online. (Christophe Ena, File/Associated Press)\n\nPARIS \u2014 France\u2019s prime minister sounded the alarm Friday over a sharp rise in anti-Semitic acts this year, pledging to increase efforts to punish perpetrators and police hate speech that is flourishing online.\n\nResurgent anti-Semitism is of national concern in a country with Europe\u2019s largest Jewish population, which still struggles to wash away the stain of collaboration with the Nazis and in recent years has seen deadly Islamic extremist attacks targeting Jewish sites.\n\nPrime Minister Edouard Philippe announced on his Facebook page a 69 percent rise in the number of anti-Semitic acts reported to police in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the same period last year.\n\nThe government couldn\u2019t give a reason for the rise, but Jewish leaders lamented the explosion of hate speech online and beyond.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this feeling that something has opened up, a gateway to intolerance and hate,\u201d said rabbi and researcher Delphine Horvilleur. \u201cWords kill. It starts with words and very quickly they turn into acts,\u201d she said, noting the recent deadly attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.\n\nDespite years of French government efforts to fight it, \u201cwe are very far from having finished with anti-Semitism,\u201d the prime minister wrote. He expressed particular concern because overall, anti-Semitic acts had been on the decline in recent years.\n\nThe government won\u2019t release specific figures until the end of the year. Over all of 2017, the government reported 311 anti-Semitic acts, from threats to swastikas on Jewish gravesites to physical attacks on people wearing kippas. That was down from 335 the year before, but the number of violent anti-Semitic acts rose, along with anti-Muslim and other violent hate crimes.\n\nThe Interior Ministry said part of the recent rise could be attributed to a government push over the past year to encourage people to report hate crimes, including a new online portal to file police reports.\n\nThe prime minister promised new measures to better handle victims and punish perpetrators, to take down potentially violent hate speech online more quickly and to help teachers who report anti-Semitic behavior.\n\n\u201cEach attack against one of our compatriots because he or she is Jewish resonates like new broken glass,\u201d the prime minister said, in reference to the mass crackdown on Jews throughout Germany and Austria on Nov. 9, 1938 known as the Night of Broken Glass, or Kristallnacht. \u201cIt is up to each French person to mobilize \u2018for\u2019 something: for life together, for France\u2019s identity, for the values of the Republic.\u201d\n\nIslamic extremists targeted a Jewish school and kosher supermarket in two of France\u2019s most deadly terrorist attacks in recent years, and some blame Islamic radicalism for resurgent anti-Semitism in France. Muslim leaders acknowledge that some imams have fueled radicalism, but warn against stigmatizing France\u2019s millions of moderate Muslims.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that when the Jews are targeted it means something is wrong within society,\u201d said Horvilleur, the rabbi. \u201cWe have to fight together. Anti-Semitism is not a Jewish problem. ... It\u2019s the nation\u2019s problem.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Charles de Gaulle.\n\nWith stops at once-bloody battlefields and poignant WWI memorials, Macron achieved one of his main goals: To highlight soldiers\u2019 sacrifices and sound renewed warnings about European division and rising nationalism, dangers he is increasingly concerned about.\n\nBut the commemorative pathos and broader message were also polluted by the more immediate concerns of citizens he met. In the town of Charleville-Mezieres, where Macron had his entire cabinet hold its weekly meeting, instead of in his gilded offices at the Elysee Palace in Paris, a retiree challenged him over shrinking pensions.\n\nAnd he\u2019s had to repeatedly defend his government\u2019s policies on fuel. High prices at the pumps have dominated news bulletins. Crude oil prices are largely to blame. But Macron\u2019s government has also hiked fuel taxes to fight pollution, angering drivers and truckers who plan to protest by blocking roads across France next week.\n\n\u201cI prefer taxing fuel to taxing labor. People complaining about rising fuel prices are the same ones who complain about pollution and how their children suffer,\u201d Macron said in an interview to regional newspapers.\n\nFending off criticism about fuel and pensions wasn\u2019t the main goal for Macron\u2019s aides as they carefully choreographed his tour through regions among the hardest-hit by deindustrialization and agricultural difficulties. With rates of unemployment and poverty above the national average, France\u2019s northeast is pock-marked by discontent that has proved to be fertile ground for far-right French nationalist leader Marine Le Pen, beaten by Macron in last year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nMacron said, however, that he was happy for the opportunity to deal with people\u2019s grievances directly.\n\n\u201cThere are days when people are angry,\u201d he said Thursday as he toured a Renault car factory hailed as a model of productivity. \u201cI need to explain what I do to those who are angry, to respect them and listen to them. That\u2019s what I do.\u201d\n\nThe confused and mixed messaging that came out of Macron\u2019s tour was also partly his fault. On Wednesday, he stirred controversy and angered France\u2019s main Jewish group by speaking favorably of the World War I record of Marshal Philippe Petain \u2014 a general who subsequently became a top collaborator with the Nazis in World War II.\n\nMacron\u2019s domestic troubles won\u2019t hinder his role as WWI commemoration-organizer-in-chief this weekend.\n\nIndeed, hosting Trump, Putin and other world leaders could offer a welcome moment of respite.\n\n___\n\nSylvie Corbet has covered French politics for The Associated Press since 2010.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Whitaker was a regular critic of the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, according to nearly eight hours of media appearances reviewed by The Fix, highlights of which you can watch in the video above.\n\nWhile praising special counsel Robert S. Mueller III (\u201ca good pick\u201d), Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein (\u201ca straight shooter\u201d) and former FBI director James B. Comey (\u201cthe pro\u2019s pro\u201d), Whitaker simultaneously undermined two central parts of the Russia probe: whether Trump associates conspired with Russia and whether President Trump obstructed justice. Whitaker did not call for Mueller\u2019s dismissal in appearances reviewed by The Washington Post, but said it is within Trump\u2019s authority to fire him. (\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t and he shouldn\u2019t, but he can.\u201d)\n\nIn a six-month span in 2017, Whitaker regularly returned to a series of talking points: There was no collusion, collusion is not a crime, there was no obstruction of justice and there was no need to appoint a special counsel in the first place. It was this repeated skepticism of the Mueller probe that reportedly put Whitaker on Trump\u2019s radar.\n\n\u201cThe left is trying to sow this theory that essentially Russians interfered with the U.S. election, which has been proven false,\u201d Whitaker said on the Chosen Generation Radio Show in March 2017. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to suggest that essentially the Trump campaign had these deep ties into Russia, which is not true. \u2026 [and] that somehow Russia and the Trump campaign sort of conspired to influence the election. I mean, it\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only difference between this current investigation and \u2018Watergate\u2019 is \u2018Watergate\u2019 actually had evidence of real crimes being committed,\u201d Whitaker said on CNN in June 2017. \u201cRight now we have two acts by a president that appear to be constitutionally lawful and without more \u2014 for example, bribery or some other illegal act \u2014 I just don\u2019t see, as we sit here today, any evidence of crimes being committed.\u201d\n\nIn July 2017, Whitaker floated the idea of defunding the Mueller probe. In August 2017, Whitaker said it would cross a \u201cred line\u201d for Mueller to investigate the finances of the Trump Organization. And later that month, Whitaker said it was \u201cridiculous\u201d that Rosenstein appointed Mueller, as opposed to running the Russia investigation through regular Justice Department coursework.\n\nWhitaker, who in 2016 called for a special counsel investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server before an FBI investigation was complete, was more tepid last year about asserting wrongdoing in the Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cWhat we know publicly, there is not enough for a case,\u201d Whitaker said last June.\n\nBy the end of the summer, Whitaker started directly citing Trump\u2019s attacks on the probe in his appearances.\n\n\u201cThere was an interesting comment yesterday from the president on this investigation, and that is, \u2018Why don\u2019t these folks hurry up?\u2019\u201d Whitaker said in August 2017. \u201cIt is not helping this administration and really not helping the federal government generally to have the president and his associates under the cloud of a federal investigation.\u201d", "Reporter\n\n(Update: Adding a response from Ravitch/Burris)\n\nI recently published a post by Diane Ravitch and Carol Burris titled \u201cWhy It Matters Who Governs America\u2019s Public Schools,\u201d which took issue with some parts of a new report \u2014 \u201cThe Tapestry of American Public Education: How Can We Create a System of Schools Worth Choosing for All?\u201d \u2014 released by a California think tank founded by education expert Linda Darling-Hammond. This post is a response from Darling-Hammond and colleagues to that piece.\n\n[Why it matters who governs America\u2019s public schools]\n\nRavitch, Darling-Hammond and Burris are three of the most prominent voices in the national education debate about how to create equitable schools in this country and more often than not agree with one another. This piece and the earlier one reveal a split in the way they view school choice.\n\nRavitch, a former U.S. assistant secretary of education, is an education historian and advocate who for years was seen as the titular leader of the grass-roots movement against corporate school reform. Burris is a former award-winning high school principal in New York. Both women are leaders of the nonprofit advocacy group the Network for Public Education.\n\nRavitch and Burris oppose the expansion of alternatives to publicly funded and publicly operated schools and districts, including charter schools, which are privately operated but funded with taxpayer dollars. Their piece criticized the new report for, among other things, failing to take a strong stand on the expansion of charter schools.\n\nDarling-Hammond, an expert on teacher preparation and equity, founded the Center for Opportunity Policy in Education at Stanford University, where she is professor emeritus, and is founder and president of the California-based Learning Policy Institute. The nonprofit think tank was created to conduct independent, high-quality research to improve education policy and practice, and it was the institute that released the report.\n\nAs the post below explains, the report looks at the issue of school choice in a different way than many of the debates on the subject, and in contrast to Ravitch and Burris. You can read their initial piece here. After the following post is a response from them.\n\nBy Linda Darling-Hammond, Peter Cookson, Bob Rothman and Patrick Shields\n\nLast week, the Learning Policy Institute (LPI) released a report, \u201cThe Tapestry of American Public Education: How Can We Create a System of Schools Worth Choosing for All?\u201d that takes up the issues of choice in public education from a different perspective from the one that has been driving debates since the election of President Trump.\n\nTrump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos have made \u201cchoice\u201d their central education policy \u2014 defining it primarily as vouchers and tax credits for private schools and funding for charter schools, which include for-profit as well as nonprofit entities. DeVos has actually been a shareholder in K12 Inc., one of the largest for-profit charter chains, and was substantially responsible for designing charter policies in Michigan, where 79 percent of all charters are for-profit.\n\nYet, as we point out in our report, the vast majority of schools of choice in the United States are operated by public school districts which have used open enrollment plans (found in 25 states), magnet schools (found in 34 states), theme schools (think of the New York City school that long-ago inspired the TV series \u201cFame\u201d), and other innovative models long before charters were invented.\n\nThese choice plans have been used to support desegregation, to create options that meet student needs and interests, and to improve student success. Furthermore, of the 37 percent of public school parents who report they have public school options available to them, three quarters select their neighborhood public school as their first choice \u2014 a critical option in and of itself.\n\nOf these families, which represent 18 million students, only about 2.7 million choose charter schools. About the same number (2.6 million) choose magnet schools run by their own or other nearby school districts, and the remainder choose inter-district transfers \u2014 often designed to promote integration \u2014 or live in districts that have made all of their district-run schools open to choice. Districts such as Cambridge, Mass.; New York City; San Francisco; and many others allow parents to choose among schools in controlled choice plans that also seek to support integration and ongoing school improvement.\n\nThese districts and others have developed a tapestry of choices that provide school models such as math and science academies, career academies in fields ranging from health sciences to the arts, schools focused on community service and social justice, international schools focused on global issues and world languages, and schools designed for new English learners. Districts developing choices have sometimes brought long-standing internationally known models of education, such as Montessori, Waldorf and International Baccalaureate programs, into their schools.\n\nNetworks of schools with distinctive designs, such as New Tech High schools, Expeditionary Learning schools, and Internationals High Schools work with many districts across multiple states to support options that serve their students. Many of these distinctive school models have been found to support stronger achievement for students. Magnet schools that are designed to enhance integration have also been found to have positive effects on achievement, graduation rates, student motivation and satisfaction with school.\n\nThus, choice and innovation are not concepts unique to private providers of education, but are and have been part of healthy public school systems for many decades. However, the outcomes of choice depend on how it is designed. Districts must struggle with how to provide successful schools for all students; how to ensure that choices do not lead to winners and losers; and how to ensure that choices do not lead to greater segregation of students by race, ethnicity, economic background or measured abilities.\n\nThe major point in our recent report is that, while we all like choices, choice in education should not be an end in and of itself, but a means to a set of ends that are important in a democratic society: a quality education for every child, access for all children to excellent schools that meet their needs and settings that foster the integration of our diverse country. Useful systems of choice should improve student learning opportunities, strengthen educational attainment and prepare young people for their civic roles in a democracy.\n\nThe fact that choice does not guarantee quality should be clear each time we flick through hundreds of cable TV channels without finding a single good viewing option. In public education, this kind of choice is not an acceptable outcome. It is clear from our research that choice alone is no magic bullet. Simply creating options does not automatically result in greater access for all students to better schools \u2014 or to more equitable opportunities, stronger learning or greater integration.\n\nSchool choice is a means that can lead to different ends depending on how it is designed and managed. For example, while parental choice in education has been used to foster voluntary desegregation through magnet schools and transfer plans within and beyond district lines, it has also been used to maintain racial and ethnic segregation through vouchers for all-white segregation academies or so-called \u201cfreedom of choice\u201d plans.\n\nOpen enrollment plans, such as one in Minnesota that allows families to choose schools across district lines, produced gains in achievement, integration and intergroup relations when it was managed with these goals in mind but became more segregative when the law was changed to ignore these goals.\n\nSimilarly, while some excellent charter schools have been developed across the country, others do significantly less well than district schools serving similar students. Among charters launched between 2001 and 2015, 40 percent were later closed, leaving families in the lurch and frequently shuffling children from one failing school to another, causing them to fall further behind academically in the process.\n\nJust closing schools is not an adequate option for accountability, as it does not by itself ensure strong instruction for all children. Furthermore, research has found that, in unregulated settings, students with disabilities, English learners, and others with high levels of need are often kept out or pushed out of schools that end up choosing the students they will serve, rather than enabling students to choose the schools they want to attend and supporting the schools to serve them well. Virtual charters, most of which are for-profit, have strong negative effects on achievement almost everywhere and graduate fewer than half as many of their students as public schools generally.\n\nOur report notes that state accountability and governance play an important role in charter school quality. Massachusetts, which is among the highest-achieving states in the country, enables charters to operate under tight numerical caps and very strong accountability rules that ensure quality of staffing and curriculum, as well as equitable access and retention for students with special needs. For-profit charters are outlawed there.\n\nIn a recent commentary in this column, authors Diane Ravitch and Carol Burris erroneously asserted that our report aims to promote unbridled alternatives to publicly funded and publicly operated school districts. Quite the opposite is true.\n\nThe report aims to help states and districts consider how to manage the broad tapestry of choices available in public schools in ways that create quality schools with equitable access and integrative outcomes. Our analysis does not frame the problem as one of school choice versus no school choice, but as one concerned with what kind of school choice and to what ends. The report lays out the evidence and examples of how various systems have worked and can work to foster equitable access, strong student outcomes and diversity and inclusion.\n\nIt suggests that, to ensure equitable access, excellent student outcomes and diversity and inclusion, districts consider the following:\n\nFocus on educational opportunities for children, not governance structures for adults.\n\nIn some cities, such as Los Angeles and New Orleans, advocates have set goals for the expansion of charters to represent 50 percent or even 100 percent of all schools. This sets up debates focused on how many charters a district should have, rather than on how the district can best meet the needs of children. Decisions about system design should instead focus on creating high-quality learning environments for all children, for example, by looking at ways to expand oversubscribed and successful programs rather than rationing access, and to ensure supports for underserved groups, schools or neighborhoods, including community school models, more effective bilingual programs, greater training and recruitment of special education teachers, or investments in new curriculum or technology.\n\nWork to ensure equity and access for all.\n\nSimply opening up the \u201cmarket\u201d to parental choice tends to favor those families with the most social capital, rather than those whose children lack quality choices. Districts should proactively initiate efforts to ensure good schools in every neighborhood \u2014 with investments in high-quality personnel and programs \u2014 and develop the means to protect access for the full range of students to all schools.\n\nCreate transparency at every stage about outcomes, opportunities and resources.\n\nDistricts that maintain an array of quality school options provide parents, community members and policymakers with consistent, comparable and easily accessible information on all schools. Such information includes, among other things, admission processes, recruitment and retention outcomes, enrollment patterns, finances, access to high-quality curriculum and learning opportunities, and student outcomes, such as achievement and graduation, and disciplinary practices. As in New York City, these data should also include the results of school quality reviews that provide qualitative evidence about school practices, programs and climate that can guide continuous improvement and diagnostic investments.\n\nBuild a system of schools that meets all students\u2019 needs.\n\nFor a system to work effectively, all students need access to high-quality schools, and all schools must be of high quality. No neighborhood should lack an effective school for parents to choose. Creating such a system requires a laserlike focus on understanding student and school needs and then investing in program resources as well as teachers and leaders, individually and in professional learning networks, to build their capacities to create strong schools and serve all students. It also means investing in the wraparound services and supports that students need to be healthy and ready to learn each day, often provided by community schools that are anchors for education from pre-K to adult education and for health and mental health care, as well.\n\nThe issue of school choice is now embedded in public discourse as either a blessing or a curse. If we can move from polemics to evidence, and focus on approaches to serve all students, we can go about the business of building systems of public schools worth choosing, while bringing children together to build unity, rather than create division, in our nation.\n\n-0-0-0-\n\nHere is the original post by Diane Ravitch and Carol Burris, and following is a response to this post from them:\n\nWe agree on many issues with Linda Darling-Hammond and the Learning Policy Institute. Our goals are the same. We want excellent schools for all children. But we don\u2019t think that charter schools bring us closer to our shared goals.\n\nAs Darling-Hammond acknowledges, 40 percent of the charter schools that opened from 2001 TO 2015 have closed. Instability and churn do not provide a path to excellent schools for all. Darling-Hammond and her team believe the problems with charters are fixable. Given the charter sector\u2019s continual resistance to any real accountability, transparency or serious reform, we are doubtful. It has become increasingly apparent that the corruption, mismanagement and self-dealing by private management are not \u201cbugs,\u201d but rather features of the charter sector.\n\nWe also think that the LPI team underestimates the damage that privately managed charter schools do to public schools, by siphoning off the students they choose and diverting resources, causing budget cuts to the schools that most students choose.\n\nAs Jan Resseger a former chair of the National Council of Churches Committee on Public Education explains here, scholars including Gordon Lafer and Bruce Baker have demonstrated the inefficiency of dividing scarce public resources among multiple systems of schools.\n\nSome of the language we criticized in our prior blog has been deleted from the report, such as the word \u201cportfolio.\u201d We are grateful. Other language has been modified to soften the critique of those who are concerned about school governance, and language that we interpreted as opposition to caps has been clarified.\n\nWhat remains, however, is a perspective that is consonant with the portfolio model, that is, the belief that privately managed charters can be seamlessly folded into the public school system as one of many choices. Based on what we have reported about charters school scams, frauds, and cherry-picking of students, we remain skeptical.\n\nGiven Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019 love for charter schools, we continue to see private management of public dollars as privatization and to see privately managed (and unaccountable) charter schools not as public schools but as government contractors in serious need of regulation and oversight.", "FILE - In this Tuesday, Oct. 13, 2015 file photo, part of the reconstructed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 plane is seen prior to the Dutch Safety Board presents the board\u2019s final report into what caused Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 to break up high over Eastern Ukraine last year, killing all 298 people on board, during a press conference in Gilze-Rijen, central Netherlands.

Thanks for waking up with us and sign up here. See you on Monday.\n\nA few things broke overnight: In a major blow to the Trump administration, a federal judge blocked the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline \u2014 at least temporarily. And Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema took a slight lead over GOP Rep. Martha McSally in the Arizona Senate race after roughly 127,000 votes were tallied in Maricopa County. There are more votes outstanding. And Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told CNN she has \"total confidence\" confidence she'll be the new House speaker.\n\nOn The Hill\n\nON LOSING THE HOUSE: Power Up touched base yesterday with Matt Gorman, the communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee, to reflect on his party's loss of the House majority. The campaign veteran credited Democrats with recruiting candidates that appealed to suburban women and discussed how Democrats used Trump's \"barbell\" approval ratings to their advantage. The below conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nYou'll hear on Monday from his counterpart at the Democratic Congressional Committee, Meredith Kelly.\n\nQ: Why did Republicans lose the House and how do you come back? More specifically, why did women flee the party?\n\n\n\nA: Republicans faced a tough environment and historic head winds. We were very clear-eyed about what we faced \u2014 even in January 2017. We knew this was going to be a cycle where the Democratic base was chomping at the bit to avenge their 2016 loss. The gender gap was an absolute challenge for us. I think the Democrats recruited compelling candidates that appealed to suburban women. However, now the rubber meets the road since their rhetoric turns to a voting record.\n\n\n\nQ: Can you speak to the Trump effect on House races \u2014 where did his visits help and where did they hurt? What\u2019s the data on how the caravan messaging resonated with voters?\n\n\n\nA: President Trump\u2019s approval ratings looks like a barbell. A ton of people love him and a ton of people don\u2019t like him so much . . . What we learned in the specials is that we can use him to motivate our base. The people that don\u2019t like him were always going to come out. We needed to make sure those that loved him did, too. We used him in targeted robo-calls and in cities that galvanized our base.\n\nAnd immigration was always an issue for us. We ran ads on it in states far from the southern border, like Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and even Orange County, California, districts Hillary Clinton won.\n\n\n\nQ: Seems like the midterms laid bare the urban-rural divide. Do you see this as a problem for House Republicans going forward?\n\n\n\nA: I\u2019m skeptical about drawing too many conclusions from one bad election cycle. It seems to be an annual rite of passage to see an elephant or a donkey on the cover of TIME magazine proclaiming the party dead. It\u2019s clear, however, that voters are self-sorting in ways unlike ever before. Republicans live near other Republicans and Democrats live near other Democrats.\n\n\n\nQ: On losing ground in the Midwest, where Trump had converted many lifelong Democrats: will those voters return to Republicans and can they win again across the Midwest?\n\n\n\nA: It\u2019s important to remember this next election will be a choice: President Trump versus what\u2019s likely to be a very liberal Democrat. Much like the contrast between Trump and Hillary helped us in the Midwest in 2016, the contrast between a Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders or Michael Avenatti (lol) will give voters a very clear choice.\n\n\n\nQ: When Democrats were walloped in the 2010 (and subsequent) midterms, many promising party upstarts lost their seats and the Democrats' bench really suffered. Are you worried about the same effect on Republicans?\n\n\n\nA: It wasn\u2019t just 2010 that crushed the Democrats\u2019 bench. It was the systematic indifference President Obama gave to actually building the Democratic Party. The losses sustained by Democrats at the state level happened over the course of six to eight years \u2014 in spite of the fact they were still winning Senate and House races and governorships up-and-down the ballot. Losing the House does not beget a weak bench.\n\n\n\nQ: How do you think anti-gerrymandering measures and Democratic wins in statehouses will affect redistricting in the years ahead?\n\n\n\nA: Redistricting will be a major issue coming up. Democrats finally understand the stakes. And they\u2019ve actually taken it too far. What they did in Pennsylvania earlier this year redrawing the congressional lines was an absolute abomination. A partisan Supreme Court \u2014 who ran on this issue \u2014 drew the lines and changed the fortunes of Republicans in that state overnight. Republicans will fight.

Cruz ultimately beat O\u2019Rourke by three points.\n\nBad blood: Trump\u2019s visit re-injected long-simmering tensions between the president and Cruz into the media bloodstream.

Trump is not slated to join.\n\nT\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate: The Post\u2019s David Nakamura reports Macron and Trump will meet Saturday \u201cto discuss areas of tension, including Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw . . . from the Iran nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions on Tehran, as well as the security situation in Syria and, potentially, trade relations \u2026 the president has no other bilateral meetings scheduled, though he could speak informally with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin during a luncheon, aides said, mostly aimed at setting up a formal meeting at the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires this month.\u201d\n\nHistory lesson?: Observers said the setting, designed to commemorate those who perished in WWI might resonate with the president. \u201cThe losses were extraordinary. We witnessed some of the most horrific scenes that we\u2019ve understood and the terrible cost that comes with that \u2026 it\u2019s a reminder of what happens when society breaks down into conflict,\u201d Heather Conley, a senior vice president of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, told Power Up.\n\nLimits: Macron's approach to appealing to the francophile in Trump seems to have its limits. A year-and-a-half into their relationship, not even fancy dinners at the Eiffel tower has bridged their policy differences.\n\nTampa Bay Times\n\nIn the Media\n\nHOMETOWN HEADLINES: While the national media counted midterm results as either wins or losses for the parties, it was easy to lose sight of the real-life implications for the local people and places. Here\u2019s how local newspapers in five states covered their most important races:\n\nFlorida : A banner headline in Wednesday\u2019s Tampa Bay Times captured a typical Florida Election Day mood, pronouncing the state\u2019s gubernatorial contest \u201cANOTHER NAIL-BITER.\u201d The accompanying story took stock of the loss on the left that is \u201csure to leave Democrats shattered.\u201d Among the consequences: \u201cGov.-Elect [Ron] DeSantis also will appoint three state Supreme Court justices and shift the court rightward for a generation.\u201d\n\nGeorgia: The double-decker headline in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Thursday made clear that, even two days after the election, the dust still hadn\u2019t settled in Georgia: \u201cKEMP CLAIMS VICTORY; ABRAMS PRESSES ON.\u201d Beneath that, though, the paper examined the question of why \u201chundreds of voting machines sat unused, locked up in government warehouses,\u201d as voters waited in hours-long lines across the state.\n\nThe Forum of Fargo-Moorhead\n\nNorth Dakota: On the day after the midterms, The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead devoted the top half of its front page to a photo of [Sen. Heidi] Heitkamp hugging her husband during her concession speech. The next day, two maps showing how the state\u2019s counties voted in 2012 (when Heitkamp was first elected) and in 2018 displayed the state's rightward lurch, with GOP support holding strong in the westernmost parts of the state and spreading east, all the way to two of its last blue outposts, Grand Forks and Fargo, on the Minnesota line.\n\nOhio: The Cincinnati Enquirer examined its state\u2019s future on A1 Thursday, using an honorific that\u2019s sure to please Republicans everywhere: \u201cRed Ohio stays in GOP hands the next 4 years.\u201d The story began, \u201cForget about a blue wave. In midterm elections, Ohio is a red state,\u201d citing Republican gubernatorial candidate Mike DeWine\u2019s win and more: \u201cRepublicans swept the four down-ticket races. The GOP is expected to retain a veto-proof majority in the state Legislature.\u201d\n\nTexas: Two days after the results, the Austin American Statesman ran a map on its front page with a county-by-county vote breakdown. The accompanying story invoked the Old Testament to describe the race\u2019s implications for Democrats there: \u201c[O\u2019Rourke] didn\u2019t make it to the promised land in his bid to unseat [Cruz] . . . but he did lead Texas Democrats to the Red Sea where they could witness the waters begin to part.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nOutside the Beltway\n\n'LIKE HELL': That's how Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean described the scene of the massacre at a Thousand Oaks, Calif. bar Wednesday night. A gunman entered a popular nightspot in the southern California city and fired seemingly at random, killing 12 people, including a sheriff's deputy who raced inside the bar to confront the attacker. It was the latest in a string of horrific mass shootings claiming the lives of more than 1,000 people.

(Markus Schreiber/Associated Press)\n\nBERLIN \u2014 Chancellor Angela Merkel and Germany\u2019s main Jewish leader warned against tolerating modern-day anti-Semitism and racism as they marked the 80th anniversary Friday of the Nazis\u2019 anti-Jewish Kristallnacht, or \u201cNight of Broken Glass,\u201d pogrom.\n\nOn Nov. 9, 1938, Jews were terrorized throughout Germany and Austria. At least 91 people were killed, hundreds of synagogues burned down, some 7,500 Jewish businesses vandalized, and up to 30,000 Jewish men arrested, many of whom were taken away to concentration camps.\n\nTwenty years after Germany\u2019s defeat in World War I and 5\u00bd years after Adolf Hitler took power, state-driven anti-Semitism \u201cmade it possible for many Germans to live out long-held resentments, to live out hatred and violence,\u201d Merkel said. \u201cWith the November pogrom, the road to the Holocaust was mapped out.\u201d\n\nMerkel spoke in a ceremony at a Berlin synagogue. The head of Germany\u2019s Central Council of Jews, Josef Schuster, said the building was set alight in 1938 and the blaze extinguished relatively quickly only so as not to endanger neighboring houses.\n\nSchuster said that, while the Nazis\u2019 SA and SS organizations were responsible for the pogrom, that already meant thousands of Germans took part \u2014 and the population\u2019s reaction \u201cgave the Nazis valuable information: barely anyone protested.\u201d\n\nHe added that, while modern-day attacks on Jews, migrants and Muslims can\u2019t be equated with the crimes of the Nazi era, \u201cI see it as a disgrace for our country that such things happen in Germany in 2018.\u201d\n\nHe assailed the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which he said has \u201crespect for nothing\u201d and which his organization didn\u2019t invite to Friday\u2019s event. The party entered Germany\u2019s parliament last year.\n\n\u201cToday, we are living once again in a time of far-reaching change,\u201d Merkel said. \u201cIn such times, there is always a particularly great danger of those who react with supposedly simple answers gaining support.\u201d\n\nThose answers, she said, are too often accompanied by a \u201cbrutalization of language.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are commemorating today with the promise that we will set ourselves strongly against attacks on our open and plural society,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are commemorating in the knowledge that watching as lines are crossed and crimes are committed ultimately means going along with them.\u201d\n\nIn a separate speech to parliament on a day that also marked the 100th anniversary of the proclamation of a German republic after World War I and the 29th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier urged his compatriots to embrace an enlightened, \u201cdemocratic patriotism\u201d and reject aggressive nationalism that romanticizes the country\u2019s history.\n\nEvidence from post-war trials of perpetrators, such as one involving the Bavarian town of Treuchtlingen, shows that many ordinary Germans joined in the 1938 pogrom, some out of anti-Semitism, others using the riots as opportunities to settle personal grudges or to enrich themselves.\n\nThe Treuchtlingen case was one of the first and among the largest of more than 1,000 post-war Kristallnacht trials in West German courts. A report by the U.S. military\u2019s Counter Intelligence Corps, which sent an observer to the 1946 proceedings, provides details about the nearly 60 defendants.\n\nThe report from CIC special agent Erich Bendfeldt was declassified this year by the U.S. National Archives in response to an Associated Press Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nIt shows that the Treuchtlingen synagogue was burned that night to the foundation walls. The fire department hosed down neighboring \u201cAryan-owned\u201d buildings to protect them, while people rampaged through the town, mobbing Jewish homes, destroying property and looting.\n\nOne middle-aged woman swung by the home of a Jewish family she owed money to and destroyed the ledgers, and also had enough time to bring gasoline to help torch the synagogue.\n\nThe town\u2019s mayor took personal command of much of the destruction, while himself beating a respected Jewish doctor nearly to death. A 29-year-old engine driver also beat the doctor, poured a chamber pot over the head of a Jewish girl and forced her father at dagger-point to say \u201cHeil Hitler.\u201d\n\n___\n\nHerschaft contributed reporting from New York.

Addressing reporters in Tallahassee on Thursday night, Scott (R) declared that he was suing to stop Democrats from stealing what he said was his midterm victory over incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. His ire in particular zeroed in on two South Florida counties.\n\n\u201cEvery Floridian should be concerned there may be rampant fraud happening in Palm Beach and Broward counties,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI will not sit idly by while unethical liberals try to steal this election from the people of Florida.\u201d\n\nBack in Washington, President Trump echoed the allegation. \u201cLaw Enforcement is looking into another big corruption scandal having to do with Election Fraud in #Broward and Palm Beach. Florida voted for Rick Scott!\u201d the president blasted out on Twitter.\n\nLate Friday morning, as he was leaving the White House for a trip to Paris to mark the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended of World War I, Trump told reporters that Broward County and the woman in charge of elections there have \u201ca horrible history.\u201d He went on: \u201cAnd all of a sudden they\u2019re finding votes out of nowhere. Rick Scott ... won by a comfortable margin, but every couple of hours it does down a little bit.... Bad things have gone on in Broward County, really bad things.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have piled on about alleged ballot-box shenanigans and dirty tricks, layering the aftermath of a contentious election with new drama.\n\nBut the whole situation in Florida also feels like a repeat of past political upheaval. That\u2019s thanks to Broward County.\n\nFor decades, the county has regularly been a hot zone for election-night chaos in both statewide and national races, including the infamous 2000 presidential election. Years of problems have only slapped additional coats of paint on the county\u2019s sordid reputation as a black hole for ballots. Broward County Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes, the target of Scott\u2019s legal action, has been accused in recent years of illegally destroying ballots and mismanagement.\n\nAs The Washington Post reported Thursday, Florida election officials have until Saturday to tally votes to determine whether both the Senate and gubernatorial races will head to a recount. But Snipes on Thursday fueled the latest Broward controversy \u2014 and conspiracy theories \u2014 when she failed to explain how long her office\u2019s count would take.\n\n\u201cThe #Broward Elections Supervisor has been pulling stunts like this for years and we\u2019re not going to let her get away with it,\u201d GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted Thursday. \u201c#Broward election supervisors ongoing violation of #Florida law requiring timely reporting isn\u2019t just annoying incompetence,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on Twitter. \u201cIt has opened the door for lawyers to come here & try to steal a seat in the U.S. Senate & Florida Cabinet.\u201d\n\nSnipes has yet to comment on Scott\u2019s legal threats.\n\nBut the criticism also is politically tinged. Broward is Florida\u2019s biggest Democratic stronghold, meaning the county is a convenient punching bag for Florida\u2019s GOP as well as outsider candidates hoping to take on the mainstream Democratic Party. And with the country\u2019s election process again under siege, Broward\u2019s track record is once more of national significance.\n\n\u201cThey are the Keystone Kops of elections,\u201d a conservative election attorney told Politico in 2017. \u201cIt\u2019s complete incompetence.\u201d\n\n\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott takes to the stage during his election night party at the LaPlaya Beach & Golf Resort. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nSandwiched between Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties, rubbing up against the Atlantic Ocean and the Everglades, Broward is 1,323 square miles of interlocking suburbs as well as the city of Fort Lauderdale. According to Snipes\u2019s office, the county is home to approximately 593,000 registered Democrats and 252,000 registered Republicans. The balance makes Broward particularly significant in the tight, high-wire races that have come to define the state.\n\nThe grand tour of Broward\u2019s ballot problems starts with the most controversial presidential election of recent memory. After the close finish between George W. Bush and Al Gore, reports emerged of partially punched paper ballots that may have been improperly disqualified \u2014 known forevermore as \u201changing chads.\u201d The Gore campaign pushed for manual recounts in four Florida counties \u2014 Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, Volusia and Broward.\n\nFor 36 days after the election, more than 45 lawsuits shuttled through state and federal courts over the election results. The uncertainty ended when the U.S. Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore halted a recount of ballots, including Broward\u2019s, preserving Bush\u2019s slim win.\n\nProblems continued to plague Broward. In 2001, Miriam Oliphant won a race for the county\u2019s elections supervisor. According to a report in City Link, her tenure was marked by cronyism and excessive spending. Because of poor planning, a September 2002 primary started with 25 Broward precincts opening late. Workers failed to show. Machines broke. Hundreds of uncounted ballots were later discovered.\n\nA year later during municipal elections, \u201cmore mail-in ballots \u2014 17,245 \u2014 were returned as undeliverable than were cast\u201d because of Oliphant\u2019s mismanagement of her office, City Link reported. That same month, then-Gov. Jeb Bush (R) removed Oliphant from office and appointed Snipes to the position.\n\nBut Broward\u2019s troubles continued.\n\nAs The Washington Post reported going into the 2004 presidential election, Florida was once again expected to be a decisive swing state. As Election Day approached, Snipes blamed the U.S. Postal Service for losing 58,000 absentee ballots, then later announced that only 6,000 ballots had disappeared. Postal officials claimed they had done nothing wrong. Then, Snipes\u2019s office dropped 2,400 absentee ballots off at the post office on a Saturday before the election, after mail carriers were already gone for the day.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way in hell those people are going to get their ballots in a timely fashion,\u201d a Postal Service spokesman told The Post, laying blame on Broward. \u201cThey should get their act together over there.\u201d\n\nThe disorganization meant potential absentee Broward voters \u2014 a critical constituency for Democratic candidate John F. Kerry \u2014 were out of luck. \u201cI feel like I live in a Third World country,\u201d one frustrated Broward voter told The Post.\n\nRecent years have seen more blunders as well as legal action targeting the county.\n\nIn 2016, Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz faced a primary challenge by a Bernie Sanders-backed candidate named Tim Canova in Florida\u2019s 23rd District. Canova sued Broward elections officials and asked to inspect the physical ballots in the race. As Politico reported, Snipes\u2019s office destroyed the physical originals while saving digital copies as the lawsuit was pending \u2014 a violation of a federal statute requiring congressional ballots be saved for 22 months after an election.\n\nSnipes later called the decision a mistake. As a result, the state announced it would be monitoring Broward\u2019s 2018 elections.\n\nAdditional lawsuits stemming from 2016 were also launched against the office. A number of absentee ballots sent out that cycle from Broward were missing a medical marijuana amendment. Attorneys from the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws sued the county. According to the Miami Herald, a judge eventually ruled in favor of Broward.\n\nThe Republican Party also sued Broward over how the county opened absentee ballots after observing officials at work in 2016. In August, a judge ruled that Broward officials could no longer open the ballots in secret or before a three-member board decided on their validity, Politico reported.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost much faith and confidence in the Broward Supervisor of Elections Office to conduct a fair election,\u201d Canova, now a vocal critic of the county after also failing in a 2018 third-party bid for Wasserman Schultz\u2019s seat, told a group of voters in September. \u201cIt\u2019s undermined my confidence in the election system generally around this country.\u201d\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nThousand Oaks parents: \u2018I don\u2019t want prayers.

News of the two children\u2019s killing came out after the hostages arrived in Sweida.\n\nOne woman had earlier died in custody and another was shot dead by the extremists as they pressed for demands. In August, a 19-year-old man was also killed in detention.\n\nSix other hostages, two women and four children, were freed in an exchange with the government in October. Negotiations were expected to free the remaining hostages but the talks failed and Syrian troops launched a broad offensive against IS in southern Syria.\n\nThe rare attacks in the province, populated mainly by Syria\u2019s minority Druze, had included several suicide bombings by the extremists, which devastated the community and shattered the region\u2019s calm.\n\nNashaat Abu Ammar, Najwa\u2019s husband, said his 8-year-old son Raafat was shot dead by the extremists during the Syrian army raid to free the hostages.\n\n\u201cThey shot him in his mother\u2019s lap,\u201d Abu Ammar told The Associated Press by phone from Sweida, his voice cracking with emotion.\n\nHe only learned of his son\u2019s killing after the former hostages arrived in Sweida.\n\nOnly hours before, Abu Ammar had told the AP: \u201cMy happiness is huge.\u201d\n\nHis joy was crushed hours later when the hostages arrived in Sweida. Among them was the body of Raafat and his 13-year-old cousin. His wife appeared very frail, he said, as the hostages were barely being fed.\n\n\u201cSometimes they fed us once every two days and other times twice every day,\u201d Najwa said, adding that it was mostly just olive oil, thyme and jam.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t torture us but they insulted the children and beat them,\u201d she said, speaking after returning to her home in the village, Shibki. \u201cThen they started threatening to kill us.\u201d\n\nShe said they didn\u2019t know of the killed hostages until they were liberated.\n\n\u201cThey held us first in a camp then a cave and kept moving us from one place to the other,\u201d she said. \u201cAt one point we were in a car for 12 hours and we didn\u2019t know where we were heading.\u201d\n\nShe was liberated shortly before noon Thursday with the others at a heel of a desert valley in central Syria.\n\nRussian Lt.

George Lawrence Price, center, at the St. Symphorien Cemetery near Mons, Belgium. Price was the last Canadian soldier to die on the Western Front during the First World War. (Virginia Mayo, File/Associated Press)\n\nSAINT-SYMPHORIEN, Belgium \u2014 With the clock ticking down to mere seconds in a four-year conflict that had already killed millions, the folly of death and destruction in World War I became ever more incomprehensible. Yet, even then it could not be stopped.\n\nWith both sides in the war already knowing for hours a cease-fire would start at 11 a.m. on the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, hundreds of good men kept falling that morning.\n\nFear the other side would not abide by the conditions of the armistice, a sheer hatred produced by four years of unprecedented slaughter, blind ambition of commanders who craved that last victory, the inane joy of killing, reason enough not to let humanity shine through a few minutes, hours early. Put together they trumped the lives of soldiers, many of whom were convinced they were on the brink of peace and survival.\n\nWith two minutes to go, Canadian Private George Lawrence Price was shot by a German sniper close to Mons in southern Belgium. Another life shattered in its prime at 25.\n\nSome 250 kilometers (150 miles) away on the Western Front in France, an American soldier Henry Gunther, for reasons still hard to explain a century later, stormed a German post with only one minute left before the armistice and was mowed down by machine gun fire. He was 23.\n\n\u201cGunther\u2019s act is seen as almost a symbol of the futility of the larger war,\u201d said U.S. historian Alec Bennett. \u201cHe was the last American. I believe he may have been the last soldier on any side to die in World War I.\u201d\n\nAny soldier who died that morning might well be an equal symbol of futility, and the mark of \u201cNov. 11, 1918\u201d on any headstone at a World War I cemetery makes it especially poignant.\n\n\u201cIt was a matter of minutes,\u201d said Corentin Rousman, a Belgian historian working in Mons, where British empire soldiers had their first battle with the Germans in August 1914, and also their last over four years later, when Price perished.\n\nFor Commonwealth commanders it must have been especially sweet to retake the city, bringing the war to a full circle right where they lost their first soldier, English Private John Parr who had stumbled onto the Germans on Aug. 21, 1914.\n\nIn between, World War I had claimed some 14 million lives, including 9 million soldiers, sailors and airmen from 28 countries. Early on, Germany came close to a quick victory before the conflict settled into hellish trench warfare. One battle, like the Somme in France could have up to a million casualties. Poison gas came to epitomize the cruel ruthlessness of a war the likes of which history had never seen.\n\nWhen the old European powers were close to exhaustion in the war of attrition it came to fewer nations like Gunther\u2019s United States and Price\u2019s Canada to make the difference.\n\nPrice had been a farm laborer in Saskatchewan when the swirl of history picked him off the land in 1917 as the allies sought ever more manpower to keep the Germans at bay on the Western Front.\n\nThe following summer he was part of the allied surge, and despite being gassed, he took city upon village upon city \u2014 right up to the morning of Nov. 11.\n\nNews of the impending cease-fire was already known, still he decided to go check out some homes along the historic network of industrial canals while in the center of Mons citizens already broke out the wine and whisky they had hidden for years to celebrate the liberation of their ancient medieval city.\n\n\u201cThen it is unclear what happens,\u201d said Rousman. Either Price runs out of a home to help someone or he thinks the war is over. What happened instead was that a shot rang out across a canal and Price dropped.\n\n\u201cThere no longer was any massive artillery around. It really was one man, here and there, who was driven by vengeance, by a need to kill one last time,\u201d Rousman said.\n\nAnd minutes not only counted for the dead but also for the killers.\n\n\u201cThere are rules in war,\u201d Rousman said. \u201cThere is always the possibility to kill two minutes before a cease-fire. Two minutes after, the German would have had to stand before a judge. That\u2019s the difference.\u201d\n\nThe soldier who shot Price was never identified, swallowed up in a German retreat.\n\nIn senseless death, Price made the war come full circle at the level of soldiers.\n\nWith leaves falling on Saint Symphorien cemetery just outside Mons, Price, the last Commonwealth victim killed in the war, lies within a stone\u2019s throw from Parr, the first one.\n\n\u201cHe is not forgotten,\u201d said Rousman. \u201cIt\u2019s a soldier whose tomb is often draped in flowers, notes and Canadian flags.\u201d\n\n___\n\nExcerpt from \u201cWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition,\u201d available at Amazon https://amzn.to/2JGrx5U\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

One grave holds the remains of Pvt. John Parr, killed Aug. 21, 1914. The other grave is of Pvt. George Ellison, who survived some of the war\u2019s worst battles but was shot on Nov. 11, 1918 \u2014 the war\u2019s last day.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron continued his pilgrimage of WWI sites and caught up with May, as the two present day leaders of the Allied forces that defeated Germany walked past graves at the Thiepval memorial.\n\n\u201cEach cemetery and memorial across the world is a unique and poignant reminder of the cost of the First World War,\u201d said May.\n\nSixty-nine heads of state and government will underscore that message at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Paris on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month on Sunday, exactly a century after the armistice.\n\nSuch was the symbolic importance of the French capital that victorious U.S. Gen.

(JEROME FAVRE/EPA-EFE/SHUTTERSTOCK)\n\nYears ago, the question of whether a writer critical of the Beijing government could speak publicly at a literary festival would be considered moot in this city, one of Asia\u2019s premier political havens.\n\nThis week, however, a days-long drama surrounding British Chinese writer Ma Jian only added to a growing sense that the old Hong Kong \u2014 and the freedoms once enjoyed here \u2014 are fading fast.\n\nThe controversy began Thursday when the Tai Kwun Center for Heritage and Arts, a prominent cultural institution, abruptly announced it would cancel two Hong Kong International Literary Festival events planned for Ma \u2014 whose works have long been banned in mainland China \u2014 because the center did not want to provide a platform for \u201cpolitical interests.\u201d\n\nTai Kwun, a government-backed institution, ultimately reversed its decision less than 24 hours before Ma was to speak, but not before its earlier cancellation had prompted an outcry and an unsuccessful effort by festival organizers to find another venue willing to host him.\n\nMa is the latest dissident to recently encounter hurdles in Hong Kong. Last week, a cartoonist canceled a solo exhibition following what he said were threats from mainland authorities. And on Thursday, Hong Kong immigration officials denied entry to Financial Times journalist Victor Mallet, whom it had expelled in an unprecedented move a month earlier.\n\nTaken together, the incidents have reinforced concerns by pro-democracy activists, human rights observers and Western diplomats that Hong Kong\u2019s status as a free-speech haven is swiftly eroding, either under direct pressure from Beijing or from the subtler effects of self-censorship.\n\nMa, 65, has been a thorn in Beijing\u2019s side for decades. He recently published a new novel in Britain, \u201cChina Dream,\u201d excoriating Chinese totalitarianism and President Xi Jinping\u2019s vision for national greatness.\n\nSpeaking by telephone before departing London, Ma, 65, said he was puzzled by the last-minute uncertainty over his engagements, given that the festival\u2019s agenda \u2014 and the rooms he was scheduled to speak in \u2014 had long been decided.\n\nMa said he was determined to fly to Hong Kong to find out if he could enter the territory at all and, if he could, demand an explanation.\n\n\u201cI want to know if this was an instance of self-censorship, or if there were greater political forces at play,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to know the truth.\u201d\n\nTai Kwun said late Friday that it would host Ma after all because festival organizers could not find an alternate venue. The center\u2019s director, Timothy Calnin, had said earlier that Tai Kwun did not want to \u201cpromote the political interests of any individual.\u201d\n\n[Believe in the motherland, China tells Hong Kong \u2014 and respect its might]\n\nHong Kong was guaranteed a degree of political autonomy and freedom as part of a 1997 hand\u00adover agreement between China and Britain that ended British colonial rule in the territory. But Chinese authorities, deeply alarmed by the eruption of pro-democracy protests in 2014 known as \u201cthe Umbrella Movement,\u201d have tried to instill a sense of patriotism and have tightened political controls in ways large and small.\n\n\n\nActivists hold a demonstration outside the government headquarters in Hong Kong in September to mark the fourth anniversary of the mass pro-democracy rallies known as \u201cthe Umbrella Movement.\u201d (Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nHong Kong leaders, who answer ultimately to Beijing, have taken steps to block opposition candidates from assuming office in recent years, banned a pro-independence political party outright this summer and have taken a markedly tougher line against separatist advocacy. This month, prosecutors are set to try nine leaders of the 2014 protests on \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d charges.\n\nMedia organizations, business groups and Western governments were taken aback in October when Hong Kong expelled Mallet of the Financial Times, who had hosted a talk at the Foreign \u00adCorrespondents Club with pro-independence activist Andy Chan despite demands by Hong Kong and Beijing officials to call off the event.\n\nMallet left Hong Kong last month, and he was questioned by immigration officials for hours Thursday when he sought to re\u00adenter as a tourist. He was eventually denied entry, the FT said Friday.\n\nIn an emailed statement, a British consulate-general spokesman said the Foreign Office was \u201cvery concerned by the authorities\u2019 unprecedented rejection of a visa for a senior British journalist, which undermines Hong Kong\u2019s freedom of speech and freedom of the press.\u201d\n\nMark Field, Britain\u2019s minister of state for Asia, was in Hong Kong this week and would raise Mallet\u2019s case with local authorities \u201cas a matter of urgency,\u201d the statement added.\n\nPolitical observers in Hong Kong say that although the government never acknowledged that Mallet\u2019s ejection was retribution for hosting the talk with Chan \u2014 whom a former Hong Kong leader equated with a criminal \u2014 it sent a clear message to all businesses and institutions to step back from controversial activities.\n\n\u201cThis is exactly how censorship and self-censorship foster each other,\u201d said Maya Wang, China researcher for Human Rights Watch. \u201cEveryone collectively moves back, far behind the red line, out of a sense of self-preservation.\u201d\n\nAfter several Hong Kong booksellers were widely believed to have been abducted by Chinese security agents in 2016, the city\u2019s freewheeling political publishing industry similarly withered, as stores voluntarily folded and writers shied away from digging into Chinese politics.\n\nMa, the British novelist, said on Twitter last week that he has not been able to find a Hong Kong publisher for \u201cChina Dream\u201d because they were \u201ctoo afraid.\u201d Publishers in Hong Kong, he told local media, insisted that he rename a character he had called \u201cXi Jinping.\u201d\n\nPenguin, his British publisher, has been bolder, describing Ma\u2019s new novel on its website as \u201can arrow at President Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018China Dream\u2019 propaganda\u201d and \u201ca biting satire of totalitarianism.\u201d\n\nMa, who published a book early in his career about Tibet \u2014 another third rail of Chinese politics \u2014 remains persona non grata in the country of his birth and has not been back in decades. He was denied entry when he last attempted to cross the southern border from Hong Kong in 2011.\n\nHe lived for years in Hong Kong, where he holds permanent residency. He moved to Britain in 1997 when the territory was handed back to China.\n\n\u201cAfter 1997, I thought Hong Kong would have at least another 50 years of freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not expect intellectual censorship to grow step by step this bad, this fast.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nHong Kong, in a rare move, rejects the visa renewal for a Financial Times journalist\n\nHong Kong\u2019s government tries to make an example of small political party\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "JAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Two Papuan independence fighters and a third person have been killed during a week of gunbattles with security forces in the highlands of Indonesia\u2019s remote Papua region, both sides in the conflict say.\n\nAn Indonesian police and military operation is trying to capture Purom Wenda, a West Papua Liberation Army commander who has eluded Indonesia for 15 years but who authorities call a former petty criminal of \u201clow intellectual level.\u201d Villagers have fled into the jungle because of the fighting, which reports say has intensified in highlands districts for several months.\n\nWenda, in a statement conveyed via an activist on Friday, said two of his fighters were killed in a shootout with police and soldiers in mountainous Lanny Jaya district after his group shot dead a motorbike taxi driver they believed was spying for Indonesian security forces.\n\nThe military said the man, a migrant from Sulawesi, was an innocent civilian.\n\nAn insurgency has simmered in the formerly Dutch-controlled Papua region since it became part of Indonesia more than half a century ago.\n\n\u201cOur struggle in the jungle has been going for decades,\u201d said Wenda\u2019s statement. \u201cCountless people have died for this struggle.

The process may be completed before the end of the year.\n\nThe proposed changes would not allow recreational use of the drugs.

In doing so, the administration ran afoul of the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires \u201creasoned\u201d explanations for government decisions, particularly when they represent reversals of well-studied actions.\n\nIt was a major defeat for President Trump, who attacked the Obama administration for stopping the project in the face of protests and an environmental impact study. Trump signed an executive order two days into his presidency setting in motion a course reversal on the Keystone XL pipeline, as well as another major pipeline, Dakota Access.\n\nThe ruling highlights a broader legal vulnerability in the Trump administration\u2019s push to roll back Obama-era environmental protections. Since Trump took office, federal courts have found repeatedly that his agencies have short-circuited the regulatory process in areas ranging from water protections to chemical plant safety operations. Robust environmental and administrative procedure laws, many dating back to the 1970s, have given the administration\u2019s opponents plenty of legal ammunition.\n\nThursday\u2019s decision does not permanently block a federal permit for Keystone XL, a project of the Calgary-based firm TransCanada. It requires the administration to conduct a more complete review of potential adverse impacts related to climate change, cultural resources and endangered species. The court basically ordered a do-over.\n\nIn a 54-page opinion, Morris hit the administration with a familiar charge that it disregarded facts, facts established by experts during the Obama administration about \u201cclimate-related impacts\u201d from Keystone XL. The Trump administration claimed, with no supporting information, that those impacts \u201cwould prove inconsequential,\u201d Morris wrote. The State Department \u201csimply discarded prior factual findings related to climate change to support its course reversal.\u201d\n\nIt also used \u201coutdated information\u201d about the impact of potential oil spills on endangered species, he said, rather than \u201c'the best scientific and commercial data available.'\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling makes it clear once and for all that it\u2019s time for TransCanada to give up on their Keystone XL pipe dream,\u201d said Sierra Club Senior Attorney Doug Hayes in a statement. The lawsuit prompting Thursday\u2019s order was brought by a collection of opponents, including the indigenous Environmental Network and the Northern Plains Resource Council, a conservation coalition based in Montana.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration tried to force this dirty pipeline project on the American people, but they can\u2019t ignore the threats it would pose to our clean water, our climate, and our communities,\u201d Hayes said.\n\nHayes told The Washington Post that the company had already been moving equipment into place in Montana and South Dakota with the intent of beginning construction in early 2019.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that this decision tonight will delay the pipeline significantly,\u201d said Hayes, who noted that a proper environmental impact statement of this scope usually takes about a year to complete. \u201cTransCanada does not have an approved pipeline at this point.\u201d\n\n[Read the decision]\n\nMorris, a former clerk to the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, was appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama.\n\nHis decision was one of scores of court rebukes to the Trump administration for decisions on the environment, immigration and transgender service in the military, among other issues, all made hastily and, in the opinions of dozens of judges, without the \u201creasoned consideration\u201d required by federal law. Also on Thursday, a federal appeals court ruled that Trump cannot immediately end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shields undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children from deportation.\n\nThe administration is appealing many of these rulings, and may challenge Thursday\u2019s decision as well. The administration did not issue an immediate comment after the pipeline order.\n\nIn a statement Friday, TransCanada said it was not abandoning its plans to construct the pipeline. \u201cWe have received the judge\u2019s ruling and continue to review it,\u201d said company spokesman Terry Cunha. \u201cWe remain committed to building this important energy infrastructure project.\u201d\n\nThe State Department has primary jurisdiction over the Keystone XL pipeline permit decision, by virtue of its authority to issue \u201cpresidential permits\u201d for cross-border infrastructure projects.\n\nThe massive project remains one of the most controversial infrastructure proposals in modern American history, with its proponents and critics dueling in court and on the streets for a decade.\n\nIt aims to extend TransCanada\u2019s existing Keystone pipeline, which was completed in 2013. Keystone XL (the initials stand for \u201cexport limited\u201d) would transport up to 830,000 barrels of crude oil per day from Alberta, Canada, and Montana to Oklahoma and the Gulf Coast. In the United States, the pipeline would stretch 875 miles through Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska, with the rest continuing into Canada.\n\n[The Keystone XL Pipeline and its politics, explained]\n\nIt has met sustained opposition from environmental advocacy groups, as well as from Obama, who rejected it three years ago on the grounds that it would accelerate climate change.\n\nActivists argue the pipeline would be especially damaging to the climate because it would mean extracting thick, low-quality oil from Canada\u2019s oil sands, with lots of tree-cutting and energy consumption in the process, which would increase greenhouse gas emissions. Native American groups in Montana and elsewhere fought the Keystone project as well, saying its route failed to adhere to historical treaty boundaries and would impinge on their water systems and sacred lands.\n\nIn 2015, on the eve of the international climate talks in Paris, the Obama administration appeared to bring an end to the seven-year-long saga when it announced it was halting construction of the pipeline, arguing that approval would compromise the country\u2019s effort to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. The United States, Obama said, was now a \u201cglobal leader when it comes to taking serious action to fight climate change.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd frankly, approving this project would have undercut that global leadership,\u201d he said, adding that the \u201cbiggest risk\u201d the United States faced was \u201cnot acting.\u201d\n\nThe decision to deny the pipeline permit came after the completion of a long-awaited final environmental impact statement \u2014 11 volumes of analysis released in 2014.\n\nIt was this 2014 assessment that the State Department, under the direction of Trump\u2019s January 2017 presidential memorandum, used to make its decision to approve the pipeline, The Post reported. According to the department, \u201cthere are no substantial changes or significant new information which would affect the continued reliability\u201d of the report.\n\nMorris said, however, that there were indeed changes since the 2014 assessment and that the Trump administration failed to consider them. He included among them pipeline leaks, the expansion of another pipeline called the Alberta Clipper and shifts in oil markets. Those could alter the overall impact of Keystone XL and should have been considered by the government.\n\nAmong the judge\u2019s findings:\n\nThe State Department, in issuing the permit, failed to \u201canalyze the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions\u201d of the Keystone project and the expanded Alberta Clipper pipeline. It \u201cignored its duty to take a \u2018hard look\u2019 at these two connected actions.\"\n\nThe department \u201cacted on incomplete information regarding\u201d the potential damage to cultural resources in Indian territory along the route. \u201cThe Department appears to have jumped the gun.\u201d\n\nThe department failed to make a fact-based explanation for its course reversal, \u201clet alone a reasoned explanation. ...'An agency cannot simply disregard contrary or inconvenient factual determinations that it made in the past, any more than it can ignore inconvenient facts' \" in the present, he wrote, quoting judicial precedents.\n\nThe department\u2019s analysis that \u201cclimate-related impacts\u201d from Keystone \u201cwould prove inconsequential\u201d needed a \u201creasoned explanation.\u201d It did not provide one.\n\nJackie Prange, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the ruling a \u201chuge win\u201d not just for the environmental activists and tribal groups who have been fighting the pipeline, but for \u201canyone who cares about the rule of law and holding this administration to the facts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s emblematic of what we\u2019re seeing with the Trump administration, which is a very fast and sloppy reversal of prior decisions \u2026 in a way that doesn\u2019t adhere to the rule of law,\u201d Prange told The Post. \u201cThat\u2019s why we keep winning in the court.\u201d", "ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 The fiancee of slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi has expressed \u201cshock and sadness\u201d over reports suggesting that his body may have been dissolved with chemicals.\n\nHatice Cengiz said on Twitter late Thursday that Khashoggi\u2019s killers had deprived his loved ones of conducting funeral prayers and burying him in Medina, Saudi Arabia, as he had wished.\n\nTurkey says the Washington Post columnist, who was critical of the Saudi crown prince, was strangled and dismembered at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 by a 15-member assassination squad.

During his rallies before the midterm elections, the president all but acknowledged that he had been claiming the \u201ccaravan\u201d of migrants traveling from Honduras contained criminal elements without evidence. But then the Department of Homeland Security came to the rescue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of heat because, I was saying, there were some bad people in that caravan. Right? So we checked, 300 people,\" he said at one rally. At another rally, he said, \u201cThey gave you 300 names yesterday.\u201d\n\nActually, there were no names. There\u2019s just a vague news release issued Nov. 1 titled \u201cMyth vs. Fact: Caravan.\u201d\n\nThe language in this release is highly suspect. It raises more questions than it answers, but DHS offered only \u201coff the record\u201d answers \u2014 which we could not use \u2014 that did not really answer our questions. Before publication, we received this statement, attributed to DHS press secretary Tyler Q. Houlton:\n\n\u201cLast year 17,000 criminal aliens were apprehended attempting to enter our country illegally. We stand by our previous release that there are a large number of individuals with criminal convictions traveling with the caravan flow. In fact, we have identified an additional 200 criminals in this group since our prior statement.\u201d\n\nWith no explanation, one could simply dismiss that statistic as propaganda. But we will dissect the news release and offer some explanations for the data in it.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThere are several iterations of the caravan, which is slowly moving through Mexico. The high estimate for the first group was 7,000 people, but many have dropped off, so now it\u2019s about 4,000 to 5,000 people, some traveling quickly as others go more slowly.\n\nMexico City authorities say that of the 4,841 registered migrants receiving shelter in a sports complex, 1,726 are under 18, including 310 children under 5, the Associated Press reported Nov. 8. Mexico City is 600 miles from the U.S. border and there are perhaps an additional 4,000 people in caravans moving through southern Mexico.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some of the odd language in the news release. It refers to \u201cindividuals along the caravan route ... over 270 individuals along the caravan route have criminal histories. \u2026 We also continue to see individuals from over 20 countries in this flow from countries such as Somalia, India, Haiti, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh.\u201d\n\nNotice that DHS does not refer to people in the caravan. These are people \u201calong the caravan route,\u201d which is more than 1,000 miles long. It also refers to individuals \u201cin this flow,\u201d which sounds like code for people migrating across the Honduran border.\n\nThe reference to \u201cSomalia, India, Haiti, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh\u201d is a bit of a tell. The Mexican National Institute of Migration (INM) publishes online information regarding the nationalities of the people who cross its borders, and it is easy to find information for crossings in Tapachula, where the caravan crossed into Mexico from Guatemala.\n\nThe data shows that so far this year, 28 people from Somalia, 105 people from Haiti, 10 people from Afghanistan, 1,038 people from Bangladesh and 2,940 people from India have entered Mexico in Tapachula.\n\n\u201cThis is the entrance point into Mexico for people from Africa, Asia, the Middle East who have been making the journey across Latin America,\u201d said Stephanie Leutert, director of the Mexican Security Initiative at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cIn Tapachula these migrants can receive the oficio de salida (exit permit) from INM that gives them two weeks or so to leave the country. Then there are enterprising travel agents (often from within the nationality \u2014 i.e. South Asian community targeting South Asians) selling them bus tickets or flights directly to the U.S.-Mexico border. Once they receive the oficio de salida, they should be in INM\u2019s database that is then ostensibly shared with U.S. officials.\u201d\n\nLeutert, who has traveled extensively along the 700-mile border of southern Mexico, said it would make \u201czero sense\u201d for such nationalities to be traveling in the caravan because they qualify for an exit permit and legally can take a bus to the United States to request asylum.\n\nSo, cross off the reference to these nationalities being \u201cin the flow.\u201d But the news release also says \u201cmore than 270 individuals along the caravan route have criminal histories.\u201d What could that mean?\n\nThe Washington Post reported in April that the United States has expanded a program to capture the biometric data of tens of thousands of Central Americans and other migrants arrested in Mexico. Officials had installed scores of screening terminals in detention facilities to collect migrants\u2019 fingerprints, ocular scans and other identifying features. The information collected is then checked against DHS and other U.S. criminal databases.\n\nSince DHS won\u2019t comment, we can only speculate that biometric data is being collected if migrants are being detained or perhaps if they sign up for Mexico\u2019s new \u201cYou\u2019re at Home\u201d program. The program is supposed to provide shelter, medical attention, schooling and work permits to members of the caravan who agree to stay there. About 2,700 migrants are said to have received temporary visas in Mexico. Of course, then they would not be part of the caravan anymore.\n\nThe news release refers to people with \u201ccriminal histories.\u201d There are four examples given: aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, armed robbery, sexual assault on a child and assault on a woman. As it turns out, the Mexican government has announced that it had deported at least six (and possibly eight) Hondurans who were part of the caravan, based on notices from Interpol alleging murder, robbery and other crimes. All were detected in Chiapas, a southern state bordering Guatemala, shortly after they arrived in Mexican territory.\n\nSince they were deported, they obviously are not in the caravan anymore. Mexican officials on the route have told Post reporters that they haven\u00b4t seen any serious criminals.\n\nSo who could the rest of the people with \u201ccriminal histories\u201d be? We can get a clue from the 2014 surge, which was the subject of a report issued by DHS in August. That report said that 5 percent of the people apprehended at the southern border had a criminal record. (About 50 percent of the people apprehended were from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.)\n\nThe report does not detail the crimes. But other DHS data shows that 32 percent of the undocumented immigrants deported in fiscal 2014 as \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d were convicted of immigration crimes, such as illegal entry. Sixteen percent were removed for drug offenses, 14 percent for traffic offenses, 10 percent were removed for assault and 1.7 percent for sexual assault.\n\nIn other words, because the biometric data is checked against U.S. criminal databases, a large percentage of people with \u201ccriminal histories\u201d may simply be guilty of previously trying to enter the United States. Yet the news release highlights a sampling of violent crimes.\n\nNote that during the 2014 surge, 5 percent had criminal histories. Five percent of 4,000 to 8,000 is 200 to 400 people, or roughly the number highlighted by DHS. That also means that 95 percent of the people traveling in the caravan do not have criminal histories \u2013 and yet the president sent more than 5,000 U.S. troops to the border.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nAny crowd of 7,000 people is going to have some bad apples. Mexican officials have already identified several and deported them, so they are no longer a potential threat. But it is dismaying that DHS will issue a fuzzy news release to justify presidential assertions, and then refuse to explain how the numbers were calculated.\n\nThe president even falsely claimed to a crowd of supporters that 300 names had been published. At far as we can tell, Mexican officials have only identified two people by name.\n\nWhile a sampling of crimes is identified, these crimes appear to be associated with the migrants already deported by Mexico. Since DHS will not break out a list of crimes, we suspect most of these people with \u201ccriminal histories\u201d are not actually violent. That aligns with the information provided by Mexican officials tracking the caravan, though the president called them \u201crough, rough people.\u201d We also do not know how many people said to have criminal histories have actually dropped off from the caravan and are staying in Mexico.\n\nStill, numbers issued by DHS \u2014 270 to 470 \u2014 are roughly consistent with the percentage of people with criminal pasts \u2014 5 percent \u2014 in the 2014 surge. So it may not be completely out of line even if the possible criminality is hyped.

Denny Tamaki speaks during a press conference at the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of Japan (FCCJ) in Tokyo, Friday, Nov. 9, 2018. Gov. Tamaki talked to the media ahead of his U.S. trip to raise awareness among Americans about the tiny southern island\u2019s burden of hosting most of American troops (Sadayuki Goto/Kyodo News via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nTOKYO \u2014 The outspoken governor of Japan\u2019s Okinawa island said Friday he will meet with American officials next week to convey the frustration of residents from hosting U.S. military bases on the southern island.\n\nDenny Tamaki said he will meet with officials in Washington and speak at New York University during his Nov. 11-16 trip.\n\n\u201cI hope to speak directly to American citizens and convey my views representing Okinawa and have a discussion about democracy,\u201d Tamaki told a packed news conference in Tokyo.\n\nTamaki took office Oct. 4 after campaigning for the closure of a disputed U.S. base on Okinawa and a reduction of the American military presence there. He said he wanted to visit the U.S. soon after his election so that the voices of voters would be heard.\n\nTamaki, the first person with an American parent to lead Okinawa, said his roots make him a perfect figure to relay the message to the U.S. public.\n\nAt the center of contention is a decades-old plan to move a Marine Corps air station from densely populated Futenma in the southern part of the island to less-crowded Henoko on the east coast.\n\nMany Okinawans say the presence of so many U.S. troops on the island is burdensome and they want the Futenma base moved off the island entirely.\n\nTamaki, during an earlier visit to Tokyo in mid-October, urged Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other top officials to stop the Henoko plan and reduce Okinawa\u2019s burden. Despite his request and Okinawans\u2019 opposition, Abe\u2019s government last week resumed construction work at the disputed site at Henoko.\n\nThe construction reignited anger on the island, and Tamaki said he is determined to block its completion.\n\n\u201cOkinawa is working hard toward peace building, and based on that perspective we call on the Japanese government and the United States government to look at ways to reduce the burden of the bases and build peace. We call for deepening of their relationship and effort to achieve those goals,\u201d Tamaki said.\n\nHe said Japan\u2019s central government should negotiate with the U.S. in Okinawa\u2019s interest. \u201cAs the central government is not delivering Okinawans\u2019 voice to the U.S. side, it is now my responsibility to convey that directly to the Americans and they have a responsibility to listen to us,\u201d Tamaki said.\n\nHe has said he supports the Japan-U.S. security alliance, but that Okinawa should not be the only place forced to sacrifice.\n\nTamaki has also called for a review of the Status of Forces Agreement that gives privileges to the U.S. military, including some immunity from Japanese criminal investigation. Some experts say inequality under the agreement is greater in Japan than in nations that host U.S. forces in Europe.\n\nThe relocation of Futenma air station was planned after the 1995 rape of a schoolgirl in which three U.S. servicemen were convicted. The case ignited simmering Okinawan opposition to the U.S. bases.\n\nAbout half of the 50,000 U.S. troops based in Japan under the security pact and most of their key facilities are on Okinawa. Residents have long complained about base-related noise, pollution and crime.\n\nTamaki, the son of an American serviceman whom he has never seen, said he was bullied as a child because of his lighter skin color and reddish hair. That experience later gave him respect for diversity and his identity, he said.\n\nComing from a single-parent family that struggled to make ends meet, he is now a governor and is seen as a symbol of \u201cOkinawan dream,\u201d he said, holding up the guestbook at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan which he signed with the message \u201cDreams come true!\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

More than a decade before the Nazis seized power in Germany, Albert Einstein was on the run and already fearful for his country\u2019s future, according to a newly revealed handwritten letter. (Associated Press)\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 More than a decade before the Nazis seized power in Germany, Albert Einstein was on the run and already fearful for his country\u2019s future, according to a newly revealed handwritten letter.\n\nHis longtime friend and fellow Jew, German Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau, had just been assassinated by right-wing extremists and police had warned the noted physicist that his life could be in danger too.\n\nSo Einstein fled Berlin and went into hiding in northern Germany. It was during this hiatus that he penned a handwritten letter to his beloved younger sister, Maja, warning of the dangers of growing nationalism and anti-Semitism years before the Nazis ultimately rose to power, forcing Einstein to flee his native Germany for good.\n\n\u201cOut here, nobody knows where I am, and I\u2019m believed to be away on a trip,\u201d he wrote in August 1922. \u201cHere are brewing economically and politically dark times, so I\u2019m happy to be able to get away from everything.\u201d\n\nThe previously unknown letter, brought forward by an anonymous collector, is set to go on auction next week in Jerusalem with an opening asking price of $12,000.\n\nAs the most influential scientist of the 20th century, Einstein\u2019s life and writings have been thoroughly researched. The Hebrew University in Jerusalem, of which Einstein was a founder, houses the world\u2019s largest collection of Einstein material. Together with the California Institute of Technology it runs the Einstein Papers Project. Individual auctions of his personal letters have brought in substantial sums in recent years.\n\nThe 1922 letter shows he was concerned about Germany\u2019s future a full year before the Nazis even attempted their first coup \u2014 the failed Munich Beer Hall Putsch to seize power in Bavaria.\n\n\u201cThis letter reveals to us the thoughts that were running through Einstein\u2019s mind and heart at a very preliminary stage of Nazi terror,\u201d said Meron Eren, co-owner of the Kedem Auction House in Jerusalem, which obtained the letter and offered The Associated Press a glimpse before the public sale. \u201cThe relationship between Albert and Maja was very special and close, which adds another dimension to Einstein the man and greater authenticity to his writings.\u201d\n\nThe letter, which bears no return address, is presumed to have been written while he was staying in the port city of Kiel before embarking on a lengthy speaking tour across Asia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing pretty well, despite all the anti-Semites among the German colleagues. I\u2019m very reclusive here, without noise and without unpleasant feelings, and am earning my money mainly independent of the state, so that I\u2019m really a free man,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou see, I am about to become some kind of itinerant preacher. That is, firstly, pleasant and, secondly, necessary.\u201d\n\nAddressing his sister\u2019s concerns, Einstein writes: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, I myself don\u2019t worry either, even if it\u2019s not quite kosher, people are very upset. In Italy, it seems to be at least as bad.\u201d\n\nLater in 1922, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics.\n\nZe\u2019ev Rosenkranz, the assistant director of the Einstein Papers Project at Caltech, said the letter wasn\u2019t the first time Einstein warned about German anti-Semitism, but it captured his state of mind at this important junction after Rathenau\u2019s killing and the \u201cinternal exile\u201d he imposed on himself shortly after it.\n\n\u201cEinstein\u2019s initial reaction was one of panic and a desire to leave Germany for good. Within a week, he had changed his mind,\u201d he said. \u201cThe letter reveals a mindset rather typical of Einstein in which he claims to be impervious to external pressures. One reason may be to assuage his sister\u2019s concerns. Another is that he didn\u2019t like to admit that he was stressed about external factors.\u201d\n\nWhen the Nazis came to power and began enacting legislation against Jews, they also aimed to purge Jewish scientists. The Nazis dismissed Einstein\u2019s groundbreaking work, including his Law of Relativity, as \u201cJewish Physics.\u201d\n\nEinstein renounced his German citizenship in 1933 after Hitler became chancellor. The physicist settled in the United States, where he would remain until his death in 1955.\n\nEinstein declined an invitation to serve as the first president of the newly established state of Israel but left behind his literary estate and personal papers to the Hebrew University.\n\n___\n\nFollow Aron Heller at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Nor must it lead to conflict,\u201d Mattis said.\n\nAlthough the rescheduling of the dialogue signaled an effort by the two sides to contain the slide in the relationship, it did not address the core dispute on trade. Trump has slapped tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products, in a push to narrow the U.S. trade deficit and push back against what the U.S. views as predatory Chinese tactics on the high technology industry. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on $110 million worth of U.S. goods.\n\nYun Sun, a China expert at the Stimson Center think tank, said Beijing is uncertain about what exactly Trump wants out of a trade deal, but hopes that with U.S. midterm elections out of the way, the mercurial American president may be more inclined to reach a compromise. \u201cTheir top priority is to stabilize relations,\u201d she said.\n\nOn human rights, Pompeo voiced concern over China\u2019s treatment of religious minorities, including the mass detention of minority Uighur Muslims. But overall, the tone of the U.S. officials\u2019 public comments was milder than that of the Chinese. Yang insisted that Chinese people have freedom of religion, and that \u201cforeign countries have no right to interfere.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

But delegates widely acknowledged that the meeting itself was a feat.\n\nAs they gathered around a large circular table in a Moscow hotel, the atmosphere was jovial and almost festive. Hugs were exchanged with members of the Taliban. There was waving and winking at familiar faces.\n\nAhead of the talks, Taliban delegates gathered in the lobby to drink cups of green tea, while their Russian minders downed lattes.\n\nTaliban delegates said they laid out the Islamist insurgent group\u2019s demands for a peace process. They also reiterated their wish to speak to the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cConsidering our main demand is the withdrawal of foreign troops, we will discuss peaceful settlement with the Americans,\u201d said the Taliban\u2019s top political envoy, Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai. \u201cWe do not recognize the incumbent government as legitimate.\u201d\n\n\n\nA representative from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow attended, but only as an observer.\n\nBringing both sides of the Afghan conflict to Moscow is still a major success for Russia as the Kremlin seeks to reclaim its clout and influence on the world stage.\n\nAfghanistan also brings up some painful historical memories. Nearly 40 years have passed since the Red Army invaded Afghanistan, beginning a disastrous decade-long war that ended with the Soviets\u2019 humiliating withdrawal.\n\n\u201cRussia has the experience of war. If it gains the experience of peace, we welcome it,\u201d said Habiba Sarabi, the deputy chair of the High Peace Council and the only woman \u2014 from any country \u2014 to take part in the talks.\n\nSarabi said she pushed the Taliban on the plight of Afghan women, who were denied basic rights during the Taliban\u2019s reign, which drew worldwide scorn of the country and a loss of credibility.\n\n\u201cI asked them, \u2018When will you bring a woman to these talks?\u201d Sarabi said. \u201cThey laughed and said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you represent us?\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn recent years, the Taliban has sought to redress its notorious shortcomings in the area of women\u2019s rights, publicly stating that all girls and women should have access to education. But there are deep suspicions over the Taliban\u2019s claims.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to give women all the rights that exist in Islam,\u201d said Muhammad Sohail Shaheen, a spokesman from the Taliban delegation. \u201cThis means education, work, property. We ask only one thing, that they observe wearing the veil.\u201d\n\nThe talks come after years of back-channel diplomacy between Moscow and the Taliban.\n\nThe Taliban has spoken to a range of countries in recent years, including the United States, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Iran, but often under the shroud of secrecy.\n\nFriday\u2019s meeting in Moscow was the first of its kind to take place publicly.\n\nA previous attempt to host Afghan talks two months ago was thwarted \u2014 and the Kremlin\u2019s invitation to the Taliban rescinded \u2014 when the Afghan government objected, saying it must lead the outreach. Washington also declined to attend, saying the talks were unlikely to yield any progress.\n\nKabul chose not to send diplomats to Friday\u2019s talks, instead sending the High Peace Council.\n\n\u201cThe United States stands ready to work with all interested parties to support and facilitate a peace process,\u201d State Department deputy spokesman Robert Palladino said this week.\n\nAny peace plan also would need close coordination with the U.S. military.\n\nHeavily strained ties between Washington and Moscow are influencing decisions on who should join the Afghan talks, according to a former senior U.S. official. \u201cThe U.S., of course, is naturally skeptical, but that\u2019s only because the Russians are convening it,\u201d said the former official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss views on U.S. diplomacy.\n\nThe Taliban delegation came from its political office in Doha, the Qatari capital. That office, established in 2011, is increasingly acting as a mediator.\n\nIn recent months, the U.S. special adviser on Afghan peace, Zalmay Khalilzad, met Taliban representatives in Qatar, where both sides agreed to continue dialogue. Khalilzad\u2019s reported meeting \u2014 only the Taliban vouched it had taken place \u2014 came just months after senior State Department official Alice Wells went there.\n\nLast year, President Trump roughly doubled the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, to the current deployment of 14,000.\n\nBesides serving as a potential peace broker, Russia has considerable worries of its own about an unstable Afghanistan.\n\nGroups affiliated with the Islamic State have gained footholds in northern Afghanistan near countries with close Moscow ties, including Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.

The war lives on in the Western imagination as a hideous (and arguably needless) conflict that killed millions, turned the fields of Europe into moonscapes, collapsed empires and prefigured an even bloodier war a generation later. Its memory and legacy still offer profound lessons for the present.\n\nIn hosting the ceremonies, French President Emmanuel Macron hopes to score a political point. World War I was a clash of violent nationalist passions, fueled by a coterie of power-hungry elites. Now there\u2019s a rising tide of nationalism in Europe, with far-right leaders in Western Europe and illiberal statesmen in countries such as Hungary challenging the liberal ideals of the European Union and the cooperation and multilateralism that once guaranteed its prosperity.\n\nMacron wants that story of unilateralism and conflict to be a cautionary tale for his contemporaries. \u201cA survival-of-the-fittest approach does not protect any group of people against any kind of threat,\u201d he said recently.\n\n\u201cWe in the West, in particular, have been extremely lucky. We\u2019ve lived through an extremely long period of peace,\u201d said Oxford historian Margaret MacMillan to my colleagues. \u201cThe worry is that we take peace for granted and think it\u2019s a normal state of affairs. We should reflect that sometimes wars do happen \u2014 and sometimes not for very good reasons.\u201d\n\nToday President @EmmanuelMacron visits the Notre-Dame-de-Lorette national cemetery to visit the anneau de la m\u00e9moire, or the Memory ring, to honor the #WWICentennial and the 100s of thousands of soldiers from 40 different nations who perished in Nord-Pas-de-Calais during #WWI. pic.twitter.com/K2ovBKfyAu \u2014 French Embassy U.S. (@franceintheus) November 8, 2018\n\nThat message is unlikely to get through to Trump. His treaty busting and ally bullying have strained trans-Atlantic ties and encouraged Europe\u2019s anti-establishment forces. His overt nationalism and embrace of protectionism, critics say, have undermined American leadership and called into question the future of the international order constructed by the United States after World War II.\n\nIvo Daalder, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO and co-author of \u201cThe Empty Throne: America\u2019s Abdication of Global Leadership,\u201d said that while Trump and his counterparts are celebrating the end of what\u2019s known as the Great War, they should \u201calso reflect on America\u2019s greatest mistake.\u201d That is, a decision to eschew the internationalism of then-President Woodrow Wilson for the isolationism of his interwar successors.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda also harks back to that historic withdrawal, when skepticism about foreign entanglements and fear of immigrants defined national policy at home and abroad. This circling of the wagons had significant geopolitical consequences.\n\n\u201cIn the 1920s, conservative Presidents Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover rejected both binding alliances and the notion that America should make economic sacrifices to uphold the geopolitical order,\u201d noted the Atlantic\u2019s Peter Beinart in an essay earlier this year. \u201cThey saw little difference between Britain and France, which were more democratic, and Germany, which was more authoritarian,\" he continued, \"and insisted that America remain independent from them all. They opposed Woodrow Wilson\u2019s dream of requiring America to aid European nations threatened with aggression through the League of Nations.\u201d\n\nIn 1919 and 1920, the U.S. Senate rejected signing the Treaty of Versailles and joining the League of Nations, the new international organization intended to stave off future bloody catastrophes. The American absence possibly doomed the project at its birth.\n\n\u201cWhy would other societies invest in the agreement if one of its leading proponents, also one of the emerging world powers, refused to participate? Many observers appreciated the domestic politics behind the U.S. rejection of the treaty, but that only deepened long-standing perceptions that the United States was an unreliable partner,\" wrote Jeremy Suri, a historian at the University of Texas at Austin. \"Why should others tie their hands if the United States acted as a free rider? In the decade after the First World War, U.S. actions encouraged unilateralism by other powerful actors, especially Japan, Germany, and the newly formed Soviet Union.\u201d\n\nVIDEO: 72,396 shrouded figures, part of the installation \"Shrouds of the Somme\" by British artist Rob Heard, are laid out in London to represent Commonwealth servicemen in WWI who died at the Somme and have no known grave pic.twitter.com/pIxrypVLDM \u2014 AFP news agency (@AFP) November 8, 2018\n\nDonning the steel helmets of the past, Trump has repeatedly championed his right to act unilaterally and sneered at international forums like the United Nations, the European Union and NATO. \u201cFor nationalists like John Bolton, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, the League\u2019s failure has become a byword for the futility of global governance,\u201d wrote Gideon Rachman of the Financial Times. \u201cIn the 1930s, the League was completely unable to act as an effective check on the ambitions of imperial Japan, Mussolini\u2019s Italy and Nazi Germany. The realist-nationalist view is that it was only hard power deployed by nation states \u2014 rather than global governance deployed by international institutions \u2014 that stood a chance of checking the ambitions of dictators.\u201d\n\nBut this view gets it precisely backward, Daalder argued. It was the effects of American disengagement after World War I that convinced the next generation of U.S. strategists to build the international institutions and security pacts that defined the latter half of the 20th century and brought lasting peace to Europe. Now, as Daalder and his co-author James Lindsay write, Trump\u2019s reckless foreign policy is hastening a new era of \u201cever-growing disarray\u201d or even a \u201creturn to the world of the late 19th century\u201d \u2014 the tinderbox that exploded into World War I.\n\n\u201cMy big fear is that the return to nationalism and protectionism is likely to deepen divisions between countries, to erode norms and standards of behavior, and erode the element of cooperation that has been fundamental to U.S. security and prosperity,\u201d Daalder told Today\u2019s WorldView. \u201cWe know what great power rivalry looks like. We know where it ends up.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

Could it be the hair?\n\nTo be sure, the titular protagonist of \u201cThe Girl in the Spider\u2019s Web: A New Dragon Tattoo Story\u201d has changed her look dramatically since 2011\u2019s \u201cThe Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\u201d There, she sported an asymmetrical, homemade-looking punk-rock mop and several scary facial piercings. Here, she looks like a medieval monk who time-traveled to the West Village: hip, but just this side of severe.\n\nOne other thing: The character in the new film is played by Claire Foy. The other one was played by Rooney Mara.\n\nAnd yet there are more changes than meet the eye in this second American film based on the endearingly damaged, avenging-computer-hacker character created by the late Swedish writer Stieg Larsson. Skipping books 2 and 3 of Larsson\u2019s best-selling trilogy, which have not yet been made into Hollywood films, and possibly never will be, \u201cSpider\u2019s Web\u201d has jumped ahead, taking its inspiration from a fourth Lisbeth Salander novel that was written by David Lagercrantz after Larsson\u2019s death. (Larsson\u2019s domestic partner, Eva Gabrielsson, has bitterly criticized Lagercrantz\u2019s book as \u201cgrave robbing.\u201d)\n\nJudging only by these two films, the Lisbeth of \u201cTattoo\u201d \u2014 at once feral, brilliant, angry, ethically challenged and, as many have mused, somewhere on the spectrum \u2014 has morphed into a kind of elite ninja warrior and international cybercriminal: an emotionally distant Jane Bond with a bad attitude and a black belt in Krav Maga.\n\nIn some respects, this Lisbeth doesn\u2019t feel like the same person, even taking into consideration her character\u2019s evolution in the intervening books (which did get made into Swedish movies starring Noomi Rapace). The Lisbeth of \u201cSpider\u2019s Web\u201d is still, as she is variously described in the new movie, a \u201chacker with a history of aggravated assault,\u201d \u201cthe girl who rights wrongs,\u201d \u201cthe girl who hurts men who hurt women\u201d and a \u201cfreak.\u201d But there\u2019s a level of professionalism and polish to what she does that is slightly off-putting.\n\nIt\u2019s as if, in this go-round, the dragon tattoo that adorns much of Lisbeth\u2019s body had been replaced with a logo. As this movie\u2019s ungainly subtitle suggests, the freak has become a franchise.\n\n\n\nAs Lisbeth Salander, Claire Foy, left, metes out punishment to men who hurt women in \u201cThe Girl in the Spider\u2019s Web: A New Dragon Tattoo Story.\u201d (Nadja Klier/Sony Pictures Entertainment)\n\nIn many respects, the fault lies not with Lisbeth but with the overly conventional story she\u2019s caught up in, like a \u2014 sorry \u2014 spider\u2019s web. After the Stockholm-based Lisbeth is hired to steal software from the National Security Agency \u2014 a program that would enable any user to access the military arsenals of any country \u2014 she has second thoughts about handing it over, even to the guy who created it (Stephen Merchant). But other, potentially less scrupulous people want it, too: the NSA agent who let it slip through his fingers (Lakeith Stanfield); his counterpart in Swedish intelligence; and a shadowy collective of mercenaries and arms brokers known as the Spiders.\n\nEvents proceed as they so often do in these things. Cars are chased and bullets are dodged \u2014 some less successfully than others \u2014 until the cliches start clanging like clockwork, drowning out what was so appealing about Lisbeth in the first place: her quiet, almost mesmerizing brokenness. (She\u2019s a survivor whose trauma, perversely, feeds her, as we learn in a flashback prologue to Lisbeth\u2019s childhood. A tantalizing bit of personal history, and how it has empowered her, is revealed.)\n\nFoy makes for a magnetic, if poker-faced, heroine, even if her partner, journalist Mikael Blomkvist, is a washout this time. Replacing \u201cTattoo\u2019s\u201d Daniel Craig, Swedish actor Sverrir Gudnason has a much smaller role here as Lisbeth\u2019s sidekick \u2014 and a much more forgettable screen presence.\n\n\u201cSpider\u2019s Web\u201d may have its flaws, including a bit of villainous motivation so oversimplified it makes Dr. Evil\u2019s thought processes look like Einstein\u2019s. And yet despite Lisbeth\u2019s makeover, there\u2019s still something cool, complicated and compelling about this \u201cGirl.\u201d Lisbeth may be stuck in a silly movie, but she\u2019s nobody\u2019s victim.", "Advice columnist\n\nDear Carolyn: Our extended family \u2014 siblings and kids \u2014 has always gathered at Thanksgiving and Christmas. Last week I got a text from my sister saying she and her family would be going away for the holiday and would no longer host Christmas Eve at their home.\n\nThis came out of the blue and is really upsetting me. My brother and I have both been widowed in the last four years and this event was something we looked forward to because everyone attended and it was a lot of fun. (My brother has grown children; I do not.) We feel surprised and unwanted and don't understand the decision.\n\nOf course it is their right to celebrate as they wish, and I kick myself for expecting a 30-year tradition to continue. But I can't figure out how to feel okay about this. I feel rejected, and I don't know why they would do that.\n\nMaybe it wouldn't be so painful if I had a family of my own, but I no longer do.

It\u2019s been only a week.\n\nIt\u2019s also really good that you stuck to the limited \u201cI\u2019m disappointed\u201d response. As you said yourself, this is their holiday to plan as they choose, so pushback would be inappropriate. Worse, it could sour your relationship with your sister, which could then retroactively tarnish past Christmas Eves.\n\nThis disappointment may have come to you from the outside, but your work now is strictly internal and doesn\u2019t involve your sister \u2014 except, genuinely, when you\u2019re ready: \u201cI\u2019ll miss the tradition, but I admire you for having the courage to do what you needed. Carrying the expectations of the entire family for three decades can\u2019t have been easy for you.\n\n\u201cThank you for those 30 years.\u201d\n\nWhich beats berating her for the 31st.\n\nWhich brings me to the next point: Isn\u2019t fatigue more than enough to explain \u201cwhy they would do that\u201d? You mention grown kids and 30-year traditions and widowhood (my condolences), so I hope I can inoffensively deduce that you\u2019re all in the slowing-down years. Therefore, you have the option to interpret this as a slowing-down, period, vs. torturing yourself with ways to take it personally.\n\nSlowdowns bring their own grief for sure, but they have nothing to do with being \u201crejected,\u201d \u201cleft out\u201d and/or \u201cunwanted.\u201d You can be wanted and accepted yet still affected when the terms of inclusion must change.\n\nSo you don\u2019t have to feel okay about this anytime soon, but I urge you to turn your thoughts \u2014 as soon as you\u2019re ready \u2014 to inclusion that\u2019s easier on everyone.

Anti-Marcos activists and human rights victims welcomed the conviction as long overdue.\n\nThe court disqualified Marcos from holding public office, but she can remain a member of the powerful House of Representatives while appealing the decision. Her congressional term will end next year but she has registered to run to replace her daughter as governor of northern Ilocos Norte province.\n\n\u201cI was jumping up and down in joy in disbelief,\u201d said former Commission on Human Rights chairwoman Loretta Ann Rosales, who was among many activists locked up after Imelda\u2019s husband, former President Ferdinand Marcos, declared martial law in the Philippines in 1972.\n\nRosales said the decision was a huge setback to efforts by the Marcos family to revise history by denying many of the atrocities under the dictatorship, and urged Filipinos to fight all threats against democracy and civil liberties.\n\nFormer Sen. Aquilino Pimentel Jr., who was also jailed during the Marcos dictatorship, said it was up to voters in next year\u2019s May 13 local elections, where Marcos is a candidate, if they want \u201csomebody who has a bad name representing them, that\u2019s your call.\u201d\n\nImelda Marcos\u2019 husband was ousted by an army-backed \u201cpeople power\u201d revolt in 1986.

Most have been elected to public offices in an impressive political comeback.\n\nGovernment prosecutor Ryan Quilala told reporters that Marcos and her husband opened and managed Swiss foundations in violation of the Philippine Constitution, using aliases in a bid to hide stolen funds. The Marcoses have been accused of plundering the government\u2019s coffers amid crushing poverty. They have denied any wrongdoing and have successfully fought many other corruption cases.\n\nImelda Marcos was acquitted Friday in three other cases, which were filed in 1991 and took nearly three decades of trial by several judges and prosecutors. She was once convicted of a graft case in 1993, but the Supreme Court later cleared her of any wrongdoing.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte, an ally of the Marcoses, said last year the Marcos family had indicated a willingness to return a still-unspecified amount of money and \u201ca few gold bars\u201d to help ease budget deficits. He indicated the family still denied that the assets had been stolen as alleged by political opponents.\n\nFerdinand Marcos had placed the Philippines under martial rule a year before his term was to expire. He padlocked Congress, ordered the arrest of political rivals and left-wing activists and ruled by decree. His family is said to have amassed an estimated $5 billion to $10 billion while he was in power.\n\nA Hawaii court found Marcos liable for human rights violations and awarded $2 billion from his estate to compensate more than 9,000 Filipinos who filed a lawsuit against him for torture, incarceration, extrajudicial killings and disappearances.\n\nDuterte has acknowledged that Imee Marcos, the couple\u2019s daughter and a provincial governor, backed his presidential candidacy.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Charles Sykes/Invision/AP)\n\nAs Michelle Obama\u2019s highly anticipated memoir \u201cBecoming\u201d arrives, it\u2019s clear that the former first lady is occupying a space in the culture beyond politics. With an arena book tour featuring A-list special guests, she seems to exist in the middle ground between two icons she calls friends, Oprah Winfrey and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles-Carter. Her approach is short of Winfrey\u2019s full-on confessional style but goes further than the guarded intimacy of Knowles-Carter\u2019s art and performances.\n\nHer book walks a similar line. It\u2019s revealing, right down to the glossy cover photo in a casual white top \u2014 one shoulder exposed, eyes bright. (Spoiler: It\u2019s not the kind of shirt a soon-to-be political candidate wears.) But Obama, who was famously guarded as first lady, still values her privacy \u2014 even as she offers frank opinions about Donald Trump and discloses past fertility struggles.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody will be necessarily prepared to read a memoir like this \u2014 especially coming from a first lady,\u201d said Shonda Rhimes, the television producer, who read an advance copy of Obama\u2019s book.\n\nThe first-lady memoir is a rite of passage, but Obama\u2019s is different by virtue of her very identity. \u201cBecoming\u201d takes her historic status as the first black woman to serve as first lady and melds it deftly into the American narrative. She writes of the common aspects of her story and \u2014 as the only White House resident to count an enslaved great-great-grandfather as an ancestor \u2014 of its singular sweep.\n\n\n\n\u201cBecoming,\u201d by Michelle Obama (Crown)\n\nIn the 426-page book, Obama lays out her complicated relationship with the political world that made her famous. But her memoir is not a Washington read full of gossip and political score-settling \u2014 though she does lay bare her deep, quaking disdain for Trump, who she believes put her family\u2019s safety at risk with his vehement promotion of the false birther conspiracy theory.\n\n\u201cThe whole [birther] thing was crazy and mean-spirited, of course, its underlying bigotry and xenophobia hardly concealed. But it was also dangerous, deliberately meant to stir up the wingnuts and kooks,\u201d she writes. \u201cWhat if someone with an unstable mind loaded a gun and drove to Washington? What if that person went looking for our girls? Donald Trump, with his loud and reckless innuendos, was putting my family\u2019s safety at risk. And for this I\u2019d never forgive him.\u201d\n\nIt is the most direct and personal language she\u2019s used about him. Trump reacted angrily Friday, jabbing his finger as he told reporters that book publishers encourage controversy. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll give you a little controversy back. . . . I\u2019ll never forgive him for what he did to our United States military. I\u2019ll never forgive him for what he did in many other ways, which I\u2019ll talk to you about in the future.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post obtained an early copy of Obama\u2019s book, which will be released Tuesday. Even those who have followed Obama\u2019s life closely in the decade and a half since her husband was a relatively unknown Illinois politician will come away with fresh understanding of how she sees the world and the people and experiences that shaped her.\n\nShe divides the memoir into three parts: Becoming Me, Becoming Us, Becoming More. The first section is a deep, often sociological exploration of Chicago and the people and institutions there. Its textured discussion of gentrification, public education, race and class are reminders that Obama majored in sociology and minored in African American studies at Princeton University.\n\nThe second section, Becoming Us, is a romp through her romance with Barack Obama, starting a family with him and her search for work that she loved. It begins with words that have never before been written by a first lady about her man: \u201cAs soon as I allowed myself to feel anything for Barack, the feelings came rushing \u2014 a toppling blast of lust, gratitude, fulfillment, wonder.\u201d\n\nThe third section, Becoming More, traverses their life as public figures. It contains her own view of her legacy and accomplishments as first lady and what it felt like to live under the intense scrutiny she faced. As she campaigned for her husband\u2019s reelection in 2012, she writes that she felt \u201chaunted\u201d by the ways she\u2019d been criticized and by people who had made assumptions about her based on the color of her skin.\n\nShe thought then about what she owed and to whom: \u201cI carried a history with me, and it wasn\u2019t that of presidents or first ladies. I\u2019d never related to the story of John Quincy Adams the way I did to that of Sojourner Truth.\u201d\n\n\n\nMichelle Obama prepares to take the stage during a When We All Vote rally in September. (Joe Buglewicz for The Washington Post)\n\nFrom the preface, Obama promises a story that covers the full contour of her life \u2014 growing up in a \"cramped apartment on the South Side of Chicago\" to living in \"a place with more stairs than I can count.\" From \"being held up as the most powerful woman in the world\" to being \"taken down as an 'angry black woman.' \"\n\nShe returns to a discussion of what she calls the angry black woman \u201ctrap\u201d that dogged her: \u201cI was female, black and strong, which to certain people . . . translated only to \u2018angry.\u2019 It was another damaging cliche, one that\u2019s been forever used to sweep minority women to the perimeter of every room. . . . I was now starting to actually feel a bit angry, which then made me feel worse, as if I were fulfilling some prophecy laid out for me by the haters.\u201d\n\nObama is most revelatory when writing about her 30s; how she continued to grieve the deaths of a dear friend and her beloved father; how she dealt with her own version of the chewed-over \u201cCan I have it all?\u201d dilemma that working mothers face.\n\nShe also shares intimate details for the first time, for instance, that she and her husband had trouble getting pregnant, suffered a miscarriage, and that both daughters were conceived through in vitro fertilization. And that she did a great deal of this while her husband was away serving in the state legislature, leaving her to administer the shots that are a part of that process herself.\n\n[Michelle Obama\u2019s vacation is over. Now she\u2019s claiming her own spotlight]\n\nInevitably, her memoir will be compared to those of other first ladies. Her focus on owning your own unique story sets her book apart, but it is similar to Laura Bush\u2019s in one respect. Both women most deeply excavate the part of their life before the presidency enters.\n\n\u201cI was very surprised, pleasantly surprised, by the level of candor and the level at which she opened herself up,\u201d said Rhimes, who has read memoirs by other first ladies and created a fictional one on her show \u201cScandal.\u201d \u201cI love the honesty and the humor and the beauty with which she addressed the romance of her marriage and the tribulations of her marriage and motherhood, and all of those things that we as women all can relate to.\u201d\n\nObama, for example, describes a lunchtime bliss familiar to many working women raising small children. There were times she left her desk, picked up a fast-food lunch after running errands and sat in her car alone with the radio playing, \u201covercome with relief, impressed with my efficiency.\u201d\n\nThe White House years are the period of time on which Obama has had the least time to reflect. There are moments that she speeds through and others where she recites her methodical approach to planning her first-lady programs, intentionally focusing her \u201cLet\u2019s Move\u201d initiative on children so as to avoid being accused of overreach. She contends that the firewall between the Office of the First Lady and West Wing was solid \u2014 mentioning that her husband called her to the Oval Office only once. That was after the tragic Newtown shootings. They both mourned, and she links the gun violence there to the urban shootings in her hometown and expresses her disbelief regarding the congressional failure to pass gun-control legislature.\n\nAs to her influence on Barack Obama\u2019s policies and plans, there\u2019s no indication that she sought to sway decisions or served as any kind of informal adviser. Instead, family time became sacred; world issues pushed aside in favor of tales from middle school. After their family dinners, he had his briefing books, and she had hers.\n\nThe primary example Obama shares of a clash with the West Wing involved pushing back against her husband\u2019s advisers\u2019 constant concern about optics. Early on in their time at the White House, she plows ahead with a plan to throw a Halloween party for the public and military families despite concern from top West Wing aides \u2014 particularly David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs \u2014 that it would be perceived as too showy in a time of economic decline.\n\nChildren flowed onto the White House grounds, a scene that would be repeated throughout Obama\u2019s tenure as first lady, when she also invited schoolchildren into the East Room for workshops and the Girl Scouts for a campout on the lawn, and many other events.\n\n\u201cAs far as I was concerned, the optics were just right,\u201d she writes of that first party.\n\n\n\nMichelle Obama hosts a roundtable discussion with students at Ballou STAY High School in Washington. (2017 photo by Chuck Kennedy)\n\nThroughout the book, Obama makes it clear that she remained wary of the political press and the public \"gaze\" and felt, at times, bullied, stereotyped and underserved \u2014 particularly during her husband's 2008 campaign.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019d learned anything from the ugliness of the campaign, from the myriad of ways people had sought to write me off as angry or unbecoming, it was that public judgment sweeps in to fill any void. . . . I knew that I would never allow myself to get that banged up again.\u201d\n\nWell before others in the White House, she and her team made use of pop culture, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to push her initiatives, shape her public brand and own her story. She propelled her own popularity.\n\nObama\u2019s carefulness extends to parts of her memoir. There\u2019s a part of herself that she holds back. She has a sacred circle of sister friends who she says kept her grounded in the White House, but she mentions them only briefly. She talks about her mother\u2019s anchoring influence and how raising her own daughters changed her. But she is careful to keep all but the surface details of their lives in Washington private.\n\nHer book, which is being released one week after the midterm elections, will spark conversation as the Democrats look for a standard-bearer for the 2020 general election. She seeks to put an end to calls for her to run for office: \u201cI\u2019ve never been a fan of politics, and my experience over the last ten years has done little to change that. I continue to be put off by the nastiness.\u201d\n\nOf Trump, she adds her \u201cbody buzzed with fury\u201d after hearing the hot-mic tape in which he bragged about grabbing women. \u201cIt was an expression of hatred that had generally been kept out of polite company, but still lived in the marrow of our supposedly enlightened society \u2014 alive and accepted enough that someone like Donald Trump could afford to be cavalier about it.\u201d She tried to block out his election.\n\nObama\u2019s friend and former NPR host Michele Norris, who will soon interview the former first lady at her book tour stop in Boston, says the memoir is about much more than politics; it contains \u201creal-life lessons.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is honest about how difficult it is to make a transition. She\u2019s honest about dealing with people who doubted her or underestimated her,\u201d Norris says. \u201cShe\u2019s honest about the work that goes into relationships of all kinds.\u201d", "When federal investigators were digging into an invention-promotion company accused of fraud by customers, they sought information in 2017 from a prominent member of the company\u2019s advisory board, according to two people familiar with the probe: Matthew G. Whitaker, a former U.S. attorney in Iowa.\n\nIt is unclear how Whitaker \u2014 who was appointed acting attorney general by President Trump on Wednesday \u2014 responded to a Federal Trade Commission subpoena to his law firm.\n\nIn the end, the FTC filed a complaint against Miami-based World Patent Marketing, accusing it of misleading investors and falsely promising that it would help them patent and profit from their inventions, according to court filings.\n\nIn May of this year, a federal court in Florida ordered the company to pay a settlement of more than $25 million and close up shop, records show. The company did not admit or deny wrongdoing.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s sudden elevation this week to replace fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions has put new scrutiny on his involvement with the shuttered company, whose advisory board he joined in 2014, shortly after making a failed run for U.S. Senate in Iowa.\n\nAt the time, he was also running a conservative watchdog group with ties to other powerful nonprofits on the right and was beginning to develop a career as a Trump-friendly cable television commentator.\n\nWorld Patent Marketing \u2014 founded by Miami businessman Scott J. Cooper, who had donated $2,600 to Whitaker\u2019s Senate campaign \u2014 prominently highlighted Whitaker\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as a former U.S. attorney, which helped lend the company credibility.\n\nBut Whitaker seems to have been more than a figurehead. He spoke about inventions of the company\u2019s clients in online videos \u2014 including a special hot-tub seat for people with mobility issues. He also penned a response to at least one complaint \u2014 writing a threatening email in which he cited his role as a former U.S. attorney, according to court filings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really upsetting to know that guy will be attorney general,\u201d said Ryan Masti, 26, who lost $77,000 after paying World Patent Marketing to help him bring to market his idea for a social media app to help the disabled. \u201cIt\u2019s so offensive. It\u2019s like a stab in the back.\u201d\n\nWhitaker did not respond to requests for comment about World Patent Marketing or the investigation. \u201cWe\u2019ll decline,\u201d Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in an email to The Washington Post.\n\nA partner at Whitaker\u2019s former Iowa law firm declined to comment. A spokesman for the FTC also declined to comment.\n\n[In Matthew G. Whitaker, Trump has a loyalist at the helm of the Justice Department]\n\nThere was no evidence that Whitaker knew company salespeople were making false promises to inventors, court receiver Jonathan Perlman said in an interview.\n\n\u201cI have no reason to believe that he knew of any of the wrongdoing,\u201d Perlman said.\n\nWhitaker was paid at least $10,000 by the company, according to court filings.\n\nAt the conclusion of the FTC investigation, Perlman sent a demand letter to Whitaker \u2014 along with other advisory board members \u2014 seeking repayment of the fees they received. Whitaker did not respond, Perlman said.\n\nWhen Whitaker was appointed to the board of World Patent Marketing in October 2014, a company spokesman said in a press release that he would provide \u201cvision and direction.\u201d Later, the company touted Whitaker\u2019s legal background and said he was working with the company to help investors avoid patent marketing fraud.\n\n\u201cAs a former U.S. Attorney, I would only align myself with a first class organization,\u201d Whitaker said in a 2014 company news release. \u201cWorld Patent Marketing goes beyond making statements about doing business \u2018ethically\u2019 and translate those words into action.\u201d\n\nAccording to the FTC, however, the company falsely promised clients it would patent and market their ideas in exchange for hefty fees \u2014 and then pocketed the money.\n\n\u201cFor the last three years, Defendants have operated an invention-promotion scam that has bilked thousands of consumers out of millions of dollars,\u201d the agency alleged in a recently unsealed court filing. \u201cIn truth and in fact, Defendants fail to fulfill almost every promise they make to consumers.\u201d\n\nNeither Cooper nor his current attorney responded to requests for comment.\n\nIn court documents, Cooper told the court that the company did provide some services and said the company\u2019s website warned customers that most inventions are not commercially successful, according to the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Sun-Sentinel.\n\nWorld Patent Marketing salespeople would persuade prospective clients to sign a confidentiality agreement and then ask them to explain their idea, according to court documents.\n\nWhatever the concept, no matter how banal or improbable, investigators found, the salesperson would pronounce the idea fantastic and encourage the customer to pay for a package to market and patent the idea, documents show.\n\nMany people ended up in debt or lost their life savings, according to the FTC.\n\nPromotional material highlighted the meaty r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of board members like Whitaker, which seemed to be a key component of the business operation. The company said the board would help review inventors\u2019 ideas to maximize their ability to get rich.\n\n\u201cInnovators are today\u2019s revolutionaries \u2014 forward-thinking visionaries that have come together to form the powerful and influential World Patent Marketing advisory board,\u201d the narrator of one promotional video intoned, as photos of Whitaker and other board members filled the screen.\n\nMasti, who said he struggled with ADHD as a child and hoped his invention would help others like him, said in an interview that he trusted the company in part because he was told that advisory board members, including Whitaker, had reviewed his idea and thought it would be successful.\n\n\u201cThey said he\u2019s very high up. He\u2019s a professional. He\u2019s got a lot of power,\u201d said Masti, a resident of Cameron, N.Y., who said he voted for Trump in 2016. \u201cThat\u2019s how they sold you.\u201d\n\nNow, Masti said he is living with his parents and facing crushing debt from loans he took out to pay the company.\n\nAnother former customer, Penn Mason, an airline employee from Nashville, said he paid World Patent Marketing $21,000 to help him patent and market a real estate app he had invented.\n\nThe company failed to patent his product and quickly stopped returning his phone calls, he said.\n\nMason said he believes that paid advisory board members like Whitaker essentially pocketed money from unsuspecting victims.\n\n\u201cThat was our money,\u201d said Mason, 52. Of Whitaker\u2019s selection as acting attorney general, he said, \u201cIt makes me sick to my stomach . . . It\u2019s like a punch in the gut.\u201d\n\n[Acting attorney general Whitaker has no intention of recusing from Russia probe, associates say]\n\nWhen investors began to complain that they had paid the company large sums with little to show for it, they were threatened, according to interviews and court documents.\n\nMason said that after he began to complain, he got a call from Cooper, the CEO, who threatened to sue him for slander. \u201cHe really scared me,\u201d Mason said. \u201cYou feel like you\u2019re dealing with all these bigwigs.\u201d\n\nThe Miami New Times, which published in an in-depth investigation of the company last year, reported that Cooper would sometimes tell people who had posted negative reviews of the company that he had security with specialized training in the Israeli martial art Krav Maga.\n\nIn an August 2015 email included in court documents, Whitaker wrote to a complainant who threatened to go to the Better Business Bureau, \u201cI am assuming you understand that there could be serious civil and criminal consequences for you.\u201d He noted he was a former U.S. attorney.\n\nAnother board member, Aileen M. Marty, a professor of infectious disease at Florida International University in Miami, said she was told when she joined the board that she would be sent interesting patent ideas to review \u2014 but never received any.\n\nMarty said she received one check for her board service, which she returned when she heard the company could be committing fraud.\n\n\u201cI wish I had never heard of the company and I wish that my name were not in any way associated with it. I can\u2019t turn back time and not accept the offer to be on their board \u2014 believe me if I could, I would,\u201d she said in an email to The Post.\n\nAs he was advising World Patent Marketing, Whitaker ran a conservative watchdog group called the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust. The group lodged numerous ethics complaints and calls for investigations, targeting Hillary Clinton and Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, as well as some Republicans.\n\nOn its website, FACT lists a downtown Washington address. But it is one of some 200 \u201cvirtual members\u201d who use a K Street location to claim a presence in the nation\u2019s capital, according to Brian Bullock, assistant general manager of Carr Workplaces, the firm that operates the site.\n\n\u201cThey only come in every six months or so,\u201d Bullock said. \u201cWe pretty much just accept their mail.\u201d\n\nFACT was formed in 2014 with a large donation from another tax-exempt charity that has served as a fountainhead of cash for organizations affiliated with the conservative movement \u2014 an arrangement that helps further mask the identity of donors.\n\nThe group received more than $1 million in recent years from a donor-advised fund called Donors Trust Inc., which is a source of funding for scores of other conservative groups, including Judicial Watch, Project Veritas, the Claremont Institute, the Federalist Society and the David Horowitz Freedom Center, tax filings show.\n\nWhitaker received $402,000 in 2016 as FACT\u2019s president and director \u2014 nearly a third of the donations the group received that year, according to its tax filings. He received $252,000 in 2015, more than half the charity\u2019s receipts that year, tax filings show.\n\nFACT officials declined to comment, but they described the group as a nonpartisan ethics watchdog that holds accountable government officials from both parties.\n\nAlice Crites and Tom Hamburger contributed to this report.", "South Korean firefighters check the site of a fire in Seoul, South Korea, Friday, Nov. 9, 2018. A fire at a low-cost dormitory-style housing facility in central Seoul killed several people on Friday, fire authorities said. (Hong Hae-in/Yonhap via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 A fire that likely blocked a crucial exit at a low-cost dormitory-style housing facility in central Seoul killed at least seven people and injured 11 others on Friday, according to fire authorities who were investigating possible safety lapses in the building.\n\nThe blaze has been extinguished, but it\u2019s possible that the death toll could rise, officials at the Seoul Metropolitan Fire and Disaster Headquarters said.\n\nThe fire probably started near an exit door on the building\u2019s third floor, Kwon Hyeok-min, chief of Seoul\u2019s Jongno District Fire Station, told reporters. The facility\u2019s residents were mostly manual laborers who made their living on day-to-day jobs, he said.\n\n\u201cIt was dawn and the exit door was likely blocked, so it would have been difficult (for the residents) to escape,\u201d Kwon said.\n\nAnother official from the Jongno station said the facility, which was built in 1983, did not have sprinklers because current safety regulations can\u2019t be retroactively applied to older structures. The official, who didn\u2019t want to be named, citing office rules, said it was unclear whether the building\u2019s smoke detector worked.\n\nThe facility, called \u201cgoshiwon\u201d in Korean, is where poor workers relying on construction jobs or student preparing for bar exams or civil service exams stay in individual rooms with tiny sleep and study spaces. Budget travelers also often stay in such facilities.\n\nSouth Korean media reported that most of the victims were manual laborers in their 40s to 60s. The fire agency couldn\u2019t immediately confirm the reports. It wasn\u2019t known whether any young students or travelers were staying there.\n\nThe facility was located on the second and third floors of a three-story building, where the fire agency said all the victims were found. Its first floor has restaurants.\n\nSouth Korea, one of Asia\u2019s richest economies, has struggled for decades to improve safety standards and change widespread attitudes that treat safety as subservient to economic progress and convenience.\n\nForty-six people died in January when a fire ripped through a small hospital with no sprinkler systems in the southern city of Miryang. It was the country\u2019s worst fire since 2008, when 40 people died at a refrigerated warehouse in Icheon, near Seoul. Twenty-nine people were killed in a building fire in Jecheon in December of last year.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

She writes that they met with a counselor \u201ca handful of times,\u201d and she came to realize that she was more \u201cin charge\u201d of her happiness than she had realized. \u201cThis was my pivot point,\u201d Obama explains. \u201cMy moment of self-arrest.\u201d\n\nObama writes that she assumed Trump was \u201cgrandstanding\u201d when he announced his presidential run in 2015.

She writes lovingly of her family and gives a detailed account of her courtship with her future husband, whom she met when both were at the Chicago law firm Sidley Austin LLP; she was initially his adviser. Secretaries claimed he was both brilliant and \u201ccute,\u201d although Michelle Obama was skeptical, writing that white people went \u201cbonkers\u201d any time you \u201cput a suit\u201d on a \u201chalf-intelligent black man.\u201d She also thought his picture had a \u201cwhiff of geekiness.\u201d\n\nBut she was more than impressed after meeting him, by his \u201crich, even sexy baritone\u201d and by his \u201cstrange, stirring combination\u201d of serenity and power. \u201cThis strange mix-of-everything-man,\u201d when she finally let him kiss her, set off a \u201ctoppling blast of lust, gratitude, fulfillment, wonder.\u201d\n\nBut throughout her husband\u2019s life in politics, she fought to balance public and private needs, and to maintain her self-esteem. She agonized over what she feared was a cartoonish, racist image. She remembered being labeled \u201cangry\u201d and, by the Fox network, \u201cObama\u2019s Baby Mama.\u201d At times, she feared she was damaging her husband\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, especially after conservatives seized on a line from one of her speeches \u2014 taken out of context, she notes \u2014 that for the first time as an adult she was \u201creally proud\u201d of her country.\n\nThe remarks faded from the news, but she sensed lasting damage, a \u201cpernicious seed,\u201d a \u201cperception\u201d that she was \u201cdisgruntled and vaguely hostile.\u201d\n\nAs the first black first lady, she knew she would be labeled \u201cother\u201d and would have to earn the aura of \u201cgrace\u201d given freely to her white predecessors. She found confidence in repeating to herself a favorite chant: \u201cAm I good enough?

The rallies were part of her work as co-chairman of the nonpartisan, nonprofit organization When We All Vote.\n\nLast month, she launched a program to help empower girls worldwide through education. The Global Girls Alliance aims to support more than 1,500 grassroots organizations combating the challenges girls encounter in their communities.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show Mrs. Obama launched the program last month, not last year.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

A decade after the North-South experiment in tourism cooperation in Kumgang ended in bitter failure following the fatal shooting of a South Korean tourist in 2008, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in want to give it another try amid opposition from Washington. (Dita Alangkara/Associated Press)\n\nMOUNT KUMGANG, North Korea \u2014 The two-lane highway south from North Korea\u2019s Mount Kumgang into and across the Demilitarized Zone is lined by tall green fences and street lamps that are only turned on for special occasions. Children play on a parallel stretch of railroad that hasn\u2019t been in regular use since before they were born. Behind a solitary guard stands a sign saying it\u2019s 68 kilometers (40 miles) to Sokcho, a town just across the DMZ in South Korea.\n\nAt the height of South Korea\u2019s policy of engagement with the North, the \u201cDiamond Mountain Resort\u201d area was a symbol of cooperation. More than 2 million South Korean tourists came to visit and some of the South\u2019s biggest corporations poured more than a billion dollars into what they hoped would be a world-class travel destination.\n\nToday it\u2019s almost deserted.\n\nA decade after the North-South experiment in cooperation on Kumgang ended in bitter failure, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in want to give it another try. By the end of the year they hope to begin working on opening this stretch of road and rail.\n\nThe push to jointly develop Kumgang is a direct challenge to Washington\u2019s policy of maintaining sanctions and \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d until Pyongyang gives up its nuclear arsenal.\n\n___\n\nChrystal chandeliers hang from the ceiling of the Kumgangsan Hotel, where a handful of North Korean tourists in Adidas sweatsuits gathers to catch a bus up the mountain. Elaborate murals of mountain scenery cover the walls of its second floor. In the cavernous lobby, there\u2019s a souvenir shop, a white concert piano on a stage beside billiard and pingpong tables and a well-stocked bar. There\u2019s a theater and a karaoke room.\n\nThe hotel is eerily silent, the quiet broken only by the occasional laughter of the local tourists and some scattered Chinese groups.\n\nBuilt in the 1990s with hundreds of millions of dollars of South Korean investment, mostly from a branch of the Hyundai Group, the resort was in its heyday an oasis of luxury, with conga lines and Filipino lounge bands. Its 10 hotels featured opulent fixtures and oil paintings framed in gold. Guests had the run of an 18-hole golf course, now closed, and a hot springs spa, which remains open and popular with North Koreans. Today, the resort\u2019s main role is to be the official venue for reunions of families divided by the 1950-53 Korean War.\n\nThe Kumgang project was troubled from its outset, when it opened to South Koreans in 1998.\n\nVisitors from the South were allowed only day trips or visits of a few days. Initially they were brought in by ferry to minimize chances to see the North\u2019s countryside or interact with its people. Later, they were allowed in on buses through the DMZ, with the curtains drawn until they had arrived.\n\nThe resort drew only a fraction of the 500,000 tourists projected to come annually. Within a few years of its opening, it was hemorrhaging money.\n\nIts fate was sealed in July 2008, when a North Korean soldier shot dead tourist Park Wang-ja, a 53-year-old housewife from Seoul, after she allegedly wandered into a restricted area on a beach on the resort\u2019s fringes. Seoul quickly suspended all travel to Kumgang. In 2011, the North announced it was seizing all assets and taking back control of all real estate rights.\n\nThe Hyundai affiliate is believed to have lost more than a billion dollars. Its Kumgang office sits padlocked and unoccupied near an arena that once housed a circus.\n\n___\n\nFrom their first summit in April, reopening the road and railway across the DMZ to Kumgang has been a top priority for Moon and Kim.\n\nMoon has helped bring Kim out of the cold. He wants to expand economic ties with the North to build trust and defuse tensions, creating conditions for Kim to dismantle his nuclear arsenal. He also hopes to reopen another \u201cSunshine\u201d era symbol, the jointly operated Kaesong industrial complex on the North\u2019s side of the DMZ.\n\nAt their third summit, in September, Kim and Moon formalized Mount Kumgang\u2019s role as the reunion venue, agreeing to \u201cpromptly restore the facility toward this end.\u201d Their joint statement included plans for a ground-breaking ceremony for work to reopen cross-border railways and roads, including the ones near Kumgang, by the year\u2019s end and to \u201cnormalize\u201d the Kaesong industrial complex and Mount Kumgang tourism projects when the time is ripe.\n\nMoon\u2019s seeming readiness to scale back sanctions even before Pyongyang takes major steps to denuclearize is raising red flags in Washington. Such concerns spiked when South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha suggested Seoul might lift unilateral sanctions it imposed after an 2010 attack on a South Korean warship that killed 46 sailors.\n\nTrump\u2019s response was quick and, to many Koreans, deeply insulting.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t do that without our approval,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do nothing without our approval.\u201d\n\nLim Soo-ho of the Seoul-based Institute for National Security said it\u2019s all but impossible for South Korea to resume joint tours to Kumgang, operations at the Kaesong joint factory park or any other form of economic cooperation under the current international sanctions, which have strengthened significantly since 2016. Washington\u2019s own sanctions against Pyongyang restrict an even broader range of economic activities and target a larger list of companies and individuals.\n\nSouth Korea will never abandon the Kumgang joint tours or Kaesong factory park because they are such powerful symbols of inter-Korean cooperation, Lim said. But a less risky business environment for southern companies is needed, perhaps with a free trade agreement that would bring inter-Korean economic activities closer to global standards.\n\nFor now, ground-breaking ceremonies for projects not yet started are the best Seoul and Pyongyang can manage.\n\n___\n\nA special permit is required to get to the beach from the base of the mountains.\n\nWinding through freshly harvested farmland, the rice still spread out on the roadsides to dry, travelers come to an imposing checkpoint manned by armed soldiers. A tall, electrified fence marks the entrance into the DMZ.\n\nPae Un Sim was a child during Kumgang\u2019s boom years.\n\nLeading the way down a gravel path to the rugged beach where the South Korean housewife was killed, she recalls meeting a tourist who said he once told everyone Yosemite National Park in the United States was the most beautiful mountain scenery in the world. He had to revise that after seeing the Alps, and again after seeing Kumgang.\n\nThe sun is setting. Lights along the North-South demarcation line can be seen flickering in the hills.\n\nPae stops to point to the ocean.\n\n\u201cIf you look between those two little islands, you can see the South,\u201d she said. \u201cThere used to be so many tourists. It was very lively.\u201d\n\nAsked about her impressions of the South Koreans who came to visit or her hopes for the future, she hesitated. Those topics are still perhaps too sensitive and too political to discuss freely. After some thought she voiced a commonly heard refrain.\n\n\u201cWe Koreans are one people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is our common wish to be reunited.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP reporter Tong-hyung Kim contributed to this story from Seoul.

About 500 Central American migrants headed out of Mexico City on Friday to embark on the longest and most dangerous leg of their journey to the U.S. border, while thousands more were waiting one day more at the stadium. (Rodrigo Abd/Associated Press)\n\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 About 750 Central American migrants headed out of Mexico City on Friday to embark on the longest and most dangerous leg of their journey to the U.S. border, while thousands more were waiting one more day at a massive improvised shelter.\n\nThe group that got a head start bundled their few possessions and started off, taking a subway to the north part of the city and then hiking down an expressway with a police escort.\n\nFor many, it was the first time they had ever been in a metro system, and they had little knowledge of the city or the 1,740 mile (2,800 kilometer) route to Tijuana that lay ahead of them.\n\nCarlos Castanaza, a 29-year-old plumber from Guatemala City, wrapped himself from head to toe in a blanket against the cold and asked bystanders where the first toll booth was. When told it was in a town about 20 miles (30 kilometers) away, he carefully wrote the name of the town on his hand with a pen to remember where he was going.\n\nDeported for driving without a license after a decade working in Connecticut, Castanaza was desperate to get back to his two U.S.-born children. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to get back for more than a year, but I couldn\u2019t until the caravan came through,\u201d said Castanaza. \u201cThat\u2019s why I joined the caravan.\u201d\n\nThe advanced group hoped to reach the north-central city of Queretaro, about 105 miles (170 kilometers) to the northwest, by nightfall.\n\nMeanwhile, another 4,000 to 5,000 migrants milled around the massive shelter improvised at a Mexico City sports complex, impatient to leave.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go!\u201d shouted Eddy Rivera, 37, a rail-thin migrant from Honduras who said he couldn\u2019t take staying in the camp any longer. \u201cWe are all sick, from the humidity and the cold,\u201d said Rivera, who left behind four children and a wife in Honduras. \u201cWe have to get going, we have to get to Tijuana.\u201d\n\nThough he was unsure how an unskilled farmworker like himself would be allowed in the United States, he had a simple dream: earn enough money to build a little house for his family back in Puerto Cortes, Honduras.\n\nThousands of migrants have spent the past few days resting, receiving medical attention and debating how to proceed with their arduous trek through Central America and Mexico which began in mid-October. On Thursday, caravan representatives met with officials from the local United Nations office and demanded buses to take them to the border, saying the trek would be too hard and dangerous for walking and hitchhiking.\n\nCaravan coordinator Milton Benitez said officials had offered them buses for women and children but organizers demanded that they be for everyone. By Friday, the migrants said they were so angry at the U.N.\u2019s lack of help that they no longer wanted U.N. observers with the caravan.\n\nThe United Nations on Friday denied the offer, releasing a statement saying its agencies \u201care unable to provide the transportation demanded by some members of the caravan.\u201d\n\nThe migrants made a big point of sticking together, their only form of self-protection.\n\nFelix Rodriguez, 35, of Choluteca, Honduras had been at the Mexico City sports complex for more than a week.\n\n\u201cWe all want to get moving,\u201d he said. But he was waiting for the main group to leave Saturday, noting \u201cit is better to leave in a group, because leaving in small bunches is dangerous.\u201d\n\nMexico City is more than 600 miles from the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas, but the area around the Mexican border cities of Reynosa, Matamoros and Nuevo Laredo is so rife with drug gangs that the migrants consider it too dangerous to risk.\n\nA previous caravan in the spring opted for the longer route to Tijuana in the far northwest, across from San Diego. That caravan steadily dwindled to only about 200 people by the time it reached the border.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is the longest route but is the best border, while Texas is the closest but the worst\u201d border, said Jose Luis Fuentes of the National Lawyers Guild.\n\nMexico has offered refuge, asylum or work visas to the migrants, and its government said 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them while they wait for the 45-day application process for a more permanent status. On Wednesday, a bus left from Mexico City to return 37 people to their countries of origin.\n\nBut many want to continue on toward the United States.\n\nAuthorities say most have refused offers to stay in Mexico, and only a small number have agreed to return to their home countries. About 85 percent of the migrants are from Honduras, while others are from the Central American countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

But his wife was there, and according to Carlson, she locked herself in the pantry and called 911 out of fear of a home invasion.\n\n\u201cTucker Carlson, we are outside your home,\u201d one person can be heard saying in a video of the incident that was posted to social media and has since been deleted. The person accuses Carlson of \u201cpromoting hate\u201d and \u201can ideology that has led to thousands of people dying.\u201d\n\nThe protesters were scattering by the time police arrived. No one was arrested and the confrontation, which is thought to have involved about 20 people, is being investigated as a suspected hate crime, according to a police report.\n\nSmash Racism DC, the anti-fascist group that helped organize the protest, was unapologetic Thursday, writing on Facebook: \u201cFascists are vulnerable. Confront them at their homes!\u201d\n\nIn the post, which has since been deleted, the group said Carlson and other conservative pundits, along with President Trump, have fanned hatred and created an atmosphere that encourages political violence such as the recent mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, an argument Trump and his allies have rejected. \u201cFascist pundits who promote violence deserve no peace,\u201d it said on Facebook.\n\n\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson poses in this March 2017 file photo. (Richard Drew/AP)\n\nIn June, amid national debate over the separation of migrant children from their parents at the southern U.S. border, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was heckled as she ate at a Mexican restaurant in D.C. In September, in an episode Smash Racism DC also helped organize, protesters shouted Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and his wife out of an upscale restaurant, castigating the lawmaker for supporting the nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe confrontations have drawn criticism from figures across much of the political spectrum and provided grist for Republicans who have characterized the left as an angry mob.\n\nCarlson was at his desk at Fox News when he received multiple text messages from neighbors about a commotion outside his home.\n\n\u201cI called my wife,\u201d Carlson told The Washington Post. \u201cShe had been in the kitchen alone getting ready to go to dinner and she heard pounding on the front door and screaming. . . . Someone started throwing himself against the front door and actually cracked the front door.\u201d\n\nThe police report does not mention damage to the front door. It says Carlson\u2019s wife \u201cretreated to a room in the rear of her home\u201d after hearing loud banging and pounding on the door. Officers found an anarchy symbol spray-painted on the driveway, according to the police report.\n\nThe report describes the incident as a suspected hate crime with \u201canti-political\u201d bias. Police have stepped up their presence in the neighborhood as they continue investigating the incident, spokesman Dustin Sternbeck said.\n\nCarlson said the protesters had blocked off both ends of his street and carried signs that listed his home address. A woman was also overheard in one of the deleted videos saying she wanted to \u201cbring a pipe bomb\u201d to his house, he said.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a protest. It was a threat,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t protesting anything specific that I had said. They weren\u2019t asking me to change anything. They weren\u2019t protesting a policy or advocating for legislation. . . . They were threatening me and my family and telling me to leave my own neighborhood in the city that I grew up in.\u201d\n\nOne of the protesters told The Post the group did not intend to be violent and did not attempt to break into Carlson\u2019s home. The protester, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation, said that the group wanted to make Carlson uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cThe reason for this tactic is to bring the pain that is felt every day among marginalized people who have been victim of right-wing politics to Tucker and make it personal,\u201d the protester said. \u201cHe has explicitly made far-right politics go mainstream. That is what he has done with his television show and platform.\u201d\n\nThe person said the group did not plan to protest in front of Carlson\u2019s home in the dark, but failed to account for last weekend\u2019s daylight saving time change.\n\nHe said Trump and others on the right consistently describe protests by anyone on the left as violent and out of control, whatever the facts \u2014 so the group is unconcerned if their more extreme tactics make Democrats look bad.\n\nCarlson\u2019s home address, as well as the addresses of his brother and good friend Neil Patel, with whom he co-founded the conservative media site the Daily Caller, were shared in tweets from Smash Racism DC\u2019s account after the protest.\n\nOn Twitter, Smash Racism DC also accused Carlson of spreading \u201cfear into our homes\u201d every night, taking particular issue with his comments about the caravan of migrants who are traveling through Mexico on their way to the United States.\n\n\u201cTonight you\u2019re reminded that we have a voice,\u201d a now-deleted tweet from the group read. \u201cTonight, we remind you that you are not safe either.\u201d\n\nFollowing backlash and news reports, Twitter deleted the tweets and suspended the group\u2019s account early Thursday morning. The Facebook video was also taken down, but the group\u2019s page is still up.\n\nThe \u201cdoxing\u201d of Carlson \u2014 the revealing of his personal information on the Internet \u2014 and the subsequent protest at his home prompted widespread condemnation from a range of news and media figures.\n\nFox News senior political analyst Brit Hume decried it as \u201crevolting, and frightening.\u201d\n\nS.E. Cupp, a CNN host, wrote on Twitter that the activists\u2019 actions were \u201cnot okay,\u201d adding, \u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d\n\nWashington Post columnist Max Boot, who has been critical of Carlson, also spoke out. \u201cI think Tucker is a terrible influence on modern America but that doesn\u2019t justify harassing him at home,\u201d Boot tweeted. \u201cGo high, not low.\u201d", "Columnist\n\nWhen confronting bad news these days, many tend to assume that it\u2019s just a bump on the road and that things will work out. President Barack Obama was fond of invoking the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\u201d Yet could we be wrong in assuming that, despite some backsliding here and there, forward movement is inexorable?\n\nOn Sunday \u2014 at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month \u2014 we will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of the largest and bloodiest conflict the world had ever seen. World War I marked a turning point in human history \u2014 the end of four massive European empires, the rise of Soviet communism and the entry of the United States into global-power politics. But perhaps its most significant intellectual legacy was the end of the idea of inevitable progress.\n\nIn 1914, before the war began, people had lived through a world much like ours, defined by heady economic growth, technological revolutions and increasing globalization. The result was that it was widely believed that ugly trend lines, when they appeared, were temporary, to be overwhelmed by the onward march of progress. In 1909, Norman Angell wrote a book explaining that war between the major powers was so costly as to be unimaginable. \u201cThe Great Illusion\u201d became an international bestseller, and Angell became a cult celebrity (and was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize). Just a few years after the book was published, a generation of Europeans was destroyed in the carnage of war.\n\nCould we be similarly complacent today? There are serious statesmen who believe so. During a recent interview, French President Emmanuel Macron explained, \u201cIn a Europe that is divided by fears, nationalist assertion and the consequences of the economic crisis, we see almost methodically the rearticulation of everything that dominated the life of Europe from post-World War I to the 1929 [economic] crisis.\u201d And, during an address earlier this year to the European Parliament, Macron said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to belong to a generation of sleepwalkers that has forgotten its own past.\u201d As historian Christopher Clark wrote in his book \u201cThe Sleepwalkers,\u201d the statesmen of 1914 stumbled into a gruesome world war without ever realizing the magnitude or dangers of their isolated, incremental decisions \u2014 or non-decisions. Macron is not simply talking; he has organized a Paris Peace Forum of more than 60 world leaders, set to begin this Sunday, to try to combat the dangers of rising nationalism and eroding global cooperation.\n\nAre these dangers so real and pressing? If you compare the world today, it does feel less like the 1930s than it does the 1920s. Economic growth and technological progress were accelerating then, as now. We are also seeing a surge in nationalism and the breakdown of cooperation, which were hallmarks of the 1920s. New great powers were ascending, as they are now. Democracies were under strain from demagogues, such as in Italy, where Mussolini destroyed liberal institutions and established control. And amid all this was the growth of populism, racism and anti-Semitism, which were used to divide countries and exclude various minorities as outside of the \u201creal nation.\u201d Of course, because of the pressures of the 1920s, we got the 1930s.\n\nToday\u2019s trends are all connected. Economic growth, globalization and technology have given rise to new centers of power, within nations and in the world at large. This is an age of big winners and big losers. The pace of change makes people anxious that their countries and cultures are changing \u2014 throughout the world. And they find comfort in strongmen who promise to protect them.\n\nThe historian Timothy Snyder makes a distinction in his new book \u201cThe Road to Unfreedom\u201d between what he calls \u201cthe politics of inevitability\u201d \u2014 the sanguine faith that it\u2019s all going to work out \u2014 and \u201cthe politics of eternity.\u201d The latter is the view, held by leaders such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, that nothing is inevitable, that through force, cunning, strength and will, you can bend, or even reverse, the arc of history. Snyder describes how Putin did just that in Ukraine, refusing to accept that it was inevitably joining hands with the West, and launching a relentless series of moves that have dismembered Ukraine and mired it in a seemingly endless internal conflict.\n\nPutin may not win. The efforts of people like him to reverse the progress of the past might not work. But it will take more effort from those on the other side. Things are not simply going to work themselves out while we watch. History is not a Hollywood movie.\n\nRead more from Fareed Zakaria\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his daily newsletter.", "Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg leaves the stage after speaking to first-year students at Georgetown Law in Washington in September.

Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in an interview. \u201cBut the court is susceptible to illness or death for openings on the part of any of them. And we need to be aware and wary about the potential imminence of another opening.\u201d\n\nHow long Ginsburg will remain on the court has been the topic of quiet speculation among leaders of both parties in recent years. The liberal jurist turned aside calls on the left to retire when President Barack Obama could name her successor and has said she wants to work until she\u2019s at least 90.\n\nShe has battled two forms of cancer without missing a day of the court\u2019s work and underwent a heart procedure in 2014. This is the third time Ginsburg has broken ribs.\n\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway told reporters Thursday that Trump and others at the White House were wishing Ginsburg a full and speedy recovery. \u201cWe\u2019re praying for her, and we know how tough she is,\u201d Conway said.\n\nAfter a polarizing confirmation fight, the Senate last month narrowly confirmed Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who denied allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in high school and college. Kavanaugh succeeded Anthony M. Kennedy, a crucial swing vote on the court. A departure by Ginsburg or Breyer would enable Trump to push the ideology of the court even further right.\n\nStill seething from Kavanaugh\u2019s contentious confirmation, Democrats are expected to face stiffer head winds when it comes to the federal judiciary next year. Although Republicans lost control of the House in Tuesday\u2019s midterm election, they held their majority in the Senate with wins by staunch Trump allies.\n\n\u201cThis is a mandate to move full speed ahead,\u201d said Carrie Severino, chief counsel at the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative group.\n\nThe Senate has sole responsibility for confirming federal judges, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has taken full advantage during the Trump presidency. In addition to installing Kavanaugh and Justice Neil M. Gorsuch on the high court, the Senate has confirmed 29 appellate judges, the most during a president\u2019s first two years, and 53 district court judges.\n\nBeginning next year, McConnell and Trump will likely have more breathing room, after picking up seats in Missouri, Indiana and North Dakota. They were working with a 51-49 majority during the Kavanaugh fight, leaving them with almost no margin for error.\n\nModerate Democratic Sens. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) and Joe Donnelly (Ind.), who voted against Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, will be replaced by Rep. Kevin Cramer (N.D.) and businessman Mike Braun, strong Trump backers who ran on Democratic opposition to Kavanaugh and the importance of confirming judges.\n\nIn Missouri, Sen. Claire McCaskill (D), who voted against both of Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominees, will be replaced by state Attorney General Josh Hawley (R). Hawley ran aggressively against the Democratic resistance to Kavanaugh.\n\nRepublicans may gain another seat in Florida, where the race is still too close to call. Arizona, which Democrats are looking to flip, is also still too close to call. Democrats did pick up one Republican-held seat, in Nevada.\n\nRepublicans are favored to hold a seat in Mississippi in a runoff later this month. If they do, they will ensure a majority of at least 52 members, regardless of what happens in the other outstanding contests.\n\nPart of any calculation for McConnell were moderate Republican Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), both supporters of abortion rights. With more conservative Republicans in the Senate, and Vice President Pence able to break a tie, the votes of Collins and Murkowski will matter less.\n\nTrump and Senate GOP leaders said they believe Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation in the face of impassioned Democratic opposition propelled their candidates to victory. They are expected to keep up an aggressive pace of filling the courts in the new year.\n\n\u201cYou know what my top priority is. I\u2019ve made it very clear. It\u2019s the judiciary,\u201d McConnell said Wednesday.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) accused Republicans of being determined to pack the courts with judges hostile to women, health-care protections and gun control laws. \u201cIn the long run, it\u2019s going to hurt them far more,\u201d he said of the GOP.\n\nSenators will return to work next week for the first time since the midterms. Part of their business in the weeks ahead will be figuring out committee assignments and chairmanships. Among the biggest question marks is who will head the Judiciary Committee, which is tasked with holding hearings on Supreme Court nominees.\n\nSen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the current chairman, is deciding whether he wants to continue helming the panel or lead the Finance Committee. He is second in line on Finance, which is chaired by retiring Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah).\n\n\u201cSen. Grassley will consult with his colleagues when the Senate returns next week and will then announce his decision,\u201d said his spokesman, Michael Zona.\n\nIf Grassley opts for the Finance post, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) is in line to head the Judiciary Committee. A onetime Trump critic and presidential rival, Graham has transformed himself into one of the president\u2019s most vocal champions on Capitol Hill. He furiously lashed out at Democrats during a hearing in which Kavanaugh testified.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee will also be tasked with examining Trump\u2019s eventual nominee to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who resigned Wednesday at the president\u2019s request. Graham and Trump discussed the opening Thursday in the Oval Office, the senator said.\n\nGraham also joined Trump at Kavanaugh\u2019s formal investiture at the Supreme Court on Thursday.\n\nRobert Barnes and John Wagner contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said Thursday that North Korea canceled this week\u2019s talks between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a senior North Korean official, but a meeting between the two nations\u2019 leaders is still on for after Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there was some major issue\u201d for the postponement, she said. \u201cI have talked with the administration and basically what we\u2019re looking at is they postponed it because they weren\u2019t ready.\u201d\n\nPompeo was supposed to meet with Kim Yong Chol in New York on Thursday to discuss the North\u2019s commitment to eliminating its nuclear weapons and arrangements for a second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\n\u201cI do think the talks are going to be rescheduled,\u201d Haley said of the Pompeo-Kim Yong Chol meeting. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t change the fact that that summit is still scheduled for the president and Kim to meet after the first of the year.\u201d\n\nHaley spoke to reporters ahead of U.N. Security Council closed consultations called by Russia to discuss exemptions from U.N. sanctions on North Korea.\n\n\u201cWe have given a lot of carrots up until now,\u201d she said, pointing to the Kim-Trump summit in Singapore and follow-up meetings as well as stopping military exercises.\n\nWhile there haven\u2019t been any nuclear or ballistic missile tests by North Korea, Haley said its government hasn\u2019t allowed inspectors into its nuclear and missile facilities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to get rid of the stick because they haven\u2019t done anything to warrant getting rid of the sanctions yet,\u201d she said.\n\nHaley accused Russia of trying to \u201cearn brownie points with North Korea and I think they are also just trying to go ahead and talk about lifting sanctions because they\u2019re already cheating.\u201d\n\nShe accused Russia of bringing in North Korean laborers and providing Pyongyang with refined petroleum, in violation of U.N. sanctions. And she added: \u201cWe know they\u2019ve been doing some things with the financial aspect of it.\u201d\n\nAs she left the closed council meeting, Haley said humanitarian exemptions were discussed.\n\nShe said earlier that the U.S. goal is to make sure aid goes to people in need, not the regime, so it is investigating technical aspects of a number of requests to make sure aid is not re-routed.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re going to take our time to do that,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Haley said Russia\u2019s real aim came out at the end of the council consultations.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re looking for is to lift banking restrictions, which are exactly some of the things we know they\u2019re not following through on appropriately,\u201d Haley said. \u201cSo now we know what their agenda is.

But how far is it willing to go to make its case that the reporter acted improperly during a news conference with President Trump?\n\nOne answer emerged Wednesday night when White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted a video of the episode, involving CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta, the network\u2019s chief White House correspondent. Experts said the video, in which Acosta is seen rebuffing a press aide\u2019s attempt to take a microphone out of his hands, was altered to exaggerate the aggressiveness of Acosta\u2019s actions.\n\nIf that is the case, the video may belong in a category rarely employed by democratic governments: visual propaganda.\n\nThe White House video, apparently made by a contributor to the conspiracy-peddling website Infowars , speeds up the movement of Acosta\u2019s arms as the unidentified aide grabs at the mic during a heated conversation between the reporter and Trump. The video tweeted by Sanders also eliminated Acosta\u2019s comment to the young woman \u2014 \u201cPardon me, ma\u2019am\u201d \u2014 as he sought to continue questioning the president.\n\nOn Thursday, Sanders offered no apologies. \u201cThe question is: Did the reporter make contact or not?\u201d she asked reporters a day after the White House revoked Acosta\u2019s press credentials for his alleged transgression. \u201cThe video is clear, he did. We stand by our statement.\u201d\n\nThe White House\u2019s actions and account of them has drawn widespread condemnation, particularly from journalists and news organizations. The White House News Photographers Association, among others, said it was appalled by Sanders\u2019s video.\n\n\u201cAs visual journalists, we know that manipulating images is manipulating truth,\u201d said the group\u2019s president, Whitney Shefte, a Washington Post videographer. \u201cIt\u2019s deceptive, dangerous and unethical. Knowingly sharing manipulated images is equally problematic, particularly when the person sharing them is a representative of our country\u2019s highest office with vast influence over public opinion.\u201d\n\nTotalitarian governments have long recognized the value of altering photos and videos to manipulate public opinion and perception. Officials were regularly airbrushed out of state photos in the Soviet Union as dictators such as Joseph Stalin purged internal enemies. Wartime governments regularly censor images or release them selectively to maintain popular order and morale.\n\nModern-day regimes vigorously employ digital techniques to fool viewers; North Korea\u2019s propaganda ministry routinely alters images emanating from the isolated nation, from photos of leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s ears to state-issued pictures of the country\u2019s military prowess.\n\nSuch tactics have been irregularly employed in democracies like the United States, too. Political campaigns are rife with fake images. During his red-baiting campaign of the early 1950s, Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy (R-Wis.) distributed doctored photos of his opponents to suggest communist sympathies, according to Boston University journalism professor Christopher Daly. One \u201ccomposite\u201d photograph appeared to show Sen. Millard Tydings (D-Md.) deep in conversation with the head of the American Communist Party.\n\nOne of the most notorious instances of deliberate image ma\u00adnipu\u00adla\u00adtion by the White House, said Daly, was its presentation of photos of the Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964. The photos, apparently showing a minor naval skirmish, helped persuade Congress to pass a resolution granting President Lyndon B. Johnson the authority to provide greater military assistance to the government of South Vietnam.\n\nNews organizations disapprove of altering photos and videos, on the premise that doing so deceives readers and viewers. News photos are cropped to better frame the action in them, and videos are edited to enhance clarity and storytelling \u2014 all considered legitimate practices. But some images are unethically altered. Judges in the annual World Press Photo competition have regularly disqualified entries because of \u201cexcessive\u201d post-processing, such as toning that removes or hides objects in a photo.\n\nAmong the most infamous examples of news-photo ma\u00adnipu\u00adla\u00adtion were National Geographic\u2019s shot of the Egyptian pyramids, \u201csqueezed\u201d together to fit on the magazine\u2019s cover in 1982, and Time magazine\u2019s cover image of O.J. Simpson in 1994. Time darkened Simpson\u2019s image, making him look more sinister and menacing.\n\nWhile Sanders\u2019s Acosta tweet doesn\u2019t rise to Gulf of Tonkin levels, it raises several troubling questions, said Emmett Sullivan, who lectures in modern history and imagemaking at the University of London. He said that the video she distributed is identical to one by Paul Joseph Watson, a conspiracy theorist affiliated with Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars site.\n\n\u201cThe issue is then not one of manipulation, but simply judgment in sourcing your information,\u201d said Sullivan. \u201cWhy not use the C-SPAN feed directly? America can expect the president\u2019s press secretary to cite the best sources, and Sarah Sanders has failed the American people here.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet on Thursday, Watson disputed that his video was altered: \u201cThe media, with zero fact checking, launched a conspiracy claiming I \u2018sped up\u2019 or \u2018doctored\u2019 the Jim Acosta video so they could distract from Acosta\u2019s behavior. This is false. I did not \u2018doctor\u2019 or \u2018speed up\u2019 anything. It was all fake news.\u201d\n\nAcosta, who has tangled often with the White House and Trump, tweeted that Sanders\u2019s claim that he put his hands on the press aide was \u201ca lie.\u201d\n\nSullivan says governments are less likely than ever to knowingly pass off a fake. The reason: \u201cIt is simply too easy for the manipulation to be spotted now. It generates too much adverse publicity in the media and social media precisely because video is such a common medium of communication.\u201d\n\nThen again, technology has created a kind of \u201carms race\u201d between tools that permit video and photo ma\u00adnipu\u00adla\u00adtion and those designed to sniff out the fakes, said Hany Farid, a professor of computer science at Dartmouth College.\n\n\u201cObviously releasing misleading or doctored information is problematic, particularly when done by our officials,\u201d he said. But as the technology advances, he said, the question of what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not may be up for debate. \u201cAs the technology that allows us to manipulate images gets more sophisticated and easier to use, then the claim that a video is fake becomes more credible,\u201d he said.\n\nFarid points to another infamous piece of video to illustrate his point, the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape of Trump bragging about forcibly kissing and groping women. When that recording was revealed in 2016, he said, \u201cnobody said it was fake.\u201d Since then, Trump has cast doubt on its authenticity.\n\n\u201cIf that recording broke today, he would\u2019ve almost certainly say it is fake,\u201d he said. And given the spread of digital-altering technology, he \u201cwould have had plausible deniability.\u201d", "OTTAWA, Ontario \u2014 A Canadian lawmaker who was on a parliamentary committee with access to national security intelligence acknowledged Thursday he had inappropriate online relationships with more than one woman and was the target of two extortion attempts.\n\nTony Clement was removed from the opposition Conservative caucus this week.

(Lucas Jackson/Reuters)\n\nMedia critic\n\nThe people who shouted threatening chants at the residence of Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Wednesday night did more than just unsettle a family. They defaced property as well. A report from the D.C. police department indicates: \u201cIt was discovered that unknown persons spray painted an anarchy symbol on the driveway.\u201d\n\nIn a visit to the site, the Erik Wemple Blog and Post colleague Drew Goins documented this evidence:\n\n\n\nVandalism at the D.C. residence of Fox News host Tucker Carlson (Erik Wemple Blog)\n\nAs reported by The Post\u2019s Allyson Chiu, the protesters were seeking to express their displeasure with the rhetoric that Carlson offers on his eponymous prime-time program on Fox News. He has taken a hard line on immigration and demanded an explanation as to why diversity is a strength in the United States, in addition to hyping alleged crimes by undocumented immigrants. \u201cTucker Carlson, we will fight! We know where you sleep at night!\u201d they yelled in a chilling example of protest gone awry.\n\nD.C. police issued this statement: \u201cWe welcome those who come here to exercise their First Amendment rights in a safe and peaceful manner; however, we prohibit them from breaking the law. Last night, a group of protestors broke the law by defacing private property at a Northwest, DC residence. MPD takes these violations seriously, and we will work to hold those accountable for their unlawful actions. There is currently an open criminal investigation regarding this matter.\u201d\n\nWhen we arrived at Carlson\u2019s house Thursday afternoon, we found two D.C. police cruisers stationed in front of the property. In his interview with Chiu, Carlson said that his wife at first thought that the protesters were actually conducting a home invasion. \u201cShe had been in the kitchen alone getting ready to go to dinner and she heard pounding on the front door and screaming. \u2026 Someone started throwing himself against the front door and actually cracked the front door,\u201d Carlson said. None of the couple\u2019s four children were home at the time.\n\nBut there\u2019s no mention of a cracked door in the police report. The Erik Wemple Blog asked a department spokesperson whether the police had found a broken door or whether such a detail would be included in the report. \u201cOfficers take down as much information as possible,\u201d said the spokesperson, speaking generally about the process.\n\nWhen The Post visited Carlson\u2019s place, the front door appeared to be in working condition:\n\n\n\nThe front door at Tucker Carlson\u2019s D.C. residence.

She declined to allow us to photograph it from inside the house.\n\nWe asked Carlson to provide a picture of the crack and haven\u2019t received a response from the Fox News host. It\u2019s possible that he replaced the door, or that the crack is visible from the home\u2019s interior.", "\n\nAffordable homes, lower cost of living and job opportunities are among the lures in places like Austin and Atlanta. (Michelle Kondrich/For The Washington Post)\n\nAs they began planning their future together, Ashley Brown and her fiance, Aaron Shuman, concluded that they could no longer remain in Los Angeles because it was getting much too expensive.\n\n\u201cOur rent in L.A. was $1,500 for a tiny, 650-square-foot apartment with no amenities,\u201d says Brown, 29, a native New Yorker, actress and New York University graduate.

Also, the dollar stretches much further in their new city, giving them breathing room.\n\n\u201cWe pay $1,200 a month for more than double the space, with two bedrooms, two bathrooms and everything brand-new,\u201d she said.\n\nBrown and Shuman are part of a wave of people migrating from coastal cities to \u201csecondary\u201d cities \u2014 drawn by a lower cost of living, lighter tax burden, job growth and a better chance to buy a home they can afford.\n\nNashville, Sacramento, Atlanta, Phoenix, Austin and Dallas are among the top-10 cities with the largest influx of new residents, according to new data from the Redfin real estate brokerage.\n\nNot surprisingly, high-cost cities from which people are fleeing include San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles and Washington.\n\n\u201cPeople in the coastal markets are just fed up with double-digit price increases, and they\u2019re moving to a commuter town or to the middle of the country,\u201d said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist for Redfin. \u201cIn our most recent \u2018hottest markets\u2019 report, Indianapolis tied for third place with Boston among the cities where homes go under contract fastest. People are moving there from Chicago, Los Angeles and the Bay Area because it\u2019s affordable.\u201d\n\nThe migration also is driven by the Republicans\u2019 tax overhaul, which, among other provisions, capped the state and local tax deduction to $10,000.

In 78 percent of markets, home prices were less affordable than their historic averages.\n\n\u201cWe found that 30 percent of the population lives in a county where you need an annual income of at least $100,000 to buy a median-priced house,\u201d said Daren Blomquist, ATTOM senior vice president.\n\nImproved quality of life\n\nMany people relocating initially thought moving to a secondary city was trading down, but they quickly discovered that wasn\u2019t necessarily the case.\n\nWhat they did trade was stress in return for a higher quality of life.\n\nWhen Meg Epstein moved from Southern California to Nashville because of her husband\u2019s job, she said, she expected to find friendly Southern-style hospitality. She didn\u2019t expect to fall in love with the culturally rich city, which, she said, is much easier to enjoy than Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI spend so much less time in the car and in traffic. Valet parking is free, and I don\u2019t need reservations to go out to great restaurants,\u201d said Epstein, founder of California South Development, which builds condos in Nashville and other cities. \u201cNashville is known for its music scene, but a lot of people don\u2019t realize it has a great symphony and access to all kinds of arts and culture.\u201d\n\nSacramento, which tops the list for the most net inflow of residents, has the highest percentage of new residents coming from San Francisco.

And, on top of that, people can walk or ride their bikes or scooters and not have the expense of a car,\u201d he said.\n\nSome cities, such as Phoenix and Orlando, are seeing growth as much from baby boomers seeking a lower cost of living for their retirement as they are from millennials, Kunes said.\n\nGood-paying jobs\n\nBrown and Shuman moved to Atlanta anticipating that they might make less money but that it would still be more affordable. Instead, Brown said, they\u2019re both making more money than they did in Los Angeles, which compounds the benefit of the lower cost of living.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of big companies in Atlanta, like Delta Air Lines and Mailchimp, that pay very well,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIf you have a college degree, it\u2019s pretty easy to get a job here.\u201d\n\nJobs are an important piece of the choice to move.\n\n\u201cOne thing that makes it easier for people to relocate is that there are more remote workers all the time,\u201d Fairweather said. \u201cIf you can live anywhere, it makes more sense to live somewhere that\u2019s less expensive. At the same time, more companies are willing to open offices in other cities to accommodate remote workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the combination of affordable housing and jobs that are causing people to move,\u201d Blomquist said. \u201cIn places like Tampa, Dallas and Las Vegas, there\u2019s a booming economy, with lots of jobs, along with relatively affordable homes. You can cut your housing costs in half if you move to Dallas from Los Angeles and there are jobs there, too.\u201d\n\nNon-farm employment rose the fastest in Florida, at 4.8 percent in September, compared with September 2017, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Employment was up 3.3 percent in Texas, 3.2 percent in Nevada, 2.9 percent in Arizona, 2.5 percent in Georgia and 2.1 percent in Tennessee.\n\n[Hottest areas for millennial renters]\n\nWell-paid science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) jobs are flowing to some secondary locales, such as Denver, Austin, Raleigh-Durham, Nashville and Charlotte, Walter said, especially with start-up companies that want to locate in affordable cities.\n\n\u201cOne of the driving factors in places where STEM jobs are growing is a good relationship between universities and businesses, such as Vanderbilt in Nashville and the University of Texas in Austin,\u201d Walter said. \u201cBusinesses also want to locate in places with higher-than-average population growth, higher-than-average job growth and a lot of younger people starting careers.\u201d\n\nMany of the cities are in the Southeast and Texas, places with a reputation for a simple regulatory system that makes it easier to start a business, Walter said.\n\nSome of the high-growth cities also benefit from a convenient location.\n\n\u201cI can get a direct flight to London, be in New York or Miami in less than two hours, and take a weekend trip to Charleston from Nashville,\u201d Epstein said.\n\nTax advantages also help drive growth in some of these markets. There\u2019s no state income tax in Florida, Nevada, Tennessee or Texas.\n\nMaking adjustments\n\nThe biggest challenge facing secondary cities is how they will handle growth. Home prices have risen rapidly in many of them, so although they are \u201caffordable\u201d cities compared with some coastal markets, they\u2019re far less affordable than in the past, Blomquist said.\n\n[Where you\u2019ll need to earn a six-figure annual salary to buy a median-priced home]\n\n\u201cWe look at affordability in relation to local wages, and we\u2019ve seen that in places such as Clark County in Las Vegas, you now need 44 percent of the average annual wage there to buy a median-priced house, which is much more than in the past,\u201d Blomquist said.\n\nNationwide, average wage-earners would need to spend 37 percent of their income to buy a median-priced home, above the historic national average of 34 percent. But in high-priced markets, such as Kings County (Brooklyn), N.Y., 135 percent of average income is required to buy a median-priced house.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great if you have a place to sell in a high-priced market and move to a lower-priced market, but for long-term residents, rising prices in these secondary cities [are] making them less affordable,\u201d Blomquist said. \u201cIn some markets, like Denver and Dallas, that were \u2018steady Eddie\u2019 markets with relatively stable home prices, we\u2019ve seen home prices rise faster than wages. That means there\u2019s a potential for a bigger downturn unless home price appreciation slows, as it already has in many markets.\u201d\n\nAnother major challenge for many of these cities is the lack of public transit, particularly a rail network.\n\nProposals are in place in Atlanta to build 21 miles of light rail and 18 miles of bus rapid transit lanes, but that can take years to accomplish. In Nashville and Austin, voters in recent years rejected public transit plans because of the increased tax burden required to pay for such systems.\n\nIn Dallas, funding is still an obstacle to plans to expand a downtown subway system and a commuter rail line. City officials there also are looking into streetcars as a traffic solution.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see how these cities handle transit options over the next decade,\u201d Walter said. \u201cSome cities have been proactive and have put in dedicated bus lanes or rail already, and they\u2019ll handle growth better. Cities that don\u2019t address transportation issues will likely see growth slow in future years.\u201d"]
