["Manchester City\u2019s Ilkay Gundogan celebrates after scoring his side\u2019s third goal during the English Premier League soccer match between Manchester City and Manchester United at the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018. (Dave Thompson/Associated Press)\n\nMANCHESTER, England \u2014 Previously concluded Financial Fair Play cases could be reopened, UEFA warned on Monday as evidence grows of Manchester City\u2019s attempts to disguise its source of income and spending.\n\nThe UEFA statement on the prospect of the financial compliance system being \u201cabused\u201d by teams comes after internal correspondence exposing City\u2019s alleged deception was published by European media outlets.\n\nThe reigning English Premier League champion and current leader has not provided a defense or disputed the authenticity of the information from leaked emails which reveal elaborate attempts over several years to try to avoid breaching the rules designed to curb overspending on player costs.\n\nCity, which has been owned by Abu Dhabi\u2019s Sheikh Mansour for a decade, has already been punished for violating FFP after reaching a settlement agreement with UEFA in 2014 that saw it fined rather than banned from the Champions League.\n\nHaving spent more than a week declining to comment on the information in the \u201cFootball Leaks\u201d documents, UEFA has issued a response to questions about City that raises the prospect of new sanctions.\n\n\u201cShould new information suggest that previously concluded cases have been abused, those cases may be capable of being re-opened as determined on a case by case basis,\u201d UEFA said. \u201cThis approach is applied universally to all clubs that apply for a UEFA license and participate in European club competitions.\u201d\n\nThe agreement with UEFA eventually saw City forfeit only 20 million euros ($23 million) in Champions League prize money. UEFA has not said how aware it was in 2014 of City\u2019s plans to hide spending of more recent schemes, which have been reported in a five-part series by German magazine Der Spiegel.\n\n\u201cFFP is a framework which clubs that wish to play in UEFA competitions agree to abide by,\u201d the organizer of the Champions League and Europa League said in a statement. \u201cIt relies on the cooperation of clubs to declare a complete and genuine financial position. While UEFA can test the information it receives, it relies on that information being fair and accurate reflections of a club\u2019s finances.\u201d\n\nThe title sponsor of City\u2019s stadium, training campus, and jersey backer is Etihad Airways, the state-owned airline from Abu Dhabi. Sheikh Mansour is a member of Abu Dhabi\u2019s royal family and deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe leaks emails claimed to show in 2015 how the Etihad deal generated 67.5 million pounds annually for City. But City\u2019s holding company \u2014 state-backed Abu Dhabi United Group \u2014 channeled 59.9 million pounds back to Etihad, according to Jorge Chumillas, the club chief financial officer in an internal email.\n\nThe evidence could be significant for UEFA which checks clubs\u2019 finances annually to ensure they are meeting break-even requirements on a rolling three-year basis.\n\n\u201cThis includes a thorough assessment of clubs\u2019 financial positions on the basis of both the information disclosed by the clubs (based on their independently audited financial statements) as well as a number of compliance checks and analysis undertaken by UEFA (including independent external audits),\u201d UEFA said. \u201cIf new information comes to light that may be material to this assessment, UEFA will use that to challenge the figures and will seek explanation, clarification or rebuttal from the club concerned.\u201d\n\nAbu Dhabi United Group was also alleged to be sending cash to a shell vehicle which was created to supposedly buy the right to use players\u2019 images in marketing campaigns. This helped raise revenue by 30 million euros in one case cited by Der Spiegel, which reported City\u2019s emails from 2013.\n\nCity has not commented on its use of the Fordham Sports Management image rights company or attempts to shift costs away from the club.\n\nRoberto Mancini, who managed City from 2009-13 and won the Premier League in 2012, was also shown to have received more pay from a team Sheikh Mansour owns in Abu Dhabi than from the Manchester club. Der Spiegel shows Mancini signed two contracts at the same time, to receive a base salary of 1.45 million pounds from City and 1.45 million pounds and 1.75 million pounds for advising Al Jazira Sports.\n\nSince July 2011, UEFA has monitored the annual accounts of all clubs entering its two club competitions. The first period UEFA assessed clubs for compliance with FFP was 2011-13 when owners were allowed to cover losses up to 45 million euros.\n\nUEFA requires clubs to approach break-even on football-related business \u2014 television rights fees, buying and selling players, salaries, sponsor deals, tickets sales, prize money. The complex accounting rules encourage clubs to spend on long-term projects \u2014 stadiums, youth training \u2014 which do not count as losses for FFP purposes.\n\n\u201cFinancial Fair Play has led to a step change in the health of the finances in European club football,\u201d UEFA said on Monday. \u201cSeven years ago, European clubs had a cumulative debt of 1.7 billion euros. Last year it was a profit of 600 million euros. Without question, it has been a success for the game across Europe.\u201d\n\nQatar-owned Paris Saint-Germain was sanctioned for overspending in 2014 at the same time as City. The Spanish soccer league last year asked UEFA to investigate City and PSG, claiming they benefit from state aid which \u201cdistorts European competitions\u201d and \u201cis irreparably harming the football industry.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Around 3.5 million Syrian refugees are estimated to be on Turkish territory.\n\nThe EU has hailed the agreement with Turkey as a great success as it has helped slash migrant arrival numbers. However, many migrants are still languishing in terrible conditions on the Greek islands.\n\nThe bloc wants to replicate versions of the agreement with countries in northern Africa as it seeks to stop migrants setting out on dangerous voyages in rickety boats across the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nAsked whether the EU refugee money in Turkey has been well spent, Jakobson said \u201cI think so, yes.

He was able to do it largely because of the strong seasons from tight end Rob Gronkowski, running back Dion Lewis and receiver Brandin Cooks.\n\nAnd despite a slow start, the defense was strong down the stretch, ending the regular season allowing just 18.5 points per game.\n\nFast-forward to 2018 and so much has changed following roster changes in the offseason.\n\nLewis signed with the Titans in free agency, creating a hole at running back that the Patriots have had trouble plugging. Cooks was traded and Brady has yet to develop consistent chemistry with a revamped group of receivers that has also had injuries.\n\nAs a result, Brady spent a good portion his 300th career NFL game Sunday under increasing pressure. He was sacked three times and hurried a total of six times by the Titans. He\u2019s only been sacked 16 times this season, but he\u2019s working harder in the pocket.\n\nBrady already has seven interceptions in 2018, one fewer than he had in all of 2017. They haven\u2019t all been the result of pressure from the defense. But he\u2019s had more overthrows working behind an increasingly injury-battered line that may be missing the leadership of free agency departure Nate Solder at left tackle.\n\nTrent Brown, who the Patriots acquired to fill Solder\u2019s spot, has started all 10 games and been solid. But he\u2019s now part of a growing list of offensive linemen nursing injuries.\n\nBrown missed the final drive of the first half against the Titans because of illness. LaAdrian Waddle replaced him for that series, with Brown returning early in the third quarter. But Brown left again with an injured back.\n\nEven more concerning for the Patriots (7-3) was the sight of Edelman leaving with an ankle injury. Gronkowski, who sat out Sunday, has now missed two of the last three games with ankle and back injuries. His backup, Dwayne Allen, could also miss some time after injuring his knee against Tennessee.\n\nBrady tried to lean on Josh Gordon, who has shined in recent weeks since his trade from Cleveland. But Gordon had just four catches on 12 targets against the Titans.\n\nIt added up to Brady being held without a touchdown pass for the second time in three weeks. His passer rating is down from 102.8 last season to 94.8 this season.\n\nDefensively there are concerns, too. After finding a groove in the second half of 2017, the Patriots haven\u2019t quite turned the same corner with linebacker coach Brian Flores calling plays following the departure of former defensive coordinator Matt Patricia. They are allowing 24 points and giving up 381 yards per game and continue to struggle with mobile quarterbacks.\n\nBrady said this upcoming bye week must feature a lot of self-assessment.\n\n\u201cI think the coaches will do a lot of self-scouting. I think we as players have to do the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully we learn from it. All of these games are a little bit different. ... The ones that we\u2019re going to play will be a little bit different. Winning football takes a lot of things. It takes a lot of good performances from a lot of people. Losing football is the exact opposite.\n\n\u201cWinning in the NFL is hard. You can\u2019t just show up expecting to win.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Kyle Hightower on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/khightower\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Mark LoMoglio/Associated Press)\n\nTAMPA, Fla. \u2014 The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are sticking with Ryan Fitzpatrick as their No. 1 quarterback.\n\nCoach Dirk Koetter said Monday that the 14th-year pro, who failed to produce a touchdown in the previous day\u2019s 16-3 loss to Washington, will start next Sunday on the road against the New York Giants.\n\nThe Bucs (3-6) have dropped six of seven games following a 2-0 start, with Fitzpatrick starting four of the losses after leading the team to surprising victories over New Orleans and Philadelphia while Jameis Winston was serving a suspension for violating the NFL\u2019s personal conduct policy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to go with Fitz this week,\u201d Koetter said, adding he still feels Fitzpatrick \u201cgives us the best opportunity\u201d to win and pull out of a tailspin that\u2019s jeopardized the prospects of ending a long playoff drought.\n\nAlso, struggling kicker Chandler Catanzaro was waived.\n\nCatanzaro was one for three on field goals against the Redskins, missing from 30 and 47 yards. In addition to being 11 of 15 through nine games, the fifth-year pro who signed as a free agent after spending last season with the New York Jets has missed four extra points.\n\nWinston, banned the first three games of the season for touching a female Uber driver inappropriately in 2016, regained his starting job for three games before being benched three weeks ago.\n\nKoetter left open the possibility of switching back to Winston after the Bucs gained 501 yards, but only scored three points against the Redskins. Fitzpatrick threw for 406 yards, but was intercepted twice and lost a fumble.\n\nWashington finished with four takeaways, while Tampa Bay failed to force a turnover for the sixth consecutive game.\n\n\u201cTurnovers are killing us right now. We\u2019re minus-19 (in turnover differential), last in the league,\u201d Koetter said. \u201cThirteen turnovers and no takeaways in the last four games. That\u2019s by far the No. 1 thing that\u2019s hurting our team.\u201d\n\nWinston hasn\u2019t played since throwing four interceptions during the first three quarters of a road loss at Cincinnati on Oct. 28. The fourth-year player has thrown 10 picks and lost one fumble in four games since returning from his suspension.\n\nKoetter remains optimistic that the Bucs, who haven\u2019t made the playoffs since 2007, can turn themselves around.\n\nWinston, the first overall pick from the 2015 draft, is due to earn $20.9 million next year in the final season of the contract he signed as a rookie.\n\nKoetter said he understands the thinking that the Bucs need to find out exactly what they have in the fourth-year pro.\n\nNevertheless, he\u2019s sticking with Fitzpatrick for now.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re barely past the halfway point in the season. There\u2019s a lot of football to be played. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the realm of possibility that we can turn this thing and get on a little bit of a win streak,\u201d Koetter said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to play better football more consistently across the board,\u201d the coach added. \u201cOur defense took a nice step in that direction (Sunday). I still think when we put it together on both sides of the ball we\u2019ll be all right.\u201d\n\nFitzpatrick, 2-4 as the starter this season, has 2,199 yards, 17 touchdowns and nine interceptions. He\u2019s turned the ball over five times the past two weeks during losses to Carolina and Washington.\n\nAfter Sunday\u2019s game, the 35-year-old shrugged off a question about whether he felt he had done enough to retain the starting job.\n\n\u201cI love playing football. That\u2019s not something I concern myself with or care about,\u201d said Fitzpatrick, who\u2019s played for seven teams over 14 seasons. \u201cIf I get a chance to go out there, I try to do my best and play as hard as I can and enjoy myself.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

She-Hulk is an enduring fantasy for reasons that have nothing to do with some male readers\u2019 (and creators\u2019) dreams of being dominated by powerful women. She-Hulk speaks to a world where women are compelling and alluring when we\u2019re at our most powerful, where our anger must be reckoned with and can\u2019t be an excuse to marginalize us.\n\nIn the midst of a years-long conversation about sexual violence, female vulnerability and sexual freedom, Dan Slott\u2019s \u201cSingle Green Female\u201d She-Hulk stories are a blast of liberating fun. She-Hulk\u2019s romantic adventures let us imagine what it might be like to be a woman who could never be hurt or overpowered by a partner. Because her superpowers manifest in the form of physical transformation, she\u2019s harder to distort or reduce to a pinup, as some artists have done to superheroines whose powers are more intangible. She-Hulk is strong, and that strength is a source of pleasure to her as much as it is a reason for us to admire her.\n\nAnd at a time when the women confronting senators over Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court were alternately painted as aggressive or hysterical, I felt braced by scenes of She-Hulk\u2019s righteous anger. The panels where she confronts and outwits Iron Man, who assumes that, like her cousin, she becomes a mindless monster when she\u2019s transformed, make me hope for a day when the public can recognize the reason behind women\u2019s rage. She-Hulk doesn\u2019t lose herself when she transforms; she becomes a more concentrated version of herself.\n\nI suspect the reasons She-Hulk has been so resonant for me are also the major obstacles to a She-Hulk movie adaptation or a streaming show about her. She\u2019s not a tortured anti-heroine, nor is she a sex object who happens to punch really hard. Instead, she\u2019s a modern woman whose greatest power seems to be her ability to blast through the complications and contradictions that vex the rest of us.\n\nRead more:\n\nAlyssa Rosenberg: For a moment, the Red Sox World Series victory made the world make sense again\n\nAlyssa Rosenberg: The \u2018good guy with a gun\u2019 is Hollywood\u2019s most dangerous lie", "A Brexit deal may be days, weeks or an eternity away, and it is tearing everyone apart \u2014 the people, the parties, even Boris Johnson\u2019s family.\n\nThe leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, told the Germans in an interview published Friday that \u201cwe can\u2019t stop\u201d Brexit.

No second thoughts. No compromise. When he quit Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s cabinet in July, he wailed that May was surrendering to Brussels in Brexit negotiations and that Britain was \u201cheaded for the status of a colony.\u201d\n\nYounger brother Jo Johnson was also part of May\u2019s cabinet, as transport minister, and he echoed some of Boris\u2019s sentiment when he resigned in a huff on Friday. May\u2019s plan for Brexit was simply too much of a shambolic compromise, he said.

Germany is last in the group, having collected one point from three games, and is on the brink of relegation but coach Joachim Loew\u2019s decision to stay on in the role is under as much scrutiny as the team\u2019s mettle. (Christophe Ena, FILE/Associated Press)\n\nIt has plunged Germany into renewed crisis, provoked scenes of jubilation in Kosovo and Gibraltar, and set up what could be an exciting week of international soccer in a summer usually bereft of competition for European countries.\n\nThe UEFA Nations League might not have been welcomed by some clubs across the continent \u2014 Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp called it \u201cthe most senseless competition in the world of football\u201d \u2014 but it has generated plenty of intriguing story lines to pique interest in its inaugural year.\n\nThe competition has reached its final set of qualifying matches, and results over the next week will determine which teams will feature in a Final Four mini-tournament in June \u2014 when the first Nations League champion will be crowned. Currently, France, Belgium, Portugal and Spain are favorites to be the finalists.\n\nThe upcoming matches will also establish which of the lower-ranked teams qualify for the Nations League playoffs, from which one place at the 2020 European Championship will be awarded.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what\u2019s at stake:\n\nGROUP A1\n\nFrance, the world champion, has won two of its first three group games and will advance to the Final Four with a win over the Netherlands in Rotterdam on Friday. A victory for the Dutch means they can then qualify by beating \u2014 or potentially even drawing with \u2014 Germany in the group closer in Gelsenkirchen on Monday.\n\nFrance has seen four players, including Paul Pogba, withdraw from the squad through injury on Monday.\n\nGermany is last in the group, having collected one point from three games, and is on the brink of relegation to League B featuring Europe\u2019s second-tier nations. Coming after a World Cup where the team failed to get out of the group stage, coach Germany coach Joachim Loew\u2019s decision to stay on in the role is under as much scrutiny as the team\u2019s mettle.\n\nGROUP A2\n\nIceland has already been relegated after losing its first three games, leaving Belgium and Switzerland \u2014 tied on points \u2014 to battle for first place. The Belgians have played a game less, so a home win over Iceland on Thursday will leave them three points clear heading into the group decider in Switzerland on Monday.\n\nBelgium is the world\u2019s top-ranked team and will look for revenge for its semifinal loss to France at the World Cup if it does reach the Final Four.\n\nGROUP A3\n\nThere is an added emphasis on which of Portugal or Italy advances, considering the team that qualifies from this group will host the Final Four in June. Portugal is the favorite after winning its first two games, without needing Cristiano Ronaldo, and needs only a point away to Italy on Saturday to guarantee first place.\n\nIf Italy wins, Portugal can still finish top with a home win on Tuesday over Poland, which has already been relegated after picking up just one point from its first three games.\n\nGROUP A4\n\nSpain looked on course to qualify comfortably from a group also containing England and World Cup runner-up Croatia after beating both teams in its first two games. Losing to England 3-2 in Sevilla last month, in arguably the standout match of the entire group stage so far, has kept things alive.\n\nIf Spain loses to Croatia in Zagreb on Thursday, England can finish first with a win over the Croats at Wembley Stadium on Sunday.\n\nSpain coach Luis Enrique has called up Barcelona left back Jordi Alba for the first time since taking charge of the team after the World Cup.\n\nLEAGUE B\n\nUkraine became the first country to secure promotion to Group A for the second Nations League, in 2020. Bosnia and Russia are well clear in their groups and need one point from their final matches, against Austria and Sweden respectively, to also ensure promotion.\n\nIn the other group in League B, Wales and Denmark are fighting for first place. They meet in Cardiff on Friday, when a Welsh win would guarantee them top spot.\n\nThe Nations League also offers a second chance to qualify for the European Championship in 2020. The 16 group winners in Leagues A, B, C and D \u2014 or the next best-placed teams who have not already qualified via the European qualifiers starting in March \u2014 will progress to the playoffs to compete for the last four qualifying places.\n\nIt means the so-called minnows of Europe have something tangible to play for.\n\nLEAGUE C\n\nNo teams have won their group so far, though Finland is close after winning its first four games in Group C2 and needs one point from its last two.\n\nIn Group C1, Israel and Scotland are batting for first place; in Group C3, Norway and Bulgaria are tied on points with two games left; and in Group C4, there is a three-way fight between Serbia, Montenegro and Romania.\n\nLEAGUE D\n\nIn the league containing Europe\u2019s weakest countries, Gibraltar and Kosovo \u2014 two of the newest members of UEFA \u2014 have claimed their first ever competitive international wins.\n\nKosovo is top of Group D3, two points clear of Azerbaijan with two games left.

(Hassene Dridi/Associated Press)\n\nTUNIS, Tunisia \u2014 Tunisian Prime Minister Youssef Chahed faced lawmakers in a marathon debate Monday ahead of a vote of confidence needed to approve the government he reshuffled a week ago in a bid to end a months-long paralyzing political crisis.\n\nThe debate was still going 12 hours later, a sign of the enmity coursing through Tunisia\u2019s political scene.\n\nHowever, the prime minister was unlikely to lose the vote due in large part to support of the largest parliamentary bloc, the moderate Islamist Ennahdha party, which has 68 seats in the 217-seat parliament. Chahed needed 109 votes to keep his government from collapsing.\n\nChahed pleaded for \u201cpolitical stability the nation needs to overcome difficulties,\u201d notably economic and social, ahead of 2019 legislative and presidential elections.\n\nJoblessness is above 15 percent, inflation is nearly 8 percent and trade and other deficits are chronic in the North African nation. The budding democracy, also coping with extremist attacks, is having trouble overcoming political problems despite major strides since autocratic leader Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was toppled in 2011.\n\nChahed, 41, incurred new anger among detractors a week ago, including from the Tunisian president and the prime minister\u2019s prime political enemy, the president\u2019s son, with his appointment of 19 new Cabinet ministers. The changes were aimed at \u201cending the political crisis,\u201d he said, but the reshuffle exacerbated enmity from his opponents.\n\nThe office of President Beji Caid Essebsi, who chose Chahed for the job of prime minister in 2016, said the president was informed of the changes \u201cvery late\u201d and by mail.\n\nThe president\u2019s son, Hafedh, who has risen to the top of the Nida Tounes party created by his father, has for months been in open conflict with Chahed, a one-time party figure.\n\nThe powerful UGTT union has also demanded \u201cprofound changes in the government\u201d \u2014 including its leader.\n\nThe friction has kept the government from tending to the nation\u2019s business, and the daily concerns of Tunisians.\n\nWhile naming a new justice minister, Karim Jamoussi, Chahed made no changes to key ministries like interior or defense. He also brought some surprise faces into the government, notably a Tunisian Jew, Rene Trabelsi, as tourism minister, a first in more than 50 years \u2014 and one topic that raised questions during Monday\u2019s debate.

The most visible example of how that is not entirely coming to pass came two months ago at the United Nations, when foreign leaders audibly laughed at Trump\u2019s bogus claim to unprecedented achievements.\n\nBut it\u2019s hardly the only example. Increasingly, when Trump graces the world stage, he is being trolled, not-so-subtly rebuked, or used as a foil in ways that suggest foreign countries see Trump less as someone worthy of fear and respect, and more as a tool they can use for their own purposes.\n\nThis sort of thing is often coming from allies and official sources.\n\nIn recent days, both French President Emmanuel Macron and the French army have cast Trump in a not entirely flattering light. Macron seemed to pretty directly rebuke Trump during a speech Sunday, even as the U.S. president was still in Paris for World War I remembrances. In a speech, Macron described nationalism \u2014 a term Trump embraced for the first time a few weeks ago \u2014 as a \u201cbetrayal of patriotism.\u201d Macron also decried the \u201cselfishness of nations only looking after their own interests.\u201d The remarks could have been directed at any of the nationalist leaders of the world, but it wasn\u2019t difficult to draw a line between them and Trump\u2019s very recent nationalist declaration.\n\nMacron also seemed to rebuke Trump without naming him at the same U.N. General Assembly mentioned above. While the laughter got the most attention, Macron delivered a speech that appeared to rebuke Trump\u2019s emphasis on \u201csovereignty.\u201d \u201cI shall never stop upholding the principle of sovereignty,\u201d Macron said, \u201ceven in the face of certain nationalism which we\u2019re seeing today, brandishing sovereignty as a way of attacking others.\u201d\n\nLikewise, the French army trolled Trump on Monday for skipping a ceremony at France\u2019s Aisne-Marne American Cemetery. It was a decision for which inclement weather had been cited, despite other world leaders showing up in the rain. The French army tweeted a photo of rain-soaked soldiers navigating an obstacle course and added text that translates to: \u201cThere is rain, but it does not matter.

The Nigerian army tweeted the video of Trump and said, \u201cPlease Watch and Make Your Deductions\u201d \u2014 apparently using Trump\u2019s words to justify its use of deadly force in such a situation a few days earlier. (The tweet was soon deleted.)\n\nThe apparent trolling of Trump has extended to other allies. In June at the Group of Seven, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau presented Trump with a framed picture of a hotel Trump\u2019s grandfather ran in Canada, which was reportedly a brothel. (Trump denies it was a brothel.)\n\nGreat moment between @JustinTrudeau and @POTUS when he gave him picture of the President\u2019s grandfather\u2019s hotel in Canada. #G72018 pic.twitter.com/mtl5c7QPB3 \u2014 Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) June 9, 2018\n\nEarly in Trump\u2019s presidency, Sweden\u2019s deputy prime minister also appeared to have some fun at Trump\u2019s expense by reenacting a photo of Trump signing a bill surrounded by white men. She was surrounded by only women, who stood in similar positions as the men in Trump\u2019s photo. \u201cWe are a feminist government, which shows in this photo,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Isabella L\u00f6vin said at the time. \u201cUltimately it is up to the observer to interpret the photo.\u201d\n\nJust signed referral of Swedish #climate law, binding all future governments to net zero emissions by 2045.

The totality of them suggests Trump is viewed as something of a foil \u2014 and occasionally as a punchline \u2014 by foreign leaders whose constituencies largely aren\u2019t fans of Trump\u2019s.\n\nTrump has enjoyed being something of a bull in a china shop on the world stage. Whatever leaders think of him, they\u2019ll be reluctant to run afoul of the leader of the world\u2019s most powerful country. Often their approach, like that of politicians in Washington, is to tolerate Trump\u2019s odd style, attacks and controversies. But, given that Trump is historically unpopular on the world stage, that also means neglecting a potentially powerful tool for use in domestic politics. They seem to be finding creative ways to make their points.\n\nBut these aren\u2019t ways you\u2019d generally expect an American president to be treated. And it\u2019s certainly not an overwhelming amount of respect.", "\n\nNorman criticized Redskins fans for their lack of support after Sunday's win over Tampa Bay. (Kim Klement/USA Today Sports)\n\nColumnist\n\nSports columnist Thomas Boswell was asked in his weekly online chat about Redskins cornerback Josh Norman\u2019s criticism of Washington fans for failing to support the team at FedEx Field. Please tell Norman, the reader wrote, \u201cto \u2018encourage\u2019 rather than \u2018slam\u2019 his hometown fans. How loud do you think the boo birds will be at the next FedEx Field game?\u201d\n\nBoswell: Norman obviously has little or no sense of Skins history over the last 25 years, especially the 20 years of the Snyder era. Many fans have felt that they were driven away from rooting for the home team because of bad performance by the players or bad behavior (of many types) by team executives or owner Daniel Snyder. At the least, there are many fans who are, with good reason, \u201cquick to turn\u201d when things go badly because they have been burned so often before.\n\nThe type of player that epitomizes this era is the overhyped, overpaid SnyderSkins Fake Superstar, whether that is Albert Haynesworth or the long line of past their prime \u201cstars\u201d like Donovan McNabb, late-career Deion Sanders . . . I was going to make a list, but it is just too long and depressing.\n\nHere\u2019s the irony: Norman does not realize that he is one of these overhyped, overpaid Snyder-toy guys! Just a few weeks ago, national TV analysts were pointing out his deficiencies in pass coverage and how other opposing teams picked on him. Norman has been adequate this season \u2014 not, as some say, the Skins' \u201cthird-best cornerback.\u201d But he needs to understand that with two interceptions this year and none last year, he is an example of exactly why Skins fans boo the players that they associate with Snyder-era mistakes. For every fan it\u2019s a different list of players who seem tarnished or symptomatic of this period. Alex Smith is a perfect example. Those who miss Kirk Cousins will bemoan Smith\u2019s limitations and wish for Wonderful Kirk to return. Those who were glad to see Kirk and his drama leave town may be miffed that Smith hasn\u2019t done more to prove them right that No Cousins could be overcome.\n\nIt\u2019s a tough situation for the Skins, and has been for several years at FedEx because the only people that fans can boo are the players. But they (in most cases) really want to boo Snyder and team president Bruce Allen. The players think, \u201cOur fans are against us.\u201d It\u2019s far closer to the truth just to say that many fans are FedUp at FedEx and take it out on any target of opportunity when things go badly.\n\nAnd, of course, general declining interest also opens up tickets for fans of the visiting team to show up and cheer.\n\nNone of this is going to change fast. But, as this questioner points out, 6-3 is 6-3, so give some credit. Yes, even in a year when one game ends with the opponent, trailing by three points, hitting the goal post with a last-second field goal attempt while, the next week, the Skins hit a goal post and the kick is good.\n\n[Svrluga: Redskins players have every reason to be frustrated. Redskins fans have even more.]\n\nNorman\u2019s criticism of Redskins fans prompted another question. Does a player, this reader asked, \u201cever benefit when he (or she) criticizes the team\u2019s fans for being insufficiently supportive at home, particularly when that player is one of the team\u2019s highest paid and has performed unevenly over the past few years? Is it frustrating that FedEx lacks the home field advantage that RFK once held? Sure. But I\u2019ve always been of the view that fans pay for their tickets and are entitled to \u201cboo\u201d as long as they check the expletives and control their alcohol intake.\u201d\n\nBoswell: All fans, as you say, have the right to express themselves as long as they aren\u2019t drunken louts. More to the point with the Skins, entering this year, they had the 25th-best \u2014 or, put another way, the eighth-worst \u2014 record in the NFL over the previous 25 years. That is an eternity of bad football, even though the Skins \u2014 thanks to their fans \u2014 have had enormous resources to spend on players (and coaches) in this period. To rub salt in that wound, the Skins have not had even one really good year or even one really outstanding season in all that time!\n\nFrom \u201972 through \u201991, the Skins had 10 teams with a winning percentage of .688 (11-5) or better. Ten.\n\nSince then, in 26 seasons, how many Skins teams have had a winning percentage of .688 (11-5 or better)? Zero! None!\n\nFrom 10 in a span of 20 years to zero in 26 years.\n\nJosh needs to study those numbers and \u201cinternalize\u201d the reality of the team he plays for. That way, if things go poorly and the Skins end up 8-8 (or whatever) and miss the playoffs and Norman has a couple of bad games, perhaps he won\u2019t become the face of the unraveling.\n\nBTW, Norman gave one of the most intelligent, engaging, not boastful, one-on-one postgame interviews I\u2019ve heard this season after Sunday\u2019s game. When he has a mob of 15 or more reporters in his face beside his locker after games it seems to bring out his inner egotist and exaggerator. When he has a little more room to breathe, he\u2019s a lot more likable. Everybody knows that defensive backs, like Major League Baseball closers, have to have tons of self-confidence, often a form of extreme athletic arrogance, to survive in their job. But I suspect the \u201creal\u201d Norman \u2014 not the amped-up desperate-man-on-an-island that he must become during games \u2014 is somebody most fans would like. Of course, he didn\u2019t help himself with his current comments.\n\nRead more on the Redskins:\n\nD.J.

(Carlo Allegri/Reuters)\n\nRight now in Florida, three statewide races \u2014 for senator, governor and agriculture commissioner \u2014 are in the throes of a dramatic recount to determine the winners. It can be a confusing process to follow, because there are several competing narratives and a lot of legal jargon.\n\nSo, let\u2019s break down exactly what is happening down in the Sunshine State. No disrespect to the ag commissioner \u2014 it\u2019s a really important job! \u2014 but we\u2019re going to focus on the Senate and gubernatorial races.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nOn Election Night, it appeared that Republican Rick Scott, Florida\u2019s governor, was headed to the Senate, and Republican Ron DeSantis was headed to the governor\u2019s mansion in Tallahassee. The Democratic candidate for governor, Andrew Gillum, even gave an early-morning concession speech.\n\nBut as ballots continued to be counted over the following days, the Republicans' leads shrunk to margins that made the races too close to call. Scott was leading incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson by only 12,500 votes, and DeSantis was ahead of Gillum by almost 34,000.\n\nAny margins under 0.5 percent trigger an automatic recount in the state.\n\nOn Sunday, Gillum rescinded his concession, which is not binding regardless.\n\nSo what\u2019s happening right now?\n\nAs ordered Saturday, the state is in the midst of a machine recount. After that, if any of the races are within a .25 margin then there could be a manual recount. If current vote totals held, that would be true of the Senate race. There were significant undervotes in the Senate race (ballots on which machines did not detect a vote for a Senate candidate at all) in Broward County, which many people say was the result of the race\u2019s placement on the ballot. But Nelson\u2019s campaign is hoping it was a machine error and those extra votes will be captured if the ballots are manually counted.\n\nHere\u2019s a copy of the Broward ballot:\n\nHere's a sample ballot for Tuesday's election for Broward residents in the 22nd Congressional District.\n\nPeople may not have seen the U.S. Senate race because of its position (bottom left) vis a vis the governor's race.\n\nBut the Senate race was there. pic.twitter.com/yo14dIywAD \u2014 Anthony Man (@browardpolitics) November 7, 2018\n\nWhen will this all be finished?\n\nFlorida counties have until Thursday at 8 p.m. to finish their recounts. But some counties have complained that they can\u2019t finish in time, so expect Democrats to ask for an extension. Also, ballots from overseas and the military can be counted as late as Friday as long as they are postmarked to Election Day, though there\u2019s unlikely to be enough to make or break the result. The final vote will be certified Nov. 20.\n\nBut what about all that voter fraud?\n\nRepublicans, namely Scott and President Trump, have claimed that, in Broward County specifically, there\u2019s fraudulent activity afoot to benefit the Democrats, including forged ballots. But there is no evidence to support this, and the Florida secretary of state said there\u2019s no evidence of any illegal behavior.\n\nMoreover, state Judge Jack Tuter scolded the Scott team Monday morning for propagating the notion of voter fraud.\n\nTuter also appeared to admonish the Scott team for suggesting voter fraud without offering evidence of it.\n\n\u201cWe should be careful what we say,\u201d Tuter said. \u201cThese words mean things these days, as everybody in the room knows.\u201d\n\nWhat does Trump have to say about all of this?\n\nAs mentioned above, the president has been spreading the unfounded claim that there is voter fraud in Florida. He tweeted Monday morning that the recount should end and Scott and DeSantis should be deemed the winners based on Election Night results, which, as The Washington Post\u2019s Philip Bump points out, would be \u201cdisenfranchising tens of thousands of voters deliberately.\u201d\n\nThe Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2018\n\nAren\u2019t there also a bunch of competing lawsuits?\n\nYes, campaign legal teams were in court Monday morning, in fact. The judge ruled against a request by Scott\u2019s legal team that Broward County ballots and machines not used in the recount be impounded.\n\nAs Post colleagues reported, there was also another suit filed asking that all mail-in ballots postmarked by last Tuesday be counted. Under current rules, ballots must be received by 7 p.m. on Election Day. That suit is a joint effort of VoteVets, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nAlso Monday, the League of Women Voters and the nonprofit watchdog group Common Cause Florida filed a lawsuit asking that Scott be barred from using \u201cthe power of his office in any manner related to Florida\u2019s 2018 Senate race as long as he remains a candidate.\u201d\n\nAnd on Wednesday, a judge will hear a request from Nelson\u2019s team that all absentee and provisional ballots that were tossed out over mismatched signatures be reexamined.\n\nDeja vu?\n\n\n\nAttorney Bill Scherer, representing Rick Scott's Senate campaign, speaks with the media at the Broward County supervisor of elections office on Saturday. (Joe Skipper/Getty Images)\n\nFor Americans of a certain age (older than 35?), the words \u201cFlorida\u201d and \u201crecount\u201d in the same sentence evoke memories of a protracted and bitter fight for the White House that ended up in the hands of the Supreme Court. Now, 18 years after Bush v. Gore, lawyers and media are descending on the Sunshine State for another too-close-to-call election.\n\nThat the allegations of voter fraud are focused on Broward County is especially reminiscent, given it was the site of the infamous \u201changing chads\u201d during the 2000 presidential recount.\n\nThere are even some familiar faces. As the Miami Herald pointed out, some lawyers from the 2000 recount are back on the job, including Bill Scherer, who represented George W. Bush and is now representing Scott, and Mitchell Berger, a lawyer for Al Gore who is now part of the Florida Democratic Party\u2019s legal team.\n\ncorrection: The Florida Senate race is being recounted by machine and will only go to a manual recount if by Thursday the margin is still under .25 percent.", "\n\nA meteor streaks over Washington in 2015. (Joel Kowsky/NASA)\n\nThe Leonid meteor shower peaks Friday and Saturday, with clouds clearing in time to see several shooting stars in the hours before dawn.\n\nThe Leonids have a history of producing amazing meteor storms. In 1966, the Leonid shower produced thousands of shooting stars an hour at the peak. But perhaps the most intense meteor shower in recorded history was the Leonids of 1833, when \u201cthe storm produced as many as 200,000 meteors per hour, startling some 19th-century observers into near-catatonic terror,\u201d according to astronomers at Slooh.com.\n\nThe meteor frequency of the 1833 Leonids \u201cwas estimated to be about half that of flakes of snow in an average snowstorm,\u201d according to 19th-century British astronomer Agnes Mary Clerke.\n\nDespite their magical appearance from the ground, meteor showers are little more than cosmic trash. Comets orbit the sun the same way Earth does. When they get close to the sun, the dirty space snowballs warm up a little and leave dusty trails behind. Earth, of course, is always traveling around the sun, and sometimes we collide with these trails of comet debris. The specks strike our atmosphere, then burn up, and we get to enjoy a shooting star show.\n\nThe Leonids\u2019 icy parental comet, Tempel-Tuttle, is a periodic comet discovered independently by German astronomer Ernst Wilhelm Tempel and by American astronomer Horace P. Tuttle during the winter of 1865-1866. Tuttle, an astronomer from the U.S. Naval Observatory, made his discovery on Jan. 5, 1866, from the observatory \u2014 which was then located at Foggy Bottom. Tuttle died in 1923, and he is buried in Falls Church, near Seven Corners, in an unmarked grave.\n\nAbout every 33 years, Comet Tempel-Tuttle makes a close approach to Earth and usually brings impressive meteoric showers with it. It happened last in 1998, and gazers enjoyed hundreds of shooting stars during the time of the Leonids. The comet\u2019s next close visit will be in 2031.\n\nThis year\u2019s shower won\u2019t be a meteor torrent, but you\u2019re much more likely to see a shooting star this week than an average night. The best chance you\u2019ll have is late at night after the moon sets. We\u2019re still a week away from a full moon, but the half-moon will be bright enough to wash out the sporadic meteors. If you can hold out until later in the night or in the dark hours before sunrise, you\u2019ll be rewarded with roughly 10 to 15 meteors per hour, according to the American Meteor Society.\n\nIn Washington, the best sky conditions will be Friday night into Saturday morning, when few clouds are expected after a week of cold, gray weather.\n\nMoonset times this week in Washington", "Stan Lee, a writer and editor often credited with helping American comics grow up by redefining the notion of a superhero, including the self-doubting Spider-Man, the bickering Fantastic Four, the swaggering Iron Man and the raging Incredible Hulk, died Nov. 12 at a hospital in Los Angeles. He was 95.\n\nAn attorney for Mr. Lee\u2019s daughter confirmed the death in a statement. The cause was not immediately available.\n\nMr. Lee\u2019s name became synonymous with the company that would become Marvel Comics, which he joined as a teenage assistant and stayed with for much of his adult life.\n\nAfter toiling in comics for 20 years as a self-described hack, on the verge of quitting the business, he was ordered by his boss to emulate a line of superheroes done by rival DC Comics. Mr. Lee\u2019s full-color, morally complex heroes helped foster a revival in a largely moribund profession.\n\nComics had entered a dark age after Senate hearings in the early 1950s that condemned the trade for contributing to juvenile delinquency. What followed was a \u201ccomics code\u201d to monitor standards and ban content deemed immoral and unsuitable for children.\n\nIn the \u201960s, Mr. Lee took a distinctly new approach to characters and setting, as well as to the very interaction with readers who had grown used to comics that were aimed solely at a younger audience and that featured flawless, square-jawed heroes who had uncomplicated morals.\n\nMichael Chabon, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of the comic-book-themed novel \u201cThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay,\u201d said in an interview that Mr. Lee\u2019s best-known characters were \u201cvain, pompous, conceited. . . . Everything that works in comic books today is indebted to him for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that Stan and the innovations he came up with saved the comic book and the superhero,\u201d Tom Brevoort, Marvel\u2019s senior vice president of publishing, told The Washington Post in 2011. \u201cBy crafting characters with feet of clay and personal problems \u2014 and not writing down to an audience that was perceived to be primarily 8-year-olds \u2014 Stan opened the doorway for more sophisticated and interesting treatments of any subject matter in comics. He made comics interesting and rel\u00adevant and fun again.\u201d\n\nLee told The Post in 2012: \u201cAll of our characters were freaks in their own way. The greatest example was with X-Men \u2014 they were hated because they were different. The idea I had, the underlying theme, was that just because somebody is different doesn\u2019t make them better. . . . That seems to be the worst thing in human nature.\u201d\n\nTension with Jack Kirby\n\nMuch of Mr. Lee\u2019s success was indebted to his Marvel partnership with artist and frequent co-creator Jack Kirby. Their first superheroes, appearing in 1961, were the Fantastic Four.\n\n1 of 67 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Notable deaths in 2018: Stan Lee, John McCain, Aretha Franklin and other famous faces we lost this year View Photos Remembering those who have died in 2018.

The Fantastic Four were constantly at odds with one another. Mister Fantastic was a boring scientist constantly interrupted by the rest of the group. One of the Fantastic Four, the Thing, looked like a monster and often acted like one, and he hated the powers that made him look that way.\n\nOther heroes came with their own weaknesses, such as the \u00adJekyll-and-Hyde-like Incredible Hulk, who could not control the anger that gave him his strength, and Daredevil, whose blindness helped develop other heightened senses. Iron Man was a billionaire industrialist modeled after Howard Hughes; his weakness was a piece of shrapnel dangerously close to his heart, acquired on a trip to Vietnam to inspect the weapons he produced for the war.\n\n(Mr. Lee wrote in his 2002 memoir, \u201cExcelsior!\u201d: \u201cDue to his injury, he always had to either wear the iron armor, or an iron chest plate he had fashioned for himself, to keep his heart beating. If that explanation doesn\u2019t sound medically correct, hey, he\u2019s a comicbook hero and I\u2019m not a cardiologist.\u201d)\n\nWith artist Steve Ditko, Mr. Lee created Spider-Man in 1962, of whom cartoonist and author Jules Feiffer said, \u201cHe took the anxiety and schlumpiness that had become part of the culture from the \u201960s on and put them into the character of a superhero.\u201d\n\nBesides giving the characters human personalities, the artists further attracted readers with the comics\u2019 realistic settings. While other heroes protected fictional cities such as Metropolis and Gotham, Mr. Lee\u2019s lived in his native New York.\n\nMr. Lee constantly addressed and engaged the readers. In his memoir, written with George Mair, he remembered one particular author\u2019s note: \u201cOn the cover I wrote something like, \u2018Look, this may not be one of the best stories we\u2019ve ever done, but we\u2019ve given you enough good ones so that you owe it to us to buy this lemon anyway.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cStan was the first writer to bring an ironic distance to the material,\u201d said Marvel writer Gerry Conway, as quoted in Tom Spurgeon and Jordan Raphael\u2019s \u201cStan Lee and the Rise and Fall of the American Comic Book\u201d (2003).\n\nBehind the scenes, Mr. Lee worked to foster a different kind of collaborative process with his artists.\n\nTraditionally, comics were drawn from a screenplay-like script provided by the writer. Instead, Mr. Lee said, he would offer his artists plot ideas and brainstorm with them. The artists would then draw the story, and he would later fill in dialogue and text.\n\nArtists in his \u201cbullpen,\u201d where the artists worked in proximity to each other and to him, were much more involved in the creative process. This became known as the Marvel Method.\n\nHe crisscrossed the country as a popular college speaker, visiting campus chapters of the official fan clubs he founded, the Merry Marvel Marching Society and later the Friends of Ol\u2019 Marvel. Marvel became \u2014 and remains \u2014 one of the best-selling comic book companies in the country. In 2009, the Walt Disney Co. reached an agreement to acquire Marvel Entertainment in a deal worth about $4 billion.\n\nMr. Lee has been criticized for not doing enough to acknowledge Kirby and Ditko\u2019s roles in creating Marvel\u2019s most popular characters. Marvel publicity and press coverage frequently played up Mr. Lee\u2019s role and minimized his collaborators.\n\nThey were minimized legally, as well. Historically, none of the creators had any ownership rights, not even Mr. Lee. Because there were no royalties, comic artists often struggled financially after they stopped working.\n\nIn the 1970s, Kirby attempted to get back some of his original artwork to help support his family and sued. Mr. Lee, who was Marvel\u2019s public face, refrained from taking an active role in the case. An elderly Kirby eventually received some of the art, years later, after agreeing to relinquish all claim to copyright.\n\nKirby and Mr. Lee had a falling-out. Kirby died in 1994.\n\n\u201cI made whatever I made because I was the editor . . . and I was the publisher and one-time president and chairman of the company,\u201d Mr. Lee told The Post in 2012. \u201cI was the scriptwriter. I made no more money than Jack, and at times he made more than I did. . . . If it hadn\u2019t been for those other guys \u2014 like [comic book artist] John Romita [Sr.] \u2014 who took over so many of the [comics], I don\u2019t think these comics\u201d would be as popular today.\n\n\u201cJack was great, and I have taken pains to say over and over again what a great collaborator he was and how much he contributed,\u201d Mr. Lee continued. \u201cBut even when he was alive, I was the guy doing the publicity. I was . . . the guy boosting Marvel on the front lines. Jack was the voice of Jack Kirby, and at times, he left to work at DC, and when it served his interests better, he came back to Marvel.\u201d\n\nTook pen name in his teens\n\nStanley Martin Lieber was born in New York City on Dec. 28, 1922, the eldest son of Romanian Jewish immigrants. His father was a dress cutter who was frequently out of work.\n\nMr. Lee came by his pen name as a teenager. He claimed he changed his name not because of anti-Semitism, like many comic book artists, but because he wanted to preserve his real name to write a real book.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Mr. Lee took a job with Timely publications, a company that published Marvel and was owned by his cousin-in-law Martin Goodman. He was hired by Timely editor Joe Simon, who with Kirby co-created Captain America.\n\nDuring World War II, Mr. Lee served in the Army and spent three years in New Jersey writing scripts for training films. After his discharge, he continued spinning out science-fiction and monster comics for Timely, which was renamed Atlas.\n\nIn 1947, he married Joan Boocock, a British-born hat model. Mr. Lee credited his wife with pushing him to create the Fantastic Four instead of leaving Marvel in frustration at midcareer. His breakthrough against the industry\u2019s self-imposed comics code came in 1971, when the government asked him to produce a Spider-Man story line that came down harshly on drug use.\n\n[Stan Lee\u2019s alleged elder-abuse and money issues have grown. Here\u2019s how we got to this point.]\n\nThe code had a zero-tolerance policy for drugs, even in a negative light, but Marvel ignored the regulations, published without the seal of approval and saw no change in sales. Comic books across the industry stopped following the code\u2019s guidelines.\n\nMr. Lee moved from editor to publisher in 1972 and then moved to Hollywood around 1980, attempting with little success to attain cinematic respectability for his characters. The few projects that came to fruition, such as \u201cHoward the Duck\u201d (1986) and \u201cThe Punisher\u201d (1989), were critical and commercial failures.\n\nIn 1999, Mr. Lee entered the Internet age with the company Stan Lee Media, which produced Web cartoons and briefly gave Mr. Lee a fortune worth $100 million on paper. The company collapsed in 2001 amid allegations of a massive scam run by Mr. Lee\u2019s partner, Peter F. Paul, who turned out to be a felon. Paul fled to Brazil but eventually returned to the United States and pleaded guilty to securities fraud.\n\nIn 2002, \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire, opened at the box office and eventually grossed more than $800 million worldwide. Citing a previously ignored line in his contract, Mr. Lee sued Marvel for 10 percent of the profits in what he told Variety was \u201cthe friendliest lawsuit in the world.\u201d He won the case in 2005. Retaining his lifetime contract with Marvel, he started a new comic company, POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment.\n\nThe first X-Men and Spider-Man films turned Marvel characters into box-office juggernauts. In the past decade alone, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has grossed more than $17.5 billion globally.\n\nIn 2008, he received the National Medal of Arts, the highest honor given to artists by the U.S. government. Yet his final years were fraught with legal tensions. His circle of business partners and confidants had shifted tumultuously since his wife, who often guarded his interests, died in 2017. Not long after, court documents showed that the Los Angeles Police Department was investigating claims of elder abuse against Mr. Lee that involved a road convention manager, a memorabilia dealer and an excommunicated caregiver, among others.\n\nYet in April 2018, he gave an interview to the New York Times in which he said that \u201clife is pretty good\u201d and added that he had been \u201cvery careless with money.\u201d\n\nSurvivors include his daughter, Joan Celia \u201cJ.C.\u201d Lee; and a brother, comic book artist and writer Larry Lieber. Another daughter, Jan, died days after her birth in 1953.\n\nMr. Lee, who has had cameos in many Marvel-based films, was known for an economy of humility. As a teenage boss at Marvel, he would sit on a file cabinet and yell, \u201cI am God!\u201d at his artists sitting below. In his memoir, he said, \u201cIf I may be totally candid, I\u2019m my own biggest fan.\u201d", "\n\nElection workers place ballots into electronic counting machines Sunday at the Broward County Supervisor of Elections office in Lauderhill, Fla.

Republicans lead in the biggest races \u2014 the gubernatorial and Senate contests \u2014 and that\u2019s prompting GOP officials and lawmakers to line up with their partisan allies and cry foul.\n\nThose cries, in the absence of evidence to back up any allegations of voter fraud or other wrongdoing, are dredging up fears that the votes of primarily people of color will not be properly counted. Concerns about protecting the right to vote of people of color have existed since some states put laws in place after the passing of the 15th Amendment, which guaranteed black men the right to vote. These anxieties increased in 2013 after the Supreme Court ruled against upholding what is considered the crux of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nThough there is no evidence of foul play, President Trump suggested that some ballots shouldn\u2019t be counted. He has gone as far as to say that the Republican candidates should simply be able to assume the seats.\n\nThe Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged.

Kupp is out for the season after tearing a ligament in his left knee. Coach Sean McVay on Monday, Nov. 12, 2018, confirmed the injury for Kupp, who led the Rams in yards receiving last season. Kupp was hurt on a noncontact play during the Rams\u2019 36-31 victory over the Seattle Seahawks. (Bill Feig, FIle/Associated Press)\n\nTHOUSAND OAKS, Calif. \u2014 Los Angeles receiver Cooper Kupp is out for the season after tearing a ligament in his left knee, depriving the Rams\u2019 offense of a major contributor heading into a showdown with Kansas City.\n\nCoach Sean McVay on Monday confirmed the ACL injury for Kupp, who led the Rams in yards receiving last season. Kupp is likely to have surgery this week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge loss for our football team,\u201d McVay said. \u201cHe\u2019s such an important part of what we do, and a great football player, great person. It\u2019s tough, but fortunately we\u2019ve got guys that are ready to step up.\u201d\n\nKupp has 40 catches for 566 yards and six touchdowns this season, providing reliable hands in the slot and a knack for big catches. The former third-round pick from Eastern Washington has been a key contributor to McVay\u2019s high-octane passing offense in both of his NFL seasons.\n\nHis absence will be felt right away by the Rams (9-1), who will be without one of Jared Goff\u2019s most familiar targets when they face the Chiefs (9-1) in Mexico City next Monday night in one of the biggest games of the NFL\u2019s regular season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a valuable piece of our team, and a guy we\u2019ll miss,\u201d Goff said. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough guy (with) a tough family, and I know he\u2019ll come out stronger through it all.\u201d\n\nKupp was hurt on a play with minimal contact Sunday in in the fourth quarter of the Rams\u2019 36-31 victory over the Seattle Seahawks. An MRI exam confirmed a torn ligament for Kupp, who already missed two games last month with a sprained left knee after going down awkwardly on a horse-collar tackle by Darian Stewart in Denver.\n\nMcVay is optimistic about the Rams\u2019 ability to fill Kupp\u2019s role with a mix of receivers.\n\nRobert Woods, who leads the Rams with 55 catches, is likely to play more frequently in the slot. Fellow starter Brandin Cooks, who leads LA with 857 yards receiving, is likely to get more balls thrown his way after catching a season-high 10 passes against the Seahawks.\n\nAnd second-year backup Josh Reynolds is certain to get more playing time, particularly against the Chiefs.\n\n\u201cJosh Reynolds has definitely demonstrated he\u2019s more than capable,\u201d McVay said. \u201cHe is a starting-caliber player, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do moving forward.\u201d\n\nReynolds has just seven catches this season and just 18 receptions in his 26 career games, but the former Texas A&M star has earned the Los Angeles offense\u2019s trust while filling in for Kupp earlier this season. At 6-foot-3, he also provides a different size matchup on the outside compared to the smaller Cooks and Woods.\n\n\u201cI was sorry to hear about (Kupp) like everybody else,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cI\u2019m just doing my best to fill in there.\u201d\n\nThe Rams also could get receiver Pharoh Cooper back in their lineup soon. Last season\u2019s Pro Bowl kick returner has been sidelined since the season opener with an ankle injury, but McVay indicated the Rams are likely to make a decision this week on activating Cooper from injured reserve.\n\n\u201cHe would physically be able to play right now,\u201d McVay said. \u201cIn terms of if we decide to activate him back, those are a couple things that we have to talk through.\u201d\n\nThe Rams have been largely healthy this season, with a few glaring exceptions. Along with Kupp\u2019s struggles and Cooper\u2019s season-long absence, Los Angeles has been without cornerback Aqib Talib for the past seven games due to an ankle injury that required surgery.\n\nTalib said Monday that he still hopes to return when the Rams face Detroit on Dec. 2 in their first game back from their bye week.\n\nTalib also praised his replacements in the secondary and had encouraging words for fellow starter Marcus Peters, who criticized himself after last week\u2019s loss to New Orleans.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just part of playing DB,\u201d Talib said. \u201cI only know one DB who was like perfect all the time, and that\u2019s Prime (Deion Sanders).

Another documentary film, \u201cUnlikely,\u201d shows us five nontraditional students in Akron, Ohio; Atlanta; Boston; and Los Angeles as they fight to win a second chance at a college degree.\n\nThis post about both films and what they tell us about a slice of American life today was written by Liz Willen, a veteran journalist and editor of the Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

(More on how to watch here.)\n\nTheir stories starkly illustrate the fragile support system that low-income students in public schools with few resources encounter, every step of the way, as they navigate getting into college and paying for it.\n\nFootball star Enoch, activist Christine and immigrant Karoline are captivating; you can\u2019t help rooting for them. Yet as all three tackle family problems, academic demands and their own college dreams, they are simultaneously helping other students try to get into college, as well.\n\nThe roadblocks they face are exacerbated by the severe lack of guidance counselors at the public schools where students most need help and support for their higher education quests.\n\nAll three seniors featured in the film embark on their fraught and uncertain journeys while volunteering with CARA (College Access: Research & Action), a New York City-based nonprofit that helps give first-generation and low-income college students support toward getting into college \u2014 and staying there. They trained for more than 70 hours for the positions.\n\nAnd the obstacles don\u2019t stop after high school. \u201cUnlikely,\u201d another new documentary related to college attainment, stems from the experience of Jaye Fenderson, a former admissions officer at Columbia University who became concerned by what she saw as the exclusionary nature of her Ivy League alma mater.\n\nAt the start of \u201cUnlikely,\u201d Fenderson is seen rejecting piles of applications in her office at Columbia, marking folders with a giant \u201cU,\u201d for \u201cunlikely to be admitted.\u201d Last year, only 2,214 applicants out of more than 40,203 got in.\n\nAfter she leaves Columbia, Fenderson wonders what more equitable and affordable higher-ed options might look like.

Their struggles to achieve a better life illuminate endless barriers that keep so many first-generation and low-income students from finishing college. These are stories that don\u2019t tend to make headlines, much less movies.\n\n\u201cPersonal Statement\u201d stakes out a position, in partnership with the Center for Postsecondary Readiness and Success at American University. The filmmakers started a post-film impact campaign aimed at building more resources to help close the college guidance gap.\n\nThe film itself wisely stays closely connected with the three students and their stories. I was so eager to learn where Enoch, Christine and Karoline landed that I tracked down a post-screening conversation to find out.\n\nThe film\u2019s campaign for more guidance counselors correctly hits a nerve. New York City public schools reported last year that only 2,880 guidance counselors served the system\u2019s 1.1 million students; or one for every 348 students. (City officials recently said that the ratio has declined over the last four years by about 28 students.)\n\nA typical college counselor in a U.S. public high school is responsible for 482 students, while the American School Counselor Association recommends a ratio of no more than 250 to 1, along with a social worker \u2014 and even more support for schools with large numbers of high-needs students.\n\nDressner said she was motivated to make \u201cPersonal Statement\u201d after she learned that \u201cyoung people were taking it upon themselves to close the college guidance gap in their schools.\u201d\n\nSome of the film\u2019s best scenes come as the students are seen helping one another untangle the barrage of baffling forms and documents they need. They hug and cheer and support one another while anticipating life-changing admissions decisions.\n\nThey struggle mightily with the dreaded FAFSA, the financial aid form that\u2019s supposed to have been simplified but somehow is still driving my household and countless others nuts.

(Michael Reynolds/EPA-EFE)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nPresident Trump has proved beyond a reasonable doubt he is incapable of learning or living up to the requirements of the job. In the aftermath of last week\u2019s elections, Republicans each day show beyond a reasonable doubt that they do not intend to check him, break with him or, certainly, impeach and remove him. What then do Republicans or ex-Republicans or people who usually voted Republicans do in the new political order in which the GOP has been reduced to a party of know-nothingism and blatant racism? I\u2019d suggest there are three options.\n\nFirst, such Americans can try to mount a primary challenge \u2014 to Trump and his worst flunkies in the House and Senate (e.g., Sen. Lindsey O. Graham of South Carolina). The benefit of challenging House representatives and senators is that it might exert some pressure on incumbents to act more responsibly now. If some \u201cindependent conservatives\u201d prevail, there would be a toehold from which to battle against Trump and Trumpism from within. The idea of the GOP nominating a Nikki Haley or a John Kasich sounds enticing. However, let\u2019s be honest: Primary-voting Republicans love Trump. If anything, with so many voters in the suburbs abandoning the GOP, the task gets even harder. The GOP is shrinking and getting more Trumpized. It is now a party of cultists.\n\nAnother option is to mount independent conservative campaigns for the House, Senate and presidency. A Kasich or a Brian Sandoval or a Jeff Flake would offer a center-right candidate running on a reform platform. The challenges are obvious \u2014 fundraising, ballot access, the institutional advantages of the major two parties. Nevertheless, I have come to see that this has a greater chance of success than trying to wrestle the GOP away from Trump. Could conservatives try this and an internal primary challenge? There is only so much money, organizational strength and interest in carving out an alternative on the right; my strong suggestion is to pick one of these strategies, at least one at a time.\n\nThe third option is to at least for 2020 join with centrist Democrats (who did very well in 2017 and 2018) to push for a moderate presidential nominee. The nightmare scenario for these voters would be Trump vs. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). However, what if the choice was Trump vs. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock? Trump vs. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper? Trump vs. Former New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu? The problem here is twofold \u2014 Republican refugees are unlikely to make a difference as a voting bloc in the Democratic Party primary and, worse, their support might kill the chances of a moderate.\n\nThere are some combinations here \u2014 run a primary challenge to Trump and then go third party if it fails. (Be prepared to challenge sore-loser rules in states.) Get a third-party contender out there to induce Democrats to nominate a more centrist candidate in order to capture the middle of the political spectrum.\n\nSitting here in 2018, I do not have a perfect answer. The good news is that disaffected Republicans don\u2019t have to decide this moment what to do. Instead they should act methodically, polling specific names in a possible GOP primary, feeling out donors, assembling the ballot access paperwork well in advance of 2020, speaking to potential conservative independents and to those moderate Democrats who may or may not want their support, building or borrowing a grassroots networks of supporters in 50 states, and seeking advice from both nonpartisan groups (e.g., No Labels). There is plenty to do, and it would be helpful if independent conservatives could operate if not as one group then as a loose association of groups with a common purpose: defeating Trump and Trumpism.

He talked about pheasant hunting and his \u201cpatented pheasant noodle soup\u201d sprinkled with whole jalape\u00f1o peppers he had grown himself. Around the 1:20 mark, King joked that he\u2019d have to get some \u201cdirt from Mexico\u201d to grow his next batch of peppers because they didn\u2019t have enough bite.\n\n\u201cTrust me, it\u2019s already on its way,\u201d a woman quipped, appearing to refer to the caravan of Central American migrants traveling from Mexico to the U.S. border.\n\nKing engaged, saying: \u201cWell, yeah, there\u2019s plenty of dirt. It\u2019s coming from the West Coast, too. And a lot of other places, besides. This is the most dirt we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nThe following day, on Election Day, Weekly Standard assistant opinion editor Adam Rubenstein, who was covering the campaign event and has been critical of King, published an article about the conversation. It included a transcript but not the audio.\n\nIn a statement to The Washington Post on Monday evening, Sarah Stevens, King\u2019s chief of staff, accused the Weekly Standard of misrepresenting the congressman\u2019s comments and conjuring a false story. Stevens said the congressman believed the supporter was referring to dirt coming from the \u201cleftist media,\u201d not immigrants. In response to the supporter, King repeated similar comments he had been making during the campaign \u2014 that the \u201cleftist media\u201d and liberal multibillionaires from coastal states were trying to smear him, Stevens said.\n\nThe magazine stood by its story, saying it quoted King at length to provide readers with context. Claiming King was referring to the media is \u201cabsurd\u201d given the context of the conversation, during which the media was never mentioned, according to an editor\u2019s note at the end of Rubenstein\u2019s story.\n\n[Following the Pittsburgh attack, Rep. Steve King\u2019s Iowa supporters brush aside concern about his white nationalist views]\n\nDays after Rubenstein\u2019s story was published, King and the Weekly Standard engaged in a public Twitter fight over what he actually meant.\n\nThe Weekly Standard has joined the HuffPost \u201cat the bottom of the lying journalistic gutter,\u201d the congressman tweeted in the wee morning hours Friday.\n\nTo which Stephen Hayes, the magazine\u2019s editor in chief, replied: \u201cThe Weekly Standard remains, proudly, a reporting-driven conservative journal of opinion. \u2026 There are no lies, willful or otherwise. \u2026 Our reporter wouldn\u2019t focus on your bigotry if you weren\u2019t a bigot.\u201d\n\nKing replied later by castigating Hayes for defending his reporter. He suggested that the magazine refused to publish the audio because it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nHours later, on Saturday, the Weekly Standard did release it, along with a column from Hayes.\n\n\u201cSo, King claimed our reporter lied. He didn\u2019t. He claimed we didn\u2019t have a recording. We did. He insisted we refused to release the audio. Untrue,\u201d Hayes wrote.\n\nThe congressman, who shares President Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration policies, has a long history of inflammatory rhetoric against immigrants, minorities and the media and has peddled conspiratorial views about \u201cwhite genocide.\u201d\n\n[Rep. King met with far-right Austrians on trip funded by Holocaust memorial group]\n\nHe has compared immigrants to dogs. He said immigrants have \u201ccalves the size of cantaloupes\u201d because they haul drugs across the desert. He tweeted a cartoon depicting President Barack Obama wearing a turban. He retweeted a self-described Nazi sympathizer. He endorsed a white nationalist mayoral candidate who questioned whether immigration is causing \u201cwhite genocide.\u201d He said he hoped Supreme Court Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor \u201cwill elope to Cuba.\u201d He reportedly attacked the National Republican Congressional Committee for backing a gay candidate.\n\nHe met with members of the far-right Austrian Freedom Party, which has historical Nazi ties, during a trip financed by a Holocaust memorial group. In the aftermath of the mass shooting inside a synagogue in Pittsburgh, King defended associating with the Austrian party and said: \u201cIf they were in America pushing the platform that they push, they would be Republicans.\u201d\n\nOn election night, King barred the Des Moines Register, Iowa\u2019s largest newspaper, from covering his event, calling the paper a \u201cleftist propaganda media outlet.\u201d\n\nKing has been in Congress since 2003, representing Iowa\u2019s northwest quadrant. Once on the fringe, King has moved further into the mainstream after Trump\u2019s election.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill have largely stayed silent about King. But in late October, Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), the National Republican Congressional Committee chairman, criticized King for espousing extreme views online.\n\n\u201cCongressman Steve King\u2019s recent comments, actions, and retweets are completely inappropriate.

(Ludovic Marin/Pool/AP)\n\nFacebook will open its doors for French regulators to study its approach to combating hate speech online, marking the latest attempt by governments around the world to figure out new ways to thwart toxic, derogatory content from spreading on social media.\n\nUnder a six-month arrangement announced on Monday, French investigators will monitor Facebook\u2019s policies and tools for stopping posts and photos that attack people on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sexuality or gender. From there, aides to French President Emmanuel Macron hope to determine \u201cthe necessary regulatory and legislative developments\u201d to fight online hate speech, a government official said.\n\nIn recent months, France and its fellow European countries have adopted a much harder line against Facebook and its social-media peers, demanding they police their platforms more aggressively to stop a range of digital ills \u2014 including conspiracy theories, fake news and terrorist propaganda. Macron pressed Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg on the issue when the two met in Paris earlier this year.\n\nOn Monday, though, Facebook described the new French effort on hate speech as \u201cco-regulatory.\"\n\n\u201cAs Mark Zuckerberg has said, with the Internet growing in importance in people's lives we believe that there will be need for regulation,\u201d added Nick Clegg, Facebook's new vice president for global affairs. \u201cThe best way to ensure that any regulation is smart and works for people is by governments, regulators and businesses working together to learn from each other and explore ideas.\u201d\n\nFacebook and its Silicon Valley counterparts, including Google-owned YouTube and Twitter, generally outlaw content that attacks people on the basis of their identity, endorses discrimination or threatens violence. In recent months, they\u2019ve hired thousands of employees \u2014 and invested in new machine-learning tools \u2014 to spot and remove racism, anti-Semitism and other forms of hate speech from their services.\n\nBut their challenge in stamping out such content hasn\u2019t abated: Between Jan. 1 and March 31, Facebook said it had taken action against roughly 2.5 million posts, photos and other kinds of content for violating its rules against hate speech, according to a report released earlier this year. That marked a spike from the previous quarter, though Facebook attributed the rise to \u201cimprovements in our detection technology.\"\n\nIn the United States, hate speech generally is protected under the First Amendment, so members of Congress have been hesitant to write a new law even amid broad, bipartisan disgust with the spread of hate-tinged content online.\n\nIn Europe, though, there\u2019s been a greater appetite to regulate. Germany, for example, began enforcing new rules in January that fine tech giants for failing to take down hate speech within a day. The European Union, meanwhile, recently has proposed levying steep penalties on sites that fail to spot and take down terrorist content within an hour.\n\nOn Monday, France\u2019s Macron also heralded governments in Europe and around the world that have signed onto high-level principles that call for greater trust and safety online, including clamping down on malicious actors who are trying to undermine \u201celectoral processes through malicious cyber activities.\u201d The United States does not appear to have signed the \u201cParis Call,\u201d and the White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cToday the Internet is much better used by extremes, authoritarian regimes or terrorist propaganda than by our democracies,\u201d Macron said about the document Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s a reality against which we must fight.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s new efforts come in the wake of Macron\u2019s earlier attempt to combat \u201cfake news\u201d through a new bill adopted in July. His 2017 presidential campaign had been the target of a major data dump as well as a coordinated misinformation campaign, and the subject has been a priority for Macron since he took office.\n\nThe \u201cfake news law,\u201d as it has come to be called, will allow French judges to halt the publication of information determined to be either false or \u201cimplausible.\u201d When the law was introduced in June, it ran into sharp criticism by those on the right and the left who insisted that it would infringe on the freedom of speech and could, under the wrong leadership, be used to create a modern \u201cthought police.\u201d\n\nA fairly extensive body of hate speech restrictions already exists under French law. The country has prohibited the incitement of racial hatred since 1972, and a separate provision, known as the Gayssot law, criminalized Holocaust denial in 1990.", "Michelle Obama\u2019s \u201cBecoming\u201d is quickly becoming the biggest book of the year.\n\nThe former first lady\u2019s memoir is set to be released Tuesday, but details about the book started appearing in the media last week, and huge numbers of readers have already expressed an interest.\n\nBarnes & Noble announced today that Obama\u2019s memoir has sold more preorders than any other adult book since Harper Lee\u2019s \u201cGo Set a Watchman\u201d was published in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen tremendous demand for \u2018Becoming\u2019 before it has even hit the shelves,\u201d said Liz Harwell, senior director of merchandising at Barnes & Noble. \u201cOur stores across the country are ready for huge demand tomorrow for what will likely be the biggest book of the season during what has been a blockbuster publishing calendar.\u201d\n\nThat interest is only likely to grow.\n\nOprah Winfrey announced today she has chosen \u201cBecoming\u201d for her book club. She will broadcast an interview with Obama and run an excerpt of the memoir in O magazine.\n\n\u201cThis book is everything you wanted to know and so much you didn\u2019t even know you wanted to know,\u201d Winfrey told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s so well-written I can hear her voice; I can hear her expressions; I can feel her emotion. What she allows us to see is how she was able to discover, define and then refine her voice.\u201d\n\nThe popular TV talk show host will also help Obama launch her memoir at an appearance in Chicago on Tuesday night at the United Center. Tickets to the event, which run as high as $2,750, sold out quickly. It is the first stop on a 10-city book tour across the country.\n\nAnd Ellen DeGeneres plans to have Obama on her show on Thursday.\n\nAmong the memoir\u2019s most newsworthy content, Obama writes that she blames Donald Trump for the way he continued to question whether her husband was born in the United States long after the \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy had been discredited. \u201cIt was also dangerous, deliberately meant to stir up the wingnuts and kooks,\u201d she writes. \u201cWhat if someone with an unstable mind loaded a gun and drove to Washington? What if that person went looking for our girls? Donald Trump, with his loud and reckless innuendos, was putting my family\u2019s safety at risk. And for this I\u2019d never forgive him.\u201d\n\nAs he usually does in response to critics\u2019 books, President Trump has used his bully pulpit to draw even more attention to \u201cBecoming\u201d by firing back. On Friday, he told reporters outside the White House that publishers always insist authors come up with a few controversial claims. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll give you a little controversy back,\u201d the president said. \u201cI\u2019ll never forgive [President Obama] for what he did to our United States military by not funding it properly. It was depleted. Everything was old and tired, and I came in and I had to fix it.\u201d\n\nHere in Washington, booksellers are bracing for major interest in the book. Bradley Graham, co-owner of Politics and Prose, said, \u201cGiven the heavy demand that we saw for other big political books this year \u2014 most notably by Wolff, Comey and Woodward \u2014 we\u2019ve stocked up and have over 1,000 copies of \u2018Becoming\u2019 on hand, with hundreds more coming soon.\u201d\n\nObama has two book appearances planned for the capital this month: Nov. 17 and Nov. 25 at Capital One Arena.\n\nSuch heavy promotion here and around the country is essential for the publisher.

He tweets:\n\nThe Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2018\n\nWe should note that this is the talk of authoritarians; it shows contempt for the office of the president, whom the Constitution designates to \u201cto take care\u201d that the nation\u2019s laws are faithfully executed. It\u2019s also a frightful peek at what he might do in 2020 should the vote not go his way.\n\nTrump\u2019s appointment of an unqualified, radical political hack, Matthew G. Whitaker, as acting attorney general likewise shows his disdain for the rule of law and proclivity to impede or even crush the Russia probe. We should be worried that he is spoiling for a constitutional crisis that can rally his base.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to revoke the press pass for Jim Acosta is a blatant violation of the First Amendment. (First Amendment guru Floyd Abrams confirms that CNN and Acosta would have a strong lawsuit, an option reportedly under consideration.) Once more, Trump violates his oath to preserve and protect the Constitution.\n\nCombined with evidence of obstruction of justice and evidence he directed Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance rules, these new actions would be ample grounds for impeachment. However, observe the deafening silence of Republicans \u2014 indeed, their noxious attempts to join in calls to foreclose a legally mandated recount. While impeachment in a Democratic House would be both justified and doable, removal by the GOP-controlled Senate would not be remotely possible.\n\nThis does not mean the actions should be ignored. To the contrary, congressional oversight should expose the president\u2019s wrongdoing, and the House should certainly sanction him for it. Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s report should provide avenues for prosecution after Trump leaves office.\n\nHowever, from a political perspective, Democrats should keep in mind their audience \u2014 voters in all those House districts they took back, in the Rust Belt and Upper Midwest where they prevailed in governor and Senate races, in states whose GOP senators are on the ballot in 2020, and every region and demographic group with persuadable Americans. They must hammer away at the simple proposition that Trump is unfit to govern and Republicans who are too afraid to stand up to him cannot be trusted with power.\n\nMeanwhile, the press and the country at large should keep in mind that Trump acts out when he is weak, humiliated and cornered. He\u2019s all those things right now:\n\nHis performance in Europe was panned.\n\nThe election results get worse for Republicans with each passing day.\n\nHis great North Korea diplomacy, contrary to the gullible pundits and political spinners, was a bust. (He was snookered.)\n\nWe now have two major Middle East problems \u2014 Iran and out-of-control Sunni despots who think (not unreasonably) they can lead him around by the nose.\n\nHe is not winning the trade war, and it may be one of many factors leading to an economic pullback before the 2020 election.\n\nMueller plows ahead, with possibly more indictments (e.g., Roger Stone, Donald Trump Jr.). The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York (aided by Michael Cohen\u2019s cooperation) has its own case(s) to pursue against Trump and/or his helpmates.\n\nObamacare is here to stay. It\u2019s more popular than ever, and red America has fallen in love with Medicaid expansion.\n\nTrump\u2019s finances are no longer protected from scrutiny, nor are his daughter and son-in-law\u2019s.\n\nIn sum, we should continue to tally Trump\u2019s constitutional offenses just as we keep a running count of his lies. However, these offenses are part of a bigger picture of a failing president and a party incapable of breaking with him.

Jason Lewis (R-Minn.), who lost his seat in last week\u2019s midterm elections, is coming under fire for a Wall Street Journal op-ed in which he blames Republicans\u2019 defeat at the ballot box on the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.).\n\nIn the piece, titled \u201cWho Lost the House? John McCain,\u201d Lewis makes a novel argument: that McCain\u2019s famous thumbs-down vote last year against a \u201cskinny\u201d repeal of the Affordable Care Act doomed Republicans by making it more difficult for them to counter Democratic claims that GOP lawmakers would do away with protections for those with preexisting conditions.\n\nThe catch, of course, is that if Republicans had ultimately succeeded in their efforts to repeal the health-care law, they would have done just that.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party lost its House majority on July 28, 2017, when Sen. John McCain ended the party\u2019s seven-year quest to repeal ObamaCare,\u201d Lewis writes in the op-ed. \u201cHouse leadership had done an admirable job herding cats. On the second try, we passed the American Health Care Act in May. Then McCain\u2019s inscrutable vote against the Senate\u2019s \u2018skinny repeal\u2019 killed the reform effort.\u201d\n\nHe argues that McCain\u2019s vote prompted a \u201cgreen wave\u201d of donations that Democrats and their allies used to fund ads hammering Republicans on preexisting conditions, which Lewis describes as \u201cthe Democrats\u2019 most potent attack in the midterms.\u201d\n\nMcCain died of brain cancer in August.\n\nLewis\u2019s op-ed, like the arguments made by President Trump and other Republicans in the lead-up to last week\u2019s election, ignores the fact that the 2010 health-care law passed with solely Democratic votes; it also neglects the eight years of votes, legal efforts and bureaucratic moves by Republicans to gut the law.\n\n\u201cThis is abhorrent,\u201d Meghan McCain, the senator\u2019s daughter, said in a Monday morning tweet responding to the op-ed.\n\nLewis, who won election to the House in 2016 and was defeated last week by Democrat Angie Craig, has a history of incendiary remarks, particularly related to race and gender. In a 2012 appearance on his syndicated radio show, Lewis lamented that it was no longer acceptable to call women \u201csluts.\u201d\n\nHe also argued that women who voted for President Barack Obama were \u201cguided by emotion, not reason,\u201d and mocked women who had been subjected to sexual harassment.

The wildfire money would probably be attached to the spending legislation.\n\nLeahy said there will need to be additional disaster relief money for ongoing hurricane recovery in Texas, Florida and elsewhere, including Puerto Rico, where Trump has also criticized the government response. The administration has not made an official disaster funding request to Congress, but Leahy said Democrats would push for congressional action anyway.\n\n[The weather and climate behind the California infernos that wrecked Paradise and torched Malibu]\n\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s going to have to be money for a number of natural disasters that occurred throughout the country; it\u2019s not just the fires in California,\u201d Leahy said. \u201cAnd what I would not agree to is have one face off against another.

Like his teammate Josh Norman, who voiced his disappointment with Washington\u2019s home crowds after Sunday\u2019s game, Swearinger is less than thrilled that the Redskins\u2019 next game is at FedEx Field.\n\n\u201cI would rather play on the road, too,\u201d Swearinger told 106.7 The Fan\u2019s Grant Paulsen and Danny Rouhier on Monday. \u201cMost definitely.\u201d\n\nVictory Lap!@JungleBoi_Swagg went around half the stadium to high-5 fans after the #Redskins win.\n\n\n\nI struggled to keep up. ;) @nbcwashington pic.twitter.com/p9fV0XUI2p \u2014 dckerNBC4 (@dckerNBC4) November 11, 2018\n\nThe Redskins are 3-1 on the road, with their three wins coming against teams with a combined record of 6-20. They\u2019re 3-2 at home, including wins over the Packers and Panthers. Asked what he prefers about playing away from FedEx Field, Swearinger mentioned that it\u2019s easier to communicate with his fellow defensive backs. (That may be true in Tampa Bay and at half-empty MetLife Stadium in the Meadowlands, but the Redskins had plenty of communication breakdowns during their trip to the Superdome last month.)\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about fans booing you,\u201d Swearinger continued. \u201cYou ain\u2019t gotta worry about seeing the other team\u2019s jersey everywhere. You know it\u2019s going to be the other team\u2019s jerseys, because you\u2019re away. Home games, that\u2019s some of the worst things I\u2019ve seen. I\u2019ve played on four different teams, never seen it that bad, with other team\u2019s jerseys in the stands, the boos, whatever it may be. I\u2019ve never been a part of nothing like that.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Norman also mentioned the boos and large numbers of visiting team fans among the reasons he doesn\u2019t feel all warm and fuzzy when Washington plays at home.\n\n\u201cWe go into the homestands, and it\u2019s like an open bubble,\u201d Norman said. \u201cLike the other team\u2019s turf or something. You hear more of them than you do us. Then if something bad happens, they suck. They sit back in their seat, and they boo. I don\u2019t know. This year, I\u2019m starting to see that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt affects you to the point where you want to get the crowd involved,\u201d Swearinger said. \u201cI recall when I was in [Arizona] or in Houston, I would always waive my hands up, just to get the crowd up. But you know if I do it here, it\u2019s like blah. . . . They don\u2019t see us getting the crowd up. I guess that\u2019ll take time because we haven\u2019t won, but you can\u2019t really say that because I\u2019ve been in Houston and AZ where they haven\u2019t won, where those die-hard fans would go out win, lose or draw. It\u2019s no excuse of losing. Every NFL team loses. No NFL team wins the Super Bowl every year.\u201d\n\nWith all due respect to Swearinger, who is correct that no team wins a championship every year, the Texans have won four division titles and three playoff games since 2011, and the Cardinals have won five playoff games and been to a Super Bowl since 2008. The Redskins have three playoff wins over the past 26 years and happen to play their home games in one of the league\u2019s worst and least accessible stadiums. Norman and Swearinger make valid criticisms of the game day atmosphere at FedEx Field, but there are good reasons that more and more Redskins fans have decided to stay away.\n\nSpeaking in the Redskins locker room on Monday, linebacker Mason Foster suggested that the fans at FedEx Field have provided a home-field advantage at times.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the fans play a big part in the way defenses can play and the atmosphere out there,\u201d Foster said. \u201cLike the Dallas game, the Panthers game, you get those guys going crazy in the stands, it\u2019s hard for quarterbacks to communicate. It\u2019s hard for them to audible at the line. When you get that going, I think it\u2019s a tough place to play at FedEx.\u201d\n\nSwearinger struggled to explain why Redskins fans haven\u2019t packed the stands this season, even with Washington surprisingly atop the NFC East.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know,\u201d Swearinger said. \u201cI always say I guess because we\u2019re in three different states. We\u2019re the Washington Redskins, but we don\u2019t play in Washington; we play in Maryland. We live in Virginia, so I don\u2019t know if that has anything to do with it, if the states matter. . . . I don\u2019t know if we have that full support of loyalty [from] the fans. We may have a lot of Redskins fans, but the loyalty, I don\u2019t feel the loyalty.\u201d\n\nAfter the Redskins' 38-14 blowout loss to the Falcons at FedEx Field in Week 9, former Redskins cornerback Fred Smoot offered a theory that rings true. Essentially, it\u2019s going to take more than half a season of winning more than they lose for these Redskins to overcome the bitterness that\u2019s festered among the fan base over the past quarter-century.\n\n\u201cI think my generation of Redskins ruined it for these Redskins,\u201d Smoot, who spent seven seasons in Washington between 2001 and 2009, said, according to Paulsen. \u201cPeople came out to watch us play and we had no chance to win.\u201d\n\nFred Smoot, randomly, while looking out the window, searching for life's answers at @NBCSWashington just now: \"I think my generation of Redskins ruined it for these Redskins. People came out to watch us play and we had no chance to win.\" \u2014 Grant Paulsen (@granthpaulsen) November 4, 2018\n\nSwearinger, though, dismissed that idea, arguing that fandom shouldn\u2019t depend on wins and losses.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been liking teams since I was a kid, regardless of their record,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still going to be that fan, I\u2019m still going to be die-hard for the Lakers. I\u2019m not going to change that. That\u2019s how I feel about basketball. . . . That\u2019s just how I see it. If you\u2019re a fan of something, you can\u2019t be a bandwagon, you can\u2019t jump off that bandwagon. You gotta be loyal through the ups and downs, through the thick and thin if you\u2019re a true fan. That\u2019s what you call a true fan. If you\u2019re a fan that just likes the colors or like whatever you like, you may get discouraged. Twenty-five years is a long time, but like I said, if you\u2019re a true fan, a true fan is going to be loyal to whatever you believe in.\u201d\n\nNorman and Swearinger aren\u2019t the first Redskins players to comment on the home crowds this season. After Washington\u2019s loss to the Colts in the home opener, running back Chris Thompson said he wasn\u2019t a fan of the boos he heard from the crowd.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things you have to sit down and see what [Norman is] really saying,\u201d Thompson said Monday. \u201cIf you can understand what he\u2019s saying, he\u2019s not, again, just like me, not bashing the fans. We want everybody to come out and support us. That\u2019s what it comes down to. At the end of the day, we want our stands to be full of us. At the end of the day, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. I get as fans it\u2019s frustrating.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet on Sunday night, Norman challenged Redskins fans to make FedEx Field a place that opposing teams fear by being \u201cterrifyingly loud\u201d and \u201cmenacing.\u201d\n\n6-3 1st NFC-EasT, 1st time in along time that in itself should be \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd We worked on our craft to get here. Now it's you guy's turn.FedexField, is a place where visitors should 'Fear' Not b/c of Us. But b/c of how Terrifyingly Loud!&Menacing! YOU guys the FANS are. Come on #HTTR\ud83c\udff9 \u2014 *Joshua R. Norman (@J_No24) November 12, 2018\n\n\u201cAll the responses I see all the time is, \u2018We\u2019ve been fans for 10-plus years, we\u2019ve been fans for 25 years, whatever the case may be, and we haven\u2019t gotten any results,\u2019\u201d Thompson continued. \"'The Redskins have been terrible.' I\u2019ve been here for six years. I understand. I know. I\u2019ve been to one playoff game in six years. But, my thing is, I feel like we\u2019re doing good right now. We have a really good team. What it comes down to is, myself and Josh, we want it to be packed out and we don\u2019t\u2019 want it to feel like it\u2019s 50-50 when we\u2019re at our home field and they have as many fans as we do. I know that\u2019s exaggerating because that\u2019s never the case, but sometimes certain situations we\u2019re down and we\u2019re losing and their fans are super loud and we can\u2019t quiet them. That\u2019s obviously based of us having a poor performance. We just want everybody to be there. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s it.\n\n\u201cWe want our fans to be out there and just have our backs. It\u2019s really like, we don\u2019t know year-in and year-out, if we\u2019re going to get to a Super Bowl. But all 63 people in here want to win a Super Bowl. And that\u2019s our ultimate goal. We just want everybody to come out and support us through this journey. If you\u2019re a real fan, you\u2019re going to support your team through this journey not only if we come out and this season we\u2019re 9-1 or 8-1 or whatever. We\u2019ve dropped the ball and got killed in the three games we lost. It hasn\u2019t even been close. But we still want your support. I don\u2019t think any of the Super Bowl teams were undefeated, but they still got the support. That\u2019s all we want. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nKareem Copeland contributed to this report.\n\nRead more on the Redskins:\n\nRedskins-Buccaneers takeaways: Tampa Bay dominates the stat sheet, including turnovers committed\n\nRedskins earn ugly 16-3 win over the Buccaneers, remain in first place\n\nJosh Norman slams Redskins fans after road win: \u2018They just boo everything\u2019\n\nRedskins' win over Bucs didn\u2019t look pretty, but it passes the smell test\n\nRedskins have a much-needed (mostly) injury-free Sunday\n\nYears after almost coming to blows, Ryan Anderson and Jameis Winston exchanged jerseys\n\nHail or Fail: Redskins' incredible streak without a lead change is now nine games", "FILE - IN this Nov. 6, 2018, photo, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, listens during a news conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, at the presidential palace, in Kabul, Afghanistan. Ghani is denying the Taliban is winning the war in Afghanistan despite a continuing wave of deadly militant attacks and signs the militants are expanding areas under their control. Ghani said the Afghan state is not at risk of collapse and reiterated his government\u2019s intent to seek a negotiated peace. Ghani was speaking by video to an audience in Washington. (Massoud Hossaini/Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The president of Afghanistan told a U.S. audience Monday that his country is not losing the war to the Taliban and is not at risk of collapse amid escalating attacks by the militant group and an expansion of the territory it controls.\n\nPresident Ashraf Ghani said his administration is intent on seeking a negotiated peace with the Taliban, which have shown no interest in direct talks with a government they see as illegitimate.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban are not in a winning position,\u201d Ghani said by video to an audience at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University in Washington as a suicide bombing in Kabul and a deadly militant assault on districts in eastern Afghanistan suggested government control was slipping further.\n\nGhani said that more than 28,000 Afghan forces have been killed in the past four years but that the military will be able to retake territory as long as it has an air force and commando troops. He said most of the losses incurred by its security forces were in defending static positions, so the government was rethinking how it deploys its forces.\n\nSpeaking on Veterans Day, the Afghan leader paid tribute to American sacrifices in Afghanistan, including the death of Brent Taylor, a Utah mayor serving as a major in the state\u2019s Army National Guard who was training Afghan commandos. Taylor, 39, was fatally shot a week ago by one of his Afghan trainees.\n\nBut Ghani also offered a rare public accounting of the scale of the Afghan losses. He described how their casualties have risen sharply while U.S.-led coalition casualties have declined after Afghan forces assumed responsibility for combat operations in the country. He said that since 2015, 58 American forces have died in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cIn the same period, 28,529 of our security forces have lost their lives and become martyrs,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. military officials have previously indicated that Afghan casualties have been increasing, but they have avoided giving hard figures, apparently because of political sensitivities.\n\nIn its most recent report to Congress, in October, the special inspector general for Afghanistan said Afghan casualty numbers had been reported only in classified form since September 2017 because the U.S. military command in Kabul said it had stopped making them public at the request of the Afghan government. However, the report said that the average number of casualties between May and October this year was the greatest it has ever been during similar periods.\n\nOn Oct. 30, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Afghan forces had more than 1,000 dead and wounded during August and September alone, \u201cand they stayed in the field fighting.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has marginally increased U.S. troop numbers to train Afghan forces and intensify military pressure on the Taliban in hopes of forcing the insurgents to negotiate an end to the 17-year conflict. Successes on the battlefield have been elusive. The inspector general report said the number of districts under Afghan government control and influence has declined and stands at just 55 percent \u2014 down 16 percentage points in the past three years.\n\nU.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad is on his second tour of the region in a month, seeking to kick-start a peace process. The diplomatic veteran is making stops in Pakistan, Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, where the Taliban maintain a political office. The insurgents say they met Khalilzad in Qatar last month. The Taliban have so far refused direct negotiations with Kabul, which they view as a U.S. puppet.\n\nOn the sensitive topic of the U.S. role in talks, Ghani said there was \u201ctotal agreement\u201d between the U.S. and Afghan governments on moving the peace process forward.\n\n\u201cU.S. engagement is to ensure that talks with the Taliban result not in negotiations with Taliban but with talks, direct talks, between the Afghan government and the Taliban,\u201d he said.\n\nHe insisted that the Afghan government was seeking a negotiated peace but would not do so \u201cfrom a position of weakness.\u201d\n\nIn a possible sign of America\u2019s efforts, Pakistan released two Taliban officials on Monday, members of the militant group said. Abdul Samad Sani, a U.S.-designated terrorist who served as the Afghan Central Bank governor during the militants\u2019 rule in the late 1990s, and a lower-ranking commander named Salahuddin, were freed, according to two Taliban officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media.\n\nGhani, however, said Pakistan has yet to demonstrate a \u201csense of urgency\u201d in seeking an end to the Afghan conflict and a change in its policies.\n\nKabul has long protested that Afghan Taliban leaders and fighters enjoy sanctuary inside Pakistan, which Islamabad denies.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Robert Burns contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(DigitalGlobe/CSIS) (NA)\n\nOn Monday, a new report from a Washington think tank identified more than a dozen hidden bases in North Korea that could be used to disperse mobile launchers for ballistic missiles in the event of a conflict.\n\nAre these bases evidence that North Korea is cheating on the agreement it reached in June, when President Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore? Analysts say the answer is no \u2014 although there are plenty of caveats.\n\n\u201cKim hasn\u2019t broken any promises,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, a nonproliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterrey. \"Instead, he\u2019s making good on one of them \u2014 to mass produce nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nJoseph Bermudez, Victor Cha and Lisa Collins of the Center for Strategic and International Studies used satellite imagery and interviews with North Korean defectors and government officials to identify 13 missile bases. They say there are seven more bases that remain hidden.\n\nThe bases, which are located in \u201cmountainous terrain, often spread out within narrow dead-end valleys,\u201d they write, could be used to deploy mobile missile launchers, which would be extremely difficult for other nations to track and stop before the missiles could be fired.\n\nThe analysts looked specifically at the Sakkanmol Missile Operating Base, located only 84 miles from Seoul. \u201cAs of November 2018, the base is active and being reasonably well-maintained by North Korean standards,\u201d the report noted.\n\nNorth Korea dramatically improved its missile technology with provocative test launches last year. Western experts eventually concluded that Pyongyang now has the ability to hit most of the United States, although it remains unclear if it could produce a nuclear weapon small enough to fit atop a missile.\n\nAfter a tense 2017, diplomacy produced a thaw at the start of this year. North Korea announced it would put a halt to its weapons testing and dismantled a nuclear test site and a satellite launch facility thought to play a role in the country\u2019s ballistic missile program. When Kim met with Trump in Singapore over the summer, the two leaders agreed to build a \u201clasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula\u201d and to \u201cwork toward complete denuclearization\u201d of the peninsula.\n\nThe day after the summit, Trump wrote on Twitter that there was \u201cno longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.\u201d In public, he has largely kept this positive view of negotiations. \u201cWe\u2019re in no rush,\u201d he told reporters Wednesday, when asked about the prospect of a second summit with Kim, adding that the rockets and missiles \u201chave stopped.\u201d\n\nThe report is the latest evidence that while North Korea has indeed stopped its missile testing, it is far from dismantling its weapons facilities. Indeed, it appears to be adding to its stockpile: U.S. intelligence reports from the summer found that North Korea had begun producing new missiles at a factory, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged during Senate testimony that Pyongyang \u201ccontinues to produce fissile material.\u201d\n\nDuyeon Kim, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said while these developments violate U.N. Security Council resolutions, they do not breach Kim\u2019s agreement with Trump. \u201cNorth Korea didn\u2019t break any promises with Trump because there\u2019s no nuclear deal in place yet with Washington,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI realize I am a broken record, but North Korea has never offered to abandon its nuclear weapons,\u201d said Lewis, the nonproliferation expert. \u201cWhat North Korea has offered is the beginning of a process that might \u2014 might \u2014 someday lead to an outcome like that.\u201d\n\nThe State Department did not say whether they viewed the base as a violation of any agreements with the United States. \u201cPresident Trump has made clear that should Chairman Kim follow through on his commitments \u2014 including complete denuclearization and the elimination of ballistic missile programs \u2014 a much brighter future lies ahead for North Korea and its people,\" a spokesman said in a statement.\n\nThere have been several recent signs that diplomatic efforts between the United States and North Korea were stalling. A meeting scheduled for last week between Pompeo and Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear negotiator, Kim Yong Chol, was postponed unexpectedly, only days after North Korean state media released a commentary that suggested missile testing could resume if progress was not made on talks.\n\nAnalysts have long believed that North Korea had undeclared or hidden facilities in their missile program, which has made issues related to verification and inspections a major part of working level talks between the U.S. and North Korea. Pyongyang may have wanted the missile sites to be seen, suggested David Maxwell, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, to keep the pressure on in negotiations.\n\nKim Sung-han, the dean of Korea University\u2019s Graduate School of International Studies and a former South Korean vice foreign minister, said that the CSIS report showed the need for a \u201cverifiable declaration\" of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile capabilities as the next step in negotiations.\n\nHowever, he added, the report could also make the current stalemate between Washington and Pyongyang last \u201clonger than expected.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump\u2019s North Korea diplomacy quietly stalls\n\nU.S. spy agencies: North Korea is working on new missiles\n\nWhat made North Korea\u2019s weapons programs so much scarier in 2017", "Top Democrats from the House and Senate are demanding to know whether the Justice Department\u2019s ethics chief advised acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker to recuse himself from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s probe of the Trump campaign\u2019s Russia ties, citing \u201cserious ethical considerations\u201d that they say should keep him from overseeing the investigation.\n\nIn their letter, seven leading Democrats ask ethics chief Lee Lofthus to tell them \u201cimmediately\u201d whether he or others advised Whitaker to recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller probe or provided other ethical guidance related to his new job leading the Justice Department. The letter argues that Whitaker\u2019s stated views about Mueller and past connections to the Trump campaign \u201cindicate a clear bias against the investigation that would cause a reasonable person to question his impartiality.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E.

Schiff (D-Calif.); and the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), have all been critical of Whitaker\u2019s appointment to serve as acting attorney general since it was announced last week. In their letter to Lofthus, they repeated a number of the complaints about Whitaker that they have already aired, including his disparaging the evidence in the Mueller probe as \u201cweak\u201d and his concurrence with President Trump that the probe is \u201ca mere witch hunt.\u201d\n\nThey also pointed to Whitaker\u2019s public statements that Mueller\u2019s probe should be limited or defunded, as well as his affiliation with Sam Clovis, who was the Trump campaign\u2019s national co-chairman, as evidence that he is too biased against Mueller\u2019s investigation to oversee it.\n\n\u201cThe official supervising the Special Counsel investigation must be \u2014 in both fact and appearance \u2014 independent and impartial,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAllowing a vocal opponent of the investigation to oversee it will severely undermine public confidence in the Justice Department\u2019s work on this critically important matter.\u201d\n\nWhitaker has not indicated that he has any plans to recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller probe. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Democrats\u2019 letter.\n\nHouse Democrats have pledged to investigate Whitaker\u2019s actions as acting attorney general, particularly pertaining to the Mueller probe, as soon as they assume the House majority in January.\n\nNadler said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that Whitaker would be the first witness he calls before the House Judiciary committee.\n\nAnd Schiff has pledged to investigate not just Whitaker but any issues he may try to prevent Mueller from addressing in the course of his probe.\n\n\u201cThe House can both do its own investigation of the underlying issues and also investigate whether the president obstructed justice through the appointment and actions of Whitaker, or if the acting AG acted inappropriately on his own,\u201d Schiff said in an interview late last week.

Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.) dismissed criticism from President Trump blaming the fires on poor fire management in California and threatening to cut off federal dollars unless the supposed problems are remedied.\n\n\u201cYou have firefighters risking their life,\u201d Leahy told reporters on a conference call. \u201cFor them to see a tweet saying the U.S. Government won\u2019t support you, come on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you can\u2019t do complex government by tweet,\u201d Leahy said, adding that if Trump were asked to explain exactly what was amiss with fire management in California, \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d have absolutely no idea.\u201d\n\n[Death toll rises to 25 as 200,000 flee the most destructive fires in California\u2019s history]\n\nTrump said Saturday on Twitter: \u201cThere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\u201d\n\nThe push for funding to help California fight fires will come as Congress reconvenes this week for a post-election lame-duck session. First on the agenda is completing must-pass spending bills to keep the government operating ahead of a Dec. 7 deadline when money for a handful of agencies \u2014 including the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 will run out absent action from Congress and Trump. The wildfire money would probably be attached to the spending legislation.\n\nLeahy said there will need to be additional disaster relief money for ongoing hurricane recovery in Texas, Florida and elsewhere, including Puerto Rico, where Trump has also criticized the government response. The administration has not made an official disaster funding request to Congress, but Leahy said Democrats would push for congressional action anyway.\n\n[The weather and climate behind the California infernos that wrecked Paradise and torched Malibu]\n\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s going to have to be money for a number of natural disasters that occurred throughout the country; it\u2019s not just the fires in California,\u201d Leahy said. \u201cAnd what I would not agree to is have one face off against another.

Days earlier, the magazine reported that King had made an inflammatory joke about immigrants.\n\nThe Weekly Standard released the recording \u2014 a two-minute audio in which King can be heard bantering with a handful of supporters at the back of an Iowa restaurant during a campaign stop on Nov. 5, the magazine reported. He talked about pheasant hunting and his \u201cpatented pheasant noodle soup\u201d sprinkled with whole jalape\u00f1o peppers he had grown himself. Around the 1:20 mark, King joked that he\u2019d have to get some \u201cdirt from Mexico\u201d to grow his next batch of peppers because they didn\u2019t have enough bite.\n\n\u201cTrust me, it\u2019s already on its way,\u201d a woman quipped, appearing to refer to the caravan of Central American migrants traveling from Mexico to the U.S. border.\n\nKing engaged, saying: \u201cWell, yeah, there\u2019s plenty of dirt. It\u2019s coming from the West Coast, too. And a lot of other places, besides. This is the most dirt we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nThe following day, on Election Day, Weekly Standard assistant opinion editor Adam Rubenstein, who was covering the campaign event and has been critical of King, published an article about the conversation. It included a transcript but not the audio.\n\nIn a statement to The Washington Post on Monday evening, Sarah Stevens, King\u2019s chief of staff, accused the Weekly Standard of misrepresenting the congressman\u2019s comments and conjuring a false story. Stevens said the congressman believed the supporter was referring to dirt coming from the \u201cleftist media,\u201d not immigrants. In response to the supporter, King repeated similar comments he had been making during the campaign \u2014 that the \u201cleftist media\u201d and liberal multibillionaires from coastal states were trying to smear him, Stevens said.\n\nThe magazine stood by its story, saying it quoted King at length to provide readers with context. Claiming King was referring to the media is \u201cabsurd\u201d given the context of the conversation, during which the media was never mentioned, according to an editor\u2019s note at the end of Rubenstein\u2019s story.\n\n[Following the Pittsburgh attack, Rep.

He suggested that the magazine refused to publish the audio because it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nHours later, on Saturday, the Weekly Standard did release it, along with a column from Hayes.\n\n\u201cSo, King claimed our reporter lied. He didn\u2019t. He claimed we didn\u2019t have a recording. We did. He insisted we refused to release the audio.

Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) on Capitol Hill on June 27. (Alex Brandon/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nAppearing on the Sunday shows, the Democrats in line to chair important committees \u2014 Reps. Jerrold Nadler of New York (Judiciary), Adam B. Schiff of California (Intelligence), Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland (Government Oversight) \u2014 and the likely speaker, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), made every effort to walk the political tightrope. Investigating the administration too ferociously and randomly, Republicans will scream witch hunt and moderates just elected from the suburbs will catch flak; do too little and the Democratic base will go ballistic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be handing out subpoenas like somebody\u2019s handing out candy on Halloween,\u201d Cummings said on ABC. \u201cI take this as a lawyer and as an officer of the court, I take subpoenas very seriously. And I plan to, if I have to use them, they will be used in a very \u2014 in a methodical way and it must be in the public interest.\u201d He continued with this exchange:\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So you\u2019re saying you can investigate and work on policy at the same time. What are your top oversight priorities? CUMMINGS: George, I really want to look at some things that affect people on a day to day basis such as, as I said drug prices and health care issues. But I also want to look at things like the census. We are having some problems right now with regard to the Trump administration wanting to put in a citizenship question, which we know will discourage people from participating in the census. Very important. That\u2019s right around the corner. Again, we\u2019ve got to look at things like voter \u2014 voter suppression. We cannot have a country where we do \u2014 where we have \u2014 it becomes normal to do everything in folk\u2019s power to stop people from voting. There\u2019s no reason why in the United States of America people should be standing in line for four and five hours and \u2014 and basically being pushed away from the polls. We\u2019ve got to turn that around.\n\nIn a similar vein, Nadler said, \u201cRight now our top priority is to protect the Mueller investigation, to protect the integrity of that investigation from the White House attempt to stifle it and to \u2014 to interfere with it.\u201d As for Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, it\u2019s not a question of impeaching him, Nadler said. \u201cI think we have to look at, not with a view toward doing anything about Justice Kavanaugh there \u2014 he\u2019s there, unfortunately \u2014 but with a view toward making sure that the integrity of the process for the future is restored.\u201d\n\nThere are a few takeaways here. Democrats would be well-advised to remember what their goal is: Protecting democratic norms and institutions in the remainder of the Trump presidency, and showing the country they can govern effectively as a co-equal branch of government.\n\nFirst, oversight and legislation are intertwined. If you don\u2019t know how the FBI handled the Kavanaugh investigation, it\u2019s hard to know what to fix. If we still don\u2019t know how Jared Kushner got a top-secret clearance or how Rob Porter, former White House staff secretary, stayed on so long with credible allegation of spousal abuse, you don\u2019t know whether legislation is needed or whether the White House is simply incompetent (or both).\n\nSecond, when examining the list of possible investigations, committee chairs should consider whether a topic meets one or all of the following criteria. It: affects the democratic process (e.g., voter suppression, the census); implicates a specific constitutional issue (e.g., emoluments, using the power of the government to violate First Amendment rights); uncovers corruption, which the Democrats vowed to root out (e.g., Do Trump or Kushner have conflicts of interest regarding Saudi Arabia? Which Cabinet officials have abused travel policies?); and reveals serious policy wrongdoing or incompetence (e.g., the child separation policy, getting the translators\u2019 notes to reveal what Trump told Russian President Vladimir Putin, and efforts to sabotage Obamacare and/or lack of effort to curtail drug prices). If something doesn\u2019t fit into one or more of these categories, Democrats shouldn\u2019t make a huge to-do of it. Committees should when possible, explore one topic at a time in public hearings while working behind the scenes to gather information to pursue future investigations.\n\nThird, part of oversight is figuring out what the heck the administration is doing. What happened to sanctioning Saudi Arabia? If North Korea is engaged in familiar delay tactics, was the Trump-Kim Jong Un summit a bust \u2014 and if so, what do we do now? What\u2019s in NAFTA 2.0, and is it \u2014 the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement \u2014 better or worse than the original North American Free Trade Agreement?\n\nFinally, Congress needs to clean up its own act. Here are just three areas where they should focus: The House and Senate must reach agreement on new rules regarding sexual harassment; the House should pass new rules on stock ownership prohibiting members from trading or owning stocks in industries they regulate (e.g., no oil stocks if you sit on the Energy and Commerce Committee); and a new rule to force a vote of expulsion if a member is indicted. If the House acts, perhaps Republicans in the Senate will be shamed into going along.\n\nIn short, Democrats need to prioritize investigations, think how legislation and oversight work, reveal the administration\u2019s gross mismanagement and clean up their own body. It would be helpful if Pelosi gave a major address laying this out so voters understand what Congress is doing and why. Oh, and along the way, Democrats surely should point out that lack of oversight by Republicans for two years has allowed corruption and malfeasance to flourish. Real oversight cannot come too soon.\n\nRead more from Jennifer Rubin:\n\nWe\u2019re in deep trouble when \u2018SNL\u2019 is our guide to mature behavior\n\nA powerful reminder of the dangers of Trumpian nationalism\n\nTwo GOP senators: Flake defends democracy, Rubio undermines it\n\nThe real \u2018real America\u2019\n\nNow it\u2019s their turn: Blue-state Republicans on the hot seat", "\n\nA split-season view of the Tidal Basin during 2018. The winter slice was shot Jan. 17, spring was shot April 13, summer was shot Aug. 14, and fall was shot Nov 8. (Kevin Ambrose)\n\nThis past year, I photographed the Tidal Basin in all four seasons. As with past years, I chose a single location to shoot the same scene in winter, spring, summer and fall. I also shot various seasonal views from different locations around the basin.\n\nSpring and summer are the most popular seasons for people to visit the Tidal Basin, and there is always plenty of activity to photograph. During the fall and winter, especially on the cold and stormy days, the Tidal Basin is crowd-free, with only die-hard joggers braving the weather as they run the Tidal Basin Loop Trail.\n\nDuring a few of my winter photo shoots, I felt like I was the only person there. No-one was around. In contrast, during my spring cherry blossom shoots, there were times the crowd was so thick it was even hard to walk. The spring blossom scenes are the most challenging to photograph because people frequently block the views.\n\nFor this post, I created a split-season image and a four-panel image showing winter, spring, summer and fall, all photographed from the same location. I have also included five photos from each season with a brief summary of the season.\n\n\n\nThese are the photos that went into the 2018 split-season view.

Nobel!,\u201d taking even President Trump by surprise (though he later claimed that \u201ceveryone thinks\u201d he deserved one). Not long after, Trump met with Kim Jong Un and returned to declare that he had achieved what presidents had tried and failed to do for decades:\n\nJust landed - a long trip, but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office. There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea. Meeting with Kim Jong Un was an interesting and very positive experience. North Korea has great potential for the future! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 13, 2018\n\nWell, about that \u2026\n\nNorth Korea is moving ahead with its ballistic missile program at 16 hidden bases that have been identified in new commercial satellite images, a network long known to American intelligence agencies but left undiscussed as President Trump claims to have neutralized the North\u2019s nuclear threat. The satellite images suggest that the North has been engaged in a great deception: It has offered to dismantle a major launching site \u2014 a step it began, then halted \u2014 while continuing to make improvements at more than a dozen others that would bolster launches of conventional and nuclear warheads. The existence of the ballistic missile bases, which North Korea has never acknowledged, contradicts Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that his landmark diplomacy is leading to the elimination of a nuclear and missile program that the North had warned could devastate the United States.\n\nWho could have predicted something like this would happen? Pretty much everyone. Except, apparently, the president of the United States. In fact, it\u2019s precisely Trump\u2019s naive view of foreign policy that brought us to this point.\n\nLet\u2019s recall what happened at that summit in June, when the two leaders signed an agreement under which the North Koreans promised to \u201cwork toward\u201d denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. That pledge was almost completely meaningless; as Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told me at the time, \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that that is a weaker commitment to denuclearization than the regime has made in the past.\u201d\n\nBut the president naturally declared victory. \u201cHe\u2019s de-nuking, I mean he\u2019s de-nuking the whole place,\u201d Trump said, an assertion that was obviously false. One can only hope Trump was lying and didn\u2019t actually believe that was what was happening.\n\nSo that summit, which seemed so dramatic at the time, turned out to be a failure. Why? Because Trump is gripped by a fundamental misconception about foreign policy.\n\nFor Trump, everything is personal and everything is about him. He doesn\u2019t need to understand the history of our relationships with other nations, the forces acting on an an adversary or the incentives its leadership faces. He\u2019s the world\u2019s greatest dealmaker! He\u2019ll get in a room with the guy, employ the same skills he uses to drive down the price on gold-leaf wallpaper for one of his buildings and, bada boom bada bing, we\u2019ve got ourselves a historic bilateral agreement.\n\nYou can see it in the way Trump talks about foreign relations. He never tries to understand where other countries are coming from or what they are seeking; it\u2019s all about whether they\u2019re screwing us over and whether he\u2019ll \u201cget along\u201d with another country\u2019s leader, as though a friendly personal relationship will make anything possible. \u201cI hope we get along well. I think we get along well,\u201d he said about Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cWe had a great chemistry, not good, but great,\u201d he said about Chinese President Xi Jinping. \u201cI liked him and he liked me a lot.\u201d A few weeks ago he described his relationship with Kim this way: \u201cI was really being tough, and so was he, and we\u2019d go back and forth. And then we fell in love. Okay? No, really. He wrote me beautiful letters, and they\u2019re great letters. We fell in love.\u201d\n\nBut alas, love can be fleeting. The problem is that no matter how many beautiful letters Kim sends to Trump, the North Korean leader still sees nuclear weapons as the key to his survival. As far as he\u2019s concerned, his weapons mean that no great power would dare to invade his country and destroy his regime; without them, he could wind up like Saddam Hussein or Moammar Gaddafi, i.e., deposed and dead.\n\nIt\u2019s vital to understand that while Kim is a brutal dictator, that\u2019s an absolutely rational position for him to take. Which means that getting him to give up those nuclear weapons is difficult and complicated. In fact, it\u2019s possible that there\u2019s nothing we can offer him in exchange that would be sufficiently enticing.\n\nTrump is hardly the first U.S. president to struggle with North Korea\u2019s willingness to deceive and break its promises, nor is he the first who failed to find something compelling enough to offer North Korea in exchange for denuclearization. But no president before him was so naive as to proclaim victory after having accomplished so little. I suppose that makes Trump\u2019s foreign policy just the same as everything else he does.", "\n\nThe Canadian model shows a wintry mix of precipitation over the Washington region midday Thursday. (PivotalWeather.com)\n\nIt\u2019s only mid-November, but the Washington region will have its first opportunity to see snowflakes between Thursday morning and midday. Any snow that falls is unlikely to stick but would be an unusual event, as snow has been scarce in November in recent years.\n\nA storm system will be developing to our south Thursday and on the move toward our region. High pressure positioned to our north may initially feed in enough cold air for a period of snow and/or sleet before precipitation changes to a cold, drenching rain.\n\nThe exact track of the storm will determine whether snow or sleet materializes when precipitation arrives. If the storm tracks more to our east, it would allow enough cold air to stay in place to support snow or sleet. But a track to the west would pull in enough warm air for plain rain.\n\nCapital Weather Gang winter weather expert Wes Junker called the setup \u201cinteresting\u201d and noted that both the American and European models \u201csuggest the potential for wintry weather at the onset of precipitation\u201d between predawn and midday Thursday (the storm\u2019s exact timing is still to be determined).\n\nAny wintry precipitation would probably last only an hour or two close to Washington, with any accumulation mainly on grassy areas.

Both were found guilty Monday of being members of National Action, the extreme right-wing organization that virtually deifies Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. Thomas was also found guilty of possessing instructions to make a bomb.\n\nThomas, a British warehouse security guard, and Patatas, a Portuguese-born photographer, were arrested in January with four other men and charged with being members of National Action, which was banned by the British government in 2016 and is labeled a terrorist organization.\n\nThe group hoped to start a race war that would rid Britain \u2014 or at least the county of West Midlands, halfway between London and Liverpool \u2014 of anyone who didn\u2019t happen to be white, according to police. When National Action was banned, after popular anti-Brexit campaigner Jo Cox was killed by a far-right extremist, the group re-branded, calling itself the TripleKMafia, a not-too-subtle allusion to the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nBut authorities said the group\u2019s members weren\u2019t simply a bunch of photo-snapping Nazi-philes with white-power insignia decorating their homes.\n\n\u201cWe now know they were a dangerous, well-structured organization,\u201d Midland Police Detective Chief Superintendent Matt Ward said in the police statement. \u201cTheir aim was to spread neo-Nazi ideology by provoking a race war in the UK and they had spent years acquiring the skills to carry this out.\n\n\u201cThey had researched how to make explosives. They had gathered weapons. They had a clear structure to radicalize others. Unchecked they would have inspired violence and spread hatred and fear across the West Midlands.\u201d\n\nUnderscoring the threat, police announced the conviction of two other members of National Action: Mikko Vehvilainen and Alex Deakin.\n\nVehvilainen, 34, a Finland native, was a lance corporal in the British army who Ward said had \u201caccess to young men who could be radicalized and recruited into the group. He was an incredibly dangerous individual and a key part of the National Action strategy.\u201d\n\nThomas had tried twice to join the military but was rejected both times.\n\nPatatas and Thomas had also tried to swell the ranks of National Action, putting up offensive stickers at Aston University in Birmingham.\n\nNational Action was the first extreme right-wing group to be banned in Britain after Cox was killed in summer 2016. During the trial, according to The Washington Post\u2019s Karla Adam, witnesses told jurors that white supremacist Thomas Mair shouted \u201cBritain first!\u201d then shot Cox three times and stabbed her 15 times.\n\nAuthorities said Mair was an avid reader of far-right literature. In his home, police found books about white supremacy and Nazi Germany. Cox\u2019s husband called her death a \u201cpolitical act and an act of terrorism.\u201d Mair was sentenced to life in prison, and authorities added National Action to a list of more than 80 terrorist organizations banned in the United Kingdom.\n\nAccording to the BBC, the ban was to \u201cboth tackle the group itself and also eliminate a source of ideological inspiration.\u201d\n\nBut the ban didn\u2019t stop Patatas, Thomas and other adherents in Midlands. The couple\u2019s continuing fascination with Nazism, white supremacy and racial war was on display at their trial.\n\nThe BBC said the couple was part of a \u201csecret relaunch\u201d of the group \u2014 a different name, TripleKMafia, but the same agenda.\n\nThe couple kept an ax and a machete at home, and authorities found a crossbow near the newborn\u2019s crib, the news organization said.\n\nBut they also had several items best described as Nazi memorabilia: a mug with an SS emblem and a cookie cutter shaped like a swastika.\n\nTwo couch cushions also bore swastikas, and a festive holiday sideboard in their living room had KKK figures and the words \u201cMay all your Christmases be white.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nEven a video game\u2019s \u2018Make America Nazi-free Again\u2019 slogan ticked some people off\n\nFor weeks he trained a dog to do a Nazi salute.

While other officials implicated in the plot have fled the country, the former intelligence chief is now residing in northern Ethiopia and should turn himself in to authorities, he said.\n\nYilikal Getnet, an opposition figure, told The Associated Press the public had demanded the arrests of the former officials.\n\n\u201cThese have been issues that we in the opposition have long been calling for, too,\u201d he said, adding that Ethiopia needs a truth and reconciliation process to investigate past misdoings. \u201cThe ruling party alone can\u2019t bring justice for all these atrocities committed in the past.\u201d\n\nUnder the previous government, Ethiopia, a close security ally of the West, used to be accused of rights violations by human rights activists. Since Abiy, 42, came to power in April his new government has released several thousand political prisoners, permitted exiled opposition groups to return home, dropped terror charges against prominent opposition politicians and permitted the media to operate more freely.\n\nDespite the reforms, ethnic-based clashes are continuing in some parts of Ethiopia and pose the most serious threat to Abiy\u2019s leadership of this East African nation of 100 million people.\n\nAmnesty International welcomed the arrests.\n\n\u201cThese arrests are an important first step toward ensuring full accountability for the abuses that have dogged the country for several decades,\u201d said Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International\u2019s East Africa Director. \u201cMany of these officials were at the helm of government agencies infamous for perpetrating gross human rights violations, such as torture and the arbitrary detention of people including in secret facilities.

It is time that these very rich countries either pay the United States for its great military protection, or protect themselves...and Trade must be made FREE and FAIR! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2018\n\nThe United States does not foot the bill for any European country\u2019s security forces.\n\nTrump seems to be referencing an old talking point about the United States paying more than its fair share toward NATO. But his framing is misleading. Countries don\u2019t pay into some kind of specific NATO fund. Rather, each member nation agrees to dedicate a certain portion of its gross domestic product toward its own armed forces. In the past, Trump has objected to several NATO countries not spending at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense.\n\nCurrently, six countries (out of the 29 NATO members) hit that target: Greece, Estonia, Poland, Latvia, Britain and the United States.\n\nBut NATO made the 2 percent requirement mandatory only in 2014, and it gave member states until 2024 to hit that goal.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s comments misrepresent the way NATO functions,\u201d former U.S. ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder told us last year, after the president made similar remarks. \u201cThe president keeps saying that we need to be paid by the Europeans for the fact that we have troops in Europe or provide defense there. But that\u2019s not how it works.\u201d\n\nIn a report on this issue, the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote that \u201cthe Trump Administration\u2019s focus on military burden sharing as the percent of a nation\u2019s economy or GDP devoted to defense is a dangerously meaningless criteria for judging useful defense efforts.\u201d\n\nTrump also exaggerated the trade deficit between the United States and Europe. In 2017, the E.U. had a $101 billion trade surplus with the United States. As the New York Times explained, the president often fails to include trade in services such as law, finance and technology when calculating that number.\n\nHe does so even though his own advisers have highlighted the importance of trade in services. The U.S. economy has shifted \u201cfrom manufacturing and toward service provision industries\u201d in recent decades, according to a report by the Trump White House in March. \u201cFocusing only on the trade in goods alone ignores the United States\u2019 comparative advantage in services.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, most economists don\u2019t see a deficit as a \u201closs\u201d for the United States. As the New York Times put it:\n\n\u201cMost economists do not see the trade gap as money \u2018lost\u2019 to other countries, nor do they worry about trade deficits to a large degree. That\u2019s because trade imbalances are affected by a host of macroeconomic factors, including the relative growth rates of countries, the value of their currencies, and their saving and investment rates.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nNo, Germany doesn\u2019t owe America \u2018vast sums\u2019 of money for NATO\n\nWhat America could do with European levels of military spending", "Opinion writer\n\n\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d comedian Pete Davidson got reamed for making a tasteless joke a week ago Saturday about Dan Crenshaw, a former Navy SEAL who lost his eye in combat in Afghanistan.

Our indignation should be reserved for hateful, violent actions and/or public figures who divide the country, fan racism and resentment, lie continually, act inhumanely and put partisan or personal advantage over country.\n\nThe mensch-like behavior of all concerned in the \u201cSNL\u201d debacle holds another lesson, as well. Trump critics who remain furious 24/7 with Trump\u2019s tweets and outbursts perhaps can take solace in a phenomenon that becomes more vivid as Trump\u2019s conduct deteriorates. Whether it\u2019s a self-absorbed and mean comment about California in the midst of a natural disaster of enormous proportions, or missing a World War I commemoration ceremony in France, Trump is making himself look more petty, clueless and irrelevant by the day.\n\nCalifornians will fight the fires; mature politicians will provide leadership and aid. European leaders displayed tremendous dignity at the Armistice Day remembrances. For two years, the United States \u2014 and the West more generally \u2014 will have to get by with an unfit U.S. president, one incapable of performing even the bare-minimum duties of the office. A true international crisis or economic disruption would test how well we can muddle along without a functional president.\n\nThe challenge today is in containing the danger Trump poses to our democratic norms and institutions, in keeping Western democracies safe and democratic and in finding other public figures to serve as role models for decent, kind behavior. I just never thought we\u2019d get more examples of admirable conduct from \u201cSNL\u201d than the White House.\n\nRelated:\n\nRead more from Jennifer Rubin:\n\nA powerful reminder of the dangers of Trumpian nationalism\n\nTwo GOP senators: Flake defends democracy, Rubio undermines it\n\nThe real \u2018real America\u2019\n\nNow it\u2019s their turn: Blue-state Republicans on the hot seat", "Now that Democrats will control the House, they have free rein to launch as many investigations into President Trump and his administration as they would like. They plan to hold back on any impeachment proceedings \u2014 despite nearly two-thirds of voters in battleground states who supported Democratic candidates wanting them to start \u2014 until they see what is uncovered in Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nBut they still have plenty of other ways to keep themselves busy.\n\nDemocrats understand that a significant message from voters last week was for them to provide a check on the Trump White House. Over the past week, incoming committee chairs have said they are planning to utilize their newfound power to this end but will do so strategically. Soon-to-be House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) said Sunday on ABC\u2019s This Week, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be handing out subpoenas like somebody\u2019s handing out candy on Halloween.\"\n\nCandy or not, there is a lot to chew on. Here is a list, and it is nowhere near exhaustive, of the areas the Democrats plan to investigate and hold hearings on when they take over in January.\n\nRussian interference\n\nYes, Democrats will wait for Mueller\u2019s report, but incoming House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) has said he would look at how the House\u2019s probe into potential meddling was incomplete and seek to fill in any remaining gaps. His predecessor, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), has been accused of trying harder to find a government conspiracy against Trump rather than wrongdoing by Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nIn an interview with the Fix, Schiff said that \u201cit\u2019s not my intention to sit by idly while we await Mueller.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may be that there is a report before we even take the gavel, and if that\u2019s the case we\u2019ll be guided by what their findings are. It\u2019s my hope they\u2019ll be shared with Congress and the American people. This is too big an issue to be swept under the rug, but if the Mueller report is not available, we intend to push forward with important investigative work. The reality for us is: Republicans walked away from the investigations. They decided to dedicate themselves to the president\u2019s defense, but we never walked away from it. That will be our intention, to finish this work, and we\u2019ll now have power to compel people to testify.\u201d\n\nOn a related topic, Schiff wrote in a Washington Post op-ed last month that his committee would address \u201callegations the Russians may possess financial leverage over the president, including perhaps the laundering of Russian money through his businesses.\u201d\n\nMatt Whitaker\n\nIf new acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker does not recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation because of his outspoken critiques of Mueller and the probe\u2019s merits, and if Whitaker is still in the position by the time the new Congress convenes, House Democrats are prepared to investigate his conflicts of interest.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the likely next chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that he plans to summon Whitaker to testify as his panel\u2019s first witness and is prepared to subpoena him if necessary. And Schiff, on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d said that if Whitaker does not recuse himself, his actions related to the investigation will be scrutinized for any interference.\n\n\u201cIf he has any involvement whatsoever in this Russia probe, we are going to find out whether he made commitments to the president about the probe, whether he is serving as a back channel to the president or his lawyers about the probe, whether he\u2019s doing anything to interfere with the probe. Mr. Whitaker needs to understand that he will be called to answer. And any role that he plays will be exposed to the public,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nHush money\n\nThe House Oversight Committee plans to investigate Trump\u2019s role in paying Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, who alleged they had affairs with him, to stay quiet before the 2016 election. Cummings sent a letter in September to the White House and the Trump Organization requesting documents related to the hush payments but never received them. Now that Democrats are in the majority, they have more leverage to demand that information.\n\nTax returns\n\nRep. Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), who will take over the gavel of the powerful tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said that if Trump does not voluntarily release his tax returns, Neal will file a legal request with the Treasury Department that they be released to a small group in Congress. Neal said last week he expects the issue to end up in federal court.\n\nHe also told our Post colleagues that \u201che could obtain the returns using a 1924 law that gives heads of the congressional tax-writing committees the right to request any American\u2019s tax returns. The panel could then make them public with a simple majority vote.\u201d\n\nEmoluments clause\n\nThere are already two lawsuits underway alleging Trump has violated the emoluments clause in the Constitution by accepting payments from foreign governments via dignitaries staying at the Trump hotel in Washington. One of the lawsuits was brought by Democratic members of Congress, and a judge in September ruled they had legal standing to do so. But as the lawsuits make their way through the courts, Cummings has said a potential violation of the Constitution for personal financial gain is one issue he plans to have his committee investigate.\n\nAnd Rep. John Garamendi (D-Calif.), a senior member of the transportation committee, which has jurisdiction over government properties (the hotel is in the former U.S. Post Office building), said the panel will investigate the Trump hotel, telling Bloomberg TV last week: \u201cWe have a constitutional responsibility. . . . Did the president receive money from a foreign government? Think Saudi Arabia. Think Kuwait.\u201d\n\nSecurity clearances\n\nDemocrats want to know how certain individuals, such as Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and former staff secretary Rob Porter, were working at the highest level of the White House without security clearances. They will also probe Trump\u2019s decision to revoke security clearances from John Brennan, the former Central Intelligence Agency director, and other Trump critics.\n\nMedia targeting\n\nSchiff thinks Democrats should probe whether Trump used his office to try to punish companies associated with CNN and The Washington Post.\n\nSchiff pointed to Trump\u2019s effort to block AT&T from purchasing Time Warner, the parent company of CNN, and his desire to get the U.S. Postal Service to increase shipping costs for Amazon, whose chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Post.\n\n\u201cThe president is not only castigating the press but might be secretly using instruments of state power to punish them,\u201d Schiff said in an interview with The Post on Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s a great threat to press freedom.\u201d\n\nBrett M. Kavanaugh\n\nWhile some Democratic voters would love to see the new House majority take up impeachment charges against Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, Nadler said Sunday that that is not the path he plans to take. Instead, he said he intends to use the power of his committee to investigate why the FBI did not do a more thorough job looking into the allegations of sexual misconduct made against Kavanaugh during his confirmation process.\n\nNadler said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d he would be examining \u201cthe process by which the FBI was stifled in its investigation by the White House.\u201d\n\nFamily separations\n\nThere remain many unanswered questions about the White House\u2019s \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d at the border that resulted in the separations of thousands of children from their parents. Many children remain separated, and Cummings\u2019s oversight panel intends to probe the lapses that occurred, both in how it is that children are still in government custody as well as reports that children were mistreated while in government care.\n\nHealth care\n\nDemocrats made health care, and specifically protections for people with preexisting conditions, a cornerstone of their midterm campaign platform. Now Nadler wants to launch an investigation into the Trump administration\u2019s decision not to defend the Affordable Care Act against a lawsuit that, if successful, would bring down the entire law.\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos\n\nThe Education and Workforce Committee under Democratic control are going to demand more answers from DeVos, who has largely avoided oversight of her work at the Education Department. Inside Higher Ed called her \u201cone of the biggest losers of the midterm elections,\u201d explaining:\n\nDemocrats will focus on decisions by DeVos on two major higher education rules. She\u2019s proposed a more restrictive overhaul of the borrower-defense rule, which allows defrauded students to seek loan forgiveness, and a repeal of the gainful-employment rule, which holds higher ed programs accountable for graduating students with debt they can\u2019t repay. https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/11/07/democratic-house-will-trigger-tougher-oversight-devos\n\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke\n\nOur Post colleagues reported last week that Rep.

Entertainment)\n\nThe deadly wildfires raging in California have hit particularly close to home in Hollywood, and the devastation was on a lot of minds at the People\u2019s Choice Awards on Sunday night.\n\nThe fires, which are burning in both Northern and Southern California, have claimed dozens of lives and forced thousands of residents to evacuate communities in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. Celebrities including Miley Cyrus, Gerard Butler and Neil Young have lost properties in the fires, which have also destroyed a number of prominent Hollywood sets.\n\n[California wildfires threaten Hollywood sets and celebrity homes]\n\nKim Kardashian West, who appeared alongside three of her sisters \u2014 Khloe, Kourtney and Kendall \u2014 and their mother, Kris Jenner, to accept the family\u2019s People\u2019s Choice Award for reality show of 2018, devoted most of her speech to the wildfires. She also referenced recent mass shootings, which include a deadly attack at a bar in Thousand Oaks, Calif.\n\nThe sisters live in areas affected by the wildfires and took to social media last week as they fled their homes. Kardashian West revealed last week on Instagram that she had evacuated the Hidden Hills home she owns with husband Kanye West. On Friday, she tweeted that flames had reached the property but that the fire appeared to be \u201cmore contained.\u201d She added, \u201cI just pray the winds are in our favor.\"\n\nHere is a transcript of Kardashian West\u2019s full speech:\n\nIt\u2019s been a really rough week in our home in Calabasas, Hidden Hills, and our neighbors in Thousand Oaks and Malibu. Our hearts are broken from the horrific shootings and those who have lost their lives and homes, as well as the hundreds of thousands of us that have been evacuated from the devastating fires that are currently burning. As horrible as this has been, it\u2019s been amazing to see the resilient spirit of everyone involved and the heroism of those risking their lives on the front lines. Action is necessary. So anything that we can do to help, as simple as donating to the many organizations that are collecting supplies \u2014 no form of help is too small. Our country is stronger when we come together, and we cannot face devastation alone. We must continue to reach out and help each other in these trying times. So thank you so much to all of the people that have voted for us. This is such an honor, and we would like to dedicate this win to all of the firefighters, the law enforcement and the first responders. Thank you.

Rick Scott, to recuse himself from overseeing the process, and as President Trump alleged without evidence that ballots were missing and forged.\n\nAs local officials scrambled to meet Thursday\u2019s machine-\n\nrecount deadline, lawsuits mounted from all sides \u2014 including a complaint by the League of Women Voters and Common Cause Florida seeking to bar Scott from using his position to influence the ballot-counting process.\n\nEarlier Monday, a state judge rejected a request from Scott to seize voting machines and ballots in closely watched Broward County, ruling there was no evidence of voter fraud.\n\nMeanwhile, Scott pressed forward with plans to travel to Washington this week for orientation activities designed for newly elected senators. \u201cI\u2019m headed to Washington tomorrow to start the process of becoming the next U.S. senator,\u201d Scott said Monday night in an appearance on Fox News.\n\nMachine recounts in Florida\u2019s races for governor, Senate and agriculture commissioner were ordered Saturday because of tight margins in the votes and immediately became the focus of lawsuits by candidates. A more-complicated hand recount could follow in the Senate and agriculture commissioner races, depending on the margins of victory.\n\nThe results in the country\u2019s largest swing state will have repercussions in Washington, where a win by Scott would help Republicans further consolidate their Senate majority.\n\nAs the recount continues, Scott is engaging frequently with national Republicans and pressing wealthy benefactors to donate to his effort. On Tuesday, National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Scott intend to hold a conference call with donors, according to two people familiar with their plans.\n\nMonday began with a combative tweet from Trump claiming that \u201can honest vote count is no longer possible\u201d and that ballots had been \u201cmassively infected.\u201d He argued that the results from the night of the Nov. 6 election should stand, handing victories to Scott, as well as Republican former congressman Ron DeSantis in the gubernatorial contest.\n\n\u201cThe Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged,\u201d the president said in a tweet that misstated what Florida officials have concluded.\n\nUnder state law, ballots from overseas and military voters have until Friday to arrive to be counted.\n\nWhite House officials did not respond to requests for comment about whether the president was referring to those ballots.\n\nOn the ground, both campaigns began mobilizing thousands of volunteers amid growing legal challenges.\n\nRebuffing Scott\u2019s campaign, state Judge Jack Tuter ruled against the governor\u2019s request to have local sheriffs seize ballots and machines in Broward County not in use in the recount. Tuter said that there was no evidence of voter fraud and that Brenda Snipes, the county election supervisor, needs to be allowed to do her job and finish the count.\n\nTuter also appeared to admonish the Scott team for suggesting voter fraud without offering evidence of it.\n\n\u201cEverything the lawyers are saying out there at the elections office is being beamed out across the country. We should be careful what we say,\u201d Tuter said. \u201cThese words mean things these days, as everybody in the room knows.\u201d\n\nTuter\u2019s ruling was on one of at least nine lawsuits that have been filed over the recounts. Scott also has sued to impound ballots and equipment in Palm Beach, although there has not yet been a hearing on that suit.\n\nNew lawsuits Monday include one filed on behalf of VoteVets, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee asking that all mail-in ballots postmarked by last Tuesday be counted. Under current rules, ballots must be received by 7 p.m. on Election Day.\n\nA separate suit by the League of Women Voters and the nonprofit watchdog group Common Cause Florida asks to bar Scott from using \u201cthe power of his office in any manner related to Florida\u2019s 2018 Senate race as long as he remains a candidate.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s \u201cmisuse of his official powers in favor of his own candidacy demonstrates the truth of the axiom that no man may be the judge in his own cause,\u201d the lawsuit stated.\n\nThe suit echoes Nelson\u2019s call earlier Monday for Scott to recuse himself from the recount. \u201cHe\u2019s thrown around words like \u2018voter fraud\u2019 without any proof,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nIn a Fox News television appearance earlier, Scott called Nelson a \u201csore loser\u201d and alleged that \u201che\u2019s just here to steal this election.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, a court will hear a request from Nelson to reexamine absentee and provisional ballots that were not counted because signatures did not match.\n\nScott\u2019s team is bracing for the likely prospect of a manual recount. They are planning to have at least one lawyer in each of the state\u2019s 67 counties if a manual recount is triggered.\n\nScott already has lined up more than 7,500 recount volunteers. Larger concentrations of volunteers will appear in more-populous counties and areas where Republicans have pointed to issues in vote counting, including Broward and Palm Beach, according to his campaign.\n\nDemocrats say they will muster similar cavalry.\n\n\u201cWe will easily match that number,\u201d said Charles Lichtman, one of the lawyers working on behalf of Nelson. \u201cI look forward to this being, you know, the \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 final scene\u201d \u2014 in which the Republicans lose, he added.\n\nLichtman said he is in charge of recruiting, training volunteers, positioning them in the right places, making sure they follow the law and \u201cmaking sure every vote gets counted.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the recount process was further roiled by the revelation that voters in Bay County, which was hit by Hurricane Michael, had been allowed to submit ballots by email, in apparent violation of state law.\n\nBay County Supervisor of Elections Mark Andersen said in an interview with local TV stations WJHG and WECP on Friday that he had allowed 147 voters to return their ballots by email. Anyone who wants to take away those votes \u201cought to be ashamed of yourselves because what we did is take care of voters,\u201d Andersen said in the interview.\n\nScott issued an executive order Oct. 18 giving election supervisors in eight counties that were hit hard by the hurricane the ability to extend early voting and accept vote-by-mail ballots. But a statement issued by Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner\u2019s office on the order noted, \u201cVoting by fax or email is not an option under the Executive Order.\u201d\n\nSarah Revell, a spokeswoman for Detzner, said in a statement Monday that the Florida Department of State has received reports that Bay County had allowed some voters to submit their ballots via email and fax. She declined to say whether Andersen may have violated state law.\n\n\u201cSupervisors of Elections are independently elected constitutional officers and it is each supervisor\u2019s responsibility to adhere to the law at all times,\u201d Revell said.\n\nCounties varied in their confidence of completing the machine recount by Thursday.\n\nOfficials in Broward, a Democratic stronghold, were testing machines and preparing paper ballots for a tabulation that had yet to begin. Snipes said she was confident that the machine recount would be completed by the deadline.\n\nRepublicans continue to call for the ouster of Snipes, who previously has battled accusations of mismanagement. On Monday, former governor Jeb Bush (R), who appointed Snipes in 2003, called for her removal from office following the recounts, alleging in a tweet that Snipes had \u201cfailed to comply with Florida law on multiple counts.\u201d\n\nIn Palm Beach County, officials were less certain. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give it all we got; we\u2019ll see how it goes,\u201d Susan Bucher, the county\u2019s supervisor of elections, said when asked whether the county recount would be done by Thursday.\n\nAnne Gannon, Palm Beach County tax collector, said officials may ask for an extension if necessary Thursday.\n\nThe county\u2019s tabulation machines being used in the recount are 10 years old, said Gannon, a Democrat. And they can read only one race at a time, which means ballots will have to be fed through the machines four times to count the four close races: U.S. Senate, governor, agriculture commissioner and a local state House seat.\n\n\u201cMy understanding is that the more times a ballot goes through one of the machines, the more chances are that it will be damaged and have to be duplicated,\u201d Gannon said.\n\nSonmez reported from Washington, and Sullivan reported from Tallahassee. Alice Crites and John Wagner in Washington, Beth Reinhard in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Lori Rozsa in Palm Beach contributed to this report.", "Now that Democrats will control the House, they have free rein to launch as many investigations into President Trump and his administration as they would like.

Orrin G. Hatch (Utah). The other two living recipients are former NFL greats Roger Staubach and Alan Page, who was also a Minnesota state Supreme Court justice. Posthumous medals are being awarded to Babe Ruth, Elvis Presley and Antonin Scalia.\n\nThe inclusion of Adelson is easily the most questionable. The Adelsons have donated hundreds of millions of dollars to electing Republicans, including Trump, and were the largest GOP donors in the 2018 election. The White House\u2019s news release makes no mention of this, instead focusing on Miriam Adelson\u2019s drug-addiction research and her support for Jewish organizations.\n\nBut Adelson\u2019s medal reflects a growing pattern: one of Trump awarding a large majority of such medals and even pardons to supporters, to Republicans, and to recipients who fit his political agenda.\n\n\n\nSheldon Adelson sits with his wife, Miriam Adelson, before a session at the President's Conference in Jerusalem, May 13, 2008. (Tara Todras-Whitehill/AP)\n\nOf the 15 pardons/commutations and Medals of Freedom that Trump has given, nine have gone to such recipients. Of the 11 such awards given to living people, eight have been politically oriented.\n\nIn addition to Adelson and Hatch, Trump has pardoned conservatives Joe Arpaio and Dinesh D\u2019Souza, both high-profile Trump supporters. Staubach has not publicly supported Trump, but he has been a GOP donor for decades. Scalia was a conservative icon on the court \u2014 somebody Trump aimed to emulate with his appointments of Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh. The White House\u2019s release even refers in coded language to Scalia\u2019s conservative, originalist judicial philosophy:\n\nAntonin Scalia was one of the greatest Supreme Court justices in American history. Confirmed unanimously in 1986, Justice Scalia authored nearly 900 Supreme Court opinions. He was a champion of the Constitution, insisting that the role of Federal judges is to uphold the original meaning of the Constitution\u2014never to impose their own beliefs on the country. Justice Scalia\u2019s legal philosophy is rooted in America\u2019s founding principles, legal heritage, and constitutional obligations. He never backed down from the bedrock proposition that the Constitution \u201cmeans and will always mean what it meant when it was adopted.\u201d\n\nThe pardons of I. Lewis \u201cScooter\u201d Libby, Kristian Saucier, and Dwight and Steven Hammond occupy more of a political gray area, but they also clearly fit with Trump\u2019s political purposes.\n\nLibby was among the many people Trump has argued were \u201ctreated unfairly\u201d by the very same Justice Department he now alleges is treating him unfairly in the Russia investigation (D\u2019Souza and Arpaio were also treated \u201cvery unfairly\u201d and \u201cunbelievably unfairly,\u201d according to Trump). Saucier\u2019s story also fits this strategy; the former Navy sailor\u2019s one-year sentence for taking photos inside a submarine was regularly cited by Trump as proof that Hillary Clinton got off easy. The Hammonds\u2019 case is the one that spurred the standoff between the government and right-wing militia groups at Oregon\u2019s Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016. A similar standoff two years earlier briefly became a conservative cause celebre, and as with the D\u2019Souza and Arpaio pardons, the Hammonds' pardons seemed geared toward signaling solidarity with more extreme elements of the conservative coalition.\n\nNot all of Trump\u2019s pardons/commutations and Medals of Freedom have had such a political tinge. Alice Marie Johnson\u2019s commutation (which was pushed by Kim Kardashian) was pretty bipartisan, as was the commutation of Sholom Rubashkin\u2019s bank fraud sentence. Boxer Jack Johnson\u2019s pardon has been in the works for years and years. And nobody is going to argue with medals for Presley, Ruth and Page (least of all this Vikings fan).\n\nIt\u2019s also hardly unprecedented for presidents to award pardons/commutations and Medals of Freedom to supporters. Barack Obama awarded several Medals of Freedom to big-name Democrats, George W. Bush initially commuted Libby\u2019s sentence, and Bill Clinton pardoned Marc Rich. But, generally, these awards have been less obviously partisan and/or self-serving when taken as a whole. Obama also awarded Medals of Freedom to two congressional Republicans and to former president George H.W. Bush, a Republican. George W. Bush picked Democrats for two of the four medals he awarded to members of Congress and also honored two Democratic Cabinet secretaries. And usually, obviously political pardons come when a president is a lame duck, as was the case with the Rich pardon.\n\nTrump has been, as with so many other things, pretty blatant about his intentions and unconcerned with looking as if he is wielding such powers for his own purposes. The Adelson example is the clearest to date \u2014 a rather stunning, high-profile award to the largest benefactor of the president\u2019s political party \u2014 but it fits a well-established and growing pattern.", "LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s National Health Service said Monday that it has pulled out of a contentious agreement that gave government officials access to confidential patient data to help track down people suspected of breaking immigration laws.\n\nSome doctors and lawmakers objected to the data-sharing, saying it violated doctor-patient confidentiality and left sick people fearful of seeking medical help.\n\nAfter human-rights campaigners mounted a legal challenge, the government said in May that it was suspending the agreement while new terms were drawn up that narrowed the data-sharing to cases of \u201cserious criminality.\u201d\n\nThe health service\u2019s IT agency, NHS Digital, said Monday it had received a \u201crevised narrowed request\u201d for information-sharing and would consider whether it was in the public interest.\n\nIn the meantime, it said it has \u201cformally closed-out\u201d its participation in the existing agreement.\n\nImmigration is a divisive issue in Britain, and reducing the number of newcomers was a major factor behind the 2016 vote to leave the European Union.

(Paul Harris/Getty Images)\n\nMore than three decades ago, Michael D. Griffin was at the center of the military\u2019s \u201cStar Wars\u201d initiative, working to realize President Ronald Reagan\u2019s dream of shielding the United States from Soviet missiles like \u201ca roof protects a family from rain.\u201d\n\nNow the 69-year-old scientist is back at the Pentagon as its top technology official, looking to revive some of the same missile defense concepts that proponents credited with helping end the Cold War and detractors ridiculed as the excesses of a hawkish Hollywood president.\n\nIt is not only Griffin who has returned to the Pentagon. So, too, has the zeal of a great-power arms race reminiscent of the rivalry with the Soviet Union. Drawing on robust defense funding from Congress, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is embarking on a vast overhaul of the U.S. military to take aim at threats from Russia and China.\n\nAs part of the overhaul, Vice President Pence is leading President Trump\u2019s push for a new Space Force. Though critics say the initiative risks an arms race in space, Pence has argued that space has been militarized since the launch of Sputnik and that the U.S. armed forces must move faster than Russia and China to dominate the domain. The same outlook extends to missile defense.\n\n\u201cWe have renewed great power competition,\u201d Griffin said in an interview. \u201cWell, great powers regrettably aim missiles at one another.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s, Reagan and his close advisers largely took the lead in advancing the Strategic Defense Initiative, which critics later dubbed \u201cStar Wars\u201d for its science-fiction timbre and epic budget.\n\n\n\nIn 2008, then-NASA Administrator Michael Griffin speaks at a news conference at the Kennedy Space Center. (Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMore recently, Congress has been leading the charge. The latest defense policy bill, which Trump signed into law in August, requires the Pentagon to work on plans to detect and possibly one day shoot down missiles from space, and find ways to intercept missiles shortly after they are launched. Other legislation has pushed investment in high-power lasers to blunt multiple missiles one after the other, which Griffin wants to prioritize.\n\nWhether any of the efforts come to fruition depends partly on the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to refocus the nation\u2019s missile defense program, which since the end of the Cold War has concentrated on combating accidental launches or limited attacks from North Korea and Iran.\n\n\u201cFor smaller-scale attacks, we hope to be able to deflect those entirely,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cFor larger-scale attacks, we hope to confound the enemy\u2019s planning to such a degree that they cannot be certain of an assured first strike. That\u2019s fundamentally what we are trying to do with missile defense.\u201d\n\nTop officials in the administration sent a draft of the Defense Department\u2019s new missile defense policy back to the drawing board early this year after arguing that the strategy didn\u2019t sufficiently address burgeoning threats from Russia and China. More than half a year later, the policy hasn\u2019t been released. Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan has told reporters that the strategy is finished, even though the administration hasn\u2019t made it public.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s next budget request, due out sometime in February, is likely to indicate how much the Pentagon wants to reorient missile defense. While missile defense has received substantive funding in recent years, to a tune of about $12 billion a year, much of the money has gone to increasing the number of existing systems rather than introducing new technologies.\n\nNow that the Democrats have taken control of the House, they could seek to scale back any push for weaponized missile defenses in space, as the ballooning deficit forces harder choices on spending and critics raise doubts about the technology.\n\nGriffin, meanwhile, is pressing ahead.\n\nHe still speaks with passion about the possibilities for missile defense more than three decades after he ran the launch team at the Strategic Defense Initiative for what he described as the first space intercept of a target being powered in flight.\n\n\n\nA test of a modified Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile with a dummy warhead also took place from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California in 2000. (Bill Morson/Getty Images)\n\nAs the rocket debris trailed down over Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific, Griffin understood that the purpose of his achievement was not only to demonstrate a rudimentary proof of concept but also to show Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, ahead of the high-stakes 1986 summit in Reykjavik, Iceland, that missile defense was something Moscow would struggle to counter.\n\n\u201cThe test was, if you will, techno-political,\u201d Griffin recalled.\n\nThe former NASA administrator hoped the missile defense projects he was working on during the Reagan era would blossom into operational systems but expresses little surprise many of them didn\u2019t. Even today, his engineer\u2019s enthusiasm for missile defenses in space belies a recognition, as he put it, that \u201cthis stuff is going to be done by my successor\u2019s successor\u2019s successor.\u201d\n\nGriffin supports the Pentagon\u2019s effort to study interceptors in space that could take down ballistic missiles on ascent in their \u201cboost phase.\u201d He also backs the push to invest heavily in lasers.\n\nBut first and foremost, he said, the United States must put a network of satellite surveillance sensors in space to detect missile threats in real time at every location in the world.\n\nThe Pentagon is particularly concerned about super-fast and agile precision-guided missiles under development in China that could put U.S. ships and bases at risk during a conflict in Asia.\n\nGriffin characterized plans for a sensor network in space as a necessary response to Russia and China\u2019s pursuit of hypersonic missiles, or maneuverable missiles faster than the speed of sound that could hit any target in the world in an hour or two and easily pierce existing defenses.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re never going to hit a target you don\u2019t know is coming,\u201d Griffin said.\n\nThe idea is for the Pentagon to use a couple hundred satellites \u2014 as few as 120 or as many as 300, according to Griffin \u2014 with advanced sensors to track missiles from the moment they launch and relay their movements almost immediately. The missile trackers would talk to one another and to installations on the ground in an \u201cInternet protocol-like fashion,\u201d according to Griffin.\n\n\u201cI need persistent, global, timely awareness of what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the Chinese, for example, in a conflict in the western Pacific, choose to launch hypersonic threats at our forward bases or carriers, we want to know where those are coming from. It\u2019s not our purpose to let them have an infinite number of free shots.\u201d\n\nThe Defense Department could build the satellites or essentially rent capacity on satellite platforms that private space industry firms are planning to launch into orbit for other purposes.\n\n\u201cMany companies have offered up plans that would feature the deployment of hundreds or even thousands of low-altitude satellites for communications or Earth observations,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cOne of our ideas is to order an extra 200 buses from them, put our own sensors on it and deploy it in that fashion.\u201d\n\nGriffin said the United States could have such a surveillance constellation \u201cin play\u201d by 2022 or 2023 \u201cif we were really serious and concerned the way we have been about some things in the past.\u201d\n\nAs for the cost, he estimated the sensor constellation could be completed for several billion dollars. If the Pentagon produces its own satellites, the project could cost closer to $10 billion, he said.\n\nAny effort to go beyond sensors and put weapons into space that can intercept missiles is far more fraught and uncertain. At the direction of Congress, the Missile Defense Agency is studying the possibility.\n\nSo far, the interceptors would only be capable of going after ballistic missiles rather than hypersonic missiles. In any case, Griffin said, the space sensor network for missiles should come first.\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s missile defense policy, if it is released, and February budget request could indicate whether the administration intends to advance an effort to put interceptors in space beyond the study stage. Washington\u2019s withdrawal in 2002 from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Moscow gives the United States more leeway to develop those technologies.\n\nA move in that direction would prompt intense criticism from disarmament advocates, who say such an installation would be overly costly, vulnerable to attack and questionably effective, and possibly provoke a war with Russia and China in a domain that so far has been conflict-free.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t really crossed that, where countries have decided to station destructive weapons in space. We just haven\u2019t for lots of good reasons,\u201d said Laura Grego, senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cThat\u2019s a useful and important restraint. It does keep the U.S. more safe.\u201d\n\nOthers see the evolution of space into a war-fighting domain as inevitable.\n\n\u201cWe are already in an arms race,\u201d said Henry \u201cTrey\u201d Obering III, a retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant general and former director of the Missile Defense Agency, who now works on high-energy lasers at the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton.\n\nLaser weaponry, the technology perhaps most evocative of the Reagan era, is still a ways away from being able to take down missiles for the U.S. military, particularly from space.\n\nAccording to Griffin, the Pentagon is again giving serious consideration to neutral particle beams, sometimes called ray guns, which officials explored during the Star Wars era to down missiles from space.\n\n\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan shows support for the Strategic Defense Initiative, nicknamed Star Wars, with a bumper sticker reading \u201cSDI could ruin a nuclear bomb's whole day.\u201d (Bettmann/Bettmann Archive)\n\nNot all of the missile defense concepts the Pentagon is considering are reminiscent of that era or focused on Russia and China.\n\nIn one idea gaining traction, a patrol of high altitude drones or F-35 fighter jets would fly above the waters around North Korea, ready to shoot down any missiles Pyongyang decides to fire in their boost phase or immediately after.\n\nShould the U.S. military proceed with the concept, Griffin said cost would drive the decision between a drone and a fighter jet as the \u201cbasing mode,\u201d and the military would then arm whichever platform it chooses with an air-to-air missile rather than a laser.\n\nHe declined to say how far the military has gone in developing the idea.\n\n\u201cI will leave it that airborne boost-phase defense is of great interest to us at this point,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cIt is technically feasible. We can do it. There are several basing modes. We\u2019d pick the best value for the buck.\u201d", "ROME \u2014 Genoa\u2019s mayor says demolition is planned to start next month on part of the highway bridge whose collapse killed 43 people in August.\n\nMarco Bucci told SkyTG24 TV Monday that demolition of a supporting pillar on one end of the Morandi bridge should begin around Dec. 15.

Zalmay Khalilzad, speaks to reporters at the United Nations headquarters. Taliban officials said Monday, Nov. 12, 2018 that Pakistan has released Abdul Samad Sani, a U.S.-designated terrorist who served as the Afghan Central Bank governor during the militants\u2019 rule, along with a lower-ranking commander named Salahuddin. It came as U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad launched a second tour of the region, with stops in Pakistan, Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates as well as Qatar, where the Taliban maintain a political office. (Mary Altaffer, File/Associated Press)\n\nISLAMABAD \u2014 Pakistan released two Taliban officials on Monday during U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad\u2019s latest visit to the region, in what could be part of American efforts to revive peace talks with the insurgent group, which now controls nearly half of Afghanistan.\n\nAbdul Samad Sani, a U.S.-designated terrorist who served as the Afghan Central Bank governor during the militants\u2019 rule in the late 1990s, and a lower-ranking commander named Salahuddin, were released Monday, according to two Taliban officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media. There was no immediate comment from the Pakistani government.\n\nKhalilzad is on his second regional tour since being appointed, with stops in Pakistan, Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates as well as Qatar, where the Taliban maintain a political office. The insurgents say they met Khalilzad in Qatar last month. Khalilzad arrived in the region last Thursday and will return to Washington on Nov. 20.\n\nWhen Khalilzad was last in the region Pakistan released another Taliban leader, Abdul Ghani Baradar, one of the founders of the radical religious movement. Baradar was arrested in 2010 in a joint U.S. and Pakistani operation. At the time, it was reported Baradar was taken into custody by Pakistan after he tried to open independent peace talks with Afghanistan\u2019s then-president, Hamid Karzai.\n\nIn a recent interview, Karzai told The Associated Press he had repeatedly tried to secure Baradar\u2019s release but he was thwarted by both Pakistan and the U.S., who wanted him detained because of his stature within the Taliban.\n\nBaradar\u2019s release has been a long-standing demand of the Taliban.\n\nEfforts to find a peaceful end to Afghanistan\u2019s protracted war have accelerated in recent months, as a troop surge announced by President Donald Trump last August has done little to change conditions on the ground. In recent months the Taliban have carried out near-daily attacks on Afghan security forces as well as coordinated assaults on major cities.\n\nThe Taliban have long demanded direct talks with the United States, referring to the Kabul government as puppets. Washington has neither confirmed nor denied a meeting between Khalilzad and the Taliban took place last month.\n\nTaliban officials present at the meeting characterized those talks as productive. They said they pressed to have their office in Qatar recognized and agreed to meet again, although no date was set.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s fractious government, which is jointly headed by President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, has been prickly about direct talks between Washington and the Taliban.\n\nIn addition to the three Taliban figures recently freed by Pakistan, five senior members of the Taliban who were freed from the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay in 2014 in exchange for captured U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl have joined the insurgent group\u2019s political office in Qatar.\n\nThe induction of the five has significantly strengthened the ability of the Taliban\u2019s Qatar office to sell a peace deal to insurgents on the battlefield.\n\nSani\u2019s release further reconstitutes the Taliban leadership. Sani was placed on the U.S. terrorist list in January, accused of supplying the Taliban with weapons as well as being a major financier travelling to the Gulf to obtain both money and supplies for the insurgent movement.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Bill Nelson (D) called on his Republican opponent, Gov. Rick Scott, to recuse himself from overseeing the process, and as President Trump alleged without evidence that ballots were missing and forged.\n\nAs local officials scrambled to meet Thursday\u2019s machine-\n\nrecount deadline, lawsuits mounted from all sides \u2014 including a complaint by the League of Women Voters and Common Cause Florida seeking to bar Scott from using his position to influence the ballot-counting process.\n\nEarlier Monday, a state judge rejected a request from Scott to seize voting machines and ballots in closely watched Broward County, ruling there was no evidence of voter fraud.\n\nMeanwhile, Scott pressed forward with plans to travel to Washington this week for orientation activities designed for newly elected senators. \u201cI\u2019m headed to Washington tomorrow to start the process of becoming the next U.S. senator,\u201d Scott said Monday night in an appearance on Fox News.\n\nMachine recounts in Florida\u2019s races for governor, Senate and agriculture commissioner were ordered Saturday because of tight margins in the votes and immediately became the focus of lawsuits by candidates. A more-complicated hand recount could follow in the Senate and agriculture commissioner races, depending on the margins of victory.\n\nThe results in the country\u2019s largest swing state will have repercussions in Washington, where a win by Scott would help Republicans further consolidate their Senate majority.\n\nAs the recount continues, Scott is engaging frequently with national Republicans and pressing wealthy benefactors to donate to his effort. On Tuesday, National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Scott intend to hold a conference call with donors, according to two people familiar with their plans.\n\nMonday began with a combative tweet from Trump claiming that \u201can honest vote count is no longer possible\u201d and that ballots had been \u201cmassively infected.\u201d He argued that the results from the night of the Nov. 6 election should stand, handing victories to Scott, as well as Republican former congressman Ron DeSantis in the gubernatorial contest.\n\n\u201cThe Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged,\u201d the president said in a tweet that misstated what Florida officials have concluded.\n\nUnder state law, ballots from overseas and military voters have until Friday to arrive to be counted.\n\nWhite House officials did not respond to requests for comment about whether the president was referring to those ballots.\n\nOn the ground, both campaigns began mobilizing thousands of volunteers amid growing legal challenges.\n\nRebuffing Scott\u2019s campaign, state Judge Jack Tuter ruled against the governor\u2019s request to have local sheriffs seize ballots and machines in Broward County not in use in the recount. Tuter said that there was no evidence of voter fraud and that Brenda Snipes, the county election supervisor, needs to be allowed to do her job and finish the count.\n\nTuter also appeared to admonish the Scott team for suggesting voter fraud without offering evidence of it.\n\n\u201cEverything the lawyers are saying out there at the elections office is being beamed out across the country. We should be careful what we say,\u201d Tuter said. \u201cThese words mean things these days, as everybody in the room knows.\u201d\n\nTuter\u2019s ruling was on one of at least nine lawsuits that have been filed over the recounts. Scott also has sued to impound ballots and equipment in Palm Beach, although there has not yet been a hearing on that suit.\n\nNew lawsuits Monday include one filed on behalf of VoteVets, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee asking that all mail-in ballots postmarked by last Tuesday be counted. Under current rules, ballots must be received by 7 p.m. on Election Day.\n\nA separate suit by the League of Women Voters and the nonprofit watchdog group Common Cause Florida asks to bar Scott from using \u201cthe power of his office in any manner related to Florida\u2019s 2018 Senate race as long as he remains a candidate.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s \u201cmisuse of his official powers in favor of his own candidacy demonstrates the truth of the axiom that no man may be the judge in his own cause,\u201d the lawsuit stated.\n\nThe suit echoes Nelson\u2019s call earlier Monday for Scott to recuse himself from the recount. \u201cHe\u2019s thrown around words like \u2018voter fraud\u2019 without any proof,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nIn a Fox News television appearance earlier, Scott called Nelson a \u201csore loser\u201d and alleged that \u201che\u2019s just here to steal this election.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, a court will hear a request from Nelson to reexamine absentee and provisional ballots that were not counted because signatures did not match.\n\nScott\u2019s team is bracing for the likely prospect of a manual recount. They are planning to have at least one lawyer in each of the state\u2019s 67 counties if a manual recount is triggered.\n\nScott already has lined up more than 7,500 recount volunteers. Larger concentrations of volunteers will appear in more-populous counties and areas where Republicans have pointed to issues in vote counting, including Broward and Palm Beach, according to his campaign.\n\nDemocrats say they will muster similar cavalry.\n\n\u201cWe will easily match that number,\u201d said Charles Lichtman, one of the lawyers working on behalf of Nelson. \u201cI look forward to this being, you know, the \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 final scene\u201d \u2014 in which the Republicans lose, he added.\n\nLichtman said he is in charge of recruiting, training volunteers, positioning them in the right places, making sure they follow the law and \u201cmaking sure every vote gets counted.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the recount process was further roiled by the revelation that voters in Bay County, which was hit by Hurricane Michael, had been allowed to submit ballots by email, in apparent violation of state law.\n\nBay County Supervisor of Elections Mark Andersen said in an interview with local TV stations WJHG and WECP on Friday that he had allowed 147 voters to return their ballots by email. Anyone who wants to take away those votes \u201cought to be ashamed of yourselves because what we did is take care of voters,\u201d Andersen said in the interview.\n\nScott issued an executive order Oct. 18 giving election supervisors in eight counties that were hit hard by the hurricane the ability to extend early voting and accept vote-by-mail ballots. But a statement issued by Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner\u2019s office on the order noted, \u201cVoting by fax or email is not an option under the Executive Order.\u201d\n\nSarah Revell, a spokeswoman for Detzner, said in a statement Monday that the Florida Department of State has received reports that Bay County had allowed some voters to submit their ballots via email and fax. She declined to say whether Andersen may have violated state law.\n\n\u201cSupervisors of Elections are independently elected constitutional officers and it is each supervisor\u2019s responsibility to adhere to the law at all times,\u201d Revell said.\n\nCounties varied in their confidence of completing the machine recount by Thursday.\n\nOfficials in Broward, a Democratic stronghold, were testing machines and preparing paper ballots for a tabulation that had yet to begin. Snipes said she was confident that the machine recount would be completed by the deadline.\n\nRepublicans continue to call for the ouster of Snipes, who previously has battled accusations of mismanagement. On Monday, former governor Jeb Bush (R), who appointed Snipes in 2003, called for her removal from office following the recounts, alleging in a tweet that Snipes had \u201cfailed to comply with Florida law on multiple counts.\u201d\n\nIn Palm Beach County, officials were less certain. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give it all we got; we\u2019ll see how it goes,\u201d Susan Bucher, the county\u2019s supervisor of elections, said when asked whether the county recount would be done by Thursday.\n\nAnne Gannon, Palm Beach County tax collector, said officials may ask for an extension if necessary Thursday.\n\nThe county\u2019s tabulation machines being used in the recount are 10 years old, said Gannon, a Democrat. And they can read only one race at a time, which means ballots will have to be fed through the machines four times to count the four close races: U.S. Senate, governor, agriculture commissioner and a local state House seat.\n\n\u201cMy understanding is that the more times a ballot goes through one of the machines, the more chances are that it will be damaged and have to be duplicated,\u201d Gannon said.\n\nSonmez reported from Washington, and Sullivan reported from Tallahassee.

(Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nIf Americans were unaware of the enormity of the Great War\u2019s impact on Europe, they might have gained some insights watching the events marking the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, the \u201cwar to end all wars\u201d that instead paved the way for a second horrific world war. The ceremonies and the magnificent public art displays help us grasp the mind-boggling loss of men, the physical damage to Europe and the profound impact World War I had on everything from women\u2019s rights to faith in technology as a force for human progress.\n\nThe Fading Battlefields of World War I - 32 images from tortured European landscapes, where the sounds of gunfire that killed so many were silenced when the war ended, a century ago today. https://t.co/4M3MRYGbCR #ArmisticeDay100 #WWIcentenary pic.twitter.com/tJSm5Q6i7J \u2014 The Atlantic Photo (@TheAtlPhoto) November 11, 2018\n\nThe commemorations also underscored the magnificent achievement of the post-World War II international liberal order \u2014 which prevented any wars of this magnitude, ushered in decades of prosperity and drew bitter enemies in to close alliances. One truly has to have a heart of stone and a lack of any understanding of the 20th century not to be moved by the sight of leaders of the European nations walking together in the rain down the Champs-Elysees or the obvious personal affection between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nMacron\u2019s speech was a perfectly delivered argument for preserving the international order and rejecting President Trump\u2019s noxious nationalism. Macron explained, \u201cPatriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism. Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism. By putting our own interests first, with no regard for others, we erase the very thing that a nation holds dearest, and the thing that keeps it alive: its moral values.\u201d He continued, \u201cOld demons are rising again. New ideologies are manipulating religions, and history is threatening to repeat its tragedies. Let us vow once more as nations to ensure peace is the utmost priority, above all else, because we know what it cost.\u201d\n\nThe solemnity and introspection of the world leaders stood in contrast to Trump\u2019s nonattendance at a joint visit on Saturday to a cemetery (begging off because his helicopter was grounded due to weather, although other leaders managed to get there). More important, the tone of the proceedings contrasted with Trump\u2019s juvenile attitude toward the military. Like a young child, he loves the pomp, and like a tin pot dictator, he likes to order about the military as if they were his own personal guards \u2014 though he has yet to visit them in a combat zone. (Is this his physical cowardice or his fear of comparison between his record \u2014 he escaped Vietnam due to \u201cbone spurs\u201d \u2014 and our brave, selfless men and women overseas?) Trump alone, physically and metaphorically, was the perfect reminder of the scourge of isolationism, xenophobia and nationalism.\n\nTrump never seemed so small or as inadequate for the job as he did this weekend \u2014 when once more, in place of a representative of America\u2019s moral core, there was a void. Without empathy or curiosity or historical knowledge or grace, Trump flops on such occasions, reminding progressives of the need for U.S. leadership in the world and reminding conservatives that for all their criticism of President Barack Obama, he conducted himself with great dignity at these occasions.\n\nOne can only imagine what the right would have done (call for impeachment?) had Obama begged off a cemetery visit or snubbed allies or sulked like a spoiled child. Today\u2019s Republicans rationalize (because they are cowardly or intellectually corrupt) their support for a president who in every way is inferior to his predecessors and who acts with disdain for the principles they supposedly held. The challenge for the country and our allies is to hold it \u2014 the Western democratic experiment \u2014 together until a U.S. president worthy of the office in the mold of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy or really any other modern president can replace Trump.\n\nThe West is fortunate to have Macron, Merkel and other responsible leaders \u2014 as well as the strength of the U.S. military \u2014 to keep the peace for now. But without a competent president who understands that America is the indispensable power \u2014 because it acts or aspires to act on universal values \u2014 free people remain at risk.\n\nRead more:\n\nA bittersweet commemoration exposes ominous rifts in our new world order\n\nTrump should use his trip to France to learn a few simple lessons from history\n\nTrump shows his contempt for the men and women in uniform", "\n\nBroccoli Bar, a bar and pizza restaurant, is a new collaboration between &pizza and the Broccoli City Festival. (Photo by Shaughn Cooper.)\n\nIs there a better pairing than pizza and beer? How about &pizza and the Broccoli City Festival?\n\nThe latest cultural remix in Shaw finds &pizza, the customizable pizza chain that has spread from H Street NE to New York, Philadelphia and beyond, collaborating on a bar and restaurant with the creators of Broccoli City, the vibrant music festival that has brought Cardi B, Migos and Solange to town for concerts for Earth Day.\n\n[A guide to the best happy hours in D.C.]\n\nDubbed Broccoli Bar and perched above the entrance to the Shaw-Howard University Metro in the former Uprising bakery space, the new venue celebrates its diversity and community while trying to rework the happy-hour model.\n\nBroccoli Bar\u2019s happy hour runs from 5 to 10 p.m. every day, long after most similar discounts have wrapped up. And it does more than just offer drink specials \u2014 in this case, $6 draft beer and wine. &pizza co-founder and CEO Michael Lastoria wants to change \u201cwhat a happy hour can be.\u201d\n\nOn a recent Friday evening, the tour DJ for Grammy-nominated rapper GoldLink spun a set for a diverse crowd sipping cocktails and eating pizza in that window between after-work and going-out. But if you didn't know about the special guest supplying the tunes, \u201cyou might not have noticed,\u201d says Broccoli City co-founder Brandon McEachern.\n\nMaking casual nightlife vibes accessible to 9-to-5ers is one of the goals of Broccoli Bar\u2019s happy hour: \u201cTypically, to get that curated set, it has to be at a nightclub, or late at night,\u201d Lastoria says. \u201cHaving that experience at 5 or 6 o\u2019clock is something we haven\u2019t seen.\u201d\n\nBesides, McEachern adds, \u201cI know a lot of people who have jobs and get up at 8 a.m.,\u201d and with this happy hour, \u201cYou get to have that party experience and get up the next day.\u201d\n\nThe unexpected partnership between &pizza and Broccoli City began in 2017, when Lastoria was invited to speak at a conference attached to the festival. The relationship that sprouted was \u201cextremely quick and extremely organic,\u201d McEachern says, because the festival and the chain have similar audiences, though \u201cwe bring people in from different sides of the diaspora.\"\n\n[The happy hour destination you probably never thought of: Fast-casual restaurants]\n\nTheir collaboration, hatched at this year\u2019s South by Southwest music festival, brings in elements from both groups: &pizza\u2019s familiar black-and-white aesthetic gets punched up with green plants hanging over the angular bar and throughout the restaurant, and the omnipresent ampersands are paired with silhouettes of broccoli florets. The large outdoor patio, located at the top of the Metro escalators, will be getting a new look early next year, with what Lastoria calls \u201cbeer-garden-esque foliage.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe signature Mad Cheddar pizza at Broccoli Bar is topped with broccoli, pickled red onions and cheddar beer cheese. (Photo by Fritz Hahn/The Washington Post)\n\nThe menu reads like the greatest hits of &pizza\u2019s menu; perhaps inevitably, there also is a pizza topped with broccoli \u2014 and pickled red onions and beer cheese. It\u2019s the first of what Lastoria says will be a series of \u201climited-time pies\u201d not available at other locations. (One note: Although their pizzas can still be customized in endless ways, ordering doesn\u2019t involve following an assembly line, as at other &pizzas. Just tell your server what you want, and they bring it over.) Brunch brings an avocado toast pie and $20 carafes of sparkling cocktails. Speaking of drinks, Broccoli Bar\u2019s beverage menu doesn\u2019t get too fancy, with drinks like the Ossie Davis (whiskey, Cotton and Reed\u2019s allspice dram and bitters) and the sweet, citrusy Grown Folks Lemonade, made with limoncello, vodka, lemonade and fresh mint.\n\nBut as with happy hour, Broccoli Bar's founders are thinking beyond the food.\n\nA few years ago, Broccoli City launched an app called Chip\u2019N (pronounced \u201cchip in\") allowing users to earn rewards, such as tickets to the Broccoli City or Afropunk festivals, by volunteering to clean up a park or mentor a child. McEachern says Broccoli Bar will continue along that community-minded path: \u201cWe\u2019ll be doing things where people can come in and make lunch bags for the homeless, and then go out and distribute them.\u201d On the first Saturday of the month, the restaurant plans to organize community service days \u2014 the first of which involves working on flower beds and mulching pathways for the Howard University Community Garden.\n\nRegular \u201cBroccoli Talks\u201d will bring in special guests, such as community activist Tony Lewis Jr., who spoke about prison reform last week; Christopher Bradshaw, who is working to provide greater access to healthy food in underserved urban communities, is scheduled for Wednesday. It\u2019s special, McEachern says, \u201cto have the ability to program in that space and not just serve pizza.\u201d With these types of events, \u201cyoung people are getting the chance to see [the speakers] and say, \u2018That\u2019s what I can possibly be.\u2019 That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to provide.\u201d\n\nBroccoli Bar, 1817 Seventh St. NW.

They had planned to vote Wednesday on a code of conduct, the first such ethical guidelines for bishops on sex abuse issues, and to establish a lay commission capable of investigating bishops\u2019 misconduct.\n\nInstead, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo -- the president of the U.S. bishops' conference -- told the group that the Vatican\u2019s Congregation for Bishops had asked the bishops not to take action until after a worldwide meeting of church leaders in February.\n\n\u201cAt the insistence of the Holy See, we will not be voting on the two action items,\u201d DiNardo said, adding that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the Vatican\u2019s move.\n\n[The 2018 Catholic clergy sex abuse crisis brings new energy \u2014 and anti-gay activists \u2014 into the survivors' movement]\n\nMoments later, in what appeared to be an oblique reference to the bishops\u2019 lay commission proposal and the growing number of U.S. state and federal investigations into the Catholic Church, the Vatican\u2019s ambassador to the United States warned the bishops not to rely on outside investigations.\n\n\u201cThere may be a temptation on the part of some to relinquish responsibility for reform to others from ourselves, as if we were no longer capable of reforming or trusting ourselves,\u201d Archbishop Christophe Pierre, a French bishop who was sent by Pope Francis to Washington from France in 2016, said. \u201cAssistance is both welcome and necessary, and surely collaboration with the laity is essential. However, the responsibility as bishops of this Catholic Church is ours.\u201d\n\nPierre quoted a French author who said that \u201cwhoever pretends to reform the church with the same means to reform temporal society\u201d will \u201cfail.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear what, if anything, the three-day meeting will now accomplish on the topic of abuse. Leaders said that the bishops will still spend Tuesday and Wednesday debating and fine-tuning their proposals, as planned.\n\nCardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago quickly proposed an alternative to the Vatican\u2019s request that no vote be taken. He suggested a nonbinding vote at this session, followed by an additional meeting of all the bishops in March \u2014 after Francis\u2019s worldwide meeting \u2014 to formally vote on these policies as soon as possible.\n\nSome bishops said the Vatican\u2019s request alone damages American leaders' efforts to regain parishioners' trust, after a longtime church leader -- ex-cardinal Theodore McCarrick -- was revealed this year to have allegedly sexually harassed and molested multiple victims, and after a Pennsylvania grand jury report documented decades of abuse by hundreds of priests.\n\n\u201cThis kind of thing is a blow to what we\u2019re trying to overcome here in the United States \u2013 the perception of a hierarchy that is unresponsive to the reality of the tragedy,\u201d said Jefferson City Bishop Shawn McKnight.\n\nHe said bishops need to be able to call out and challenge people over them \u2013 meaning members of the Roman Curia, which would be a major shift in an extremely hierarchical faith.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m beginning to wonder if we need to look at a resolution where we refuse to participate in any kind of cover-up from those above us,\u201d McKnight, who became a bishop nine months ago, said. \u201cIt\u2019s for the good of the church. We have to be respectful of the Roman Curia but also we have an obligation to our people. And our priests.\u201d\n\nOther bishops, including Bishop Christopher Coyne, appeared less perturbed by the Vatican-imposed delay \u2014 even suggesting that it might be for the best.\n\n\u201cMy first reaction was: \u2018Oh boy, this won\u2019t go over well,\u2019 because they\u2019ll see it as a political,\u201d said Coyne, head of the USCCB\u2019s communications committee and Vermont\u2019s only bishop who had expressed skepticism last week that the bishops needed a code of conduct. Now he views Rome\u2019s intervention as a reminder that the Catholic Church \u201cis a universal church.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe in the U.S. can have a limited view of the worldwide church,\u201d he said. \u201c...It would be difficult if we came up with [different] policies and procedures.\u201d\n\nEven as he reiterated his disappointment, DiNardo also referenced the need to defer to Rome.\n\n\u201cWe are Roman Catholic bishops, in communion with our Holy Father in Rome. And he has people around him who are what we call congregations or offices, and we\u2019re responsible to them, in that communion of faith,\u201d DiNardo said in an afternoon press conference.\n\nIn its rush to respond to the crisis that re-emerged in June, DiNardo said the U.S. bishops informed the Vatican of their general plans for their meeting in September and October. But they did not present the precise documents -- including the code of conduct for bishops -- that the body would be debating at this meeting until about Oct. 30, he said. On Sunday night, DiNardo got the letter from the Congregation for Bishops, the powerful Vatican body, which DiNardo said also raised questions of whether the documents ran afoul of some fine points of canon law.\n\nHe said he did not know if Pope Francis himself had issued the order to postpone voting.\n\nDiNardo also raised the possibility that Vatican leaders were concerned about American bishops setting a standard on their own, instead of working with their fellow church leaders globally at the February meeting.\n\nAfter the ambassador spoke Monday, DiNardo said that the U.S. bishops remain committed to their proposals.\n\n\u201cBrother bishops, to exempt ourselves from this high standard of accountability is unacceptable and cannot stand,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether we will be regarded as guardians of the abused or the abuser will be determined by our actions.\u201d\n\nThen the bishops adjourned for their planned day of prayer \u2014 which was supposed to precede two days of debate and voting on concrete proposals \u2014 leaving stunned abuse survivors and church insiders to discuss what had just happened.\n\nBecky Ianni, the D.C. regional head for SNAP \u2014 the most established survivor advocacy group \u2014 said that she was frustrated by the surprise announcement.\u201d We\u2019re dealing [in the U.S.] with the crisis, right here, right now,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a global problem, and they need to discuss it there, but the U.S. needs to come up with something right now.\u201d\n\nDuring the day of prayer, two clergy abuse survivors were invited to speak to the bishops. Luis A. Torres Jr. told the bishops, \u201cAbuse of a child is the closest that you can get to murder and still possibly have a breathing body before you. When a child had been abused, particularly by someone whom they trust, you have destroyed the child.\u201d\n\nHe asked the question that he said he learned to ask in church: What would Jesus do? \u201cWould he have called his lawyers and denounced the victims? Or would he have turned over the tables in a fit of rage and declared that this was intolerable in his father\u2019s house?\u201d Torres said. \u201cI ask [for] your action, which is needed right now. Not in three months. Not in six months. Yesterday.\u201d", "Mohammad al-Otaibi, Saudi Arabia\u2019s consul general in Istanbul at the time, is interviewed by Reuters reporters on Oct. 6 at the Saudi Consulate. (Osman Orsal/Reuters)\n\nAs Mohammad al-Otaibi walked a team of reporters through the rooms of the six-story Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, he avoided eye contact and buried his hands in the pockets of his suit pants. In a cartoonish display, he opened filing cabinets and cupboards to demonstrate that journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who had vanished four days earlier, was not inside.\n\nOtaibi, the Saudi consul general in Istanbul, had never been a high-profile diplomat. But that changed on Oct. 6 with his guided tour for Reuters reporters, and he instantly became the face of Saudi denials that Khashoggi had been kidnapped or was killed inside the consulate. He insisted that Khashoggi had left through one of the building\u2019s two entrances.\n\nSaudi officials would eventually admit that Khashoggi had been killed inside their diplomatic mission, but by then Otaibi was gone. He had returned to Saudi Arabia. And though the kingdom would detain or fire more than 20 people in connection with the slaying, Otaibi was not among them. In fact, he has not been heard from for weeks.\n\nOtaibi, Saudi Arabia\u2019s senior diplomat in Istanbul, left Turkey on Oct. 16, a day before his official residence was searched by Turkish investigators and three days before Saudi Arabia conceded that Khashoggi had indeed been killed inside the mission.\n\nTurkish investigators concluded that Saudi officials had dispatched a 15-man hit squad from Riyadh that killed Khashoggi and dismembered his body. Those 15 Saudis were among 18 people arrested in Saudi Arabia. Five others, including four intelligence officials and a senior adviser to the royal court, were dismissed from their jobs.\n\nThat Otaibi appears to have escaped punishment so far has rankled senior Turkish officials, who see him at the least as a key witness and accessory in the killing, as well as a liar. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has singled him out twice as having a role in the coverup, saying in a Washington Post op-ed that Otaibi had \u201clied through his teeth\u201d and fled the country.\n\n\u201cThough Riyadh has detained 18 suspects, it is deeply concerning that no action has been taken against the Saudi consul general,\u201d the Turkish leader wrote.\n\nMore than a week earlier, during a speech to his party members in parliament, Erdogan accused Otaibi of thwarting the efforts of Turkish investigators by refusing entry into the consulate in the early days of the investigation. \u201cI voiced some things about his incompetence . . . to the [Saudi] king,\u201d Erdogan said, adding that Otaibi was recalled from Istanbul after Erdogan\u2019s conversation with Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman.\n\nSaudi officials have refused to discuss Otaibi, and the Saudi Foreign Ministry did not respond to requests for comment and clarification on Otaibi\u2019s diplomatic status. Efforts to reach Otaibi through the ministry were unsuccessful.\n\nErdogan\u2019s comments about the consul general underscore Turkey\u2019s frustration with how Saudi Arabia has handled the probe into the killing, with Turkish officials repeatedly accusing Riyadh of obstructing investigators and destroying evidence.\n\nTurkish officials have accused the Saudis of stalling searches of the consulate building and the consul general\u2019s residence, which some members of the alleged hit squad visited after leaving the nearby consulate. By the time Turkish investigators were allowed in, the consulate and residence had been thoroughly cleaned.\n\nTurkey\u2019s frustrations were compounded with the visit to Istanbul late last month of the chief Saudi prosecutor, who Turkish officials said was more interested in finding out what evidence Turkey had on the operation than in sharing any information about the 18 suspects detained in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe kingdom, meantime, has shifted its story multiple times since the initial denials from Otaibi and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who told Bloomberg News just a day after the killing that Khashoggi had left the consulate soon after he entered it.\n\nOtaibi, who was named consul general in Istanbul in late 2016 after postings in Nigeria and Indonesia, has emerged as a central figure in Turkey\u2019s assessment that Khashoggi\u2019s killing was premeditated and that an elaborate coverup was planned.\n\nGiven his role as the senior diplomat in the consulate, Turkish authorities have been skeptical of the notion that Otaibi was an unwitting bystander to the killing.\n\n\u201cIf there is a murder planned in the consulate, he would be informed about that,\u201d said an adviser to Erdogan who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.\n\nA senior Turkish official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, said: \u201cIf the consul disagreed with the plan, he could have called the Saudi ambassador in Ankara or taken the 45-minute flight there to meet in person. Our assessment is that he was certainly aware of what was going to happen to Jamal Khashoggi.\u201d\n\nTurkish officials say Otaibi\u2019s role as an accessory to the killing of Khashoggi has been firmly established through his early denials and alleged obstructive refusal to give investigators access to the consulate after Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance.\n\nTurkish officials say, however, they remain unsure what role, if any, Otaibi played in the actual killing.\n\nMehdi Eker, a lawmaker and senior member of Erdogan\u2019s party, said the nature of Otaibi\u2019s involvement could be determined if Turkish authorities were allowed to interrogate him as a witness. Eker said he is mystified as to why Otaibi was not among the Saudis arrested or fired over the case.\n\nKhashoggi, a Post contributing columnist and a critic of the Saudi leadership, first visited the consulate on Sept. 28 seeking a document that would certify his divorce and allow him to proceed with a marriage to his Turkish fiancee, Hatice Cengiz.\n\nFriends of Khashoggi\u2019s said the journalist told them that he had met that day with two senior Saudi officials who greeted him warmly and promised to help him with the document.\n\n\u201cThe first met him and took his details and said to him he would now meet another, more senior official who would handle his case,\u201d said Azzam Tamimi, a British Palestinian academic.\n\n\u201cWe were worried, but he assured us that they\u2019d been nice,\u201d Tamimi added. \u201cThese are ordinary folks from my country. They have nothing to do with the decision-makers,\u201d he recalled Khashoggi as saying.\n\nKhashoggi did not specifically mention Otaibi, friends said.\n\nTurkish officials, who are trying to understand the depth of Otaibi\u2019s knowledge of the plot to kill Khashoggi, say they are trying to determine whether he was one of the senior officials with whom Khashoggi met on Sept. 28.\n\nDuring that initial visit to the consulate, Khashoggi suggested Oct. 2 as a date for him to retrieve the document.\n\nTurkey\u2019s public prosecutor said last week that Khashoggi was strangled almost immediately after entering the consulate on Oct. 2.\n\nKevin Sullivan in Riyadh and John Hudson in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nSaudi campaign to abduct and silence rivals abroad goes back decades\n\nA year after the Ritz-Carlton roundup, members of the Saudi elite remain jailed by the crown prince\n\nErdogan says order to kill Khashoggi \u2018came from the highest levels of the Saudi government\u2019\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "\n\nChristian Pulisic, a Borussia Dortmund attacker, is in U.S. camp for the first time since May.

The number of participants and intensity will grow Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have the majority of the guys tomorrow,\u201d Sarachan said amid abundant sunshine and a light breeze.

The Americans will also face Italy next Tuesday in Genk, Belgium.\n\n\u201cThe guys coming over later, we\u2019ll have to decide where they fit in,\u201d Sarachan said.\n\nThat would suggest Ethan Horvath, the only keeper on the field Monday, might end up starting the first match. The other keepers are Guzan and Columbus\u2019s Zack Steffen.\n\nAside from Horvath\u2019s early presence, Sarachan praised the 23-year-old\u2019s performance for Club Brugge in the UEFA Champions League.\n\n\u201cHe was very good in the game against Monaco\u201d last week, Sarachan said. \u201cHe\u2019s seeing minutes now, which is good.\u201d\n\nFor U.S. fans, the most welcome appearance was made by Christian Pulisic, the program\u2019s most dynamic attacker who, because of injuries, summer break and club demands, has made one appearance in the past year.\n\nAsked about Pulisic\u2019s attitude and demeanor in his first camp since May in Philadelphia, Sarachan said, \u201cWatching him in today\u2019s session and afterward, I think he is excited to be here. He is not externally going to show a lot of that, but I can tell, once the whistle blew and we got going, he was engaged in training. Seeing him with the guys, I think he feels that he has missed this a little bit.\u201d\n\nPulisic, who will not be available for interviews with U.S. reporters until Wednesday, could end up starting alongside three other rising standouts: Weston McKennie, Tyler Adams and Tim Weah. The quartet has never been on the roster at the same time.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take long for these guys to get settled and get going because they do know one another, but it has been some time,\u201d Sarachan said. \u201cIt still takes time to get the chemistry back on the field. That\u2019s the disadvantage of these friendlies: We won\u2019t have [almost] everyone until tomorrow and we\u2019ve got the game Thursday.

Gregg Berhalter, a former U.S. defender who has guided the Columbus Crew for five seasons, is the front-runner, and it\u2019s unclear whether Sarachan is under consideration.\n\n\u201cThe whole process for me now is to just get this group ready,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the time we leave next week, I will have a conversation with Earnie.\u201d\n\n>> No matter who is hired, a U.S. squad comprising largely MLS players in their offseason will gather for the annual winter camp in Carson, Calif., the U.S. Soccer Federation confirmed.

(Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nDemocrats won\u2019t actually take control of the House until January, but they\u2019re ready to hit the ground running:\n\nFresh off a resounding midterm elections victory, House Democrats on Sunday began detailing plans to wield their newfound oversight power in the next Congress, setting their sights on acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker while rebuffing calls from some liberals to pursue impeachment proceedings against President Trump.\n\nAs the article above explains, multiple Democrats who will be chairing committees in the new Congress made clear that they already have a clear idea of the matters they\u2019ll be investigating and they\u2019re ready to use their subpoena powers if the administration refuses to cooperate. You can be sure that when all this begins, Republicans will portray it as madness, a chaotic eruption of politically motivated probes with no legitimate purpose. The truth, however, is that Democrats seem to know exactly what they\u2019re doing.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the message they\u2019re trying to get out. Here\u2019s what Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who will chair the House Oversight Committee, said on ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d:\n\nI\u2019m not going to be handing out subpoenas like somebody\u2019s handing out candy on Halloween. I take this as a lawyer and as an officer of the court, I take subpoenas very seriously. And I plan to, if I have to use them, they will be used in a very \u2014 in a methodical way and it must be in the public interest.\n\nAnd here\u2019s what House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d:\n\nWell, we are responsible. We are not scattershot. We are not doing any investigation for a political purpose but to seek the truth. So, I think a word that you could describe about how Democrats will go forward in this regard is we will be very strategic.\n\nYou can dismiss their protestations that none of it has a political purpose as the kind of thing politicians have to say but that fools no one; of course it has a political purpose. But when they describe their investigation plan as a strategic one, you can take them at their word. Pelosi hasn\u2019t stayed in charge of House Democrats for the past 16 years because she doesn\u2019t know how to act strategically.\n\nKeep in mind also that Pelosi has been in this position before. She became House minority leader after the 2002 elections and led Democrats through taking over the House in 2006 and then doing exactly what they want to do now: opposing an unpopular Republican president until a Democratic one could be elected two years later. One of her greatest strengths has been her ability to persuade everyone in her caucus to move in the same direction and stick to the plan she has constructed for them (something that her counterparts, including John Boehner and Paul D. Ryan, failed at repeatedly).\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly what that plan is, but the biggest challenge will be finding room on the calendar to conduct all the probes Democrats have lined up. There\u2019s the strong documentary evidence that the president and his family undertook a years-long conspiracy to commit tax fraud on a massive scale, and the administration\u2019s attempt to rig the census and its repeated lies about it, and the possibility that the president intervened in the decision on where to locate the new FBI headquarters to avoid competition for his hotel, to name just a few of the dozens of matters that cry out for investigation. There are things we can\u2019t yet anticipate, like whatever will be revealed once we\u2019re finally able to see President Trump\u2019s tax returns. (If you think they won\u2019t contain evidence of a pile of misdeeds, I\u2019ve got a degree from Trump University to sell you.) And, oh yeah, that Russia thing.\n\nAnd, of course, there are a raft of policy decisions ranging from the questionable to the horrific that administration officials need to answer questions about, whether it\u2019s the sabotaging of the Affordable Care Act or the separation of children from their parents at the border.\n\nWhen Republicans inevitably begin whining that Democrats are being too aggressive in all this oversight, remember how they be-clowned themselves through the Obama years, trying to gin up one phony scandal after another, including mounting seven, yes, seven separate investigations of Benghazi. We can and should have vigorous debates about what is being uncovered, how to understand it and what should be done about it. But the last thing we should do is waste our time arguing about whether there are too many investigations.\n\nSo, yes, it\u2019s all political \u2014 just like everything else Congress does. But that doesn\u2019t make it any less legitimate, especially given how Republicans have utterly abandoned their oversight responsibilities for the past two years.\n\nIf the Trump administration is a bastion of integrity and public-spiritedness, that\u2019s what the investigations will reveal. And if the president himself has displayed nothing but the highest ethical standards and respect for law throughout his career, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll learn. The sense of dread spreading over the White House and the Republican Party right now isn\u2019t because they think House Democrats will waste everyone\u2019s time with these investigations; it\u2019s because they know there\u2019s so much misbehavior to be uncovered. The public deserves to see and understand all of it, and if that winds up hurting Republicans, they have only themselves to blame.\n\nRead more:\n\nE.J.

Most of them were found inside burned-out homes in and around the town of Paradise or in cars that were overwhelmed by fire as locals desperately tried to outrun the fast-moving flames. The sheriff said 228 people are still unaccounted for, but many of them are probably in shelters.\n\nStill, the death toll is likely to climb.

High temperatures and gusty winds made the weather optimal for the fire to spread for at least another day.

(Feline Lim/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWhen world leaders gather in this city-state and Papua New Guinea for regional summits this week, there will be a conspicuous absence: President Trump.\n\nIt is summit season in Asia, with Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meetings due to start Tuesday in Singapore. The 10-member bloc hosts world leaders at the yearly East Asia Summit, a chance for regional leaders to strengthen ties with global powers. Most will then travel to Papua New Guinea for \u00adAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings, hosted this year by the poorest member of a 21-country bloc of Pacific economies.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin will be visiting Singapore for the first time, meeting leaders in a region that is increasingly looking to Moscow for arms purchases and diplomatic protection. Chinese President Xi Jinping will be in Port Moresby for the APEC summit over the weekend, underscoring Beijing\u2019s strategic play in the South Pacific, and will be deploying Chinese Premier Li Keqiang to Singapore to expand a free-trade agreement with the city-state and \u201cupgrade its relationship\u201d with Southeast Asian countries.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea will also be at the regional summits.\n\nTrump, however, is skipping them entirely, leaving Vice President Pence and national security adviser John Bolton to lead the U.S. delegation. Analysts view Trump\u2019s absence as a lost opportunity and miscalculation at a time when Washington and Beijing are locked in a battle for influence over a region that is China\u2019s backyard.\n\nThe U.S. president\u2019s decision not to show up is a \u201cmajor problem with really bad optics,\u201d said Brian Harding, deputy director of the Southeast Asia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n\u201cEvery country in Southeast Asia is trying to forge a close relationship with the U.S. \u2014 they don\u2019t want to live in a region that\u2019s dominated by China. They want options, and they want balance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t send a good signal [of U.S. commitment] that the president doesn\u2019t want to attend the one summit he\u2019s supposed to in Southeast Asia.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama, was the first U.S. president to attend the ASEAN-hosted East Asia Summit, in 2011, and made the trip every year of his presidency thereafter except during a government shutdown in 2013. The appearances were part of a broader pivot to Asia, a region where Obama believed the United States could forge deeper ties and find new allies.\n\nLast year, Trump was in Manila for meetings related to the regional bloc, but he left early and missed the summit itself.\n\n[A more assertive Beijing raises new questions for U.S.-China relations]\n\nU.S. officials insist that Trump\u2019s absence does not signal a lack of focus on the region. Writing in The Washington Post on Friday ahead of his trip, Pence said the U.S. commitment to the Indo-Pacific was \u201csteadfast and enduring,\u201d and he accused some nations of undermining a \u201cfoundation\u201d of sovereignty and free commercial trade flows in the region \u2014 a thinly veiled reference to China, which has been pushing sovereignty claims for years and expanding its military presence in the South China Sea.\n\nBeijing also sees Southeast Asia as front and center of its Belt and Road Initiative, a trillion-dollar-plus global investment plan that countries have begun to see as a debt trap that will leave them under China\u2019s thumb.\n\nIn a statement, the vice president\u2019s press secretary, Alyssa Farah, said Pence is \u201chonored to represent President Donald Trump\u201d and the summits and will \u201chighlight American leadership in the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will also deliver the message that authoritarianism, aggression, and the disregard for other nations\u2019 sovereignty by any nation in the Indo-Pacific will not be tolerated by the United States,\u201d she added.\n\nOn a trip to Europe in recent days, Trump drew criticism for failing to show up for a scheduled tour of an American military cemetery, citing the weather. Analysts widely perceived the trip as evidence of how isolated the United States under Trump has become from traditional European allies.\n\nSoutheast Asia, however, is a region where leaders have not taken particular offense to Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d rhetoric, especially as many countries have moved closer toward authoritarian rule under strongman leaders. Countries here continue to clamor for greater U.S. involvement and leadership and want an alternative to China\u2019s billion-dollar investment promises that Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, an ASEAN elder statesman, recently criticized as a \u201cnew version of co\u00adlo\u00adni\u00adal\u00adism.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s stock in Southeast Asia is not as low as some might imagine,\u201d said the CSIS\u2019s Harding.\n\nThe Trump administration recently announced a plan to support U.S.-style infrastructure development in the region, led by the private sector but backed by billions in development financing. Analysts say the plan needs to be fleshed out further, especially when Beijing is readying billion-dollar infrastructure projects such as a massive economic corridor in Myanmar and railways in the Philippines, a traditional U.S. ally.\n\nSoutheast Asian countries \u2014 which together hold almost 10 percent of the world\u2019s population, wedged between more-powerful neighbors such as India, China, South Korea and Japan \u2014 have always felt vulnerable about their geography and are likely to welcome the competition for influence if it means investments from both the United States and China.\n\nBut Dino Patti Djalal, a former Indonesian ambassador to Washington, said regional leaders are warning against a \u201czero-sum geopolitical rivalry\u201d between the two powers and do not want to be forced to make a choice between the two.\n\n\u201cThere is strong appetite for economic brinkmanship from Washington,\u201d he said, noting that the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cdiplomatic and political capital\u201d is \u201cdeclining\u201d in the region. \u201cI think we are seeing greater polarization ahead.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nXi tells the world China will boost imports, swiping at Trump\u2019s \u2018law of the jungle\u2019\n\nPompeo\u2019s meeting with North Korean counterpart called off at last minute\n\nU.S., North Korean diplomats trade handshakes and jabs at ASEAN conference\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "\n\nFrom left, Morocco\u2019s Prince Moulay Hassan, Moroccan King Mohammed VI, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Niger\u2019s president\u2019s wife Lalla Malika Issoufou, Niger\u2019s President Mahamadou Issoufou and Republic of Guinea\u2019s President Alpha Conde walk toward the Arc de Triomphe, in Paris, on Nov. 11.

Both are working their second year with the seasonal Amazon CamperForce as they travel back and forth between Vermont and Florida. (William DeShazer for The Washington Post)\n\nWhen Robert and Jessica Meinhofer told friends they were moving into an RV in 2015, most thought they were crazy.\n\nThe questions poured in: How could they go from living in a 2,000-square-foot home to living in a 250-square-foot trailer? What would they do with their stuff? What would their children, ages 6 and 9, do for school? Was this a midlife crisis? The hardest people to convince were Jessica\u2019s parents, who grew up in an impoverished Latino neighborhood in the Bronx and worked hard so their daughter could have a better life. They couldn\u2019t understand why the couple wanted to live like migrant laborers.\n\nThe Meinhofers are doing this by choice, not financial desperation. They are part of a movement of people ditching \u201csticks and bricks\u201d homes that have long embodied the American Dream and embracing a life of travel, minimal belongings and working when they want.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a family of four redefining what the American Dream means. It\u2019s happiness, not a four-bedroom house with a two-car garage,\u201d said Robert Meinhofer, who is 45.\n\nThe Meinhofers and a dozen others who spoke with The Washington Post about this modern nomadic lifestyle said living in 200 to 400 square feet has improved their marriages and made them happier, even if they\u2019re earning less. There\u2019s no official term for this lifestyle, but most refer to themselves as \u201cfull-time RVers,\u201d \u201cdigital nomads\u201d or \u201cworkampers.\u201d\n\n[America has a massive truck driver shortage. Here\u2019s why few want an $80,000 job.]\n\nMost modern nomads need jobs to fund their travels. Jessica Meinhofer works remotely as a government contractor, simply logging in from the RV. Others pick up \u201cgig work\u201d cleaning campsites, harvesting on farms or in vineyards, or filling in as security guards. People learn about gigs by word of mouth, on Workamper News or Facebook groups like one for Workampers with more than 30,000 members. Big companies such as Amazon and J.C. Penney even have programs specifically recruiting RVers to help at warehouses during the peak holiday season.\n\nA million Americans live full-time in RVs, according to the RV Industry Association. Some have to do it because they can\u2019t afford other options, but many do it by choice. Last year was a record for RV sales, according to the data firm Statistical Surveys. More than 10.5 million households own at least one RV, a jump from 2005 when 7.5 million households had RVs, according to RVIA.\n\nInterest in \u201cRVing\u201d \u2014 either full time or on weekends \u2014 appears to be picking up, especially among young couples. Half of new sales are going to Americans under 45, and purchases by people of color are rising, RVIA found in its 2016 surveys, a change from the 20th century, when white retirees dominated campsites.\n\nBelow, four families \u2014 with members ranging in age from 2 to 84 \u2014 share their experience of life on the road.\n\n\n\nPenni Brink, left, and Chip Litchfield pose for a portrait outside of their RV at the I-24 Campground in Smyrna, Tenn., on Sept. 20.

(William DeShazer for The Washington Post)\n\nPenni Brink (62) and Chip Litchfield (59) have a \u201cWelcome to Margaritaville\u201d sign outside their RV and the kind of easygoing spirit that immediately draws you in. The couple met in the late 1980s when they were working in the same business complex in Vermont, but Chip was married to someone else at the time. Their paths crossed again a few years ago at a craft fair and as their relationship blossomed, Chip suggested they travel in an RV. Penni was apprehensive at first.\n\nCurrent location: Tennessee.\n\nVehicle: 2004 Tiffin Phaeton (They bought it used for $67,000).\n\n\u201cI made it clear I needed a big fridge in the RV because I like to cook,\u201d Penni said. \u201cAnd I needed more than a tiny little bathroom.\u201d\n\nChip took Penni to a used RV lot just to \u201ccheck it out\u201d in 2015, but they ended up buying a 395-square foot camper they call \u201cDaisy.\u201d They say they love this lifestyle now and have no plans to return to a typical home. Penni is selling her condo in Montpelier because they don\u2019t think they\u2019ll need it anymore. They track how many states they have been to on a map on the side of their RV. The current tally is 25.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to be able to travel and work at the places we travel to so we can stay in areas long enough to get to know a place and see America,\u201d Chip said. \u201cThere is so much work out there for us, and we don\u2019t have to make a lot of money.\u201d\n\nPenni hung a \u201cless is more\u201d sign in the RV and has become an expert at cooking on a stove top that\u2019s about a third the size of a typical range. She used to run a small business in Vermont making drapes, blinds and other home decor and still does some work for clients in the RV. She sets up a folding card table for her sewing machine and sends Chip outside to clean the vehicle so she can have more space.\n\nAs they travel, they often pick up jobs to earn money since they don\u2019t want to tap their modest retirement savings, which they dipped into to buy the RV. Right now, they are working in the Amazon CamperForce program that hires about 700 people for warehouse jobs and pays their campsite fees. It\u2019s hard labor \u2014 they often go to bed rubbing each other\u2019s feet \u2014 but the money they earn from September to Dec. 23 is enough to allow them to take the winter and spring off. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\n\u201cBeing able to travel in my 60s and see all the things I missed in my younger years is the best part of this lifestyle,\u201d Penni said.\n\n\n\nRobert and Jessica Meinhofer and their two children in front of the RV.

They watched a YouTube video of a family that traveled the country in an RV and thought, why not us?\n\n\u201cWe both had full-time jobs. We were doing the 9 to 5 grind. We had the house, but it just didn\u2019t fit us quite right. We were just working, working working,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cWe were longing for freedom.\u201d\n\nWhen Robert was offered a job in Atlanta working for an airline, they didn\u2019t think they had enough money to buy a \u201cproper house\u201d for their two kids, their dog and their cats. So they decided to take the plunge on the RV lifestyle. Jessica convinced her company to let her work remotely so she could home-school their children and work in the RV anywhere in America. Robert works four days at the airline and then gets four days off, which he spends with his family in the RV.\n\nJessica warns it\u2019s not all fun on the road. \u201cInstead of mowing the lawn, we do maintenance on the RV. Things don\u2019t last as long as they do in a house. The level of chores is about the same,\u201d she said, adding that they have to go to the laundromat now. \u201cBut it gives us the freedom to be by the beach one day, a mountain the next or a lake. It\u2019s made all the difference for us.\u201d\n\nThe Meinhofers have met a lot of families with kids on the road, but they haven\u2019t encountered many other Latinos. They think there\u2019s a perception in some communities of color that doing this means you are destitute. They are trying to inspire others to join them with their YouTube channel, Exploring the Local Life, which has become so popular it is making them money.\n\n\n\nJoyce Ann Seid, left, poses for a portrait with her husband, Steve, 77, outside of their RV at the I-24 Campground in Smyrna.

Steven gutted the little room in the RV that had a bunk bed and turned it into an office for Joyce that even has a sliding door. Together they remodeled much of the interior, adding sunflowers, a reminder of Joyce\u2019s home state of Kansas, and their RV has a washer and dryer.\n\nThey mostly live off their retirement money, but they pick up various jobs to help pay for vehicle insurance and RV repairs. Steven worked several years in the Amazon CamperForce program, priding himself on being one of the oldest in the warehouse.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re old people, but we hate being retired.

Later the kids, ranging from 2 to 10, went to the campsite pool and quickly made friends with other families.\n\nThe Boohers wanted to show their kids more of America and get closer as a family. Accumulating stuff stopped mattering to them. Instead, they wanted to accumulate experiences. Miranda teaches the kids and is a coach for a Christian organization called Mothers of Preschoolers (MOPS) that helps bring moms of young children together for support and fellowship.

The earlier position was contained in the government\u2019s first physical activity guidelines, issued in 2008.\n\nThe document released Monday at the American Heart Association\u2019s 2018 Scientific Sessions is the first update since then.

Whatever you do, it really all counts,\u201d Brett P. Giroir, assistant secretary for health at HHS, said in an interview.\n\nThomas Allison, director of sports and exercise cardiology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said short bouts of exercise are valuable to break up long stretches of sitting. But research shows that multiple short sessions should involve similar energy expenditure to have the same impact as one longer session, or additional time moving will be needed, he said.\n\nAllison endorsed the overall intent of the new recommendations, which encourage movement of any kind, for any duration, in a country where about 80 percent of the population is not getting the minimum amount of recommended physical activity. He suggested that deskbound workers and other sedentary people get up and move about two minutes every half-hour.\n\nThe government\u2019s concern over American fitness is not new. President Teddy Roosevelt challenged Marines in 1908 to show that they could march 50 miles in 20 hours, and President-elect John F. Kennedy voiced his concerns about a nation going soft in an article he wrote for Sports Illustrated magazine in 1960.\n\nFor adults to stay healthy, the new guidelines call for 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity each week, along with at least two days a week of muscle-strengthening exercises. Those recommendations are unchanged from a decade ago.\n\nThe guidelines cite walking briskly at 2.5 to 4 miles per hour, playing volleyball or raking leaves as moderate-intensity activity. Vigorous-intensity exercise includes jogging or running, carrying heavy groceries or taking a strenuous fitness class, the panel said. Some workouts, such as swimming and cycling, can fall into either category, depending on the effort expended.\n\nChildren and teens ages 6 to 17 should get 60 minutes of vigorous activity every day, plus three days a week of activity that strengthens muscles, according to the recommendations. Older adults should do exercise to improve balance as well as cardio and muscle-strengthening workouts, the panel said.\n\nFor the first time, the guidelines include a recommendation for preschoolers, noting that children ages 3 to 5 \u201cshould be physically active throughout the day to enhance growth and development.\u201d The document also contains specific advice for pregnant and postpartum women and people with disabilities.\n\nThe panel noted that in the decade since the first guidelines were issued, research has expanded the recognized benefits of movement. These include reducing the risk of cancer, anxiety and depression; improving cognitive function and sleep; aiding bone health and regulating weight gain in preschoolers; protecting against weight gain, gestational diabetes and postpartum depression in pregnant women and new mothers; and decreasing the risk of falls among older people. Even a single workout can have some impact in some areas, the committee noted.\n\nResearchers have also learned more in recent years about how damaging a sedentary lifestyle can be.

(Stephen Wandera, File/Associated Press)\n\nKIGALI, Rwanda \u2014 More women and girls in poor countries are using modern contraception, signifying progress in efforts to involve women in family planning, according to a report released Monday.\n\nThe number of women and girls using contraceptives in 69 of the world\u2019s poorest countries surpassed 317 million in 2018, representing 46 million more users than in 2012, said the report by Family Planning 2020, a U.N.-backed global advocacy group working to promote rights-based family planning.\n\nAccess to modern contraception helped prevent over 119 million unintended pregnancies and averted 20 million unsafe abortions between July 2017 and July 2018, although populations continue to soar across Africa and other low income countries, the report said.\n\n\u201cThe best way to overcome this challenge of rapid population growth is by giving women and girls (the) opportunity to decide how many children they want to have,\u201d Beth Schlachter, executive director of Family Planning 2020, told The Associated Press.\n\nThe mix of contraceptive methods has improved significantly in 20 of the surveyed countries, \u201cmeaning that more women are able to find the short-term, long-acting, emergency, or permanent method that suits their needs and preferences,\u201d the report said.\n\nBut even as millions of poor women use contraceptives, millions more who want to delay or prevent pregnancy are still unable to access it, often due to lack of information, the report said, citing perceived health side-effects and social disapproval as deterrents.\n\nUnder Family Planning 2020, which grew out of a summit on family planning held in London in 2012, donors have pledged millions of dollars to bring contraception to 120 million more women and girls in developing countries by the year 2020.\n\nMany of the 69 countries surveyed for the report are in sub-Saharan Africa, which is witnessing a population boom even as other parts of the world see dropping birth rates. Over half of the global population growth between now and 2050 will take place in Africa, according to U.N. figures.\n\nAccording to the new report, contraceptive use is growing fastest in Africa, even though the region\u2019s fertility rates remain high.\n\nThe most recent U.N. global population report estimates Africa\u2019s fertility rate to be 5.1 births per woman.\n\nBecause the region\u2019s growing population is not backed by substantial rises in family incomes and the development of public infrastructure, there are concerns that a population boom may deepen poverty levels for many Africans.\n\nOver the years, family planning has often been difficult to sell in heavily paternalistic sub-Saharan Africa, with the matter becoming controversial as some African leaders challenge the view that a growing population is bad for the world\u2019s poorest continent.\n\nUgandan President Yoweri Museveni insists Africa needs more people, and has lambasted what he calls \u201cthe shrill cries of NGOs about population control.\u201d\n\nIn February President John Magufuli of Tanzania encouraged polygamy, citing the 10 million more women than men in his country in advising men to marry \u201ctwo or more wives\u201d to reduce the number of single women.\n\n___\n\nMuhumuza reported from Kampala, Uganda.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Aaron Marineau/The Hutchinson News via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nCHICAGO \u2014 Move more, sit less and get kids active as young as age 3, say new federal guidelines that stress that any amount and any type of exercise helps health.\n\nThe advice is the first update since the government\u2019s physical activity guidelines came out a decade ago. Since then, the list of benefits of exercise has grown, and there\u2019s more evidence to back things that were of unknown value before, such as short, high-intense workouts and taking the stairs instead of an elevator.\n\n\u201cDoing something is better than doing nothing, and doing more is better than doing something,\u201d said Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones, a preventive medicine expert at Northwestern University in Chicago.\n\nOnly 20 percent of Americans get enough exercise now, and the childhood obesity problem has prompted the push to aim younger to prevent poor health later in life.\n\nHighlights of the advice released Monday at an American Heart Association conference in Chicago and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association:\n\nCHILDREN AND TEENS\n\nThe biggest change: Start young. Guidelines used to begin at age 6, but the new ones say preschoolers ages 3 through 5 should be encouraged to take part in active play throughout the day. They don\u2019t call for a certain amount but say a reasonable target may be three hours of various intensities. That\u2019s consistent with guidelines in many other countries and is the average amount of activity observed in kids this age.\n\nFrom ages 6 through 17, at least an hour of moderate-to-vigorous activity throughout the day is recommended. Most of it should be aerobic, the kind that gets the heart rate up such as brisk walking, biking or running. At least three times a week, exercise should be vigorous and include muscle- and bone-strengthening activities like climbing on playground equipment or playing sports.\n\nADULTS\n\nDuration stays the same \u2014 at least 2\u00bd to 5 hours of moderate-intensity or 1 \u00bc to 2 \u00bd hours of vigorous activity a week, plus at least two days that include muscle-strengthening exercise like pushups or lifting weights.\n\nOne key change: It used to be thought that aerobic activity had to be done for at least 10 minutes. Now even short times are known to help. Even a single episode of activity gives short-term benefits such as lowering blood pressure, reducing anxiety and improving sleep.\n\nSitting a lot is especially harmful.\n\nThe advice is similar for older adults, but activities should include things that promote balance to help avoid falls.\n\nBROUGHT TO YOU BY THE LETTER E\n\nTargeting young children is the goal of a project that Dr. Valentin Fuster, a cardiologist at New York\u2019s Mount Sinai Hospital, has worked on for years with the Heart Association and Sesame Workshop, producers of television\u2019s \u201cSesame Street.\u201d\n\nAt the heart conference, he gave results of an intensive four-month program to improve knowledge and attitudes about exercise and health among 562 kids ages 3 to 5 in Head Start preschools in Harlem.\n\n\u201cIt was really successful,\u201d Fuster said. \u201cOnce they understand how the body works, they begin to understand physical activity\u201d and its importance.\n\nWhen brains are young, \u201cit\u2019s the best opportunity\u201d to set health habits that last, he said.\n\n___\n\nMarilynn Marchione can be followed at @MMarchioneAP\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

(Fred Zwicky/Peoria Journal Star/AP)\n\nWhile Congress and the Trump administration were promoting greater use of the addiction medication buprenorphine to quell the opioid epidemic, a handful of states were licensing new methadone clinics in dozens of the nation\u2019s hardest-hit communities.\n\nThe methadone treatment industry, which began in the late 1960s, grew more in the past four years than it has in the past two decades, said Mark Parrino, president of the American Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence, which represents methadone treatment providers.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2018, the methadone industry added 254 new clinics, according to data from the Drug Enforcement Administration. In the two decades before that, increases in the number of programs were only incremental, Parrino said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen such a dramatic increase in the industry since the 1970s.\u201d\n\nDespite a national drumbeat for more science-based treatment for people addicted to prescription painkillers, heroin and other illicit opioids, the expansion of methadone clinics has mostly gone unheralded.\n\nUnlike buprenorphine, which can be prescribed by specially licensed practitioners and taken orally at home, or injectable Vivitrol, which can be administered by any doctor, methadone must be doled out daily at highly regulated and often very visible clinics.\n\nCrowded parking lots, long lines and the potential for diversion of the medication have led many states to limit the number of clinics they license.\n\nSome politicians and many in the general public have likened methadone treatment to trading one addiction for another. And certain politicians \u2014 including former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican, and former Vermont governor and Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean \u2014 have criticized use of the medication.\n\nThat\u2019s starting to change.\n\n\u201cThere has been an underlying stigma against methadone for so many years that the industry naturally maintains a low profile,\u201d said Yngvild Olsen, an addiction doctor in Baltimore and board member of the American Society of Addiction Medicine. \u201cEven now,\u201d she said, \u201caccess to methadone is highly geographic. It depends on where you live.\u201d\n\nIn an opioid epidemic that is killing more than 130 Americans every day, more states, including some that previously limited expansion of methadone treatment, are calling on the industry to set up new programs in opioid-plagued rural and suburban areas that lack adequate medication-assisted treatment options.\n\nAnd opioid treatment companies are responding, with most new clinics offering all three opioid addiction medications, which have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. A major driver of the recent expansion is millions in newly available Medicaid reimbursement dollars for methadone treatment in at least 37 states and the District.\n\nAmong the most aggressive states in seeking methadone treatment expansion have been Indiana, Maryland and New York, which have strategically located dozens of new facilities in rural and suburban communities in the past two years. Ohio and Florida are planning major expansions this year and next.\n\nAt the same time, laws and regulations in at least six other states \u2014 Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, West Virginia and Wyoming \u2014 still curtail licensing of new methadone clinics, even though people with opioid addictions in large swaths of those states live too far from the nearest methadone clinic to commute.\n\nReimbursement for methadone treatment started becoming available in the past four years in many of the 33 states and the District where Medicaid has been expanded under the Affordable Care Act to cover low-income adults. As a result, the opioid treatment industry has the financial incentive to invest in new facilities.\n\nIn January 2020, Medicare coverage of methadone treatment for people 65 and older is scheduled to begin under the recently enacted Opioid Crisis Response Act, further boosting potential revenue for opioid treatment providers.\n\nMethadone and buprenorphine are opioids that when taken orally eliminate withdrawal symptoms and drug cravings without producing euphoria in people who quit prescription painkillers or heroin.\n\nVivitrol, a 30-day injection, blocks the effects of opioids and alcohol and is not a narcotic. With less research on its outcomes, the relatively new drug is considered effective for only certain people.\n\nThe American Society of Addiction Medicine advises that all three medications be considered for any patients seeking treatment for an opioid addiction to determine which medicine will work best.\n\nFor many, only methadone will sufficiently quiet drug cravings, particularly those who have used high doses of heroin for many years and those who have used the more potent synthetic opioid fentanyl. For others, buprenorphine or Vivitrol may be the best choice.\n\nTo open a methadone clinic, companies and nonprofit groups must apply for a state license after demonstrating a need for the service. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely up to states to determine whether they have sufficient opioid treatment capacity,\u201d Parrino said.\n\nMost of the clinics were established with public money starting in the 1970s when an earlier heroin epidemic ravaged major urban centers. Others were added in the past two decades, particularly in smaller towns, as the opioid epidemic took hold in rural and suburban communities.\n\nOnce a state issues a license and a facility\u2019s location is approved under local zoning ordinances, companies must seek federal approval from the DEA and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and follow strict rules.\n\nFor example, methadone is typically provided through a plexiglass shield and kept overnight in locked containers. And patients are routinely screened to ensure they are taking the medication and not combining it with other dangerous drugs.\n\nMost methadone patients visit a clinic daily to take their medication while a professional observes them. They also are encouraged to attend individual and group psychosocial counseling sessions. Once stabilized, some patients can take home-weekend doses, often graduating to weekly and monthly take-home dosing.\n\nAs of October, 1,611 methadone treatment programs were operating in 49 states and the District, serving more than 380,000 patients, SAMHSA data shows. And that number is projected to grow over the next two years.\n\nBuprenorphine, which was developed with federal funding and approved by the FDA in 2002, can be prescribed by doctors, nurse practitioners and physician assistants for 30 days at a time, picked up at a drugstore and taken at home. Similar to those taking methadone, patients who take buprenorphine are encouraged to attend individual and group counseling sessions.\n\nAlthough the federal government has spent millions of dollars to support greater prescribing of buprenorphine, particularly by primary-care physicians, the number of prescribers who have taken the required eight-hour DEA course, and the number of patients they are serving, has been much lower than expected.\n\nAbout 56,000 of the nation\u2019s more than a million physicians are licensed to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid addiction, but only 112,000 patients received the medication last year, according to SAMHSA.\n\nBuprenorphine is widely diverted and is sought after on the black market, particularly among active opioid users who sometimes want to abstain from the illicit drug and avoid withdrawal symptoms. Advocates for greater prescribing of the medication argue that most buprenorphine diversion is the result of the drug\u2019s limited access through legitimate means.\n\nUnlike methadone and buprenorphine, Vivitrol is not a narcotic and is not diverted. So far, 23,000 people are taking Vivitrol for an opioid addiction, according to SAMHSA. A long-acting injectable medication, Vivitrol was approved by the FDA in 2010 and can be prescribed and administered by any physician without obtaining a special license.\n\nResearch shows that individuals who receive addiction treatment with methadone, buprenorphine or Vivitrol are at least twice as likely to remain in treatment and achieve long-term recovery as those who receive addiction treatment without medication.\n\nDespite the scientific evidence, fewer than 1 in 10 people with an opioid addiction receive addiction treatment that includes those medications. About the same number of people receive addiction treatment without medications, often because none are available in their communities.\n\nAnd those who want to quit are often unable to find treatment in their community or cannot afford it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that better access to methadone maintenance would save lives,\u201d said Andrew Kolodny, who co-directs opioid treatment research at Brandeis University. \u201cBut for an addiction epidemic that is disproportionately rural and suburban, an intervention that relies on people visiting a clinic every day isn\u2019t the best option. Buprenorphine would be better, but it\u2019s not growing quickly enough.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Stateline\n\nVestal is a reporter for Stateline, an initiative of the Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nRead more\n\nFacing an overdose epidemic, some ERs now offer addiction treatment\n\nJails are slow to dispense meds that curb inmates\u2019 cravings\n\nSee how deadly street opioids have become", "New fitness guidelines call for 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity each week (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nAmericans seeking to stay healthy can get their exercise in small increments of just a few minutes at a time, according to new guidelines issued by the government Monday that again encourage a largely sedentary nation to start moving.\n\nThe guidance from a committee appointed by the Department of Health and Human Services does away with the official government position that physical activity should occur in sessions of at least 10 minutes.

Giroir, assistant secretary for health at HHS, said in an interview.\n\nThomas Allison, director of sports and exercise cardiology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said short bouts of exercise are valuable to break up long stretches of sitting. But research shows that multiple short sessions should involve similar energy expenditure to have the same impact as one longer session, or additional time moving will be needed, he said.\n\nAllison endorsed the overall intent of the new recommendations, which encourage movement of any kind, for any duration, in a country where about 80 percent of the population is not getting the minimum amount of recommended physical activity. He suggested that deskbound workers and other sedentary people get up and move about two minutes every half-hour.\n\nThe government\u2019s concern over American fitness is not new. President Teddy Roosevelt challenged Marines in 1908 to show that they could march 50 miles in 20 hours, and President-elect John F. Kennedy voiced his concerns about a nation going soft in an article he wrote for Sports Illustrated magazine in 1960.\n\nFor adults to stay healthy, the new guidelines call for 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity each week, along with at least two days a week of muscle-strengthening exercises. Those recommendations are unchanged from a decade ago.\n\nThe guidelines cite walking briskly at 2.5 to 4 miles per hour, playing volleyball or raking leaves as moderate-intensity activity. Vigorous-intensity exercise includes jogging or running, carrying heavy groceries or taking a strenuous fitness class, the panel said. Some workouts, such as swimming and cycling, can fall into either category, depending on the effort expended.\n\nChildren and teens ages 6 to 17 should get 60 minutes of vigorous activity every day, plus three days a week of activity that strengthens muscles, according to the recommendations. Older adults should do exercise to improve balance as well as cardio and muscle-strengthening workouts, the panel said.\n\nFor the first time, the guidelines include a recommendation for preschoolers, noting that children ages 3 to 5 \u201cshould be physically active throughout the day to enhance growth and development.\u201d The document also contains specific advice for pregnant and postpartum women and people with disabilities.\n\nThe panel noted that in the decade since the first guidelines were issued, research has expanded the recognized benefits of movement. These include reducing the risk of cancer, anxiety and depression; improving cognitive function and sleep; aiding bone health and regulating weight gain in preschoolers; protecting against weight gain, gestational diabetes and postpartum depression in pregnant women and new mothers; and decreasing the risk of falls among older people. Even a single workout can have some impact in some areas, the committee noted.\n\nResearchers have also learned more in recent years about how damaging a sedentary lifestyle can be. The report notes that \u201can estimated $117 billion in annual health care costs and about 10 percent of premature mortality are associated with inadequate physical activity.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing physically active,\u201d the guidelines state, \u201cis one of the most important actions individuals of all ages can engage in to improve their health.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nExercise improves your \u2018healthspan,\u2019 but it\u2019s not entirely clear why\n\nHitting the gym at 102\n\nGrowing body of evidence links physical activity and mental acuity", "\n\nAndreas Lust as Carsten Neuer in \"Gavagai,\" which is being screened at the Avalon this week.

Sri Lankan is in the midst of a political crisis set off by the president\u2019s decisions to remove the South Asian island nation\u2019s prime minister, dissolve Parliament and call snap elections. The moves have triggered public protests and international criticism, including from some of the country\u2019s biggest donors. (Eranga Jayawardena, file/Associated Press)\n\nNEW DELHI \u2014 Sri Lanka is in the midst of a political crisis set off by the president\u2019s decisions to remove the South Asian island nation\u2019s prime minister, dissolve Parliament and call snap elections.\n\nThe moves have triggered public protests and international criticism, including from some of the country\u2019s biggest donors.\n\nA look at the key players and moments in the ongoing saga:\n\n___\n\nA POLITICAL RIVALRY REIGNITES\n\nThe crisis centers around three main characters: President Maithripala Sirisena, ousted Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, and former strongman President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was recently appointed prime minister by Sirisena.\n\nSirisena and Wickremesinghe are ideological opponents who formed a coalition to defeat Rajapaksa in 2015 elections. Rajapaksa, who was president from 2005 to 2015, is considered a hero by some in Sri Lanka\u2019s ethnic Sinhalese majority because he oversaw the end of a 25-year civil war by crushing ethnic minority Tamil rebels in 2009.\n\nBut his time in power was marred by allegations of war-time atrocities, corruption and nepotism.\n\n___\n\nBUILDING TENSIONS\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister.\n\nWickremesinghe\u2019s government came under fire last year after handing over operations of a port to a Chinese company in a 99-year lease that the previous government had built in Rajapaksa\u2019s home district with Chinese loans. Rajapaksa described the deal to his left-leaning supporters as a bid by Wickremesinghe to privatize national assets. Wickremesinghe said in an interview with The Associated Press that the deal helped the country avoid defaulting on debts accumulated during Rajapaksa\u2019s presidency.\n\nSirisena has accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, a charge that Wickremesinghe has repeatedly denied and that so far has not led to any arrests.\n\n___\n\nA POWER PLAY\n\nOn Oct. 26, the alliance between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe formally fell apart, with Sirisena naming Rajapaksa the new prime minister and suspending Parliament.\n\nAfter a week of upheaval, Sirisena announced he was dissolving Parliament and calling snap elections due on Jan. 5. He later explained in a nationally televised address that he dissolved Parliament out of fear that lawmakers would come to blows over his Oct. 26 decision.\n\n___\n\nREFUSING TO STAND DOWN\n\nWickremesinghe has been holed up in the prime minister\u2019s official residence in Colombo \u2014 surrounded by a skeleton security crew, supporters and Buddhist monks \u2014 since he was ousted and maintains he is the country\u2019s rightful leader. He has repeatedly called for Parliament to be reconvened so that he could prove his majority support among the country\u2019s 225 lawmakers.\n\nHe alleges that the snap election was called only when it became clear that Rajapaksa had failed to lure enough lawmakers to his side with offers of cash and jobs and would lose any confidence vote in Parliament.\n\n___\n\nA CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION\n\nThere is debate over whether Sirisena\u2019s Oct. 26 move was legal.\n\nHe has cited a general clause in Sri Lanka\u2019s Constitution stating that the president has the power to summon or suspend Parliament.\n\nSupreme Court petitioners challenging Sirisena\u2019s actions argue that a specific clause in the 19th amendment, added in 2015, stipulates that Parliament can\u2019t be dissolved until 4 1/2 years after its election, unless 2/3 of Parliament requests it happen sooner. The current Parliament was elected in August 2015.\n\n___\n\nWHO\u2019S RUNNING SRI LANKA\n\nSirisena and Rajapaksa formed a Cabinet of party loyalists and government defectors within days of the Oct. 26 shakeup. They quickly cut fuel prices, a popular measure among those who blamed the Wickremesinghe-led government for Sri Lanka\u2019s sluggish economy.\n\n___\n\nTHE PUBLIC REACTS\n\nMembers of Wickremesinghe\u2019s political coalition, supporters and chanting Buddhist monks quickly set up camp in a hall at the prime minister\u2019s official residence after Sirisena withdrew most of Wickremesinghe\u2019s security personnel.\n\nFour days into the crisis, at least 10,000 people marched through central Colombo demanding that Sirisena summon Parliament.\n\nSirisena and Rajapaksa responded by organizing a massive rally on Nov. 5, with politicians from their party bringing busloads of constituents into Colombo. Police estimated at least 120,000 attended.\n\n___\n\nINTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATION\n\nThe U.S. has said that Sirisena\u2019s decision to dissolve Parliament \u201cposes a vital threat to Sri Lanka\u2019s democratic institutions.\u201d Colombo-based diplomats from Australia, the U.K. and the European Union also issued statements calling for the country\u2019s constitution and democracy to be respected.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has offered to moderate discussions between Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe. On Sunday, he urged the government to respect \u201cdemocratic processes and institutions.\u201d\n\nChina and India have been careful not to take an overt position in Sri Lanka, which has been a battleground in their struggle for geopolitical supremacy in South Asia.\n\n___\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n\nPetitioners asked the Supreme Court on Monday to declare Sirisena\u2019s decrees null and void. That decision could come as early as Tuesday.\n\nBoth Rajapaksa and Sirisena have said they will face the Jan. 5 election together.\n\nSirisena suggested on Sunday that he could have Wickremesinghe forcibly removed from the prime minister\u2019s residence.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Many of the heads of state in attendance \u2014 from U.S. President Donald Trump to President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of Turkey \u2014 have advanced nationalist agendas that are testing the foundations of international cooperation. In an address to the leaders, Mr. Macron recalled the millions who died in World War I and defended multilateral institutions like the United Nations and the European Union that have been a target of criticism from Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nRep.

She says that\u2019s about protecting the integrity of the country, not letting impeachment become just another politicized process\u2014but it\u2019s also a deliberate poison pill that would almost stop impeachment from ever happening. She knows what it would take for Republicans to come along. She wants the bar set that high.\u201d She\u2019s exactly right.\n\nRemember the Republicans who sought to undermine democracy. \u201cTapper Grills Cory Gardner (But Not Chuck Schumer) Over Florida Vote: \u2018Any Specific Evidence at All\u2019 of Fraud, Theft?\u201d\n\nPeople will remember Trump\u2019s absurd, inappropriate threats while Americans were suffering, not to mention his climate change denial. \u201cA town named Paradise has been reduced to ash.

Mr. Whitaker needs to understand that he will be called to answer. And any role that he plays will be exposed to the public. We don\u2019t want there to be any ambiguity about that.\u201d\n\nI cannot remember any other president who would dream of behaving this way. \u201cMore than 60 world leaders gathered in Paris Sunday to mark 100 years since the end of World War I, and although the general theme was unity, President Donald Trump seemed determined to stand apart.

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nA look at the good (Hail!) and bad (Fail!) from the Redskins' 16-3 win over the Buccaneers on Sunday at Raymond James Stadium.\n\nHail: No Lead Changes\n\nThis is my favorite quirky NFL stat. Buccaneers kicker Chandler Catanzaro must appreciate it, too. Entering Sunday, Washington was the fourth team since 1970 without a lead change in its first eight games, and the first since the 1995 Packers. In improving to 6-0 when scoring first this season, Washington became the first team not to experience a lead change in its first nine games since the 1954 Redskins. That team started 0-5 and finished 3-9 under Coach Joe Kuharich.\n\nGet this.\n\n\n\nThe @Redskins have now played 9 games without a single lead change.\n\n\n\nThey are the first team with no lead changes through 9 games since the 1954 \u2026 Redskins! #WASvsTB \u2014 NFL Research (@NFLResearch) November 11, 2018\n\nWashington\u2019s strange streak appeared to be in jeopardy against the Buccaneers, as the opening score of the game was a field goal, not a touchdown, for the first time in a game involving the Redskins this season. After Dustin Hopkins gave Washington a 3-0 lead, the Redskins forced Tampa Bay to settle for a potential game-tying field goal, but Catanzaro missed a chip shot from 30 yards. Catanzaro missed again with Washington leading 6-3, and the Redskins maintained their three-point advantage until Josh Doctson\u2019s touchdown catch early in the fourth quarter.\n\nFail: The Buccaneers' Yards-to-Points Ratio\n\nOkay, I lied, this is my favorite quirky NFL stat. According to Pro Football Reference, the Buccaneers, who had 29 first downs and punted once, became the first NFL team dating back to 1940 to amass at least 500 total yards and score fewer than six points. On Nov. 17, 1986, the 49ers outgained the Redskins, 501-266, in a 14-6 loss at RFK Stadium, the previous low point total for a team that eclipsed 500 yards. San Francisco committed four turnovers in that game, including three interceptions by Joe Montana. Washington won despite quarterback Jay Schroeder completing only 17 of 40 passes for 170 yards and throwing two interceptions of his own.\n\nThe Buccaneers joined the 2011 St. Louis Rams as the only teams since 1940 to be limited to three points or fewer when managing at least 400 yards. How did Tampa Bay pull it off? With red zone futility rarely seen outside of the Pee-Wee football ranks. The Buccaneers made five trips inside Washington\u2019s 20-yard line. Two of those trips ended with turnovers. Two more culminated with missed field goals.\n\n\u201cBetter teams, we gotta figure out a way to stop guys from getting up the field, but the ultimate goal is to keep them out of the end zone, and we did that,\u201d Redskins safety D.J. Swearinger said.\n\n[These Redskins have a winning strategy: Keep it simple and let the other team lose]\n\nHail: Turnovers\n\nThe Buccaneers entered the game with the second-most giveaways (21) in the league. They lived up to their reputation as generous hosts with four more turnovers Sunday.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much what we knew we had to do,\u201d Redskins cornerback Josh Norman told NBC Sports Washington\u2019s JP Finlay after the win. \u201cWe had to go out here and give the ball back to our offense as many times as we can, just because we know we\u2019re a little shorthanded on offense right now. With the banged up guys and the injuries that took place, we know we gotta put it on our back, each and every week we gotta come out and take over a game.\u201d\n\nNorman got Washington\u2019s turnover party started with a leaping interception at the goal line to end Tampa Bay\u2019s first drive. The takeaway extended the Redskins\u2019 NFL-best streak of games with at least one turnover to 13. Preston Smith\u2019s strip-sack of Ryan Fitzpatrick and Ryan Kerrigan\u2019s ensuing fumble recovery with less than four minutes remaining was Washington\u2019s third takeaway in the fourth quarter and helped seal an ugly win.\n\n\u201cThese games are very, very close, and it comes down to a turnover here or there, or a key penalty, so I think the turnover battle is critical,\u201d Redskins Coach Jay Gruden said after Washington improved its turnover differential to plus-11 this season. \u201cIt\u2019s what we\u2019ve been preaching. Hats off to our quarterback and our receivers and our ballcarriers for great ball security, and our defense for getting the ball. It\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s been the difference so far, and it\u2019s why we are where we are.\u201d\n\nFail: Ripping Redskins Fans\n\nAfter Washington improved to 3-1 on the road, Norman said his team fed off the energy of the Redskins fans who made the trip to Tampa Bay and voiced his disappointment with the crowds at FedEx Field this season.\n\n\u201cWe come back to our home and it seems like guys don\u2019t really care,\u201d Norman said. \u201cThey just boo everything and aren\u2019t really behind us. We don\u2019t really feel that [support]. And I\u2019m tired of it, really. [Shoot], we can play all the games on the road if you ask me. At the end of the day, the people who are going to be for you, the fans that really [have] your back, they\u2019ll be there. The other ones, man, it is what it is. Can\u2019t really speak on them. They\u2019re going to talk about what they talk about anyway. They\u2019re all keyboard warriors anyway.\u201d\n\nSorry, Josh. While the Texans surely wouldn\u2019t mind if next week\u2019s game were relocated to Houston, the NFL would probably frown upon such a move. Norman made some valid points during his postgame rant, but criticizing a fan base that has lived through 25 years of disappointment isn\u2019t productive. Just ask Robert Henson. Norman elaborated on his comments with a tweet in which he challenged fans to make FedEx Field \u201cterrifyingly loud\u201d and \u201cmenacing.\u201d\n\n6-3 1st NFC-EasT, 1st time in along time that in itself should be \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd We worked on our craft to get here.

Norman (@J_No24) November 12, 2018\n\nHail: Zach Brown\n\nThe Redskins linebacker was originally slated for a \u201cFail\u201d mention for his since-deleted tweet from Saturday night about his frustration with the coaching staff. Maybe the former North Carolina standout was in a bad mood because his alma mater lost its rivalry game to Duke. In any event, Brown channeled his anger on the field Sunday, finishing with nine tackles, including two for loss.\n\nFail: The Redskins\u2019 Offense\n\nYes, the Redskins have been decimated by injuries, particularly along the offensive line and in the receiving corps, but that doesn\u2019t excuse managing only 16 points and 286 total yards against the league\u2019s 29th-ranked defense. Tampa Bay was allowing 34 points per game and had limited one opponent to fewer than 400 yards this year before the Redskins came to town. Washington quarterback Alex Smith missed a sure touchdown on a deep throw to Vernon Davis, but improved to 3-0 this season \u2014 and 4-0 in his career \u2014 when he throws for exactly 178 yards. Weird.\n\nHail: Special Teams\n\nJust put Tress Way in the Pro Bowl now. The Redskins punter averaged 49.4 yards on five punts, including four that were downed inside the 20. Hopkins continued his solid season by drilling all three of his field goal attempts.\n\nFail: Timeout Management\n\nIt didn\u2019t come back to hurt the Redskins on Sunday, but Gruden called a timeout on the third play of the second half and burned his third and final timeout with nine minutes remaining in the game. Buccaneers Coach Dirk Koetter did Gruden one better when he threw his challenge flag to ask officials to take another look at a potential Adrian Peterson fumble just before the two-minute warning at the end of the game. Problem was, Koetter was out of timeouts and therefore couldn\u2019t challenge the play, resulting in a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty.\n\nRead more on the Redskins:\n\nRedskins-Buccaneers takeaways: Tampa Bay dominates the stat sheet, including turnovers committed\n\nRedskins earn ugly 16-3 win over the Buccaneers, remain in first place\n\nJosh Norman slams Redskins fans after road win: \u2018They just boo everything\u2019\n\nRedskins' win over Bucs didn\u2019t look pretty, but it passes the smell test\n\nRedskins have a much-needed (mostly) injury-free Sunday", "DHAKA,Bangladesh \u2014 Authorities in Bangladesh agreed Monday to delay national elections by a week because of opposition demands for more time to prepare.\n\nChief Election Commissioner K.M.

The alliance, called the National Oikya Front, consists of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and other parties.\n\nThe National Oikya Front, led by prominent lawyer Kamal Hossain, could pose a major challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina\u2019s desire to win a third consecutive term. Hossain was a close aide of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina\u2019s father, and now heads a small party, the Gono Forum.\n\nThe initial date for the election was announced last Thursday.\n\nHasina\u2019s five-year-term expires on Jan. 28.\n\nHuda said he was happy that all eligible political parties have agreed to join the elections. Initially it was unclear if Zia\u2019s party, which boycotted the last elections in 2014, would participate after she was jailed on corruption charges. But since it joined the new alliance, Zia\u2019s party has attempted to regain its position.\n\nOn Monday, five top opposition leaders met with Zia in a jail in Dhaka, and said she asked them to contest the polls.\n\n\u201cMadam offered prayers and expressed hope that we will move forward with our unity with the people,\u201d said Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, secretary-general of her party.\n\nHasina will head an election-time government as provided for in the constitution. The opposition has demanded an independent caretaker administration, saying the election could be rigged under Hasina, a charge she has denied.\n\nZia, 73, has been in jail since February, when she was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment for alleged corruption in the establishment of an orphanage fund during her first term as prime minister in 1991-1996. Following an appeal, the High Court extended her sentence to 10 years.\n\nIn a second case, a trial court last month sentenced Zia to seven years in jail on corruption charges linked to a charity fund named after her late husband.\n\nZia\u2019s party says both cases are politically motivated.\n\nZia faces more than 30 other cases pending in courts across the country.\n\nHer elder son, Tarique Rahman, the heir-apparent in a political culture of dynastic politics, has been in exile in London for years to avoid arrest. A court last month sentenced him in absentia to life in prison in a 2004 grenade attack case.\n\nThe Election Commission last month canceled the political registration of Jamaat-e-Islami, the main partner of Zia\u2019s party, which prevents it from participating in the election. Its leaders could contest with a different symbol under the new opposition alliance.\n\nThe court said Jamaat-e-Islami\u2019s registration violated election laws and the spirit of the constitution because the party had opposed the country\u2019s war of independence with Pakistan in 1971. The party is a fierce opponent of Hasina and is eager to regain its strength after the executions of its top leaders on charges of war crimes during the conflict.\n\nThe Dec. 30 polls would be Bangladesh\u2019s 11th general election since it gained independence in the war.\n\nBangladesh has been a parliamentary democracy since 1991 after an autocratic government led by former military chief H.M. Ershad was toppled by mass protests. Hasina and Zia have since ruled the country under a complex political culture in which violence has often marred the electoral process. Ershad\u2019s Jatiya Party is now a partner of Hasina\u2019s party.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Each has been declared the new \u201cleader of the free world\u201d since President Barack Obama\u2019s term ended. Both are in domestic trouble.\n\nAnd, according to one elderly lady, they could very well be a couple.\n\n\u201cMr. Macron, it\u2019s not possible, a little good woman like me to shake hands with the president of the Republic. It\u2019s fantastic,\u201d the 100-year-old woman told Macron on the sidelines of a World War I commemorative event on Saturday. The excited lady then turned to Merkel, arguably the world\u2019s most powerful woman.\n\n\u201cYou are Madame Macron,\u201d the smiling centenarian said to Merkel, 64, confusing her with Macron\u2019s wife, Brigitte Macron, who is 65, according to France\u2019s public broadcaster and Belgian television.\n\nWith an unmistakably German accent, an amused Merkel clarified twice in French: \u201cI am the German chancellor.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic,\u201d responded the diminutive woman, whose name was not reported by French news media. In video of the encounter in Rethondes, about 60 miles north of Paris, a relative is heard saying the woman would turn 101 on Monday.\n\nVideo of Merkel explaining to a 101 year old Frenchwoman that she is not Macron's wife but the chancellor of Germany https://t.co/7UDjnZDykn via @franceinfo \u2014 Mathieu von Rohr (@mathieuvonrohr) November 11, 2018\n\nUnder different circumstances, mistaking a female world leader for the wife of her male counterpart would be yet another example of the persistence of gender stereotypes. But reactions to Saturday\u2019s remarkable exchange were overwhelmingly positive. To a woman who was born toward the end of the first devastating world war and who was young when the Germans launched the second one, the Franco-German unity on display would have been completely unimaginable to her younger self.\n\nMore than 20 million people were killed during World War I. Only two decades later, 40 million more became victims of World War II in Europe, with half of them estimated to have been civilians. Postwar divisions impacted Franco-German relations early on, as more mass graves were discovered and trials uncovered the full horrors of Nazi occupation.\n\nBut during the second half of the 20th century, an understanding emerged between France and Germany that both nations were geographically and politically tied together. That sentiment later helped establish the European Union, a project originally designed to preserve peace in Europe but now a far more expansive economic and political endeavor.\n\n\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron welcomes German Chancellor Angela Merkel to the Elysee Palace in Paris ahead of Armistice Day ceremonies. (Etienne Laurent/EPA-EFE)\n\nAs that union is now under unprecedented pressure from both the inside and outside, Macron and Merkel are seen as its most powerful protectors. On Sunday, Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative for Germany party caused a stir when it suggested that Merkel should have refrained from attending the show of postwar unity in Paris over the weekend because Germany did not win the war. Meanwhile, approval ratings for Macron are dropping, as populists on the left and right gain new momentum.\n\nBut both Macron and Merkel have struggled to confront those challengers. Merkel will step down from her party\u2019s leadership in December to appease the party base, disgruntled with low poll ratings, with some expecting her resignation as German leader only months away. Macron\u2019s ambitious plans to reform the E.U. have stalled amid Germany\u2019s domestic woes and his own challenges at home.\n\nIn eastern and central Europe, strongmen such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban have taken power and, even while they benefit from E.U. funding, they constantly rail against the union\u2019s leadership. To them, Merkel, Macron and Brussels are synonymous for a fading liberal project that has allowed too many migrants into Europe and is now receding amid a popular backlash.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is Brexit and a U.S. president who did not seem particularly moved by the show of unity that was on display over the weekend.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump with Macron and Merkel during ceremonies at the Arc de Triomphe on Nov. 11 in Paris. (Francois Mori/Pool/AP)\n\nAn optimistic interpretation of Saturday\u2019s rare moment of unity, standing beside a witness of two world wars, would be that the experience of those conflicts paved the way for a political project that has been powerful enough to withstand mounting polarization, at least so far.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the Merkel-Macron alliance will survive intact or how long it can last. As Merkel and Macron held hands this weekend, some sensed not only unity but also melancholy, with Merkel facing an uncertain future in German politics.\n\nThe \u201cold demons,\u201d Macron later said, referring to nationalism and conflict, could easily come \u201cback to wreak chaos and death.\u201d With the memory of two world wars slowly fading and most witnesses already dead, Macron\u2019s supporters say, conflicts might become more likely once again.\n\nIn the case of the 100-year-old lady at least, optimism prevailed on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be here next year,\u201d she said, addressing Macron.\n\n\u201cMe, too,\u201d Macron responded.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhy Trump\u2019s explosive claim that Macron wants a European military \u2018to protect itself from the U.S.\u2019 is so misleading\n\nMacron\u2019s Pyrrhic victory over Trump\n\nMacron denounces nationalism as a \u2018betrayal of patriotism\u2019 in rebuke to Trump at WWI remembrance", "BEIRUT \u2014 The Latest on the Syrian conflict (all times local):\n\n2:15 p.m.\n\nSyrian President Bashar Assad has issued a decree amending a controversial law that allowed authorities to seize property left behind by civilians who fled the civil war.\n\nThe amendment, published by state news agency SANA late Sunday, says residents now have a full year instead of one month to prove they own property in redevelopment zones in order to receive shares in the projects.

The show often employs biting political satire, a knife that would only be dulled with an apology.\n\nThat\u2019s what made Pete Davidson\u2019s in-person apology to Dan Crenshaw, the former Navy SEAL and newly elected Republican representative from Texas\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, so notable. Davidson apologized Saturday for saying Crenshaw, who wears an eye patch after losing an eye in an IED explosion during his third tour in Afghanistan, looks like \u201ca hit man from a porno movie.\u201d\n\n[Pete Davidson apologizes to Dan Crenshaw on SNL: \u2018The man is a war hero']\n\nThe televised apology, in which Davidson called Crenshaw a \u201cwar hero,\u201d went viral, with people on both sides of the aisle praising the show for having Crenshaw on and the congressman-elect for accepting the invitation.\n\nIt was a unique moment for the show. Apologies from Lorne Michaels and crew might be exceedingly rare, but they do happen. It\u2019s just that they\u2019re usually not so straightforward, earnest and seemingly heartfelt.\n\nSometimes, the apology comes quickly, such as when actress Kristen Stewart accidentally cursed during her opening monologue in February 2017. Her hand immediately shot to her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll never be back.\u201d\n\nAnd sometimes the show will offer a tongue-in-cheek half-apology, a wink at controversy if not an actually \u201csorry.\u201d Take Larry David, for example. The comic sparked outrage when he made jokes about dating in concentration camps during a monologue last year: \u201cThe problem is, there are no good opening lines in a concentration camp . . . \u2018How\u2019s it going? They treatin\u2019 you okay? You know, if we ever get out of here, I\u2019d love to take you out for some latkes. You like latkes?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe blowback was immediate and intense. But the show didn\u2019t apologize during the next week\u2019s show \u2014 well, not exactly. Instead, David returned as Bernie Sanders in a fake ad for the Democratic National Committee. In it, David\u2019s Sanders said the party needed to crack down on political incorrectness, such as \u201cthese comics out there who think it\u2019s okay to make jokes about concentration camps. That guy should rot in hell.\u201d\n\n[The debate over Larry David\u2019s Holocaust joke on SNL: Bad taste, or just bad comedy?]\n\nAnother strange half-apology came in 1992. Pop star and general malcontent Sinead O\u2019Connor performed an a cappella version of Bob Marley\u2019s \u201cWar,\u201d though she changed some of the lyrics to address child abuse. She ended the song by tearing up a photo of Pope John Paul II and yelling, \u201cFight the real enemy.\u201d\n\nThe next week, actor Joe Pesci hosted the show \u2014 and he spent his monologue saying how \u201cwrong\u201d he found O\u2019Connor\u2019s antics. Pesci said if it were his show, he would have given her \u201csuch a smack.\u201d At the end of his opening, he presented the photo, taped back together, to the audience.\n\nIf SNL\u2019s cast, crew or network truly feels the need to apologize for a joke, it generally happens off-screen.\n\nIn 2007, for example, SNL aired a sketch in which Bill Hader heard a song that reminds his character of his father, who has Down syndrome. \u201cHe loved this song,\u201d he said in the scene. \u201cI remember we had this one great day at the park. We just had so much fun. He was running in the grass and chasing squirrels. They had this fountain and we threw pennies in it for hours. So great. It was the first day that I ever thought to myself: \u2018I have a dad. And not that I have a dad with Down syndrome. He loved crayons.\u2019\u201d\n\nMembers of the National Down Syndrome Society sent a letter to Michaels and NBC executives, requesting that NBC institute \u201ca network policy that would prohibit and prevent the airing of programming with comments using Down syndrome or other intellectual disabilities as a punchline in the future.\u201d\n\nAlan Wurtzel, then the executive responsible for the NBC Broadcast Standards and Practices Department, sent a personalized letter apologizing for the sketch.\n\n\u201cIn the case of the sketch you expressed concerns about, in reviewing the tape in retrospect I believe we could have exercised greater sensitivity in that regard,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAlthough the Down syndrome reference was a small part of a larger sketch that was intentionally outrageous and hyperbolic, it nonetheless could have been considered insensitive in its reference of individuals who, as you point out in your letter, continue to suffer from harmful stereotyping.\u201d\n\nAnother off-screen apology came in 1992, when Mike Myers and Dana Carvey did a version of \u201cWayne\u2019s World\u201d that poked fun at Chelsea Clinton. After discussing Al Gore\u2019s daughters \u2014 \u201cIf they were a president, they\u2019d be Babe-raham Lincoln\u201d \u2014 Myers then focused on the then-12-year-old Clinton, calling her \u201ca babe in development.\u201d He also said that \u201cwhile it\u2019s true that adolescence has been thus far unkind, we think she\u2019s gonna be a future fox.\u201d\n\nMyers later wrote a letter of apology to the Clintons, and the bit was edited out of rebroadcasts\n\n\u201cWe felt, upon reflection, that if it was in any way hurtful, it wasn\u2019t worth it,\u201d Michaels said at the time. \u201cShe\u2019s a kid, a kid who didn\u2019t choose to be in public life.\"\n\nIt\u2019s telling SNL chose to offer Saturday what seemed like a sincere apology in this sharply divided political climate, though it may easily be a one-time mea culpa. By its own design, the show will undoubtedly offend someone again. Will on-air apologies become the norm? Probably not, but crazier things have happened.", "\n\nFormer first ladies Julia Grant and Michelle Obama.

She and her husband, Barack Obama, commanded a joint book deal reportedly worth more than $65 million.\n\nBut according to presidential historian Craig Fehrman, every first lady memoir has been a bestseller \u2014 many even outsold their husbands\u2019 books.\n\n[For eight years, Michelle Obama watched every word. In her memoir, she\u2019s done with that.]\n\nAfter Grant\u2019s failed effort (which was finally released in 1975), Helen Taft became the first first lady to publish a memoir, \u201cRecollections of Full Years,\u201d in 1914. The New York Sun described it as \u201cbright, witty, delightfully entertaining reminiscences,\u201d in a three-sentence review.\n\n[Why Melania Trump, Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton attended Barbara Bush\u2019s funeral]\n\nTwo decades later, Edith Wilson\u2019s memoir got a longer review, but was derided for its focus on the former first lady\u2019s clothing and social calendar.

Roosevelt\u2019s presidency to the year before her death in 1962. In contrast to Grant and Wilson, Roosevelt\u2019s autobiographies dealt almost entirely with world affairs and her personal life hardly at all.\n\nNearly every evening of Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s presidency, first lady Lady Bird Johnson dictated an account of the day into a tape recorder. By 1969, she\u2019d amassed a nearly two-million word transcript, which she then culled into a memoir.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like cutting one of your darlings,\u201d she told The Washington Post in 1970. The final 300,000-word edit was well-received, and outsold her husband\u2019s \u201cflat\u201d memoir published a few years later.\n\nWith the exception of Pat Nixon, every first lady since has published a memoir.

Kavanaugh, outside the Supreme Court in Washington on Aug. 22. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nThis is the 19th installment in a monthly series reporting on political crowds in the United States. Each month, the Crowd Counting Consortium will post updates about trends and patterns from the previous month. For our counting methods, please see our first post in the series . You can find the rest of the posts here .\n\nFor August, we tallied 573 protests, demonstrations, strikes, marches, sit-ins, rallies and walkouts in the United States, with at least one in every state and the District. This is a modest decline in the average number of events since Donald Trump took office.\n\nOur conservative guess is that between 79,183 and 81,157 people showed up at these political gatherings, although it is likely there were more participants. Though slightly more people than in July, this number of participants is also on the low end in our monthly counts since January 2017.\n\nWe didn\u2019t have participation estimates for 41.1 percent of the events in August. And because mainstream media often neglect to report nonviolent actions \u2014 especially small ones \u2014 we probably did not record every event that took place. Nevertheless, we think our tally gives us a useful pool of information to better understand political mobilization in the United States \u2014 particularly, how reports of crowds change from month to month.\n\n1. The largest events\n\nOne way to picture a month of protest is by examining the largest events. Some scholars have argued that crowd sizes are more important than the number of events in defining how important a protest may be. The largest events we tallied were Trump campaign rallies of 13,500 and 10,000 in Evansville, Ind., and Wilkes-Barre, Pa., respectively. This month, 31 to 32 percent of the people we counted were at Trump/Pence rallies.\n\nAfter that, we counted 16 protests ranging from 1,000 to \u201cthousands.\u201d While one was another Trump rally and two were protesting Trump visits, the rest covered a wide range of issues, including postal workers opposing privatization in Pittsburgh, a pro-gun-control rally in Newtown, Conn., a protest in West Lafayette, Ind., against sexual harassment, and political rallies in Niceville and Tampa in Florida.\n\n2. The issues brought up at the most events\n\nAnother common way researchers gauge support for a particular issue or movement is to count the number of events organized around it. Most months we don\u2019t have crowd size estimates for at least 30 percent of the protests we list, but the frequency may be as significant.\n\nIn August, we counted 139 protests against the appointment of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, many of them on Aug. 26, when a large number of groups, including MoveOn and NARAL, organized events. We also counted 55 anti-racism, Black Lives Matter and anti-hate demonstrations.\n\nFour other issues more or less tied for second place. We counted 45 pro-labor demonstrations, 43 pro-immigration and anti-ICE events, 43 political rallies, and 40 pro-environment demonstrations. We found roughly the same number of protests in these same categories in July.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t count campaign rallies, which our methods often are not picking up. Since this came during a hotly contested midterm election season, we strongly suspect there were more than 43 campaign rallies nationwide. We have been considering how to better pick up news of such events.\n\nIn all, we estimate that 78.7 percent of events were explicitly or implicitly anti-Trump, and that 7.7 percent were pro-Trump. In addition, 13.6 percent were neither in favor of nor against the president or his policies. Those included students protesting an art teacher\u2019s firing in Virginia and Honolulu protesters decrying too much tourism and traffic at Laniakea Beach.\n\n3. The geography of protest\n\nA third way to look at August is by mapping where the protests took place. Florida led the pack with 51. California came in second with 43, followed by New York with 35 events, Pennsylvania and Washington with 29 each, Massachusetts and Texas with 27 each, North Carolina with 20, Colorado with 18, and three states with 17: Illinois, Michigan and Virginia.\n\nOf the 25 largest cities in the United States, all except Memphis saw at least one demonstration in August.\n\n4. How many people were arrested and/or injured in political crowds?\n\nWe counted four reported injuries in July. At about 545 events, or 95.1 percent of the total, no arrests were made in August, for a slightly lower proportion of arrest-free protests than in July. The number of people arrested declined from 352 in July to 290 in August, with at least 194 of those August arrests coming during 15 cases of nonviolent civil disobedience. The biggest single bloc of arrests came Aug. 1, when 74 people were arrested on Capitol Hill protesting Kavanaugh.\n\nYou can download the data here . We\u2019ll release the data for September soon.

How does that success compare with the past? And what was driving it?\n\nThe graph below shows the percentage of statehouse seats gained or lost by the opposition party in midterm elections over the past 100 years. Democrats improved their seat share in statehouses by 4.6 percent. This was just below the historical average for statehouses (5 percent) and also below their gains in the U.S. House (8.5 percent).\n\nDemocratic gains in state legislatures reclaimed more than 250 of the many seats lost during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. Democrats took functional control of an additional seven state legislative chambers, while Republicans took control of only one, the Alaska House. In addition, Democrats gained enough seats to deprive Republicans of supermajorities in Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. This will keep Republicans from having enough votes to override the vetoes of Democratic governors of those states. Democrats achieved supermajorities for themselves in seven chambers.\n\nDemocratic gains in state legislative elections reflect the important role of national politics in subnational elections. Nationwide, the larger the drop in approval of President Trump in a state since he took office, the larger the Democratic gains in the state\u2019s legislature. The graph below shows that if a state\u2019s approval rating of Trump had dropped by 10 percentage points, Republicans lost about 4.5 percent of their statehouse seats in that state.\n\nThe 2018 midterm election set a record for the number of single-party-controlled legislatures. When the new legislators take their seats, only the Minnesota legislature will be divided. The last time the United States had only one divided state legislature was in 1914.\n\nThese Democratic gains set the stage for future elections. A majority of the governors holding veto power over redistricting in 2021 are now Democrats. Moreover, in most states where Democrats won control of a legislative chamber on Tuesday, the legislature has a role in the congressional redistricting process \u2014 although Colorado voters took this power away from the legislature via the initiative process.\n\nIn short, Republican losses in state legislatures were typical for a midterm election, but these losses could translate into larger losses for the party in the future.\n\nSteven Rogers is an assistant professor at Saint Louis University.

The European Union has funded a feasibility study on the proposed East Med pipeline that has the backing of Israel, Cyprus, Greece and Italy.\n\nExxonMobil is scheduled to begin exploratory drilling off Cyprus later this month. Turkey vehemently opposes a gas search by the Cypriot government in the internationally recognized south, saying it infringes on it rights and those of Turkish Cypriots to the island\u2019s natural resources.\n\nThe Cypriot government says drilling is its sovereign right and any potential mineral wealth will be shared equitably with all Cypriot citizens after reunification.\n\nAkinci said he\u2019s open to discussing a proposal by the island nation\u2019s Greek Cypriot president for a more decentralized federal government in a peace agreement that would grant more authority to the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot zones.\n\nPresident Nicos Anastasiades said last week his proposal could make a peace deal more workable by reducing the number of federal responsibilities where disagreement could lead to deadlock.\n\nBut Akinci said Turkish Cypriots would never accept domination by the majority Greek Cypriots and are demanding \u201ceffective participation\u201d in federal decision-making which he insisted wasn\u2019t veto power.\n\nU.N. envoy Jane Holl Lute is expected to return Cyprus for more contacts to determine whether stalled peace talks can resume.\n\nEarlier Monday, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots walked through a newly opened crossing point in the southeastern village of Dherynia in what peace activists are hailing as further breaking down barriers.\n\nDherynia, and another crossing point in the country\u2019s northwest, bring the total of crossing points to open since travel restrictions across the United Nations-controlled buffer zone were relaxed 2003 to nine.\n\nLast month, Anastasiades and Akinci designated Nov. 12 as the crossings\u2019 official opening in a bid to help build momentum toward restarting peace talks.\n\nBut a number of demonstrators at the crossing point voiced their opposition to the openings which they said help to entrench ethnic division.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

International leaders attended a ceremony in Paris on Sunday at mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. (Jean-Francois Badias/Associated Press)\n\nPARIS \u2014 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday became the first Western leader to acknowledge his country had heard recordings of the killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\u201cCanada has been fully briefed up on what Turkey had to share,\u201d Trudeau said from Paris, where he was attending the Peace Forum following the World War I armistice centenary.\n\nHis comments come just two days after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he had given recordings \u201cto Saudi Arabia, to America, to the Germans, the French, to the British, to all of them.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian leader is the first since that announcement to officially confirm that his country\u2019s intelligence had listened to the audio as Canada\u2019s intelligence agencies continue to work \u201cvery closely\u201d with Turkish intelligence on Khashoggi\u2019s killing.\n\nTrudeau said that he himself had not heard the shared audio, which is the latest move by Turkey to maintain international pressure on Saudi Arabia to stop a cover up of the Oct. 2 killing.\n\nHe declined to give any details on the contents of the tapes.\n\nTrudeau also said he thanked Erdogan in person for \u201chis strength in responding to the Khashoggi situation\u201d when the two leaders met in Paris this weekend.\n\nThe cooperation between the two countries comes at a rocky moment. In an unrelated diplomatic spat, Canada in August criticized the arrests of Saudi women\u2019s rights activists. In response, Saudi Arabia ordered the Canadian ambassador to leave the kingdom and froze all new business between the two countries.\n\nFrance\u2019s account somewhat differed on Erdogan\u2019s claim to have shared the audio.\n\nWhen questioned on France 2 Television Monday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said that Turkey has \u201cnot to my knowledge\u201d given the French government any such recordings, and suggested the Turks were playing games.\n\n\u201cIf the Turkish president has information to give to us, he must give it to us... That means he is playing a political game in this situation,\u201d Le Drian said.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu accused his French counterpart of \u201cimpertinence\u201d and said Turkish officials had shared \u201call information\u201d with France\u2019s intelligence on Oct. 24.\n\nGoing further, Cavusoglu suggested that Le Drian may be trying to cover-up the killing so as not to endanger agreements with Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cNo one should be surprised if soon they begin to deny the murder that even Saudi Arabia accepted,\u201d Cavusoglu said. \u201cWho has recently reached which agreement \u2014 this should be carefully looked into.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cAre they trying to cover up this murder? There are things we know ... What kind of an agreement are they in? We are following these.\u201d\n\nCIA Director Gina Haspel, who visited Turkey last month for information on the investigation, is reported to have heard the recordings, the existence of which was leaked to the media but never openly confirmed until Saturday.\n\nAlso Monday, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was in Saudi Arabia where he met King Salman and was expected to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nHunt \u2014 the first British minister to visit Saudi Arabia since Khashoggi was killed \u2014 said he would press the kingdom to fully cooperate with a Turkish investigation into the writer\u2019s killing.\n\n\u201cThe international community remain united in horror and outrage at the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi one month ago. It is clearly unacceptable that the full circumstances behind his murder still remain unclear,\u201d Hunt said in a statement ahead of landing in Riyadh.\n\nA statement by the state-run Saudi News Agency did not make any references to Khashoggi, saying only that King Salman and Hunt discussed bilateral relations and the latest developments in the region.\n\nOn Sunday U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke with the Saudi crown prince on the telephone and \u201cemphasized that the United States will hold all of those involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi accountable, and that Saudi Arabia must do the same.\u201d\n\nThe crown prince is widely suspected of at least having knowledge of the killing, which involved some members of his security entourage. Khashoggi was a Washington Post columnist and a critic of the crown prince who was living in self-imposed exile before his death.\n\nUnder mounting pressure, Saudi Arabia has changed its narrative about Khashoggi\u2019s killing, first saying that he walked out of the embassy the day he disappeared before eventually acknowledging Khashoggi died inside the consulate. Saudi Arabia has also recently acknowledged Turkish evidence that showed the slaying was premeditated.\n\nTurkey says a 15-member Saudi assassination squad strangled and dismembered Khashoggi at the consulate. Media reports have suggested that his body could have been chemically dissolved as it has not yet been found.\n\nSaudi officials characterize the killing as a rogue operation carried out by Saudi agents who exceeded their authority.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Aya Batrawy in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Suzan Fraser in Ankara and Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Whitaker, center, attends a Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery on Sunday. (Andrew Harnik/Associated Press)\n\nNeal Katyal is the former acting solicitor general of the United States and presently serves as a partner at Hogan Lovells and the Saunders professor of national security law at Georgetown University.\n\nThe installation of Matthew G. Whitaker as acting attorney general isn\u2019t just unconstitutional \u2014 although it is unconstitutional. Even if Whitaker\u2019s appointment ever survived a court challenge on constitutional grounds for most of his day-to-day duties at the Justice Department, the fact that he\u2019ll now be performing the sensitive work of supervising Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation raises other deep problems. Putting Whitaker in charge of the inquiry is sharply at odds with the special counsel regulations governing Mueller\u2019s work and with the Justice Department\u2019s rules about who may oversee an investigation.\n\nI had the privilege of drafting the special counsel rules 20 years ago, when I was at the Justice Department. Recall the setting: The independent counsel statute was expiring in June 1999, and there was a robust debate about what should take its place. After the multitude of investigations of the Clinton administration, many in Washington clamored for renewal of the supercharged independent prosecutor in the act. Others, seeing what they believed were abuses by then-independent counsel Ken Starr (and prior independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, who oversaw the earlier Iran-contra investigation of the Reagan administration more than a decade before Starr), believed that something more accountable and less independent had to be created instead.\n\n[Congress or Trump can still block Mueller. I know. I wrote the rules.]\n\nMy Justice Department colleagues and I, along with a bipartisan group on Capitol Hill, worked through many possible scenarios before we settled on the rules that now govern Mueller\u2019s investigation. Everyone in the debate recognized that any enhancement in the special counsel\u2019s accountability had to come from additional supervision by the attorney general. After all, the power to supervise is the power to destroy. The attorney general can stop a special counsel from investigating altogether or stop them from taking a specific step (such as subpoenaing a president). He can read every file of the counsel, and he may even attempt to give information about the investigation to the president in real time. And he plays a crucial role in determining what report by Mueller, if any, is given to Congress and ultimately the public.\n\nBut no one \u2014 and I mean no one \u2014 ever thought the regulations we wrote would permit the president to install some staff member of his choice from the Justice Department to serve as acting attorney general and thereby oversee the special counsel. Such a proposal would have been laughed off Capitol Hill within a nanosecond as fundamentally at odds with the most cardinal principle that no one is above the law.\n\nIt simply cannot be that the president can name his own temporary attorney general to supervise an investigation in which he and his family have a direct, concrete interest. The Constitution itself underscores this \u2014 even assuming Trump\u2019s defenders are right that under the Appointments Clause, an acting attorney general doesn\u2019t always need to be Senate-confirmed. Ordinarily, \u201cPrincipal Officers,\u201d which Cabinet secretaries undoubtedly are, must have Senate confirmation under Article II of our Constitution. The most eloquent defenders of Trump\u2019s action say that Whitaker is serving in a temporary capacity, as an inferior officer, and therefore he can serve without confirmation. But they cite precedents that do not apply, because they concern emergency situations in which no one else has been confirmed by the Senate in the line of succession. In this case, the Senate has confirmed two officials who could continue to oversee Mueller: Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who has been supervising the case ever since former attorney general Jeff Sessions recused himself, and Solicitor General Noel Francisco. Notably, Congress\u2019s succession statute for the Justice Department lists those people as next in line, not a handpicked mere staff member from the bowels of the department.\n\nBut even if the defenders\u2019 claims were true, all that would mean is that Whitaker is an inferior officer who doesn\u2019t need to be confirmed by the Senate. In that situation, someone else, a principal officer, would still need to be in place to supervise Mueller \u2014 who is also an inferior officer. That responsibility would fall once again to Rosenstein under the succession statute Congress authorized.\n\nSometimes, an inferior officer has to supervise other inferior officers with no principal \u2014 say, if no one else has been confirmed at the start of an administration. Or in a more hypothetical scenario, imagine a military conflict in which casualties meant there were no Senate-confirmed officials in a department. But fortunately, today\u2019s Justice Department isn\u2019t dealing with challenges anything like those. There are Senate-confirmed officials at the helm.\n\nAnd regardless of those issues, there is yet another problem, specific to the Mueller investigation. In an emergency situation where an acting head is named, the president is, ultimately, the responsible official who supervises temporary, unconfirmed stand-ins. The idea is that there would at least be someone accountable to the public above the acting officer in those situations \u2014 and as Harry Truman put it, the buck always stops with the president.\n\n[Yes, Trump can fire Mueller. But a normal president would know not to try it.]\n\nHere, though, the idea that the president could be trusted to supervise Whitaker as he oversees Mueller\u2019s work is absurd. The potential for self-dealing, not selfless sacrifice, is rampant. Trump could secretly order Whitaker to do his bidding and terminate an investigation of his or his family\u2019s wrongdoing, and Whitaker would take the blame for it. Trump could shield his actions from public scrutiny, and Whitaker, who depends entirely on the president\u2019s support for his job and later advancement, would have no standing to complain. This is fundamentally at odds with the core principle of American law, going back to the early 1600s, that no one can be a judge in their own case.\n\nThe problems don\u2019t end there. Because even if you think that Trump could surmount that obstacle and supervise an investigation of himself, it cannot be that he can install the compromised Whitaker to the task. Justice Department ethics rules forbid someone from participating in a criminal investigation if they have \u201ca personal or political relationship\u201d with \u201cany person \u2026 which he knows has a specific and substantial interest that would be directly affected by the outcome of the investigation.\u201d That fits this case to a T. Whitaker indeed campaigned for the job, first on TV, and then reportedly with the White House privately, casting aspersions on the Mueller investigation, even saying \u201cthe truth is there was no collusion with the Russians and the Trump campaign,\u201d writing an op-ed called \u201cMueller\u2019s investigation of Trump is going too far\u201d and insinuating that he was part of Trump\u2019s team. He evidently even interviewed for a job to defend Trump against Mueller. And Whitaker ran a past political campaign by Sam Clovis, a Trump confidant who has been subpoenaed by the grand jury as part of the Russia inquiry.\n\nGiven all of that, it is no wonder that Trump has told people that Whitaker would be \u201cloyal.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, Justice Department leaders can supervise investigations despite having personal knowledge about the entities involved. After all, the president nominates every senior official there, so relationships will often exist. But there is a big difference between those garden-variety cases and this one. The department\u2019s ethics rules define a \u201cpersonal relationship\u201d as \u201ca close and substantial connection of the type normally viewed as likely to induce partiality.\u201d And it\u2019s here where the temporary nature of Whitaker\u2019s appointment boomerangs. Like Supreme Court decisions that are tickets \u201cgood for one day only,\u201d when an appointment is made for only one reason, it looks more suspect. That suspicion is exacerbated further because Whitaker has not been confirmed by the Senate. No independent body has signed off on his ethics or his integrity \u2014 and bypassing the Senate makes his appointment appear to be an attempt to put a Trump lackey in charge of the investigation. And finally, the ethics rules ask whether a substitute official can be found easily. In this situation, two can step in. One, in fact, is already acting as attorney general for the purposes of Mueller\u2019s investigation \u2014 yet another reason it looks as though Whitaker has been installed simply to change the way the special counsel\u2019s work is handled.\n\nOur founders recognized that \u201cmen were not angels\u201d and that checks and balances in government were critical to avoid threats to the rule of law. The Whitaker installation does violence to our most basic principles \u2014 enshrined in the Constitution, laws enacted by Congress, the ethics rules that govern our prosecutors and the special counsel regulations themselves.\n\nIt is lawless and unprincipled.\n\nIt must be stopped.\n\nRead more:\n\nSitting presidents can\u2019t be prosecuted. Probably.\n\nTrump\u2019s real issue is that he obstructed justice, and Mueller can prove it\n\nTrump\u2019s problem isn\u2019t that he has bad lawyers. It\u2019s that he\u2019s a bad client.", "\n\nActing attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker, center, attends a Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery on Sunday.

Justice Department ethics rules forbid someone from participating in a criminal investigation if they have \u201ca personal or political relationship\u201d with \u201cany person \u2026 which he knows has a specific and substantial interest that would be directly affected by the outcome of the investigation.\u201d That fits this case to a T. Whitaker indeed campaigned for the job, first on TV, and then reportedly with the White House privately, casting aspersions on the Mueller investigation, even saying \u201cthe truth is there was no collusion with the Russians and the Trump campaign,\u201d writing an op-ed called \u201cMueller\u2019s investigation of Trump is going too far\u201d and insinuating that he was part of Trump\u2019s team. He evidently even interviewed for a job to defend Trump against Mueller. And Whitaker ran a past political campaign by Sam Clovis, a Trump confidant who has been subpoenaed by the grand jury as part of the Russia inquiry.\n\nGiven all of that, it is no wonder that Trump has told people that Whitaker would be \u201cloyal.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, Justice Department leaders can supervise investigations despite having personal knowledge about the entities involved. After all, the president nominates every senior official there, so relationships will often exist. But there is a big difference between those garden-variety cases and this one. The department\u2019s ethics rules define a \u201cpersonal relationship\u201d as \u201ca close and substantial connection of the type normally viewed as likely to induce partiality.\u201d And it\u2019s here where the temporary nature of Whitaker\u2019s appointment boomerangs. Like Supreme Court decisions that are tickets \u201cgood for one day only,\u201d when an appointment is made for only one reason, it looks more suspect. That suspicion is exacerbated further because Whitaker has not been confirmed by the Senate. No independent body has signed off on his ethics or his integrity \u2014 and bypassing the Senate makes his appointment appear to be an attempt to put a Trump lackey in charge of the investigation. And finally, the ethics rules ask whether a substitute official can be found easily. In this situation, two can step in. One, in fact, is already acting as attorney general for the purposes of Mueller\u2019s investigation \u2014 yet another reason it looks as though Whitaker has been installed simply to change the way the special counsel\u2019s work is handled.\n\nOur founders recognized that \u201cmen were not angels\u201d and that checks and balances in government were critical to avoid threats to the rule of law. The Whitaker installation does violence to our most basic principles \u2014 enshrined in the Constitution, laws enacted by Congress, the ethics rules that govern our prosecutors and the special counsel regulations themselves.\n\nIt is lawless and unprincipled.\n\nIt must be stopped.\n\nRead more:\n\nSitting presidents can\u2019t be prosecuted. Probably.\n\nTrump\u2019s real issue is that he obstructed justice, and Mueller can prove it\n\nTrump\u2019s problem isn\u2019t that he has bad lawyers. It\u2019s that he\u2019s a bad client.", "\n\nChip Litchfield and his partner, Penni Brink, enjoy lunch in their RV at the Interstate 24 Campground in Smyrna, Tenn. Both are working their second year with the seasonal Amazon CamperForce as they travel back and forth between Vermont and Florida. (William DeShazer for The Washington Post)\n\nWhen Robert and Jessica Meinhofer told friends they were moving into an RV in 2015, most thought they were crazy.\n\nThe questions poured in: How could they go from living in a 2,000-square-foot home to living in a 250-square-foot trailer? What would they do with their stuff? What would their children, ages 6 and 9, do for school? Was this a midlife crisis? The hardest people to convince were Jessica\u2019s parents, who grew up in an impoverished Latino neighborhood in the Bronx and worked hard so their daughter could have a better life. They couldn\u2019t understand why the couple wanted to live like migrant laborers.\n\nThe Meinhofers are doing this by choice, not financial desperation. They are part of a movement of people ditching \u201csticks and bricks\u201d homes that have long embodied the American Dream and embracing a life of travel, minimal belongings and working when they want.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a family of four redefining what the American Dream means. It\u2019s happiness, not a four-bedroom house with a two-car garage,\u201d said Robert Meinhofer, who is 45.\n\nThe Meinhofers and a dozen others who spoke with The Washington Post about this modern nomadic lifestyle said living in 200 to 400 square feet has improved their marriages and made them happier, even if they\u2019re earning less. There\u2019s no official term for this lifestyle, but most refer to themselves as \u201cfull-time RVers,\u201d \u201cdigital nomads\u201d or \u201cworkampers.\u201d\n\n[America has a massive truck driver shortage. Here\u2019s why few want an $80,000 job.]\n\nMost modern nomads need jobs to fund their travels. Jessica Meinhofer works remotely as a government contractor, simply logging in from the RV. Others pick up \u201cgig work\u201d cleaning campsites, harvesting on farms or in vineyards, or filling in as security guards. People learn about gigs by word of mouth, on Workamper News or Facebook groups like one for Workampers with more than 30,000 members. Big companies such as Amazon and J.C. Penney even have programs specifically recruiting RVers to help at warehouses during the peak holiday season.\n\nA million Americans live full-time in RVs, according to the RV Industry Association. Some have to do it because they can\u2019t afford other options, but many do it by choice. Last year was a record for RV sales, according to the data firm Statistical Surveys. More than 10.5 million households own at least one RV, a jump from 2005 when 7.5 million households had RVs, according to RVIA.\n\nInterest in \u201cRVing\u201d \u2014 either full time or on weekends \u2014 appears to be picking up, especially among young couples. Half of new sales are going to Americans under 45, and purchases by people of color are rising, RVIA found in its 2016 surveys, a change from the 20th century, when white retirees dominated campsites.\n\nBelow, four families \u2014 with members ranging in age from 2 to 84 \u2014 share their experience of life on the road.\n\n\n\nPenni Brink, left, and Chip Litchfield pose for a portrait outside of their RV at the I-24 Campground in Smyrna, Tenn., on Sept. 20.

(William DeShazer for The Washington Post)\n\nPenni Brink (62) and Chip Litchfield (59) have a \u201cWelcome to Margaritaville\u201d sign outside their RV and the kind of easygoing spirit that immediately draws you in. The couple met in the late 1980s when they were working in the same business complex in Vermont, but Chip was married to someone else at the time. Their paths crossed again a few years ago at a craft fair and as their relationship blossomed, Chip suggested they travel in an RV. Penni was apprehensive at first.\n\nCurrent location: Tennessee.\n\nVehicle: 2004 Tiffin Phaeton (They bought it used for $67,000).\n\n\u201cI made it clear I needed a big fridge in the RV because I like to cook,\u201d Penni said. \u201cAnd I needed more than a tiny little bathroom.\u201d\n\nChip took Penni to a used RV lot just to \u201ccheck it out\u201d in 2015, but they ended up buying a 395-square foot camper they call \u201cDaisy.\u201d They say they love this lifestyle now and have no plans to return to a typical home. Penni is selling her condo in Montpelier because they don\u2019t think they\u2019ll need it anymore. They track how many states they have been to on a map on the side of their RV. The current tally is 25.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to be able to travel and work at the places we travel to so we can stay in areas long enough to get to know a place and see America,\u201d Chip said. \u201cThere is so much work out there for us, and we don\u2019t have to make a lot of money.\u201d\n\nPenni hung a \u201cless is more\u201d sign in the RV and has become an expert at cooking on a stove top that\u2019s about a third the size of a typical range. She used to run a small business in Vermont making drapes, blinds and other home decor and still does some work for clients in the RV. She sets up a folding card table for her sewing machine and sends Chip outside to clean the vehicle so she can have more space.\n\nAs they travel, they often pick up jobs to earn money since they don\u2019t want to tap their modest retirement savings, which they dipped into to buy the RV. Right now, they are working in the Amazon CamperForce program that hires about 700 people for warehouse jobs and pays their campsite fees. It\u2019s hard labor \u2014 they often go to bed rubbing each other\u2019s feet \u2014 but the money they earn from September to Dec. 23 is enough to allow them to take the winter and spring off. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\n\u201cBeing able to travel in my 60s and see all the things I missed in my younger years is the best part of this lifestyle,\u201d Penni said.\n\n\n\nRobert and Jessica Meinhofer and their two children in front of the RV.

(They bought it for $22,000 and tow it behind a truck).\n\nAs they started having kids, Robert and Jessica wanted more time with them than a typical day job would allow. They watched a YouTube video of a family that traveled the country in an RV and thought, why not us?\n\n\u201cWe both had full-time jobs. We were doing the 9 to 5 grind. We had the house, but it just didn\u2019t fit us quite right. We were just working, working working,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cWe were longing for freedom.\u201d\n\nWhen Robert was offered a job in Atlanta working for an airline, they didn\u2019t think they had enough money to buy a \u201cproper house\u201d for their two kids, their dog and their cats. So they decided to take the plunge on the RV lifestyle. Jessica convinced her company to let her work remotely so she could home-school their children and work in the RV anywhere in America. Robert works four days at the airline and then gets four days off, which he spends with his family in the RV.\n\nJessica warns it\u2019s not all fun on the road. \u201cInstead of mowing the lawn, we do maintenance on the RV. Things don\u2019t last as long as they do in a house. The level of chores is about the same,\u201d she said, adding that they have to go to the laundromat now. \u201cBut it gives us the freedom to be by the beach one day, a mountain the next or a lake. It\u2019s made all the difference for us.\u201d\n\nThe Meinhofers have met a lot of families with kids on the road, but they haven\u2019t encountered many other Latinos. They think there\u2019s a perception in some communities of color that doing this means you are destitute. They are trying to inspire others to join them with their YouTube channel, Exploring the Local Life, which has become so popular it is making them money.\n\n\n\nJoyce Ann Seid, left, poses for a portrait with her husband, Steve, 77, outside of their RV at the I-24 Campground in Smyrna.

(William DeShazer for The Washington Post)\n\nJoyce Ann Seid (84) and Steven Seid (77) bought their first RV in 2001 to travel on weekends to see the grandkids and visit casinos and parks. By 2010, they moved into the RV full-time. \u201cWe rented our house and wound up getting a bigger RV and then we wound up living in it because we liked it so much,\u201d Steven said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t like our neighbors, we just pack up and leave.\u201d\n\nCurrent location: Wichita\n\nVehicle: 2012 Tiffin Allegro RED Diesel.

Steven gutted the little room in the RV that had a bunk bed and turned it into an office for Joyce that even has a sliding door. Together they remodeled much of the interior, adding sunflowers, a reminder of Joyce\u2019s home state of Kansas, and their RV has a washer and dryer.\n\nThey mostly live off their retirement money, but they pick up various jobs to help pay for vehicle insurance and RV repairs. Steven worked several years in the Amazon CamperForce program, priding himself on being one of the oldest in the warehouse.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re old people, but we hate being retired. We like working,\u201d Steven said.\n\nJoyce, a retired professor, jokes that her husband is earning her \u201cBingo money.\u201d She\u2019s played \u2014 and won \u2014 plenty of games in Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma and is quick to point out there is free parking, even for RVs, at many casinos.\n\nThe Seids say they love it on the road. When Joyce had a stroke two years ago, friends in the campsite pitched in immediately to help and they were able to get to a hospital quickly.\n\n\u201cThis is a great life.

Later the kids, ranging from 2 to 10, went to the campsite pool and quickly made friends with other families.\n\nThe Boohers wanted to show their kids more of America and get closer as a family. Accumulating stuff stopped mattering to them. Instead, they wanted to accumulate experiences. Miranda teaches the kids and is a coach for a Christian organization called Mothers of Preschoolers (MOPS) that helps bring moms of young children together for support and fellowship. The Boohers get plugged into a church wherever they go and find lots of activities for the kids between church and the campsites. Teddy and Amy, 7, are eager to show off the Macarena dance skills they picked up at a recent kids party at a campsite.\n\nRichard is working at with the Amazon CamperForce program for the second year. He\u2019ll be at the warehouse from September to December. It\u2019s very different from his career in IT, but the income allows the family to live this nomadic lifestyle. He earned $11.50 an hour at a fulfillment center in Murfreesboro, Tenn., which went to $15 an hour in November.\n\nWhen the job ends on Christmas Eve, the family heads to Dade City, Fla., to be near old friends for a few weeks before figuring out their next steps. Earlier this year, Richard had a job offer to work at an Amazon return center in Kentucky, so they headed there for a few months.\n\n\u201cThe kids have so many friends everywhere we go,\u201d Richard said. \u201cYou can definitely do this with kids.\u201d", "\n\nMembers of feminist movement Femen are arrested Sunday by French police after demonstrating in front of the Arc de Triomphe as world leaders arrived for ceremonies commemorating the end of World War I.

Police said the protest was the likely target of the bomber, who was on foot. Ambulances raced to the scene, and television footage showed bodies lying in the streets.\n\nGhazni city, the provincial capital, was overrun by Taliban forces in August, and voting in parliamentary elections in October was postponed indefinitely throughout the insecure province.

Mohammad Sharif Yaftali, announced that the army would intensify operations in Ghazni province and that the Afghan air force had carried out an airstrike there Sunday night against the Taliban. Ghazni officials had complained all week that the official response was too slow.\n\nSgt. 1st Class Debra Richardson, a spokeswoman for the U.S.-led military coalition, said U.S. forces are \u201csupporting our Afghan security force counterparts as they fight the Taliban in Jaghori and Malistan districts of Ghazni province.\u201d U.S. forces also are providing close air support while being \u201ccautious with our airstrikes to try to prevent noncombatant casualties,\u201d Richardson said. She said officials have received reports that Taliban forces suffered \u201cheavy casualties.\u201d\n\nThe rash of attacks began early last week in both Hazara-dominated rural districts of Ghazni, which until now have been relatively peaceful in a province long harassed by insurgents.\n\nIn Jaghori, leaders reached by phone in one village said that the community awoke to gunfire late at night and that the few residents who dared venture outside were shot dead. About 5 a.m. last Tuesday, they said, Taliban forces announced on loudspeakers that they had seized control of the area and called elders of Dawood village to meet with them in a mosque.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting the government,\u201d one Taliban fighter said, according to an elder and teacher named Iqbal Nazari.

Mohammad Ali Alizada, a member of parliament from Jaghori, said 23 Afghan commandos and at least 25 local residents were killed as they fought to repel the attack.\n\nIn Dawood, the attackers faced almost no resistance last Tuesday because there was no security outpost. But armed residents from neighboring areas later helped villagers drive out the attackers, who they said killed four people.\n\nTaliban forces attacked adjoining Malistan district on Thursday from three directions, triggering heavy clashes with Afghan security forces and local armed residents, according to its deputy police chief, Aref Rezai. On Sunday, Rezai said, Taliban fighters attacked the district center, but more than 50 insurgents were killed.\n\nUntil recently, Jaghori was known as a bastion of tranquility and development. Even though Taliban forces had besieged Ghazni city in August, triggering four days of fighting that left several hundred civilians and security forces dead, Jaghori residents were stunned when their peaceful district was attacked from at least two directions last week.\n\nIn neighboring Uruzgan province, residents described a repeated onslaught of Taliban attacks over the past two weeks that have killed dozens of troops, including elite forces.\n\n[Attack on Hazaras raises fears of Sunni-Shiite violence in Afghanistan]\n\nA recent report by a U.S. government watchdog agency said casualties among Afghan government forces have reached record levels, while the government controls just a little over half the country. The recent attacks in rural Ghazni represent a new target for the insurgents, ethnic Pashtuns who have previously left these Hazara strongholds alone.\n\nIn a statement on its website Wednesday, the Taliban said the attacks were \u201cnot against any specific race, ethnicity or sect\u201d but are \u201cagainst targets associated with the Kabul administration just like the rest of the country.\u201d If anyone \u201cis seen as a fighter with a weapon in his hand, the Mujahideen will consider them an enemy and take military actions against them,\u201d it said.\n\nGhazni\u2019s Pashtun districts have long been insecure. In parliamentary elections in 2010, Hazaras won all 11 seats in the province because no voting could be conducted in Pashtun areas. The decision to postpone voting there in October angered Hazara leaders.\n\nOn Sunday night, as reports spread of worsening Taliban attacks in the Hazara districts, hundreds of young Hazaras in Kabul took to the streets, walking miles across the capital in the rain toward the presidential palace and chanting: \u201cJaghori!

Mugabe, then 93, soon resigned, ending his 37-year rule.\n\nA year later Zimbabwe\u2019s economic problems have worsened and restrictions on basic freedoms remain, bringing some Zimbabweans to ask \u2018What has changed?\u2019 and \u2018Are things better?\u2019\n\nThe euphoria at Mugabe\u2019s fall has evaporated. Mnangagwa promised Zimbabwe \u201ca new dawn\u201d but to many the country looks depressingly familiar with long lines at the banks to withdraw paltry amounts of cash and shortages of basic goods have led to the rationing of cooking oil, bottled water and beer.\n\n\u201cThey played us, we marched for nothing,\u201d Adrea Magoronye, a Harare resident said as she stood in a line for cooking oil at a supermarket.\n\nMnangagwa started well but his disputed election victory in July, followed by the military opening fire and shooting dead six civilians, a cholera outbreak and an economic implosion have cast a pall over the 76-year-old\u2019s first year in power.\n\nMnangagwa promised to turn the collapsed economy into a middle-class one by 2030, underpinned by democratic reform and reengagement with the U.S. and other Western countries that placed sanctions during Mugabe\u2019s time.\n\nThose sanctions have not yet been lifted and the signs are not reassuring. In September, inflation climbed to its highest since 2010, according to Zimstat, the national statistics agency.\n\nDrugs are in short supply in a country where the health system has long been on the brink of collapse. Private pharmacies with drugs in stock are charging in U.S dollars cash that are scarce and out of the reach of many.\n\n\u201cOur patients are relapsing, deteriorating, operations being cancelled. We urge the government to increase the allocation of forex (foreign exchange) as the gap is currently huge as a matter of urgency,\u201d said the Zimbabwe Medical Association in a statement last week.\n\nZimbabwe is recovering from an outbreak of cholera, a disease described by the president as \u201cmedieval,\u201d that killed at least 50 people in the capital, Harare.\n\nMany fear the current crisis, induced by foreign currency shortages and a ballooning debt, could spiral into the kind of economic collapse seen a decade ago when Zimbabwe\u2019s hyperinflation reached 500 billion percent, according to the International Monetary Fund, and cholera killed more than 4,000 people.\n\nPlastic bags of 100-trillion Zimbabwe dollar banknotes were not enough to buy basic groceries. People fear a return to that hyperinflation.\n\nThe new currency shortage has forced the government to rely on the printing of bond notes, which are rapidly losing value. The government has also been paying civil servants through electronic funds that show up in bank accounts but cannot be turned into cash. There is also a system of mobile money. All of which are devaluing quickly against the U.S. dollar on the black market.\n\n\u201cThe government hasn\u2019t moved in the new direction any distance yet,\u201d said Harare based economic consultant John Robertson.\n\n\u201cThere is no improvement in liquidity, no improvement in foreign reserves either borrowed or earned and no improvement in investment inflows so it is becoming increasingly disappointing. People\u2019s patience has worn really thin,\u201d said Robertson.\n\nMnangagwa\u2019s government asserts that some things have improved.\n\n\u201cA lot has changed. It has been a very active period for us. We hope to achieve the best for Zimbabweans in the nearest future,\u201d deputy information minister Energy Mutodi told The Associated Press.\n\nMutodi admitted that \u201cthe economy is our biggest challenge\u201d but pointed to more freedoms as a sign of a new direction.\n\n\u201cFreedom of expression, freedom of speech, freedom of association; things that were taboo in the past are now being entrenched and fortified in this era,\u201d said Mutodi. Police roadblocks, where motorists were routinely hassled for bribes, have been eradicated, for instance.\n\nCritics say Mnangagwa\u2019s government remains repressive, citing arrests of people accused of criticizing the president, a characteristic of Mugabe\u2019s regime. They also point to the killing of six people when the military fired into protesters on Aug. 2 and the banning of anti-government demonstrations.\n\n\u201cWe are moving back to the pre-coup era,\u201d said Lizwe Jamela, a human rights lawyer in Harare. \u201cPeople are still being arrested for expressing themselves, people are being arrested for dissent and for organizing peaceful demonstrations,\u201d he said.\n\nHe cited the case of a prison guard who was fired on Nov.5 for \u201ctraitorous\u201d behavior after he allegedly posted a pro-opposition tweet as well as the arrest of trade unionists and other activists in recent months.\n\n\u201cThat trend would indicate that we are not yet Uhuru,\u201d said Jamela, using the popular Swahili word for freedom. \u201cWe have a long road ahead.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThis story was corrected to show that Mugabe was 93 when he resigned in Nov. 2017.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Several rockets hit residential buildings, while an antitank missile struck a bus transporting soldiers, the military said, critically injuring a 19-year-old.\n\nAlthough violence in Gaza has flared sporadically in recent months, Monday\u2019s exchange reached a new pitch. The Israeli military struck 70 targets in Gaza, signaling a campaign with wider scope than other recent bombing raids.\n\nThe headquarters of al-Aqsa TV, run by the Islamist militant group Hamas, was among the sites hit, with the Israeli military describing it as a \u201cstrategic terror target.\u201d Hamas, which controls Gaza, said its main internal security building in central Gaza City also was struck.\n\nThe Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said three people were killed and at least two injured in the air raids. Islamic Jihad, another militant group in Gaza, said two of those killed were its fighters.\n\nAs international mediators worked to broker a cease-fire, neither side showed any sign of backing down. After the strike on the television station, Palestinian factions said they would extend the range of their rockets.\n\nMaj. Gen. Kamil Abu Rukun, coordinator of Israeli government activities in the Palestinian territories, said that Hamas had crossed a \u201cred line\u201d and that the military would \u201cdial up\u201d its response.\n\nHe told residents of Gaza to \u201clook carefully\u201d at the pictures from the 2014 war in the territory. \u201cA picture is worth a thousand words,\u201d he said.\n\nMilitant factions in Gaza vowed to retaliate for Israel\u2019s \u201caggressive crime\u201d after seven Palestinian extremists, including a Hamas commander, were killed Sunday night as a group of Israeli special forces troops carried out an operation inside Gaza. One senior Israeli officer also was killed. Armed factions in Gaza began firing rockets in response at communities across the border, which they vowed would \u201cremain unlivable\u201d as long as Israel persisted with such actions.\n\n[A Middle East mirage]\n\nThe violence threatened to derail stuttering efforts in recent months to forge a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, a process that has been brokered by Egypt, the United Nations and Qatar. Israel and Hamas have fought three wars in 10 years, with flare-ups becoming increasingly frequent in recent months as Hamas has urged residents to protest at the fence along the border with Israel.\n\nThe prospects for progress appeared to brighten this weekend after Israel permitted $15 million in cash from Qatar to be transported to Gaza in suitcases to pay long-delayed salaries of civil servants in the Hamas government and ease the suffering of the territory\u2019s 2 million residents as a way to reduce tension.\n\nBut by Monday, thick plumes of smoke were rising above Gaza and southern Israel. Warning sirens blared in communities on the Israeli side, with residents told to stay in bomb shelters. Israeli television showed images of a supermarket on fire, with media reporting that at least 12 people were injured in Monday\u2019s rocket fire.\n\nResidents near the television offices in central Gaza said they had evacuated when a warning missile struck the building. The Israeli military justified the attack by saying that the channel broadcasts \u201cviolent propaganda\u201d against Israel and provides instructions on how to carry out attacks.\n\nHamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum described the strike as a \u201cblatant aggression against journalism\u201d and called on international bodies to denounce it.\n\n\n\nEarlier, the Foreign Press Association expressed concern that Hamas security had prevented two German journalists and a photojournalist from leaving Gaza, citing the \u201csecurity situation.\u201d\n\n[Israel says Iran is behind overnight rocket fire from Gaza]\n\nMilitant factions in Gaza described the targeting of the bus near the border as a \u201cheroic operation\u201d in response to the \u201ctreacherous Zionist crime\u201d a day earlier.\n\nThe Israeli military remained tight-lipped about the incident but said a covert operation had been underway at least two miles inside the Gaza Strip when the unit\u2019s presence was somehow exposed. An exchange of fire between the troops and Palestinian fighters ensued, turning deadly and leading to the Israeli unit\u2019s call for backup from the air.\n\nLt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, chief of the general staff of the Israel Defense Forces, said the team was involved in a \u201cvery meaningful operation for Israel\u2019s security.\u201d\n\n\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short his trip to Paris on Sunday night when news broke that the operation had gone awry.\n\nA statement from the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas\u2019s military wing, said the Israeli team was two miles inside Gaza in a civilian car when the fight broke out.\n\nResidents in the area, east of the town of Khan Younis, said a group of Hamas fighters stopped the vehicle carrying the Israelis to check their identities. It was then that the Israeli unit shot Nour Baraka, a local Hamas leader, and another militant dead, they said.\n\nThe Hamas statement said Baraka was \u201cassassinated.\u201d It said the unit was \u201cdealt with by our fighters.\u201d\n\nResidents said the Israeli vehicle sped off with two Hamas cars in pursuit. Israeli airstrikes killed the five other militants, they said\n\nLt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman, said the operation, \u201clike many others similar to it,\u201d was part of an ongoing effort against \u201cdifferent terrorist organizations.\u201d He said that its mission was not to kill or kidnap.\n\nThe Israeli army did not release the identity of the dead soldier. Speaking on Israeli Army Radio, military spokesman Ronen Manelis said the soldier, despite being injured, had been instrumental in ensuring the safe return of the undercover unit.

The conference marks Moscow\u2019s attempt to get the Afghan authorities and the Taliban together at a table. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has sent a diplomat to observe the discussions. (Pavel Golovkin/Associated Press)\n\nMOSCOW \u2014 A senior Russian diplomat said Monday that Moscow is trying to be an Afghan peace broker because it considers the U.S. has failed in Afghanistan.\n\nRussia\u2019s presidential envoy for Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, said a Moscow conference on Afghanistan Friday that brought together representatives of the Afghan authorities and the Taliban marked an attempt to \u201ctake a modest first step toward full-fledged peace talks.\u201d\n\nKabulov said Monday that Russia\u2019s efforts to help an Afghan peace settlement have been driven not by a desire to undercut the U.S. efforts, but by legitimate security concerns. He emphasized that the continuing fighting in Afghanistan threatens the interests of Russia and its allies in Central Asia.\n\n\u201cAfghanistan is close to our underbelly so national interests of Russia and its allies are at stake,\u201d Kobulov said at a briefing. \u201cWe can\u2019t just sit back and watch impassively what\u2019s going on, and we have let the U.S. know that it doesn\u2019t appear to be successful in settlement efforts.\u201d\n\nKabulov charged that \u201cthe presence of the U.S. and NATO hasn\u2019t only failed to solve the problem but exacerbated it,\u201d noting that the Taliban has steadily expanded its foothold.\n\n\u201cThe West has lost the war in Afghanistan, and it\u2019s reluctant to acknowledge that obvious fact,\u201d Kabulov said. \u201cIf they continue to rely on force, it would only lead to thousands more victims and further ravage the country.\u201d\n\nHe noted that regional powers, including Russia, China, Pakistan and Iran have a strong interest in ending the conflict and should play a more active role.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy sent a diplomat to observe Friday\u2019s conference in Moscow that was attended by several members of Afghanistan\u2019s government-appointed Peace Council and the Taliban. Envoys from China, India, Pakistan and the ex-Soviet nations of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan also attended the meeting.\n\nTaliban officials and Peace Council members have met at past forums elsewhere, and while no formal talks were ever held they have had some face-to face discussions.\n\nThe Taliban has refused direct talks with the Afghan government, which it sees as a U.S. puppet, saying it will only negotiate the end of the 17-year war directly with Washington. The group reaffirmed that position in Moscow, saying it would talk directly to the U.S. to demand its pullout from the country.\n\nKabulov said that he may meet with the U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, later this fall.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Reuters)\n\nAt 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918, war ended on Europe\u2019s Western Front. More than a month earlier, German leaders requested a pause to negotiate a peace settlement, and after weeks of back-and-forth negotiations, the Entente, led by Britain and France, and the United States granted an armistice.\n\nThe guns fell silent in an apparent anticlimax, with German territory unconquered and an army that, if unwilling to fight for Belgium and France, wasn\u2019t unable to defend its homeland.\n\nFor anyone listening to Allied leaders in the final years of the war, the armistice might have come as a shock. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George had insisted as far back as 1916 that \u201cthe fight must be to the finish \u2014 to a knockout.\u201d\n\nWhy did the Entente and the Americans grant an armistice to a Germany that was finally, after years of attrition, out of reserves and on the run? Why didn\u2019t they drive on to Berlin?\n\nHere\u2019s how the war ended with Germany intact and unconquered:\n\n1. The Entente certainly wanted German regime change\n\nGermany\u2019s major power enemies \u2014 Britain, France, the United States, Italy and Russia (until the Russian Revolution) \u2014 wanted to remake it.\n\n[Why the First World War lasted so long]\n\nBritish Foreign Minister Edward Grey described \u201cending militarism,\u201d which meant in no uncertain terms the end of the ruling houses of Hohenzollern in Germany and Habsburg in Austria-Hungary, as a bedrock Entente war aim. By May 1917, President Woodrow Wilson, his own desire for a \u201cpeace without victory\u201d a thing of the past, announced: \u201cThe day has come to conquer or submit.\u201d\n\nThe Entente seems to have decided that, absent guarantees that come with conquest, surrender and possibly dismemberment, Germany couldn\u2019t be trusted not to try again to overturn the European balance of power.\n\nAnd yet when Germany asked for an armistice, its enemies agreed, abandoning the march on Berlin for which their generals, including John J. Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Forces, had begun to plan.\n\n2. Germany initiated a \u201crevolution from above\u201d\n\nSolving a commitment problem was key to the Entente\u2019s war effort. A still-standing, autocratic Germany couldn\u2019t be trusted \u2014 so the argument went \u2014 not to try to dominate Europe again, so its enemies waged a war to eliminate Germany\u2019s ability to challenge the status quo. Oftentimes, parties settle wars driven by commitment problems in total fashion, with the losing side conquered or disarmed.\n\n[What World War I can tell us about international commerce and war today]\n\nBut in negotiations with Wilson, Germany agreed to democratization, putting a civilian government in charge to negotiate the peace. Wilson professed more trust in this government than either the Kaiser or his generals Hindenburg and Ludendorff, who had led a virtual military dictatorship since 1916.\n\nWilson\u2019s demand reflected Immanuel Kant\u2019s vision of a world of peaceful republics and his own diagnosis of the causes of the war, which blamed not the German people but their leaders.\n\nGerman democratization was, however, an imperfect solution to the problem because regimes come and go, and after Entente demobilization there might be nothing to stop a reversal of the revolution. If German democracy failed, the world might find itself right back where it had been in 1914. French Marshal Ferdinand Foch even dismissed the Treaty of Versailles as \u201can armistice for 20 years.\u201d\n\nSo what made this imperfect solution to Germany\u2019s commitment problem palatable? A big part of the answer lay across the Atlantic \u2014 in America.\n\n3. The allies didn\u2019t just fear Germany \u2014 they were wary of rising American power\n\nWhen the fighting stopped in 1918, London and Paris weren\u2019t concerned just about containing postwar Germany. They also cast a wary eye at the United States, the partner whose entry swung the war in their favor but also a partner who stood to take on an increasing role in determining strategy if the war continued into German territory.\n\n[How World War I could have ended a whole year earlier]\n\nAlready dependent on U.S. financing, the Entente believed its role at the peace talks would be further subordinated to Washington if the war effort relied more heavily on American dollars, dreadnoughts and doughboys. If the Entente could credibly claim the lion\u2019s share of work bringing the Germans to the table \u2014 as they could in 1918 \u2014 they stood a better chance of retaining their empires and enjoying the spoils of war (read: reparations and conquests).\n\nBut if they went for Lloyd George\u2019s knockout blow, they risked losing their own positions in the global hierarchy to Wilson\u2019s radical vision for reshaping the global order, which foresaw the humbling of European imperialism before the unparalleled financial and military might of the United States. Continuing the war with a more powerful American partner might bring about Wilson\u2019s desired \u201cpeace without victory\u201d \u2014 with that victory snatched away from a fully exhausted Entente. Precisely because a United States that was more powerful in Europe couldn\u2019t be denied a larger say in strategy and in the negotiation of a final peace treaty, the Entente powers gave up on their dreams of inflicting a total defeat on Germany.\n\nThe end of the Great War in Western and Central Europe, though, came with a whimper that would be overshadowed by the cataclysm of World War II a generation later, when many of the same states would march on Berlin to offer a more permanent answer to the question of who would rule Europe. That the 1914-1918 conflict ended so far short of a total military victory shows us that negotiations between coalition partners can be just as important for shaping how wars end and how long peace lasts after the war as negotiations between enemies. Disagreements between the war\u2019s victors plagued the interwar years, the seeds of which were sown when the United States entered the war with a vision for world order quite at variance with the other great powers whose side it had taken.\n\nScott Wolford is associate professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin.

Confidence: Medium", "For centuries, a small community of fair-skinned, blue-eyed people known as the Kalasha have inhabited a remote valley in northwest Pakistan, farming and raising animals.\n\nLegend has it that their roots go back to Alexander the Great, whose forces passed through the mountainous region in the 3rd century B.C. But scientific studies describe them as having \u201cenigmatic\u201d and \u201ccomplex\u201d origins, possibly being the first migrant group to reach the Indian subcontinent from Asia.\n\nThe Kalasha people, who speak a unique dialect, have no religious texts or places of worship. Instead, they hold ritual celebrations of seasonal change every spring and fall, with colorful costumes and dancing that have long attracted visitors to their alpine home.\n\nIn recent years, however, a new outside influence \u2014 Sunni Islam \u2014 has started seeping into the valley, changing its way of life and dramatically reducing the number of non-Muslims. In the past three years, according to local surveys, 300 Kalasha people have converted, reducing the number of non-converts from about 4,100 to 3,800. Local leaders fear that their culture may be swallowed up and vanish.\n\nThe pace of conversions has accelerated, especially among young people, with Kalasha girls marrying Muslims, and Muslim teachers urging students to convert. There also has been a boom in the construction of mosques, with at least 18 now in the valley.\n\n\u201cAfter hundreds of years, we have been turned into a minority on our own land,\u201d said Shah Feroz, 27, a volunteer teacher in this hillside town of wooden chalets and steep lanes, located in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.\n\nThe religious inroads have become entwined with land disputes, especially over large tracts of forest that Kalasha communities own jointly as a matter of tradition. Last month, one court case over land rights reached the Supreme Court of Pakistan, which instructed the provincial courts to review the issue and report back in a month.\n\nLast summer, the Kalasha gained their first-ever voice in government. Wazirzada Khan, 34, a political activist from the valley, was named to the provincial assembly under the law reserving seats for minorities. His nominator was Imran Khan, then a political leader in the province and now Pakistan\u2019s prime minister.\n\n\u201cThe Kalasha are the indigenous owners of the land, forests and mountains. We need laws to preserve our community,\u201d Wazirzada Khan said. The Kalasha who convert to Islam \u201cdo so willingly,\u201d he added, but the community \u201cshould be declared a national heritage with special status.\u201d\n\nOther Kalasha activists said they were historically disdained by Muslims as \u201cinfidels,\u201d along with a separate group of Kalasha in Afghanistan\u2019s Nurestan province across the border.\n\nAkram Hussain, 34, a social worker, described himself as \u201cthe sole Kalasha survivor in my family\u201d after his mother died and his father married a Muslim woman.\n\n\n\nShah Feroz, 27, is a volunteer teacher in a primary school for the Kalasha community in Broon, Bumburet Valley, Pakistan. (Haq Nawaz Khan/For The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cWhen a Muslim teacher warns you that you\u2019re an infidel and will be burned in hell, a kid can\u2019t evade this threatening influence,\u201d he said. \u201cI was told by my Muslim teachers to read [Islamic verses] that say it is compulsory to become a Muslim. But we don\u2019t pressure our youths about our Kalasha beliefs.\u201d\n\nFeroz, the teacher, noted that all students in mixed schools are taught Islamic studies. On a recent morning in the sixth-grade girls\u2019 class at one local school, all Kalasha and Muslim students were reciting Koranic sayings. Feroz said community leaders want a substitute subject, such as ethics, to be taught.\n\n\u201cIf you start reading Islamic subjects as compulsory from beginning through university level, then you will be influenced by Islamic teachings,\u201d he said.\n\nIn recent years, the Kalasha have attracted European researchers and support, resulting in community benefits including a school that teaches the Kalasha dialect. But some visiting foreigners also have been victims of criminal and insurgent attacks.\n\nAccording to local leaders, in 2002 a Spanish researcher living in the valley, Jordi Magraner, was found dead with his throat slit, along with two local residents. In 2009, a Greek scholar who helped build the Kalasha school, Athanasion Larounis, was kidnapped by Afghan Taliban forces but eventually freed and returned to Greece.\n\nThere have been other episodes of violence attributed to cross-border Taliban intruders. One farmer said two goat keepers had been brutally killed and thousands of goats stolen. \u201cWhen we ask, we are told that the militants came from Nurestan,\u201d he said.\n\nYet the larger clash here is the competition between a long-dominant culture with relaxed, secular values and an aggressively expanding faith with strict rules and conservative moral views.\n\nThe Kalasha grow grapes and offer free wine to visitors at festivals, where men and women dance together.\n\nThey also mourn their dead by dancing and leave them in coffins above the ground, weighted down by stones and valuables, although lately they have started burying them because of robbers.\n\nOne Kalasha farmer complained of hate speech broadcast through local mosque loudspeakers.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t make wine to sell, and we don\u2019t force people to drink,\u201d said Shahi Gul, 50, a mother of six. \u201cWe are blamed by the local clerics as using wine to tempt Muslim youth, which is not true. We do this as it is allowed in our religion and culture.\u201d\n\nGul, whose sisters and niece converted to Islam, said she worries about the conversion of so many Kalasha young people, especially through marriage. She said girls are \u201ceasily converted\u201d by Muslim visitors who woo and marry them.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t force our children over marriage,\u201d Gul said. \u201cWhen a Kalasha girl wants to marry a Muslim, she accepts Islam and shifts to a Muslim family.\u201d\n\nJamroz Khan, a Muslim cleric in the valley whose grandfather converted to Islam 70 years ago, considers Kalasha customs to be wicked, but he said no one in the valley has been converted by force.\n\n\u201cWe do our preaching and convince them they should come to the right path,\u201d he said. \u201cWe teach them that they are practicing infidelity by mixed gatherings, dancing and using alcohol. We ask them to stop these infidel practices.\u201d\n\nKhan noted with pride that several decades ago, \u201cthere was not a single Muslim family here, but now half of the village has accepted Islam.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll praise to Allah, we are preaching to convert all,\u201d he said.\n\nTo Lali Gul, a Kalasha woman who sells traditional costumes and caps, the spread of Islam across the valley will be hard to stop. Muslim tourists, she said, bring money and take brides. When her daughter met a Muslim visitor and converted to marry him, she did not try to dissuade her.\n\n\u201cWe are free and open-minded people. We don\u2019t interfere in our children\u2019s decisions to be a Kalasha or Muslim,\u201d Gul said. \u201cBut our community is shrinking. I fear that very soon, there will be no Kalasha left in this valley.\u201d\n\nPamela Constable in Islamabad contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nRelease of Christian woman acquitted of blasphemy roils Pakistan\n\nIn Pakistan, an ambitious effort to plant 10 billion trees takes root\n\nIndian-Pakistani relations were getting warmer \u2014 until the release of a postage stamp\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "\n\nOn \"Fox News Sunday\" with Chris Wallace, Kellyanne Conway defended the controversial video of CNN reporter Jim Acosta that was shared by the White House.

The video, which at first looks authentic, shows Acosta\u2019s arm swiftly coming down on the arm of the young female aide who is trying to take the microphone from him. Missing from the seconds-long clip is Acosta saying, \u201cPardon me, ma\u2019am,\u201d as he maintains a firm grip on the microphone and continues peppering Trump with questions.\n\nWallace asked Conway on Sunday about the White House\u2019s responses to what he described as the \u201cnow infamous confrontation\u201d that disrupted Trump\u2019s post-midterms news conference. Wallace specifically made reference to White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeting the video that was \u201cclearly altered to make it look like it was more of a physical confrontation\u201d and the decision to yank Acosta\u2019s White House press credentials.\n\n[How CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta became the reporter Trump loves to hate]\n\nAsking for clarification about what Wallace meant by \u201cedited, or as others are saying, quote, \u2018doctored\u2019 video,\u201d Conway said it was clear Acosta \u201cput his hands on [the intern] and grabbed the mic back.\u201d\n\nWallace, who last week slammed Acosta for his \u201cembarrassing\u201d behavior during the news conference, agreed with Conway that the CNN reporter did make physical contact with the intern while the pair tussled over the microphone.

The repeated frames, which were seen only at the moment Acosta\u2019s arm made contact with the intern\u2019s, appeared to distort and exaggerate his movement, Shane Raymond, a journalist at Storyful, a global social media intelligence agency, told Harwell.\n\nCritics also took issue with Conway\u2019s confused claim that people in sports media speed up clips when they need to review close plays. In reality, the exact opposite is done.\n\nThe amazing defense offered by @KellyannePolls to the doctored video sent out by @PressSec was \u201cThat\u2019s not altered, that\u2019s sped up.

(Pervez Masih, File/Associated Press)\n\nISLAMABAD \u2014 The Pakistani government, already struggling with a crisis surrounding a Christian woman acquitted of blasphemy charges after eight years on death row, now has to deal with \u201cfake\u201d images on social media purporting to show her outside the country.\n\nThe deceptive images have prompted death threats to a lawmaker shown in one photograph, and are likely intended to whip up radical religious fervor over Aasia Bibi\u2019s case. It\u2019s unclear who is behind the circulation of the images.\n\nRadical Islamists have held mass protests and demanded that she be publicly executed. They\u2019ve also filed a petition to repeal her Supreme Court acquittal. The government says Bibi remains in Pakistan, at a secret location for her own protection, until the review process is finished.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan has warned hard-line groups against using her plight to further their political aims with street protests.\n\nHe has defended the Supreme Court judges who on Oct. 21 acquitted the 54-year old mother of five of blasphemy charges. But he has also acquiesced to demands by the Islamists that the acquittal be reviewed in an appeal process.\n\nBlasphemy is a highly charged issue in Pakistan, where mere allegations of insulting Islam or the Prophet Muhammad can incite mobs into a frenzy of violence. The charge carries the death penalty, and critics say the blasphemy law is abused to settle religious scores.\n\nInformation Minister Fawad Chaudhry slammed the \u201cfake\u201d postings on Monday, one of which claims to show Bibi meeting Pope Francis. The photo is actually of Bibi\u2019s daughter from two years ago. Bibi and her family have always maintained her innocence and say she never insulted Islam\u2019s prophet.\n\nChaudhry said the images misidentifying Bibi prompted death threats to a lawmaker in one photograph, Fazal Khan from the ruling Tehreek-e-Insaf Party. The lawmaker\u2019s constituency is in a deeply conservative region in the country\u2019s northwest.\n\n\u201cPeople can even be killed because of such fake postings,\u201d Chaudhry said. The pictures were widely circulated on social media in Pakistan and shared on several local journalists\u2019 groups, even a police and a media group.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to seek cooperation from Twitter and Facebook against such fake news,\u201d Chaudhry added.\n\nBibi\u2019s ordeal dates back to 2009 when she went to fetch water for herself and fellow farmworkers. An argument took place after two Muslim women refused to drink from the same container as Bibi, who is Roman Catholic. The women later said Bibi had insulted the Prophet Muhammad, and she was charged with blasphemy. She was put on trial, convicted and sentenced to death in 2010.\n\nFollowing Bibi\u2019s acquittal last month, the founder of the radical Tehreek-e-Labbak Party, Mohammed Afzal Qadri, issued a fatwa calling for the death of the three Supreme Court judges who handed down the acquittal and the overthrow of Khan\u2019s government. He also incited the military to mutiny.\n\nIn 2011, the governor of Punjab province was killed by his own guard after he defended Bibi and criticized the blasphemy law. A year later, the minister for minorities was shot and killed.\n\nBibi, who was freed from detention last week, is being held at a secret, closely guarded location in Pakistan. Those who are familiar with her circumstances say she is expected to remain there until the Supreme Court carries out the review.\n\nOn Sunday, the prime minister said the Supreme Court\u2019s decision would be final. For now, it\u2019s unclear when the review will be held or who would defend Bibi. Her lawyer, Saiful Malook, fled the country following her acquittal, fearing for his life.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

A gathering of leaders of Libya\u2019s quarrelling factions and of countries keen on stabilizing the North African nation opens in Monday Nov. 12, 2018, where Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte will be greeting arrivals Monday evening in Sicily, aimed at finding a political settlement that would bolster the fight against Islamic militants and stop illegal migrants crossing the Mediterranean to Europe\u2019s southern shores. (Kerstin Joensson, File/Associated Press)\n\nPALERMO, Sicily \u2014 Representatives of Libya\u2019s quarrelling factions and of countries keen on stabilizing the North African nation started meetings in Sicily on Monday, as Italy encourages a political settlement that could bolster the fight against Islamic militants and stop illegal migrants from crossing the Mediterranean to Europe\u2019s southern shores.\n\nItaly\u2019s anti-migrant populist government organized the two-day conference in Palermo with an eye to making progress on a long-elusive goal of ending years of lawlessness in Libya. Rival Libyan administrations jockey for power, militias clash in often deadly bids to boost prestige and influence, and human traffickers exploit the chaos to pursue their lucrative business from their base in the North African country.\n\nArriving a few hours before a closed working dinner to begin the conference, Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte told reporters the conference aims to \u201chelp end the armed conflicts and to help the Libyan stabilization process\u201d in the framework of the United Nations.\n\nEventually, the West hopes Libyans will have a democratic election, but the conference isn\u2019t aiming to fix a date. \u201cWe want the Libyan people to be able to democratically decide their own future,\u201d Conte said.\n\nThere was skepticism on how much progress might be made toward stability at the conference in a luxury seaside hotel in large part because it wasn\u2019t clear if a key player, Gen. Khalifa Hifter, commander of the self-styled Libyan National Army with a power base in eastern Libya, would meet with his Libyan rivals in plenary sessions set for Tuesday.\n\nConte warmly shook hands with Hifter as he greeted guests arriving for the dinner session.\n\nLibya plunged into chaos after the 2011 uprising that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, and it is now governed by rival administrations in the east and west with both relying on the support of militias.\n\nIt has also become a haven for Islamic militants and armed groups, including several from neighboring countries, which survive on looting and human trafficking, particularly in the remote south of the country.\n\nConte met on Monday with Ghassan Salame, the U.N. special envoy to Libya, who last week told the U.N. Security Council that the \u201cstatus quo in Libya was untenable\u201d with the country.\n\nOne of Salame\u2019s other meetings on conference sidelines saw him exchange views on political developments with Fayez Serraj, the prime minister of the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli and a chief rival of Hifter.\n\nItaly has been a staunch Serraj backer.\n\nLibya\u2019s neighbor to the east, Egypt, backs Hifter. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, among the participants, had recently reiterated Cairo\u2019s call for lifting the international arms embargo against Libya.\n\nIn an interview published Monday in Italian daily La Stampa, Conte portrayed the gathering as an opportunity to \u201csustain the creation and deployment of regular armed forces and security forces.\u201d\n\nFor rights advocates, the conference posed another kind of opportunity: To draw attention to the plight of migrants trapped in Libya, now that the nearly nightly launching of human traffickers\u2019 boats from Libya\u2019s coasts has sharply dropped off as Italy and Malta have closed their ports to private rescue groups\u2019 vessels.\n\n\u201cAmnesty International is calling on all those taking part in the conference to ensure that human rights of all people in the country, including refugees and migrants, are placed at the center of their negotiations,\u201d the rights group said in a statement.\n\nIt decried that Libya has \u201crepeatedly delayed\u201d the opening of a long-promised processing center for the U.N. refugees organization, to relocate refugees from \u201cabusive detention centers.\u201d\n\nWith Libya\u2019s rich oil and gas resources, energy-rivals Italy and France have been jockeying for influence.\n\nFrance hosted a meeting on Libya in May, when rival Libyan leaders tentatively agreed on a roadmap for parliamentary and presidential elections but declined to sign a declaration outlining their commitments.\n\nConte\u2019s six-month-old government \u2014 and especially anti-migrant Interior Minister Matteo Salvini \u2014 sees a more stable and secure Libya as the best outcome for Italians, and for the right-wing voter base in particular.\n\nHifter has been instrumental in the fight against militants, going after them in their eastern hideouts and occasionally foraying into the vast and largely lawless south. However, a deadly overnight attack last month by militants from the extremist Islamic State group showed the limitations of his army.\n\nMeanwhile, encounters on the conference\u2019s sidelines focused on encouraging Libyan economic reforms.\n\nStephanie Williams, a deputy to Salame, the U.N. special representative, official, said in a tweet that there was a \u201cpositive tendency\u201d in the economic sphere.

It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u2014 President Trump, in an interview with WTVJ NBC6 Miami, Oct. 31, 2018\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an enemy of our country. You\u2019re a general with war on your mind. You\u2019re a dictator who we hate and who\u2019s against us. And that dictator and his wife have a baby on American soil. Congratulations. Your son or daughter is now an American citizen. Does anybody think this makes sense? Does anybody think it makes sense? Congratulations, general, you have a United States citizen as your daughter. It\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s crazy. But we\u2019re getting it all worked out.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Trump, at a campaign rally in Columbia, Mo., Nov. 1, 2018\n\nTrump could have picked literally any other imaginary threat during these riffs on birthright citizenship. But he somehow landed on enemy generals and foreign rulers, whose children are some of the rare exceptions to birthright citizenship under a 120-year-old decision by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Facts\n\nTrump announced in an interview with Axios that he wants to end by executive order the constitutional right to birthright citizenship. The Supreme Court ultimately could find a way to rule in favor of Trump, but there is wide agreement among legal scholars that Trump\u2019s plan is unconstitutional: The president can\u2019t do this by himself and would need an act of Congress or a constitutional amendment.\n\nThe 14th Amendment and two key Supreme Court decisions indicate that any child born on U.S. soil has a right to U.S. citizenship.\n\nIn its 1898 decision in U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court listed the exceptions of \u201cchildren of foreign sovereigns or their ministers, or born on foreign public ships, or of enemies within and during a hostile occupation of part of our territory, and with the single additional exception of children of members of the Indian tribes owing direct allegiance to their several tribes.\"\n\nThe court also described these same exceptions as covering \u201cchildren born of alien enemies in hostile occupation and children of diplomatic representatives of a foreign State.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it. No more exceptions. Even if a dictator or a hostile foreign general during wartime or a spouse managed to have a child in the United States (which is improbable at best), there\u2019s a Supreme Court ruling that covers this situation and appears to contradict the president. (What are the odds?)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where he\u2019s getting that from,\u201d said Stephen H. Legomsky, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis and former chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Obama administration. \u201cAs a practical matter, I\u2019ve never heard of such a situation arising anyway.\u201d\n\nHowever, Trump is not entirely off-base. Legomsky said, \u201cGiven Wong Kim Ark, it\u2019s clear that the children of enemy occupiers would not be covered. . . . in addition to that, the children of foreign diplomats are not covered.\u201d\n\nThere has \u201cnever been any legal authority for the proposition that the children of foreign generals would not be covered,\u201d he said, unless it was during an occupation.\n\nLet\u2019s say an enemy general or a spouse gave birth while vacationing at Disney World. The proud parent would have to be invading or occupying the state of Florida for the child to be exempt from U.S. citizenship under Wong Kim Ark. \u201cThere\u2019s no provision that says because your parents hate the United States, you\u2019re not covered,\u201d Legomsky said.\n\nTrump imagined \u201ca general who\u2019s on an opposing army, and we\u2019re at war, comes into the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether he was talking about an invasion, but his scenario comes awfully close. How else would an enemy general set foot here during a war?\n\nThings get a little trickier when imagining a foreign dictator or a spouse giving birth in Florida.\n\nThe \u201cchildren of foreign sovereigns or their ministers\u201d are not eligible for birthright citizenship under Wong Kim Ark, so all the monarchs are out. As for a dictator, the dictionary defines \u201csovereign\u201d as \u201cone possessing or held to possess supreme political power or sovereignty,\u201d as \u201cone that exercises supreme authority within a limited sphere,\u201d as \u201can acknowledged leader\u201d or \u201carbiter.\u201d Kim Jong Un, for example, seems to check all the boxes, and like a monarch, his title was passed on from his father and grandfather.\n\nThe White House did not respond to our questions, and there\u2019s no word when Trump might issue this executive order.\n\nAt his Nov. 1 rally, Trump also complained that \u201cthis policy has even created an entire industry . . . birth tourism.\"\n\n\u201cPregnant mothers from all over the world travel to America to make their children instant lifelong citizens with guaranteed everything,\u201d he said.\n\nThis does happen, though the birth tourism industry caters mostly to wealthy Russian and Asian women. Estimates vary as to how many thousands of cases there are per year, so it\u2019s hard to get a good read on this issue. One place to start might be Trump\u2019s properties in Florida, a hot spot for Russian birth tourism. The Trump Organization does not benefit directly, according to the Daily Beast, because the expectant Russians are subleasing privately owned condos marketed to them for long stays. However, the nearby Trump International Beach Resort gets some of their business if they wander over there.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nHostile dictators and enemy generals are not really the target market for the birth tourism industry, but it won\u2019t stop us from rating Trump\u2019s claims. We\u2019re giving Three Pinocchios. The president mentioned enemy generals \u2014 but not specifically an occupation of U.S. territory, which is the key ingredient for an exception to birthright citizenship. The stuff about dictators is much shakier. The Supreme Court said 120 years ago that the children of \u201cforeign sovereigns or their ministers\u201d were not eligible for birthright citizenship. Dictators seem pretty sovereign to us.\n\nThree Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 The Turkish coast guard on Monday recovered four bodies and was still searching for six missing migrants after their boat sank in the Aegean Sea, Turkey\u2019s state-run news agency reported.\n\nAnadolu Agency said three other migrants were rescued as part of a search-and-rescue operation launched after the boat, with a total of 15 people on board, went down off the coast of Dikili, close to the Greek island of Lesbos.

(Matt Slocum/Associated Press)\n\nThe Washington Redskins are running away with the NFC East.\n\nOr, perhaps more accurately, the rest of the NFC East is retreating from the Redskins.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys\u2019 surprising 27-20 victory Sunday night in Philadelphia means that the Redskins, who won in Tampa earlier in the day, have a two-game lead in the division. They also are the only NFC East team even with a .500 record. And the Eagles, the defending Super Bowl champions, do not exactly look poised for a second-half run to a repeat division title.\n\n\u201cWe keep waiting on Philly to be Philly \u2026. Washington is gonna win this division \u2026. Philly ain\u2019t Philly,\u201d Deion Sanders, the Hall of Fame cornerback who had stints with both the Cowboys and the Redskins, said on the NFL Network\u2019s postgame show.\n\n[Redskins\u2019 win over Bucs didn\u2019t look pretty, but it passes smell test]\n\nThe Cowboys won on a night when quarterback Dak Prescott and tailback Ezekiel Elliott recaptured the magic from their successful rookie-tandem season in 2016. Elliott ran for 151 yards and a touchdown. He added a touchdown catch to assist a 26-for-36, 270-yard passing performance by Prescott. The Dallas offense rarely has operated so efficiently this season.\n\n\u201cWe just had to come out and play Cowboy football,\u201d Elliott told NBC after the game. \u201cWe\u2019ve been having a rough year offensively 100 percent. We haven\u2019t been doing what we\u2019re capable of doing. Today we came out. We started fast. We executed and we finished the ballgame.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys rebounded from a deflating loss to the Tennessee Titans last Monday night that dropped their record to 3-5. Their trade with the Oakland Raiders for wide receiver Amari Cooper, which cost them a first-round draft pick, put them in win-now mode. The problem was that they weren\u2019t winning now. The job security of Coach Jason Garrett came under scrutiny after the Tennessee defeat, as did the long-term prospects for Prescott to be a franchise quarterback.\n\nGarrett coached aggressively Sunday night, almost as if his job depended on it. The Dallas offense lined up for a fourth-and-one gamble on its own side of the field in the first half, only to commit a false-start penalty and then punt. The Cowboys turned a successful fake punt into a field goal.\n\nThey also got a first-half field goal after Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz threw an early interception to rookie linebacker Leighton Vander Esch. Prescott put together a very good drive just before halftime and the Cowboys had a 13-3 lead at the break.\n\nBoth offenses got moving in the second half. The Eagles used two touchdown passes from Wentz to tight end Zach Ertz to tie the game, first at 13 and then at 20. But the Cowboys had a reply from Elliott each time, first with his touchdown catch and then with his touchdown run.\n\nThe Cowboys withstood a second-half missed field goal by kicker Brett Maher and made the necessary plays on defense down the stretch to hold on, albeit just barely. Vander Esch had a key tackle on the Eagles\u2019 second-to-last drive, which ended with a fourth-down completion short of a first down. The Eagles would get the ball back, but Ertz\u2019s 14th catch of the game came on the final play, which resulted in a lateral to wide receiver Golden Tate, who was tackled at the Dallas 9.\n\nDallas has played well on defense practically all season, and Vander Esch played a starring role Sunday night in the absence of injured linebacker Sean Lee.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to go,\u201d Vander Esch told NBC. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to keep attacking every single play, go after the ball. We\u2019ve got to create turnovers. We\u2019re a defense that\u2019s gonna run to the ball every single snap and we\u2019re always gonna be around it. You snap on the film and you\u2019re gonna see guys running.\u201d\n\nAll of it worked out very well for the Redskins. The Cowboys and Eagles are now tied for second place with identical 4-5 records. A win by the Eagles would have created some momentum for the champs to perhaps get on a second-half roll and overtake Washington. Instead, the wait continues for them to resemble the Eagles of last season.\n\nWentz again had good numbers Sunday night, throwing for 360 yards and the two touchdowns to Ertz. But he made the key mistake with the early interception to Vander Esch. And the Eagles again had trouble turning their offensive efforts into points. Tate, obtained in a trade with the Detroit Lions to provide a spark, had only two catches for 19 yards in his Eagles debut. Even the gambles by Coach Doug Pederson are backfiring. The Eagles failed on a fourth-and-one try from the Dallas 20 in the first half.\n\nThe Redskins are not an overpowering team. The injuries on their offensive line have made their offense close to nonfunctional at times recently. But their defense rebounded from a poor performance in a loss to the Atlanta Falcons to perform extremely well Sunday against the Buccaneers.\n\n[\u2018Bend but don\u2019t break\u2019: Redskins give up 501 yards but just 3 points in win over Bucs]\n\nIt remains to be seen if anyone in the division can mount a serious challenge.\n\nThe Cowboys already have lost to the Redskins, meaning that they are, in effect, three games behind. Cooper was more of a factor in his second game with the team, catching six passes for 75 yards Sunday night. But standout guard Zack Martin is playing on an ailing knee \u2014 he left the game Sunday night but returned \u2014 and the interior of the offensive line is depleted. When the Cowboys cannot establish Elliott and the running game, the offense has struggled. Sunday night\u2019s triumph was their first road victory of the season.\n\nThe Eagles still face the Redskins twice, giving them a chance to gain ground with a sweep. But they also have road games left at New Orleans this week and at Los Angeles against the Rams in mid-December. If they lose both of those games, they would have very little margin for error left to remain a playoff contender.\n\nThe New York Giants, with a record of 1-7, long ago were ensured of slogging through a lost season.\n\nOnly one other division, the NFC West, has a second-place team with a losing record.\n\nMuch remains to play out. The Redskins still could fall apart. But the Cowboys did them a big favor Sunday night, and the rest of the NFC East looks more and more like a mess.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nNFL Week 10 wrap: News, analysis, injury updates and more\n\nAs Saints stomp Bengals, it\u2019s clear they\u2019re the NFC\u2019s top Super Bowl threat\n\nThe Patriots\u2019 path back to the Super Bowl just got more complicated\n\nTitans\u2019 Dion Lewis takes \u2018personal\u2019 pleasure in win over \u2018cheap\u2019 Patriots\n\nRams' Andrew Whitworth donates game check to Thousand Oaks shooting victims, families", "Want smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

It might have been an easy opportunity to mend fences and honor the sacrifices of Washington\u2019s traditional allies. Instead, Trump only underscored the widening gulf between the United States and its European partners.\n\nBefore he even landed, Trump provoked controversy by attacking French President Emmanuel Macron over comments Macron made on international security.\n\nThen, on Saturday, Trump skipped a planned visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, which honors U.S. soldiers killed in the Battle of Belleau Wood \u2014 because of rain in Paris. The decision sparked a furious reaction from American commentators and observers elsewhere, who said the bad weather should not have stopped Trump from doing his duty. A host of other leaders and dignitaries, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, braved the elements to pay their respects.\n\n\u201cRain was a regular feature on the Western Front,\u201d Tobias Ellwood, a conservative British parliamentarian and the country\u2019s minister for veterans, quipped in a tweet. \u201cThankfully it did not prevent our brave heroes from doing their job.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Trump \u2014 as well as Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 skipped a procession of dozens of world leaders, who walked together down the Champs-Elysees toward the Arc de Triomphe. The symbolism was not lost on the watching press. Then, by that famous monument, Macron delivered a pointed rebuke of Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda.\n\nOld demons are rising again. New ideologies are manipulating religions, and history is threatening to repeat its tragedies. Let us vow once more as nations to ensure peace is the utmost priority, above all else, because we know what it cost. https://t.co/skJ6K5SDO1 \u2014 Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) November 11, 2018\n\n\u201cNationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,\u201d Macron said. \u201cBy putting our own interests first, with no regard for others, we erase the very thing that a nation holds dearest, and the thing that keeps it alive: its moral values.\u201d\n\nWhatever \u201cbromance\u201d once existed between Trump and his French counterpart has long faded, no matter a few polite tweets shared this weekend. Trump withdrew from both the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, ignoring Macron\u2019s efforts to persuade him otherwise. He has cheered the rise of right-wing populists throughout Europe, including domestic rivals of Macron. Meanwhile, the French president has consciously styled himself in opposition to Trump.\n\n\u201cI think [Macron] has shed any illusion about Trump that flattering him will be a way of getting concessions,\u201d Thomas Wright of the Brookings Institution told The Post. \u201cBut he is hesitant to push back hard because he\u2019s not sure what that will get him. It\u2019s cautious realism.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria, Macron insisted that his beliefs are not those of the jet-setting \u201cglobalist\u201d caricature evoked by Trump and his far-right counterparts in Europe, but are instead those of a pragmatic internationalist aware of the shared challenges facing world leaders.\n\n\u201cI would say I\u2019m a patriot. I do believe in the fact that our people are very important and having French people is different from German people. \u2026 But I\u2019m not a nationalist,\u201d Macron said. \u201cI\u2019m a strong believer in cooperation between the different peoples, and I\u2019m a strong believer of the fact that this cooperation is good for everybody, where the nationalists are sometimes much more based on a unilateral approach and the law of the strongest, which is not my case. That\u2019s probably our difference.\u201d\n\nIn that belief, Macron is joined by German Chancellor Angela Merkel \u2014 arguably the most important establishment figure in Europe but a diminished leader now clearly in the twilight of her career. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to destroy institutions, but it\u2019s incredibly difficult to build them,\u201d Merkel said Sunday, once more defending the post-World War II international order that has guaranteed much of Europe decades of peace and prosperity.\n\nOn Saturday, Macron and Merkel went to Compiegne, where the armistice that ended World War I was signed \u2014 and where Hitler compelled France\u2019s surrender in 1940. At a site of national victory and defeat for both countries, they rallied for unity.\n\nBut such an emotional scene may not quite reflect the spirit of the present. Like Macron, Merkel has warned of Europe\u2019s need to strengthen itself collectively in the face of an unreliable United States. Yet both leaders face stiff political tests at home.\n\nMacron\u2019s approval ratings slumped to record lows in recent months. A poll last week placed Macron\u2019s centrist ruling party behind the French far-right ahead of next year\u2019s elections for the European Parliament. And Merkel\u2019s announcement that she will not seek reelection as German chancellor was seen as a mark of the waning clout of liberal centrism on the continent.\n\nAs both the far right and the left gather strength, European leaders are struggling to find common ground on issues ranging from monetary policy to immigration and how to confront the Kremlin.\n\nDivided one century ago, United today. Thank you to every leader and guest who came to Paris from all over the world this weekend to build peace. We will not be able to say to future generations that we didn\u2019t know. Peace is our treasure and our responsability. \u2014 Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) November 11, 2018\n\n\u201cEuropeans are too deeply divided among themselves \u2014 and on the fundamentals,\u201d Dominique Mo\u00efsi, a foreign policy analyst at the Institut Montaigne in Paris and former Macron campaign adviser, told my colleague James McAuley. \u201cHe\u2019s weakened by the fact that he\u2019s orphaned by Merkel and he\u2019s weakened inside by the spectacular fall of his popularity.\u201d\n\nThese divides \u2014 and his own domestic travails \u2014 hobble Macron\u2019s attempts at global leadership, analysts suggest. \u201cThere is a clear north-south division over the euro crisis and an east-west division over migration and Russia,\u201d Mark Leonard of the European Council on Foreign Relations told The Post. \u201cYou also have highly polarized societies in most member states, and that does mean that having a single leader of Europe is kind of utopian at the moment.\u201d\n\nAs part of the pleasantries of the visit, Macron declared his \u201cgreat solidarity\u201d with Trump.

(Charlie Riedel/Associated Press)\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014 Patrick Mahomes will always have some special TV footage of the Kansas City Chiefs celebrating his record-setting touchdown pass in a win over the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday.\n\nThat\u2019s because Tyreek Hill was the one recording it.\n\nMahomes threw for 249 yards with two TD strikes to Hill, but it was the second one that sent the Chiefs\u2019 first-year starter past Hall of Famer Len Dawson for the single-season TD record. It was the 31st for Mahomes \u2014 with six games yet to play \u2014 and it helped lift Kansas City to a 26-14 victory over the Cardinals and another game closer to the No. 1 seed in the playoffs.\n\nHill celebrated the score by leaping into the stands, then commandeering the CBS camera \u2014 earning him an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty from the officials and a sharp rebuke from coach Andy Reid.\n\n\u201cThe celebration just came into my head,\u201d Hill said. \u201cFor him to come in and do that, that\u2019s amazing, man. People doubted him \u2014 \u2018He wasn\u2019t going to do this, he wasn\u2019t going to do that.\u2019 I\u2019m proud of him.\u201d\n\nHill had seven catches for 117 yards. Kareem Hunt pounded his way for 71 yards rushing. The defense came up with five sacks and two picks. And the Chiefs\u2019 special teams were nearly perfect, helping to keep the Cardinals (2-7) winless in six meetings at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely a grind out there,\u201d Hunt said, \u201cand definitely a team that was trying to come up big in a big-time win to get their program back on track, but most importantly we got the win.\u201d\n\nJosh Rosen had 195 yards passing with a touchdown, but two interceptions and several brutal hits in the fourth quarter no doubt left a lasting impression. David Johnson ran for 98 yards with TDs on the ground and through the air, while Larry Fitzgerald had six catches for 50 yards and passed Terrell Owens for No. 2 on the NFL\u2019s career receiving yardage list in the closing minutes.\n\nFitzgerald has 15,952 yards in 15-year career, trailing only Hall of Famer Jerry Rice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty close to T.O. His friendship and my relationship with him is valuable to me. He means a great deal to me,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that it comes in another loss.\u201d\n\nThe Chiefs\u2019 weekly air show got started on the game\u2019s first play, when Hill ran right past Patrick Peterson to haul in a 38-yard reception. Two plays later, Hill ran past the rest of the Arizona defense and Mahomes found him streaking into the end zone for a 37-yard scoring catch.\n\nArizona answered with a time-consuming 75-yard touchdown drive of its own.\n\nBoth defenses fared better the rest of the half, with the Cardinals sacking Mahomes four times and the Chiefs\u2019 rejuvenated defense getting enough pressure to keep Rosen uncomfortable.\n\nThe Chiefs finally reached the end zone again when Mahomes zipped a third-and-goal pass into double coverage to Hill, who cradled it for his quarterback\u2019s record-setting score.\n\n\u201cListen, he\u2019s had a heck of a year,\u201d Reid said of Mahomes, who was not available after the game because of a family emergency. \u201cHe\u2019s played his heart out and I love the backside of that, how he goes about his business. He has a lot on his plate as far as responsibility goes to run the offense.\u201d\n\nAs for Hill\u2019s touchdown celebration?\n\n\u201cThat was too much,\u201d Reid said, hiding a smile. \u201cI was not happy.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals stuck with Johnson in the second half, and they slowly grinded their way to another touchdown. He carried it six times and finished a 12-play, 61-yard drive with a TD plunge to get Arizona within 20-14 midway through the third quarter.\n\nBut after the Cardinals got the ball back early in the fourth, Rosen had a screen pass picked by Justin Houston at the line of scrimmage. And instead of marching for a go-ahead TD, the Cardinals watched Spencer Ware dive in for a touchdown to extend a lead the Chiefs would never relinquish.\n\n\u201cThought the guys fought to the end,\u201d Cardinals coach Steve Wilks said. \u201cThere are no moral victories in this game. All credit goes to Kansas City. Well-prepared, good football team.\u201d\n\nQUOTABLE\n\n\u201cI think we did a couple things really well. We\u2019ve just got to duplicate it. Our opening drives were pretty long and sustainable, and kept our defense off the field. We had pretty well-timed possessions. A little good nugget here and there, but some bad things to clean up.\u201d \u2014 Rosen.\n\nCOIN-TOSS LOSS\n\nThe Chiefs lost their first coin toss all season when the Cardinals successfully called tails. They deferred to the second half, forcing Kansas City to start on offense for the first time.\n\nINJURIES\n\nCardinals: WR Chad Williams (ankle), LG Mike Iupati (back) and DL Robert Nkemdichi (calf) were inactive. ... RG Justin Pugh left early in the second half with a knee injury.\n\nChiefs: WR Sammy Watkins (foot), SS Eric Berry (heel), LB Frank Zombo (hamstring) and OL Mitch Morse (concussion) were inactive. ... Houston (hamstring) was active for the first time since Oct. 7.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nArizona returns home to face the Raiders next Sunday.\n\nKansas City faces the Rams next Monday night in Mexico City.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(South Korea Presidential Blue House via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea has airlifted 200 tons of tangerines to North Korea in return for shipments of pine mushrooms by the North in September, officials said Monday.\n\nSouth Korean military planes flew to Pyongyang, North Korea\u2019s capital, on Sunday and Monday to deliver the fruit from the southern island of Jeju, according to Seoul\u2019s Defense Ministry. The airlifts are another sign that liberal South Korean President Moon Jae-in is moving ahead with efforts to improve ties with North Korea despite stalemated global diplomacy on the North\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nAfter a summit meeting between the Koreas in Pyongyang in September, North Korea gave South Korea 2 tons of pine mushrooms as a goodwill gesture. Pine mushrooms are white and brown fungi that are considered a healthy delicacy in both Koreas and other Asian countries. They are one of the North\u2019s most prized regional products, and the country shipped them to South Korea in 2000 and 2007 after previous summit talks.\n\nAfter their summit, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un also gave Moon a gift of two dogs, both white Pungsans. On Monday, Moon tweeted that one of the dogs, named Gomi, gave birth to six healthy puppies last Friday.\n\n\u201cSix dogs were added to a gift of two dogs. I cannot help saying it\u2019s a big fortune and I hope that South-North ties will be like this,\u201d Moon said.\n\nPungsan is a dog breed native to North Korea and is best known for its loyalty and bravery during hunting. North Korea sent a pair of Pungsans to South Korea after the 2000 summit, and South Korea gave two indigenous Jindo dogs to the North.\n\nDespite warming ties between the Koreas, there have been no major recent breakthroughs in U.S.-led diplomacy aimed at stripping North Korea of its nuclear program.\n\nAccording to officials in Seoul and Washington, North Korea recently postponed high-level talks with the United States on the North\u2019s disarmament and on setting up a second summit between President Donald Trump and Kim.\n\nAfter a provocative series of nuclear and missile tests last year, North Korea entered talks with the United States and South Korea this year, saying it\u2019s willing to deal away its growing nuclear weapons arsenal. The North has since taken measures such as dismantling its nuclear test site and parts of its rocket-engine testing facility, but U.S. officials want it to take more significant, irreversible steps toward denuclearization.\n\nMoon, who has met Kim three times this year, believes that better ties between the Koreas will help resolve the nuclear issue.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry said Monday it has approved a visit by seven North Koreans to attend an academic forum in the South later this week. The forum is on regional issues, including Japan\u2019s wartime mobilization of laborers in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nSeoul said Saturday that the two Koreas have finished withdrawing troops and firearms from some of their front-line guard posts as part of their agreements to lower military tensions. The Koreas have also halted military exercises along their border and have been clearing mines from a border area to conduct their first-ever joint searches for Korean War dead.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Trump is attending centennial commemorations in Paris this weekend to mark the Armistice that ended World War I. (Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press)\n\nPARIS \u2014 For President Donald Trump in Paris, America First meant largely America alone.\n\nAt a weekend commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, the president who proudly declares himself a \u201cnationalist\u201d stood apart, even on a continent where his brand of populism is on the rise.\n\nHe began his visit with a tweet slamming the French president\u2019s call for a European defense force, arrived at events alone and spent much of his trip out of sight in the American ambassadors\u2019 residence in central Paris. On Sunday, he listened as he was lectured on the dangers of nationalist isolation, and then he headed home just as the inaugural Paris Peace Summit was getting underway.\n\nBack at the White House on Monday, Trump tweeted that \u201cmuch was accomplished\u201d in his meetings, but voiced a familiar complaint about America\u2019s allies. He said the U.S. pays billions \u201cprotecting other countries, and we get nothing but Trade Deficits and Losses.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is time that these very rich countries either pay the United States for its great military protection, or protect themselves.\u201d\n\nHis France trip made clear that, nearly two years after taking office, Trump has dramatically upended decades of American foreign policy posture, shaking allies. That includes French President Emmanuel Macron, who on Sunday warned that the \u201cancient demons\u201d that caused World War I and millions of deaths were once again making headway.\n\nMacron, who has been urging a re-embrace of multinational organizations and cooperation that have been shunned by Trump, delivered a barely veiled rebuke of Trumpism at the weekend\u2019s centerpiece event: A gathering of dozens of leaders at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the base of the Arc de Triomphe to mark the passage of a century since the guns fell silent in a global war that killed millions. Bells tolled across Europe\u2019s Western Front and fighter jets passed overhead to mark the exact moment the devastating war came to a close.\n\nWith Trump and other leaders looking on, Macron took on the rising tide of populism in the United States and Europe and urged leaders not to turn their backs by turning inward.\n\n\u201cPatriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism: Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,\u201d Macron said, adding that, when nations put their interests first and decide \u201cwho cares about the others\u201d they \u201cerase the most precious thing a nation can have ... its moral values.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump was gone, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who recently announced that she will not be seeking re-election, made an impassioned plea for global cooperation at the peace forum, saying World War I had \u201cmade clear what disastrous consequences a lack of compromise in politics and diplomacy can have.\u201d\n\nTrump, who has made clear that he has limited patience for broad, multilateral agreements, sat mostly stone-faced as he listened to Macron, who sees himself as Europe\u2019s foil to the rising nationalist sentiment, which has taken hold in Hungary and Poland among other countries.\n\nTrump did engage with his fellow leaders, attending a group welcome dinner hosted by Macron at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay on Saturday night and a lunch on Sunday. He also spent time with Macron on Saturday, when the two stressed their shared desire for more burden-sharing during a quick availability with reporters.\n\nBut Trump was terse during some of his private conversations with world leaders, according to people with direct knowledge of his visit. One of the people described the president as \u201cgrumpy.\u201d They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations.\n\nThe symbolism during Trump\u2019s visit couldn\u2019t have been more stark.\n\nTrump was missing from one of the weekend\u2019s most powerful images: A line of world leaders, walking shoulder to-shoulder in a somber, rain-soaked procession as the bells marking the exact moment that fighting ended \u2014 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918 \u2014 finished tolling.\n\nThe president and first lady Melania Trump had traveled to the commemoration separately \u2014 White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited security protocols \u2014 from the other dignitaries, who had traveled together by bus from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s motorcade was making its solo trip down the grand Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, which was closed to traffic, at least one topless woman breached tight security, running into the street and shouting \u201cfake peace maker\u201d as the cars passed. She had slogans, including the words \u201cFake\u201d and \u201cPeace,\u201d written on her chest.\n\nPolice tackled the woman and the motorcade continued uninterrupted. The feminist activist group Femen later claimed responsibility.\n\nAlso traveling on his own was Russian President Vladimir Putin, who shook Trump\u2019s hand, flashed him a thumbs-up sign and patted Trump\u2019s arm as he arrived. Trump responded with a wide smile.\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton had said at one point that Putin and Trump would meet in Paris, but they will instead hold a formal sit-down later this month at a world leaders\u2019 summit in Buenos Aires. A Kremlin official said later that U.S. and Russian officials decided to drop plans for the Paris meeting after French officials objected.\n\nTrump, who ran on an \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform, has jarred European allies with his actions. He has slapped tariffs on the European Union, pulled the U.S. out of the landmark Paris Climate Accord and the Iran nuclear deal and suggested he might be willing to pull the U.S. out of NATO if member counties don\u2019t significantly boost their defense spending. Trump\u2019s eagerness to get along with the Russian leader \u2014 in spite of Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election and numerous other aggressive moves in recent years \u2014 has alarmed those who view Russia as a growing threat.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly branded himself a \u201cnationalist,\u201d despite criticism from some that the term has negative connotations. At a news conference last week, Trump defended his use of the phrase. \u201cYou know what the word is? I love our country,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cYou have nationalists. You have globalists. I also love the world and I don\u2019t mind helping the world, but we have to straighten out our country first. We have a lot of problems.\u201d\n\nBut Trump did not broach the divide as he paid tribute Sunday to U.S. and allied soldiers killed in World War I during \u201ca horrible, horrible war\u201d that marked America\u2019s emergence as a world power.\n\n\u201cWe are gathered together at this hallowed resting place to pay tribute to the brave Americans who gave their last breath in that mighty struggle,\u201d Trump said at the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial in the suburbs of Paris, where more than 1,500 Americans who died in the war are buried.\n\n\u201cIt is our duty to preserve the civilization they defended and to protect the peace they so nobly gave their lives to secure one century ago,\u201d he said after spending a moment, standing alone amid the cemetery\u2019s white crosses, holding a black umbrella.\n\nThe Veterans Day speech came a day after Trump was criticized for failing to visit a different American cemetery about 60 miles (100 kilometers) outside of Paris on Saturday because rain grounded the helicopter he had planned to take. A handful of senior administration officials, including White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, went in the president\u2019s place, while Trump remained behind at the ambassador\u2019s residence with no alternate schedule for hours.\n\nTrump delivered the speech as other leaders were gathered for the Paris Peace Forum, which aims to revive collective governance and international cooperation to tackle global challenges. Afterward he flew back to Washington.\n\nFrance was the epicenter of World War I, the first global conflict. Its role as host of the main international commemoration highlighted the point that the world mustn\u2019t stumble into war again, as it did so quickly and catastrophically with World War II.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Robert Burns and Julie Pace in Washington and Lori Hinnant and Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press\u2019 WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___\n\nFollow Superville and Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/dsupervilleap and https://twitter.com/colvinj\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Sister came along as well. When I was making my next appointment, she wrote it down as if she planned to attend.\n\nAt first, I just said neutral things such as, \"Thanks for the tip/article, we will consider it.\" But now she contacts me daily about the baby and made it clear she expects to be in the delivery room.

Shopping carts are called \u201ctrolleys\u201d in Australia.\n\n\u201cOur hero is humble as can be and had no idea about this fundraiser,\u201d the GoFundMe page reads. \u201cHe is amazing. We believe his efforts deserve a reward that can really help him out.\u201d\n\nIn interviews with Australian media, Rogers, 46, has insisted he\u2019s no hero. \u201cI threw the trolley straight at him, and I got him. I didn\u2019t quite get him down, though. I\u2019m no hero,\u201d he told Channel Seven.\n\nHe also told Melbourne\u2019s Age newspaper he had been on the wrong side of the law himself. The paper reported he had been \u201cin and out of jail\u201d for some 20 years, including a five-year sentence for aggravated burglary, and that he\u2019d had a long history of drug use.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had good experiences with police,\u201d Rogers told the paper, adding that his move to help on Friday was a \u201cspur of the moment\u201d decision.\n\nSomali-born Australian Hassain Khalif Shire Ali, 30, stabbed three men on the street in Friday\u2019s attack, killing a well-known restaurateur and wounding two other men.\n\nWell-known cafe owner Sisto Malaspina, 74, died a short distance from the popular Pellegrini\u2019s Espresso Bar he had run for more than 40 years. In a mark of his community renown, Malaspina will be given a state funeral next week. The other two men are recovering in a hospital from non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nVictoria state Police Commissioner Graham Ashton said Shire Ali had also made an \u201cunsophisticated\u201d plan for his vehicle to explode to cause many more fatalities. He had placed several barbecue gas canisters in his pickup, but they failed to ignite.\n\nShire Ali was known to federal police and his Australian passport was canceled in 2015 out of concern that he planned to travel to Syria to fight with the Islamic State group.\n\nWhile Rogers won praise from the community, senior Victorian police officials were divided in their reaction.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Shane Patton said Rogers\u2019 help was appreciated by police on the scene. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt he acted bravely,\u201d he told ABC radio. \u201cHis assistance was greatly appreciated.\u201d\n\nBut later, Patton\u2019s superior, Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton, said that Rogers\u2019 actions could have led to a tragic outcome.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to criticize people in that situation, he\u2019s acting instinctively about what he\u2019s looking at in front of him,\u201d Ashton told Melbourne radio 3AW. \u201cBut certainly if a trolley had hit a police member and knocked him over and then this offender was on top of him, it could have had a tragic consequence. Luckily in this case, it didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nVictorian Premier Daniel Andrews confirmed Monday that Malaspina would be honored with a state funeral, and that renaming a laneway near his cafe after him was also under consideration.\n\n\u201cSisto Malaspina was a Victorian icon, known and loved by us all,\u201d Andrews tweeted. \u201cI spoke to his family again this morning, and they have accepted my offer of a state funeral next week, with more details to come.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Hau Dinh, File/Associated Press)\n\nBEIJING \u2014 A look at recent developments in the South China Sea, where China is pitted against smaller neighbors in multiple disputes over islands, coral reefs and lagoons in waters crucial for global commerce and rich in fish and potential oil and gas reserves:\n\n___\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This is a weekly look at the latest developments in the South China Sea, the location of several territorial conflicts that have raised tensions in the region.\n\n___\n\nCHINA DEMANDS END TO US OPERATIONS\n\nChina has demanded the United States stop sending ships and military aircraft close to its South China Sea island claims during talks to prepare for a meeting between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping.\n\nThe U.S. pushed back Friday, insisting it will continue to \u201cfly, sail and operate wherever international law allows.\u201d In late September, U.S. and Chinese vessels nearly collided close to a disputed reef.\n\nTensions have also flared amid a bitter trade dispute that Trump and Xi are expected to tackle at the Group of 20 summit in Argentina later this month.\n\nThe talks were scheduled to be held in Beijing last month but were postponed after Washington announced new arms sales to Taiwan, and after a Chinese destroyer came close to the USS Decatur in late September in what the U.S. Navy called an \u201cunsafe and unprofessional maneuver.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Chinese side made it clear to the United States that it should stop sending its vessels and military aircraft close to Chinese islands and reefs and stop actions that undermine Chinese authority and security interests,\u201d said Chinese senior foreign policy adviser, Yang Jiechi, who also had sharp words over U.S. support for Taiwan.\n\nHowever, Yang and Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe also spoke of the need to improve cooperation, including between the U.S. and Chinese militaries, to ease the risk of conflict as the two powers jockey for pre-eminence in the Asia-Pacific.\n\n___\n\nVIETNAM PROTESTS CHINESE WEATHER STATIONS\n\nVietnam has protested China\u2019s launch of weather stations in the disputed Spratly islands, saying they violate Vietnam\u2019s sovereignty and complicate the situation in the South China Sea.\n\nChina last week announced it started operations of the stations on three islands to offer weather forecasts to fishermen in the South China Sea region, neighboring countries and passing ships.\n\nVietnamese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang told reporters at a regularly scheduled briefing Thursday that Vietnam has the legal basis and historical evidence to assert its sovereignty over the Spratlys and Paracels and asked China to stop the action.\n\nThe Chinese stations are built on man-made islands constructed atop coral reefs that also have airstrips, radar stations and other military features.\n\n\u201cThe fact that China started use of meteorological observation stations on the illegally built structures in the Spratlys has seriously violated Vietnam\u2019s sovereignty over the islands,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cVietnam persistently opposes this act and asks China to immediately stop the above-said actions,\u201d she said.\n\nHang said China should abide by the principles reached between the two countries guiding the settlement of the maritime issues and the Declaration of the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea \u201cwithout complicating the situation, affecting peace, security and stability\u201d in the South China Sea.\n\n___\n\nCHINESE SHIP GREETS JAPANESE VESSEL\n\nDespite Beijing\u2019s strenuous objections to \u201coutside parties\u201d becoming involved in the South China Sea, a Chinese warship sent friendly greetings to a Japanese navy vessel as part of an overall improvement in relations between the regional rivals.\n\nJapanese state broadcaster NHK reported last week that the message was sent in later October from the Chinese destroyer Lanzhou to the Japanese helicopter carrier Kaga.\n\n\u201cGood morning, glad to see you,\u201d NHK quoted the Chinese message as saying.\n\nChina frequently evokes memories of Japan\u2019s brutal World War II invasion and occupation of much of its territory to warn of what it calls the threat of resurgent Japanese militarism. China is also a strong critic of the U.S.-Japanese defense alliance and opposes all actions by their two militaries seen as challenging its claim to almost the entire South China Sea.\n\nHowever, trade friction with the U.S. appears to be drawing the two closer, with Chinese President Xi Jinping telling Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last month that the two countries are \u201csharing more common interests and concerns.\u201d\n\nChina-Japan relations have undergone turbulence but are now \u201cback to a normal track,\u201d Xi told Abe during the first formal visit to Beijing by a Japanese leader in nearly seven years.\n\nAbe\u2019s visit highlights the improvement in ties after they hit a low in 2012 during a dispute over East China Sea islands controlled by Japan but claimed by China.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Mathew Pennington in Washington and Tran Van Minh in Hanoi, Vietnam contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The airlifts are another sign that liberal South Korean President Moon Jae-in is moving ahead with efforts to improve ties with North Korea despite stalemated global diplomacy on the North\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nAfter a summit meeting between the Koreas in Pyongyang in September, North Korea gave South Korea 2 tons of pine mushrooms as a goodwill gesture. Pine mushrooms are white and brown fungi that are considered a healthy delicacy in both Koreas and other Asian countries. They are one of the North\u2019s most prized regional products, and the country shipped them to South Korea in 2000 and 2007 after previous summit talks.\n\nAfter their summit, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un also gave Moon a gift of two dogs, both white Pungsans.

I cannot help saying it\u2019s a big fortune and I hope that South-North ties will be like this,\u201d Moon said.\n\nPungsan is a dog breed native to North Korea and is best known for its loyalty and bravery during hunting. North Korea sent a pair of Pungsans to South Korea after the 2000 summit, and South Korea gave two indigenous Jindo dogs to the North.\n\nDespite warming ties between the Koreas, there have been no major recent breakthroughs in U.S.-led diplomacy aimed at stripping North Korea of its nuclear program.\n\nAccording to officials in Seoul and Washington, North Korea recently postponed high-level talks with the United States on the North\u2019s disarmament and on setting up a second summit between President Donald Trump and Kim.\n\nAfter a provocative series of nuclear and missile tests last year, North Korea entered talks with the United States and South Korea this year, saying it\u2019s willing to deal away its growing nuclear weapons arsenal. The North has since taken measures such as dismantling its nuclear test site and parts of its rocket-engine testing facility, but U.S. officials want it to take more significant, irreversible steps toward denuclearization.\n\nMoon, who has met Kim three times this year, believes that better ties between the Koreas will help resolve the nuclear issue.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry said Monday it has approved a visit by seven North Koreans to attend an academic forum in the South later this week. The forum is on regional issues, including Japan\u2019s wartime mobilization of laborers in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nSeoul said Saturday that the two Koreas have finished withdrawing troops and firearms from some of their front-line guard posts as part of their agreements to lower military tensions. The Koreas have also halted military exercises along their border and have been clearing mines from a border area to conduct their first-ever joint searches for Korean War dead.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Twenty years after his father almost bargained them away for a pair of nuclear reactors, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has his nuclear weapons - and a nation still plagued by chronic blackouts. But years of sanctions have spurred the North to cobble together a creative smorgasbord of alternative resources, some off the official grid and some flat-out illegal. (Dita Alangkara/Associated Press)\n\nPYONGYANG, North Korea \u2014 More than 20 years after his father almost bargained them away for a pair of nuclear reactors, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has his nuclear weapons \u2014 and a nation still plagued by chronic blackouts.\n\nEven on the clearest days, plumes of smoke from two towering chimneys linger over the center of Pyongyang. The Soviet-era Pyongyang Combined Heat and Power Plant smokestacks are one of the North Korean capital\u2019s most recognizable landmarks.\n\nPossibly more than anything else, this is Kim Jong Un\u2019s Achilles heel as he turns his attention from developing the country\u2019s nuclear weapons arsenal to building its economy.\n\nIf stalled nuclear talks with Washington ever get back on track, helping Kim solve his country\u2019s chronic energy deficit could be one of the biggest carrots President Trump has to offer. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo tried that back in the 1990s, and were even ready to pay for and build those two reactors Kim\u2019s father wanted.\n\nYears of intensive sanctions have severely impacted North Korea\u2019s supply of fossil fuels from the outside world, but they also have spurred the country to cobble together a smorgasbord of energy resources, some of them off the grid and some of them flat-out illegal.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at where Kim stands and what he is doing to win his country\u2019s real struggle for power.\n\n___\n\nTHE BIG PICTURE\n\nAmong the most iconic images of North Korea are nighttime satellite photos that reveal it as an inky abyss ringed by the bright lights of China, South Korea and Japan.\n\nThe whole nation of 25 million uses about the same amount of electricity each year as Washington, D.C. It uses as much crude oil in a year as the U.S. consumes in just 12 hours. South Korea has about twice the population of the North, but its electricity consumption in 2014 was about 40 times bigger.\n\nHydroelectricity, which is subject to seasonal swings, provides about half of the fuel supplied to the national energy grid. Coal accounts for the other half.\n\nThe grid is leaky, archaic and badly needing repairs.\n\nThat smoke-spewing power plant in the capital, which supplies much of the power and hot water needs for central Pyongyang, dates back to the 1960s. Lights in the huge concrete apartment blocks of Tongil Boulevard across town stay lit thanks largely to the East Pyongyang Thermal Power Station \u2014 built by the Soviet Union in the 1980s.\n\nWhat electricity there is is unevenly distributed.\n\nThe showcase capital and cities near coal or hydroelectric power plants get the best coverage. Military facilities also take precedence and often have their own supply. So do important party and government operations, some of the higher-profile residences and hotels in the capital and even some restaurants. Lights used to illuminate portraits of the leaders at night never go out.\n\nStill, it\u2019s not uncommon for the power even in many higher status locations to flicker on and off. Dancing beams of flashlights are commonplace on the streets or in otherwise darkened apartments. In rural villages, even that often fades to black.\n\n___\n\nKEEPING THE OIL FLOWING ...\n\nNorth Korea must import about 3-4 million barrels of crude oil each year to sustain its economy.\n\nMost of it flows through one pipeline.\n\nThe China-North Korea \u201cFriendship Oil Pipeline\u201d runs from the border city of Dandong under the Yalu River to a storage facility on the North Korean side about 13 kilometers (10 miles) outside the city of Sinuiju. From there, some is sent across country by truck or rail to the east coast, where it is stored at the port of Munchon. More is transported to Pyongyang for priority recipients such as the military, government departments and state enterprises, and to the port of Nampo, southwest of Pyongyang.\n\nThe pipeline \u2014technically there are two, one for crude and the other for refined products \u2014 was built between 1974 and 1976.\n\nNorth Korea used to have two refineries. The pipeline from China terminates at the Ponghwa Chemical Factory, which produces gasoline and diesel. The other refinery was built by the Soviet Union in the north near the Rason Special Economic Zone in the 1970s. It shut down in 1995 with the collapse of the Soviet empire. The pipeline that connected it with Siberia has long been out of use.\n\nUnder U.N. sanctions imposed late last year, North Korea can import a maximum 500,000 barrels of refined oil products along with 4 million barrels of crude oil per year.\n\nAlong with its Chinese connection, the North has been supplied by Russian tankers that ship oil and petroleum products to Munchon and another east coast port, Hungnam. It has found willing suppliers in the Middle East, or on the open market.\n\nSince the imposition of the import cap, Pyongyang has been implicated in increasingly sophisticated schemes to augment its supplies with hard-to-track transfers of oil by tankers at sea.\n\nWashington\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, told the Security Council in September the United States tracked at least 148 instances of oil tankers delivering refined petroleum products obtained through illegal ship-to-ship transfers in the first eight months of this year. She claimed the amount of illegally transferred oil \u2014 about 800,000 barrels \u2014 was 160 percent of the annual 500,000 barrel cap.\n\n\u201cIn reality, we think they have obtained four times the annual quota in the first eight months of this year,\u201d Haley said.\n\n___\n\n... AND GOING OFF THE GRID\n\nDavid von Hippel and Peter Hayes of the Nautilus Institute have been following North Korea\u2019s energy issue for years.\n\nComparing Chinese trade figures from 2000 through 2017, they found explosive growth in North Korea\u2019s imports of passenger cars and trucks that put an additional 107,000 vehicles on its roads. Tractor sales also rose and sales of \u201celectricity propelled\u201d bicycles or scooters, a category that wasn\u2019t even listed until last year, doubled to 128,000.\n\nThe truck and tractor sales almost certainly reflect an upgrade to the North\u2019s transportation and agricultural sectors. Being able to get around is a key to doing business in a market-centric economy, and so is having enough spending power to buy things like electric scooters.\n\nMoreover, in a study released this month, Hayes and von Hippel also found that imports of diesel- and gasoline-powered generators, coupled with solar panels that are already ubiquitous in the North, are creating an energy system increasingly independent of the national power grid.\n\n\u201cThe data ... reinforces a picture of a DPRK in which a more vibrant, modernizing, increasingly (at least functionally) market-based economy is providing households, business and institutions with the wherewithal to invest in both off-grid electricity supplies and increased transport services,\u201d they wrote, using the acronym for the North\u2019s official name.\n\nStill, keeping the power on often can be an elaborate routine.\n\nSolar panels, the cheapest option, can keep a room lit, a mobile phone working and maybe a TV or another appliance going. When electricity from the grid is actually flowing, it can be used to charge batteries before the next blackout hits.\n\nThose with a little more clout or money use diesel- or gas-powered generators that can power anything from a restaurant to an apartment block.\n\nOr a military installation.\n\n___\n\nTalmadge is the AP\u2019s Pyongyang bureau chief.

Several thousand Central American migrants marked a month on the road Monday as they hitched rides toward the western Mexico city of Guadalajara. (Marco Ugarte/Associated Press)\n\nGUADALAJARA, Mexico \u2014 Several thousand Central American migrants heading for the U.S. border arrived in the western Mexico city of Guadalajara with help from truckers and other motorists Monday, marking a month since their trek began.\n\nMany of the migrants boarded waiting buses at the Jalisco state line that carried them to a shelter prepared for them in the city\u2019s Benito Juarez Auditorium. Guadalajara municipal police shuttled others in patrol vehicles.\n\nThe migrants are mostly families from Honduras. At the shelter, officials had the migrants form two lines \u2014 one for families and one for men traveling alone. They were offered food and told where to go for donated clothing and free internet to contact their families.\n\nMost appear intent on taking the Pacific coast route northward to the border city of Tijuana, which is still about 1,550 miles (2,500 kilometers) away. The migrants have come about 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) since they started out in Honduras around Oct. 13.\n\nWhile they previously suffered from the heat on their journey through Honduras, Guatemala and southern Mexico, they now trek along highways wrapped in blankets to fend off the morning chill.\n\nKaren Martinez of Copan, Honduras, and her three children bundled up with jackets, scarves and a blanket.\n\n\u201cSometimes we go along laughing, sometimes crying, but we keep on going,\u201d she said.\n\nBy late afternoon, the first migrants arrived on the outskirts of Guadalajara.\n\nWhile the caravan previously averaged only about 30 miles (50 kilometers) a day, the migrants are now covering daily distances of 185 miles (300 kilometers) or more, partly because they are relying on hitchhiking rather than walking.\n\nOn Monday morning, migrants gathered on a highway leading out of the central city of Irapuato looking for rides to Guadalajara about 150 miles (242 kilometers) away.\n\n\u201cNow the route is less complicated,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nIndeed, migrants have hopped aboard so many different kinds of trucks that they are no longer surprised by anything. Some have stacked themselves four levels high on a truck intended for pigs. On Monday, a few boarded a truck carrying a shipment of coffins, while yet others squeezed into a truck with narrow cages used for transporting chickens.\n\nMany, especially men, travel on open platform trailers used to transport steel and cars, or get in the freight containers of 18-wheelers and ride with one of the back doors open to provide air flow.\n\nThe practice is not without dangers. Earlier, a Honduran man in the caravan died when he fell from a platform truck in the Mexican state of Chiapas.\n\nJose Alejandro Caray, 17, of Yoro, Honduras, fell a week ago and injured his knee.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t bend it,\u201d Caray said as he watched other migrants swarm aboard tractor-trailers.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m afraid to get on,\u201d he said. \u201cI prefer to wait for a pickup truck.\u201d\n\nAfter several groups got lost after clambering on semi-trailers, caravan coordinators began encouraging migrants to ask drivers first or have someone ride in the cab so they could tell the driver where to turn off.\n\nOver the weekend, the central state of Queretaro reported 6,531 migrants moving through the state. Another group was farther behind and was arriving in Mexico City on Monday.\n\nThe caravan became a campaign issue in U.S. midterm elections and U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of over 5,000 military troops to the border to fend off the migrants. Trump has insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\n\nMany say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.\n\nMexico has offered refuge, asylum or work visas, and its government said 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them during the 45-day application process for more permanent status.\n\nBut most migrants vow to continue to the United States.\n\nJose Tulio Rodriguez, 30, of Siguatepeque, Honduras, celebrated his 30th birthday at a migrant shelter in Mexico City last week before setting out with the rest of the caravan.\n\n\u201cThe distance between cities is longer\u201d than it was at the start, Rodriguez noted,\u201d but thanks to the people of Mexico, we haven\u2019t suffered.\u201d\n\nThose distances will get longer the farther they travel into northern Mexico, where towns of any size are often 250 miles (400 kilometers) apart.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The crowd demanded the restoration of democracy after President Maithripala Sirisena dissolved Parliament and called for fresh elections. (Eranga Jayawardena/Associated Press)\n\nCOLOMBO, Sri Lanka \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s president said he dissolved Parliament and called elections to avoid possible violence inside Parliament and around the country if a vote had to be taken to decide whether his chosen prime minister or his sacked rival had the majority support.\n\nIn a televised address to the nation Sunday evening, President Maithripala Sirisena said he heard stories from lawmakers on both sides of possible violence in Parliament that could even result in deaths and clashes spreading around the country.\n\n\u201cIt appeared to me that, if I allowed the Parliament to be convened on the 14th, without dissolving it, it could have brought about commotion and fights in every city and every village would lead to very unpleasant and difficult situation for the average citizens of my beloved country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs such, the best solution was not to allow those 225 members in the Parliament to fight each other and allow that to develop into a street fights in every part of the country. It is my duty and the responsibility to ... create the situation for the 15 million voters in this country takes the ultimate decision by choosing their members to the Parliament through a free and fair election.\u201d\n\nThe U.N. and foreign governments have expressed concerns over Sirisena\u2019s decision to dissolve Parliament on Friday and his earlier sacking of Ranil Wickremesinghe, who he replaced with former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa. Wickremesinghe says his sacking is unconstitutional and that he still has a majority support in Parliament.\n\nSirisena initially suspended Parliament until Nov. 16, delaying the possibility of testing the majority. He then dissolved it after being unable to secure support for Rajapaksa and called for elections to take place on Jan. 5. Several political parties have said they will petition the Supreme Court on Monday seeking to nullify Parliament\u2019s dissolution.\n\nA statement from U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019s office recently expressed concern.\n\n\u201cThe Secretary-General underlines the utmost importance of respecting democratic processes and institutions and resolving differences in accordance with the rule of law and due process,\u201d his deputy spokesman, Farhan Haq, said.\n\nIn his address to the nation, Sirisena also appeared to issue a warning about Wickremesinghe remaining in the official residence of the prime minister.\n\nHe said only his new prime minister and Cabinet ministers were entitled to use state vehicles and assets at a time of transition and said he will deploy police to take over state assets and take legal action against violators if those assets were not surrendered.\n\nSirisena and Wickremesinghe, who were leading traditionally opposed parties, were part of an awkward coalition government until Wickremesinghe\u2019s sacking on Oct. 26.\n\nTensions had been building for some time between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe, who had introduced economic reforms the president did not approve. Sirisena has also accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, an accusation Wickremesinghe has repeatedly denied.\n\nSirisena also has criticized investigations into military personnel accused of human rights violations during Sri Lanka\u2019s long civil war against a Tamil separatist group, which ended in 2009. Rajapaksa, who ruled as president from 2005 to 2015, is considered a hero by the ethnic Sinhalese majority for winning the conflict. But he lost a re-election bid in 2015 amid accusations of nepotism, corruption and wartime atrocities.\n\nRajapaksa on Sunday left his longtime political party and joined another, in a move that could weaken Sirisena.\n\nRajapaksa joined the Sri Lanka People\u2019s Front, a party of which he was shadow leader for months. A large number of members of Sirisena\u2019s Sri Lanka Freedom Party, are likely to join Rajapaksa because he has the biggest following among them.\n\nHowever, both Rajapaksa and Sirisena have said they will face the Jan. 5 election together.\n\nHundreds of people gathered in Colombo, Sri Lanka\u2019s capital, on Sunday for a candle light vigil protesting what they purported an unconstitutional dissolution of parliament.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Armistice Day, 100 years after the end of the First World War, France, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018. (Christian Hartmann/Pool Photo via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nPARIS \u2014 The Latest on President Donald Trump\u2019s trip to Paris. (all times local):\n\n11:30 p.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump paid tribute to U.S. and allied soldiers killed in World War I during what he called \u201ca horrible, horrible war\u201d that marked America\u2019s emergence as a world power.\n\nTrump made his comments Sunday at the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial in the suburbs of Paris, where more than 1,500 Americans who died in the war are buried. He said that world leaders \u201care gathered together at this hallowed resting place to pay tribute to the brave Americans\u201d who gave their lives in that war.\n\nTrump said: \u201cIt is our duty to preserve the civilization they defended and to protect the peace they so nobly gave their lives to secure one century ago.\u201d He made the comments after spending a moment standing alone amid the cemetery\u2019s white crosses.\n\n___\n\n6:16 p.m.\n\nA top Kremlin foreign affairs aide says the French government requested that President Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump back away from plans to meet during their Paris visit.\n\nWhether the U.S. and Russian presidents would meet on the sidelines of the ceremonies commemorating the end of World War I had been a subject of speculation in the lead-up to Sunday\u2019s events.\n\nYuri Ushakov, Putin\u2019s foreign affairs adviser, said on Russian state television that a preliminary agreement on a Trump-Putin meeting had been reached but was dropped after taking into account what he called French considerations. He said this decision was made in consultation with American officials.\n\n___\n\n4:15 p.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump says victory came at a \u201cterrible cost\u201d to allied forces that fought and died in World War I.\n\nTrump said that 26,000 Americans were killed in just the last battle of the war alone.\n\nTrump spoke during a WWI centennial at the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial where more than 1,500 U.S. military servicemen are buried.\n\nHe says it\u2019s the duty of today\u2019s generation to defend the peace they nobly gave with their lives.\n\nTrump introduced six American veterans of the Second World War and an U.S. eighth-grader who saved money for two years so he could attend the ceremony to honor the heroes of WWI.\n\n___\n\n4:10 p.m.\n\nThe \u201cBaby Trump\u201d balloon is back, hovering over a demonstration of several hundred people in eastern Paris.\n\nThe main message of the anti-Trump protest was to speak out against the president and what he stands for to those who oppose his \u201cAmerica first\u201d message and policies.\n\nTrump is in Paris to mark Sunday\u2019s centennial of the end of World War I.\n\nThe protest, held in steady rain, drew a range of groups and causes from Trotskyists to Communists and some seeking to free a convicted Lebanese terrorist from jail.\n\n___\n\n3:30 p.m.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin says he didn\u2019t have a separate meeting with President Donald Trump at events in Paris marking the end of World War I, but says they will meet on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Argentina later this month.\n\nPutin said he and Trump decided \u201cnot to interrupt the schedule\u201d of the World War I events with a separate meeting.

(Mark Zaleski/Associated Press)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Tom Brady added another big chunk of NFL history to his resume. The Tennessee Titans made sure the Patriots quarterback didn\u2019t finish his 300th game.\n\nThe Titans sacked Brady three times and hit him repeatedly as they beat New England 34-10 Sunday, snapping a seven-game skid against the Patriots in Mike Vrabel\u2019s first game as head coach against the team he helped win three Super Bowls.\n\nIt was the most sacks allowed in a game this season by the Patriots (7-3), and coach Bill Belichick pulled Brady for Brian Hoyer midway through the fourth quarter.\n\nOnly Brett Favre (326) has played in more games, both regular season and postseason, as a quarterback than Brady. The three-time NFL MVP also needed only three touchdown passes to tie Peyton Manning (579) for the NFL record for most TD passes all time for both the regular season and postseason. He left having thrown for 254 yards and no TD passes.\n\nMarcus Mariota capped each of the first two drives with TD passes, and Derrick Henry ran for a pair of TDs. Ryan Succop also added two field goals as the Titans (5-4) scored a season high in points after jumping to a 17-3 lead in the first quarter. They now have beaten both of last season\u2019s Super Bowl teams in Nashville.\n\nThe loss snaps a six-game winning streak going into New England\u2019s bye. The Patriots, who routed the Titans 35-14 in January, also lost to Tennessee for the first time since Dec. 16, 2002.\n\nSAINTS 51, BENGALS 14\n\nCINCINNATI \u2014 Drew Brees threw three touchdown passes in the first half, moving ahead of Brett Favre for second place on the career list, and the Saints rolled to their eighth straight victory.\n\nBrees led the Saints to touchdowns on all five first-half possessions with a nearly perfect performance \u2014 only two incompletions. His 17-yard TD to Michael Thomas with 2 seconds left in the half gave him 509 career touchdown passes, one more than Favre.\n\nUp next: Peyton Manning\u2019s record 539.\n\nBrees had his way with the Bengals\u2019 historically bad defense , even diving over the pile to score a 1-yard touchdown. Cincinnati (5-4) became the first team in the Super Bowl era to give up 500 yards in three consecutive games; New Orleans finished with 509.\n\nThe Bengals matched the most lopsided defeat in franchise history and gave up the second-most points in club history. In the first half alone, the Saints piled up 311 yards and had 21 first downs on 40 plays. Brees was 18 of 20 for 214 yards with three touchdowns.\n\nMark Ingram and Alvin Kamara recognized Dez Bryant by crossing their arms after scoring touchdowns. The former Cowboys receiver signed with the Saints on Wednesday but tore an Achilles tendon in his second practice.\n\nCHIEFS 26, CARDINALS 14\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014 Patrick Mahomes threw for 249 yards and two touchdowns, outplaying Arizona counterpart Josh Rosen in a matchup of two of the NFL\u2019s bright young quarterbacks.\n\nMahomes threw both TD passes to Tyreek Hill, the second giving the Chiefs\u2019 first-year starter 31 for the season. That broke the franchise record set by Len Dawson in 1964 \u2014 with plenty of games to go.\n\nNot to mention the playoffs, with the Chiefs (9-1) barreling toward the No. 1 seed.\n\nRosen had 195 yards passing with a touchdown and two picks, taking several brutal hits in the fourth quarter. David Johnson ran for 98 yards, with TDs on the ground and through the air, while Larry Fitzgerald passed Terrell Owens for No. 2 on the NFL\u2019s career receiving yardage list late in the game.\n\nFitzgerald finished with six catches for 50 yards to give him 15,952 for his brilliant career.\n\nHill had seven catches for 117 yards, and Kareem Hunt pounded his way for 71 yards rushing, as the Chiefs kept the Cardinals (2-7) winless in six meetings at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nCOWBOYS 27, EAGLES 20\n\nPHILADELPHIA \u2014 Ezekiel Elliott had 151 yards rushing and the go-ahead 1-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter in Dallas\u2019 victory over Philadelphia.\n\nThe defending Super Bowl champion Eagles fell to 4-5 with their third straight loss at home while the Cowboys improved to 4-5.\n\nDak Prescott had 270 yards passing with a touchdown and also ran for a score. Elliott also had a scoring reception.\n\nCarson Wentz threw a pair of TD passes to Zach Ertz, but his pass to Ertz on fourth down fell a yard short of a first down at the Cowboys 29 with 1:09 left. The Eagles got the ball back at their 32 with 40 seconds left and drove to the Cowboys 32 for the final play. Wentz completed a pass to Ertz inside the Dallas 10. Ertz lateraled to Golden Tate, but he was tackled to end it.\n\nPACKERS 31, DOLPHINS 12\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. \u2014 Aaron Jones ran for career highs of 145 yards and two scores, Aaron Rodgers and Davante Adams connected for two touchdown passes.\n\nThe Packers (4-4-1) pulled away in the second half, sandwiching scoring drives around cornerback Bashaud Breeland\u2019s interception deep in Miami territory. Green Bay went ahead 28-12 on Adams\u2019 25-yard touchdown catch with 7:24 left in the third quarter.\n\nMaybe this is the game that will get the Packers going in the tight NFC North race following a choppy first half of the season.\n\nRookie Jason Sanders tied a Dolphins franchise record with four field goals, but Miami (5-5) couldn\u2019t find the end zone. The Dolphins squandered another opportunity on the game-opening drive after Brock Osweiler fumbled away a shotgun snap.\n\nCHARGERS 20, RAIDERS 6\n\nOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Philip Rivers threw two touchdown passes, Melvin Gordon gained 165 yards and the Chargers won their sixth straight game.\n\nRivers bounced back from a first quarter with no completions to throw an 11-yard TD pass to Keenan Allen in the second quarter to give the Chargers (7-2) the lead for good. He hit a 66-yarder to Gordon on the opening drive of the second half.\n\nLos Angeles coasted from there against the Raiders (1-8), who have lost five straight games by at least 14 points under coach Jon Gruden. They and have been outscored 75-9 in the past nine quarters in what has quickly become a lost season.\n\nOakland started quickly by controlling the ball for 23 of 29 plays in the first quarter and outgaining the Chargers by 129 yards. But Los Angeles allowed little after Melvin Ingram forced a fumble on a sack of Derek Carr early in the second quarter with the Raiders looking to add to a 3-0 lead.\n\nRivers found his stride after that.\n\nRAMS 36, SEAHAWKS 31\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Brandin Cooks rushed for a 9-yard touchdown on the first snap after Dante Fowler forced and recovered a fumble by Russell Wilson, and the Rams bounced back from their first loss of the season.\n\nJared Goff passed for 318 yards and two touchdowns, and Todd Gurley rushed for 120 yards and a score as the Rams (9-1) swept the season series with their division rivals.\n\nLos Angeles moved into commanding position for its second consecutive NFC West title, but only after plenty of late drama in a rivalry that\u2019s never lacking in excitement.\n\nWilson threw three touchdown passes, rushed for 92 yards and nearly rallied the Seahawks (4-5) all the way back after his fumble.\n\nHe hit Mike Davis for a short TD catch to cap a 90-yard drive with 1:56 to play. After the Seattle defense held, he got the Seahawks to the Los Angeles 35 before throwing four straight incompletions in the final minute.\n\nBROWNS 28, FALCONS 16\n\nCLEVELAND \u2014 Rookie Baker Mayfield threw a season-high three touchdown passes and rookie Nick Chubb streaked 92 yards for a TD as Cleveland ended a four-game losing streak.\n\nThe Browns (3-6-1) played their most complete game this season under interim coach Gregg Williams, their defensive coordinator who improved to 1-1 since replacing the fired Hue Jackson.\n\nMayfield outplayed Falcons star quarterback Matt Ryan with a performance that further justifies Cleveland\u2019s decision to take the QB with the No. 1 overall pick in this year\u2019s draft. Mayfield completed his first 13 passes and finished 17 of 20 for 216 yards. He threw a 28-yard scoring pass to Rashard Higgins, a 13-yarder to Chubb, and 11-yarder to Duke Johnson.\n\nRyan and the Falcons (4-5) had their three-game winning streak \u2014 and any playoff momentum \u2014 stopped cold.\n\nAnd while Mayfield did damage, Chubb\u2019s record run was the backbreaker.\n\nWith the Browns backed up at their 8, Chubb, who had 176 yards on 20 carries, took a handoff and headed right. He cut toward Atlanta\u2019s sideline, picked up a block and then showed his surprising breakaway speed while finishing the longest run in team history. Chubb\u2019s run broke the previous team mark held by Bobby Mitchell, who had a 90-yard TD run against Washington on Nov. 15, 1959.\n\nBEARS 34, LIONS 22\n\nCHICAGO \u2014 Mitchell Trubisky threw for 355 yards and three touchdowns, and the NFC North-leading Bears snapped a 10-game losing streak against division opponents.\n\nThe Bears (6-3) had dropped nine of 10 against Detroit (3-6) and were seeking their first victory over a division opponent since Oct. 31, 2016, against Minnesota.\n\nChicago jumped to a 26-7 halftime lead with Trubisky and Allen Robinson leading the way. And the Bears surpassed their win total from last year with their third straight victory.\n\nTrubisky completed 23 of 30 passes against a short-handed secondary, with standout cornerback Darius Slay sidelined by a knee injury.\n\nAllen Robinson caught six passes for 133 yards and two TDs after missing two games with a groin injury.\n\nRookie Anthony Miller added a career-high 122 yards on five receptions, including a 45-yard TD and a 55-yard catch.\n\nKhalil Mack had two of Chicago\u2019s six sacks against Matthew Stafford \u2014 both in the second half after missing back-to-back games with an injured right ankle.\n\nREDSKINS 16, BUCCANEERS 3\n\nTAMPA, Fla. \u2014 Alex Smith threw for 178 yards and one touchdown, and Dustin Hopkins kicked three field goals for the Redskins (6-3), who forced four turnovers and rebounded from a lopsided loss to Atlanta despite playing with a makeshift offensive line because of mounting injuries.\n\nSmith, who was 19 of 27 with no interceptions, threw 6 yards to Josh Doctson for the game\u2019s only touchdown early in the fourth quarter. Hopkins kicked field goals of 43, 43 and 26 yards, the last set up by Greg Stroman\u2019s fourth-quarter interception and 24-yard return to the Bucs 14.\n\nRyan Fitzpatrick threw for 403 yards for Tampa Bay (3-6), but was intercepted twice and lost a fumble on a sack inside the Washington 10.\n\nThe Bucs, who\u2019ve lost three in a row and six of seven following a 2-0 start, failed to force a turnover on defense for the sixth straight game.\n\nThe Redskins were outgained 279 yards to 136 in the first two quarters, yet led 6-3 at halftime after getting two field goals from Hopkins.\n\nCOLTS 29, JAGUARS 26\n\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Andrew Luck threw three touchdown passes in the first half and the Colts\u2019 defense forced a late turnover. Indy (4-5) has won three straight.\n\nTight end Eric Ebron had a career-high three touchdowns, including one on a 2-yard run, all in the first half.\n\nBlake Bortles threw for 319 yards and two TDs, but the Jaguars (3-6) came up short when Kenny Moore III stripped the ball from Rashad Greene Sr. and Malik Hooker recovered for the Colts with 1:24 to go. Initially, Greene was ruled down by contact, but it was overturned on a replay review from the booth.\n\nJacksonville, last year\u2019s AFC runner-up, has lost five straight and six of seven since starting 2-0.\n\nLuck took full advantage of mismatches in the first half as the Jaguars struggled to cover Indy\u2019s tight ends.\n\nEbron, Jack Doyle and Mo Alie-Cox teamed up to catch eight passes for 133 yards and all three scores. Luck wound up 21 of 29 with 285 yards and one interception but avoided being sacked for the fourth consecutive game \u2014 the longest stretch of his pro career.\n\nBILLS 41, JETS 10\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 Matt Barkley stunningly sparked Buffalo\u2019s bumbling offense with two touchdown passes, including one to offensive tackle Dion Dawkins. LeSean McCoy broke out of a season-long slump with 113 yards rushing and a pair of TD runs.\n\nBarkley made his first start in nearly two years, and looked the best of any of the four quarterbacks the Bills (3-7) have trotted out this season. The 28-year-old journeyman was 15 of 25 for 232 yards while helping Buffalo snap a four-game losing streak as the Bills put up 451 yards of total offense.\n\nBarkley got the nod from coach Sean McDermott ahead of the ineffective Nathan Peterman despite having just two weeks of practice with the Bills since signing on Oct. 30. Rookie Josh Allen has missed four straight games with a sprained right elbow, and Derek Anderson is sidelined with a concussion. Barkley\u2019s last start came in the 2016 season finale for Chicago.\n\nMeanwhile, the hot seat under coach Todd Bowles has reached a boiling point as the Jets (3-7) got completely manhandled by a team that entered with a league-low 96 points and had two touchdowns in its previous four games.\n\nThe Jets have a bye-week break and the future of Bowles, in his fourth season, is in serious doubt.\n\nNew York started 39-year-old Josh McCown in place of injured rookie Sam Darnold, but he couldn\u2019t prevent the Jets from their fourth straight loss in front of a frustrated fan base that booed lustily throughout.\n\nMcCown was 17 of 34 for 135 yards with two interceptions.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Rick D'Elia/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nTwo former aides to the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) are publicly criticizing the Republican Party for seeking to cast doubt on the results of the Senate race in Arizona, where Democrat Kyrsten Sinema is narrowly edging out Republican Martha McSally.\n\nThe tweets by Mark Salter on Saturday and John Weaver on Sunday come amid ramped-up scrutiny of the race, in which Sinema leads by a little more than one percentage point.\n\nSeventy-five percent of Arizona\u2019s electorate votes by mail, meaning that counting ballots can typically take weeks as officials match voters\u2019 signatures on their ballots with those on their registration forms. Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan (R) explained the process in a statement Thursday and said that \u201ceverybody is working diligently to tabulate all of the election results in a manner that Arizonans can be proud of and, most importantly, trust the results.\u201d\n\nYet Republicans at the national level have struck a different note.

There have been fellow Arab dictators, such as Egypt\u2019s Abdel Fatah al-Sissi. There have been cynical opportunists, like Russia\u2019s Vladi\u00admir Putin.\n\nThen there\u2019s Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of a nation whose right to exist has yet to be recognized by Saudi Arabia. You wouldn\u2019t think Israel, in contrast to every Western democracy, would be explicitly endorsing a latter-day version of Saddam Hussein \u2014 a man so toxic that even K Street lobbyists are rejecting his money. And yet Netanyahu is emerging as Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s friend-in-need.\n\nFor a month after Khashoggi disappeared inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, the Israeli government was conspicuously silent. Then, a day or two after it was reported that Netanyahu had phoned the White House to lobby for Mohammed, he spoke up: While \u201cwhat happened in the Istanbul consulate was horrendous, and should be duly dealt with,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s very important for the stability of the world . . . that Saudi Arabia remain stable.\u201d\n\nIn case there is some doubt what it means to \u201cduly deal\u201d with the strangling and dismemberment of a journalist by a team of 15 thugs, Israel\u2019s ambassador in Washington, Ron Dermer, was more clear: It means, he said, that the United States should \u201cnot throw out the prince with the bathwater.\u201d\n\nWhy throw a lifeline to this killer? For Netanyahu, the Khashoggi crisis threatens to undo a carefully constructed regional strategy built around the 33-year-old Saudi crown prince \u2014 and President Trump. The idea is to forge a de facto alliance between Israel and the Middle East\u2019s new generation of Sunni dictators, united against Iran \u2014 and to enlist the United States to provide muscle. As a side benefit, Mohammed would support a Trump Middle East peace plan that, while yet to be unveiled, seems to amount to coercing Palestinians into accepting Israel\u2019s terms.\n\nUntil Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance, everything was going smoothly: Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal with Iran and restored economic sanctions; cut off U.S. aid to Palestinian refugees in Gaza while moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem; and resumed U.S. support for a Saudi bombing campaign against Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen that has killed tens of thousands of civilians. Netanyahu was meanwhile invited to visit Oman, a Saudi ally.\n\nNetanyahu also has made a show of identifying himself with Trump. He has been the Mike Pence of the Middle East; he even called out CNN for \u201cfake news.\u201d When Trump visited Tree of Life synagogue following the Pittsburgh massacre, against the wishes of local leaders, just one official was there to welcome him: Dermer. Naftali Bennett, a Netanyahu cabinet member who also flew in, spent the next few days vigorously defending Trump against charges that his support for white nationalism had encouraged U.S. anti-Semites. On the eve of the midterm elections, Bennett, who aspires to succeed Netanyahu, took to Twitter to heap still more praise on the president \u2014 in English \u2014 for \u201cMaking The Ayatollahs Scared Again.\u201d\n\nOf course, Israel has a long history of cultivating nasty dictators, as well as occupants of the Oval Office. Netanyahu\u2019s problem is that in betting so heavily on Mohammed and Trump, he took a large risk with two very unstable actors, each of whom has polarized their political systems. If Mohammed survives \u2014 something that for now seems more likely than not, given that the Trump administration remains committed to him \u2014 he will be weakened and wary. He won\u2019t be able to deliver the Palestinians for Trump\u2019s peace plan. There\u2019s a good chance Congress will cut off aid for bombing Yemen. Saudi Arabia\u2019s support for the anti-Iran coalition will amount to pumping oil.\n\nTrump, too, has been weakened by the Democrats\u2019 capture of the House of Representatives \u2014 and so has Netanyahu. What was once bipartisan U.S. support for Israel disappears when it comes to its current leader, who feuded with Barack Obama and all but campaigned for Mitt Romney in 2012. According to a Pew Research Center poll released this year, only 18 percent of Democrats had a favorable view of Netanyahu; twice as many regarded him unfavorably. That compared with 52 percent of Republicans who approved of the Israeli leader.\n\nWhile key Democratic leaders in the incoming House, including likely speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Eliot L. Engel (N.Y.), are staunchly pro-Israel, many of their new rank and file will not be. And a lot of Republicans as well as Democrats will be repelled by Netanyahu\u2019s appeals on Mohammed\u2019s behalf. Instead, the spectacle of an Israeli leader lobbying to excuse an Arab dictator for murder will only compound the damage he has done to his country\u2019s relationship with the United States.\n\nRead more from Jackson Diehl\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "In this Nov. 5, 2018, file photo, workers sort and pack strawberries at the Chambers Flat Strawberry Farm in Chambers Flat, Queensland, Australia.

Already, some pundits are warning that the new majority will \u201coverreach.\u201d But overreach is not the problem for a party that controls only one chamber of Congress.\n\nThe bigger threat is underachievement. Democrats will squander their victory \u2014 their largest gain in House seats since 1974 \u2014 if they fail to use their power to show what the alternative to Trumpism looks like.\n\nYes, many of their ideas will die in the Senate. But Republicans in that increasingly unrepresentative body should be made to pay a high price for thwarting progress. If the cost proves high enough, some good things might happen before 2020.\n\nThis is not about Democrats going \u201chard left,\u201d a phrase we\u2019ll hear a lot on Fox News. What unites the staunch progressives and their less overtly ideological brethren who won many of last week\u2019s contests is a desire to demonstrate that government, used intelligently, can make life better for the vast majority.\n\nFinding common ground across the center-left, one of the political imperatives of the new majority, does not mean least-common-denominator politics. It means agreeing on steps in the right direction: more people with health care, higher wages and family leave; more with an unimpeded right to vote; more feeling safer from violence; more with confidence that our system is not a cesspool.\n\nDemocrats are also being counseled against becoming the all-investigations-all-the-time party. But these admonitions assume that the party\u2019s leaders are, well, idiots. It won\u2019t be difficult to use the normal course of House business to hold hearings that expose both the policy failures of the Trump presidency and the corruption he has fostered. Committee chairmen should carefully time the inquiries so that scandals don\u2019t push each other aside and thereby fail to penetrate the public consciousness.\n\nThere should be a heavy emphasis on how Trump has betrayed his core promises \u2014 to stand up for forgotten Americans to whom he has delivered nothing but hateful demagoguery, most recently his evanescent interest in \u201ccaravans\u201d; and to drain a swamp he is in fact polluting even more.\n\nAll this would be easier if the rule of law did not face such a dire threat from Trump. His almost certainly illegal appointment of the swampy Matthew G. Whitaker as acting attorney general represents just such a peril. Given the Senate\u2019s sycophancy toward Trump, it falls to the House, the media and lower-court judges to protect us from autocracy. (We\u2019ll learn whether the Supreme Court can live up to its constitutional responsibilities.)\n\nIt is dangerously false to argue that Democrats must choose between legislating and holding Trump accountable. History gives them no choice but to do all they can to stop Trump from wrecking special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s inquiry, destroying evidence and politicizing law enforcement. If the president says the price of a decent infrastructure bill is Democratic acquiescence to law-breaking, let Trump pay the cost of breaking one of his signature pledges. It\u2019s in his interest to build those roads and bridges.\n\nRemembering what you campaigned on is always a good idea. Democrats have pledged quick action on protecting the insurance of Americans with preexisting health conditions and enacting a comprehensive democracy reform package with strong provisions on voting rights, campaign-finance reform, gerrymandering and ending the various forms of Trump-era corruption.\n\nThe next step would be expansions of health coverage through a public option or a Medicare buy-in consistent with the views of new members across the spectrum.\n\nAlso a priority: strong measures against gun violence. The mass killings continue unabated. Inaction would be immoral. It would also break the commitments so many of the newly elected made.\n\nFor the longer term, Democrats need to listen to former agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack and writers Alec MacGillis and Michael Tomasky on the imperative of forging a new agenda for rural, small-town and small-city America. Confining opportunity to the large metropolitan areas will deepen national divisions and, by the way, foster long-term Republican control of the Senate.\n\nOver the past century, Democrats held the House without controlling the Senate for only six years, between 1981 and 1987. The novelty of their situation underscores the need for both realism and vision. Combining them isn\u2019t easy. But it\u2019s their only path to seizing the opportunity they\u2019ve been granted.\n\nRead more from E.J.

Palestinian militants on Monday fired dozens of rockets and mortar shells into southern Israel, and the Israeli military responded by dispatching fighter jets to strike throughout the Gaza Strip. (Adel Hana/Associated Press)\n\nGAZA CITY, Gaza Strip \u2014 Palestinian militants bombarded Israel with dozens of rockets and mortar shells Monday, while Israeli warplanes struck targets throughout the Gaza Strip in what appeared to be the most intense exchange of fire since a 2014 war.\n\nPalestinian officials said at least three people, including two militants, were killed by Israeli fire and nine were wounded, and an Israeli airstrike destroyed the ruling Hamas group\u2019s TV station. In Israel, the national rescue service said at least 20 people were wounded, including a 19-year-old soldier and a 60-year-old woman who were in critical condition.\n\nThe fighting cast doubt over recent understandings brokered by Egypt and U.N. officials to reduce tensions. Just a day earlier, Israel\u2019s prime minister had defended those understandings, saying he was doing everything possible to avoid another war.\n\nThe United Nations said it was working with Egypt to broker a halt in the violence. \u201cRockets must STOP, restraint must be shown by all!\u201d the U.N. Mideast envoy\u2019s office tweeted.\n\nThe rocket fire was triggered by a botched Israeli military raid in Gaza on Sunday. Undercover troops, apparently on a reconnaissance mission, were discovered inside Gaza on Sunday, setting off a battle that left seven militants, including a Hamas commander, and an Israeli military officer dead.\n\nAround sundown on Monday, militants launched some 100 rockets in less than an hour, the most intense barrage since the 50-day war four years ago. The outgoing rockets, which continued into the evening, lit up the skies of Gaza and set off air raid sirens throughout southern Israel.\n\nThe military said warplanes, helicopters and tanks had struck over 70 militant targets, including military compounds, observation posts and weapons facilities. It also said it targeted a squad that was launching rockets.\n\nLt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said the army had sent additional infantry troops, rocket defense systems and intelligence units to the Gaza frontier.\n\n\u201cWe continue to strike and retaliate against the military targets belonging to terrorist organizations in Gaza, and as for our intentions we will enhance these efforts as needed,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nLate Monday, an airstrike destroyed the Gaza City headquarters of Hamas\u2019 Al Aqsa TV station. Israel had fired warning shots ahead of the airstrike, prompting the station to halt programming and replace it with a logo. Minutes later, the airstrike flattened the three-story building and the station went black.\n\nWorkers had evacuated the building after the warning shots, and there were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nHamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum condemned the bombing as \u201ca barbaric, brazen aggression.\u201d Ten minutes later, the station resumed broadcasts, airing prerecorded national songs.\n\nIsrael said the station \u201cbroadcasts violent propaganda\u201d and provides \u201coperational messaging\u201d to militants. A five-story office building that housed Hamas media offices and another building used by Hamas\u2019 internal security service were also destroyed. No casualties were reported.\n\nHamas and the smaller militant group Islamic Jihad said the rocket fire was revenge for Sunday night\u2019s Israeli incursion. Islamic Jihad spokesman Daoud Shehab said the groups wanted \u201cthe occupation and its supporters know that the lives of our sons come with a price.\u201d\n\nIn all, well over 300 rockets were fired into Israel by midnight, the army said. The Israeli military said it intercepted 70 rockets, and most of the others fell in open spaces. But rockets landed in the southern Israeli town of Sderot, setting off a large fire near a shopping center. Several homes were hit in southern towns, including one that was destroyed in Ashkelon. Around midnight, a rocket struck another building in Ashkelon, wounding at least 10 people, including one woman in critical condition, according to police and rescue workers.\n\nEarlier, a bus was struck by an anti-tank missile, critically wounding a 19-year-old soldier. The strike set the bus on fire, sending a large plume of black smoke over the area. Gaza militants released a video of what they said was the attack, showing a bus pulling up to an open area before going up in flames. The video, with ominous music playing, showed Israeli soldiers milling about the area.\n\nMichael Oren, an Israeli Cabinet minister, said Israel \u201cwill do whatever it takes\u201d to defend itself. \u201cWe expect the world to stand with us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe EU\u2019s ambassador to Israel, Emanuele Giaufret, called for a halt in \u201cindiscriminate\u201d rocket fire toward civilians. \u201cEveryone must step back from the brink,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier Monday, thousands of Palestinian mourners buried the seven militants killed in Sunday\u2019s incursion. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh led a funeral as masked gunmen in uniforms carried coffins and mourners chanted \u201crevenge.\u201d\n\nHamas set up checkpoints across Gaza in a show of force. It also restricted movement through crossings with Israel, preventing foreign journalists, local businessmen and some aid workers from leaving the territory.\n\nHamas also canceled a weekly beach protest in northwestern Gaza along the border with Israel. The organizers cited \u201cthe ongoing security situation.\u201d\n\nIsrael and Hamas have fought three wars since the Islamic militant group seized control of Gaza from the internationally-backed Palestinian Authority in 2007. In the most recent war, over 2,200 Palestinians were killed, more than half of them civilians, and tens of thousands were left homeless. Seventy-three people were killed on the Israeli side.\n\nIsrael and Egypt have maintained a blockade on Gaza since the Hamas takeover. The blockade has devastated Gaza\u2019s economy.\n\nFor over seven months, Hamas has been leading protests along the Israeli border aimed in large part at breaking the blockade. More than 170 Palestinians, most unarmed, have been killed by Israeli fire during the protests. Israel says it is defending its border against militant infiltration attempts.\n\nIn recent weeks, Egyptian and U.N. mediators had appeared to make progress in brokering informal understandings aimed at quieting the situation.\n\nLast week, Israel allowed Qatar to deliver $15 million to Gaza to allow cash-strapped Hamas to pay the salaries of thousands of government workers. At the same time, Hamas has lowered the intensity of the border protests in recent weeks.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a visit to Paris because of the flare-up and returned to Israel on Monday for consultations with top security officials.\n\nThe Hamas military wing said that in Sunday\u2019s incursion, Israeli undercover forces drove about 3 kilometers (2 miles) into southeastern Gaza and shot and killed a mid-level commander in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis. Hamas militants discovered the car and chased it, prompting Israeli airstrikes that killed several people, the group said.\n\nThe military provided few details about Sunday\u2019s raid. The Israeli military chief, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, said a \u201cspecial force\u201d carried out \u201ca very meaningful operation to Israel\u2019s security,\u201d without elaborating.\n\nIn a tweet after his arrival back home, Netanyahu praised the slain officer, whose identity was kept confidential for security reasons, and said \u201cour forces acted courageously.\u201d The officer\u2019s funeral was held Monday.\n\nOn Sunday, Netanyahu defended his decision to allow through the Qatari cash to Gaza as a way to avert an \u201cunnecessary war,\u201d maintain quiet for residents of southern Israel and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in the impoverished Gaza Strip.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Fares Akram reported in Gaza City and AP writer Josef Federman reported from Jerusalem.

He delivers speeches that contain insults and falsehoods. He announces policies on a whim, some constitutionally questionable.\n\nBut on a trip to Europe, the president hardly said a word \u2014 and he still managed to outrage at almost every turn.\n\nAside from a critical tweet aimed at French President Emmanuel Macron when Trump landed in Paris late Friday \u2014 one based on an inaccurate newspaper summary of an interview Macron gave suggesting that he had called the United States a threat \u2014 Trump didn\u2019t throw any sharp elbows at his peers here. It was still all about him.\n\nIn this case, it was because of the images.\n\nHe looked uncomfortable and listless in a bilateral meeting with Macron, whose sinewy energy stood in stark contrast to Trump\u2019s downbeat expression as the French leader patted him on the thigh.\n\nHe was a no-show at a scheduled tour of a military cemetery for Americans, while other world leaders publicly paid homage to those who died on the battlefield. Instead, the president holed up at the U.S. ambassador\u2019s residence, announcing later that he had spent a few hours making calls and attending meetings \u2014 but not offering to whom or about what.\n\nAnd Sunday, Trump arrived separately from the 60 other leaders at a World War I remembrance at the Arc de Triomphe. He had no speaking role, sitting stone-faced as Macron railed against the rise of nationalism \u2014 a rebuke of Trump\u2019s professed worldview.\n\nThe overall takeaway to many was a president turning away from the world, a man occupying the office of the leader of the free world who appeared withdrawn and unenthusiastic on the global stage.\n\n\u201cWatching the event from France I cannot recall a time when America seemed so isolated,\u201d David Axelrod, who was a senior political adviser to President Barack Obama, wrote on Twitter late Sunday. \u201cAmerica First feels like America Alone.\u201d\n\nOn previous foreign trips, Trump had made his presence felt, taking pains to push other leaders around. He shoved past the prime minister of Monte\u00adnegro to get to the front of a group of fellow leaders at a dedication ceremony of a new NATO headquarters in May 2017. He engaged in a macho 29-second handshake with Macron during a visit to Paris in July 2017 for a Bastille Day parade.\n\nHe abruptly revoked U.S. support for a milquetoast joint communique at the Group of Seven Summit in Quebec last spring, in a fit of pique over mild criticism from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whom Trump called \u201cmild and meek\u201d and \u201cvery dishonest & weak\u201d in a tweet. And he disparaged British Prime Minister Theresa May in an interview with a London newspaper that was published just as he arrived in the country to meet her in July.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump attends the American Commemoration Ceremony at the Suresnes American Cemetery in Paris on Nov. 11. (Marlene Awaad/Bloomberg News)\n\nIn Washington, before he left for Paris, Trump had been on a tear of executive actions after a midterm election in which Republicans lost control of the House. He ousted Jeff Sessions as attorney general and named a loyalist as his temporary replacement. He banned a CNN correspondent from the White House. And he signed a proclamation to deny asylum to Central American migrants, one that is likely to draw legal challenges.\n\nBut Trump displayed almost none of that kind of overt provocation here in Paris.\n\nAlthough national security adviser John Bolton had said Trump was likely to meet with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, it did not happen. They spoke, but only to begin setting up a formal meeting in two weeks at the Group of 20 Summit in Buenos Aires. Although Trump had made a big show of his summit in Helsinki in July \u2014 defying Washington\u2019s foreign policy elite who warned that he was rewarding Putin\u2019s bad behavior \u2014 it was Putin, not Trump, who revealed publicly that they had spoken in Paris.\n\nAnd according to Russia\u2019s authoritarian ruler, the reason he and Trump had not had a longer meeting here was out of respect for a request from their French hosts that they not do anything to overshadow the dignity of the remembrance ceremonies. In this telling, two leaders not known for respecting the global order were doing just that.\n\nLikewise, at a dinner for the world leaders Saturday at the presidential palace, the White House press pool was kept outside, not allowed in even for the standard \u201cpool spray\u201d in which they are permitted to enter for a quick photo op that often can lead to the kind of off-the-cuff remarks from Trump that set cable news chyrons ablaze and social media atwitter.\n\nTrump did make some news at the dinner \u2014 but not necessarily because he wanted to. It was the Turkish government that released a photo of Trump with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has said he has presented evidence that Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in Turkey as part of a Saudi government assassination plot.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders grudgingly confirmed to reporters the next day that the two leaders had been seated together and had spoken about the journalist\u2019s death.\n\nEven on Twitter, Trump was relatively mum on foreign affairs during the trip. He tweeted happy birthday wishes to the U.S. Marine Corps on Saturday and a Veterans Day greeting to the troops Sunday. He wrote several insensitive tweets about the forest fires in California, and he repeated a falsehood he has said before, implying that Democrats are trying to steal elections in Florida after the state began a recount in the gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races in which GOP candidates held narrow leads.\n\nBut Trump also wrote on Twitter that the World War I ceremony was \u201cBeautiful,\u201d and he thanked Macron. And in his 10-minute address at the Suresnes American Cemetery in Paris where more than 1,500 U.S. troops are buried, Trump stuck closely to his prepared remarks, which were respectful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful two days we spent in France,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is certainly the highlight.\u201d\n\nStill, the outrage was widespread and swift.\n\nReacting to a video clip from a Washington Post reporter showing world leaders striding together along the Champs-Elysees with Trump not participating, Michael V. Hayden, who served as director of the CIA and the National Security Agency under President George W. Bush, wrote on Twitter: \u201cWHAT!!! (Actually, what the **** ,but you know what I mean.\u201d\n\nDavid Rothkopf, a former editor of Foreign Policy magazine, mocked Trump: \u201cThe isolationism seems to be working. Have you ever seen an American president more isolated than Trump appears to be in Paris?\u201d\n\nIn Paris, the local newspapers were also highly critical. Le Journal\u2019s Sunday cover led with a close-up photo of Trump pointing a finger and the headline, \u201cWhy Trump threatens us.\u201d Le Parisien went with a photo of Trump and Macron facing off and the headline, \u201cMacron\u2019s other front.\u201d\n\nAnd Le Monde led its weekend edition with an even more ominous bulletin: \u201cThe Europe-United States divorce: Tensions in the Western family.\u201d It was accompanied by a photo of Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is covering her face with her hands.\n\nTrump was not making a sound, but his presence could still be heard loud and clear.", "Fresh off a resounding midterm elections victory, House Democrats on Sunday began detailing plans to wield their newfound oversight power in the next Congress, setting their sights on acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker while rebuffing calls from some liberals to pursue impeachment proceedings against President Trump.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), who is poised to take control of the House Judiciary Committee, said he will call Whitaker as a first witness to testify about his \u201cexpressed hostility\u201d to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s Russia investigation. Nadler said he is prepared to subpoena Whitaker if necessary.\n\nAnother incoming chairman, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) of the House Intelligence Committee, raised the possibility of investigating whether Trump used \u201cinstruments of state power\u201d in an effort to punish companies associated with news outlets that have reported critically on him, including CNN and The Washington Post.\n\nAnd Democrats on the House Oversight Committee plan to expand their efforts to investigate Trump\u2019s involvement in payments to women who alleged affairs with him before the 2016 election, a committee aide said Sunday night, potentially opening up the president\u2019s finances to further scrutiny.\n\nThe moves signal that House Democrats, while wary of the risks of alienating voters who backed the president, are fully embracing their midterm victory last week as a mandate to dig deep into the actions of the executive branch.\n\n\u201cThe key lesson that we\u2019ve learned from this last election is that the American people are sick and tired of the Trump administration, and they are looking for a Congress that is going to put a check on the executive branch,\u201d said Democratic strategist Zac Petkanas, a former senior aide to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign.\n\n\u201cSome talk about a backlash against the Democrats, but it was a backlash that brought them into power,\u201d he added. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t think they will easily be able to be seen as overreaching by the American people.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have a long list of legislative items on their agenda for the next Congress. They include long-sought legislation on gun control, as well as a potential overhaul of the federal Higher Education Act and a vote on protecting health coverage for people with preexisting conditions \u2014 an issue that many Democrats successfully wielded against their Republican opponents in last week\u2019s midterms.\n\nBut investigations are likely to capture the greatest attention on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nAt a news conference last Wednesday, Trump laid down a marker for congressional Democrats, warning them that any investigations into his administration would lead to a \u201cwarlike posture\u201d that would threaten the prospects of any bipartisan cooperation.\n\nDemocrats have previously said they plan to launch investigations into matters ranging from Trump\u2019s tax returns to his administration\u2019s policies on health care, education and immigration.\n\nOn Sunday, Schiff added a new possibility to the mix. The incoming House Intelligence Committee chairman pointed to Trump\u2019s effort to block AT&T from purchasing Time Warner, the parent company of CNN, and his desire to get the U.S. Post Office to increase shipping costs on Amazon.com as potential retaliation against two news outlets the president often complains treats him unfairly. Amazon founder and CEO Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Post.\n\n\u201cThe president is not only castigating the press, but might be secretly using instruments of state power to punish them. That\u2019s a great threat to press freedom,\u201d Schiff said in an interview with The Post. He first brought up the potential investigation during an interview with Axios.\n\nSuch a probe would not go through Schiff\u2019s committee, but probably the Oversight or Judiciary panels. Schiff said Democrats are convening when they return to Washington this week and he intends to raise it as a priority with his colleagues.\n\nIn an interview on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures,\u201d House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) dismissed Democratic plans to investigate the administration.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think the Democrats are going to be able to stop this agenda, because look at how much we have been able to grow,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI know what the Democrats want to do, just investigations and impeachment. But as I have said before, America\u2019s too great for a vision so small.\u201d\n\nRep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who is set to become chairman of the House Oversight Committee, sent a letter last month to the White House and the Trump Organization requesting documents related to the hush payments. The documents were not provided at the time, but \u201cthis should change now that we are in the majority,\u201d a Democratic committee aide said Sunday night. News of the panel\u2019s plans was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe pressure among the Democratic base to move against Trump remains strong: A Washington Post-Schar School poll released last week showed that among voters who supported Democratic House candidates in battleground districts, 64 percent believe Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against the president.\n\nBut party leaders have urged calm, emphasizing that before any serious talk of impeachment, a host of investigations \u2014 including Mueller\u2019s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign \u2014 must first be allowed to bear fruit. They also note that a vote to convict requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate, which will remain in Republican hands.\n\n\u201cWe are not doing any investigation for a political purpose, but to seek the truth,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that aired Sunday.\n\nPelosi, who is seeking to reclaim the speaker\u2019s gavel in the new Congress, described House Democrats as \u201cvery strategic\u201d and \u201cnot scattershot\u201d and said that her party will be pursuing \u201ca more open Congress with accountability to the public.\u201d Lawmakers will be \u201cseeking bipartisanship where we can find it\u201d and will \u201cstand our ground where we can\u2019t,\u201d she added.\n\nDemocrats appear to be focusing their energy on protecting Mueller\u2019s investigation, which some hope may eventually reveal enough about the president to help sway public opinion in their favor and give them enough fodder to launch proceedings against him.\n\nTrump has repeatedly sought to discredit the Mueller probe, denouncing it as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and arguing that it should have concluded long ago. His ouster of Jeff Sessions as attorney general last week and appointment of Whitaker over Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein to supervise the investigation triggered an outcry among Democrats and other critics, who viewed it as a first step toward the possible scuttling of the probe.\n\nThose fears were exacerbated in recent days amid revelations that Whitaker has been openly critical of the Mueller investigation, including in an appearance on CNN in which he floated the notion of a successor to Sessions who \u201cjust reduces [Mueller\u2019s] budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Republicans in Congress have refused to have any checks to perform our constitutional duty, being a check and balance on the president,\u201d Nadler said in an appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cWe will do that. And this is the first step in doing that. The president may think that he is above the law. He may think that he will not be held accountable, but he will be.\u201d\n\nNadler echoed other top Democrats who say they should hold their fire on the question of impeachment until they know what Mueller has uncovered. His test, he said, is whether there\u2019s enough evidence to convince even Trump supporters that such a step is necessary.\n\n\u201cIs the evidence so strong . . . [that] when all this is laid out publicly, a very large fraction of the people who voted for the president will grudgingly acknowledge to themselves and to others that you had no choice but to impeach the president?\u201d Nadler said.\n\nDemocrats in the Senate will also be pushing for legislation to prevent Whitaker from interfering with the Mueller investigation and will seek to attach it to a must-pass spending bill, Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Sunday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason we shouldn\u2019t add this and avoid a constitutional crisis,\u201d Schumer said on CNN. But he demurred when asked if Democrats would shut down the government over it, and said House Democrats should await the Mueller report before considering impeachment.\n\nTrump will probably nominate a permanent attorney general \u201cearly next year,\u201d one of his top congressional allies, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), said Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nThat means that the battle over Whitaker\u2019s role in the Mueller investigation could be largely finished by the time Democrats assume control of the House in January, said Orin Kerr, a law professor at the University of Southern California. The greatest tool at Democrats\u2019 disposal will then be their fact-finding ability, he said.\n\n\u201cThe key question is, what can we learn about what the executive branch has been doing?\u201d Kerr said. \u201cThat matters more than impeachment, given that we won\u2019t get removal from the Senate Republicans.\u201d\n\nStephen Spaulding, director of strategy at the nonprofit watchdog group Common Cause, said that there is a \u201creal pent-up need for oversight\u201d and that Democrats now have an obligation to do the work that outside organizations have largely been doing over the past two years through actions such as Freedom of Information Act requests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about following the evidence, asking tough questions,\u201d Spaulding said. \u201cIt truly is about accountability. We\u2019ve had two years with one party controlling both houses of Congress and, in some cases, actively undermining investigations. There\u2019s a backlog of answers; at the same time, there has to be a smart and strategic approach.\u201d", "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, second left, and his wife Sara, left, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Moroccan King Mohammed VI, right, and Crown Prince Moulay Hassan attend ceremonies at the Arc de Triomphe Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018 in Paris.

There\u2019s no Trent Williams for the time being. There\u2019s no Brandon Scherff or Shawn Lauvao for the rest of the year. When the offensive line is defined more by the players who aren\u2019t dressed than those who are, well, that\u2019s just a lousy place to start.\n\nAnd yet late Sunday afternoon, Jonathan Cooper looked over at Ty Nsekhe and Tony Bergstrom in the locker room, squirted some cologne in the air, stepped into it and said: \u201cThere it is. Very aromatic.\u201d\n\nIt smelled better than it looked Sunday, but who cares? Washington made it as fragrant as flowers. The Redskins beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 16-3, at Raymond James Stadium, and while you take some time to ponder how a team gained 501 yards of offense and scored only three points, as the Bucs did, consider also how a team that started three backups up front managed to win a game and climb to \u2014 woo, this is getting heady now \u2014 6-3 on the year.\n\n[Redskins earn an ugly win over Bucs, stay in first in NFC East]\n\nDon\u2019t go too far with that record, though. Forget what this means in the big picture for a moment and just give Washington credit for what\u2019s at the core of the NFL anyway: survival.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re winning ugly,\u201d Coach Jay Gruden said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s such a thing as winning ugly.\u201d\n\nThis is how they\u2019re going to have to do it, and if it\u2019s unsightly to watch, it can still bring smiles in the locker room and, presumably, to the fans. On Sunday, Nsekhe was the starting left tackle, replacing Williams, probably Washington\u2019s best offensive player, who sat out a second straight week with a thumb injury. Bergstrom was the starting right guard, replacing Scherff, who might trail only Williams in the pecking order but is done with a torn pectoral muscle.\n\nAnd the left guard in place of Lauvao \u2014 who (checks notes) tore an ACL \u2014 was Cooper. The journeyman spent the previous Sunday as not only not a member of Washington\u2019s team, but not a member of any team. Rather, he was driving to Charlotte after attending homecoming at the University of North Carolina, his alma mater. He planned to fly home to Arizona because he was still unemployed. Instead, he took a phone call, flew to Washington, worked out for team officials Monday, signed a contract Monday afternoon, spent the rest of the week in meetings \u2014 and started against Tampa Bay on Sunday.\n\n[Takeaways from the Redskins\u2019 win in Tampa]\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s balling out on Day One,\u201d Bergstrom said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018What was he doing on the couch?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThere is no couch for these guys, no comfort. Even if they\u2019re 6-3 for the first time in a decade \u2014 hello, Jim Zorn\u2019s first season! \u2014 there is fragility everywhere. The linemen could laugh and talk about their newly formed relationship Sunday because Washington\u2019s defense somehow came up with four turnovers and the Bucs gifted them a pair of missed field goals. That\u2019s six empty trips that could have easily yielded, say, 24 points, and if that happened, the tenor of this conversation is so much different.\n\nThere\u2019s an easy trap here: The Redskins won, so the line became cohesive quickly. There\u2019s some truth in that. But next week against Houston, it\u2019s possible that three sacks allowed and just 286 total yards \u2014 Washington\u2019s output against Tampa Bay \u2014 could be pointed to as the reason for a loss. The margin in the NFL is thin by design. The margin for Washington is thinner than a flamingo\u2019s leg.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll save the fantasy football for the guys who play that,\u201d Gruden said. \u201c . . . I told our team last night: \u2018[If] we win, 6-3 or \u00ad50-49, I don\u2019t care.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnd he shouldn\u2019t. He should praise the guys who performed the jobs that the team would prefer to be carried out by other people \u2014 and coach them to be better next week.\n\n[Josh Norman takes a shot at Redskins fans]\n\n\u201cThe big thing for offensive linemen is there aren\u2019t prima donnas,\u201d said Cooper, who five years ago was the seventh pick in the draft before he broke his leg in a preseason game, wiping out his rookie season and derailing his career. \u201cJust plug and play, honestly.\u201d\n\nThis is perilous, of course, because there\u2019s really no one left to plug. The coaches can mitigate the damage by manipulating the game plan, and Washington\u2019s offense isn\u2019t exactly designed to have quarterback Alex Smith stand in the pocket for six or seven seconds before heaving it downfield. But the players who are plugged in, they have to do it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s five of us out there,\u201d center Chase Roullier said. \u201cAnd a lot of what we do depends a lot on the timing of the guys around you.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t uncharted territory, if that helps at all. \u201cDeja vu,\u201d Bergstrom said. \u201cLast year, I was that guy coming in on the fly.\u201d Almost exactly a year ago, the Redskins played in Seattle with T.J. Clemmings at left tackle and Arie Kouandjio and Tyler Catalina as the guards \u2014 and won. Then they proceeded to lose four out of five.\n\nSo Sunday\u2019s result is Sunday\u2019s result. It makes for a hold on the NFC East lead. But it\u2019s a precursor to nothing. This Washington team has withstood just about all the injuries it can, because in addition to the linemen, wide receiver Paul Richardson Jr. is done for the year, and running back Chris Thompson and wide receiver Jamison Crowder haven\u2019t played in so long that it\u2019s easy to forget their impact when they do. (Psst, don\u2019t tell anyone, but tight end Jordan Reed hasn\u2019t missed a game. Cross your fingers and hold your breath.)\n\nWhat you\u2019re left with Sunday: satisfaction that a dizzying week concluded with a positive result. \u201cHectic,\u201d Cooper called it. \u201cDifficult,\u201d Roullier allowed.\n\nThey could be better going forward because each practice together is meaningful. They need to be better going forward. This is who the Redskins have. This is who the Redskins are. They won that way Sunday, so for another week, things smell just lovely.\n\nFor more by Barry Svrluga, visit washingtonpost.com/svrluga.", "Inside a half-filled Raymond James Stadium, with on-field temperatures climbing over 100 degrees, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers dominated the Washington Redskins.\n\nThey had 501 yards of offense.

The Redskins won again on a day in which they scored first, meaning they have gone nine games without the lead changing. The players seemed relieved to have won.\n\nThey also knew they had gotten by in a game in which they missed six Opening Day starters and had a makeshift offensive line that featured a left guard who had been out of the NFL until last Monday afternoon.\n\nBut there wasn\u2019t much to celebrate, either, and Coach Jay Gruden let a smirk slide across his face as he stood behind a postgame lectern.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say what actually happened in this game other than our guys played their tails off and figured out a way to get a win,\u201d he said.\n\nThe irony of Sunday is the 501 yards the Redskins allowed the Bucs is 10 more than they gave up to Atlanta last week. They lost that game, 38-14, because the Falcons were able not only to run up and down the field at will but also score touchdowns. Tampa Bay kept getting in its own way.\n\nThe 3-6 Buccaneers have been a mess this year \u2014 piling up loads of yards on offense but giving up almost as many on defense. Their coach, Dirk Koetter, took over the play-calling before Sunday\u2019s game for reasons he would not explain. And his offense thundered downfield for more than 50 yards on each of their first four drives, only to come away with just three points. A Josh Norman interception in the end zone ended one of them, a penalty for an illegal lateral forced a punt and a missed 30-yard field goal killed the third. They got a field goal on their fourth possession, not long before halftime, tying the game at 3, but those were all the points they would get.\n\n[Svrluga: Redskins\u2019 win over Bucs didn\u2019t look pretty, but it passes smell test]\n\nA 66-yard drive in the third quarter led to another missed field goal. Two fourth-quarter possessions of 56 and 73 yards ended on fumbles that were lost, including one on a giant punch-out by Washington outside linebacker Ryan Anderson that the Redskins recovered in the end zone for a touchback.\n\nBy then the Redskins had pulled together enough points, with two first-half field goals and a fourth-quarter touchdown and field goal, building what had become a commanding 16-3 lead. Tampa Bay kept moving the ball only to stumble at the end of drives, and by late in the fourth quarter, most of the 52,667 in the stands had long left.\n\nQuarterback Alex Smith had just 178 yards passing, the fourth game in five that he has thrown for fewer than 200. Running back Adrian Peterson had 68 yards, his lowest total in a victory this season. Maurice Harris, Jordan Reed and Josh Doctson combined for 13 catches, but none had more than 52 receiving yards. It was not an overwhelming effort against one of the league\u2019s worst passing defenses.\n\n[Game summary: Redskins 16, Buccaneers 3]\n\n\u201cThey were moving the ball, and our defense was getting stops and turnovers when we had to,\u201d Gruden said, seemingly acknowledging the fortune with which his team won. \u201cBut if that\u2019s what it takes to win a game, I really don\u2019t care. I\u2019ll save the fantasy football for the guys who play that. We just try to get a win and grind it out in any way we can.\u201d\n\nThat seems to be the formula Washington is using more and more this season. After the game, as they undressed in the locker room, linebacker Zach Brown asked fellow linebacker Mason Foster whether he had ever been 6-3 before. Foster didn\u2019t think he had. Not since high school. Brown thought the same.\n\n\u201c6-3 is a lot better than 5-4,\u201d Brown said.\n\nThe previous few days had been challenging for him and the other Redskins defensive players. Just the night before, Brown had angrily tweeted about criticism of him in the Atlanta loss. \u201cOwn coaches hating and blaming me,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOn Sunday, Brown laughed off the tweet, which had quickly been deleted. He didn\u2019t want to talk about it. In the hallway outside, Norman was criticizing the Redskins\u2019 home fans, saying that if it were up to him, the Redskins would play only road games. Nothing to them felt great about this win, other than the fact they had won.", "\n\nA neighborhood devastated by the Camp Fire in Paradise, Calif. As of Sunday, the death toll from the major fire was at 29, with many people still missing. (Mason Trinca/For The Washington Post)\n\nAs authorities on Sunday continued to search for bodies in the destroyed Northern California town of Paradise, fire weather returned to Southern California, with parched air pouring down from the mountains and generating flare-ups from the historic Woolsey Fire.\n\nDC-10 air tankers fought the wind gusts to drop bright-red flame retardant on rugged, unburned terrain as the fire invaded canyons where California meets the Pacific Ocean. At midday Sunday, the combined efforts of several thousand firefighters seemed to have the Woolsey Fire, now a protracted disaster, in check.\n\nBut the red-flag warnings \u2014 critical fire conditions \u2014 were forecast to last across the region until 5 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nFire chiefs had warned that the dreaded Santa Ana winds would be back around 10 a.m. Sunday, and they were right. The winds kicked up just as officials were holding a news conference warning that conditions remained dangerous. As they spoke, a massive plume of smoke rose in the southern sky from the direction of Malibu.\n\nThe Woolsey Fire had burned 83,000 acres by Sunday morning, with just 10 percent containment. The lull in the wind Saturday gave firefighters a chance to create firebreaks and drop massive amounts of fire retardant, but officials Sunday were anxious about a re-energized Woolsey Fire and the kind of weather that can create an entirely new, uncontrollable wildfire almost anywhere in tinder-dry California.\n\nIn Northern California, the Camp Fire, which wiped out Paradise, has been blamed for 29 deaths, with five more bodies discovered in homes Sunday and another in a vehicle. That death toll ties the Camp Fire with the deadliest in state history, the 1933 Griffith Park wildfire in Los Angeles. The Camp Fire burned nearly 7,000 buildings and is the most destructive individual fire in California history.\n\nSheriff\u2019s deputies and officials from the coroner\u2019s office have been examining charred homes that have been too hot for body-sniffing dogs. Butte County Sheriff Kory L. Honea said late Sunday that authorities were trying to account for 228 people reported missing by friends or family members. Honea said some may be in shelters. He urged citizens to tell authorities if and when they find a person who had been unaccounted for.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the victims died in their cars as they attempted to escape. Authorities have not released the names of victims, and Paradise, a city of 27,000 popular with retirees, is quarantined. The city is without power and has no operational businesses, and few residents have returned. Paradise has been essentially obliterated.\n\nHonea\u2019s office has ordered an additional DNA lab truck and received help from anthropologists at California State University at Chico for the time-consuming and daunting task of identifying victims.

Whitaker while rebuffing calls from some liberals to pursue impeachment proceedings against President Trump.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), who is poised to take control of the House Judiciary Committee, said he will call Whitaker as a first witness to testify about his \u201cexpressed hostility\u201d to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s Russia investigation. Nadler said he is prepared to subpoena Whitaker if necessary.\n\nAnother incoming chairman, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) of the House Intelligence Committee, raised the possibility of investigating whether Trump used \u201cinstruments of state power\u201d in an effort to punish companies associated with news outlets that have reported critically on him, including CNN and The Washington Post.\n\nAnd Democrats on the House Oversight Committee plan to expand their efforts to investigate Trump\u2019s involvement in payments to women who alleged affairs with him before the 2016 election, a committee aide said Sunday night, potentially opening up the president\u2019s finances to further scrutiny.\n\nThe moves signal that House Democrats, while wary of the risks of alienating voters who backed the president, are fully embracing their midterm victory last week as a mandate to dig deep into the actions of the executive branch.\n\n\u201cThe key lesson that we\u2019ve learned from this last election is that the American people are sick and tired of the Trump administration, and they are looking for a Congress that is going to put a check on the executive branch,\u201d said Democratic strategist Zac Petkanas, a former senior aide to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign.\n\n\u201cSome talk about a backlash against the Democrats, but it was a backlash that brought them into power,\u201d he added. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t think they will easily be able to be seen as overreaching by the American people.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have a long list of legislative items on their agenda for the next Congress. They include long-sought legislation on gun control, as well as a potential overhaul of the federal Higher Education Act and a vote on protecting health coverage for people with preexisting conditions \u2014 an issue that many Democrats successfully wielded against their Republican opponents in last week\u2019s midterms.\n\nBut investigations are likely to capture the greatest attention on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nAt a news conference last Wednesday, Trump laid down a marker for congressional Democrats, warning them that any investigations into his administration would lead to a \u201cwarlike posture\u201d that would threaten the prospects of any bipartisan cooperation.\n\nDemocrats have previously said they plan to launch investigations into matters ranging from Trump\u2019s tax returns to his administration\u2019s policies on health care, education and immigration.\n\nOn Sunday, Schiff added a new possibility to the mix. The incoming House Intelligence Committee chairman pointed to Trump\u2019s effort to block AT&T from purchasing Time Warner, the parent company of CNN, and his desire to get the U.S. Post Office to increase shipping costs on Amazon.com as potential retaliation against two news outlets the president often complains treats him unfairly. Amazon founder and CEO Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Post.\n\n\u201cThe president is not only castigating the press, but might be secretly using instruments of state power to punish them. That\u2019s a great threat to press freedom,\u201d Schiff said in an interview with The Post. He first brought up the potential investigation during an interview with Axios.\n\nSuch a probe would not go through Schiff\u2019s committee, but probably the Oversight or Judiciary panels. Schiff said Democrats are convening when they return to Washington this week and he intends to raise it as a priority with his colleagues.\n\nIn an interview on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures,\u201d House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) dismissed Democratic plans to investigate the administration.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think the Democrats are going to be able to stop this agenda, because look at how much we have been able to grow,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI know what the Democrats want to do, just investigations and impeachment. But as I have said before, America\u2019s too great for a vision so small.\u201d\n\nRep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who is set to become chairman of the House Oversight Committee, sent a letter last month to the White House and the Trump Organization requesting documents related to the hush payments. The documents were not provided at the time, but \u201cthis should change now that we are in the majority,\u201d a Democratic committee aide said Sunday night. News of the panel\u2019s plans was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe pressure among the Democratic base to move against Trump remains strong: A Washington Post-Schar School poll released last week showed that among voters who supported Democratic House candidates in battleground districts, 64 percent believe Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against the president.\n\nBut party leaders have urged calm, emphasizing that before any serious talk of impeachment, a host of investigations \u2014 including Mueller\u2019s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign \u2014 must first be allowed to bear fruit. They also note that a vote to convict requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate, which will remain in Republican hands.\n\n\u201cWe are not doing any investigation for a political purpose, but to seek the truth,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that aired Sunday.\n\nPelosi, who is seeking to reclaim the speaker\u2019s gavel in the new Congress, described House Democrats as \u201cvery strategic\u201d and \u201cnot scattershot\u201d and said that her party will be pursuing \u201ca more open Congress with accountability to the public.\u201d Lawmakers will be \u201cseeking bipartisanship where we can find it\u201d and will \u201cstand our ground where we can\u2019t,\u201d she added.\n\nDemocrats appear to be focusing their energy on protecting Mueller\u2019s investigation, which some hope may eventually reveal enough about the president to help sway public opinion in their favor and give them enough fodder to launch proceedings against him.\n\nTrump has repeatedly sought to discredit the Mueller probe, denouncing it as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and arguing that it should have concluded long ago. His ouster of Jeff Sessions as attorney general last week and appointment of Whitaker over Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein to supervise the investigation triggered an outcry among Democrats and other critics, who viewed it as a first step toward the possible scuttling of the probe.\n\nThose fears were exacerbated in recent days amid revelations that Whitaker has been openly critical of the Mueller investigation, including in an appearance on CNN in which he floated the notion of a successor to Sessions who \u201cjust reduces [Mueller\u2019s] budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Republicans in Congress have refused to have any checks to perform our constitutional duty, being a check and balance on the president,\u201d Nadler said in an appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cWe will do that. And this is the first step in doing that. The president may think that he is above the law. He may think that he will not be held accountable, but he will be.\u201d\n\nNadler echoed other top Democrats who say they should hold their fire on the question of impeachment until they know what Mueller has uncovered. His test, he said, is whether there\u2019s enough evidence to convince even Trump supporters that such a step is necessary.\n\n\u201cIs the evidence so strong . . . [that] when all this is laid out publicly, a very large fraction of the people who voted for the president will grudgingly acknowledge to themselves and to others that you had no choice but to impeach the president?\u201d Nadler said.\n\nDemocrats in the Senate will also be pushing for legislation to prevent Whitaker from interfering with the Mueller investigation and will seek to attach it to a must-pass spending bill, Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Sunday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason we shouldn\u2019t add this and avoid a constitutional crisis,\u201d Schumer said on CNN. But he demurred when asked if Democrats would shut down the government over it, and said House Democrats should await the Mueller report before considering impeachment.\n\nTrump will probably nominate a permanent attorney general \u201cearly next year,\u201d one of his top congressional allies, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), said Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nThat means that the battle over Whitaker\u2019s role in the Mueller investigation could be largely finished by the time Democrats assume control of the House in January, said Orin Kerr, a law professor at the University of Southern California. The greatest tool at Democrats\u2019 disposal will then be their fact-finding ability, he said.\n\n\u201cThe key question is, what can we learn about what the executive branch has been doing?\u201d Kerr said. \u201cThat matters more than impeachment, given that we won\u2019t get removal from the Senate Republicans.\u201d\n\nStephen Spaulding, director of strategy at the nonprofit watchdog group Common Cause, said that there is a \u201creal pent-up need for oversight\u201d and that Democrats now have an obligation to do the work that outside organizations have largely been doing over the past two years through actions such as Freedom of Information Act requests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about following the evidence, asking tough questions,\u201d Spaulding said. \u201cIt truly is about accountability. We\u2019ve had two years with one party controlling both houses of Congress and, in some cases, actively undermining investigations. There\u2019s a backlog of answers; at the same time, there has to be a smart and strategic approach.\u201d", "MEXICO CITY \u2014 Thousands of people marched in Mexico City on Sunday to protest President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s plans to cancel a new $13 billion airport for the capital.\n\nMarchers dismissed the referendum that led to the cancellation as unconstitutional and compared Lopez Obrador to Venezuela\u2019s socialist president, Nicolas Maduro.\n\nLast month, 70 percent of participants voted against continuing the project, which Lopez Obrador has criticized as too costly.

And they have accompanied their indignant messages with photographs of feet sliding on red-splattered floors, of swabs and scrubs drenched in blood, and occasionally of unidentifiable and misshapen torsos heaped on gurneys.\n\nThey write of delivering a shattered baby that saved its mother\u2019s life by stopping a bullet, and of hiding blood and brain matter from parents. They show how the stunned public responses to the Oct. 27 carnage in a Pittsburgh synagogue and then the Nov. 7 shooting in a Thousand Oaks, Calif., country music bar fail to reflect the everyday routine of trying to resuscitate victims in emergency rooms in Baltimore and beyond.\n\n\u201cBeing silenced is not acceptable,\u201d Sakran said in an interview, describing how he still keeps the bullet fragment that nearly killed him on his dresser.\n\nThe NRA did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nKathleen Bell, a physiatrist at the University of Texas who specializes in patient rehabilitation, said she was working on patient charts in her office overlooking the trauma center\u2019s heliport when she learned about the NRA tweet. She posted on behalf of patients who, she explained, face ongoing indignities and pain long after any public outrage has passed.\n\n\u201cLet me mention lifetimes in wheelchairs with SCI [spinal cord injury],\u201d Bell wrote, \u201cuseless arms from brachial plexus destruction, colostomies from belly destruction and years of dependence with TBI [traumatic brain injury].\u201d\n\nThe NRA tweet was spurred by a position paper from the American College of Physicians posted on Oct. 30 by the Annals of Internal Medicine and titled \u201cReducing Firearm Injuries and Deaths in the United States.\u201d The ACP recommended \u201ca public health approach to firearms-related violence and the prevention of firearm injuries and deaths,\u201d saying the medical profession has a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d to speak out on the prevention of such injuries and supporting \u201cappropriate regulation of the purchase of legal firearms,\u201d among other measures.\n\n\u201cThe College acknowledges that any such regulations must be consistent with the Supreme Court ruling establishing that individual ownership of firearms is a constitutional right under the Second Amendment of the Bill of Rights,\u201d the paper said.\n\nThe NRA lashed out, first with a Nov. 2 editorial saying that the ACP paper \u201creflects every anti-gunner\u2019s public policy wish list, save for the outsized role given to doctors,\u201d and accusing the group of being \u201conly interested in pseudo\u00adscience \u2018evidence\u2019 that supports their preferred anti-gun policies.\u201d\n\nThen on Nov. 7, just hours before 28-year-old former Marine Ian David Long launched his attack at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, the NRA put out its provocative tweet.\n\n\u201cSomeone should tell self-\n\nimportant anti-gun doctors to stay in their lane. Half of the articles in Annals of Internal Medicine are pushing for gun control. Most upsetting, however, the medical community seems to have consulted NO ONE but themselves.\u201d\n\nNot only did individual doctors respond in gruesome fury, but the Annals of Internal Medicine told the NRA to stay \u201cout of the exam room\u201d and invited doctors to sign onto a commitment to speak to patients about firearm ownership and safety whenever they see risk factors. \u201cEvidence shows that your counsel could save a life,\u201d the publication tweeted.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also published new data revealing that the death toll from gun violence has begun increasing in recent years after a brief lull.\n\nStill, many doctors are keen to point out that they are not anti-gun. Or even anti-NRA.\n\n\u201cDoctors are not at war with the NRA,\u201d said Heather Sher, a radiologist who has worked in Level 1 trauma centers for almost 17 years and has cared for patients with gunshot wounds from two separate mass shootings. Sher gained prominence after the Parkland, Fla., school shooting when she published an article in the Atlantic about the damage caused by high-velocity bullets from a semiautomatic rifle, which was unlike any handgun injury she had seen.\n\n\u201cIt is not an \u2018us versus them,\u2019 issue,\u201d Sher wrote in an email. \u201cWhat we are truly asking for is a coming together of both sides to find a solution to this national health problem.\u201d\n\nStill, some doctors who were familiar with the world of guns couldn\u2019t quell their dismay.

Neither candidate was able to win more than 50 percent of the vote in the Nov. 6 special election.\n\nEspy and Hyde-Smith had the top two vote tallies, each receiving about 41 percent. If Espy were to win, he would be become the first black senator to represent the state since the Reconstruction era. Espy served three terms in the House of Representatives, from 1987 to 1993.\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Espy called Hyde-Smith\u2019s comments \u201creprehensible.\u201d He added, \u201cThey have no place in our political discourse, in Mississippi, or our country. We need leaders, not dividers, and her words show that she lacks the understanding and judgment to represent the people of our state.\u201d\n\nMany critics of Hyde-Smith\u2019s comment noted the history of racism and hangings in the state.

(Saul Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nThe first-ever recount in three statewide races in Florida kicked off in earnest Sunday on a contentious note, with Republican Gov. Rick Scott sharpening his attacks on his opponent in the razor-tight U.S. Senate race and filing a new round of lawsuits against Democratic election officials.\n\nHours after Scott took to national television to accuse Sen. Bill Nelson (D) of trying to \u201ccommit fraud to try to win this election,\u201d his campaign said it had filed lawsuits against Brenda Snipes and Susan Bucher, the election supervisors in Broward and Palm Beach counties, two Democratic strongholds. Democrats called it desperation by a candidate sitting on a precarious vote lead.\n\nScott made his comments in an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that came after his lead shrank to fewer than 13,000 votes in a race with national stakes. State officials said they have no evidence of criminal conduct in the still-unresolved Senate election.\n\nPressed on his fraud claim, Scott referred to a lawsuit Nelson has filed to reexamine ballots with signature issues. He also mentioned an incident, being reported by conservative media, in which a lawyer claiming to represent Nelson objected in a public hearing to tossing out a provisional ballot from a noncitizen.\n\nNelson\u2019s lead recount attorney, Marc Elias, said in a statement that the lawyer at a meeting of election officials in Palm Beach County was \u201cnot someone we had authorized to make such an objection. Non-citizens cannot vote in U.S. elections.\u201d\n\nElection administrators are racing against the clock to \u00admachine-recount ballots ahead of a Thursday deadline to present their findings, with many of the state\u2019s 67 counties beginning the task on Sunday. A more logistically complicated hand recount could follow. The contest will determine the size of the GOP\u2019s Senate majority and settle an expensive fight in the nation\u2019s largest swing state.\n\nThat race, as well as the closely watched gubernatorial contest between former congressman Ron DeSantis (R) and Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum (D), have attracted national attention, pitting candidates with sharply contrasting messages and embodying broader disputes between the two major parties during the Trump presidency.\n\nThe governor\u2019s comments came a day after Secretary of State Ken Detzner, a Scott appointee, formally ordered recounts in the races for Senate, governor and agriculture commissioner.\n\nIn the Senate contest, Scott\u2019s lead over Nelson has narrowed to 12,562 votes out of more than 8 million ballots cast, or a margin of 0.15 percent, according to an unofficial tally Saturday from the state. State law mandates a machine recount if the margin is half a percentage point or smaller.\n\nThe governor\u2019s race also has tightened, with DeSantis, a staunch ally of President Trump, ahead of Gillum by 0.41 percent. If it holds, the margin would fall short of the 0.25 percent threshold for a more involved manual recount.\n\nIf the margin in the Senate race holds, however, it would be slim enough to trigger a hand recount. In that scenario, officials would have three days to personally inspect ballots with overvotes or undervotes \u2014 ballots on which the voter selected no candidate or more than one candidate in the race \u2014 provided there are enough to change the outcome. That could spark disputes over whether the voter intended to mark it that way or not.\n\nThe election results are slated to be certified on Nov. 20. Newly elected senators are expected to report to Washington this week for orientation. Scott said he has not decided his schedule yet. The Senate will swear in new members in early 2019.\n\nThere remains plenty of uncertainty about the path forward. Delays and new legal disputes that could slow the pace of the proceedings are possible.\n\nA lawsuit filed by Nelson seeking another look at absentee and provisional ballots with signatures that don\u2019t match voter registration records will be heard by a federal judge this week and could have a major impact on the election\u2019s outcome.\n\nThe machine recount itself will be time-consuming. In Broward County, it could take more than 30 hours just to sort through the pages with races that need to be recounted, according to election operations coordinator Fred Bellis.\n\nGOP criticism of vote counting has centered on Broward and another Democratic-leaning county in South Florida \u2014 Palm Beach, where Republicans cited the incident over the ballot involving a noncitizen. The Republicans have upbraided officials there for tallying ballots slowly and not providing enough transparency about their process.\n\nIn its new lawsuits against Snipes and Bucher, Scott\u2019s campaign seeks to have authorities \u201cimpound and secure all voting machines, tallying devices, and ballots when not in use until such time as any recounts, election contests, or litigation related to the 2018 general election for the office of United States Senator are complete.\u201d\n\nThe Scott campaign filed another lawsuit asking that ballots counted in Broward County after a noon Saturday deadline to submit results not be included in the county\u2019s official returns.\n\nIn an interview, Snipes denied that she missed the noon deadline. \u201cThere\u2019s no rampant fraud here,\u201d she said. Amid some Republican complaints about a recount delay, Snipes vowed, \u201cWe\u2019ll make the deadlines if we have to work 24 hours a day.\u201d\n\nNelson said Scott was operating from a position of desperation.\n\n\u201cIf Rick Scott wanted to make sure every legal ballot is counted, he would not be suing to try and stop voters from having their legal ballot counted as intended,\u201d the senator said in a statement. \u201cHe\u2019s doing this for the same reason he\u2019s been making false and panicked claims about voter fraud \u2014 he\u2019s worried that when all the votes are counted he\u2019ll lose this election.\n\nBroward and Palm Beach counties have come under legal pressure and scrutiny. Last week, judges ordered officials in Palm Beach County to open their canvass to public inspection and Broward officials to release documents the governor had demanded.\n\nSnipes has been the subject of controversies and criticism in the past. In 2016, she was accused of destroying physical ballots while saving digital copies during a lawsuit, a violation of a federal statute.\n\nBut Florida\u2019s Department of State said last week that it had seen \u201cno evidence of criminal activity at this time\u201d in Broward County. A spokeswoman for the department, Sarah Revell, said Sunday that statement was still accurate.\n\nLast week, Scott called for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate the voting in South Florida. The agency has not embarked on a probe, because the Department of State has not presented any allegations of fraud, a spokesman for the Department of Law Enforcement, Jeremy Burns, said Sunday, repeating what he had previously said.\n\nState Attorney General Pam Bondi, a Republican, sent a letter Sunday to FDLE Commissioner Richard Swearingen saying that she was \u201ctroubled\u201d that he was not pursuing probes into irregularities, adding, \u201cYour duty to investigate this matter is clear.\u201d She also wrote Detzner to remind him to report signs of criminal activity. Representatives for Swearingen and Detzner did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\n\nGillum said he has a team of hundreds of volunteers and lawyers fanning out to ensure the recount process is, in his estimation, fair and accurate. He hosted a \u201ccount every vote\u201d event at a church in Broward County on Sunday afternoon.\n\nScott\u2019s campaign said this weekend that it has enlisted 7,500 volunteer recount representatives to monitor the process. Scott also has encouraged sheriffs to watch for any violations.\n\nReinhard reported from Lauderhill, Fla., and Sonmez from Washington.

(Joe Cavaretta /South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP)\n\nThe president warns that Democrats are \u201ctrying to STEAL two big elections in Florida.\u201d The National Republican Senatorial Committee accuses an Arizona elections official of \u201cdestroying evidence to cook the books.\u201d Newt Gingrich worries that the \u201cvery fabric of our country\u201d is being torn apart.\n\nAnother way of putting this is that it may take a few weeks until we know who won the last uncalled races of 2018. As in 2000 (Florida) and 2008 (Minnesota), Republicans are raising the specter of a \u201cstolen\u201d election to raise questions about late-counted ballots and possible recounts. (Those questions have been frivolous so far.)\n\nThe more relevant history here might be 2008's. Florida Democrats have retained Marc Elias, the attorney who helped get Al Franken through Minnesota's long recount process, to help Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.). Ron Klain, the general counsel of Al Gore's 2000 recount committee, said in an email that Democrats were \"doing a good job of keeping it on track\" and ignoring the \"fraud\" claims.\n\n\u201cNelson\u2019s big advantage that Gore didn\u2019t have is the lack of a ticking clock,\" said Klain. \u201cBecause the Electoral College loomed, the GOP in 2000 invested heavily in a strategy of delay and letting the clock run out. That strategy isn\u2019t available to them now, so they are trying a long ball strategy of just trying to de-legitimize the whole thing. The Dems are doing their business in a lawful and orderly way and not getting derailed.\u201d\n\nIn three closely watched statewide races, there are questions about who actually won, and they won't be answered for days or weeks, after a lot of time counting ballots and a little more time in court. Keep an eye on races in Florida for governor and agriculture commissioner, too, and in Arizona for secretary of state, races that seemed over on election night; Democrat Andrew Gillum has taken back his concession in the first race, Democrat Nikki Fried now leads in the second, and the third has closed to a difference of fewer than 3,000 votes. All numbers are as of writing.\n\nFlorida Senate. The closest Senate race in the country ended with Gov. Rick Scott (R) up by 12,562 votes out of more than 8 million cast. The big question for Democrats is the fate of 24,992 ballots in Broward County that recorded a vote for governor but not for Senate. If they were pure under-votes, and the placement of the Senate (and House) race at the bottom left of the ballot led to 24,992 voters just not noticing the Senate race, then Nelson obviously can't add any more votes. If the ballot design simply led to machine errors, Nelson's legal team believes he could close to within a few thousand votes, based on his 2-1 victory so far in the county.\n\nHow else could the lead change? There are at least 20,000 overseas ballots coming back to the state, mostly from members of the military. Overall, more of those ballots were sent to Democrats than to Republicans; history, though, suggests that they might end up skewing toward Scott. The X factor is the Nelson campaign's lawsuit against the state's \u201csignature match\u201d requirement, a relatively new voting reform that has faced trouble in court before, as it may lead to legitimate votes being thrown out.\n\nArizona Senate. Unlike in Florida, Republicans here have vehemently denied that anything's amiss with their slow, slow vote count; this is a state where more than half of voters now cast early ballots, and those counts take a while. Right now, with around 260,000 ballots left to tabulate, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D) leads by 29,832 votes. Rep. Martha McSally (R) would need to take 56 percent of the remaining ballot pile to come out ahead.\n\nMcSally's campaign is arguing that \u201cthe largest remaining category of votes to be counted strongly favor Martha,\u201d but independent analysts are increasingly expecting a Sinema win for two reasons. One: While McSally's camp says Republican voters likely turned in ballots late, Sinema was cutting the state's traditional GOP advantage by Election Day \u2014 a trend seen in the other close races, like secretary of state and superintendent of public instruction. Two: Sinema ran up the score in metro Phoenix and Pima County (Tucson), which could overwhelm whatever breaks for McSally.\n\nGeorgia Governor. Democrats here are playing not for a win, but for a vote count that would push Republican Brian Kemp's total below 50 percent. Abrams's campaign estimates that a gain of 25,632 votes would do that; Kemp, who has resigned as secretary of state, has said there are only around 25,000 outstanding ballots to count. If that's true, even winning 100 percent of what's left would not save Abrams, which is why her campaign, backed by the Democratic National Committee, is raising legal questions to qualify more provisional ballots.\n\nWhat's left uncalled for the House\n\nCalifornia 10. Democrat Josh Harder currently leads Rep. Jeff Denham (R) by 3,307 votes, and Republicans have a sinking feeling about what comes next. Harder has a clear advantage in Stanislaus County, which comprises most of the district and has 80,360 ballots left to count. In the June \u201cjungle\u201d primary, Harder's total kept increasing as the late ballots were counted.\n\nCalifornia 39. Every vote count since Election Day has tightened this race; by Saturday night, Republican Young Kim led Democrat Gil Cisneros by 2,762 votes out of more than 163,000 counted. The path for Cisneros: limit his losses in the part of the district that covers Orange and San Bernardino counties and keep building a lead in the part that covers Los Angeles County. There are tens of thousands of votes from each portion still to count; Orange County will have an update Monday, while the other two counties will update Tuesday. In the past, it's taken two more weeks to finish this count.\n\nCalifornia 45. Yet again, late-counted ballots have favored the Democrat; here, Katie Porter has cut into Republican Rep. Mimi Walters's Election Day lead by two-thirds and ended Saturday down by 2,020 votes. There are as many as 50,000 votes left to count, and if Porter wins just 53 percent of that batch, she pulls ahead. Control of the House is already determined, but there are plenty of bragging rights here. If Democrats moved ahead, it would be with an acolyte of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and it would break the losing streak that groups like the Progressive Change Campaign Committee had Tuesday. Wins in the 39th and 45th would wipe out Republicans in Orange County.\n\nGeorgia 07. An election night reporting error briefly led some analysts to project Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux as the winner here; now, with the errors corrected, she's behind Rep. Rob Woodall (R) by 901 votes. The Democrat is expected to wait until the provisional ballot count to finish (there are several thousand, which she'd need to win by a 2-1 margin), then request a recount.\n\nMaine 02. Rep. Bruce Poliquin (R) led the final initial count here by 1,910 votes and declared a sort of victory over Democrat Jared Golden. Only sort of; 23,433 voters cast ballots for one of two left-leaning independent candidates, and for the first time, the election operated on a \u201cranked choice\u201d system, allowing voters to rank the candidates. This coming week, the state will add up voters' second preferences, then third preferences, until either Poliquin or Golden cracks 50 percent. Golden is expected to win when votes are reallocated.\n\nNew Jersey 03. Democrat Andy Kim declared victory here after absentee ballots were counted and found him leading Rep. Tom MacArthur (R) by 3,424 votes. MacArthur hasn't conceded; there are 6,400-odd outstanding provisional ballots, and if he won them strongly \u2014 if he won roughly 54 percent of them \u2014 he could pull back ahead. Democrats simply don't think it'll happen, because 4,000 of those ballots are from Burlington County, where Kim won easily.\n\nNew York 22. Democrat Anthony Brindisi is slightly ahead, by 1,293 votes, in New York's closest outstanding race. To pull this out, Rep. Claudia Tenney (R) needs to win 54 percent of the 14,000-odd absentee ballots still uncounted. The state should have them counted this week.\n\nNew York 27. Rep. Chris Collins (R) has already declared victory here, but his margin of 2,910 votes is smaller than the pile of 13,000 absentee ballots that will be counted next week. Democrat Nate McMurray would need to win around 62 percent of those ballots \u2014 slightly less if some voters alienated from Collins by his insider-trading indictment voted for a Reform Party candidate, who did better than expected.\n\nTexas 23. First, the Associated Press called the race for Rep. Will Hurd (R). Then a counting error briefly put Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones in the lead. The call was retracted and the error fixed. Now Hurd is urging Ortiz Jones to concede; he's up by 1,080 votes, and failing a calculation error, she can't catch up. The AP won't weigh in again unless a recount becomes impossible for Ortiz Jones.\n\nUtah 04. Democrat Ben McAdams leads this race by 4,906 votes, but that's tightened since election night; Rep. Mia Love (R) is winning Utah County by a 3-1 margin. There may be 151,000 votes left to count, and the count won't pick up until Tuesday; Love would only need to win around 52 percent of what's left to flip the race. Speaking of bragging rights: Love was mocked by President Trump at his post-election news conference, as a candidate who gave the president \u201cno love\u201d and thereby lost her seat.\n\nWHAT I'M WATCHING\n\nProtesters outside the Broward County Supervisor of Elections office on Sunday. (Joe Skipper/Getty Images)\n\nThe great \u201celection fraud\u201d debate. There is no outcome \u2014 none \u2014 that will send voters into 2019 without millions of them asking whether the 2018 election was fair. The tone was set this week, as Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) accused \u201cunethical liberals\u201d and \u201cDemocrat DC lawyers\u201d of \u201cvoter fraud\u201d in Democratic counties, and as Georgia Democrats decried the lack of voting machines in heavily black precincts around Atlanta.\n\nThere were documented voting problems in Georgia, including tens of thousands of voters struck from the rolls and several precincts where a lack of voting machines created lines of three hours or more. But Scott hasn't provided evidence of fraud or officially ordered an investigation of Broward County. Notably, Scott's been bypassing local media to speak to Fox News, which has not challenged his claims on the air.\n\nAlso notably, NRSC Chairman Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) declined to defend everything Scott, and even the NRSC itself, has alleged about Florida and Arizona, telling NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d today that \u201cthere's a lot of releases that are going to go out that I don't see.\u201d When pressed, he compared the questions about voter integrity to the questions raised by Democrats after the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cIt's not the first time someone's been accused of cooking the books or rigging the election,\u201d Gardner said. \"That's what the last two years have been about.\"\n\nThat comment might have revealed more than Gardner meant it to. Democrats' questions about the 2016 election have led to investigations and reforms, not to the voting system, but to the pipeline of digital advertising that foreign agencies used to spread misinformation. It led, a bit less directly, to Facebook publishing information about ad buys, ending the ability of campaigns to buy \u201cdark posts\u201d that were targeted to some voters and invisible to rival campaigns.\n\nBoth parties are going to come out of Tuesday raising questions about who really won a number of elections, and here's what might come under the microscope.\n\nLocal election management. The through line in GOP complaints about Arizona and Florida is that Democratic counties, where elections are overseen by local supervisors, are risking the integrity of the entire election by failing to meet local standards. A lot of these charges will crumble under scrutiny, but in both states, Republicans are likely to control every branch of government in January; the question is whether Republicans would increase the state's power to run these elections, including hiring and firing supervisors.\n\nSignature match laws. The ACLU has now waged two lawsuits against states that toss absentee ballots if the signatures on them do not match the signatures states have on file. In the first case, in New Hampshire, a federal judge determined that the state was disenfranchising voters by not informing them that their ballot had been tossed. The other case is still in court. Some high-profile voters, like former congressman Patrick Murphy, have said their ballots were not counted due to Florida's law. In other states, where Democrats have control over the process in 2019, the party might revisit whether the signature standard is a good way to validate ballots.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act. For the first time since the Supreme Court's Shelby decision, Democrats will have a majority in the House of Representatives. You can expect them to use that to try to pass a revised Voting Rights Act, arguing that the problems of 2016 and 2018 belied the court's theories that racial discrimination is no longer enough of a problem to justify the Department of Justice watching over state changes to their voting laws. While Republicans would control the Senate, Democrats believe they could put pressure on the number of Republicans facing voters in swing states two years from now.\n\nThis is going to be a fight, and the X factor is the role of conservative media, which has so far elevated any claim of \u201cfraud.\u201d Exhibit A was Saturday night's episode of \u201cJustice with Judge Jeanine,\u201d on which host Jeanine Pirro allowed Republican congressional candidate Yvette Herrell to suggest that her race in New Mexico was stolen, after some outlets called it for her, because of the existence of absentee ballots in a Democratic stronghold. Charlie Kirk, whose Turning Point USA works in concert with the Trump family's political activity, has suggested that \u201cforeign\u201d voters cast illegal votes; the only basis for that, so far, is an anecdote about one Democratic attorney objecting to a vote being tossed from a count in Florida after the voter's citizenship was questioned.\n\nTURNOUT WATCH\n\nThe total turnout estimates for this midterm have been going up since Tuesday, for the same reason that so many races haven't been called: Votes keep getting counted in rural counties and Western states. But as of Sunday, it looks like national turnout is tracking toward 49.7 percent of all registered voters.\n\nThat would be the highest turnout for a midterm election since 1914, one of the last elections held before universal suffrage. It's obviously higher than any midterm since the passage of the Voting Rights Act and since the voting age was lowered to 18. It's even higher than turnout in the 1996 presidential election.\n\nDemocrats told themselves all year that a turnout spike like that would deliver them a blowout win. It didn't, and the reason was that Republican turnout in rural areas, especially Appalachia, also blew past the norm for a midterm. In Ohio, for example, turnout rose from 40.7 percent in 2014 to at least 49.8 percent this year. In 2014, voters in the nine counties along Ohio's border with West Virginia cast 76,882 votes for Gov. John Kasich (R). In 2018, those counties cast 103,255 votes for Attorney General Mike DeWine for governor. Here's the twist: In 2006, when he lost his Senate seat to Sen. Sherrod Brown (D), DeWine lost eight of those nine counties.\n\nTo win the House, Democrats succeeded in turning cities and suburbs into turnout machines, often coming close to their numbers from the 2016 presidential election. But the Trump-era GOP has been turning its rural strongholds into turnout machines, too.\n\nAD WATCH\n\nMississippi Senate. The runoff is just 16 days away, right after Thanksgiving, and the Republican TV strategy here broadcasts total confidence. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R) has never attacked Democrat Mike Espy, or even debated him; her latest spot compares her work in the Senate to her family's cattle business. Espy's spots have been more philosophical; his latest quotes Abraham Lincoln and tells voters \u201cit's time not to forget the past, but to forgive our trespasses.\u201d With control of the Senate no longer in question, the race simply isn't seeing the kind of outside intervention that politicos speculated about.\n\n2020\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D), left, checks in to vote at the Brunswick Fire Co. No 1 in Troy, N.Y., on Tuesday. (Paul Buckowski//The Albany Times Union via AP)\n\nFour potential 2020 presidential candidates were on the ballot this week, and we now know how they did.\n\nKirsten Gillibrand. She confirmed Friday that she was looking at a 2020 presidential bid, and she had the strongest 2018 performance of any potential presidential candidate, winning 67 percent of the vote. That was less than the 72 percent she won in 2012, but Gillibrand had moved noticeably left since then. The senator ran far behind her 2012 number in western New York, but she outperformed her 2012 vote in New York City and its closest suburbs, which saw presidential-level turnout.\n\nAmy Klobuchar. She led the Minnesota DFL ticket Tuesday, winning 60.3 percent of the vote. What's notable is that this actually wasn't Klobuchar's best-ever performance; she'd run five points stronger in 2012 and carried all but two counties. The vote pattern this year demonstrated just how much the voter preferences of 2016 have hardened. Klobuchar ran about even in \u201couter\u201d Minnesota, the region outside the Twin Cities. But she scored her best-ever performance in Hennepin County (Minneapolis), from 71 percent in 2012 to 73 percent this year.\n\nBernie Sanders. As he told The Post, he's currently talking to political allies about whether a 2020 bid makes sense; today, leaders of Our Revolution, the group Sanders founded after the 2016 primaries, are huddling over their strategy. Oh, and he matched Gillibrand's numbers, winning 67 percent of the vote,\n\nElizabeth Warren. She won 60.3 percent of the vote Tuesday, improving on her first run by 6.6 points even after creating a controversy in the campaign's final weeks by releasing a DNA test to bolster her family's story of Native American heritage. Her vote held up basically across the state.\n\nREADING LIST\n\n\"\u2018It\u2019s a sea change:\u2019 CIA agent, nuclear engineer, flight attendant among the record number of women headed to Congress,\u201d by Mary Jordan\n\nMeet the new House of Representatives, with the first partisan majority that does not mostly consist of white men.

Adam B. Schiff (Calif.) is set to chair the House Intelligence Committee once Democrats take control in January. (Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nTo the long list of investigations House Democrats have planned for next year, add a look into whether President Trump used his office to try to punish companies associated with CNN and The Washington Post.\n\nIncoming Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) brought up the potential probe during an interview with Axios as an example of the type of oversight Democrats should be exercising.\n\nSchiff pointed to Trump\u2019s effort to block AT&T from purchasing Time Warner, the parent company of CNN, and his desire to get the U.S. Postal Service to increase shipping costs on Amazon, whose chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, also owns The Post.\n\n\u201cThe president is not only castigating the press but might be secretly using instruments of state power to punish them,\u201d Schiff said in an interview with The Post on Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s a great threat to press freedom.\u201d\n\nThe threat of investigation comes after the White House revoked CNN reporter Jim Acosta\u2019s press pass last week, which was seen as an escalation of Trump\u2019s conflict with the media.\n\nSuch an investigation would not go through Schiff\u2019s committee, but probably the Oversight or Judiciary panels. He said Democrats are convening this week, and he intends to raise it as a priority with his colleagues.\n\n\u201cI hold it up because it\u2019s such a clear example of the vital oversight that\u2019s been missing to make sure the president is not abusing his power,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nTrump complained that the AT&T and Time Warner merger was a consolidation of too much power. And he has claimed Amazon is ripping off the U.S. Postal Service by paying low rates.\n\nAn investigation into whether Trump\u2019s attempt to block AT&T\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner over the summer or whether his personal call on the postmaster general to double Amazon\u2019s rates in May were inspired by his fights with the media will have to compete with dozens of other pressing oversight matters.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee will focus immediately on acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker\u2019s potential conflict of interests in overseeing the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation, while the Oversight Committee has a long list, including allegations that Trump violated the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause forbidding a president from taking money from foreign governments.\n\nIn his role, Schiff said he plans to pick up the Russia investigation where House Republicans left off. Whether or not special counsel Robert S. Mueller III has wrapped up his report by January, when Democrats assume power, Schiff said, there will be important work for his committee on the issue.\n\n\u201cWe never walked away from it,\u201d Schiff said of his chamber\u2019s inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election. \u201cThat will be our intention, to finish this work, and we\u2019ll now have the power to compel people to testify.\u201d", "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, second left, and his wife Sara, left, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Moroccan King Mohammed VI, right, and Crown Prince Moulay Hassan attend ceremonies at the Arc de Triomphe Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018 in Paris.

(Frank Victores/AP)\n\nThe addition of wide receiver Dez Bryant by the New Orleans Saints made sense. Bryant needed a team, and the Saints needed a No. 2 wideout to complement top receiver Michael Thomas. As long as Bryant didn\u2019t bring along the diva act from his days with the Dallas Cowboys\u2014 and surely, Coach Sean Payton and quarterback Drew Brees wouldn\u2019t allow that to happen in New Orleans \u2014 he could have been an asset, it seemed.\n\nThere will be no way of knowing now how it would have turned out. Bryant, just signed by the Saints, saw his season end before it even started when he suffered a torn Achilles\u2019 tendon on the final play of Friday\u2019s practice. He never made his Saints debut and is eligible for free agency again this coming spring.\n\nBut it was no Bryant, no problem whatsoever Sunday for the Saints in Cincinnati. The offense just kept rolling, putting up 35 first-half points en route to a 51-14 triumph over the Bengals.\n\n[If the Eagles are going to make a second-half run at another Super Bowl, the time is now]\n\nThe Saints had 311 yards of total offense. Brees completed 18 of 20 passes for 214 yards and three touchdowns. Thomas had two touchdown catches, and tailback Alvin Kamara rushed for two touchdowns.\n\nAll of that was in the first half, after which the Saints had a 35-7 lead.\n\nThe Saints scored 28 points in the second quarter alone. The only on-field reminder of Bryant\u2019s absence came when Saints running back Mark Ingram, Kamara and Thomas flashed Bryant\u2019s trademark \u201cX\u201d sign with their arms after touchdowns.\n\n\n\nSaints wide receiver Michael Thomas celebrates a touchdown Sunday. (John Grieshop/Getty Images)\n\nThe lone negative for the Saints was the shoulder injury suffered by left tackle Terron Armstead that knocked him from the game. The severity of the injury was not immediately clear.\n\nThe Saints are, quite simply, the NFL\u2019s best team at the moment. They upped their record to 8-1. They\u2019ve won eight straight games since a season-opening loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in New Orleans that seems even more perplexing in retrospect. On Sunday, they were coming off a victory at home over the Los Angeles Rams, the league\u2019s final unbeaten team, yet they suffered no semblance of a letdown against the Bengals. The Cincinnati defense has struggled, and New Orleans took full advantage.\n\nThe Saints still might sign another unemployed veteran wide receiver, Brandon Marshall. Bryant\u2019s injury leaves them without a complementary wideout. Maybe, just maybe, that will matter at some point.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t mattered so far. Brees might not win the league\u2019s MVP award. But he is playing at an MVP level. Opposing defenses have had no answers for Thomas and Kamara.\n\nLast season, the Saints had a great chance to get back to a Super Bowl for the first time since Payton and Brees led them to a title in the 2009 season. Their upgraded running game, with Ingram and Kamara, and a greatly improved defense took some of the burden off Brees and the passing game. But their 2017 season ended one step shy of the NFC title game with the miraculous playoff defeat at Minnesota.\n\nThis season, the Saints are right back at it. Fellow would-be NFC heavyweights like the Vikings and Philadelphia Eagles have had their struggles. The Saints have avoided such missteps.\n\nThe Rams are formidable. But the Saints have firmly established themselves as, right now, the NFC\u2019s team to beat. If the conference\u2019s path to the Super Bowl goes through New Orleans, it will be very difficult for any team to go there and beat the Saints in a postseason game.\n\nThe defense and running game are doing enough. Brees remains dependable and accurate and, in this 2018 season in which playing defense has been practically banned league-wide, next to unstoppable. The Saints seemingly can score as many points as it takes to win any game.\n\nWhich NFC team could beat them? Certainly the Rams would have a chance. The Carolina Panthers, with the familiarity of being an NFC South foe, will present problems when the two teams face each other twice in December. Perhaps the Vikings or Eagles will pull things together sufficiently to be a playoff threat.\n\nBut for now, at least, the Saints are solid favorites to be the NFC\u2019s representative in the Super Bowl. They demonstrated that in emphatic fashion once more Sunday.", "\n\nAutumn fades away on Capitol Hill. (wolfkann via Flickr)\n\nWell, we did it.

The artifacts, found in a tomb in a cemetery in what would have been the ancient city of Memphis, are about 6,000 years old.\n\nMembers of the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities tweeted several pictures of the finds.\n\nIt was part of an effort, they said, to draw visitors back to Egypt after tourism nose-dived following the Arab Spring.

It was seen as a way for the dead to bring pets with them to the afterlife, archaeologist Salima Ikram, a professor at the American University in Cairo, wrote on her blog.\n\nThere were other incentives as well: Animals were buried in tombs \u201cto provide food in the afterlife, to act as offerings to a particular god and because some were seen as physical manifestations of specific gods that the Egyptians worshiped,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIn an interview with NPR, Ikram said animal mummification was the ancient-world equivalent of lighting a candle in church to ask for a blessing.\n\nAntonietta Catanzariti, a curator at the Smithsonian, said scientists have found hundreds of thousands of cat mummies over the years. The ancient Egyptians were drawn to felines' hunting prowess and their ability to protect their young.

A moment later, an unidentified man standing with Carlson grabs Granados by his collar and appears to yank him up from his seat, at which point bystanders break up the confrontation.\n\nCarlson has not disputed that the incident took place \u2014 and even volunteered that his son threw a glass of wine in Granados\u2019s face just before the video began. But the conservative news host denied assaulting Granados and accused him of provoking the scuffle by insulting Carlson\u2019s daughter.\n\n\u201cIt took enormous self-control not to beat the man with a chair, which is what I wanted to do,\u201d Carlson wrote in a statement to reporters this weekend, after Avenatti published the video on Twitter.\n\nCarlson\u2019s story\n\nIn Carlson\u2019s version of events, he was having dinner at the club with two of his adult children and some friends on Oct 13.\n\n\u201cToward the end of the meal, my 19-year-old daughter went to the bathroom with a friend,\u201d he said in his statement. \u201cOn their way back through the bar, a middle-aged man stopped my daughter and asked if she was sitting with Tucker Carlson.\u201d\n\nUpon learning she was the right-wing commentator\u2019s daughter, Carlson said, \u201cThe man responded, \u2018Are you Tucker\u2019s whore?\u2019 \u201d and called her a misogynistic slur.\n\nThe woman returned to the table crying, according to Carlson. He and his son got up to confront Granados at the bar. \u201cMy son threw a glass of red wine in the man\u2019s face and told him to leave the bar, which he soon did,\u201d reads his statement, which did not directly address the scene in the cellphone video.\n\nAvenatti, who is known for representing accusers of President Trump and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, called Carlson\u2019s statement \u201can absolute lie.\u201d\n\nHe subsequently released statements from Granados and two unnamed people he said witnessed the altercation \u2014 all of them contradicting Carlson\u2019s claims that his daughter was insulted.\n\nGranados\u2019s story\n\nIn his version, Granados was sitting with a group of friends at the bar and noticed that a woman from Carlson\u2019s table kept walking back and forth to order drinks.\n\n\u201cShe was intoxicated,\u201d Avenatti said. He said Granados had been drinking, too, and finally told the woman, without realizing she was Carlson\u2019s daughter: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re having dinner with him.\u201d\n\nA little political context: Granados immigrated to the United States from Buenos Aires, according to his biography at the Women\u2019s Initiative \u2014 a mental-health provider where he sits on the board of directors. He\u2019s also an LGBTQ rights volunteer in Charlottesville \u2014 where a protester was killed at a white nationalist rally last year. Granados sued a sports club several years ago when it refused to give him, his partner and their son a family membership, resulting in a policy change after more than 200,000 people signed a petition to support the gay dads.\n\n[How Tucker Carlson is trying to normalize Trump\u2019s response to Charlottesville]\n\nCarlson is, if not the polar opposite of Granados, at least a few time zones away across the ideological landscape. Gay rights group have repeatedly accused him of mocking their causes on his highly rated Fox News show. He has warned against the supposed danger of \u201cdiversity\u201d and demographic changes, as Politico noted. Earlier this month, a group of antifascists allegedly surrounded his house, beat on his door and terrorized his wife.\n\nGranados would hardly be the first person this year to mix politics and public dining. See: White House press secretary Sarah Sanders\u2019s aborted meal at the Red Hen; Sen. Ted Cruz shouted out of a restaurant in the District; and the Los Angeles bar that hosted a confrontation this summer between antifascists and the far-right Proud Boys.\n\nBut in a statement released Sunday through his attorney, Granados denied provoking anything \u2014 let alone insulting Carlson\u2019s daughter or making her cry.\n\n\u201cI NEVER called any member of his family any names,\u201d Granados said. \u201cI never attacked his daughter as Tucker claims. \u2026 Tucker has created this story out of thin air \u2014 it never happened.\"\n\nRather, Granados said Carlson, Carlson\u2019s son and a third man walked over to the bar after Carlson\u2019s daughter complained to them. Everyone seems to agree that Carlson\u2019s son doused Granados with wine. Avenatti said Granados threw his drink at the son in retaliation.\n\n\u201cTucker threatened me with physical violence and told me to \u2018Go back to where you came from,\u2019 before another patron started filming,\u201d Granados said in his statement.\n\n[Tucker Carlson walks back bogus South Africa scaremongering]\n\nThe 43-second video, whose author has not been publicly identified, is largely a cacophony of overlapping voices and jangling cutlery punctuated by Carlson\u2019s f-bombs.\n\n\u201cWhy should I get out of here?

You see what he did?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying there\u2019s no need for violence,\u201d the onlooker repeats.\n\n\"There will be,\u201d the man appears to say before everyone is ushered away from the bar.\n\nTwo days later, long before the incident became public, Carlson complained on a National Review podcast that he couldn\u2019t go to restaurants anymore without being cursed out.\n\n\u201cI get yelled at,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just wrecks your meal.\u201d\n\nAvenatti said he will likely file a complaint of assault and battery against the man and complaints of violent threats against Carlson and his son. Fox News has not replied to a request for comment on the accusations.\n\n\u201cI think any father can understand the overwhelming rage and shock that I felt seeing my teenage daughter attacked by a stranger,\u201d Carlson wrote in his statement this weekend. \u201cBut I restrained myself. I did not assault this man, and neither did my son.\u201d\n\nNor, he said, did he know anything about Granados\u2019s ethnicity or sexual orientation before the incident. \u201cNot that it would have mattered,\" Carlson said.\n\nCarlson said he complained to management at the country club immediately afterward, and Granados\u2019s membership was revoked after a three-week investigation.\n\nIn a statement to The Washington Post, the club\u2019s management declined to comment on the investigation but disputed \u201cinaccurate allegations being spread by individuals who were not present during the incident, and whose interpretation of events are refuted by the accounts of multiple eyewitnesses.\u201d\n\nThe club did not identify the witnesses its investigators spoke to. Neither did Avenatti, who provided statements from two people he said were at the bar and never heard Granados insult Carlson\u2019s daughter.\n\nAvenatti did confirm his client\u2019s membership was revoked last week. He blamed Carlson.\n\n\"There\u2019s no question he\u2019s attempting to use his notoriety and influence to have this man excluded from the club,\u201d the lawyer said.\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018Castrate their corpses,\u2019 professor says of GOP senators.

We will get through this. There are even hidden boons.\n\nFrom here to next decade and beyond, we\u2019ll be able to use this situation to swat away that argument that turned up the past two Decembers when conference non-champions reached the College Football Playoff. This argument goes that conference championships are paramount, especially in any proposed eight- or 16-team playoff. Does a four- or five-loss conference champion such as 2012 Big Ten winner Wisconsin, 8-5 preceding its bowl game, belong in a playoff? As one late, great American used to put it: horsepucky.\n\nBetter yet, we can use these cases to dip into the heartstrings and extol the art of the in-season turnaround, one perfected this autumn by Northwestern (6-4), Pitt (6-4) and Arizona State (6-4). Not everybody can be Clemson, even if Clemson does provide similar lessons \u2014 see below \u2014 but these non-playoff seasons can maintain great value.\n\nWhen Northwestern\u2019s season stood at 1-3 with a loss to Akron tucked in, who but those with Northwestern football lockers knew the thing could veer all the way to a storybook November catch in Iowa? When Pitt\u2019s season stood at 2-3 with obliterations by Penn State and Central Florida and the only loss anybody has taken all season to North Carolina, who but the Panthers knew the ride could reach November as a rushing machine destroying the two Virginias? And when Herman Edwards\u2019s Arizona State dipped to 3-4 after opening headily at 2-0, who knew?\n\n[College football winners and losers: Bedlam, Northwestern and a lot of chalk]\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want it to be remembered as my play. I want it to be remembered as a great team win, because that\u2019s what it was.\u201d\n\nSo said Northwestern wide receiver Bennett Skowronek after his brilliant, lunging, left-armed, 32-yard touchdown catch with 9:27 left pushed the Wildcats ahead of Iowa for good by 14-10, which became the very November final score. This seems an opportune time to remember that on Sept. 15, not that long ago, Akron cornerback Alvin Davis returned interceptions 97 and 50 yards for touchdowns, while his teammate, a linebacker gloriously named Ulysees (Gilbert III), scored on your basically sad zero-yard fumble \u201creturn.\u201d Those things fed Akron\u2019s 36-point second half, more points than it has scored in any entire Football Bowl Subdivision game this season.\n\nYet Northwestern sustained football operations against the better judgment of many, and on Dec. 1, it will turn up in Indianapolis opposite either Ohio State or Michigan, the latter of which Northwestern led by 17 points Sept. 29 before fading, 20-17, its lone Big Ten loss somehow. Merely six weeks after that and after 1-3, Northwestern Coach Pat Fitzgerald wore a \u201cBig Ten West Champions\u201d cap and said, \u201cI can\u2019t take credit for being prepared [with the cap]. I\u2019ve got to give credit to our equipment staff,\u201d whereupon he extolled guys named \u201cCurtis\u201d and \u201cEric\u201d and \u201cMikey.\u201d \u201cOn Friday, they told me that they had brought the stuff, if we won, would I like to use it?\n\n\u201cAnd I said, \u2018Absolutely.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s just persistence.\u201d\n\nSo said Pitt Coach Pat Narduzzi on Saturday, six weeks after the Panthers finished getting stomped, 45-14, at UCF on Sept. 29, the 17th of UCF\u2019s 22 consecutive wins. Back then, so long ago, the fourth-year coach felt baffled about matters such as how a program accustomed to scant penalties could be committing 14 against Penn State and 11 against UCF. Other observers proceeded to forget about Pitt.\n\nAfter four victories plus a narrow loss at No. 3 Notre Dame, a 229-yard rushing game from Darrin Hall on Nov. 2 against Virginia, a 235-yard rushing game from Qadree Ollison on Saturday in the 52-22 romp past Virginia Tech, a 186-yard rushing game from Hall against Virginia Tech and a position needing a win over Wake Forest on Saturday to reach the ACC title game against Clemson, Narduzzi told reporters, \u201cIron sharpens iron, and I think that\u2019s really where our kids are.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t lose sight of this: We\u2019re playing because we\u2019re building something.\u201d\n\nSo said Edwards on Saturday, a reminder that nobody knows what iron-sharpening goes on behind the scenes. So Arizona State\u2019s fine three-game rebound through Southern California, Utah and UCLA made its way to something considerable: the 15-play, 80-yard, eight-minute, fourth-quarter drive that pretty much clinched the eventual 31-28 win over UCLA.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know how long the drive was until I looked up after we scored,\u201d Sun Devils offensive lineman Cohl Cabral said, and maybe that\u2019s how iron sharpens iron, with its head down, plodding forward.\n\n[Beat goes on for No. 2 Clemson, which handles Boston College]\n\nAround Boston on Saturday night, a long-term example of same played again. Dabo Swinney, the decorated Clemson coach with a national title, a national runner-up finish and still another playoff berth, went to a corner of Alumni Stadium at Boston College to greet the gathered Clemson travelers in the stands. Together, they are having themselves quite a moment, and that moment keeps expanding.\n\nTen years prior, a Clemson team limping along at 3-4 went to that very stadium with an interim coach in his second game. It led 17-0. Then it trailed 21-17. Then with momentum clearly getting spiteful, future NFL player C.J. Spiller returned the ensuing kickoff 64 yards to the Boston College 15-yard line. Clemson won, 27-21, and had it not, might the interim coach Swinney have met the ax? Instead, here Swinney and the Tigers were 10 years on: 10-0 this year, 50-4 across the past four seasons, 82-11 across the past seven, players inbound from all around.\n\nSo on one side of an interview room there\u2019s Jackson Carman, a prized 6-foot-6 lineman from Ohio, saying, \u201cI really do think we are held to a higher standard in everything we do, whether it\u2019s, like, picking up the trash after we leave the movie theater, or whether it\u2019s finishing through the whistle on drills.\u201d\n\nOn the other side, there\u2019s Tanner Muse, a safety from North Carolina, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like when you sign the dotted line, you know you\u2019re coming to a great program, but this has been beyond belief from what you signed up for. And it\u2019s awesome.\u201d Still, 50-4 is \u201cunrealistic, to be honest with you. I mean, it just sounds like a game, a PlayStation game.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt amazes you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\nAnd near this other wall, there\u2019s Trevor Lawrence, a top-ranked recruit and 6-foot-6 freshman quarterback with beyond-freshman aplomb. Said one of the Tigers\u2019 co-offensive coordinators, Tony Elliott, \u201cHe continues to do a lot of things that the average fan may not recognize.\u201d Said the other, Jeff Scott, \u201cSome of his best decisions were some of his throwaways.\u201d Said Lawrence, as to whether he felt nerves before the big test, and paraphrasing here: no.\n\nTen years on, it\u2019s a bastion of football maturity. Swinney reminisced some. Five players from that 2008 game man his staff. Spiller tagged along to Boston as a guest of honor. It all goes to show again how you never know what might lurk within some apparent dud of a season.", "\u201cAnna\u201d will not stop calling. She really, really wants to sell you health insurance.\n\nWhat a lot of consumers really, really want is to smack Anna upside her robo-calling head.\n\nWith health insurance open-enrollment season underway, automated phone calls offering Affordable Care Act or other health plans are spiking \u2014 and driving many consumers to the brink. California residents may have it worst, because its open-enrollment period is twice as long as in other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s at epidemic levels at this time of year,\u201d said Aaron Foss, founder of Nomorobo, who estimates his spam-call-blocking service, based in Long Island, headed off more than 850,000 health-related robo-calls in October alone \u2014 nearly five times the interceptions for September.\n\nNomorobo tracked about 820 different robo-call pitches for health insurance in the last week of October. More than 100 of them were from the robot Anna.\n\nAlmost all of these calls are illegal, according to rules published by the Federal Trade Commission in 2009. Many offer skimpy health plans that do not cover what you might need, insurance regulators and consumer advocates say. Others, they say, are downright fraudulent, with unscrupulous insurance \u201cbrokers\u201d taking payment and promising insurance that never comes through.\n\nAlice Cave, 62, a retired data analyst from Alexandria, Va., who spends winters in Tucson, said she has gotten so many of these calls that she typically will not answer her phone unless she recognizes the number. Recently, expecting a call from a California reporter, she answered her cellphone.\n\nIt was \u201cAnne.\u201d (Anna\u2019s robot cousin? Other relatives include \u201cJordan,\u201d \u201cAllison\u201d and \u201cMandy,\u201d although variants on Anna remain most prevalent.)\n\n\u201cShe was saying, \u2018I really need to talk to you \u2014 we\u2019ve got deals on health insurance.\u2019 I thought, \u2018God, what a crock,\u2019 \u201d Cave said. \u201cIf it\u2019s too good to be true, it probably is. Anything that comes in on the phone, I\u2019m going to be skeptical. Why would they offer me this deal? I already have great insurance. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nSome fed-up consumers try to stymie robo-callers, with amusing results. Twitter user Jon Heise in June confounded his robot by insisting, after whatever it said, that he was a \u201cmeat popsicle.\u201d Eventually, it hung up.\n\nIt\u2019s not all fun and games. The California Department of Insurance is investigating health insurance robo-calls, said Janice Rocco, deputy commissioner for health policy and reform. In late August, the agency filed a court order against Health Plan Intermediaries Holdings, accusing the Florida company of deceptive and misleading practices in selling \u201cObamacare\u201d plans that did not comply with the health law. The company could face fines of up to $10,000 per violation, Rocco said.\n\nIn this case, the company\u2019s robo-calls featured \u201cAnne,\u201d according to the court order. In its legal response, the company did not admit to the agency\u2019s allegations and denied responsibility. A hearing date has not yet been set, Rocco said. (Arkansas\u2019 insurance commissioner issued a cease-and-desist order against the company in 2016.)\n\nUnder federal law, calls using prerecorded messages are legal only for such things as doctor appointment reminders, flight cancellations, credit card fraud alerts and political candidates. Calls to sell products and services are not.\n\nIn a typical robo-call sales pitch, a friendly female voice comes on the line. Sometimes the call appears to originate from major insurers such as Blue Cross Blue Shield or Aetna or from a local number a caller might suppose is a school or neighbor.\n\nOften, the voice will ask the consumer to dial \u201c1\u201d to enroll or \u201c2\u201d to opt out of future calls. Both options can be a trap, experts say.\n\n\u201cIf you pick up, you become a lead that\u2019s sent to health insurance agents or brokers,\u201d Nomorobo\u2019s Foss said. And option 2 doesn\u2019t put you on a do-not-call list; it merely lets the spammers know they\u2019ve hit a working number, he said.\n\nA reporter from Kaiser Health News connected with one of the insurance brokers behind one of these robo-calls by pressing the dreaded \u201c1.\u201d\n\nA man identifying himself as \u201cRay Khan\u201d said he is a licensed insurance broker and provided a National Insurance Producer Registry number. The reporter was unable to locate Khan in that national registry with that number, which was not assigned to anyone.\n\nKhan asked for the reporter\u2019s Social Security number and other personal information. He said he did not have an office and that enrollment needed to be done over the phone. He referred the caller to a website that does not provide information about plans offered but is a platform for consumers to be contacted by brokers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate company. We work for different insurance carriers,\u201d Khan said. \u201cYou have to trust someone if you want to do it.\u201d\n\nThat is what you shouldn\u2019t do \u2014 trust folks who call you out of the blue, Rocco said. \u201cSomeone selling a comprehensive medical plan is not going to be reaching you via a robo-call,\u201d she said.\n\nMost of what is sold through these automated calls are \u201cskinny plans\u201d that don\u2019t comply with ACA requirements, or are short-term insurance plans, which typically offer coverage for only a few months and often don\u2019t cover preexisting conditions or prescription drugs. Such plans have been outlawed in California, starting Jan. 1.\n\nDespite state and federal crackdowns \u2014 some involving multimillion-dollar fines \u2014 robo-calls aren\u2019t going away anytime soon. So the best thing for consumers to do when they receive one is to just hang up or, like Cave, not respond to unfamiliar numbers, advises the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nInstead, check out the Obamacare exchange, healthcare.gov, or your state\u2019s marketplace.\n\n\u2014 Kaiser Health News\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service and an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nRead more\n\nThose Chinese-language robo-calls are a scam to get bank information, officials say\n\nHow to figure out Medicare and choose the right plan\n\nHow robo-callers outwitted the government and wrecked the Do Not Call list", "BRATISLAVA, Slovakia \u2014 Independent candidates won the most seats in Slovakia\u2019s local elections, while the senior ruling party of former populist Prime Minister Robert Fico suffered losses.\n\nIt was the first election since massive anti-government protests triggered by the slaying of an investigative journalist forced the collapse of Fico\u2019s government.

The feminist activist group FEMEN claimed responsibility for the protest. (Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press)\n\nPARIS \u2014 A feminist activist pretending to be a photographer managed to breach security at a huge international ceremony in Paris and disrupt U.S. Presidential Donald Trump\u2019s motorcade as part of a peace protest.\n\nWith thousands of security forces deployed around the French capital, questions swirled around how the woman and two other activists from feminist group Femen got so close to scores of world leaders gathered on the Champs-Elysees to mark 100 years since the end of World War I.\n\nPhotographers accredited by the French presidential palace noticed that a woman in their midst was using a fake identity, according to Ludovic Marin, an Agence France Presse photographer who heads the media liaison committee with the French presidential palace.\n\nThe photographers alerted French presidential officials as well as police, and the woman was led away, Marin said. However, soon afterward she dashed out onto the Champs-Elysees in front of Trump\u2019s motorcade, shouting \u201cfake peace maker.\u201d\n\nAt that point, she was detained along with two other Femen protesters in the crowds of onlookers along the Champs-Elysees. All three had \u201cfake peace makers\u201d scrawled across their breasts, according to Inna Shevchenko, one of Femen\u2019s leaders.\n\nThe three are facing charges of sexual exhibitionism, a judicial official said.\n\nShevchenko would not comment on the fake photographer ploy. She said all three arrested activists had been in areas open to the general public, and that their action was peaceful.\n\nMarin expressed concern that the woman \u201cusurped the identity\u201d of a legitimate photographer to get permission to cover the high-security event, and that this could have negative consequences for real photographers seeking permission to cover presidential events.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s office would not comment on how the woman was accredited using a false identity.\n\nA Paris police official said authorities were investigating the breach. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner sought to play down the incident, and was quoted by BFM television as saying the women were unarmed and security of the event was \u201cin no way threatened.\u201d\n\nFemen activists have breached security before at major events and staged protests in front of Russian President Vladimir Putin, former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and others.\n\nShevchenko said the point of Sunday\u2019s protest was to \u201cdenounce this hypocrisy\u201d of holding an event celebrating peace with leaders such as Trump and Putin \u201cwho represent everything but not peace.\u201d\n\nShe singled out Trump for criticism for his \u201caggressive attitude toward European leaders and hostile ideas\u201d toward multilateral cooperation.\n\nMacron also criticized the kind of nationalism that Trump espouses, but his office insisted on the importance of inviting the American president and other leaders because of their role in World War I.\n\nShevechenko dismissed the \u201csexual exhibitionism\u201d accusation as an effort by French authorities to \u201csay that women\u2019s bodies are supposed to be regarded as sexual by definition.

(World leaders also gathered in Paris.) More than 40 million paper poppies are distributed by the Royal British Legion each year, and all the country\u2019s leaders, including Queen Elizabeth, wear them.\n\nBetween 1914 and 1918, the armies of Europe faced off for war in the machine age. Along the Western Front, the fixed nature of entrenched warfare led to mass destruction on every level. At their most intense, artillery batteries could lay down 10 shells per second. Besides the flattened villages and towns, rolling farmland, forests and broad river valleys became wastelands of mud and splintered trees. In \u201cThree Armies on the Somme,\u201d military historian William Philpott speaks of an airman\u2019s view of the Verdun battlefield, describing it akin to \u201cthe humid skin of a monstrous toad.\u201d\n\nThe shelling unearthed untold millions of dormant, buried poppy seeds, which began to germinate, grow and bloom.\n\nAfter one of his comrades was killed, the Canadian field surgeon John McCrae penned the enduring poem linking the corn poppy to the slaughter of industrialized warfare. \u201cIn Flanders fields the poppies blow/Between the crosses, row on row.\u201d\n\nThe British Legion tells us that the red poppy is not a token for blood or death, but that is clearly not a universally held interpretation. Fields of scarlet blooms erupting from pummeled and blood-soaked battlefields seem the perfect metaphor for the casualties of that war.\n\nIn 2014, artists Paul Cummins and Tom Piper created an installation of 888,246 ceramic, red poppies in the moat around the Tower of London. Over four months, some 5 million people came to experience \u201cBlood Swept Lands and Seas of Red.\u201d Each poppy represented a member of the British and colonial armed forces killed in the war. Millions of combatants for other powers perished or were maimed.\n\nThe paradox of the corn poppy is that it is a wildflower \u2014 farmers view it as a weed \u2014 that is individually delicate and fleeting but capable of appearance in vast colonies. It is both strong and fragile, like all life.\n\nGardeners love poppies for their ability to bring pure, natural beauty to a cultivated setting. It is a plant that goes through a months-long dance. First, the seedlings develop into a ground-hugging rosette of gray-green leaves. When the weather warms up, the rosette rises up and expands, and from its center emerges a wirelike stem dressed in silver hairs. At the top, a little elongated bud nods in its gooseneck until the bud coverings are cast off and the blossom arches up to the sun. The petals are thin and crinkled, like silk, and soon fall away to reveal a buttonlike seedpod that a month or so later will contain hundreds of tiny ripe seeds, each smaller than a pinhead.\n\nThe wild version is bright red, but garden varieties have been selected to give a range of colors, including white, pink, rose, peach and lavender. Whatever the color, I think of the Flanders poppies every time I sow the tiny seeds of Papaver rhoeas.\n\nFor a field weed, they can be maddeningly fickle. I like to sow them in November, sprinkled like fairy dust on the soil, or even on a gravel mulch. I scratch up the ground a little. In some years, the seedlings appear soon after sowing, and in other years, in the spring. Whenever they emerge, they bloom in my garden in May in a race against the gathering heat and humidity.\n\nSometimes, only half a dozen poppies grow from hundreds of seeds scattered. I recall one year when this effort yielded no poppies. This unevenness isn\u2019t just down to poor gardening. Seed germination of this poppy is complicated and relies on several factors, including exposure to light, soil temperatures and the arrival of warm periods.\n\nIn a 2007 paper, Swedish researcher Laila M. Karlsson concluded that corn poppy seeds can behave as a winter annual in warmer climates and a summer annual in cold ones. Mid-Atlantic gardeners deal with a transitional region that puts us in both places, and neither. Our cold months are no longer reliably cold all the time, if they ever were. Warm spells in January confuse the poppy seeds, not to mention the gardener.\n\nI have learned to empty half a packet of seeds in fall, keep the remainder in the fridge until late winter and resow. These efforts generally result in a good show, one way or another.\n\nWhen they do appear, I think of my poppies imitating the poppies blowing in Flanders fields. None of my Irish forebears, that I know, fought in World War I, but the scale of its sacrifice and apparent futility must sadden anyone who thinks back to that catastrophe.\n\nThe conflict produced some enduring poetry that captured the rage, the sorrow, the loss of it all, but the poets themselves were fated. McCrae died of pneumonia in the last year of the war. Rupert Brooke died of an insect bite. Edward Thomas was killed by a shell. Wilfred Owen was machine-gunned just a few days before the end of the war.\n\nDeath could come at any time from a shell, what the poet Siegfried Sassoon called \u201cyour downward darting kiss.\u201d\n\nOn their way to hell, soldiers found untouched countryside also in bloom amid the ripening stands of wheat. Philpott gives us an Australian stretcher-bearer named Henry Freeman, who wrote of marching \u201cthrough the most beautiful country imaginable . . . wild flowers of every colour and description intermingled with the almost golden corn stretching for miles.\u201d\n\n@adrian_higgins on Twitter", "Reports indicate that President Trump is deep into the search for a new attorney general nominee \u2014 I made my case for former federal judge and Boeing General Counsel J. Michael Luttig last month \u2014 and there\u2019s great reason to be quick in the decision-making. The appointment of acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker strikes many as possibly unconstitutional and even more as an utterly unnecessary self-inflicted political wound by the president. The conclusion that there was in fact no collusion between Trump, his campaign and Russia in 2016 was widespread and growing stronger when Attorney General Jeff Sessions was fired last week. Sessions\u2019s dismissal was expected. A \u201cregular order\u201d acting attorney general would have avoided igniting conspiracy theories. Replacing Whitaker quickly could still douse those that have been lit.\n\nThe Post\u2019s Bob Woodward came on my radio show two months ago. I asked: \u201cDid you, Bob Woodward, hear anything in your research in your interviews that sounded like espionage or collusion?\u201d Woodward responded: \u201cI did not, and of course, I looked for it, looked for it hard.\u201d\n\nWhich is my conclusion and the apparent conclusion of Democratic strategists across the country, as few if any Democrats ran midterm campaigns featuring allegations of collusion.

Mueller III has found will come out, but if Woodward didn\u2019t find collusion, then no one else has outside of Mueller\u2019s office \u2014 and it would be unprecedented for such an explosive fact to stay contained inside one office inside the Beltway.\n\nSo I and many others aren\u2019t buying the \u201cWhitaker was appointed to shut down Mueller\u201d commentary. If the president had wanted to avoid testifying before the grand jury, he could have simply directed Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein to direct Mueller not to subpoena him. Trump hasn\u2019t. There is no indication that Whitaker will be dispatching orders to Mueller either. The best bet is that a wrap-up is coming quickly and will follow its ordinary course: A report to Congress. If the president was planning a confrontation with Mueller over the constitutional reach of his office, he\u2019d have sent in a heavyweight to begin with, not his former attorney general\u2019s chief of staff.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s potentially problematic appointment could have been avoided by dispatching to Justice\u2019s fifth floor, for instance, Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar or Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta as acting attorney general under the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act, and there would have been no doubt of their legitimacy under the Constitution. No action they would take would be subject to challenge in the courts as premised on an unlawful appointment. It would have been the common-sense thing to do. It\u2019s just not a good bet to risk such after-the-fact challenges to Whitaker\u2019s actions based on his not having passed over the hurdle of the Senate\u2019s constitutional \u201cadvice and consent\u201d power. So why did the president do it?\n\nOccam\u2019s razor please: The president wanted Sessions gone, and with the White House without a counsel \u2014 Donald McGahn departed and incoming counsel Pat Cipollone not ensconced, the lawyer staff dwindling and no one with constitutional chops at hand to say \u201cWhoa!\u201d \u2014 the president said something like, \u201cJust put Whitaker in charge. Good guy. We will get a new AG when I get back from Europe.\u201d Keep in mind the Senate stayed under Republican control and, whatever the results in Arizona and Florida, is going to be more conservative and Trump-friendly in the new year. The president is going to get his new attorney general.\n\nIndeed, buzz and conversations between senators whom the president trusts about the next attorney general have been widely reported and confirmed at least by Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C). The nominee is coming quickly.\n\nSo just keep in mind that what looks like a perfectly acceptable interim for a month or so to a non-lawyer, indeed even to lawyers who are not constitutional experts, could have just been an unforced error, not an elaborate plot to \u201cstop Mueller.\u201d But there were much better options for acting attorney general, and perhaps the president will adopt one of them this week.\n\nThe best option is nomination of an experienced, capable, widely admired and very tough veteran of the department. See above. Meanwhile, getting a new interim chief who is unquestionably qualified under the vacancies act and the Constitution, having previously been confirmed to a Cabinet-level appointment, is the smart move that would shut down the charges of Whitaker as Mueller muffler.", "\n\nCowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott hurdles over Philadelphia Eagles defensive back Tre Sullivan (37) during the first half of a 27-20 Dallas win Sunday night. (Matt Rourke/AP)\n\nNFL Week 10\n\nTop story lines | Injury news\n\nThis was when the Eagles were expected to begin a second-half march back to the playoffs, shaking off a disappointing start to the season. Instead, the underdog, much-maligned Cowboys marched out of Philadelphia with a 27-20 win, leaving both teams with 4-5 records, two games behind the NFC East-leading Redskins.\n\nDallas running back Ezekiel Elliott ran wild, accumulating 151 yards by averaging 7.9 on 19 carries and adding 36 yards on six catches with two total touchdowns. His quarterback, Dak Prescott, played efficiently and helped quell the cries, at least for the time being, for the ouster of beleaguered head coach Jason Garrett.\n\n[The Cowboys\u2019 win over the Eagles puts most of the NFC East in retreat]\n\n\u201cYou can imagine the way Jason Garrett, his resolve before the game,\u201d Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said. \u201cI asked him before the game, \u2018You feeling any pressure?\u2019 [Garrett replied,] \u2018It just makes me want to go out and do more to turn this thing.\u2019\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the third straight loss at home for the defending Super Bowl champions left Philadelphia\u2019s head coach questioning his squad\u2019s effort.\n\n\u201cAll of us need to look in the mirror,\u201d Philadelphia coach Doug Pederson said.\n\n\u201cAre we doing enough? Are we giving enough? You have to strain yourself to make plays. We didn\u2019t do it,\u201d he continued. \u201cEach person, each coach, each player in the locker room has to look at yourself and decide every day to give your best.\u201d\n\nThe Eagles will need to turn things around immediately. Their next game is a road date with the 8-1 Saints before they get three straight games against divisional rivals and a Los Angeles trip to play the Rams, who improved to 9-1. The Cowboys will look to continue their success away from Dallas when they play the host Falcons in Week 11.\n\nThis one\u2019s for you: The Rams entered their game Sunday with much more than football on their minds. The team has a practice facility and several players live near Thousand Oaks, Calif., where a recent mass shooting recently took place. They held a moment of silence for the victims before their home matchup with the Seahawks, and Los Angeles offensive lineman Andrew Whitworth said he would donate his game check to aid the community.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the Rams were able to bring a measure of uplift to Thousand Oaks and other parts of California beset by raging forest fires by holding off Seattle, 36-31. Running back Todd Gurley had another strong game, racking up 160 total yards and a touchdown, while quarterback Jared Goff threw for 318 yards and two scores (and later posted a widely noted tweet to Halle Berry).\n\nSeahawks quarterback Russell Wilson got back to being a threat on the ground, running for 92 yards to complement his three touchdown passes, while running backs Rashaad Penny and Mike Davis teamed up for 188 total yards and two scores. It wasn\u2019t enough to stop the Rams from closing in on another NFC West title, though, even with six games left in their season.\n\nAt 9-1, Los Angeles is now 4.5 games ahead of 4-5 Seattle, with both Arizona and San Francisco bringing up the rear in the division at 2-7. If the Seahawks lose to the Packers on Thursday, the Rams could clinch the NFC West next Monday night, when they take on the Chiefs in Mexico City.\n\nA much-needed win: The Packers needed to stop the bleeding, immediately, and they did just that in a home win over the Dolphins. After two losses to fall to 3-4-1, Green Bay pulled away for a 31-12 victory that kept it in the thick of the NFC playoff race.\n\nAaron Rodgers had been experiencing uncharacteristic issues this season with his completion percentage, but he notched a mark of 67.9 Sunday on 19-of-28 passing, with 199 yards and two touchdowns. Another Aaron, the Packers running back with the last name of Jones, was his team\u2019s standout performer, going off for 145 yards and two scores on just 15 carries.\n\nA study in futility: Another week, another desultory, low-scoring loss for the Raiders. Their futility against the Chargers \u2014 and really, for their whole season \u2014 could be summed up on a play late in the fourth quarter, when Oakland still had a chance to win the game in theory.\n\nDown 20-6 with just over four minutes left, the Raiders were forced to go for it on fourth down from the Chargers\u2019 19-yard line. But the play fizzled when quarterback Derek Carr saw Los Angeles defenders bearing down on him and threw the ball at the feet of running back Jalen Richard. Granted, there weren\u2019t a ton of great options for Carr at that point, but essentially throwing the ball away rather than, say, heaving it into the end zone just to see what would happen, seemed like an odd, depressing choice.\n\nGrounding on 4th and 5 \u2014 next level pic.twitter.com/097H58gB70 \u2014 Dieter Kurtenbach (@dkurtenbach) November 11, 2018\n\nOakland would go on to lose by that score and fell to 1-8, the NFL\u2019s worst record, pending the Giants\u2019 outcome in their Monday night matchup with the 49ers.\n\nSaints stay hot: It looked to be just what the New Orleans Saints needed \u2014 another toy for Sean Payton\u2019s mad-scientist offense.\n\nAs if Payton weren\u2019t inspired enough to whip up three-quarterback formations, Payton and the Saints landed Dez Bryant, only to lose him to a torn Achilles\u2019 tendon in practice. Not that Sunday\u2019s performance showed much need for Bryant. The Saints rang up a 51-14 victory over the Bengals in Cincinnati, setting a franchise record with 96 total points in their past two games.\n\nDrew Brees passed Brett Favre on the all-time list by passing for three touchdowns for 509. Bryant, though, wasn\u2019t far from the Saints\u2019 minds. Alvin Kamara, Mark Ingram and Michael Thomas all celebrated scores with Bryant\u2019s signature X move.\n\nBryant approved.\n\nThe Saints have not lost since Week 1 and next face the Eagles on Sunday in New Orleans. Then it\u2019s a Thanksgiving night game against the Falcons in New Orleans.\n\nWho are these Browns? The Browns now have three wins after a 28-16 victory over the Falcons. Baker Mayfield was a perfect 12-of-12 for 165 yards, two touchdowns and a perfecto 158.3 passer rating in the first half and Nick Chubb\u2019s 92-yard touchdown run is the longest in Browns history; for the Falcons, Julio Jones reached 10,000 receiving yards in his 104th game. That\u2019s faster than anyone and passes Calvin Johnson (115th game). The Browns last won three games in 2015.\n\nTitans trip New England: The Patriots slipped to 7-3 with a rather listless 34-10 loss to their old friend, Mike Vrabel, and the Titans. Brady\u2019s seven-game winning streak over Tennessee ends and he was replaced by Brian Hoyer with just over 7 minutes left in the game.\n\nThe double-digit loss was the third on the road already this season for the Patriots, who had three such defeats over the past three seasons combined. On the bright side, sort of, Brady joined Jerry Rice as the only 41-year-old NFL players to catch a pass (per ESPN).\n\nKC\u2019s defense is scary: The Chiefs defense is terrifying, but who can take their eyes off the offense? Patrick Mahomes broke Len Dawson\u2019s franchise record with his 31st touchdown pass and the Chiefs move to 9-1 with 26-14 victory over the Cardinals. Next stop for the Chiefs: Mexico City next week against the Rams.\n\nWhat\u2019s really remarkable about the Chiefs, though, is their crazy streak of winning the coin toss. Or should we say, \u201cwas.\u201d They hadn\u2019t lost a flip since the first preseason game, a span of 12 games, until Sunday.\n\nTyreek Hill celebrated his touchdown by leaping into the crowd at Arrowhead Stadium and commandeering the TV camera. Yes, that drew a flag.\n\nDoink: The Bears\u2019 10-game losing streak against NFC North teams ended with a 34-22 victory over the Lions. The biggest concern going forward may be the kicking game, with Cody Parkey\u2019s doink-fest.\n\nDOINK x4.\n\n\n\nBears K Cody Parkey hit the post on 4 misses today.\n\n\n\n(via @thecheckdown) https://t.co/cKW5CskqBK \u2014 FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) November 11, 2018\n\nLeSean McCoy runs away with it: Josh McCown vs. Matt Barkley wasn\u2019t exactly a matchup for the ages, and it was the Bills who rolled to a 41-10 victory that placed Jets Coach Todd Bowles\u2019s future in doubt. LeSean McCoy rushed for 113 yards and two touchdowns on 26 carries, topping 100 yards for the first time since last December. And the Jets? They\u2019ve been outscored 115-43 in their last four games.\n\nA win is a win for the Redskins: There was so much to like in the Buccaneers\u2019 game.

It was stated, however, that at 6 o\u2019clock Paris time, the signatures of Germany\u2019s delegates were fixed to the document which blasted forever the dreams which embroiled the world in a struggle which has cost, at the very lowest estimate, 10,000,000 lives.\n\n___\n\nLAST BLOW OF WAR\n\nWITH THE AMERICAN ARMY ON THE SEDAN FRONT, NOV. 11, 2 P.M. \u2014 Thousands of American heavy guns fired the parting shot to the Germans at exactly 11 o\u2019clock this morning.\n\nThe line reached by the American forces at 11 o\u2019clock today was being staked out this afternoon.\n\nThe Germans hurled a few shells into Verdun just before 11 o\u2019clock.\n\nOn the entire American front from the Moselle to the region of Sedan, there was artillery activity in the morning, all the batteries, preparing for the final salvos.\n\nAt many batteries the artillerists joined hands, forming a long line as the lanyard of the final shot.

The two were beloved American nurses who worked tirelessness for Red Cross in France, but committed suicide shortly after the war overs the horrors they saw. (Michel Euler, File/Associated Press)\n\nPARIS \u2014 Buried in French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s speech on the sacrifice of \u201cyoung men\u201d in World War I Sunday was a reference to the \u201cthree million widows\u201d the fallen soldiers left behind.\n\nThe role women played in the war was only mentioned in passing as dozens of world leaders, including Angela Merkel of Germany, gathered in Paris to mark a century since WWI ended.\n\nYet, war impacted women far beyond the obvious hardships of widowhood and the prospect of raising children alone.\n\nAs the nations at war mobilized their entire populations, women in every country contributed during the four and a half years of conflict.\n\nWomen not only served as factory workers, farmers, drivers, teachers and child carers \u2014 they were also sent to the front lines as volunteers and nurses.\n\nSome in Russia fought in battalions. In every warring country, they gave their lives.\n\nMany of their jobs involved danger and caused death. In Britain, women worked in factories, including in the production of weapons \u2014 a key role, given that the side that could produce the most weapons in the war of attrition would ultimately win.\n\nBy 1917, munitions sites, which mostly employed women workers, produced 80 percent of the weapons and shells used by the British Army, according to historian A. V. M. Airth-Kindree.\n\nShe said some female workers in Britain were known as \u201ccanaries\u201d because they had to handle TNT, which caused their skin to turn yellow.\n\nAround 400 women in Britain died from overexposure to TNT during WWI, according to estimates.\n\nAmong the Allies, organizations such as the Red Cross depended on thousands of female volunteers.\n\nBy June 1918, there were over 3,000 American nurses in over 750 in hospitals in France, as many more served in the Nurse Corps in the US army and naval.\n\nAs nurses, it was common for them to be sent to the front line and witness its horror first hand. One solemn reminder of that lies in the headstones of the Cromwell twins at the Suresnes American Cemetery that US President Donald Trump visited Sunday.\n\nThe two were beloved American nurses who worked tirelessly for the Red Cross in France. They survived the war only to commit suicide in 1919, it\u2019s believed, due to the trauma.\n\nWhile most countries banned women from fighting, Russia was the sole country to allow them in combat, from 1917.\n\nOne female combatant, Maria Bochkareva, founded Russia\u2019s \u201cWomen\u2019s Battalion of Death,\u201d recovered from injuries and became a decorated commander.\n\nDespite the inequities, the war period was a key moment in the women\u2019s movement as it marked the first time on a wide scale that women realized their roles could be beyond domestic.\n\nDuring Sunday\u2019s ceremony, a letter written by Denise Bruller to her soldier fianc\u00e9 Pierre Fort was read out, speaking of her emotion and anguish at the end of the war that caused \u201cupheaval to the very depths of my being.\u201d\n\nLove and emotion were very much part of the war \u2014 and its propaganda \u2014 and such stories help color the narrative of loss. Less mentioned, but perhaps equally commonplace, was the sleeves-rolled-up grit displayed by female civilians during WWI\u2019s bruising slaughter.\n\n___\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press\u2019 WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___\n\nWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition.

The commemorative event marks the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Armistice which ended the First World War. (Danny Lawson/PA via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nPARIS \u2014 William Kearsey\u2019s war was long over by the time his son ever heard about it.\n\nBy then, the World War I veteran had undergone 28 surgeries to knit back together the bones and flesh of his face, which was shattered in a trench in Belgium in 1917.\n\nA century after fighting in the first war of its kind ceased, Kearsey\u2019s son, Peter, stood on a rain-soaked avenue in Paris on Sunday to honor the armistice that ended the war his father and so many other soldiers endured.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s appropriate, really, like what they went through in the trenches. It was raining and very muddy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s raining today, 100 years later.\u201d\n\nKearsey and his wife traveled to Europe to tour World War I battlefields \u201cto honor the lost.\u201d\n\nOfficial commemorations held to mark the 100th anniversary of the agreement between the Allies and a defeated Germany that silenced guns on the Western Front have provided an opportunity to contemplate the implications of the first war of its kind.\n\nBut for the children and grandchildren of soldiers who were injured or killed in more than four years of brutal fighting, the centennial offered a moment to reflect on the enduring toll of decisions made by world leaders very much like the presidents, prime ministers and kings also standing in the rain.\n\nIn central London, thousands of people marched in a \u201cpeople\u2019s procession\u201d to honor fallen soldiers. Descendants of many veterans attended the march , which was described as an expression of gratitude for those who fought in WWI and other conflicts.\n\nParticipants passed central London\u2019s Cenotaph war monument, where senior members of Britain\u2019s royal family and national leaders had placed wreaths earlier in the day.\n\nAmong them were Marion Lewis and Dorothy Heslop, sisters who said they wanted to honor their grandfather. Pvt. John Waters who suffered a severe head wound during World War I while fighting in France.\n\n\u201cThey did not expect him to survive, so they left him outside the medical tent and we think it\u2019s the cold that probably saved him,\u201d Heslop told Britain\u2019s Press Association.\n\nGrowing up, they said, it was an unspoken rule not to ask granddad about the war.\n\nOliver Davies was a 21-year-old driver for the Royal Engineers when he was hit by a stray bullet while taking animals to water near Jerusalem in 1917. His family still has the letter from Davies\u2019 captain informing his mother of his death.\n\nHis great-grandniece, Jackie Sheridan, attended the London march.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very proud moment to represent my family who are descendants,\u201d Sheridan said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be emotional to see everybody here, knowing there\u2019s 10,000 of us.\u201d\n\nAs for William Kearsey of Australia\u2019s 33rd Battalion, he survived the trench in Belgium hit by enemy fire because of a friend who dragged him out. But coming home with severe damage from the first war to use industrial-era war equipment like machine guns, Kearsey faced a new hell.\n\nHis injuries included lost sinuses and tear ducts. But years of surgery in Britain and South Wales gave the veteran another chance at life, Peter Kearsey said of his father, who died in 1971.\n\n\u201cHe was a kind, gentle man. He suffered a lot right up till his death,\u201d the son recalled.\n\nSome 62,000 Australians died on the battlefields of the Great War, and 150,000 were injured, according to Kerry Neale of the Australian War Memorial. She stood with Peter Kearsey and his wife in the rain.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t talk of the fighting, except how he was saved by his best friend,\u201d Kearsey said.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nAs of this writing, the Senate races in Florida and Arizona are too close to call. Both states\u2019 election officials are attempting to count all the votes, which is what one does in a democracy. Senators from the respective states are weighing in, one bolstering confidence in the election process and the other irresponsibly spreading rumors and undermining confidence in democratic elections in a manner that would impress Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn Arizona, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) called out President Trump and others in his party for intimating that election officials were \u201cstealing\u201d the election from Rep. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) He tweeted:\n\nThere is no evidence of \"electoral corruption\" in Arizona, Mr. President. Thousands of dedicated Arizonans work in a non-partisan fashion every election cycle to ensure that every vote is counted. We appreciate their service. https://t.co/Xtd5Vd0gSu \u2014 Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) November 10, 2018\n\nRepublican Gov. Doug Ducey also kept his cool. (\u201cWe often hear the phrase: Every vote matters. And the [Arizona Senate] race is proof. So let\u2019s get this right. All legally cast votes MUST be counted. Lawful votes in EVERY county in the state MUST be counted. \u2026 Let\u2019s follow the law, count the votes, prevent any cheating, and heed the will of the voters.\u201d)\n\nThis is nothing out of the ordinary for Arizona. The Associated Press reports, \u201cEvery election, it takes weeks for Arizona to count its ballots. But as the Democrat in the tight U.S. Senate race there jumped into the lead in the latest results some Republicans have raised baseless allegations of fraud.\u201d The report continues:\n\nState law requires the envelope [on mail-in ballots] to be sealed and signed, and for elections officials to match each signature to the one on file with the voter\u2019s registration before even opening the envelope. In this election, that\u2019s about 1.7 million individual signatures that had to be confirmed, one-by-one. A total of about 2.3 million votes were cast in Arizona. The problem comes in the final days when the ballots flood election offices. Voters can also drop off sealed mail ballots on Election Day, adding to the pile. Those ballots can\u2019t be counted that day because the elections office is busy setting up and administering in-person voting.\n\nArizona\u2019s Republican secretary of state put out a statement admonishing conspiracy-mongers. \u201cArizona takes elections seriously \u2013 from the poll workers to the county elections officials, and the Secretary of State\u2019s office. Everybody is working diligently to tabulate all of the election results in a manner that Arizonans can be proud of and, most importantly, trust the results.\u201d That would not include Trump, it seems. Thankfully, conscientious state officials, not the White House, will do the vote counting.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop national Republicans from engaging in shameful conduct, questioning the vote counting based on not a shred of evidence of wrongdoing. Former aide to the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) Mark Salter admonished the effort via tweet:\n\nStop doing this, NRSC. McSally is losing fair and square, and she\u2019s underperforming in more than Maricopa. The race is almost certainly lost and nothing will change that. All this does is poison our politics more. Despicable. https://t.co/b5ma1o0ikD \u2014 Mark Salter (@MarkSalter55) November 10, 2018\n\nThe GOP dutifully dumped opposition research on the elected Democratic Maricopa County recorder, Adrian Fontes, a former Marine. (Fox News of course dutifully fanned the conspiratorial flames.)\n\nMeanwhile, in Florida, Republican fear-mongering went into overdrive. There, Gov. Rick Scott (R), who is also the Senate candidate in a too-close-to-call race, is crying foul, alleging that the election operation he has had eight years as governor to improve is out to steal the election for his opponent, Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.).\n\nIn his frantic remarks Thursday, Scott decried the vote-counting process, His sweaty appearance and hysterical verbiage inadvertently gave viewers the impression he was less than confident about how the vote-counting will go. (If actual wrongdoing occurred, Scott, as governor, could fire state employees; he has not done that, lacking any factual basis for his charges.)\n\nFew observers would say that Broward County election officials have performed flawlessly over the years. But there is zero evidence of efforts to suppress or change votes. (Hey, this isn\u2019t Georgia.)\n\nNaturally, Trump wasn\u2019t bothered by lack of evidence of deliberate wrongdoing. Instead, as is his habit, he fanned the conspiratorial talk. Florida law enforcement, however, was having none of it. CNN reported:\n\nGretl Plessinger, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement spokesperson, told CNN that the department reached out to the Florida Department of State to offer their assistance with any investigation involving the collection and tabulation of votes in the 2018 election. On Friday morning, the Department of State informed the law enforcement agency that they have received \u201cno allegation of criminal activity\u201d thus far as it relates to the election. The Florida secretary of state is Ken Detzner, a Republican appointed by Scott. Plessinger went on to say that because of the message from the Department of State, her agency is not actively investigating anything related to the election, including the officials in Broward and Palm Beach counties.\n\nThat did not stop Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) from piling on. Unlike his colleague Flake, Rubio has no qualms about undermining the credibility of an election and stirring up the Trump cult. Rubio was perfectly willing to parrot Trump\u2019s groundless accusations and add his own baseless allegations of wrongdoing. Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.), in an op-ed in the South Florida Sun Sentinel, decried Republicans\u2019 outbursts:\n\nSince Election Day, Senator Marco Rubio and Governor Rick Scott have spouted conspiracy theories, requested law enforcement investigations to harass elections officials, and filed lawsuits to cloud the vote counting process in suspicion. These are acts of desperation and show that Republicans are afraid of what will happen if every Florida vote is counted. Marco Rubio should remember that he is our U.S. Senator and is supposed to be representing every Floridian. His post-election tweets were irresponsible and are intended to slowly erode confidence in the results. He baselessly claimed that Democrats \u201care here to change the results of election,\u201d and that lawyers will \u201ctry to steal a seat in the U.S. Senate and Florida Cabinet.\u201d\n\nRubio pulled back a bit Friday, saying he just wanted all the legal ballots counted. However, his fundraising emails tell a different story. In one fundraising email blast on Saturday, he declared, \u201cMartha McSally is in a knockout Senate battle with Kyrsten Sinema, and 350,000 votes still need to be counted. Democrats will do whatever it takes to change the results of this election and claim their \u2018blue wave\u2019. . . . The Democrats have an army of attorneys prepared to do whatever it takes to overturn Martha\u2019s victory and send Sinema to do their dirty work in the Senate.\u201d (Emphasis in the original.)\n\nNevertheless, as votes are counted \u2014 properly counted \u2014 Sinema\u2019s lead increases. When Sinema gets to the Senate, as seems likely, she should pull Rubio aside and ask why he tried to raise money off deceitful smears that undermine faith in our democracy. What\u2019s he got against free and fair elections?\n\nIlliberal regimes such as Russia over the years have been doing their best to create uncertainty in Western democracies (both in the United States and Europe) about the legitimacy and reliability of elections. However, if Trump, Scott and Rubio are going to undermine the validity of U.S. elections, Putin need not bother to exert himself. (In Soviet days they used to call gullible helpmates who harmed their own democracies \u201cuseful idiots.\u201d)\n\nLet\u2019s hope the GOP\u2019s post-2018 election antics aren\u2019t a warmup for 2020. Republicans need to understand that a fundamental tenet of democracy is willingness to accept the results of elections, no matter how close. With the exception of Flake and Ducey, Republicans conduct is despicable and should be condemned by democratic (small \u201cd\u201d) patriots.\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: Three days later: Hey, Republicans really did get clobbered\n\nJoe Scarborough: Trump lost.

They found porcelain globes in the water and clay pots in the sand. Under piles of wood, Frost and her friends found tiny ceramic pumpkins with small succulents still inside.\n\n\u201cOh, look, one of my birds,\u201d she said one recent evening, as she spotted a flamingo-shaped lawn decoration in a pile of debris.\n\nShe had no idea what she\u2019d do with what she found. There was practically nothing left in Mexico Beach but vacant lots, sand and shimmering water. This was a small town of 2,000 beloved by its residents and business owners who, like Frost, were determined to rebuild and restore it. They just didn\u2019t know how.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants to know what you\u2019re doing, but you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d said Frost, 62. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a home. You don\u2019t have a business. You don\u2019t have an income.\u201d\n\nChange here is now inevitable, in a community that didn\u2019t want to change. T-shirts proclaimed this place the state\u2019s \u201cMayberry,\u201d the antidote to mascot-branded Floridian commercialism. Residents now fear developers will buy out desperate property owners and build high-rises and golf courses that would change the community\u2019s character. Such revivals happened in Mississippi beach cities wounded after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nIn many cities, more development would be welcome. But the town council here actively worked to keep things simple.\n\nThey restricted commercial buildings to no higher than 48 feet; homes, no higher than 32. They instituted rules against developers stringing together vacant lots, preventing massive properties that were long or high.\n\nTwo years ago, developers sought an exception to those rules when they proposed building a hotel on consecutive lots. Residents launched a social media campaign to shut them down. The council sided with the residents.\n\nIn Michael\u2019s aftermath, Frost wondered whether it would be so easy for the council to be so cavalier. Residents had little clue how much they would get from private insurance or from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. She rented her building and hasn\u2019t been able to get in touch with property owners. Her desire to stay was clear, but the path to achieving it was uncertain.\n\nAs she searched for old pots on this evening, a sunburned man with Michelob Ultra in his hand approached her. He began a now-familiar conversation about how much the town had lost, and stared at a now-familiar scene of blown-out buildings and mounds of rubble. This time, inside that pile, he saw something unusual.\n\n\u201cIs that my boat?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt could be?\u201d she said. \u201cI found some of my old building over there. You can tell because the wood is made of teal.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe I could save my boat,\u201d he said.\n\nHe ran across the street and stared in the rubble for a few minutes. His boat was inside the pile, but he didn\u2019t try to dig it out.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the use?\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t save it. At least I know it\u2019s there, I guess.\u201d\n\n'I'm coming back'\n\nNearly a month after Hurricane Michael, Mayor Al Cathey said that his town is trying to remain optimistic. Cellphone towers are up and the local energy provider has dispatched 250 trucks and 500 workers to replace every downed power line. It will take another two weeks until the entire town has power again, Cathey said. The water is not drinkable, but it is now running through the faucets and can be used for showering and cooking.\n\nNo one has yet to do an estimate of damage, Cathey said, and no one has any practical idea of what redevelopment plans might look like.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to see how new building codes affect construction,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are still a lot of blanks we need to fill.\u201d\n\nThose sentiments seemed familiar to John Kelly, the city administrator in Gulfport, Miss., a city of 70,000 that was decimated by Katrina. Back then, Kelly said, the city received more than $250 million from FEMA to rebuild sewer lines, restore power grids and repave roads. Repairing infrastructure took more than a year, Kelly said, but the improvements then lured businesses that built new casinos, local restaurants and then reimagined downtown as a vibrant tourist attraction.\n\nAlong the way, Kelly said, the city invited residents to a workshop to give input about the future of the city, which helped boost morale.\n\n\u201cIt was more therapeutic than anything else,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cBut when you\u2019ve been hit by something like a natural disaster, you need something to hold on to \u2014 to make you feel like you can help.\u201d\n\nCathey felt his city didn\u2019t need workshops to determine its future. Everyone wanted the place to hark back to its past.\n\n\u201cThe founding families used to say we are strong of mind, strong of back and strong of heart,\u201d Cathey said while he stood outside his hardware store, now a jumble of wood and wires. \u201cWe aren\u2019t trying to make a show and be something we aren\u2019t. Families here didn\u2019t need a Ferris wheel or bumper cars, or the hustle-bustle. We\u2019re old Florida here.\u201d\n\nHe paused.\n\n\u201cBut there is going to be a significant visual change for the place,\u201d Cathey continued. \u201cThose old beach cottage homes that have been passed down for generations? They\u2019re gone.\u201d\n\nMinutes later, a gray-haired woman driving past the hardware store slammed her brakes. She was trembling when she stepped outside her car. She walked toward Cathey, tears streaming down her cheeks.\n\n\u201cI had to stop and hug the mayor,\u201d she said. She grabbed him by the arms.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going away for a while, but I\u2019m coming back,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you hear me? I\u2019m not giving up.\u201d\n\nNow, it was the mayor whose eyes were tearing up.\n\n\u201cI know there are more like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe loved what we had.\u201d\n\nFrost felt that way, too, but she had to be realistic. She needed to make money.\n\nThe business was starting to boom this year, she said, and then her husband, Jay, developed a heart aneurysm. By August, he was gone. Then came Michael, and their business was gone. Their house was, too.\n\nShe found an old empty building in the town of Eastpointwith an apartment above it that was up for sale. So she planned to use the money from her husband\u2019s death to buy the building, purchase a new cash register and begin moving the pots from the sand. She\u2019d start a new shop in a different town.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost a lot in the past year and it\u2019s still happening,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve come to peace with what I need to do.\u201d\n\nShe hoped to open a second shop in Mexico Beach when the time is right. She couldn\u2019t will it, but she still hoped, one day, that the town would come back. And when it does, she\u2019d be back, too.\n\n'Forgotten forever'\n\nThis is the Mexico Beach that Chris Maday knew: He ate breakfast at Sharon\u2019s Caf\u00e9 and dined at Mango Marley\u2019s. He was excited about the new auto shop that opened a year ago by a man who also fell in love with the same laid-back, no frills community he did.\n\nWhen Maday\u2019s children were growing up, he relished taking them to get snow cones at Tommy T\u2019s and walking with them along the pier. It was a quiet, serene place.\n\nNow trucks and excavators were picking up piles of debris, wood, brick and rubble. Police sirens blinked and blared, and spray paint was scrawled on homes the color of Easter eggs. Signs for free water and hot meals abounded.\n\nCars constantly passed by with their windows down while passengers recorded video on their phones, mouths agape. For a city that didn\u2019t want any tourist attractions, it had become one.\n\nSharon\u2019s and Mango Marley\u2019s were now boarded-up shells. Tommy T\u2019s collapsed and the pier\u2019s wooden planks had blown away.\n\nMaday said he thought the town could restore its original identity if he helped old businesses. So he tried to help Frost find her old stuff. He was searching through the rubble one day when a woman yelled, \u201cWe found two of her pots down there! Do you want them?\u201d\n\nThe woman\u2019s name was Jane Hughes. The wave that washed away the pottery shop had also washed over the roof of her family vacation home. The water cascaded inside, pushing out the insulation and destroying everything within.\n\n\u201cOur home is gone, so we are just trying to help people,\u201d she told Maday. She gripped a faded 8-by-10 photo in her right hand, on which she had a wrist tattoo that said, \u201cendure.\u201d\n\nHughes hoped her family could endure. Her father had inherited their house across the street 11 months ago from his father.

Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), who is poised to take control of the House Judiciary Committee in January, said Sunday that he plans to call acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker as his first witness.\n\nThe hearing would focus on Whitaker\u2019s \u201cexpressed hostility\u201d to special counsel Robert S.

In his new role, Whitaker will supervise the investigation, absorbing the responsibility from Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who was overseeing it only because Sessions had recused himself.\n\nDespite his known conflicts, Whitaker reportedly has no intention of recusing himself.\n\n[Acting attorney general Whitaker has no intention of recusing himself from Russia probe, associates say]\n\nSenate and House Democratic leaders sent a letter Sunday morning to the Justice Department\u2019s ethics office outlining what they deemed Whitaker\u2019s conflicts of interest and asking the office to review his past statements and make a recusal recommendation.\n\nRep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Democrats will also determine whether Whitaker can be an impartial custodian of the Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t recuse himself, if he has any involvement whatsoever in this Russia probe, we are going to find out whether he made commitments to the president about the probe, whether he is serving as a back channel to the president or his lawyers about the probe, whether he\u2019s doing anything to interfere with the probe,\u201d Schiff said during an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Whitaker needs to understand that he will be called to answer, and any role that he plays will be exposed to the public. We don\u2019t want there to be any ambiguity about that,\u201d Schiff continued.\n\n[Video: What Matthew Whitaker has said about the Russia investigation]\n\nNadler, however, tempered expectations about seeking the impeachment of President Trump or Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.\n\nHe said he saw \u201clots of potential\u201d for impeaching Trump but that any move in that direction would be premature until the special counsel finished his investigation. Moreover, Nadler said, he wouldn\u2019t move forward until there was enough evidence that, when presented to the American people, \u201ca large fraction of people who voted for the president will grudgingly acknowledge to themselves and others that there was no choice but to impeach the president.\u201d\n\nEarlier on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d he adopted a similarly moderate tone, saying he would be \u201creluctant\u201d to put the country \u201cthrough the trauma\u201d of an impeachment without ascertaining the facts.\n\nAs for Kavanaugh, Nadler said on both shows that his committee would launch a probe into the FBI \u201cnot doing a proper investigation\u201d of the sexual-misconduct accusations against Kavanaugh that date to his high school years.\n\nSchiff said investigations shouldn\u2019t get in the way of Democrats\u2019 pledged legislative agenda that includes issues such as health care.\n\n\u201cThe investigations are sexy. They\u2019re interesting. You bring witnesses before the Klieg lights, people tune in,\u201d he said. \u201cThe legislative process is less so. It\u2019s much less dramatic.

Pabst Brewing Company and MillerCoors are heading to trial starting Monday, Nov. 12, to settle a contract dispute in which Pabst accuses the brewing giant of trying to undermine its competitor by breaking a contract to make their products. (Ivan Moreno/Associated Press)\n\nMILWAUKEE \u2014 Pabst Brewing Company and MillerCoors are going to trial, with hipster favorite Pabst contending that MillerCoors wants to put it out of business by ending a longstanding partnership through which it brews Pabst\u2019s beers.\n\nThe case has high stakes for Pabst, whose lawyers argue that the company\u2019s very existence relies on the partnership with Chicago-based MillerCoors, which produces, packages and ships nearly all its products, which include Pabst Blue Ribbon, Old Milwaukee, Natty Boh and Lone Star. MillerCoors, meanwhile, says it\u2019s not obligated to continue brewing for Pabst and that Pabst doesn\u2019t want to pay enough to justify doing so.\n\nThe trial in Milwaukee County Circuit Court begins Monday and is scheduled through Nov. 30.\n\nPabst\u2019s attorneys have said in court documents and hearings that MillerCoors LLC is lying about its brewing capacity to break away from Pabst and capture its share of the cheap beer market by disrupting Pabst\u2019s ability to compete. At a March hearing in which MillerCoors tried to have the lawsuit dismissed, Pabst attorney Adam Paris said \u201cstunning documents\u201d obtained from MillerCoors show that it went as far as hiring a consultant to \u201cfigure out ways to get rid of us.\u201d MillerCoors has called that a mischaracterization of the consultant\u2019s work.\n\nThe 1999 agreement between MillerCoors and Pabst, which was founded in Milwaukee in 1844 but is now headquartered in Los Angeles, expires in 2020 but provides for two possible five-year extensions. The companies dispute how the extensions should be negotiated: MillerCoors argues that it has sole discretion to determine whether it can continue brewing for Pabst, whereas Pabst says the companies must work \u201cin good faith\u201d to find a solution if Pabst wants to extend the agreement but MillerCoors lacks the capacity.\n\nPabst needs 4 million to 4.5 million barrels brewed annually and claims MillerCoors is its only option. It is seeking more than $400 million in damages and for MillerCoors to be ordered to honor its contract.\n\nDuring 2015 negotiations about extending the contract, MillerCoors announced it would close its brewing facility in Eden, North Carolina, and that it eventually might have to shutter another facility in Irwindale, California. Pabst contends that MillerCoors refused to provide any information to substantiate its claim that it would no longer have the capacity to continue brewing Pabst\u2019s beers, and that it wouldn\u2019t consider leasing the Eden facility and would only sell it for an \u201castronomical\u201d price.\n\nPabst says MillerCoors wouldn\u2019t agree to an extension unless Pabst paid $45 per barrel \u2014 \u201ca commercially devastating, near-triple price increase\u201d from what it pays now. At the March hearing, Paris said MillerCoors knew Pabst couldn\u2019t accept that proposal \u201cbecause it would have bankrupted us three times over.\u201d\n\nIn court filings, MillersCoors said Pabst\u2019s proposals to keep the Eden facility open \u201cwere commercially unreasonable\u201d and that Pabst sought \u201ca windfall through litigation\u201d instead of offering to pay enough to keep a facility open. It also said the facility\u2019s closing was \u201cto ensure the longer-term sustainability\u201d of MillerCoors because thousands of new brewers have entered the market over the past decade.\n\nMillerCoors and Anheuser-Busch, which have the biggest U.S. market share at 24.8 percent and 41.6 percent, respectively, have been losing business to smaller independent brewers, imports, and wine and spirits in recent years, according to the Brewers Association.\n\n\u201cThe beer market has shifted and beer lovers are increasingly demanding more variety, fuller-flavor, and local products from small and independent producers,\u201d said Bart Watson, the Brewers Association\u2019s chief economist.\n\nOverall U.S. beer sales have declined, with shipments down from 213.1 million barrels in 2008 to 204.2 million in 2017, according to the Brewers Association.\n\nPabst depends on MillerCoors because the only other U.S. brewer with capacity to make its products is Anheuser-Busch, which doesn\u2019t do contract brewing, Paris said.\n\n\u201cIt really is an existential issue for Pabst because it has no real alternatives,\u201d Paris said at the March hearing.\n\nParis said the report from the consultant MillerCoors hired in 2013 proves the company never intended to act in good faith. Pabst\u2019s attorneys say the report had sections focused on how to \u201celiminate Pabst altogether\u201d and noted that MillerCoors would need to close two breweries \u201cto be sure they don\u2019t have excess capacity for contract manufacturing.\u201d\n\nMillerCoors\u2019 attorney, Eric Van Vugt, said in court that the company didn\u2019t rely on the consultant\u2019s report when it decided to close Eden or when it has contemplated closing the Irwindale brewery.\n\n\u201cIf we keep Irwindale open, yes, we can supply their beer,\u201d Van Vugt said. \u201cNo one disputes that.

It is my duty and the responsibility to ... create the situation for the 15 million voters in this country takes the ultimate decision by choosing their members to the Parliament through a free and fair election.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Farhan Haq, deputy spokesman for U.N.

He has called for elections on Jan.5.\n\nSirisena also sounded warning which appeared directed at Wickremesinghe\u2019s occupation of Temple Trees, the official residence of the prime minister.\n\nHe said only his new prime minister and Cabinet ministers were entitled to use state vehicles and assets at a time of transition and asked all former members of parliament to hand over such assets to the officials. He said he will deploy police to take over state assets and legal action will be taken against violators.\n\nSirisena and Wickremesinghe, who were leading traditionally opposed parties, were part of an awkward coalition government until Wickremesinghe\u2019s sacking Oct. 26.\n\nAlso on Sunday Rajapaksa left his longtime political party and joined another, in a move that could weaken Sirisena.\n\nRajapaksa joined the Sri Lanka People\u2019s Front, a party of which he was shadow leader for months. His move could weaken Sirisena\u2019s Sri Lanka Freedom Party, of which Rajapaksa had been a longtime member. A large number of SLFP members are likely to join Rajapaksa because he has the biggest following among them.\n\nHowever, both Rajapaksa and Sirisena have said they will face the Jan.5 election together.\n\nHundreds of people gathered in Colombo, Sri Lanka\u2019s capital, on Sunday for a candle light vigil protesting what they purported an unconstitutional dissolution of parliament.\n\nSeveral political parties have said they will petition the Supreme Court on Monday seeking to nullify Parliament\u2019s dissolution.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The employees had noted the specific spot where it was to measure the storm: \u201cBarometer located on second light post from Highway 98 in pier parking lot.\u201d\n\nBut there was no more light post after Michael destroyed just about everything here with a massive storm surge and intense winds when it made landfall Oct. 10.\n\nThe USGS desperately needed that sensor to make an accurate estimate of the storm surge that barreled through Mexico Beach. Eleven days after Michael hit, demolishing most buildings in this seaside town, Wilson and Segal found the shiny cylinder, propped up vertically in front of the splintered ruins of a house as if hoping someone would find it.\n\n[Tyndall Air Force Base was in the eye of the storm, and almost every structure was damaged]\n\nUsing data from that instrument and another sensor that had been nailed to a pier piling, the USGS on Oct. 25 concluded the storm surge at Mexico Beach had reached 15.55 feet, half a foot higher than the previous estimate. If you add the waves on top of the surge, the water level here reached 20.6 feet, or close to the height of a two-story building.\n\nThat\u2019s what people in the hurricane business call \u201cThe Big One.\u201d The term has nothing to do with physical scale \u2014 Michael was average-sized. But it was unusually violent, among the four most-intense hurricanes to hit the mainland United States since records began in 1851.\n\n\u201cIt might be the severest hurricane to hit the U.S. for as long as I\u2019m still alive,\u201d said storm chaser Josh Morgerman, 48, who has penetrated the core of 45 hurricanes and typhoons and survived the eye of Michael in a disintegrating Holiday Inn Express in Callaway, Fla., an eastern suburb of Panama City.\n\n\n\n\n\nMike Brennan, chief of the hurricane specialist unit at the National Hurricane Center, said Hurricane Michael was violent in two really different ways.\n\n\u201cYou had the violence of the winds, the Category 4 winds in the eyewall there, but then you had the violent storm surge that was obviously powerful enough to wipe buildings off their foundation,\u201d Brennan said.\n\nThe unlucky people of Mexico Beach suffered both the maximum winds and the maximum storm surge \u2014 the rise in ocean water above normally dry land as the storm plows ashore. In this violent zone, propped against the storm\u2019s calm eye, the forward speed of the hurricane adds to the speed of its counterclockwise circulation. The overlap maximizes the surge.\n\n[\u2018People need to come back\u2019: Future of quaint, beachfront town at risk after Hurricane Michael]\n\nIn a storm as intense as Michael, the eyewall\u2019s winds are equivalent to an EF3 tornado, strong enough to destroy solidly constructed homes and lift cars off the ground. The extreme wind damage in Panama City, on the left side of the eyewall, raises the possibility that Michael generated hurricane \u201cmini-swirls,\u201d which are like tiny tornadoes, roughly the diameter of a couple of houses, and can create momentary wind speeds in excess of 200 mph.\n\nGovernment scientists are still trying to take the measure of the historic storm. Although Michael was officially a Category 4 hurricane, with 155 mph sustained winds when it made landfall, that could potentially be revised upward, to Category 5 \u2014 157 mph and higher \u2014 in the ongoing National Hurricane Center analysis.\n\nNo one in the Florida Panhandle would be surprised by such an upgrade. To the untrained eye, the damage along this coastline looks like it came from a Category 13, what some observers likened to the effect of a nuclear bomb.\n\n\n\nBlocks sit where buildings used to be in Mexico Beach, Fla.

(Petty Officer 1st Class Colin Hunt/U.S. Coast Guard/Reuters)\n\nStrange pattern of destruction\n\nEvery hurricane has a different footprint. Florence, for example, hit the Carolinas in September as a broad, soggy Category 1 hurricane moving at a glacial pace and triggering record flooding. Michael dropped modest levels of rain but was a speed demon.\n\nMichael hit the coast moving 14 mph toward the north-northeast and accelerated to 17 mph. The eye remained well-defined, with an eyewall functioning like a lawn mower blade long after Michael made landfall.\n\nThat led to one of Michael\u2019s most stunning features: It stayed a hurricane far inland. It was still a Category 3 hurricane in southwest Georgia, the strongest storm to hit that state since 1898. Not until Michael was about 30 miles from Macon, in the center of the state, did the sustained winds drop to the point where Michael was officially just a tropical storm.\n\nScientists say climate change might be supercharging such storms, which in recent years have often intensified with unusual speed. Michael was a prime example, making landfall as a monster just three days after it was considered Tropical Depression 14 down near the Yucatan.\n\n\u201cFlorence was certainly a bigger storm, in terms of the broader windfield, but Michael was a more powerful hurricane, because of its much lower central pressure,\u201d Brennan said.\n\n\n\nThe remains of homes and buildings in Mexico Beach are seen on Oct. 13 out a window of one of the few left standing after Hurricane Michael made landfall along the Florida Panhandle. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nAt ground level, there is a strange pattern of destruction that stretches 70 miles along the storm-ravaged coast, approximately 70 miles of damage from Panama City to Carrabelle, along U.S. Highway 98. The road runs along the coast of the Florida Panhandle, sometimes through piney woods, sometimes hard against the water and built directly on top of what used to be the dune line.\n\nThe two-lane slash of pavement \u2014 initially impassable, but now open except for the stretch through Mexico Beach \u2014 is like a diagnostic tool for understanding the hurricane.\n\nA few feet of elevation marked the difference between destruction and survival, something that is evident all along Highway 98 \u2014 some stretches of waterfront battered by storm surge sit adjacent to slightly higher ground that seems almost not to have been touched.\n\nCoastal development in the Southeast United States often has challenged the forces of nature. There are homes built low, close to the water, completely unprotected. Many natural sand dunes, anchored by the deep roots of grasses and shrubs, have been destroyed in the creation of a sunny paradise. Mexico Beach had minimal sand dunes and no barrier island. It faced the open Gulf of Mexico. It was defenseless when The Big One arrived.\n\n\n\nResidents make their way on Oct. 12 across a washed-out road that faced the brunt of Hurricane Michael\u2019s power. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the case for Cape San Blas, a peninsula that emerges from the Panhandle toward the west and takes a sharp right turn into a state park. That state park is now an island, because Michael\u2019s storm surge blasted a breach in an especially narrow portion of the peninsula. Scientists hadn\u2019t seen that breach coming, said Kara Doran, the USGS coastal change hazards storm team leader.\n\nBut most of the homes along the cape survived. Many of them are new, built after Hurricane Andrew chewed up South Florida in 1992 and spurred stricter building codes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a third-generation Floridian,\u201d said Anne Hanson, whose house on the cape suffered no damage. \u201cI told the builder, build me a Category 5 house.\u201d\n\nOther factors might have attenuated the storm surge here. The cape is aligned north-south and was sideswiped by the hurricane rather than being hit flush. And the dunes, heavily vegetated, are a vestige of the way the whole coast used to look.\n\n\u201cThis still has the Old Florida natural dune system, and I think that really helped us out,\u201d said Victor Rowland, 48, manager of the Rish Recreational Park, where cottages were spared the storm surge.\n\n\n\nDowned trees are seen from the air at Tyndall Air Force base in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael near Mexico Beach, Fla. (Gerald Herbert/AP)\n\nThe powerful right side of the storm hit one of the least-populated areas in the Southeast United States \u2014 what state tourism officials call the Forgotten Coast. You can drive for miles and see nothing but pines, bent and snapped. In the early 1930s, Alfred I. duPont began purchasing huge amounts of cheap land in north Florida, and after his death in 1935, his descendants amassed more than 1 million acres, the pines harvested for a paper mill in Port St. Joe.\n\nThe mill employed thousands of workers from 1938 to the mid-1990s, and because nobody wanted beachfront condos with views of belching smokestacks, nearby beaches remained relatively undeveloped.\n\nIn neighboring Apalachicola, the local seafood industry was so productive and had so much clout that by the 1960s and 1970s Franklin County began imposing severe development restrictions: no buildings higher than three stories anywhere, no golf courses on barrier islands. For decades, Apalachicola Bay supplied 90 percent of Florida\u2019s oysters.\n\nThe paper mill is gone. Apalachicola\u2019s oyster fishery had largely collapsed even before the hurricane. The working-class base has shrunk, replaced by wealthier people from Atlanta and the entire East Coast who crave beach views. Michael\u2019s aftermath could further the trend toward a wealthier population that can afford newly constructed second homes built to Category 5 standards.\n\nTyler Matney, 38, who grew up in the Pacific Northwest, has been a local for only a year and a half. His home just a block from the bayfront in Port St. Joe was crushed. \u201cThis was not in the brochure 18 months ago when we moved here,\u201d Matney said.\n\nThe brochures might need to be updated. Brennan, the National Hurricane Center meteorologist, said Michael should remind coastal residents that \u201cyou can always be hit by a Category 4 or 5 hurricane.\u201d\n\nKevin Grimsley, a hydrologist with the USGS, was stunned by the destruction when he went into Mexico Beach two days after landfall. He was looking for those barometers, doing shoe-leather reconnaissance essential to hurricane science. All around him were the remains of houses that had been scraped from their foundations, a community that had gambled and lost.\n\n\u201cThis could have been a lot of places in Florida or the Gulf Coast or along the Atlantic Seaboard,\u201d Grimsley said.\n\nSamenow reported from Washington.", "LIBREVILLE, Gabon \u2014 Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba is recovering from an undisclosed illness in Saudi Arabia and still performing his duties, according to a statement released Sunday amid mounting speculation about his health.\n\nThe issue is a particularly sensitive one in the Central African nation. When Bongo\u2019s father died in 2009 after more than four decades in power, Gabonese officials angrily denied French media reports of his death for almost a day, and shut down the internet in the country for several hours.\n\nThe statement said that Ali Bongo was suffering dizziness at his hotel in Riyad, Saudi Arabia on Oct. 24 when he sought medical care at King Faysal Hospital.\n\nThe information about the president\u2019s health is \u201cextremely reassuring\u201d and the president \u201ccontinues to perform his duties,\u201d the presidency said.\n\nThe communique came amid a swirl of rumors over the president\u2019s health back home in the Central African nation.

His time in power, though, was dogged by allegations of corruption and the use of oil profits for personal luxuries, including properties in several European and American cities, and lavish trips abroad.\n\nAli Bongo won a special presidential election that was held a few months after his father\u2019s death. The opposition claimed it was rigged.\n\nIn 2016, protesters took to the streets of the capital, Libreville, and the Parliament building was burned after Bongo\u2019s opponent, Jean Ping, accused Bongo of vote-rigging. The European Union, the United States, and France also expressed concerns about some of the results.

Pressure to curtail U.S. involvement in the war is expected to increase in the wake of last week\u2019s midterm elections, which handed control of the House to Democrats critical of President Trump\u2019s Yemen policy.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has elevated Saudi Arabia as a premier Middle East ally, choosing it as his first foreign destination as president, touting massive arms sales to the kingdom and articulating a shared concern about Iran\u2019s support for armed groups across the region. He also reversed steps to restrict arms sales imposed at the end of the Obama administration over concerns about civilian casualties.\n\nU.S. officials say Iran has provided military support to the Houthis, including advanced technology they have used to attack Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe letter, whose signatories also included Wendy Sherman, who served as undersecretary of state, and Lisa Monaco, who was a senior White House official for counterterrorism, cited Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s decision in September to formally back Saudi Arabia\u2019s efforts to protect civilians. That decision, the result of a new congressional requirement, added fuel to criticism at a moment when disease and deprivation have spiraled in Yemen.\n\nDefenders of the policy say that Washington must help Saudi Arabia defend itself from Houthi missiles and ensure the group does not threaten commerce in waters off Yemen.\n\nIn recent weeks the Trump administration has intensified its call for a peace process to end the fighting, but critics say Washington must do more to pressure Gulf allies to make concessions.\n\nThe letter, coordinated by the advocacy group National Security Action, urged the administration to call for an immediate cease-fire, energize its diplomatic efforts to end the war and suspend U.S. aid.\n\n\u201cWe unsuccessfully tried conditional support to the coalition.

(Armando Franca/Associated Press)\n\nLONDON \u2014 Both the U.S. men\u2019s and women\u2019s national soccer teams are in Europe for year-ending friendlies, separated this week by some 400 miles and a striking gulf in their global place.\n\nWhile the men continue to operate without a permanent coach in the wake of failing to qualify for the World Cup a year ago, the top-ranked women have launched a seven-month run to defend their world championship in France next summer.\n\nIt\u2019s never fair to compare the programs \u2014 men\u2019s and women\u2019s soccer around the world vary in development, emphasis and history \u2014 but at no time in the past 30 years have the premier American teams sat in such divergent stages.\n\nFacing Scotland on Tuesday in the Glasgow suburb of Paisley, the women will attempt to cap an undefeated year and extend an unbeaten streak that began more than 15 months ago.\n\nTwo days later, in the first of two heavyweight tests, the No. 23 U.S. men will play World Cup semifinalist England at Wembley Stadium, their third visit to the sport\u2019s holy grounds. On Nov. 20, they\u2019ll close the calendar against Italy in Genk, Belgium.\n\n[USMNT roster will feature its young fab four for friendlies vs. England, Italy]\n\nThe women began their European tour Thursday with a 1-0 victory against Portugal, a lukewarm performance featuring several secondary players. Coach Jill Ellis seemed inclined to save her first-choice lineup for the Scots, who qualified for the Women\u2019s World Cup for the first time.\n\nThat match will conclude a stretch of 14 since early June, including World Cup qualifiers last month, that were stuck into FIFA windows during the National Women\u2019s Soccer League season. It will also usher in a holiday break before the team heads back to Europe for two winter friendlies, including a major test against France on Jan. 19, in Le Havre.\n\nDecember isn\u2019t uneventful, however. On Dec. 8, FIFA will conduct the Women\u2019s World Cup draw in Paris, placing the Americans atop one of the six four-team groups and setting their first-round schedule and long-term path through the month-long tournament.\n\nEllis designed the current adventure, as well as the January trip, to begin acclimation ahead of next summer\u2019s spectacle. Before playing in Portugal last week, the Americans had played 26 of their previous 27 matches at home \u2014 and the one away date was in Canada.\n\nThe only other road matches since the 2016 Olympics were in Norway and Sweden in June 2017.\n\nThe U.S. team has made the most of friendly settings: 17-0-2 this year and 24-0-3 since it lost to Australia in July 2017 in Seattle.\n\n\u201cThis is really important for us to play some of our games internationally,\u201d forward Alex Morgan said, \u201cbecause you don\u2019t know the outside factors \u2014 the fan base, the playing surface, the weather. You\u2019re not on home territory. So much is unknown.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Ellis started three Washington Spirit players (Mallory Pugh, Rose Lavelle and Andi Sullivan), as well as Emily Fox, 20, a University of North Carolina sophomore from Ashburn (Stone Bridge High School). Lavelle and Pugh are all but certain of making the 23-player World Cup roster, and Lavelle is a probable starter.\n\nMorgan, Julie Ertz, Tobin Heath and Kelly O\u2019Hara \u2014 probable starters next summer \u2014 were not in the lineup Thursday. Heath skipped the European trip because of a personal commitment and O\u2019Hara is sidelined after undergoing ankle surgery last month.\n\nIn her second national team appearance, Morgan\u2019s replacement at striker Jessica McDonald, scored late in the first half. McDonald is among a handful of World Cup hopefuls aiming to make an impression before Ellis settles on her final list in the spring.\n\nMeanwhile, men\u2019s interim coach Dave Sarachan invited 28 players for the two friendlies, probably his last stretch in charge. The U.S. Soccer Federation is expected to appoint a new coach by the end of the year, with Gregg Berhalter, a former U.S. defender who has guided the Columbus Crew for five seasons, the front-runner.\n\nSarachan continues integrating the next generation of players, calling up, among others, European-based Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Tyler Adams, a New York Red Bulls midfielder expected to move to Germany this winter.\n\nThe Americans are at the start of a new World Cup cycle, almost four years before Qatar hosts the next tournament (November-December 2022). Since their qualifying flop last year, they\u2019ve played 10 friendlies, mostly against top-shelf opponents. The next official competition does not come until next summer, the Concacaf Gold Cup.\n\nAt the moment, there is no great urgency to win. Rather, Sarachan is constructing a foundation and instilling belief and commitment, primarily with a young corps. The only experienced holdovers gaining regular call-ups have been DeAndre Yedlin, 25; Bobby Wood, who turns 26 Thursday; and John Brooks, 25.\n\n\u201cPlaying England at Wembley is the opportunity of a lifetime, and our players will have the added bonus of facing a team that is clearly on the rise as they showed with their run to the World Cup semifinals,\u201d Sarachan said. \u201cOverall, ending 2018 with these two matches really puts an exclamation point on the opportunities provided to the group this year.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nD.C.

A Myanmar government statement said an initial group of 2,251 would be sent back from mid-November at a rate of 150 per day.\n\nNoting that the actual date depended upon Bangladesh taking action, Win Myat Aye said, \u201cWhether it will happen on the day or not, we have to be ready on our side and we try our best to do that.\u201d\n\nAbul Kalam, Bangladesh\u2019s repatriation commissioner, said he was unaware that a date had been set. \u201cI have got no decision from our foreign ministry or any other higher authorities,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Rohingya exodus began after Myanmar security forces launched a brutal crackdown following coordinated insurgent attacks in August 2017. The scale, organization and ferocity of the operation led to accusations from the international community, including the United Nations, of ethnic cleansing and genocide. Myanmar\u2019s government has denied this.\n\nHuman rights advocates say conditions are not yet safe for the return of the Rohingya refugees, who have generally been denied citizenship and civil rights in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where prejudice against them runs high.\n\nThe U.N.\u2019s independent investigator on human rights in Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, last week urged a halt to \u201crushed plans\u201d for the repatriation, saying a lack of guarantees that the refugees wouldn\u2019t face new persecution if they returned home was concerning.\n\nAccording to Sunday\u2019s Myanmar government statement, the returning Rohingya would stay at repatriation camps for two days and receive food and clothing before moving on to transit camps. It said China, India and Japan were \u201cproviding necessary assistance\u201d for the repatriation process, but did not give details.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear how long the returnees would have to stay in the transit camps or where they would go afterward, as many Rohingya villages have been erased by bulldozers, with the land given to local Rakhine Buddhists.\n\nOfficials said Sunday that returnees can get an ID document called a National Verification Card that will allow them to travel anywhere in the Maungdaw area of Rakhine State. They can then begin to apply for citizenship.\n\nBut there is widespread skepticism that any returning refugees will ever be granted citizenship.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of people in Myanmar do not accept that the Rohingya are a native ethnic group, instead seeing them as illegal migrants from Bangladesh and calling them \u201cBengalis.\u201d\n\nIn remarks delivered last month at the United Nations, Yanghee Lee said the Rohingya \u201cshould not go back to ... the oppressive laws, the discrimination. The minimum they need is freedom of movement, access to basic health services.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s like an apartheid situation where Rohingyas still living in Myanmar ... have no freedom of movement,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThe camps, the shelters, the model villages that are being built, it\u2019s more of a cementing of total segregation or separation from the Rakhine ethnic community.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nIf House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) gets the support of her caucus, she\u2019ll be the first speaker since Sam Rayburn to hold the office twice. Her prodigious fundraising, singular focus on health care and determination to avoid impeachment talk were instrumental in winning suburban seats needed for a Democratic majority. She treated attacks on her with aplomb and graciously shrugged off the decision by some Democrats to distance themselves from her. Whatever it takes to win.\n\nIn contrast to President Trump\u2019s multiday temper tantrum, Pelosi was the picture of calm, focused leadership this week, saying, \u201cIn terms of working with the president, I just would say that I worked very productively with President [George W.] Bush when we had the majority and he had the presidency.\u201d (And boy, would she prefer Bush to Trump, she has said previously.)\n\nDescribing a call with Trump, she got in a zinger or two: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if he said \u2018deals\u2019 \u2014 it was very noisy in the room. There was a jubilant, jubilant crowd in that room celebrating our taking back the House. \u2026 I heard the word \u2018infrastructure\u2019 \u2014 that came through clearly. But he said that, you know, let\u2019s talk how we \u2014 I\u2019m sure we can come to agreement on some things and we have an obligation to try to find common ground.\u201d\n\nShe demurred on impeachment. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should impeach a president for political reasons. But I don\u2019t think we should not impeach him because we think it\u2019s politically\u2026 impeding for us to do so. We have to see what the facts are.\u201d She coyly noted that the left never forgave her for declining to seek Bush\u2019s impeachment.\n\nShe used her platform to state her opposition to the appointment of the conflicted and unfit acting attorney general: \u201cI don\u2019t say it\u2019s a constitutional crisis quite yet, but it\u2019s a perilous time and we will see tonight people in the streets because of this firing [of Jeff Sessions].\u201d She warned that if Trump goes after special counsel Robert S. Mueller, \u201cit would be even worse.\u201d She added, \u201cThis is a very important moment, and I hope the president is not frivolous about it. This person does not, should not be there because of the statements he\u2019s made already. The fact that it is constitutionally on weak ground is another reason. \u2026 There are plenty of qualified people he could name, who could be confirmed.\u201d\n\nThe country should be relieved and grateful that she and her fellow Democrats will be there to exercise proper oversight after two years of utterly irresponsible docility by Trump GOP lapdogs. Given that she\u2019s the most skilled speaker in recent memory when it comes to legislating (e.g., passing Obamacare, providing votes for the Troubled Asset Relief Program), she may yet get an infrastructure bill through and/or a bill to shore up the Affordable Care Act. Don\u2019t sell her short on immigration reform, either. (\u201cNow we can talk about how we can come together and put together bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d she said. \u201cIt passed the Senate, in a bipartisan way, a few years ago \u2014 but again, the speaker would not bring it up in the House. That was really a very sad thing for our country.\u201d)\n\nWhether you like her progressive policy positions or not, few knowledgeable observers or politicians would deny her political acumen. No less than Newt Gingrich recently told my colleague Karen Tumulty: \u201cNancy Pelosi is a very smart, very tough person who has earned her position by just brute hard work, by applying her intelligence and by applying a network that has sustained her for a long time. Anybody who thinks they\u2019re going to outmaneuver her is up against somebody who has spent literally her lifetime \u2026 she\u2019s been in this business forever.\u201d\n\nFor all that we can say, well done, Ms. Pelosi.\n\nRead more:\n\nKaren Tumulty: Trump is right: Nancy Pelosi should be the next speaker\n\nLetters to the Editor: Nancy Pelosi won\u2019t be the right leader for Democrats\n\nJonathan Capehart: Why President Trump makes a \u2018Speaker Pelosi\u2019 an absolute necessity\n\nLetters to the Editor: For the good of the party, Pelosi should step aside\n\nDana Houle: Nancy Pelosi is incredibly underrated", "TEHRAN, Iran \u2014 An Iranian appeals court has upheld the 10-year prison sentence of a former Foreign Ministry official convicted of spying.\n\nThe semi-official Fars news agency on Sunday quoted judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejehi as saying the court upheld Kamal Amirbeig\u2019s sentence and fined him $200,000.

But they also represented a pointed rebuke to President Trump, Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin and others among the more than 60 world leaders in attendance.\n\nSpeaking in French, Macron emphasized that a global order based on liberal values is worth defending against those who have sought to disrupt that system. The millions of soldiers who died in the Great War fought to defend the \u201cuniversal values\u201d of France, he said, and to reject the \u201cselfishness of nations only looking after their own interests. Because patriotism is exactly the opposite of nationalism.\u201d\n\n[As the world marks 100 years since the end of WWI, nationalism is on the rise again]\n\nMacron has attempted to stand as a vocal counterweight to Trump, who recently called himself a \u201cnationalist\u201d and has moved to set the United States apart from global treaties, including the Iran nuclear deal, the Paris climate accord and a U.N. program for refugees.\n\nAmid growing divisions in Europe that have strained the European Union, Macron defended that institution and the United Nations, declaring that the \u201cspirit of cooperation\u201d has \u201cdefended the common good of the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nMorocco\u2019s King Mohammed VI, far left, first lady Melania Trump, President Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron attend a commemoration ceremony for Armistice Day. (Benoit Tessier/POOL/EPA-EFE)\n\n\u201cBy putting our own interests first, with no regard for others, we erase the very thing that a nation holds dearest, and the thing that keeps it alive: its moral values,\u201d Macron said.\n\nHe denounced fringe ideologies that have become more mainstream, warping religious beliefs and setting loose extremist forces on a \u201csinister course once again that could undermine the legacy of peace we thought we had forever sealed.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe remarks came as the world leaders gathered here have sought to mark the 100 years since the war by honoring those who served and died. Among those who participated were German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May did not attend, remaining in London to preside over a war remembrance there, though she visited France last week to lay wreaths at military cemeteries and meet with Macron. Chinese President Xi Jinping also was not present.\n\n[Critics pile on after Trump cancels visit to U.S. military cemetery outside Paris, citing weather]\n\nPutin told Russia\u2019s RT network after the ceremony that he and Trump spoke during a leaders\u2019 luncheon but that a formal meeting would wait until they cross paths at the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires later this month. Putin said he and Trump agreed to a request from French officials not to overshadow the war remembrance ceremony.\n\n\u201cWe are ready for dialogue,\u201d Putin said, adding a dig at the Trump administration for announcing that the United States would withdraw from a landmark Cold War arms pact. \u201cWe\u2019re not the ones exiting the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.\u201d\n\nAhead of the ceremony, dozens of world leaders wearing black strode shoulder-to-shoulder along the Champs-Elysees toward the Arc. Military jets streaked overhead, emitting red, white and blue smoke, the colors of France.\n\nTrump and Putin did not participate in the processions. The group, which had first gathered at the Elysee Palace, had come to the Arc on tour buses along the 230-foot-wide boulevard. Bells at Notre Dame Cathedral tolled at 11 a.m., marking the signing of the armistice of a war in which 10 million troops perished.\n\nBut Trump and Putin took their own motorcades to the event and made separate entrances a few minutes after the main group. A White House spokeswoman said Trump arrived separately due to \u201csecurity protocols,\u201d though she did not elaborate.\n\nTrump and Putin shook hands with other leaders assembled on risers at the foot of the monument, and took their positions. Trump and first lady Melania Trump stood next to Merkel, while Putin stood next to Macron.\n\nThe ceremony could begin.\n\nTo the sound of a military brass band, Macron inspected French troops standing at attention and a choir sang the national anthem. Cellist Yo-Yo Ma performed a solo piece.\n\nFor Trump, dressed in a dark-blue suit and red tie, the ceremony marked the beginning of a day in which he also attended a luncheon with world leaders and then delivered a speech at the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial \u2014 a day after he skipped a visit to a different cemetery.\n\nAt Suresnes, Trump ditched an umbrella and spoke in the rain for 10 minutes, at one point joking that the crowd was \u201cgetting drenched.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is our duty to preserve the civilization they defended,\u201d Trump said of the 1,541 buried there. \u201cWe renew our sacred obligation to memorialize our fallen heroes.\u201d\n\nHe did not address Macron\u2019s speech.\n\nThe relationship between Trump and Macron has soured as the U.S. president has promoted an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy that has unsettled allies on trade and defense. Macron has sought to counter some of Trump\u2019s agenda, and he organized a three-day Peace Forum that began Sunday afternoon, just as Trump headed home to Washington on Air Force One.\n\n[The Broken Bromance? The Trump-Macron relationship is on the rocks.]\n\nFor European observers, the commemoration was a somber event \u2014 and not exclusively because of the dead it honored.\n\nIn a climate of resurgent nationalism \u2014 which has brought upheavals in Rome, Budapest, Warsaw and even London \u2014 Macron was alone on the dais, preaching the virtues of multilateralism. Merkel, his most loyal partner in that endeavor, has announced she will soon leave public life.\n\n\u201cFranco-German reconciliation was at the very heart of what we\u2019ve been seeing together,\u201d said Dominique Mo\u00efsi, a French foreign policy expert at the Paris-based Institute Montaigne and an informal adviser to the Macron campaign.\n\n\u201cBut she\u2019s out,\u201d he said of Merkel, who announced she will step down in 2021. \u201cThe spirit in which we are commemorating the events is no longer fully present.\u201d\n\nMacron\u2019s speech was full of literary allusions, including the French poets Guillaume Apollinaire and Charles P\u00e9guy, both of whom served in World War I. (P\u00e9guy was killed in combat in 1914.)\n\nSunday\u2019s address also contained a number of historical rebukes. Macron made a subtle reference to a well-known 1927 French book that decried the elites at the time, who embraced reactionary, nationalistic ideologies at the expense of a rational consensus.\n\nTaking the stage to applause at the Paris Peace Forum later Sunday, Macron avoided presenting the weekend\u2019s event as a success. Instead, he said history would remember the image of multiple world leaders whose countries were once at war gathered in peace under the Arc.\n\nThe question, Macron said, was how that image would be interpreted.\n\n\u201cWill it be the symbol of a durable peace among nations?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr, on the contrary, a photograph of a final moment of unity before the world descends into a new disorder?\u201d\n\nAnton Troianovski in Moscow contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nArmistice Day: The day the guns fell silent\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "CAIRO \u2014 A minister who served in Yemen\u2019s rebel government before defecting to Saudi Arabia was struck by a shoe hurled by a Yemeni journalist at a news conference in Riyadh.\n\nAbdul-Salam Ali Gaber, who served as information minister, is the most senior member of the Houthi administration to defect since civil war broke out in 2014.

They found porcelain globes in the water and clay pots in the sand. Under piles of wood, Frost and her friends found tiny ceramic pumpkins with small succulents still inside.\n\n\u201cOh, look, one of my birds,\u201d she said one recent evening, as she spotted a flamingo-shaped lawn decoration in a pile of debris.\n\nShe had no idea what she\u2019d do with what she found. There was practically nothing left in Mexico Beach but vacant lots, sand and shimmering water. This was a small town of 2,000 beloved by its residents and business owners who, like Frost, were determined to rebuild and restore it. They just didn\u2019t know how.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants to know what you\u2019re doing, but you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d said Frost, 62. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a home. You don\u2019t have a business. You don\u2019t have an income.\u201d\n\nChange here is now inevitable, in a community that didn\u2019t want to change. T-shirts proclaimed this place the state\u2019s \u201cMayberry,\u201d the antidote to mascot-branded Floridian commercialism. Residents now fear developers will buy out desperate property owners and build high-rises and golf courses that would change the community\u2019s character. Such revivals happened in Mississippi beach cities wounded after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nIn many cities, more development would be welcome. But the town council here actively worked to keep things simple.\n\nThey restricted commercial buildings to no higher than 48 feet; homes, no higher than 32. They instituted rules against developers stringing together vacant lots, preventing massive properties that were long or high.\n\nTwo years ago, developers sought an exception to those rules when they proposed building a hotel on consecutive lots. Residents launched a social media campaign to shut them down. The council sided with the residents.\n\nIn Michael\u2019s aftermath, Frost wondered whether it would be so easy for the council to be so cavalier. Residents had little clue how much they would get from private insurance or from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. She rented her building and hasn\u2019t been able to get in touch with property owners. Her desire to stay was clear, but the path to achieving it was uncertain.\n\nAs she searched for old pots on this evening, a sunburned man with Michelob Ultra in his hand approached her. He began a now-familiar conversation about how much the town had lost, and stared at a now-familiar scene of blown-out buildings and mounds of rubble. This time, inside that pile, he saw something unusual.\n\n\u201cIs that my boat?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt could be?\u201d she said. \u201cI found some of my old building over there. You can tell because the wood is made of teal.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe I could save my boat,\u201d he said.\n\nHe ran across the street and stared in the rubble for a few minutes. His boat was inside the pile, but he didn\u2019t try to dig it out.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the use?\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t save it. At least I know it\u2019s there, I guess.\u201d\n\n'I'm coming back'\n\nNearly a month after Hurricane Michael, Mayor Al Cathey said that his town is trying to remain optimistic. Cellphone towers are up and the local energy provider has dispatched 250 trucks and 500 workers to replace every downed power line. It will take another two weeks until the entire town has power again, Cathey said. The water is not drinkable, but it is now running through the faucets and can be used for showering and cooking.\n\nNo one has yet to do an estimate of damage, Cathey said, and no one has any practical idea of what redevelopment plans might look like.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to see how new building codes affect construction,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are still a lot of blanks we need to fill.\u201d\n\nThose sentiments seemed familiar to John Kelly, the city administrator in Gulfport, Miss., a city of 70,000 that was decimated by Katrina. Back then, Kelly said, the city received more than $250 million from FEMA to rebuild sewer lines, restore power grids and repave roads. Repairing infrastructure took more than a year, Kelly said, but the improvements then lured businesses that built new casinos, local restaurants and then reimagined downtown as a vibrant tourist attraction.\n\nAlong the way, Kelly said, the city invited residents to a workshop to give input about the future of the city, which helped boost morale.\n\n\u201cIt was more therapeutic than anything else,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cBut when you\u2019ve been hit by something like a natural disaster, you need something to hold on to \u2014 to make you feel like you can help.\u201d\n\nCathey felt his city didn\u2019t need workshops to determine its future. Everyone wanted the place to hark back to its past.\n\n\u201cThe founding families used to say we are strong of mind, strong of back and strong of heart,\u201d Cathey said while he stood outside his hardware store, now a jumble of wood and wires. \u201cWe aren\u2019t trying to make a show and be something we aren\u2019t. Families here didn\u2019t need a Ferris wheel or bumper cars, or the hustle-bustle. We\u2019re old Florida here.\u201d\n\nHe paused.\n\n\u201cBut there is going to be a significant visual change for the place,\u201d Cathey continued. \u201cThose old beach cottage homes that have been passed down for generations? They\u2019re gone.\u201d\n\nMinutes later, a gray-haired woman driving past the hardware store slammed her brakes. She was trembling when she stepped outside her car. She walked toward Cathey, tears streaming down her cheeks.\n\n\u201cI had to stop and hug the mayor,\u201d she said. She grabbed him by the arms.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going away for a while, but I\u2019m coming back,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you hear me? I\u2019m not giving up.\u201d\n\nNow, it was the mayor whose eyes were tearing up.\n\n\u201cI know there are more like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe loved what we had.\u201d\n\nFrost felt that way, too, but she had to be realistic. She needed to make money.\n\nThe business was starting to boom this year, she said, and then her husband, Jay, developed a heart aneurysm. By August, he was gone. Then came Michael, and their business was gone. Their house was, too.\n\nShe found an old empty building in the town of Eastpointwith an apartment above it that was up for sale. So she planned to use the money from her husband\u2019s death to buy the building, purchase a new cash register and begin moving the pots from the sand. She\u2019d start a new shop in a different town.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost a lot in the past year and it\u2019s still happening,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve come to peace with what I need to do.\u201d\n\nShe hoped to open a second shop in Mexico Beach when the time is right. She couldn\u2019t will it, but she still hoped, one day, that the town would come back. And when it does, she\u2019d be back, too.\n\n'Forgotten forever'\n\nThis is the Mexico Beach that Chris Maday knew: He ate breakfast at Sharon\u2019s Caf\u00e9 and dined at Mango Marley\u2019s. He was excited about the new auto shop that opened a year ago by a man who also fell in love with the same laid-back, no frills community he did.\n\nWhen Maday\u2019s children were growing up, he relished taking them to get snow cones at Tommy T\u2019s and walking with them along the pier. It was a quiet, serene place.\n\nNow trucks and excavators were picking up piles of debris, wood, brick and rubble. Police sirens blinked and blared, and spray paint was scrawled on homes the color of Easter eggs. Signs for free water and hot meals abounded.\n\nCars constantly passed by with their windows down while passengers recorded video on their phones, mouths agape. For a city that didn\u2019t want any tourist attractions, it had become one.\n\nSharon\u2019s and Mango Marley\u2019s were now boarded-up shells. Tommy T\u2019s collapsed and the pier\u2019s wooden planks had blown away.\n\nMaday said he thought the town could restore its original identity if he helped old businesses. So he tried to help Frost find her old stuff. He was searching through the rubble one day when a woman yelled, \u201cWe found two of her pots down there! Do you want them?\u201d\n\nThe woman\u2019s name was Jane Hughes. The wave that washed away the pottery shop had also washed over the roof of her family vacation home. The water cascaded inside, pushing out the insulation and destroying everything within.\n\n\u201cOur home is gone, so we are just trying to help people,\u201d she told Maday. She gripped a faded 8-by-10 photo in her right hand, on which she had a wrist tattoo that said, \u201cendure.\u201d\n\nHughes hoped her family could endure. Her father had inherited their house across the street 11 months ago from his father. His father bought it from her great-aunt, who built the house in the 1950s.\n\n\u201cEven after insurance, the place will probably be more than we can afford after bringing it up to code,\u201d her husband, Marcus Hughes, said begrudgingly. Logically, they all agreed, it would make more sense to sell the house than to try to keep it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Jane Hughes said. \u201cIf a developer tried to buy that house, my father would probably try to shoot him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t know how many people are going to feel that way,\u201d Maday said. \u201cThe older people can\u2019t rebuild; it\u2019s too late in their lives. Who is going to be left? Who is going to care? The trucks will be gone, and all that will be left is us. We are just the flavor of the week. Then, we will be forgotten forever.\u201d", "\n\nDan Crenshaw, a former Navy SEAL, was elected to Congress from the Houston area after running for office for the first time. \u201cHe\u2019s just tenacious,\u201d said his predecessor, retiring Rep. Ted Poe (R). (Dan Zak; Ross May/The Washington Post; iStock)\n\nDan Crenshaw\u2019s good eye is good enough, but it\u2019s not great. The iris is broken. The retina is scarred. He needs a special oversized contact lens, and bifocals sometimes, to correct his vision. Six years after getting blown up, he can still see a bit of debris floating in his cornea. His bad eye? Well, his bad eye is gone. Under his eye patch is a false eye that is deep blue. At the center of it, where a pupil should be, is the gold trident symbol of the Navy SEALs. It makes Dan Crenshaw look like a Guardian of the Galaxy.\n\nBut he can\u2019t catch a baseball very well anymore. He misses plenty of handshakes; his arm shortchanges the reach, his palm fumbles the grip. He has trouble with dumb little tasks \u2014 he needs to touch a pitcher to a cup to properly pour a glass of water, for example. But nothing major. Nothing that would prevent him from coming out of nowhere, unknown and underfunded, to vanquish seven opponents in a Republican primary, then squash a state legislator in a runoff, and then on Tuesday, at age 34, win his first-ever general election to represent his native Houston area in Congress.\n\nHe\u2019ll join a freshman class with two dozen other newly elected House members who are under 40 and, at least, 15 who are veterans. Yet, Crenshaw seems poised to stand out. His potent life story, his striking presence and his military and Ivy League credentials have set him up as a rising star for a Republican Party in bad need of one, after losing what could turn out to be three dozen seats once the dust settles.\n\nThirty-six hours after his election-night triumph, Crenshaw still hadn\u2019t caught up on sleep. There was some stale cake sitting in his campaign office, and he was juggling phone calls and a haircut he was going to be late for. He just left a luncheon with business leaders and was due early the next morning for a veterans ceremony. In two days, he would make a surprise appearance on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d before heading to Capitol Hill for a two-week orientation.\n\nA whirlwind to everyone else, it seemed, but not him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s life,\u201d Crenshaw said, sitting at a conference table in his Houston office last week. \u201cIt\u2019s not a challenge.\u201d He was the picture of calm. The eye patch was off. The gold trident sparkled. Behind him was a large framed photo of Ronald Reagan. Ahead of him was the next mission.\n\nWeirdly, his election wasn't the biggest news in Crenshaw's life last week. That came during the first minutes of Nov. 4 on the \"Weekend Update\" portion of \"Saturday Night Live,\" when cast member Pete Davidson, who gave a riff on the midterms, presented a photo of Crenshaw, eye patch on.\n\n\u201cYou may be surprised to hear he\u2019s a congressional candidate from Texas and not a hit-man in a porno movie,\u201d the comedian joked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know he lost his eye in war or whatever.\u201d\n\n[SNL\u2019s Pete Davidson hasn\u2019t apologized for mocking a GOP candidate who lost an eye in war]\n\nThe studio audience laughed, but everyone else took to their soapboxes. How dare liberal jokesters malign an American hero! How dare conservatives put constraints on comedy! A wave of national media came his way and Crenshaw, appearing on CNN and Fox News, was cool as a cucumber. He wasn\u2019t offended. He was just disappointed that the joke was lame and unfunny.\n\nThen, Crenshaw said, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d creator Lorne Michaels called to apologize and to invite him on this weekend\u2019s show. Crenshaw hesitated. He\u2019s not an entertainer. He had Veterans Day events over the weekend, but he saw a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to share a clear message with a national audience.\n\nAfter roasting Davidson in classic SNL fashion (\u201cThis is Pete Davidson. He looks like if the meth from \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 was a person\u201d), Crenshaw took a moment.\n\n\u201cBut, seriously, there\u2019s a lot of lessons to learn here,\u201d Crenshaw said, addressing the camera as he sat next to Davidson. \u201cNot just that the left and right can still agree on some things but also this: Americans can forgive one another. We can remember what brings us together as a country.\u201d He encouraged Americans to connect with veterans by telling them, \u201cNever forget,\u201d instead of, \u201cThanks for your service.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you say \u2018never forget\u2019 to a veteran, you are implying that, as an American, you are in it with them . . . and never forget those we lost on 9/11 \u2014 heroes like Pete\u2019s father,\u201d a firefighter who died in the World Trade Center. \u201cSo I\u2019ll just say, Pete, never forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever forget,\u201d Davidson replied.\n\n\n\nCrenshaw gives an interview to a TV reporter in Houston two days after his election night victory. (Dan Zak/The Washington Post)\n\nCrenshaw \u2014 shown with his wife, Tara, at his primary victory \u2014 lost an eye in Afghanistan. His eye patch became a symbol of his campaign. (Mark Mulligan/Houston Chronicle via AP)\n\nCrenshaw's father's career in the oil and gas industry took the family to Ecuador and Colombia, where Crenshaw went to high school and learned Spanish. Captivated as a child by the SEAL memoir \"Rogue Warrior,\" he was commissioned as a naval officer in 2006 and underwent SEAL training, fracturing his tibia during its infamous \"hell week\" but completing the challenge on his second go-round. He deployed twice to Iraq and then, in 2012, to Afghanistan.\n\nOn June 15, 2012, when Crenshaw was 28, he and his platoon helicoptered into Helmand province on a last-minute mission to support a Marine Special Operations unit. At the time, Helmand was littered with improvised explosive devices. Bombs were so present in some areas that it was safer to crouch in place during oncoming fire \u2014 and wager on a sniper\u2019s uncertain aim \u2014 than to dive for cover onto uncertain ground.\n\nWhile Crenshaw\u2019s platoon moved to secure a compound, an Afghan interpreter named Raqman, who wanted to become a Navy SEAL himself, responded to a call and crossed in front of Crenshaw. Raqman stepped on a pressure plate, triggering 15 pounds of explosives and suffering fatal injuries. Crenshaw, who was a couple of paces back, said he felt like he was hit by a truck while a firing squad shot at him. He was on the ground and his eyes were numb. The rest of his body screamed like it had been scratched open and doused in Tabasco. He reached down and felt his legs. Good sign. He had no vision, but assumed his eyes were just filled with dirt.\n\nA medic friend began assessing the damage.\n\n\u201cDude, don\u2019t ever get blown up,\u201d Crenshaw said to him. \u201cIt really sucks.\u201d\n\n[From a cheerful Texas stadium to an anxious Boston party, here\u2019s what the 2020 starting line felt like.]\n\nHe refused to be carried on a stretcher, because he didn\u2019t want to expose comrades to enemy fire for no good reason. He walked to a medical evacuation, where he was put into a coma. He woke up in Germany a few days later, blind and swollen. The remains of his right eye had been surgically removed; eventually a copper wire would be pulled out of his left. Doctors said there was a chance he might see again, but, for Crenshaw, it was a certainty. Seeing again became his mission, and that sense of mission helped him endure the hallucinations, the surgeries, the weeks he had to spend \u2014 face down and sightless \u2014 while his eye healed, and the two years it took for a medical bureaucracy to get him to a place of relative comfort. He remembered how his mother, who died of cancer when he was 10, never complained during her five-year struggle with the illness. He held fast to his sense that life is about mission: You need one to live and to live productively.\n\nJust over a year after his injury, he married his longtime girlfriend, Tara.\n\nHe deployed twice more, to Bahrain and South Korea, as troop commander of an intelligence team.\n\nIn various commendations, the Navy cited him for his \u201czealous initiative,\u201d \u201cwise judgment\u201d and \u201cunswerving determination.\u201d Medically retired in 2016, Crenshaw then earned a master\u2019s degree in public administration from the Harvard Kennedy School.\n\nIn 2017, he returned to Houston \u2014 for the first significant chunk of time since he was a child \u2014 to help with recovery after Hurricane Harvey.\n\nWhile Crenshaw was looking for a policy job on Capitol Hill, an adviser to Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) took one look at him and, before they even sat down to talk, told him to run for office. The day before, Rep. Ted Poe (R) had announced his retirement from Texas\u2019s second district, which starts in Houston and curves around the city like a tadpole. It was kismet.\n\n\u201cHe said he wanted to run for office one day, but wanted to get policy experience first,\u201d said a Capitol Hill aide who ended up advising the campaign (and requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly). \u201cI was like, \u2018Have you paid attention to some of the people we have up here? You don\u2019t need that.\u2019 . . . And he went all in. It\u2019s the SEAL ethos. It was amazing to watch.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s life. It\u2019s not a challenge,\u201d says Crenshaw of the whirlwind week that ended with him getting elected to Congress and guest starring on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d (Dan Zak/The Washington Post)\n\nThe campaign started in November 2017, four months before the Republican primary.\n\n\u201cI had never heard of him before he arrived. I would venture to say most people had never heard of him,\u201d said Vlad Davidiuk, communications director for the Harris County Republican Party. \u201cThe district has changed demographically, and is no longer as solid red as it used to be. It required a candidate who was willing to campaign hard . . . What distinguished Dan Crenshaw most is his ability to engage with voters.\u201d\n\nOver five days in February, Crenshaw laced up his sneakers and ran 100 miles through the district, campaigning along the way. Thanks to a surge in day-of voting for the crowded primary, he sneaked into second place by 155 votes, besting an opponent who had spent millions of her personal fortune. By then, his personal story was resonating. His face was recognizable and symbolic.\n\nMost Texas Republicans aren\u2019t very exciting, said Mark P. Jones, a political-science professor at Rice University in Crenshaw\u2019s district. \u201cNone of them are very compelling or appealing. They\u2019re just sort of random old white dudes, and Dan Crenshaw was something new and different.\u201d\n\n[The battle in your ear buds: The bros of political podcasting and their quest to reinvent punditry]\n\nHe had schooled himself on border security, health care and flood-control issues \u2014 a big concern for a region still smarting from Harvey. He met with engineers to discuss infrastructure and with young Republicans to energize new voters. More than one yard in the district was adorned with both a Crenshaw sign and a \u201cBETO\u201d sign, in allegiance to Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Democrat challenging Sen. Ted Cruz (whom Crenshaw outperformed by 12 percentage points in Harris County).\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just tenacious,\u201d Poe said of the man who will be his successor. \u201cI don\u2019t think folks are going to know what to do when he gets [to Washington], and I mean that in a good way.\u201d\n\nIn a 2015 Facebook post flagged by one of his opponents, Crenshaw called candidate Donald Trump an idiot and referred to his rhetoric on Muslims as \u201cinsane,\u201d according to the Texas Tribune. Three years later, Crenshaw says he supports the president\u2019s policies, save for the trade warfare, but prefers to comport himself in a manner that is the total opposite of the commander in chief\u2019s.\n\n\u201cHis style is not my style,\u201d Crenshaw says. \u201cI\u2019ll just say that. It\u2019s never how I would conduct myself. But what readers of The Washington Post need to understand is that conservatives can hold multiple ideas in their head at the same time. We can be like, \u2018Wow he shouldn\u2019t have tweeted that\u2019 and still support him . . . You can disapprove of what the president says every day, or that day, and still support his broader agenda.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, he was the only true bright spot for the GOP in Harris County, where O\u2019Rourke\u2019s candidacy brought Democrats to the polls and flushed out Republicans down the ballot. Crenshaw won 53 percent of the vote, but reached out to the other 47 percent during his victory speech in downtown Houston.\n\n\u201cThis life, this purpose, this American spirit that we hold dear \u2014 we are not alone,\u201d he said, sharing the mission: \u201cWe do it together.\u201d\n\nStaff reporter Dan Lamothe contributed to this report.", "\n\nFox News Channel\u2019s Bret Baier says: \u201cI don\u2019t spend a lot of time analyzing what the opinion shows are doing.\u201d (Kristoffer Tripplaar/For The Washington Post)\n\nOn election night at Fox News Channel, big red news alerts lit up the small courtyard outside Studio F where Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum were hosting the channel\u2019s midterms coverage.\n\nThe rain had just let up and Baier, the channel\u2019s chief political anchor, sat square-jawed and sober, resembling a Dick Tracy cartoon without the hat. MacCallum, a new presence as an election-night co-anchor (for the 2016 presidential election, Megyn Kelly was in that seat) appeared sharp in a suffragist-appropriate white jumpsuit with perfectly arranged blond hair.\n\nThis was supposed to be Fox News\u2019s star turn \u2014 the big day for its journalists. Instead, the previous 24 hours had exposed the spreading fissures at Fox News, which is in the midst of its own version of a civil war, pitting its news anchors against its big-name pundits, who are avid promoters of President Trump. Baier, who has been at Fox for 21 years, says he approaches every day \u201cwith horse blinders on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t spend a lot of time analyzing what the opinion shows are doing,\u201d he adds, but it was impossible to ignore Sean Hannity\u2019s guest appearance at President Trump\u2019s final midterm-elections rally in Missouri.\n\nBefore the rally, Hannity had said he would only be interviewing Trump and wouldn\u2019t appear on stage. But after the interview, Hannity did exactly what he said he was not going to do, which was jump onstage, hug Trump, repeat his campaign talking points, and then high-five former Fox News executive Bill Shine, who is now the White House deputy chief of staff in charge of communications.\n\nHannity later said Trump\u2019s invitation to join him on stage was unexpected, which many at the channel disbelieved. \u201cYou know he\u2019s lying through his teeth, right?\u201d said one current Fox News staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly. Hannity maintained on his show after election night that \u201che had no idea\u201d that the president was going to invite him up there.\n\nHannity\u2019s decision to bound up on stage effectively made him a part of the Trump campaign and further wed the channel and the president. And, like any married couple, Fox News and the White House have started to resemble one another. The West Wing contains various factions; so does Fox. Baier and MacCallum are like Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, projecting a reasonable mien and moderate opinions, while Hannity and others lean toward the extremes.\n\nThe day before the midterm elections, Rupert Murdoch, whose family controls the company that owns Fox News, stopped by Baier and MacCallum\u2019s practice session. \u201cRupert is at heart a newsman, and he likes to know what is going on,\u201d Baier said in an interview.\n\nThe Murdoch family has its factions, too. Hollywood spotlights circled outside and occasionally highlighted the office tower from which Murdoch and his son, Lachlan, watched the channel\u2019s coverage with a small gathering of senior staff. James Murdoch, who has told friends he is embarrassed by much of what appears on Fox News, did not attend.\n\nAs the network prepares for the 2020 presidential campaign the question is: Will Fox survive as a house united?\n\n\n\nSean Hannity of Fox News speaks at a campaign rally on the eve of the midterm elections. (Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nBaier and his news colleagues have long been overshadowed by the opinion hosts at Fox News, who have most often gotten the prime-time slots and biggest ratings. Hannity's ascent to star of the most-watched show on cable news came only after the departure of Bill O'Reilly (because of a sexual harassment scandal) and Megyn Kelly, who left Fox in early 2017 for a short-lived morning show on NBC News. Perhaps not coincidentally, Hannity's ascent occurred during the first year of Donald Trump's presidency.\n\nHannity\u2019s show \u201cHannity\u201d averaged over 3.5 million viewers in October, with Baier\u2019s show, \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d clocking an average of 2.7 million viewers, and MacCallum\u2019s \u201cThe Story with Martha MacCallum\u201d averaging 2.5 million, according to Nielsen Media Research.\n\nElection-night coverage was seen as an important moment for Baier and MacCallum to showcase their straightforward style and set them and their news colleagues apart from the image of Fox News that is so tied to Donald Trump and decried by critics as state TV.\n\nFor election night 2018, Fox News built an outdoor studio plus three large screens that broadcast the coverage from the main anchor desks inside. The last element of the Fox Election Experience was a promotional tent for Fox Nation, the streaming service that Fox News plans to launch late this month for its self-proclaimed \u201csuperfans.\u201d A sign welcomed visitors: \u201cFeeling Left Out? Join Fox Nation.\u201d\n\nFox News alerts about the win by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) garnered boos from the crowd in the courtyard, as did Florida gubernatorial hopeful Andrew Gillum\u2019s early lead. When Republican Ron DeSantis pulled ahead later, the crowd whooped. When a photo of Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) appeared on the large screen outside Studio F, a man draped in a U.S. flag yelled \u201cAnti-American!\u201d\n\nInside the main studio, Baier and MacCallum played it straight. They left it to Laura Ingraham, who has mocked Parkland survivor David Hogg and compared immigrant detention facilities to \u201csummer camp,\u201d to argue that Trump deserved more credit for helping Republicans maintain control of the Senate.\n\nThere were moments in the evening when it felt as if Ingraham might have been more comfortable cheering outside, alongside Aimee Cabo and her husband. They were visiting from Miami. Cabo enthused about Trump rallies: \u201cI love watching them,\u201d she said. Cabo added that she also loved parts but not all of Fox News.\n\n\u201cI love \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 and anything after 5 p.m.,\u201d Cabo said. \u201cAnything in between, they are more Democrat than Republican.\u201d\n\nThe divide inside Fox had been on display in the weeks leading up to the midterm elections. Parroting Trump\u2019s hyped-up rhetoric of a dangerous and imminent migrant \u201cinvasion,\u201d Jeanine Pirro, Brian Kilmeade and other Fox contributors imagined the migrants wandering through Mexico as a group preparing to charge the border and bringing diseases, wife beaters and maybe even pedophiles to the United States.\n\nIt fell to Shepard Smith, Fox\u2019s chief news anchor, to level with viewers at the end of October that the migrants, if they arrived at the U.S. border at all, were two months away. \u201cThere is no invasion. No one is coming to get you,\u201d he soberly told the camera. \u201cThere is nothing at all to worry about.\u201d\n\n\n\nBrett M.

(Jeffrey McWhorter/Associated Press)\n\nIt's hard to know how Ailes, who was ousted in 2016 in a sexual harassment scandal and who died in 2017, would have handled Trump and Hannity's bond. When he was alive, Ailes gave Trump a platform as a birther conspiracy theorist on \"Fox & Friends\" but didn't like Trump as a political candidate, former associates say. Ailes did not want a single individual in the GOP to dictate Fox News's coverage; he wanted to run the GOP. Some former Fox News executives see the network's alignment with Trump, as well as its inability to control Hannity, as a sign of how Ailes managed to keep major stars in line.\n\n\u201cWhen I left Fox, nobody inside there liked Trump,\u201d said Eric Bolling, former co-host of the Fox News show \u201cThe Five.\u201d \u201cNow, look at it. Everyone is falling into line.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump declared his candidacy, divisions inside the network played out on camera. Dana Perino, a former press secretary for George W. Bush, was dubbed one of the \u201cBushies,\u201d and Greg Gutfeld, another co-host of \u201cThe Five,\u201d regularly attacked Trump on air. Other Fox personalities, including Bolling himself, Kimberly Guilfoyle and Hannity were pro-Trump from the start.\n\nBolling and Guilfoyle have left the network. (Guilfoyle is dating the president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr.) Today, both Perino, who has been given her own 2 p.m. news show, and Gutfeld are quieter in their objections.\n\nThe pro-Trump posture of Fox News alienated some contributors. Ralph Peters, a longtime military analyst for the channel, severed his association with Fox months ago and said in an interview that the network divides itself into three categories: the true believers who see Trump as \u201cthe new messiah;\u201d the cable news opportunists, who have fallen into line; and the respectable hosts who are \u201cdisgusted by what goes on there.\u201d But the distinction between opinion and programming hosts is meaningless these days, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s like saying, \u2018I\u2019m only a prostitute from noon to midnight.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBaier hardly appears disgusted \u2014 \u201cFox News is a great place to work,\u201d he says \u2014 but finds himself in a news environment dominated by the president and the conspiracy theories sometimes created by his colleagues. He tries to keep his show at least partly away from Trump news. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of our problems as an industry overall. President Trump is brilliant at that. He controls the media, and he\u2019s in the conversation, and he\u2019s on the front page every day.\u201d\n\nThe New Yorker\u2019s Ken Auletta noted recently in a conversation at Advertising Week New York that Baier\u2019s show is more expansive than the average. \u201c I get more news about the Middle East on Bret Baier at six o\u2019clock than I do at CNN.\u201d\n\n\n\nShepard Smith, Fox\u2019s chief news anchor, leveled with viewers about President Trump\u2019s talk of a migrant \u201cinvasion.\u201d The migrants, if they arrived at the U.S. border at all, were two months away. \u201cThere is no invasion. No one is coming to get you,\u201d he soberly told the camera. (Richard Drew/Associated Press)\n\nAfter Hannity's onstage appearance with Trump, Baier said that \"there was a lot of reaction inside the company,\" and that he, MacCallum, Brit Hume and Chris Wallace addressed it at a pre-scheduled lunch with Fox News chief executive Suzanne Scott and Fox News President Jay Wallace the day of the election.\n\n\u201cIt was a big part of the discussion,\u201d Baier said. Wallace and Scott told them the Murdochs had been personally involved in the statement that Fox News put out that morning expressing disapproval of Hannity\u2019s action. \u201cWe felt confident that they understood the seriousness of the moment, and that the news side needed to make sure [management] had our backs. . . . I do something different than Sean does, but when an event like this happens, it needs to be clear cut.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Baier had what he called \u201ca good conversation\u201d with Hannity. The two men have been with Fox News from the beginning and have known one another for 21 years. Still, the whole thing was \u201ca huge distraction from what was a huge night.\u201d\n\nThe whole thing didn\u2019t hurt ratings. As it has been for years, Fox News was the highest-rated news program on election night, beating both cable and network news programs with 7.8 million prime-time viewers, according to Nielsen.\n\nAs for Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, they were \u201cdisappointed and felt strongly about reassuring the journalists at Fox News\u201d that what Hannity did \u201cis not acceptable,\u201d according to a person close to them. Disappointed or not, the Murdochs and Fox News are at the mercy of Trump and Hannity, at least for now. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to support Sean in the short term but Sean\u2019s key to survival now is the connection to the Trump base and voter,\u201d said a Trump administration official close to the network. Lachlan Murdoch recently said that he wasn\u2019t embarrassed by what is on Fox News and that more people watch the channel\u2019s news coverage than its opinion programming.\n\nHannity has flirted with other political figures. He was due to appear at a 2010 Cincinnati fundraiser for the tea party when Ailes angrily called him home before he could participate. This time, with the Missouri rally, there was no one to call him back before it was too late. \u201cHannity is really pushing the envelope,\u201d said a former Fox executive. \u201cHe\u2019s daring people to try to stop him.\u201d", "\n\nBlue skies and a blustery wind yesterday at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in the District.(Angela N./Flickr) (angela n.)\n\nTODAY\u2019S DAILY DIGIT\n\n6/10: Still sunny and cool, at least we lose the wind.

The memorial commemorates more than 72,000 men of British and South African forces who died in the Somme Offensive of 1916. (Eliot Blondet/Pool photo via AP)\n\nThe First World War ended 100 years ago today. Scholars have long debated its causes and effects. Yet surprisingly few have explored why the war lasted four long and bloody years. Could it have ended sooner?\n\nIn fact, largely forgotten is how Germany and the United States issued peace overtures in December 1916. Had these overtures been successful, they could have spared countless lives and have helped Europe escape the financial ruin and deep-seated animosity that produced World War II. Unfortunately, the Entente \u2014 Britain, France and Russia \u2014 dismissed both offers, and the fighting continued. In our Security Studies article, we show that honor influenced their decision to forgo peace.\n\nHonor vs. rationality\n\nSociologists argue that honor is crucial to group self-esteem, involving an emotional investment in how groups define themselves and their place in social hierarchies. Honor leads actors to believe that others must respect these identities. It can enhance cooperation when mutual respect exists, but encourage severe escalation and undercut conflict resolution when it does not.\n\n[There\u2019s another way to build peace. And it doesn\u2019t come from the top down.]\n\nAccordingly, when identity faces an external threat, actors feel an intense psychological need to salvage their honor. To restore besmirched honor, either the transgressor apologizes or the victim punishes. The longer the transgressor refuses to apologize and resists punishment, the more the victim will dig in and perhaps even risk dying for honor\u2019s sake.\n\nThreats to honor can thus undermine rational behavior and make wars longer. Rationality means that an actor objectively assesses available information, selects which goals it will pursue and picks the most efficient and risk averse way to do so. However, when honor is at stake, leaders might begin to ignore disconfirming evidence, prioritize honor over survival and adopt strategies based on hope, not efficiency.\n\nHow did honor preclude peace in 1916?\n\nIn 1916, both sides suffered catastrophic losses and devastating setbacks. Victory remained elusive. The Western Front was deadlocked. Though Russia achieved modest progress on the Eastern Front, a German counteroffensive quickly erased its gains. The Entente was losing soldiers faster than it could replace them.\n\nFinancially, the Entente was almost insolvent. Britain\u2019s leadership role in global finance was in jeopardy, and its expenditures exceeded revenue by a factor of three. For France, the ratio was about five to one.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Germany dispatched peace notes to the Entente on Dec. 12, 1916. Several days later, President Wilson issued a separate offer to mediate an end to the conflict. Considering the hurting stalemate that then defined the war, rejecting the offers out of hand had no rational basis. Arranging secret talks with Germany would have been simple, bearing little risk. The Entente could have easily resumed combat operations if talks collapsed.\n\n[What World War I can tell us about international commerce and war today]\n\nHonor pushed the Entente to prefer war over peace despite the overwhelming costs and risks. In his Aug. 3, 1914, address to the British Parliament, Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey invoked \u201chonour\u201d seven times. He stated: \u201cIf, in a crisis like this, we run away \u2026 from those obligations of honour and interest as regards the Belgian treaty, I doubt whether, whatever material force we might have at the end, it would be of very much value in face of the respect that we should have lost.\u201d\n\nHonor was worth the material price, no matter how high. Germany was unapologetic about its transgressions. Atrocities in Belgium and repeated frustrations on the battlefield to win and exact punishment made national honor take priority over national survival. War aims expanded; by December 1916, the Entente came to believe the only way to overcome dishonor was to destroy the German regime itself.\n\nThe historical record shows Entente leaders were clouded in their judgments of objective facts and rational alternatives. The diplomatic cables and British cabinet minutes that we discovered reveal their logical contradictions, emotionality and irrational decision-making.\n\nBritish leaders cherry-picked pieces of good news from the overwhelmingly negative battlefield reports they received. The chief of the Imperial General Staff wrote that Britain should not \u201cflinch\u201d and warned how \u201cwe need the same courage in London as our leaders in the North Sea and France.\u201d\n\nBritish leaders were outraged by the German offer\u2019s \u201chaughty rhetoric.\u201d They failed to consider that Germany likely used boastful wording to offset the weakness that offering peace signaled. They denounced the overture as a \u201cduplicitous war ruse,\u201d and decried it for lacking specificity. Yet, they breathlessly added that the terms were unacceptable.\n\n[How World War I could have ended a whole year earlier]\n\nEntente leaders did not reject the offers because they expected Washington to enter the war, as Anglo-American relations were worsening. Wilson won reelection on an isolationist platform; Congress was decidedly anti-British. The Federal Reserve Board discouraged U.S. banks from loaning money to the Entente. Far from anticipating American intervention, the Entente feared the United States would use its financial power to force both sides to negotiate.\n\nHonor closed the door on peace in 1916 and set the stage for a brute force fight to the finish. As work by Scott Wolford suggests, German leaders soon became convinced anything short of total victory meant total defeat. Instead of seeking peace after knocking Russia out of the war in 1917, Germany \u201cgambled for resurrection\u201d by launching a massive offensive on the Western Front in early 1918.\n\nOur explanation makes sense of Germany\u2019s seemingly self-defeating decisions. Germany was sincere when it offered peace in 1916. Why otherwise risk looking weak by offering to negotiate? The speed and finality with which the Entente rejected the overture convinced German leaders that the Entente was now fully committed to regime change. The episode convinced German leaders that they were in an existential fight for survival.\n\nThe autumn of 1916 offers a sober lesson for today. Leaders may have trouble acting rationally when they believe their nation\u2019s honor is at stake. Far from a relic of a bygone era in international relations, honor can still intensify violence and undermine peaceful resolution \u2014 a frightening prospect in a world with nuclear weapons. From saber rattling in the Baltic States to brinkmanship in the South China Sea, we have good reasons not to let honor subvert global peace and stability 100 years on.\n\nAlexander Lanoszka (@ALanoszka) is an assistant professor in the department of political science at the University of Waterloo and an honorary fellow at City, University of London.\n\nMichael A.

He had thought the welding work would take him through retirement. (Chico Harlan/TWP)\n\nFor the thousands in this economically battered town who can\u2019t find work, the local state-run employment center advertised one day last week just a single job: for a part-time social worker who could fill in during somebody\u2019s six-month maternity leave.\n\nRecently, though, people have started walking into the center asking about something else \u2014 the welfare benefits, aimed at struggling and jobless Italians, planned by the country\u2019s populist government.\n\nThe center\u2019s director, Enrico Caricaterra, said staffers field questions about the policy almost every day. When will it start? How can one apply? And will it make a difference?\n\n\u201cIf people are desperate, they will look for anything,\u201d Caricaterra said.\n\nThose planned benefits are a core component of Italy\u2019s controversial proposal to salve, and maybe jump-start, one of the world\u2019s most troubled developed economies. The plan is an anti-austerity clarion call, and it has sparked a confrontation with the European Union.\n\nOfficials in Brussels say Italy is trying to defy European fiscal rules and recklessly spend money it doesn\u2019t have. The E.U. cannot veto Italy\u2019s plans, but in recent weeks Europe\u2019s executive branch has applied as much pressure as it can, asking Italy to reconsider its spending at the risk of unprecedented financial sanctions.\n\n\n\nFive Star Movement supporters rally in Rome. (Antonio Masiello/Getty Images)\n\nPopulist leaders in Rome counter that the norms of Europe haven\u2019t worked for the euro zone\u2019s third-largest economy \u2014 and that now is the time to upend them.\n\nItaly\u2019s new budget defies E.U. guidelines calling for heavily indebted countries to reduce their burden. The plan, which would pay for welfare programs, tax cuts and pension reforms, targets a budget deficit that is 2.4 percent of gross domestic product. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said that the needs of Italians, \u201cfor once,\u201d will come first.\n\nIn the current political climate, Italian leaders stand to gain by adopting an anti-E.U. stance. But Italy\u2019s populists are responding to one of the underlying forces that helped sweep them into power: potent frustration about an economy that has all but forgotten how to grow.\n\n[E.U. Commission rejects Italy\u2019s budget]\n\nWhile other once-troubled economies across the continent have rebounded , Italy\u2019s economy remains smaller than it was at the turn of the century \u2014 a result, analysts say, of an aging population, some onerous regulations and low productivity, among other factors. The country has the euro zone\u2019s third-highest unemployment rate, and legions of young people flee for jobs elsewhere in Europe and beyond. During the past 10 years, according to government data, the number of Italians living in absolute poverty has nearly tripled.\n\nThe new spending measures have proved popular with voters. But the plan comes with significant peril. Italy is among the world\u2019s most heavily indebted nations, analysts note. It is vowing to disregard a rule that was drawn up to prevent future European economic crises.\n\nMarkets have shown jitters. Bond yields have risen, though they haven\u2019t spiked to crisis levels. Some economists say Italy has increased the risk of a dangerous spiral \u2014 especially if the new spending doesn\u2019t stimulate growth.\n\nIn a worst-case scenario, investors would start to sell off Italian bonds at a greater clip, worried the loans might not be repaid. The bonds would lose value. Italy\u2019s interest rates would rise. Italy would be forced to pay more and more to service its debt, sending ripples through banks across Europe and prompting lending, and growth, to shrivel.\n\nIf Italy\u2019s debt becomes unsustainable, it\u2019s unclear what would happen next, including whether Europe could marshal the political will to bail out a defiant member of the bloc. Any bailout deal would be tied to Italy accepting reforms \u2014 the very austerity measures that its government is now trying to spurn.\n\nItaly has said it is committed to the common currency of the euro. The two parties that make up its government \u2014 the left-leaning Five Star Movement and the far-right League \u2014 have clashed over some aspects of running the country. But the parties\u2019 leaders, Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini, have spoken similarly about changing the nature of Europe from within and winning followers for their brands of populism.\n\nSalvini, of the League, recently said that two top E.U. authorities had \u201cruined Europe and our country.\u201d He said E.U. measures had \u201cmade Italy poor.\u201d\n\n\u201cSalvini and Di Maio want to remain part of the euro zone without respecting the rules; that is the inherent contradiction in the position they are articulating,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the Eurasia Group\u2019s managing director for Europe. \u201cThat is the contradiction at the heart of what the Italian government is doing today, and that is the fundamental problem for Europe.\u201d\n\nEurope has proved capable in the past of imposing its will on rebellious members, most notably Greece. The European Commission has asked Italy to resubmit a revised budget by Tuesday. In the meantime, its officials have said Italy is overestimating the growth that would stem from its spending.\n\nA chunk of that spending would fund the \u201ccitizens\u2019 income\u201d plan, a welfare proposal that helped the Five Star Movement capture widespread support across the country\u2019s poorer regions, particularly in the south, as its politicians railed against the inequities of capitalism. Since entering the government, Five Star has been overshadowed by Salvini\u2019s anti-migrant League, losing its place as the country\u2019s most popular party. Analysts say Five Star\u2019s credibility, and much of its political future, depends on following through on a central campaign pledge.\n\nFive Star officials say that Italy, at the moment, has an insufficient safety net and that many people in poverty don\u2019t qualify for several versions of existing unemployment relief. That includes Italy\u2019s growing number of part-time and temporary workers, and those taking off-the-books jobs. Di Maio\u2019s economic adviser, Pasquale Tridico, said that for those who are unemployed, the citizens\u2019 income would be tied to job-hunting and training requirements. The government is aiming to have it in place by April.\n\n\u201cThis is why it\u2019s the most important labor policy of the last 30 years,\u201d Tridico said. \u201cThe ambitious goals are reducing or erasing poverty, attacking inactivity and helping reintegration.\u201d\n\n[Italy\u2019s first black cabinet minister sued by populists she deemed \u2018racist\u2019]\n\nIt remains to be seen whether such a policy would alter Italy\u2019s labor market. In Civitavecchia, a town of 53,000 an hour\u2019s drive outside Rome, Mayor Antonio Cozzolino, a member of the Five Star Movement, said the new welfare system could provide a \u201cmodicum of serenity to those who have lost their jobs.\u201d\n\nSome, like Patrizio Papini, 48, have in fact lost their careers. Until five years ago, he was a welder who helped build massive luxury yachts. He figured the work would take him through retirement. But his company shuttered.\n\nSince then, Papini has been nothing and anything. He\u2019s cleaned the hulls of boats. He\u2019s cut grass. He\u2019s filled potholes. He\u2019s taken off-the-books jobs for wages he calls \u201chumiliating,\u201d as little as $17 per day. He and his family have moved into his mother-in-law\u2019s ground-floor apartment, and on days he can\u2019t find any work, Papini said he feels like \u201cdead weight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel despised,\u201d he said. \u201cAll eyes are trained on you like rifles, and I keep thinking, \u2018You haven\u2019t brought anything home today.\u2019 \u201d\n\nPapini has exhausted his unemployment benefits, but he said he\u2019s not excited by the planned welfare expansion; it\u2019s a handout, not a job. Of the three-dozen people with whom he once worked at the port, some have stayed in Civitavecchia and scrounged for the same temporary work as he has. Others have left for energy jobs in Russia or the Middle East.\n\nPapini, unwilling to leave his family, said he turned down a chance for employment in the United Arab Emirates. But he has started thinking more and more about what he\u2019ll tell his own children, who are between 6 and 14, as they near working age.\n\n\u201cI am going to tell them: Study and get out of Italy,\u201d he said.\n\nStefano Pitrelli contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nThe E.U. rejected Italy\u2019s budget.

International leaders are taking place in a ceremony in Paris on Sunday to mark the 100th anniversary of the Armistice that ended World War I. (Christophe Ena/Associated Press)\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 A fresh wave of fighting erupted between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip on Sunday, leaving seven Palestinians dead, including a local Hamas commander, just as Israel and the militant group had appeared to be making progress toward ratcheting down months of border violence.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what set off the sudden, late-night burst of violence.\n\nIn a statement, Hamas\u2019 armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, said Israeli undercover forces in a civilian vehicle infiltrated three kilometers (two miles) into Gaza and fatally shot the commander, Nour el-Deen Baraka. It said militants discovered the car and chased it down, prompting Israeli airstrikes that killed \u201ca number of people.\u201d The clashes cooled down early Monday.\n\nThe Israeli military reported an \u201cexchange of fire\u201d had taken place during operational activity in Gaza and said that \u201call IDF soldiers back in Israel.\u201d It did not elaborate.\n\nThe Palestinian Health Ministry said six people, including at least five militants, were killed and seven others wounded. In the early hours, a seventh body was found.\n\nIn Israel, the military said it had intercepted two rockets fired from Gaza as air raid sirens continued to sound.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on an official visit to France, announced he was rushing back to Israel to deal with the crisis.\n\nSunday\u2019s development shattered what appeared to be a turning point after months of bloodshed along the Israel-Gaza border, with weekly Hamas-led protests drawing thousands to the perimeter fence with Israel. Over 170 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the border protests, in which Palestinians throw rocks, burning tires and grenades toward Israeli troops.\n\nLast week, Israel allowed Qatar to deliver $15 million in aid to Gaza\u2019s cash-strapped Hamas rulers. Hamas responded by lowering the intensity of Friday\u2019s border protest.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Netanyahu had defended his decision to allow the transfer of the Qatari money, rejecting criticism that the move had strengthened the Islamic militant group.\n\nNetanyahu told reporters that it was \u201cthe right step\u201d at the moment and that he was committed to restoring quiet along the Israel-Gaza frontier and preventing a humanitarian crisis in the coastal Palestinian territory.\n\n\u201cEvery action, without exception, has a price,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t handle the price you cannot lead. And I can handle the price.\u201d\n\nIsraeli critics, including members of Netanyahu\u2019s hard-line coalition, accused him of capitulating to violence and of granting relief to the embattled Hamas group.\n\nThe internationally backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose forces lost control of Gaza to Hamas in 2007, angrily accused the U.S. and Israel of being involved in a \u201cconspiracy\u201d to permanently sever Gaza from the West Bank. He promised to take unspecified measures against his Hamas rivals in the coming days.\n\nHamas leaders in Gaza have described the arrival of the $15 million, delivered last week in three suitcases by a Qatari diplomat, as their first major gain of more than seven months of weekly protests along the perimeter fence.\n\nHamas has been leading the protests since March 30 in a bid to ease a crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade that was imposed in 2007 in order to weaken the militant group. The blockade has led to over 50 percent unemployment and chronic power outages, and prevents most Gazans from being able to leave the tiny territory.\n\nIsrael says it is defending its border against militant infiltrations, but its army has come under international criticism because of the large number of unarmed protesters who have been shot.\n\nWith Hamas threatening to intensify the protests and international officials warning of a looming humanitarian crisis, Netanyahu on Thursday allowed the cash into Gaza. It is the first installment of $90 million that Qatar has pledged to cover the salaries of thousands of unpaid Hamas employees for six months.\n\nIsraeli opposition figures lambasted Netanyahu for appearing to cave in to violence. Army Radio played decade-old sound clips of Netanyahu, from when he was the opposition leader, threatening tough action against Hamas and criticizing his predecessor for being too soft.\n\nEven his erstwhile allies attacked him for indirectly doing business with a militant group that has fought three wars against Israel and is sworn to Israel\u2019s destruction.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows where that money is going to go ultimately,\u201d said Netanyahu\u2019s agriculture minister, Uri Ariel.\n\nBut in comments to reporters before traveling to Paris, Netanyahu said it was a \u201cquestion of alternatives.\u201d He said the step was coordinated with security officials to restore quiet for Israeli citizens living near the Gaza border and to avert a humanitarian crisis.\n\nLater, at a press conference in Paris, when asked about his longer-term vision for Gaza, Netanyahu said there could be no political resolution as long as Hamas is in power.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a political resolution with those who are committed to your dissolution, to your destruction. That\u2019s absurd,\u201d he said.

Trump is attending centennial commemorations in Paris this weekend to mark the Armistice that ended World War I. (Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press)\n\nPARIS \u2014 For President Donald Trump in Paris, America First meant largely America alone.\n\nAt a weekend commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, the president who proudly declares himself a \u201cnationalist\u201d stood apart, even on a continent where his brand of populism is on the rise.\n\nHe began his visit with a tweet slamming the French president\u2019s call for a European defense force, arrived at events alone and spent much of his trip out of sight in the American ambassadors\u2019 residence in central Paris. On Sunday, he listened as he was lectured on the dangers of nationalist isolation, and then he headed home just as the inaugural Paris Peace Summit was getting under way.\n\nThe visit made clear that, nearly two years after taking office, Trump has dramatically upended decades of American foreign policy posture, shaking allies. That includes French President Emmanuel Macron, who on Sunday warned that the \u201cancient demons\u201d that caused World War I and millions of deaths were once again making headway.\n\nMacron, who has been urging a re-embrace of multinational organizations and cooperation that have been shunned by Trump, delivered a barely-veiled rebuke of Trumpism at the weekend\u2019s centerpiece event: A gathering of dozens of leaders at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the base of the Arc de Triomphe to mark the passage of a century since the guns fell silent in a global war that killed millions. Bells tolled across Europe\u2019s Western Front and fighter jets passed overhead to mark the exact moment the devastating war came to a close.\n\nWith Trump and other leaders looking on, Macron took on the rising tide of populism in the United States and Europe and urged leaders not to turn their backs by turning inward.\n\n\u201cPatriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism: Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,\u201d Macron said, adding that, when nations put their interests first and decide \u201cwho cares about the others\u201d they \u201cerase the most precious thing a nation can have... Its moral values.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump was gone, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who recently announced that she will not be seeking re-election, made an impassioned plea for global cooperation at the peace forum, saying World War I had \u201cmade clear what disastrous consequences a lack of compromise in politics and diplomacy can have.\u201d\n\nTrump, who has made clear that he has limited patience for broad, multilateral agreements, sat mostly stone-faced as he listened to Macron, who sees himself as Europe\u2019s foil to the rising nationalist sentiment, which has taken hold in Hungary and Poland among other countries.\n\nTrump did engage with his fellow leaders, attending a group welcome dinner hosted by Macron at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay on Saturday night and a lunch on Sunday. He also spent time with Macron on Saturday, when the two stressed their shared desire for more burden-sharing during a quick availability with reporters.\n\nBut Trump was terse during some of his private conversations with world leaders, according to people with direct knowledge of his visit. One of the people described the president as \u201cgrumpy.\u201d They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations.\n\nThe symbolism during Trump\u2019s visit couldn\u2019t have been more stark.\n\nTrump was missing from one of the weekend\u2019s most powerful images: A line of world leaders, walking shoulder to-shoulder in a somber, rain-soaked procession as the bells marking the exact moment that fighting ended \u2014 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918 \u2014 finished tolling.\n\nThe president and first lady Melania Trump had traveled to the commemoration separately \u2014 White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited security protocols \u2014 from the other dignitaries, who had traveled together by bus from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s motorcade was making its solo trip down the grand Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, which was closed to traffic, at least one topless woman breached tight security, running into the street and shouting \u201cfake peace maker\u201d as the cars passed. She had slogans, including the words \u201cFake\u201d and \u201cPeace,\u201d written on her chest.\n\nPolice tackled the woman and the motorcade continued uninterrupted. The feminist activist group Femen later claimed responsibility.\n\nAlso traveling on his own was Russian President Vladimir Putin, who shook Trump\u2019s hand, flashed him a thumbs-up sign and patted Trump\u2019s arm as he arrived. Trump responded with a wide smile.\n\nNational Security Adviser John Bolton had said at one point that Putin and Trump would meet in Paris, but they will instead hold a formal sit-down later this month at a world leaders\u2019 summit in Buenos Aires. A Kremlin official said later that U.S. and Russian officials decided to drop plans for the Paris meeting after French officials objected.\n\nTrump, who ran on an \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform, has jarred European allies with his actions. He has slapped tariffs on the European Union, pulled the U.S. out of the landmark Paris Climate Accord and the Iran nuclear deal and suggested he might be willing to pull the U.S. out of NATO if member counties don\u2019t significantly boost their defense spending. Trump\u2019s eagerness to get along with the Russian leader \u2014 in spite of Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election and numerous other aggressive moves in recent years \u2014 has alarmed those who view Russia as a growing threat.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly branded himself a \u201cnationalist,\u201d despite criticism from some that the term has negative connotations. At a news conference last week, Trump defended his use of the phrase. \u201cYou know what the word is? I love our country,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cYou have nationalists. You have globalists. I also love the world and I don\u2019t mind helping the world, but we have to straighten out our country first. We have a lot of problems.\u201d\n\nBut Trump did not broach the divide as he paid tribute Sunday to U.S. and allied soldiers killed in World War I during \u201ca horrible, horrible war\u201d that marked America\u2019s emergence as a world power.\n\n\u201cWe are gathered together at this hallowed resting place to pay tribute to the brave Americans who gave their last breath in that mighty struggle,\u201d Trump said at the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial in the suburbs of Paris, where more than 1,500 Americans who died in the war are buried.\n\n\u201cIt is our duty to preserve the civilization they defended and to protect the peace they so nobly gave their lives to secure one century ago,\u201d he said after spending a moment, standing alone amid the cemetery\u2019s white crosses, holding a black umbrella.\n\nThe Veterans Day speech came a day after Trump was criticized for failing to visit a different American cemetery about 60 miles (100 kilometers) outside of Paris on Saturday because rain grounded the helicopter he had planned to take. A handful of senior administration officials, including White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, went in the president\u2019s place, while Trump remained behind at the ambassador\u2019s residence with no alternate schedule for hours.\n\nTrump delivered the speech as other leaders were gathered for the inaugural Paris Peace Forum, which aims to revive collective governance and international cooperation to tackle global challenges. Afterward he headed back to Washington.\n\nFrance was the epicenter of World War I, the first global conflict. Its role as host of the main international commemoration highlighted the point that the world mustn\u2019t stumble into war again, as it did so quickly and catastrophically with World War II.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Robert Burns and Julie Pace in Washington and Lori Hinnant and Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press\u2019 WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___\n\nFollow Superville and Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/dsupervilleap and https://twitter.com/colvinj\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The nation of Poland regained its sovereignty at the end of World War I after being wiped off the map for more than a century. (Alik Keplicz/Associated Press)\n\nWARSAW, Poland \u2014 Poland\u2019s president, prime minister and other top political figures led an Independence Day march Sunday as part of a day of centenary celebrations, trailed by a huge crowd led by nationalist groups.\n\nMore than 250,000 people marched in Warsaw to mark the 100th anniversary of Poland\u2019s rebirth as an independent state at the end of World War I, according to police.\n\nPresident Andrzej Duda, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and the leader of the conservative ruling party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, walked in a crowd fronted by soldiers carrying a huge flag words \u201cFor You Poland.\u201d\n\nWalking a small distance behind them was another crowd of nationalists and their supporters, many of them burning firecrackers and flares, creating flashes of red light and smoke.\n\nMost in that contingent carried national white-and-red flags, but some held flags of the National Radical Camp, a far-right group and one of the main march organizers. The camp\u2019s flag has a falanga, a far-right symbol dating to the 1930s of a stylized hand with a sword.\n\nThere were also a few flags of Forza Nuova, an Italian group whose leader, Roberto Fiore, describes himself as fascist. One of the organizers of the march, Krzysztof Bosak, insisted that Forza Nuova are nationalists who are in touch with the Polish group.\n\nAmong the slogans that participants shouted were \u201cUSA, empire of evil\u201d and \u201cPoland, white and Catholic.\u201d Members of one nationalist group, eurosceptic All-Polish Youth, burned a European Union flag. An EU flag was also burned at another nationalist rally in Wroclaw. The city\u2019s mayor dissolved the march by nationalists toward its end, during speeches by far-right leaders.\n\nOver the past decade, nationalist organizations have held Independence Day marches in Warsaw on Nov. 11 that have included racist slogans, flares and in some years, acts of aggression.\n\nSunday\u2019s was by far the largest Independence Day march to date, and it was mostly peaceful. Government spokeswoman Joanna Kopcinska called it \u201cthe biggest march of free Poles in a free Poland.\u201d\n\nThis year, in honor of the centennial, state officials sought to hold one big government-led march for Sunday\u2019s ceremonies. At first, negotiations broke down over requests for the radical groups to leave banners at home, but an agreement on a joint march was reached on Friday.\n\n\u201cLet this be our joint march, let it be a march for everyone, a march where everyone wants to be and feels good, marching for Poland,\u201d Duda said at the start of the march.\n\nDuda and the government faced criticism from liberal opposition politicians for their willingness to negotiate with nationalists, including some who have made anti-Semitic comments in the past. After some individuals showed up with extremist emblems, the state officials \u2014 surrounded by security \u2014 appeared to try to keep some distance from the nationalists, marching ahead of them on the same route.\n\nThroughout the day, observances, Masses, marathons and fireworks were held in cities and small towns to commemorate the nation\u2019s statehood regained at the end of World War I, after 123 years of foreign rule.\n\nThe national flag fluttered from buildings, buses and cars, while dignitaries and regular citizens placed flowers at memorials to the father of Polish independence, Marshal Jozef Pilsudski. The historic Sigismund Bell, reserved only for the most important national events, rang out over Krakow.\n\nMarch participant Bartlomiej Mazur, 23, who travelled 320 kilometers (200 miles) to the capital, said he wanted to show that \u201cPoland is a strong, proud nation. We have freedom and we have the right to manifest our feelings and our pride in our country.\u201d\n\nThe ceremonies in Poland coincide with world leaders gathering in Paris on Sunday to mark a century since the armistice of what was then called the Great War.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Ludovic Marin/Pool Photo via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nPARIS \u2014 World leaders with the power to make war but a duty to preserve peace solemnly marked the end of World War I\u2019s slaughter 100 years ago at commemorations Sunday that drove home the message \u201cnever again\u201d but also exposed the globe\u2019s new political fault lines.\n\nAs Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and dozens of other heads of state and government listened in silence, French President Emmanuel Macron used the occasion, as its host, to sound a powerful and sobering warning about the fragility of peace and the dangers of nationalism and of nations that put themselves first, above the collective good.\n\n\u201cThe old demons are rising again, ready to complete their task of chaos and of death,\u201d Macron said.\n\n\u201cPatriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism. Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,\u201d he said. \u201cIn saying \u2018Our interests first, whatever happens to the others,\u2019 you erase the most precious thing a nation can have, that which makes it live, that which causes it to be great and that which is most important: Its moral values.\u201d\n\nTrump, ostensibly the main target of Macron\u2019s message, sat stony-faced. The American president has proudly declared himself a nationalist. But if Trump felt singled out by Macron\u2019s remarks, he didn\u2019t show it. He later described the commemoration as \u201cvery beautiful.\u201d\n\nAs well as spelling out the horrific costs of conflict to those with arsenals capable of waging a World War III, the ceremony also served up a joyful reminder of the intense sweetness of peace, when high school students read from letters that soldiers and civilians wrote 100 years ago when guns finally fell silent on the Western Front.\n\nBrought alive again by people too young to have known global war themselves, the ghostly voices seemed collectively to say: Please, do not make our mistakes.\n\n\u201cI only hope the soldiers who died for this cause are looking down upon the world today,\u201d American soldier Capt. Charles S. Normington wrote on Nov. 11, 1918, in one of the letters. \u201cThe whole world owes this moment of real joy to the heroes who are not here to help enjoy it.\u201d\n\nThe Paris weather \u2014 gray and damp \u2014 seemed aptly fitting when remembering a war fought in mud and relentless horror.\n\nThe commemorations started late, overshooting the centenary of the exact moment when, 100 years earlier at 11 a.m., an eerie silence replaced the thunder of war on the front lines. Macron recalled that 1 billion shells fell on France alone from 1914-1918 .\n\nAs bells marking the armistice hour rang across Paris and in many nations ravaged by the four years of carnage, Macron and other leaders were still on their way to the centennial site at the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nUnder a sea of black umbrellas, a line of leaders led by Macron and his wife, Brigitte, marched in silence on the cobbles of the Champs-Elysees, after dismounting from their buses.\n\nTrump arrived separately, in a motorcade that drove past three topless protesters with anti-war slogans on their chests who somehow got through the rows of security and were quickly bundled away by police. The Femen group claimed responsibility. French authorities said the three women faced charges of sexual exhibitionism. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited security protocols for the presidential motorcade\u2019s solo trip down the grand flag-lined avenue, which was closed to traffic.\n\nLast to arrive was the Russian president, Putin, who shook Trump\u2019s hand and flashed him a thumbs-up. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was positioned in pride of place between Trump and Macron, an eloquent symbol of victors and vanquished now standing together, shoulder to shoulder. Overhead, fighter jets ripped through the sky, trailing red, white and blue smoke in homage to the French flag.\n\nThe geographical spread of the more than 60 heads of state and government who attended, silent and reflective, showed how the \u201cwar to end all wars\u201d left few corners of the earth untouched but which, little more than two decades later, was followed so quickly and catastrophically by the even deadlier World War II.\n\nOn the other side of the globe, Australia and New Zealand held ceremonies to recall how the war killed and wounded soldiers and civilians in unprecedented numbers and in gruesome new, mechanized ways.\n\nThose countries lost tens of thousands of soldiers far away in Europe and, most memorably in the 1915 battle of Gallipoli, in Turkey. In central London, Britain\u2019s Queen Elizabeth II, clad in black, watched from a balcony as her son Prince Charles laid a wreath on her behalf at the foot of the Cenotaph memorial that honors the fallen. Britain had 880,000 military dead in the war.\n\nThe gulf between Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d credo and European leaders was starkly underscored again later Sunday, when Trump went his own way.\n\nHe visited an American cemetery outside Paris at precisely the moment that Macron, Merkel and other dignitaries were opening a peace forum where the French leader again sounded the alarm about crumbling international harmony as he ruminated about the legacy of the morning\u2019s commemorations.\n\n\u201cWill it be the shining symbol of durable peace between nations or will it be a picture of a last moment of unity before the world goes down in new disorder?\u201d Macron asked. \u201cIt depends only on us.\u201d\n\nWhile praising France for \u201ca wonderful two days,\u201d Trump described his rainy stop at the American cemetery at Suresnes as \u201cthe highlight of the trip.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Trump drew criticism for canceling a separate commemorative visit to the Belleau Wood battleground northeast of Paris because of rain.\n\nRemembered for brutal trench warfare and the first use of chemical weapons, WWI pitted the armies of France, the British empire, Russia and the U.S. against a German-led coalition that included the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires. Almost 10 million soldiers died, sometimes tens of thousands on a single day.\n\nThe U.S. came late to the war, in April 1917, but over 1\u00bd years it became a key player and tipped the scales for the allies. At the war\u2019s end, the U.S. had 2 million troops in Europe and another 2 million ready to cross the Atlantic if needed, a force that turned the United States into a major military power whose soldiers then fought and died again for Europe in World War II.\n\nEven though Germany was at the heart of provoking two world wars over the past century, the nation has become a beacon of European and international cooperation since.\n\nWith so many leaders in Paris, the commemoration also provoked a flurry of diplomacy on the sidelines, with conflict in Yemen and Syria among the hot-button issues.\n\nOn Sunday, Merkel met with the head of the United Nations, an organization born from the ashes of World War II, and the president of Serbia.

The apparent suicide the sisters highlights the often secretive and risky attempts by Saudi women trying to flee abusive families. (NYPD via AP, File) (Associated Press)\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 The deaths of two young Saudi sisters, whose bodies washed up along the New York City waterfront last month, have shined a light on the often secretive and risky journeys Saudi women take to flee their homes, both within the kingdom and abroad.\n\nTala Farea, 16, and Rotana Farea, 23, ran away from home in Fairfax, Virginia before being placed in a shelter amid allegations they were abused at home. They then made their way to New York City, staying in high-end hotels and eventually maxing out the older sister\u2019s credit card.\n\nWhat happened next is still under investigation. Their bodies, fully clothed and showing no obvious signs of trauma, were found Oct. 24 along the rocky banks of the Hudson River wrapped together with tape.\n\nNew York City Police Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea said people who knew the Farea sisters in Virginia told investigators that they made statements within the last year indicating \u201cthat they would rather inflict harm on themselves \u2014 commit suicide \u2014 than return to Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nThat may be because in Saudi Arabia, women who try and flee have few good options. Under the kingdom\u2019s guardianship system women must have the approval of a male relative \u2014 such as a father, husband, brother, or even a son \u2014 to marry, obtain a passport or travel.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they continue to be subjected to the guardianship system ... to the more sort of sinister issues which include physical or sexual abuse that they face at home, we\u2019ve seen women in all these cases attempt to flee,\u201d said Human Rights Watch researcher Adam Coogle.\n\nCoogle said there are also women being pressured into marriages against their will. He did not specifically discuss the Farea sisters as their case is still under investigation.\n\nIn other instances, women are being barred by their guardians from marrying or their salaries are being confiscated.\n\nIf women who run away are caught, they can be pressured to return home or placed in shelters where often the only way out is to escape again. Others are jailed and only a male guardian can sign for their release.\n\nLast year, Saudi women\u2019s rights activist Mariam al-Otaibi spent more than 100 days in the women\u2019s section of al-Malaz prison in Riyadh after her father filed a complaint to police against her for leaving home. She\u2019d moved from the ultraconservative province of Qassim to the capital, where supporters helped her rent an apartment and find work.\n\nShe was released after her case attracted the attention of activists and rights groups.\n\nAlso last year, a plea for help by a 24-year-old Saudi woman triggered a firestorm on social media with people seeking details about her disappearance. In an online video, Dina Ali Lasloom said her passport was confiscated at an airport in the Philippines on her way to Australia where she planned to seek asylum.\n\nWomen\u2019s rights advocates in Saudi Arabia said Lasloom was ultimately forced to board a plane to the kingdom with two of her uncles, who flew from Riyadh to stop her. They said authorities then took her to a women\u2019s shelter because of the attention around her case. A Saudi woman who tried to meet Lasloom at the airport in Riyadh to assist her was detained for several days by authorities.\n\nA group of Saudi women\u2019s rights activists had raised money locally for runaways and were planning to start a non-governmental organization to shelter abused women. But in May, authorities arrested at least nine of them and three of their male supporters. They remain detained on vague charges related to national security.\n\nFor runaway Saudi women, fleeing can be a matter of life and death, and they are almost always doing so to escape male relatives.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem Saudi society is grappling with. State-aligned newspapers report when women flee shelters and articles question the level of care and support women receive at such facilities.\n\nThe shelters have been described by Saudi activists as prison-like. Women inside cannot freely access the internet or mobile phones, their movements are restricted and often the only way to leave is with the signature of a male guardian. The shelters say they offer women psychiatric care and therapy, but do not take in women who, for example, are pregnant out of wedlock. Premarital sex can lead to criminal prosecution in Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries.\n\nThe most recent statistics from the Ministry of Labor and Social Development show that 577 Saudi women tried to flee their homes in 2015. That figure is likely to be much higher in reality because many families don\u2019t report runaways due to social stigma.\n\nThe Farea sisters had moved to the U.S. from Saudi Arabia with their mother and two brothers in 2015. The father spent time between the two countries, according to Arab News, which spoke to a relative.\n\nInvestigators say they believe the Farea sisters had filed for asylum. One of the problems women face in seeking asylum, though, is proving abuse.\n\n\u201cYou have to have evidence for it and unless you have a threatening text (message), you may not have a very good asylum case,\u201d said Coogle of Human Rights Watch.\n\nAfter the Farea sisters died, witness called police with something he said had been \u201chaunting\u201d him. He\u2019d seen the sisters standing apart at Riverside Park in New York, with their heads bowed into their hands praying loudly hours before their bodies were found. Investigators have stopped short of saying the sisters killed themselves, but say they have \u201cno credible information that any crime took place.\u201d\n\nThe sisters\u2019 bodies were returned to Saudi Arabia on Nov. 3 and they were buried the same day in Medina \u2014 home to one of Islam\u2019s holiest sites where the Prophet Muhammad is buried.\n\n\u201cThis is a tragedy all the way around,\u201d said Shea, the chief of detectives in New York.\n\n___\n\nFollow Aya Batrawy on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ayaelb .\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Rich Pedroncelli/Associated Press)\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2014 Smoke from the raging Northern California wildfires seeped into the Golden 1 Center, giving LeBron James a headache and leading Los Angeles Lakers coach Luke Walton to shorten his players\u2019 stints on the court.\n\nBut the haze did little to slow James and the Lakers, who used their best defensive effort of the year to earn a 101-86 win Saturday night against the Sacramento Kings, lifting Los Angeles to .500 (6-6) for the first time this season.\n\nJames scored 25 points and recently signed Tyson Chandler had 12 rebounds for the Lakers, who began the season with three straight losses but now have won four of their last five.\n\nThe Lakers held the Kings, who entered the game averaging 118 points per contest, to their lowest scoring total of the season. It was only the second time Sacramento has been held below 100 points this season, and it marked the first time Los Angeles had held an opponent below 100.\n\n\u201cWe won the game tonight because of our defense,\u201d Walton said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve been showing glimpses of that defense, but tonight was the first time we\u2019ve been able to put it together for long stretches.\u201d\n\nJames hit three 3-pointers and had seven rebounds. He only had two assists, though he often fed teammates for open shots that missed - including Lonzo Ball, who was 2 for 10 from the field.\n\nChandler, playing in his second game with the Lakers, logged 23 minutes and scored three points. In his first game, the Lakers held Minnesota to 110 points \u2014 which, up until Saturday night\u2019s game, was tied for the lowest by any Los Angeles opponent this season.\n\n\u201cFor me, the defense has been easy because it comes naturally, but it\u2019s a matter of getting into the offense,\u201d Chandler said. \u201cThe key for us was getting back on transition, building walls, forcing them into a half-court offense.\u201d\n\nJames said the Lakers\u2019 center duo of starter JaVale McGee and Chandler, who combined for 20 rebounds and a pair of steals, has solidified a defense that struggled early in the season.\n\n\u201c(Chandler) just shored up our front court. We have a great 1-2 punch now with JaVale and Tyson,\u201d James said.\n\nDe\u2019Aaron Fox had 17 of his 21 points in the first half to lead the Kings, who shot 35 percent from the field and went 6 for 25 on 3-pointers. Willie Cauley-Stein added 12 points and 12 rebounds.\n\nFox said the Lakers were able to shut down the Kings\u2019 fast-paced offense by getting back quickly on defense.\n\n\u201cThey got back every shot attempt and they sent four people back,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t shoot the ball well.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers were ahead by six points at the half and held a 76-65 lead entering the fourth quarter. They built that lead to 20 points at 88-68 before the Kings responded with a 10-0 run, but Sacramento got no closer.\n\nON THE REBOUND\n\nThe Lakers had a season-high 59 rebounds, including a season-best 17 on the offensive end. Five of Chandler\u2019s rebounds were offensive, while McGee had three of his eight rebounds on offense.\n\nLEBRON\u2019S RETURN\n\nJames made his NBA debut in Sacramento 15 seasons ago as the No. 1 overall draft pick of the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Bernstein/Getty Images)\n\nFor political nerds, election nights are seductive. After weeks of tracking polls and assessing campaign ads, it can be both frustrating and nerve-racking to watch results slowly trickle in. Each new batch of results from another 5 percent of precincts and, hey! Your candidate is only down by 5 points!\n\nBy now, watching returns on election night has gotten more sophisticated with a bevy of tools that provide more detailed analysis of where the election is likely to end up. But often that\u2019s not what\u2019s conveyed to casual observers, particularly those watching on cable news. Invariably, some new cache of votes will be logged and there will be CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, marveling at how so-and-so has just taken the lead.\n\nIt\u2019s a visceral sensation, like that of watching a football game. It\u2019s impossible not to see a narrowing between the candidates as the race is getting close, the drama increasing. Like the New England Patriots scoring a touchdown to take the lead in the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl. Things are starting to get good.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t how vote-counting works. There\u2019s no real drama at play; the candidates aren\u2019t actually getting closer or further apart as votes are counted. The proper analogy is not of scoring points in the Super Bowl. It\u2019s as though all of the points were scored in the Super Bowl and they were just slowly unveiled to the viewing audience.\n\nFor example. We took all of the scoring in the most recent Super Bowl and made a tool that adds each touchdown, extra point and field goal to either team\u2019s total at random. Click the button below.\n\nEvery second, more points are added. Sometimes, the Patriots run up the score quickly. Sometimes, the Eagles do. Sometimes, the scoring goes back and forth, just as it did in the actual game. But either way, the result is the same: The Eagles win. The drama of who scores when neither changes that outcome nor reflects any actual drama in the game itself. It\u2019s just an artifact of how the results are displayed.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the tool above reinforces how silly it is to announce loudly what the score is when only 20 percent of the scoring plays have been tallied. Maybe all of those are Eagles\u2019 points! That doesn\u2019t mean that the Patriots are about to get shut out. Once you start seeing 80, 90 percent of the scoring plays counted toward the total, you have a much better sense of what the eventual outcome is going to be.\n\nAgain: If you want to know who\u2019s likely to actually win as results come in, visit a site like the New York Times\u2019 Upshot, which shows where votes are still outstanding and uses those to predict how the night is likely to flow. If you simply want the thrill of watching numbers jockey back-and-forth next to one another, feel free to track minute-by-minute results and tune in to Mr. Blitzer.\n\nJust don\u2019t expect it\u2019s going to tell you much.", "\n\nRobert De Niro returns to SNL to portray Robert Mueller. (SNL)\n\nSince Trump\u2019s presidency began, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d has focused on news from the administration for its cold open. This week was no different. But instead of commenting on the midterm elections or Trump\u2019s insulting behavior toward journalists \u2014 particularly African American women \u2014 it chose to focus on the resignation of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nSessions retired this past Wednesday at President Trump\u2019s request. Many believe Trump was angry because Sessions recused himself from \u201cinvestigations related to the 2016 presidential campaign,\u201d led by special counsel Robert S.

Instead, the sketch was mostly a showcase for SNL\u2019s top impersonations of the political elite.\n\n[Dan Crenshaw on 'SNL': Meet the Navy SEAL-turned-congressman who roasted Pete Davidson]\n\nIt begins with Aidy Bryant\u2019s Sarah Sanders walking into the office of Sessions. He \u2014 cartoonishly portrayed by Kate McKinnon \u2014 is hiding inside of a desk at the time. (\u201cI was just hiding out and hoping to give the new Attorney General a real scare,\u201d (s)he says.)\n\n\u201cThis is Matthew G. Whitaker\u2019s office now, Jeff,\u201d SNL\u2019s Sanders informs him.\n\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d McKinnon\u2019s Sessions replies. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how Mr. Trump could replace me with Matt Whitaker. He\u2019s just a shady businessman with no experience who\u2019s blindly loyal to Donald Trump. Okay, hearing it out loud, that makes sense.\u201d\n\nThe show then trots out its various political characters, but not before the show\u2019s version of Sessions takes a few moments to reflect.\n\n\u201cSure did have some good times here during my almost 16 months as the Attorney General,\u201d SNL\u2019s Sessions says before picking up a Bible. \u201cMy trusted Bible. I justified a lot of bad things with this book.\u201d\n\nLater, the fake Sessions picks up a copy of Bob Woodward\u2019s newest book \u201cFear\u201d and says, \u201cIn chapter 26, the president calls me \u2018mentally retarded.\u2019\u201d\n\nCue SNL\u2019s political impersonators.\n\nFirst up is Beck Bennett\u2019s take on Mike Pence, though he barely has any lines.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry this is happening,\u201d he tells McKinnon\u2019s Sessions.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d (s)he replies. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand what I did wrong, you know?

I mean, there\u2019s even a chance they\u2019re' going to come after me and Eric.\u201d\n\nAmusing as the beginning of the sketch is, though, it\u2019s all merely setup for the one-two punch at the end.\n\nFirst, SNL\u2019s Sessions sits for a moment with a photo of Trump, saying,\u201cAfter all we\u2019ve been though, I would have at least thought you\u2019d say goodbye.\u201d\n\nThen he starts earnestly singing Adele\u2019s heartbreak anthem \u201cSomeone Like You\u201d while images from former sketches with McKinnon\u2019s Sessions and Alec Baldwin\u2019s Trump pop up in the background.\n\nThen SNL brings back Robert De Niro as Mueller.\n\n\u201cI just came to say thanks with all your help with the investigation,\u201d he says, later adding, \u201cI have something for you Jeff. You know in Harry Potter, when an elf gets a piece of clothing, it sets him free? This is for you.\u201d\n\nHe then hands Sessions \u201ca piece of toilet paper from the bottom of Mr. Trump\u2019s shoe.\u201d\n\nFinally, they hug and belt out Adele\u2019s anthem together.\n\nAfter being criticized for using too many guest stars last year, SNL\u2019s choice to bring back De Niro is interesting. It doesn\u2019t necessarily signal that the show is going back to its guest-heavy cold opens \u2014 but it certainly raises the question. Last year, everyone from Ben Stiller to Stormy Daniels appeared in the show\u2019s cold opens. Is that happening again?

It refused to let inconveniences mount into crises, manned its way through a 27-7 win in a ballyhooed bout with No. 17 Boston College, reached 10-0 this season, reached 50-4 over the past four and reached 82-11 over the past seven.\n\n[Game summary: Clemson 27, Boston College 7]\n\nFurther, it looked as if, barring something freaky or even creepy, it will appear in a fourth consecutive College Football Playoff, where it pretty much keeps a home with a mailbox, a picket fence and maybe even some house pets. To get there, it must beat Duke (7-3) at home, South Carolina (5-4) at home and whoever turns up in the ACC championship game, a game it will grace as the first ACC team to win four straight divisions, a reality clinched here.\n\n\u201cIt is a real credit to this senior group and this junior group,\u201d Coach Dabo Swinney said. \u201cThis is a very focused football team. They believe in their vision. They believe in what they want to achieve, and they\u2019re willing to put the work in, and it\u2019s just a joy to be around them every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been unbelievable,\u201d the senior receiver Hunter Renfrow said. \u201cFour divisions.\u201d\n\nAgainst a Boston College team that played with fight and suffered the loss of quarterback Anthony G. Brown after one offensive series, Clemson mastered most of the football details. It led the total yardage 123-6 after the first quarter, 216-23 at halftime, 265-49 after three quarters and 424-113 at the end. When a special teams play led to Alumni Stadium\u2019s only real turbulence, Clemson quickly handled that potential saga as well.\n\n[College football winners and losers: Bedlam, Northwestern and a lot of chalk]\n\nMidway through the first quarter, Clemson punter Will Spiers took a snap, edged over to the right and sent off a suitable punt that smacked down and trickled further, ending up 43 yards upfield. When Boston College return man Michael Walker fielded the thing with two Clemson defenders near enough to put him in peril, it looked as if it wouldn\u2019t amount to much.\n\nWhen Walker eluded the Tigers and headed right, then went storming down the sideline for a 74-yard touchdown, the bulk of the 44,500 made the place shake, and the Eagles led 7-3.\n\nSo Clemson just commenced being Clemson.\n\nBy now, it has a small crowd of players who can improve its Saturdays with things normal people and players can\u2019t do. Those include catching footballs while lying down (as the surging Tee Higgins did once) or executing world-class fakes (as towering freshman quarterback Trevor Lawrence did often but twice in particular).\n\nIt looked so flawlessly unperturbed after the Eagles\u2019 touchdown that it took nine plays to go 70 yards to gain the last lead it would need, with Lawrence\u2019s pass up the right sideline to Higgins hogging half the yardage. Eventually it reached the 2-yard line late in the first quarter and seemed close to stalling as it had on its first possession, which resulted in a field goal.\n\nOn fourth down, Swinney opted against 7-6, and soon Lawrence faked the handoff to Christian Wilkins, the defensive tackle whose \u201churry\u201d had ended Brown\u2019s night. Lawrence flipped the ball over the hand of Boston College linebacker Connor Strachan in the shallow part of the end zone, into the waiting hands of tight end Milan Richard in the back.\n\nAfterward, the senior Wilkins materialized next to Swinney on the interview dais, began eating some chips loudly and then shared one with Swinney. \u201cHe\u2019s mad,\u201d Swinney said, \u201cthat we didn\u2019t hand it to him. I told him, \u2018This is gon\u2019 be wide open. You\u2019re the bait.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019ve got special talents, my running ability,\u201d the deeply experienced 315-pounder cracked, then said, \u201cI\u2019m in the scouting report now!\u201d\n\n[For Maryland football, loss to Indiana hurts in more ways than one]\n\nBy that point, Lawrence had completed 10 of his first 11 passes for 123 yards, and even with the game at merely 13-7 at halftime, it lacked any feel of anything unfamiliar brewing. Boston College (7-3), struggling understandably with backup EJ Perry at quarterback, once took a 32-yard loss on a snap that flew over Perry, took two more losses and faced that rare occasion in the football world, a fourth and 49. Even when the officials seemed to miss out on a penalty when Boston College appeared to interfere with a Clemson fair catch, the Tigers\u2019 defense merely lined up again and allowed no shenanigans, further proof of Clemson\u2019s rarefied maturity.\n\nTaking the ball in the third quarter after Boston College worked another forgivable fizzle, Clemson started at its own 36-yard line. The game would ask for really only one more successful drive just in case, so Lawrence and Clemson went ahead and whooshed through it. Running back Travis Etienne bounced out of some traffic and went left for 25 yards. Lawrence threw to 10th-year senior Renfrow, one of those seniors who seems to have been around for half-forever, and Renfrow put a swell move on a defensive back to reach the 6-yard line.\n\nFrom there, Lawrence conducted a fake that belongs in any Hall of Fame of fakes, and Etienne headed into the right side of the line, drawing the attention of most every potential menace around him. While he did that without the ball, Lawrence skirted around to the left, alone, for a 20-7 lead. With 29 completions in 40 attempts for 295 yards, he had shooed any pregame uncertainty about whether a Georgian freshman who plays in South Carolina could handle the weather around Boston. \u201cSo actually, I thought about it afterward, I lived in Ohio when I was a little kid for a little while, so I guess that would count,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, people make such a big deal out of all that stuff, and we\u2019re just going to go out and play.\u201d\n\nAmari Rodgers\u2019s blazing 58-yard punt return up the left added only more. All along, Boston College barely budged, with bad luck again striking sophomore quarterback Brown.

(Marco Ugarte/Associated Press)\n\nQUERETARO, Mexico \u2014 Local Mexican officials were once again Sunday helping thousands of Central American migrants find rides on the next leg of their journey toward the U.S. border.\n\nAt a toll plaza to the west of the central Mexico city of Queretaro, where the group spent Saturday night, police helped find trucks to take migrants and prevented them from trying to stop drivers themselves.\n\nThe government of Queretaro said via Twitter that 6,531 migrants had moved through the state between Friday and Saturday. It said that 5,771 of those were departing Sunday morning after staying in three shelters it had prepared, the largest of which was a soccer stadium in the state capital.\n\nThose numbers appeared even higher than counts made by officials when the group was in Mexico City for several days, raising the possibility that other migrants have caught up to the main caravan.\n\nThe migrants began walking before dawn Sunday for Irapuato about 62 miles (100 kilometers) to the west after crossing into Guanajuato state, where local authorities also assisted them.\n\nA day earlier a similar scene played out as the caravan exited Mexico City. Dedicated metro trains moved migrants across the capital before dawn and at a toll plaza north of the city they formed orderly lines to wait for their turn to climb aboard passing 18-wheelers that were willing to help them cover the 124 miles (200 kilometers) to Queretaro.\n\nEmilson Manuel Figueroa managed a seat on the back of a flatbed truck packed with other migrants.\n\n\u201cI think that in my country I will get old and will never have something to live on,\u201d said the 23-year-old cab driver from Honduras.\n\nThe migrants appear to be on a path to Tijuana across the border from San Diego, which is still some 1,600 miles (2,575 kilometers) away.\n\nThe caravan became a campaign issue in U.S. midterm elections and U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of over 5,000 military troops to the border to fend off the migrants. Trump has also insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\n\nMany migrants say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, and they have now been on the road for weeks.\n\nMexico has offered refuge, asylum or work visas to the migrants, and its government said 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them while they wait for the 45-day application process for a more permanent status.\n\nBut most vowed to continue to the United States.\n\n\u201c(In the U.S.) we can earn more and give something to our family, but there (in Honduras) even when we want to give something to our children, we can\u2019t because the little we earn it\u2019s just for food, to pay the house and the light, nothing else,\u201d said Nubia Morazan, 28, of Honduras as she prepared to set out Sunday with her husband and two children.\n\n___\n\nAP writer Christopher Sherman in Mexico City contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Brown was injured on the play and left the game. (Elise Amendola/Associated Press)\n\nBOSTON \u2014 Boston College quarterback Anthony Brown was taken to a hospital with what his coach said were internal injuries after absorbing a crushing hit from 315-pound defensive lineman Christian Wilkins on the first series of the Eagles 27-7 loss to second-ranked Clemson on Saturday night.\n\nBrown was brought down by Wilkins , who landed on top of him, after getting off an incomplete pass on third-and-9. When the rest of the Eagles went to the sideline for the punting team, Brown remained on the field.\n\nHe was taken to the locker room, and the school announced in the second quarter that he would not return. Coach Steve Addazio said after the game Brown was taken to a hospital but declined to elaborate on the injury out of concern for the player\u2019s privacy.\n\n\u201cHopefully Anthony will be fine,\u201d Addazio said. \u201cI just don\u2019t have any idea where we\u2019re at with that.\u201d\n\nSecond-string quarterback EJ Perry took began warming up on the sideline, but his entry was delayed when the Eagles returned Clemson\u2019s punt for a touchdown.

Pittsburgh won 52-22. (Keith Srakocic/Associated Press)\n\nPITTSBURGH \u2014 Qadree Ollison looked at the line of scrimmage, looked at the Virginia Tech end zone 97 long yards away and turned to good friend and fellow Pittsburgh running back Darrin Hall.\n\n\u201cI asked him if he thought I could run that far and he was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019\u201d Ollison said with a laugh.\n\nThe answer unfolded over 17 seconds that began with textbook blocking at the snap, included a vicious stiff-arm at midfield and ended with Ollison flipping across the goal line to finish off the longest offensive play in the program\u2019s 114-year history to provide a giddy exclamation point as the Panthers took a massive step toward their first ACC Coastal Division title with a dominant 52-22 victory over the reeling Hokies on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt was perfect,\u201d Ollison said after finishing with 235 yards and three touchdowns. \u201cIt parted like the Red Sea and as a running back it\u2019s my job to make a guy miss. It\u2019s my job to run a guy over, not let one guy tackle you and after (breaking free), I did.\u201d\n\nYet it\u2019s what happened in the immediate aftermath that the Panthers believe speaks volumes about their team and the bond Ollison and Hall have formed over the last four years while taking turns atop the depth chart. Ollison\u2019s record-breaking sprint broke the previous record of 92 yards set by Hall set last season against Duke. And Hall couldn\u2019t have been happier.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad he got it,\u201d said Hall after running for 186 yards and a touchdown of his own on Senior Day. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing because he deserves it for everything he\u2019s done for this university.\u201d\n\nThe Panthers (6-4, 5-1 ACC) rolled up a school-record 654 total yards, 492 coming on the ground, the second-most ever given up by the Hokies (4-5, 3-3).\n\n\u201cObviously, we had trouble and they ran the ball awfully well,\u201d Virginia Tech head coach Justin Fuente said. \u201cKind of a weird deal ... we didn\u2019t play as well as we would\u2019ve liked to.\u201d\n\nRyan Willis threw for 231 yards and three touchdowns for the Hokies (4-5, 3-3), two of them to Eric Kumah, but Virginia Tech\u2019s defense offered little resistance. A season that began with such promise now finds the Hokies needing to win each of their final two games if they want to extend their bowl streak to 26 seasons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not foremost in my mind,\u201d Fuente said. \u201cI\u2019ve got plenty of other things to worry about right now.\u201d\n\nPitt\u2019s concerns are far different. The team that found itself floundering at 2-3 at the end of September after getting blown out by Central Florida now needs to win just one of its final two games to earn a trip to the ACC title game on the first Saturday in December.\n\n\u201cI know everyone wanted to jump ship after that (UCF) game but there was no doubt in my mind,\u201d Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett said. \u201cWe showed it with our play and how confident we are in each other.\u201d\n\nDespite the stakes, the Panthers insisted they were focused on avenging a 20-14 loss at Virginia Tech last November. Pitt had four chances from just outside the goal line in the final seconds to pull out the victory at Lane Stadium only to get stopped short, a setback that ultimately prevented the Panthers from earning a bowl bid.\n\nStill, Pitt head coach Pat Narduzzi said he wasn\u2019t worried about his team\u2019s ability to deliver if put in a similar spot, and the Panthers spent four quarters putting on a clinic. Hall and Ollison spent most of the afternoon roaring through gaping holes and responding in the second half whenever Virginia Tech attempted to get back in it.\n\n\u201cWhatever we wanted, we got,\u201d Pickett said. \u201cSo it was a good day.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nVirginia Tech: The Hokies don\u2019t appear interested in tackling anybody. Defensive coordinator Bud Foster hoped his young group would have learned after getting run over in losses to Georgia Tech and Boston College. Instead it was more of the same. Pitt\u2019s offensive line bullied Virginia Tech on a day the Panthers averaged 13.9 yards per play.\n\nPitt: The Panthers have developed a hard-earned reputation for stumbling when given an opportunity to produce a true breakthrough moment. It looked like the latest edition of \u201cPitt-ing\u201d might come in the second quarter when Pickett fumbled going into the end zone, Virginia Tech recovered for a touchback and then went down and scored to draw within 17-7. This time, however, the Panthers didn\u2019t panic. Pickett directed two touchdown drives before the end of the first half to put the Panthers up 31-7 at the break. The Hokies never drew closer than 16 the rest of the way.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nVirginia Tech: Welcomes Miami to Lane Stadium next Saturday.\n\nPitt: Travels to Wake Forest next Saturday in the first meeting between the two schools since Pitt joined the ACC in 2013.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Charlie Neibergall/Associated PRess)\n\nEvery now and then, a Status Quo Saturday arrives. It\u2019s one of 13 during the season, but effectively serves as a placeholder amid weekends filled with wacky finishes, unexpected finishes and a toppling of conventional wisdom.\n\nIt changes little and won\u2019t necessarily be remembered for much.\n\nThat sums up Saturday\u2019s action.\n\n[Complete FBS scoreboard for Week 11]\n\nAlabama: Never threatened in a 24-0 defeat of Mississippi State.\n\nThe one-loss Big Ten East powers: Ohio State pulled away from Michigan State for a 26-6 victory.

Undefeated Clemson shut down Boston College, 27-7, to clinch the ACC\u2019s Atlantic Division. Notre Dame pounced on Florida State quickly in a 42-13 rout in South Bend. Georgia smothered Auburn, 27-10, to remain in the playoff chase. And even two-loss Louisiana State largely dominated Arkansas, though the Razorbacks scored two fourth-quarter touchdowns to close within 24-17.\n\nThere were two exceptions to the mostly milquetoast day.\n\nFirst, look who\u2019s headed for the Big Ten title game. None other than Northwestern, which managed to out-Iowa Iowa in a 14-10 victory in Iowa City to seal the West Division. Isaiah Bowser rushed for 165 yards and a touchdown on 31 carries and Northwestern (6-4, 6-1 Big Ten) held Iowa to 64 rushing yards to earn its first trip to the league title game and a date with Michigan or Ohio State. Yes, the game was a slog. And yes, the fact that the Wildcats will be playing for a conference title despite failing to win a nonconference game points out how disappointing the Big Ten West has been this year. But it\u2019s decidedly not status quo.\n\nSecond, there was the aptly named Bedlam game. Oklahoma piled up 702 total yards, with Kyler Murray throwing for 349 yards and Kennedy Brooks and Trey Sermon combining for 289 yards and five touchdowns on the ground.\n\nYet Oklahoma State (which had 640 yards of its own) had a chance to take the lead when Coach Mike Gundy opted to go for two after Tyler Cornelius\u2019s 24-yard touchdown pass to Tylan Wallace on fourth and long with 1:03 to go. Gundy played to win \u2014 an ever-commendable choice \u2014 but the conversion failed and Oklahoma recovered the ensuing onside kick to seal a 48-47 victory.\n\nSo even the wild game of the afternoon advanced the status quo for another week. Alas, not every weekend can be chaotic. With some, the sport just has to settle for stability.\n\nWinners\n\nUAB.

There\u2019s still a chance to get to 10 wins by beating Middle Tennessee, Louisville and a bowl opponent, but the Wildcats will be hard-pressed to land the New Year\u2019s Six bid they very well may have earned if they got to 10-2.\n\nPurdue. Go ahead and try to figure out the Boilermakers, who over the last four weeks have blasted Ohio State, 49-20; slogged to a 23-13 loss at Michigan State; knocked off Iowa, 38-36; and now have a 41-10 loss at Minnesota to their credit.\n\nWould it surprise anyone if Purdue (5-5, 4-3 Big Ten) secured bowl eligibility with a thumping of Wisconsin next week, only to lose the Old Oaken Bucket to Indiana to close out the regular season?

Even so, in an interview with The Washington Post, the young man\u2019s father injected a dose of pessimism.\n\n\u201cIf mowing down 5-year-olds at Sandy Hook didn\u2019t make an impression, nothing will,\u201d Marc Orfanos said. \u201cThe bottom line is the NRA owns most of the Republican Party, and probably some of the Democratic Party as well. Until that vise is broken, this is not going to end.\u201d\n\nThousand Oaks began as a planned bedroom community for Los Angeles in the 1960s, and it has grown more diverse and more affluent since, with the median home price rising to $669,500 \u2014 twice the national average. It also has shifted its politics, becoming more Democratic, though Republicans are still the largest number of registered voters, 36 percent to the Democrats\u2019 34 percent, the rest with no party preference.\n\nThe city\u2019s state and federal representatives are now Democrats, and in 2016, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump here by a margin of nearly 10 percentage points in the presidential election. Republicans here are moderate, but it\u2019s still Reagan Country \u2014 the former president is buried just over the ridge in Simi Valley, at his grand presidential library.\n\nLike its neighbor Simi Valley, the area is still a magnet for law enforcement officers from Los Angeles and cowboys of all stripes. Sixty-something ranchers in straw boaters often swing college girls to the \u201cSweetheart Schottische\u201d on Borderline\u2019s dance floor.\n\n\u201cBy and large, this is a fairly conservative area with a high rate of homeownership and high incomes,\u201d said Herb Gooch, a political science professor at California Lutheran University. \u201cHistorically, it\u2019s been an area that\u2019s been fairly conservative, except on issues of the environment.\u201d\n\nWhen the black-cloaked gunman \u2014 who police identified as 28-year-old Ian David Long \u2014 shot his way into the bar and onto that dance floor Wednesday evening, he was carrying a .45-caliber Glock handgun, authorities said. Such handguns are common and legal.\n\nAdam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles and the author of \u201cGunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America\u201d said the shooting is likely to prompt state officials to pursue more stringent gun measures, noting that the Democratic governor-elect, Gavin Newsom, has vowed to take the issue on and to \u201craise the bar\u201d on gun control.\n\n\u201cCalifornia already has a strong political will to do this, it doesn\u2019t need the people of Ventura County to sign off on it,\u201d Winkler said.\n\nU.S. Rep. Julia Brownley (D-Calif.) said in a statement that the community \u201csupports gun safety legislation and increased resources for mental health.\u201d To do nothing, she said, \u201cis a morally bankrupt position.\u201d\n\nThe grieving and the vigils here were halted by a wildfire that swept through the area just after the shooting, prompting evacuation orders for about 75 percent of the community.

(Calla Kessler/The Washington Post)\n\nWith a pair of bulldozers rumbling in front of him through muddy terrain, Staff Sgt. Kevin Barr observed as the austere beginnings of an Army headquarters camp at the southern border slowly came together Saturday.\n\nAfter a night of rain and temperatures plummeting below 50 degrees, the open field they were living in \u2014 land provided by U.S. Customs and Border Protection \u2014 had turned into a gusty, mucky mess with the consistency of peanut butter.\n\nSoldiers had strung jagged concertina wire around the base\u2019s perimeter, pitched dozens of olive-green tents and lined up dozens of Humvees and heavy hauler trucks in the past week, but nothing much had been done yet to prepare for mud in typically dusty South Texas.\n\n\u201cIf we can get some gravel, we can potentially start graveling some of the areas and try to put a road here,\u201d Barr said. \u201cBecause this clay dirt is pretty thick.\u201d\n\nThe raw weather was the latest surprise for soldiers in a mission whose wheels shifted into motion amid President Trump\u2019s election-season warnings that an \u201cinvasion\u201d of migrants \u2014 many of them actually women and children \u2014 was heading north for the United States.\n\nThe deployment has been panned by critics as a politically motivated stunt to rally Trump\u2019s base for the midterm elections, even as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said late last month that \u201cwe don\u2019t do political stunts\u201d in the military. Less than a week later, the Pentagon stripped the operation of its name \u2014 Faithful Patriot \u2014 amid complaints that it was overtly political. Images of soldiers stretching out concertina wire at the border just before Election Day had just surfaced.\n\n\n\nA soldier stands in front of a flag during a training session at the base camp in Donna. (Calla Kessler/The Washington Post)\n\n[Former generals worry that Trump\u2019s border mission uses troops as a political tool]\n\nPublic attention has shifted away from the mission in recent days as the president has focused on other issues. But the military\u2019s lumbering deployment from San Diego to Brownsville, Tex., has continued despite questions about its necessity.\n\nThe caravan is still hundreds of miles from the border, and it set out this week instead for Tijuana, some 1,500 miles to the west. The mission is expected to extend through Dec. 15, keeping soldiers away from families through Thanksgiving and close to Christmas.\n\nAbout 5,600 service members had been dispatched as of Friday, according to the Pentagon. About 2,800 are in Texas, including more than 1,000 in Task Force Griffin, an Army unit that set down temporary roots in the Rio Grande Valley and has a corps of leaders from the 89th Military Police Brigade of Fort Hood, Tex.\n\nCol. Richard Ball, the task force commander, sought in a news conference Friday at a border point in Hidalgo, Tex., to stress that the U.S. military will not have a law enforcement role in the operation. That is considered a sticking point because of the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts active-duty troops from participating in such activities in most cases. U.S. troops are expected to have \u201cvery little to incidental contact\u201d with migrants, he said, and will take the direction of CBP officials if it occurs.\n\nAt the base camp in Donna, soldiers are counseled against discussing politics, a common refrain in any operation. But they also are careful in answering questions about how many soldiers live there, how long exactly they\u2019ll remain or what they\u2019ll be doing. At least two soldiers disagreed Saturday about whether their work should even be considered a deployment, considering they are still in the United States. News releases from the Pentagon continue to say that service members are deployed for border support.\n\nCapt. Lauren Blanton, an engineer officer stationed at Fort Knox, Ky., said she arrived in Donna more than a week ago with three other soldiers and found an open field. As \u201ccamp mayor,\u201d she has since overseen the installation of a trailer with 16 shower stalls, tents for a facility meeting day-to-day medical needs, and a single, massive tent that typically is used as a cafeteria for troops. However, given the number of soldiers coming through Donna, Army officials instead turned the large tent \u2014 the only one with heat in the camp \u2014 into living quarters for more soldiers.\n\nOn Saturday, more than 100 soldiers could be seen relaxing inside, some reading, others playing video games on their phones, still others tossing around a football, and one attempting to solve a Rubik\u2019s Cube. Hundreds of cots were spread out at least 18 across over a space larger than a hockey rink.\n\nCapt. Tim Smith, commander of the 977th Military Police Company of Fort Riley, Kan., said he and his soldiers arrived at Donna on Friday on buses from Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, more than 240 miles away. The unit received a few days of training there, learning basic phrases in Spanish and how to use Google Translate, he said.\n\n\u201cPotentially we\u2019re going somewhere else in the future, but right now, we don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of Smith\u2019s soldiers, 1st Sgt. Steven Howd, said he anticipated that the company would formulate a training plan once they knew their assignment.\n\n\u201cI actually expected the conditions to be even more austere than this,\u201d he said, sitting on a cot. \u201cI was really anticipating being even closer to the border and providing whatever force protection was necessary for our engineers to do their job, but without accommodations quite this nice.\u201d\n\nOutside in the cold, Sgt. Dacmen Ma of the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood watched the bulldozers work their magic in the mud. Once they pushed enough dirt into berms, Ma\u2019s team of soldiers planned to set up a massive fuel bladder for trucks, generators and other equipment.\n\nMa, who grew up in Houston, returned from a deployment to Iraq last year, he said. He never anticipated that he\u2019d receive another assignment in the field just a few hours away from home.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the time,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d think I\u2019d be overseas somewhere.\u201d\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story gave an incorrect rank for 1st Sgt.

Beto O'Rourke, the 2018 Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in Texas, makes his concession speech Tuesday night in El Paso. O'Rourke has been cited by some Democrats as a template for the party\u2019s 2020 nominee. (Eric Gay/AP)\n\nTuesday\u2019s midterm elections crystallized a choice among Democrats as they look to the 2020 presidential contest: Do they side with passion or pragmatism?\n\nAn energized segment within the party saw in the results a need for Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, or a candidate like him, who can inspire large crowds with an authentic and optimistic plea that rebukes President Trump, while only rarely mentioning him.\n\nOthers pointed to wins in the upper Midwest that suggest a wholly different formula, one that would rely on candidates like former vice president Joe Biden or Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio to stitch together the coalition of working-class voters that for decades helped put Democrats into the White House.\n\n\u201cI think we know what the ingredients are,\u201d said Rebecca Kirszner Katz, a Democratic strategist. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019re trying to figure out if that person exists.\u201d\n\nCandidates and party strategists in recent days have been working through the midterm results, looking for clues about what may resonate with voters, according to interviews with nearly two dozen candidates, aides and strategists.\n\nSome are daunted by Trump\u2019s strength and resilience even in a rough midterm election, suggesting the feat of unseating him is more difficult than many realize.\n\n\u201cThis was not a historic rebuke,\u201d said a Democratic strategist working for a prospective 2020 candidate, speaking on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment. \u201cHe\u2019s gotten his base to turn out twice. . . . I just don\u2019t think anybody should have any confidence. How many times do you have to be confident about Trump and then being proved wrong? People felt like 2016 was a fluke. And people are underestimating him again.\u201d\n\nOthers are optimistic about what they see as a loosening of Trump\u2019s grip on working-class voters who abandoned Democrats for him in 2016.\n\nWhat the midterm results did not do was cull a field that could be bigger and more unwieldy than any time in recent memory. Almost anyone pondering a bid could find a result that offered a reason to run, or just as quickly find a reason to take a pass.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the \u2018blue wall\u2019 reasserted itself again yielded some of the 2020 candidates an argument to say, \u2018I have the ability to appeal to Rust Belt voters, and that\u2019s the path to victory.\u2019 And I think they\u2019ll get a fair hearing on that,\u201d said Brian Fallon, a Democratic consultant who served as Hillary Clinton\u2019s press secretary in 2016. \u201cBut I tend to still think that activists in Iowa will still go where their heart leads them, and won\u2019t necessarily make some sort of pragmatic decision about who can appeal to Obama-Trump voters. They are more likely to gravitate to the candidate that most inspires them.\u201d\n\nThe debate between those options, which has played out quietly in the two years since Trump shocked the party and sent it into a leaderless tailspin, will be settled over the next year as a large field begins openly competing for various slices of the primary electorate. Already, candidates are recruiting staff members and identifying finance teams to help them in the first of many tests \u2014 raising money.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been aggressively building a national fundraising and political network, while Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) will follow up several recent trips to primary states with a high-profile book tour. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick is heading back to South Carolina on Friday, while Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said she\u2019s now considering a presidential bid after all but ruling it out.\n\nBefore now, one of the fundamental questions about the coming presidential campaign has been whether Democrats will push for a candidate to engage with Trump in a smash-mouth style that drives up partisans on both sides, or go for someone who attempts a more positive and uniting message. Many of the party\u2019s successes Tuesday leaned toward the latter.\n\n\u201cThe way to beat Trump is not to be like him,\u201d said David Axelrod, a Democratic consultant and former senior strategist for President Barack Obama. \u201cThere is this sort of debate of, \u2018Do you campaign with a clinched fist or an open hand?\u2019 The candidates who won did not win as instruments of destruction to Donald Trump. They ran for an alternate vision that was constructive and positive and spoke to the day-to-day concerns of people.\u201d\n\nCandidates like O\u2019Rourke \u2014 as well as gubernatorial candidates Andrew Gillum in Florida and Stacey Abrams in Georgia \u2014 ignited passion among Democrats across the country. They managed to raise huge amounts of money from everyday donors and created viral moments that propelled their state-based candidacies into national acclaim.\n\n\u201cIt was a template,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cThe thing that distinguished Beto O\u2019Rourke was not any one issue. It was his fundamental call to character, his fundamental call to community. I think there\u2019s a big lesson in that. We tend to be very tactical and parochial in how we think about these things. But there\u2019s something happening out there. I think the country is hungry for that.\u201d\n\nBut O\u2019Rourke didn\u2019t focus on Trump. And as the Democratic primary gets underway, there remain thirsty calls for a more aggressive posture against the president.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to beat this guy talking about puppies and daisies,\u201d said lawyer Michael Avenatti. \u201cYou have to inspire people, but you can\u2019t inspire people to win against Trump. Not in 2020. It\u2019s not going to happen. You have to get in the gutter with this guy and take shots. You have to take a lot of punishment and give a lot of punishment. He\u2019s going to roll over a nominee who seeks to be cheerleader.\u201d\n\nAvenatti gained national attention representing Stormy Daniels, who has claimed she and Trump had a dalliance. He has said he is considering a presidential bid on the basis that he is uniquely positioned to engage with Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not who among the Democrats can make the best president. If the Democrats answer that question they\u2019re very likely to lose the election in 2020,\u201d Avenatti said. \u201cThe question is: Who matches up against this particular individual at this point in time?\u201d\n\nWarren may attempt to cast herself as someone who can unite the different desires within the party \u2014 as the author of a populist message that could play well in the Midwest but who also has a knack for capitalizing on passionate and viral moments.\n\nDistinguishing herself from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who occupied similar political space in the 2016 campaign and may attempt to run again, she is also hoping to tap into the vast new energy of female candidates and activists.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, on a very dark election night, millions of women watched in horror as Donald Trump was elected president,\u201d she said in her victory speech Tuesday. \u201cThey didn\u2019t like it. But they didn\u2019t whimper. They didn\u2019t whine. They fought back. . . . And that is how real change begins.\u201d\n\nThere are quieter candidates, too, hoping to burst onto the national scene. Some have pointed toward Mitch Landrieu, the former mayor of New Orleans, as having raw political talent and a record of speaking forcefully against racism. Outgoing Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who helped campaign for candidates during the midterms, is planning to spend the coming months evaluating whether to run on a platform of bipartisan governance.\n\n\u201cAcross the Midwest we saw good pragmatic candidates who really wanted to get things done. They weren\u2019t looking for a soapbox and a place to shout out their ideas,\u201d Hickenlooper said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost the opposite of Trump; it\u2019s the antidote to Trump, where neither side ends up ecstatic or thrilled with the compromise. But everyone realizes this is progress. That\u2019s the way politics used to be in this country.\u201d\n\nBut his candidacy would test the question of whether there is space for that kind of politics.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the $62,000 question,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t create media.\u201d\n\nHeading into the midterm elections, many Democrats were hoping their flashy new stars \u2014 especially O\u2019Rourke, Gillum and Abrams \u2014 would win decisive victories, proving definitively that unabashedly liberal, young and dynamic candidates were the future not only of the party but of a rapidly diversifying country.\n\n\u201cPeople want us to chase this unicorn, the Obama-Trump voters,\u201d said Bakari Sellers, a political commentator and former South Carolina state representative. \u201cWe need to focus on the energy in our party. We just can\u2019t do the same thing we have been doing.\u201d\n\nBut none of the three won Tuesday \u2014 O\u2019Rourke was defeated, and Gillum\u2019s and Abrams\u2019s races remain up in the air. Some suggest that underscores the limits of the passion candidates, who tend to rile up both sides. Democrats running as more pragmatic messengers to working-class voters in states Trump won could at least claim success.\n\nBrown, who won reelection in Ohio and is known for his rumpled suits and raspy voice, raised eyebrows with an election night speech that implored Democrats to follow his path \u2014 if not him specifically.\n\n\u201cPopulists are not racists. Populists are not anti-Semitic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not appeal to some by pushing down others. We do not lie. We do not engage in hate speech. And we do not rip babies from their families at the border.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will show America how we celebrate organized labor and all workers \u2014 the waitress in Dayton, the office worker in Toledo, the nurse in Columbus, the mineworker in Coshocton,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat is the message coming out of Ohio in 2018, and that is the blueprint for our nation in 2020.\u201d\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar shares that lane after winning an easy reelection in Minnesota. Biden, who has made a career of calling himself \u201cmiddle-class Joe,\u201d is also a beneficiary of a strategy that goes through the Midwest.\n\nWithout a candidate who can relate to voters there, some Democrats argue, Trump has a chance to bounce back in the very places he won the presidency. Even amid Democratic wins in the Midwest on Tuesday, there were signs Trump had improved his standing.\n\nIn Michigan, where Democrat Gretchen Whitmer won the governorship, exit polls had Trump\u2019s approval rating at 44 percent. When Trump won the state in 2016, his favorability rating in exit polls was 39 percent.\n\n\u201cThe path for the Democrats runs through the Rust Belt. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any getting away from it,\u201d said Larry Rasky, a longtime Biden confidant and campaign strategist. \u201cThat\u2019s where Trump won. It\u2019s where he turned the tables, and it\u2019s where he lost Tuesday night.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you just do the math in 2020 it\u2019s hard to see a path for Democrats that doesn\u2019t start in Pennsylvania and end in Minnesota,\u201d Rasky said. \u201cThat formula was proved again Tuesday night. It\u2019s not that there aren\u2019t other ways to get there, but if we\u2019re going to rely on Texas and Florida to win in 2020, let\u2019s just find a pair of aces for a full house.\u201d\n\nA previous version of this story contained a graphic that showed Idaho and Maine as having two Democratic Senators.
