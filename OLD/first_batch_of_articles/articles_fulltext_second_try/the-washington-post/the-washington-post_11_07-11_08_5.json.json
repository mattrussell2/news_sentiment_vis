["Opinion columnist\n\nIn the wake of almost every mass shooting \u2014 a term which, by now, has become so familiar as to feel almost disconnected from the vicious slaughter of random people in ordinary places \u2014 the National Rifle Association and its fellow travelers make the same point: There are many more guns in circulation in the United States than murders, so the problem isn\u2019t guns, per se, but the people who turn them on innocents. The problem, they say, is mental health.\n\n\u201cSince 1966, the National Rifle Association has urged the federal government to address the problem of mental illness and violence,\u201d the NRA\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action said in 2013.\u201cThe NRA will support any reasonable step to fix America\u2019s broken mental health system without intruding on the constitutional rights of Americans.\u201d Yet, true to form, the same article also says, \u201cThe danger of overbroad mental health disqualifiers is already clear to tens of thousands of veterans,\u201d which is of particular interest in relation to this week\u2019s shooting in Thousand Oaks, Calif.\n\nIndeed, the Thousand Oaks shooting illuminates some of the most salient problems with the NRA\u2019s position that reducing mental illness, not guns, is the solution to the United States\u2019 nightmarish mass shooting problem.\n\nFirst, the Thousand Oaks shooter \u2014 who doesn\u2019t deserve to be named or go down in infamy, but to be forgotten as an actor and recognized only as a symptom of a problem \u2014 had been interviewed and cleared by a mental health specialist in April. But mental health isn\u2019t a static condition. People can and do experience mental health problems, recover, move on \u2014 and relapse, without any detectable pattern. A person on the verge of a serious mental health crisis today could be well again very soon, and vice versa, meaning that targeted interventions \u2014 such as check-ups, which can result in the confiscation of a person\u2019s weapons, or refusing firearm sales only to people with prior involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations \u2014 will likely fail to prevent mass killings.\n\nFor this reason, the argument that mental health is the root cause of mass shootings \u2014 which doesn\u2019t appear to be borne out by studies , not that the NRA cares about studies ; but to briefly put aside reality and take the claim for granted \u2014 doesn\u2019t actually militate against reducing guns in circulation. On the contrary, it seems to support that very course. If mental illness is something that can arise or be exacerbated at any time, without much notice, then reducing the number of guns in circulation would be an effective way to limit opportunities for those crises to become quickly and extremely lethal.\n\nOf course, NRA leaders aren\u2019t going to follow the logic where it goes. They\u2019re not even going to follow the group\u2019s own reasoning from point A to point B \u2014 say, from statements of concern about mental illness to efforts to do something about it. If the NRA were serious about mental health in the United States, it could publicly proclaim support for politicians who seek to expand health-care coverage for all Americans, and especially to those who support single-payer health care, which would cover mental health care and substance abuse treatment . And why not? The NRA thrives on a faux-populist platform, in which it attempts to pit average Americans in the heartland against snobby, rich coastal elites. Want to stick it to the man? Tax him and pay for universal health care.\n\nBut the NRA does not want to stick it to the man, or look out for everyday Americans, or solve our country\u2019s mental health-care crisis. It wants to keep guns on store shelves and keep the market for them wide and expansive, because gun and gun accoutrements manufacturers and retailers give them money and buy their advertising space. Everyone who comes between them and those checks \u2014 be they patrons hanging out at a nightclub, people suffering from mental illness, or citizens genuinely trying to make sense of a complex and disturbing phenomenon \u2014 is just another problem.", "Opinion writer\n\n* Robert Barnes reports that the Trump administration\u2019s effort to deport Dreamers has hit another snag:\n\nA federal appeals court ruled Thursday that President Trump cannot immediately end the \u201cdreamers act\u201d that shields from deportation young immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children. The unanimous decision by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit makes it more likely that the Supreme Court will settle the question. The Trump administration already has asked the justices to move quickly to add it to the docket for this term. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was begun in 2012 by President Barack Obama, and has protected nearly 700,000 people brought to this country as children.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t forget that if Trump actually wanted to protect them as he claims, their status could have been resolved a long time ago.\n\n* Devlin Barrett, Matt Zapotosky, and Josh Dawsey report that the new acting attorney general knows exactly what he\u2019s there for:\n\nActing attorney general Matt Whitaker has no intention of recusing himself from overseeing the special-counsel probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election, according to people close to him who added they do not believe he would approve any subpoena of President Trump as part of that investigation. Since stepping into his new role Wednesday, Whitaker has faced questions \u2014 principally from Democrats \u2014 about whether he should recuse himself from the Russia investigation, given that he has written opinion pieces about the investigation and is a friend and political ally of a witness. On Thursday, two people close to Whitaker said he has no intention of taking himself off the Russia case.\n\nIt would be kind of fun to imagine the paroxysm of rage Trump would fly into if he did recuse himself, as he certainly should. But he won\u2019t.\n\n* Julia Ainsley reports that the administration is about to unveil a draconian immigration plan, and thinks that Brett Kavanaugh will save it in the Supreme Court after the inevitable legal challenge.\n\n* Max Fisher and Josh Keller look at other countries around the world to debunk the theory that we have so many mass shootings for some reason other than the fact that we have so many guns.\n\n* Neal Katyal and George Conway, aka Mr. Kellyanne, argue that it\u2019s unconstitutional for President Trump to fire Jeff Sessions and put Whitaker in charge of the Justice Department, including the Mueller investigation.\n\n* Alice Miranda Ollstein and Rachel Roubein survey the state laws Republicans are hoping to use as vehicles for the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v.

C\u00f3rdova said she also suffered economic injury from delays, and the suit seeks a court order barring the alleged practice.\n\nThe suit comes as civil rights groups, labor unions and Democratic lawmakers have stepped up a campaign against U.S. travel and transportation companies this year, urging them to stop tactics that the companies say are not new but which Customs and Border Protection officials say have been on the rise under the Trump administration.\n\n[As Border Patrol searches its buses, Greyhound is pulled into immigration uproar]\n\nThis week, Motel 6, agreed to pay up to $8.9 million to settle a class-action lawsuit in federal court alleging that employees at two Phoenix properties provided the personal information of several Latino guests to immigration officials without a warrant, leading to their being detained. That lawsuit, filed in January, asserted that the motels invaded guests\u2019 privacy and discriminated against them on the basis of race and national origin.\n\nIn addition to targeting Greyhound, whose 1,600 vehicles move 17 million passengers a year in the United States, Canada and Mexico, critics of such tactics have conveyed objections to Amtrak and other bus companies.\n\n\u201cGreyhound\u2019s policy of voluntarily opening its bus doors to law enforcement officers to intimidate customers based on the color of their skin is not just offensive; it is unlawful. It needs to stop now,\u201d said Darren J. Robbins, founder of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, a San Diego law firm that specializes in class-action lawsuits and is representing C\u00f3rdova.\n\n[Motel 6 gave guest lists to ICE agents looking for \u2018Latino-sounding\u2019 names, lawsuit alleges]\n\nA Greyhound spokesman, when asked about contentions in the new lawsuit, referred to an October statement by the company addressing CBP practices, in which Greyhound said it understood its customers\u2019 concerns, called on Congress to change the law and said \u201cit will support positive efforts to do so.\u201d\n\nGreyhound said in the statement that it neither coordinates with nor supports the CBP\u2019s actions, adding, \u201cCBP officers do not ask permission to board our buses. We do not want to put our drivers\u2019 safety or the safety of our passengers at risk by attempting to stop a federal agent from conducting checks.\u201d\n\nThe Border Patrol, which is a part of the Customs and Border Protection agency, said its practice of targeting bus stations and other transportation hubs for human smuggling and drug trafficking is decades old, although the frequency and intensity of such checks has increased in response to rising threats. Border agents have broad authority to question people within 100 miles of a U.S. border, an area in which more than half the U.S. population lives.\n\nCritics of the stops say Greyhound also has a history of upholding its customers\u2019 civil rights, serving most famously as the vehicle for the \u201cFreedom Riders\u201d in 1961 who traveled on Greyhound buses to challenge racial segregation in public transit in the South.\n\nSince March, the American Civil Liberties Union and 10 of its local affiliates around the country, 23 Democratic lawmakers and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1700 \u2014 which represents 3,500 Greyhound drivers, mechanics and terminal workers \u2014 have sent letters and a 200,000-signature petition to Greyhound urging the bus line \u201cto stand up for passengers\u201d and require federal border officers who want to board to show probable cause or warrants as a protection against unconstitutional searches and seizures.\n\n\u201cCivil liberties and civil rights groups, along with members of Congress and Greyhound\u2019s own drivers, have urged Greyhound to change its policy. Greyhound\u2019s ongoing conduct is in deliberate disregard for its customers\u2019 rights,\u201d plaintiffs attorney Rachel Jensen said.\n\nThe ACLU said it has documented CBP boardings of buses in Vermont, Calif., Washington state, Arizona and Michigan during which agents tended to focused on people of color or nonnative speakers of English, stating no other reasons for boarding and questioning passengers.\n\nThe publisher Consumer Affairs has reported that passengers receive little or no notice that they can be asked to reveal the contents of their luggage or to show proof of citizenship, and that stops can occur at random and can cause passengers to miss connections.\n\nThe complaint by C\u00f3rdova said immigration officers target Greyhound because its riders are disproportionately nonwhite and low-income, particularly Latino.\n\nThe complaint included several videos, reports and statements by passengers of \u201ccoercive scenes\u201d of armed officers blocking \u201cnarrow bus aisles, singling out passengers of color by hovering over them and accusing many of being \u2018illegal.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe suit was filed by Robbins and Jensen, who was a lead attorney in litigation that resulted in a $25 million settlement for students who alleged fraud by Trump\u2019s defunct real estate seminars, Trump University. Trump did not admit fault in the settlement.\n\nFederal officers\u2019 searches inflict humiliation, discrimination and delays of up to 30 minutes on bus passengers, and searches are being carried out more than 100 miles inside the country, the suit alleged.\n\nLawyers for C\u00f3rdova said her bus was stopped on a highway in California after daybreak as it was en route to Phoenix.\n\nIn its Oct. 19 statement, Greyhound said, \u201cCBP searches have negatively impacted both our customers and our operations,\u201d adding, \u201cWe also encourage all our customers to know their rights and share their opinion on this important issue with their members of Congress.\u201d", "GENEVA \u2014 Christie\u2019s puts under the hammer next week the largest fancy vivid pink diamond that the famed auction house has ever sold, expecting to fetch $30 million to $50 million for the nearly 19-carat, rectangular-cut gemstone.\n\nThe \u201cPink Legacy\u201d will be the standout offering at Christie\u2019s fall jewelry auction in Geneva on Tuesday.\n\nThe stone once belonged to the Oppenheimer diamond family, and Christie\u2019s says it qualifies as a Type IIa diamond \u2014 the most chemically pure stones with little if any nitrogen.

The United States just finished a snarling, bitterly divisive election, and we\u2019re all puzzling over how to interpret the results. President Trump, meanwhile, heads for Paris this weekend to commemorate the armistice of what historian Margaret MacMillan has called \u201cthe war that ended peace.\u201d\n\nI asked some of my historian friends to reflect on the lessons of 1918 for our post-election America. They cited some common themes: the fragility of the world order, then and now; the big, sometimes disastrous outcomes that can begin with small events at the margins; the moral hubris that dooms inflexible leaders to failure; and the humility that allows great leaders to see events through the eyes of adversaries, and thereby avert disaster.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the issue of leadership. Trump in his first two years unfortunately has played the role of divider in chief. He tends to see himself as the victim in every drama, which makes it almost impossible to empathize with critics. When he sees a scab healing over a racial or ethnic wound, he often rips it off. He has turned resentment into a potent national movement.\n\nTrump\u2019s uncompromising style, observes presidential historian Evan Thomas, is weirdly similar to that of Woodrow Wilson, an idealistic Democratic president. Wilson failed to achieve his life\u2019s dream of ratifying the League of Nations treaty because he couldn\u2019t find common ground with his chief adversary, Republican Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge.\n\nIn a recent study of leadership, titled \u201cHistory\u2019s People,\u201d MacMillan writes that great leaders managed \u201cto avoid the trap . . . of thinking that they were always right.\u201d She says of Wilson: \u201cWhen he was convinced, as he often was, of the rightness of his cause, he regarded those who disagreed with him as not just wrong but wicked.\u201d\n\nDoes that sound familiar? Thomas notes that Trump isn\u2019t alone in regarding his political opponents as bad people. These days, he says, \u201ceveryone feels morally superior to everyone else.\u201d Tolerance is traditionally a core American value, but there is an emerging, bifurcated moral intolerance that treats people with different views as enemies.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, let\u2019s look at the midterm elections. The results are a mixed bag, to be sure, but my sense is that America took a collective step back from the brink on Tuesday. The election was largely about Trump\u2019s leadership, and balloting for the House of Representatives \u2014 the broadest measure we have of what the country thinks \u2014 tells us that the nation wants a change from Trump\u2019s style of governing.\n\nThis election was a character test for America, notes Rick Atkinson, whose \u201cLiberation Trilogy\u201d painted an unforgettable portrait of U.S. leadership in World War II in Europe. \u201cYou find yourself hoping for a savior \u2014 someone who will arise and become a statesman. But that\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand. Politics is a collective act, just as war is a collective act.\u201d The only safeguard against catastrophic leadership is sound public judgment.\n\nHistory is a recurring lesson in unintended consequences, argues Kai Bird, a Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer who is now working on a book about President Jimmy Carter. Bird\u2019s fascination with history began with Barbara Tuchman\u2019s \u201cThe Guns of August,\u201d an account of the path to catastrophe in 1914. It\u2019s a saga, explains Bird, of \u201chow generals, kings and presidents stumbled into war \u2014 each side thinking it would be over in a few weeks.\u201d\n\nFor Bird, there\u2019s an eerie sense that \u201cwe\u2019re on a precipice\u201d again because of possible political misjudgments. \u201cAs a historian, I feel things are happening now that may have unintended consequences, especially with a president who is such a lone actor, who may be about to create a constitutional crisis [by firing special counsel Robert S. Mueller III] without knowing where he\u2019s heading.\u201d\n\nDemocracy, in theory, is a self-correcting system. If voters think the country is veering in the wrong direction, they can do something about it \u2014 by electing new leaders and changing course. That seems to be happening. Even with Republican victories in some key Senate and gubernatorial races, the electorate\u2019s unhappiness with Trump seems clear, as it does consistently in opinion polls.\n\nTrump can pretend that he won the midterms and continue on a course that a majority of the country appears to reject. But that would be a march of folly.\n\nRead more from David Ignatius\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley says North Korea canceled this week\u2019s talks between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a senior North Korean official \u2014 but the summit between the two leaders is still on after Jan. 1.\n\nHaley told reporters Thursday \u201cI don\u2019t think there was some major issue\u201d for the postponement.\n\n\u201cI have talked with the administration and basically what we\u2019re looking at is they postponed it because they weren\u2019t ready,\u201d she said, \u201cand secretary Pompeo and the administration stand ready to talk.\u201d\n\nPompeo was supposed to meet Kim Yong Chol in New York Thursday.\n\nHaley spoke ahead of Security Council closed consultations called by Russia to discuss exemptions from U.N. sanctions.\n\nShe stressed that North Korea hasn\u2019t \u201cdone anything to warrant getting rid of the sanctions yet.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Smith had some more harsh words for Washington\u2019s 2-8 NBA team.\n\n\u201cA catastrophe is in the making in Washington, in our nation\u2019s capital, as it pertains to basketball,\u201d Smith said Thursday on \u201cFirst Take.\u201d\n\n\" . . . The situation with John Wall is so bad I\u2019m getting pictures of John Wall off the court, [where] people are seeing him. They\u2019re bringing up Rosebar, one of the most popular nightclubs, if not the most popular nightclub, in Washington, D.C. They\u2019re talking about off-field habits. John Wall, pay attention!\u201d\n\nWall apparently was paying attention. The point guard got wind of Smith\u2019s comments and shared a message for his critics during an Instagram Live session from Orlando, where the Wizards will take on the Magic on Friday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long season, everybody don\u2019t start off great,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep being a fan, I\u2019m gonna keep hooping. If you don\u2019t like it, you can hike it. Facts!\u201d\n\nA commenter asked why Wall, who was chilling in a hot tub, wasn\u2019t in the gym.\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t in the gym because I just left practice \u2018bout an hour or two ago, so now I\u2019m relaxing with my feet up,\u201d Wall said. \u201cBut don\u2019t tell the fans I said that. They think I\u2019m supposed to stay in the gym all day.\u201d\n\nLater, Wall confirmed that he does frequent Rosebar and said he found a meme that\u2019s circulated of him with the nightclub\u2019s logo Photoshopped onto his Wizards jersey \u201cfunny.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do go to Rosebar on Saturdays,\u201d Wall said. \u201cWhat, not supposed to party once in a blue while? The f---? Where you be at, Opera? Living Room?\u201d\n\n(Full disclosure: I initially interpreted the last part of the previous quote as Wall taking a shot at fans who like to relax at the opera or in their living rooms. Then it dawned on me that these are the names of other, apparently inferior, nightclubs in D.C. I get out a lot.)\n\nThe Wizards' defense isn\u2019t the worst in the league because of Wall\u2019s clubbing habits, but this isn\u2019t the first time this year he has defended how he spends his time away from the court.\n\n\u201cYou got a 9-5, what you do after your 9-5?\u201d he said before the season. \u201cYou not about to sit in the house all day are you? I\u2019m a grown man and I can do what I want to. I know what I do and bring to the table, and that\u2019s 110 percent effort. I know how hard I work on my game and I\u2019m going to enjoy my life. I\u2019m not about to sit at home and be boring.\u201d\n\nI look forward to Wall and Smith co-hosting a future event at Rosebar, which couldn\u2019t buy the publicity it received Thursday.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve been to the Rosebar once, but I\u2019m not sure, but I know it\u2019s the hottest nightclub in D.C. I will tell you this, I\u2019m going,\u201d Smith said on \u201cFirst Take.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not apologizing for that, but that\u2019s a different subject for another day.

Bush, said, \u201cI don\u2019t attach any magic to Election Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump has always been impulsive,\u201d Fleischer said. \u201cHe\u2019s always taken abrupt action. He\u2019s always been a from-the-gut, do-it-now executive, for better or worse. So I don\u2019t attribute any strategy, any forethought, any detailed planning to any of it. I think this is Trump being Trump.\u201d\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, Democrats took control of the House by sweeping suburban districts that had been represented by Republicans but where voters repudiated Trump. Republicans are poised to make small gains in the Senate, however, thanks in part to the president\u2019s energetic campaigning in red states that he won overwhelmingly in 2016 and where he remains popular.\n\n[Venting about press, Trump has repeatedly sought to ban reporters over questions]\n\nTrump tried to take a victory lap at news conference Wednesday. When a reporter told him, \u201cLast night was not an absolute victory for you,\u201d the president said he saw it differently.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest,\u201d he replied, \u201cI thought it was very close to complete victory.\u201d\n\nAs Fleischer put it, \u201cDonald Trump is always in salesman mode. His marble countertops are the world\u2019s best countertops. His lobbies are the most beautiful lobbies anywhere. His election nights are the most perfect election nights anybody\u2019s ever had.\u201d\n\nAnother decision that on the surface seemed impulsive was the one by the White House to suspend the press credentials of CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta after his testy exchange with Trump at the news conference.\n\nBut Trump has long vented angrily to aides about what he considers disrespectful behavior and impertinent questions and sought to punish them. He has singled out Acosta, as well as April Ryan of American Urban Radio, among others. As CNN\u2019s chief White House correspondent, Acosta has long infuriated the president and his aides with his line of questioning and comportment.\n\nTrump repeatedly has directed White House staff to ban individual reporters from covering official events or to revoke their press credentials. However, Trump\u2019s senior aides, including White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, had previously convinced him that moves to restrict media access could backfire.\n\nThat changed Wednesday, when the White House for the first time directed the Secret Service to seize a reporter\u2019s \u201chard pass,\u201d which provides access to the White House grounds.\n\nSanders has defended the move and distributed a doctored video that made Acosta\u2019s actions look more aggressive toward a White House intern. The deceptively edited footage was first shared by Paul Joseph Watson, who is known for his conspiracy-theory videos on the far-right website Infowars, which has been banned from Twitter and other social media platforms.\n\n[White House shares doctored video to support punishment of journalist Jim Acosta]\n\n\u201cThis is a unique moment in this administration where the president has thrown down the gauntlet,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe have this dangerous convergence of walking away from the rule of law and walking away from the First Amendment at the same time.\u201d\n\nMichael D\u2019Antonio, a Trump biographer who has studied the president\u2019s behavior in his personal and professional lives, said Trump\u2019s moves this week to oust Sessions and punish Acosta are in keeping with his natural instinct to escalate feuds \u2014 and portend an even more tumultuous period of his presidency.\n\n\u201cHis inclination is annihilation of the enemy,\u201d D\u2019Antonio said. \u201cI think that he\u2019s been dying to increase the power of his salvos against his enemies. He is a person who wants evermore powerful bombs to drop.\u201d\n\nThat may explain a 12:38 a.m. tweet sent Thursday by Preet Bharara, who was fired by Trump as U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York: \u201cWhy am I not sleeping?\u201d", "UPDATE: Paradise \u2018pretty much destroyed\u2019 as wildfire rages in Northern California\n\nA destructive and fast-moving wildfire erupted in Northern California on Thursday morning, spreading rapidly because of mix howling winds and extremely dry conditions.\n\nThe Camp Fire, in Butte County, north of the state\u2019s capital, Sacramento, had burned through some 18,000 acres as of Thursday evening and was 0 percent contained as officials scrambled to evacuate area residents. It had injured an undisclosed number of civilians, and two firefighters, officials said at a news conference on Thursday. Acting governor Gavin Newsom (D), who is filling the role while Gov.

Others flooded Twitter with messages about missing family members. Paradise, Calif., a town of 27,000 that is popular with retirees, has been evacuated, as were the nearby communities of Pulga and Concow. As many as 1,000 structures were reportedly burned in town.\n\n\n\nSmoke from the Camp Fire, burning in the Feather River Canyon near Paradise, Calif., darkens the sky Thursday, as seen from Highway 99 near Marysville, Calif.

By 8:20 a.m., the house was burning.\n\nPercifield left in his pickup truck for an emergency gathering place outside of town, finding himself on an empty road with the fire a swelling inferno on both sides of the road around him. A video he took captures the hellacious conditions he described; thick smoke and heat surrounding the truck as the temperature rose inside, while giant sparks and flames licked the roof over his head in nearly pitch-black darkness. At one point, a tree branch fell on his car, smashing his windshield and denting his hood.\n\nPercifield said that he drove off the road a few times in the low-visibility conditions but eventually made it to a meadow that is maintained for residents to gather in the event of fires. He said that people spoke there about neighbors in Concow who had been unable to escape their homes.\n\nThe fire started in the early hours of the morning near Pulga, a small community surrounded by the Plumas National Forest, officials said. The first firefighters to arrive found about 10-15 acres burning. Wind gusts of nearly 50 miles per hour helped speed its growth.\n\nAnd officials cautioned that the situation could still change rapidly. Cal Fire Chief Darren Read told reporters that an estimated 1,500 first responders were at the scene or en route, as well as 300 fire engines, 20 bulldozers, aircraft and other support vehicles.\n\nAccording to Sacramento Bee reporter Ryan Lillis, some 60 to 70 people were awaiting an emergency evacuation at a Walgreen\u2019s in Paradise.\n\n\u201cFire crews asking for buses to get them out,\u201d he reported. A hospital in town, Adventist Health Feather River, was also evacuated before it caught on fire.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s parent company could not be reached for comment. Evacuation routes were clogged with people attempting to flee the growing blaze, the Sacramento Bee reported, and first responders expressed concern about whether they could escape.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of an area that\u2019s safe right now,\" Lt. Al Smith of the Butte County Sheriff\u2019s Office told the San Francisco Chronicle. More than 30,000 people had been evacuated.\n\nMany people took to social media to register their distress.\n\n\u201cMy mother is trapped with other drivers on Pearson Rd in Paradise with houses burning nearby,\u201d tweeted @jdpiersoniv. \u201cPeople leaving vehicles and running with children and pets.\u201d\n\nMy brother-in-law took these photos as he was evacuating.

Cal Fire officials warned that the blaze could reach the city of Chico, a college town of about 93,000 about six miles from Paradise. The university said it planned to close Friday \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d\n\nAn evacuation order issued by the county extended up to the city\u2019s limits.\n\n\u201cRight now, Mother Nature is in charge,\u201d spokesman Bryce Bennett told the Bee.\n\nSmoke as seen from Chico State campus. #CampFire pic.twitter.com/fyL61xud9g \u2014 Gavin Remme (@gevan32) November 8, 2018\n\nSmoke from the fire had wafted westward to the San Francisco Bay Area, satellite imagery showed, prompting a local air quality warning.\n\nThe National Weather Service had predicted dangerous fire weather conditions in California because of Santa Ana winds, which roar in from the east and accelerate down California\u2019s north-to-south-oriented mountain slopes.\n\nRed-flag warnings for \u201ccritical fire weather conditions\u201d were in effect not only for the Sacramento Valley but also through Central and Southern California. Wind gusts of 50 mph were expected in many locations.\n\nThere were 23.4 million Californians under red-flag warnings Thursday into early Friday, after which the winds are expected to ease, giving responders improving conditions for battling the blaze.\n\nLook at the #CampFire smoke plume from this afternoons pass of the MODIS Satellite. #CAwx pic.twitter.com/b9SETrz3sa \u2014 NWS Sacramento (@NWSSacramento) November 9, 2018\n\nCalifornia has experienced debilitating fires of unprecedented regularity in the past few years. In August, the Mendocino Complex Fire became the largest wildfire ever recorded in the state, eventually burning more than 400,000 acres. The previous record had been set less than a year before in another catastrophic fire that burned through more than 280,000 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. In October 2017, some 21 wildfires burned nearly 95,000 acres and 7,000 buildings in Sonoma and Napa counties in the heart of California\u2019s wine country, killing 40 people.", "Sports columnist\n\nWhere it comes to Zion Williamson, the Duke man-child who helped open the college basketball season with a thunderous debut against Kentucky, there is zero pretense. There are the 31 games of the regular season. There are, perhaps, three games in the ACC tournament. And, should the Blue Devils reach the NCAA championship game, there would be six games deep into March.\n\nForty games \u2014 maybe. Love him and leave him, college hoops fans.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be an outstanding player for us for the one year,\u201d Blue Devils Coach Mike Krzyzewski said before the season opened. \u201cAnd I think he\u2019s going to be \u2014 he has a chance of being, even, an NBA all-star.\u201d\n\nBut what if he never played college basketball at all? What if he and his freshman running mates R.J. Barrett and Cameron Reddish \u2014 not to mention, say, Maryland\u2019s Jalen Smith and North Carolina\u2019s Nassir Little and Oregon\u2019s Bol Bol, among others \u2014 had another option and never went through the farce of enrolling in college to take classes toward a degree they have no intention of receiving four years from now?\n\nCollege basketball is, at the moment, a niche sport. I love it and probably always will. But it undeniably has been shoved to the margins. This past spring, the NCAA tournament selection show, which for years I thought of as a national holiday, received fewer television viewers than at any point in its history. The result of wandering attention spans and expanding options? Consider it was outdrawn by PGA Tour golf (yes, with Tiger in contention), a NASCAR race and a regular season NBA game.\n\nThree weeks later, the national title game between Villanova and Michigan, two name brands with national appeal, drew fewer than 16 million viewers, the lowest total on record.\n\nYes, the move of both the title game and the selection show from old standby CBS to cable\u2019s Turner properties played into the ratings drop. But ask yourself, too: Why was CBS willing to move what\u2019s supposed to be a marquee property to a cable outlet?\n\n[Analysis: College basketball wakes up to the Duke takeover]\n\nTo my mind, college basketball has problems that are deeper than those revealed last month in a Manhattan courtroom. Yeah, a low-rent agent and a couple of Adidas executives were convicted of fraud charges for their roles in the kind of pay-for-play schemes that, darkly, have been part of the sport for decades.\n\nThe people who run the college hoops consider this important because \u2014 if you trust them \u2014 they believe basic faith in the sport has eroded. Cue John Swofford, ACC commissioner, to reporters last month: \u201cIt\u2019s critical to the long-term health of the sport and the health of college athletics that there\u2019s institutional and public confidence in the integrity of the sport.\u201d\n\nIf corruption were indeed the heart of the problem, I would argue the solution is simple: pay the players. The kids aren\u2019t in college to go to college anyway. The money \u2014 that would be $19.6 billion-with-a-B that CBS and Turner paid to carry the NCAA tournament from 2010 to 2032 \u2014 goes now not to the performers but to coaches and administrators and general athletic department bloat.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found that our fans say they would lose interest if the players weren\u2019t amateurs,\u201d Larry Scott, the Pac-12 commissioner, said this fall. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t care as much.\u201d\n\nBut as demonstrated, the interest in college basketball is dissolving, and you can\u2019t convince me that minor league bagmen are the reasons.\n\nThe fact that Williamson and Barrett and others won\u2019t be around at this point next year is far more important. In 2006, the NBA\u2019s new collective bargaining agreement put in place an age limit on players for the draft. As backward as it seems now, that was supposed to help college basketball because even if the most talented players would spend only one year on campus, at least they would arrive.\n\nInstead, those players have done more to define the ensuing drafts than they have to define the college programs they drift through. That initial year of 2006, the first round of the NBA draft included only two freshmen \u2014 and eight college seniors.\n\nBut that\u2019s no longer the case. The NBA pounces on the talent whenever it becomes available. In the past five drafts, 33 college freshmen have been selected in the top 10 \u2014 as opposed to two seniors. The past nine first overall picks have been college freshmen. This year should make that 10 in a row.\n\nDid college basketball benefit because Ben Simmons played at LSU or Deandre Ayton logged 35 games at Arizona? Do you even remember Ben Simmons playing at LSU or Deandre Ayton logging 35 games at Arizona? There\u2019s no way to become attached to these drifters. You might have hated former Duke guard Grayson Allen \u2014 many did. But after four seasons, 142 career games, an NCAA title and the occasional trip of an opponent, at least there was a relationship there. At least you cared.\n\n[Why did No. 3 Oregon women\u2019s basketball tip off at Alaska? To salute Ruthy Hebard\u2019s journey.]\n\nThe NBA is thinking about altering this math and giving 18-year-old players another option. Prefer to get paid for your marketable skills immediately upon graduation from high school? (What a concept!) Then the developmental G-League would have a place for you. The proposed contracts would be for $125,000 annually. (Which leads to an easy joke: \u201cWell, I could make more at Louisville.\u201d)\n\nMight a Zion Williamson or an R.J. Barrett decide to earn six figures rather than spending a year at Duke? Maybe not for $125,000 flat. But because they would be pros, they would be able to sell Gatorade or have their own shoe or receive aboveboard money from a car dealer or what have you. The gateway to the NBA marketing life would be open a year earlier.\n\nWould college miss either of them? Eh. Kevin Garnett would have been a college freshman in 1995-96. Kobe Bryant would have matriculated the following year. Those two seasons, Kentucky won the NCAA title with rosters featuring Tony Delk and Antoine Walker and Ron Mercer and on and on. Wildcats fans could identify with those players and those teams because they watched them develop over years, not months. Yes, there were still one-and-dones then. But the obvious ones \u2014 Garnett and Bryant among them \u2014 never showed up.\n\nSo as college basketball gets going, interest may be high in Chapel Hill and Lexington, Bloomington and Lawrence and the like, but the rest of the country is waiting for three weeks in March. The problem isn\u2019t the talent level of the players or whether someone slipped them an envelope during a summer league event. The problem is by the time we learn who they are enough to care, they\u2019re gone, and we have to start over the next November.\n\nFor more by Barry Svrluga, visit washingtonpost.com/svrluga.", "\n\nAlex Smith and the Redskins are 0-3 when their opponent scores first this season. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nFor the Redskins and their opponents, every lead has been safe this season. In its five wins, Washington has scored first and never trailed. In its three losses, Washington has allowed the game\u2019s first points and never led. Through nine weeks, the Redskins are the only team in the NFL that has yet to experience a lead change.\n\n\u201cYou can probably count on one hand how many comeback wins we\u2019ve had since I\u2019ve been here,\u201d Redskins Coach Jay Gruden said Wednesday when asked about his team\u2019s struggles when playing from behind.\n\nIt actually takes three hands to count the Redskins' 15 wins in the 54 games in which they\u2019ve trailed at any point during Gruden\u2019s tenure, which began in 2014. But that number still puts Washington in some unflattering company. As Howard Fendrich of the Associated Press noted this week, the only teams with fewer come-from-behind wins during that span are the Colts (14), Bears (13), Giants (13), Jaguars (10) and Browns (nine). Fendrich also reported that, since the start of the 2014 season, the 2017 Browns and 2017 Giants are the only teams to go an entire season without winning a game they trailed. Those teams finished 0-16 and 3-13. Under Gruden, the Redskins are 25-14-1 when scoring first and 8-24 when their opponent scores first.\n\nFox\u2019s broadcast team mentioned the Redskins' lack of lead changes during Washington\u2019s win over the Giants in Week 8.

There\u2019s no easy way to search for lead changes on Pro Football Reference, but by my count, after perusing the box scores of every regular season game this season through Thursday, there have been 136 lead changes in 135 games. The Saints have experienced a league-high 18 lead changes, including eight in their 43-37, overtime win at the Falcons in Week 3. The Jaguars witnessed their first (and thus far only) lead change in a Week 8 loss to the Eagles in London. Every other team, except the Redskins, has been involved in at least four lead changes.\n\n(Worth noting: The first score in every Redskins game this season has been a touchdown.)\n\nAccording to the NFL Media Research Department, via NFL Network reporter Gregg Rosenthal, the Redskins are the fourth team since 1970 to not have a lead change in their first eight games. The 1995 Packers went the longest without a lead change to open a season since the NFL-AFL merger, with their first lead change occurring in their ninth game in Week 10. Green Bay went 11-5 that season and lost in the NFC championship game.\n\nShould the Redskins take an early lead Sunday at Tampa Bay, they\u2019ll look to keep their odd streak alive.

High Commissioner for Refugees. (Alfredo Estrella/AFP)\n\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 For most of the migrants here, the U.S. midterm elections were a vague rumor, a fragment of information that circulated without meaning. When the results came in Tuesday, the migrants were splayed out in white plastic tents in an aging Olympic stadium, after about a thousand miles on the road. They slept or watched cartoons on a giant screen.\n\nIf this week\u2019s vote was indeed the \u201celection of the caravan,\u201d as President Trump said, no one had bothered to tell the people in the caravan.\n\nTheir journey never had anything to do with the U.S. elections, and the proof of that is apparent now, as the migrants continue north, as unaware of American politics as they were two weeks ago.\n\nWhat happened to the caravan after the midterm elections? The same thing that happened each day before. Early Wednesday and Thursday, thousands of migrants awoke here and planned the journey ahead. They fed their children. They smoked cigarettes. They prayed.\n\n\u201cThere was a rumor going around that Donald Trump had supposedly lost, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true. I do know that there was an election,\u201d said Avel Antonio Mejia, 21, from Ocotepeque, Honduras. \u201cMany times other people pass on news by word of mouth, but we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or false.\"\n\nMost of the migrants here were unaware of the rumors that the caravan\u2019s very existence \u2014 their own journey \u2014 was a political stunt. Those tweets and news stories were posted while they walked through northern Guatemala and southern Mexico, many without phones or Internet access.\n\nHow the world will consider the caravan now, after the U.S. elections, is a different question. The U.S. military inexplicably changed the name of its deployment on the border from \u201cOperation Faithful Patriot\u201d to simply \u201cborder support.\u201d The number of people typing \u201ccaravan\u201d into Google is crashing.

Americans were sure that the news coverage had slowed.\n\n\u201cStrange that the media isn\u2019t all over the caravan story anymore,\u201d tweeted Ben Rhodes, a former aide to President Barack Obama.\n\nOn Thursday, many reporters were in the stadium with the migrants, another aspect of their journey to which the travelers had become accustomed. They had been interviewed and photographed. They had been videotaped by journalists with cameras, and by drone and iPhone. But they rarely saw where those images were published, or the words that accompanied them, like Fox News' banner headline, \u201cCould Caravan be Bringing Unknown Diseases?\u201d\n\nMejia said he had been interviewed seven times since entering Guatemala from Honduras.\n\nKellyn Godoy Hern\u00e1ndez, 24, from Valle, Honduras, watched as groups of men lined up to grab spare pairs of donated jeans from a row of cardboard boxes. She had heard the same rumor, that President Trump had lost the election.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I\u2019m relieved because we know that he\u2019s been denying us entry,\u201d she said.\n\nBut she was uncertain about the accuracy of the news, which was circulating among migrants in the tents set up to distribute food. Her Samsung phone had been ruined in the rain, so she had no way to check the rumor on her own.\n\nJonny Alexander Portillo, 24, and his cousin, Gerlin Josu\u00e9 Maldonado, 19, leaned against a jacaranda tree outside the stadium Thursday afternoon. They had heard that there would be elections in the United States, and that if one party won, it could be favorable for the remainder of their journey. But they still had not heard about the election results.\n\nEleven migrants had traveled together, from farmlands in Ocotepeque, and they were not about to turn back.\n\n\u201cWe had heard that this was the first of two elections \u2014 and if one group won, it would make our situation better.

He accused lawmakers of using delaying tactics to waste time.\n\n\u201cTo both houses, elections are a threat that must be resisted at all costs, but to the citizens, elections are a means of liberation from the ineffective and increasingly illegitimate authorities,\u201d Salame told the Security Council. \u201cAccording to our latest poll, which I received this morning, 80 percent of Libyans insist on having elections.\u201d\n\nThe U.N. special envoy said the time has come for a wider group of Libyans to meet \u201cto devise a clean path out of the present impasse, reinforced by a clear timetable.\u201d And he said he backs plans by this more representative group of Libyans to move forward with a National Conference in the first weeks of 2019.\n\n\u201cThe subsequent electoral process should commence in the spring of 2019,\u201d Salame added.\n\nLibya plunged into chaos after the 2011 uprising that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi and is now governed by rival administrations in the east and west. It has also become a haven for armed groups, including several from neighboring countries, which survive on looting and human trafficking.\n\nSalame said the U.N. is now aiming to consolidate a cease-fire in Tripoli that it brokered in September \u201con the ground and at a political level.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe violence in September reflects the underlying fragility in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Libyan conflict is in large part a conflict over resources, and until this is resolved, stability will remain elusive.\u201d\n\nLibya is a major oil producer, with production reaching up to 1.3 million barrels a day, providing the country of 6.5 million people revenues of over $13 billion in the first half of 2018, Salame said.\n\n\u201cHowever, these figures obfuscate the truth: Libyans have been increasingly impoverished while criminals employ violence and patronage networks to steal billions from the national coffers,\u201d he said.\n\nIronically, Salame said, the violence in Tripoli provided an opportunity to introduce long-needed economic reforms on Sept. 12, including the imposition of fees on foreign currency transactions which caused an almost 25 percent drop in the black-market exchange rate.\n\nThis has dropped prices for basic goods such as sugar, bread, school supplies and second-hand cars, he said, and the liquidity crisis is shrinking and lines outside banks are shrinking.\n\nSalame said there is now \u201ca window of opportunity to address the tremendous challenges Libyan security institutions have faced since 2011,\u201d and he urged participants at the upcoming conference on Libya in Palermo, Italy \u201cto offer tangible support to the training of professional security forces.\u201d\n\nThe U.N. envoy also called for contributions \u201cto unify and restructure a professional, national army.\u201d And he said the conference can also provide practical support \u201cto establish a system for redistribution of national wealth, not to the benefit of overnight millionaires, but for the whole population.\u201d\n\nSalame also warned the Security Council that the situation in southern Libya \u201cis becoming even more precarious\u201d with \u201crising criminality and terrorism, rampant lawlessness,\u201d and \u201cthreats to the oil fields and the water infrastructure upon which the nation relies.\u201d\n\nHe urged U.N. member states to support Libyan authorities to address the threat from the presence of al-Qaida and Islamic State extremists and other terrorist groups across the south of Libya.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nIt now looks like the Democratic victory was bigger than we first thought: Democrats may win upwards of 35 House seats, and according to Nate Cohn\u2019s projections, they are on track to win the national House popular vote by seven to eight points, roughly their margin in the wave of 2006, and slightly larger than the Republican margin in 2010.\n\nRepublicans, to be sure, won far more seats that year. But Democrats won fewer seats this time because of structural disadvantages such as gerrymandering and the concentration of Democratic voters in urban centers. As Cohn explains, the amount of seats they did win in the face of those hurdles actually demonstrates how well the party performed. This was, Cohn notes, a \u201cwave.\u201d\n\nWhich gives rise to a question: What does all this mean for 2020?\n\nOne of the biggest stories of the election was the big shift to Democrats among college-educated whites, a marginally Republican-leaning constituency that has been badly alienated by President Trump.\n\nA new analysis from CNN\u2019s Ron Brownstein sheds light on just how big that movement was \u2014 and on what that might mean for Trump\u2019s reelection chances. As Brownstein notes, the election further polarized the two coalitions, between the GOP coalition made up of blue-collar, small-town, rural, exurban, aging and evangelical Christian whites, and the Democratic one comprised of young voters, nonwhites and college-educated white and suburban voters, particularly women.\n\nDemocrats won House seats not only in cities and suburbs of big metropolitan areas that already lean blue. They also picked off seats in more Republican-leaning suburban areas, around places such as Richmond, Dallas, Houston, Des Moines, Kansas City, Oklahoma City, and Charleston, S.C.\n\nThese are places, Brownstein notes, where \u201cRepublicans had, until now, resisted the general movement of white-collar communities toward the Democrats.\u201d But the Democrats\u2019 House gains in these areas were fueled by the defection of college-educated whites to their party, which happened even as non-college-educated whites delivered the Republican Party their gains in the Senate, in white, more blue-collar red states:\n\nExit polls \u2026 found that just 40 percent of college-educated white voters said they approved of Trump\u2019s job performance, while 59 percent disapproved. The numbers were essentially inverted among white voters without a college education: 61 percent approved while just 39 percent disapproved. Driven by those divergent reactions to the president, non-college educated whites gave Republicans a resounding 24 percentage point advantage in House races, according to the exit poll. College-educated voters preferred Democrats by eight points, the poll found. That was a huge shift from both 2014 and 2010 midterm elections, when Republicans won them by margins of at least sixteen percentage points.\n\nThe result is that the new Republican-minority House caucus is mostly concentrated in blue-collar, white and rural and small-town districts. By contrast, the new Democratic-majority House caucus is more diverse, and importantly, more affluent and more educated. Note this stat on the incoming class of House Democrats:\n\nThree-fifths hold seats where the median income is greater than the national average, and just under three-fifths hold districts with more college graduates than average.\n\nThis is due to the infusion of college-educated and suburban whites, some from affluent white-collar suburbs, into the Democratic coalition.\n\nAmong the big questions this raises: Is a new version of the Democratic coalition of young voters, minorities, and educated, socially liberal, secular whites emerging that is particular to the Trump governing era \u2014 one that didn\u2019t quite deliver for Democrats in 2016 but is now more energized and cohered in reaction to Trump\u2019s governance? Can that hold together, given some of the strains that may arise around differing economic priorities among these groups?\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not saying this coalition necessarily can deliver a victory in the electoral college, which imposes new complications on the equation. The heavy blue-collar-white concentrations in the industrial Midwestern states that Democrats need to win require them to hold down Republican margins among that demographic. It is notable in this regard that Democrats won all six Senate and gubernatorial contests in the three \u201cblue wall\u201d states Trump cracked \u2014 Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. But as Alec MacGillis points out, Democrats did terribly in Ohio (with the exception of Sherrod Brown), suggesting that maybe it\u2019s drifting in a redder and redder direction. That, plus Democratic losses in Florida, offer pause.\n\nThe flip side of this big polarization among white voters is that, by further energizing blue-collar whites, Republicans built on their Senate majority. As Adam Serwer points out, given the relentless xenophobic and race-baiting messaging employed to make that happen, it\u2019s clear there is a fundamental difference between the two coalitions: The GOP one is at least to some extent organized around discomfort with evolving, multi-racial America, while the Democratic one, the one that wrought a new House majority, is evolving, multiracial America.\n\nIn other words, something big and important did happen in this election, despite the punditry that strains mightily to find ways of minimizing the Dem victory: A multi-racial majority coalition, one fueled by historically enormous turnout, did rise up in reaction to Trumpian governance to decisively and emphatically put in place a new check on his rule in the form of a Democratic House. And it may be prompting a realignment.\n\nThis was in part driven by college-educated-white revulsion at Trump\u2019s racist and misogynist provocations and his ethno-nationalist agenda. But it\u2019s also important to note that the Trump-era GOP agenda joins those things with orthodox GOP economics, and the latter\u2019s utter failure to offer answers on health care surely also helped drive college-educated whites to Democrats. In other words, that demographic likely rejected the Trump-era GOP agenda\u2019s fusion of ethno-nationalist cruelty and regressive plutocracy.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this House majority coalition will hold, and whether it is enough to form at least the underpinnings of an effort to defeat Trump in 2020. But this did constitute a big victory, whose significance we are only beginning to appreciate.", "\n\nA cyclist pedals along R Street NW.

Entrepreneurs from the United States\u2019 agricultural sector have arrived in Cuba to promote business between the two countries. (Desmond Boylan/Associated Press)\n\nHAVANA \u2014 Representatives from the United States\u2019 agricultural sector arrived in Cuba on Thursday for a conference aimed at promoting sales, one of the few U.S. business areas allowed to deal with the island under a half-century-old trade embargo that Cuban leaders blame for most of its economic troubles.\n\nThe U.S.-Cuba Agriculture Coalition will explore potential opportunities for American agriculture producers seeking a market on the island. Cuba imports most of its food products from abroad, a multibillion-dollar market that has flourished despite U.S. sanctions.\n\nRelations between both countries normalized somewhat after former U.S. President Barack Obama loosened the trade embargo while in office. But President Donald Trump has intensified sanctions, making it harder for Americans to travel to Cuba and conduct business.\n\nIn 2017, the United States sold $260 million of food to the Cuba, but the figure was one of the lowest in this decade and paled in comparison to the $450 million of U.S. food sold in 2012.\n\nThe island still cannot sell its own products in the U.S. and is not given credit to help pay for imports as a result of the embargo.\n\nCuba spends about $2 billion a year to import food for its 11 million citizens, who are given almost free rations each month of products such as chicken, rice and milk.\n\nPhil Peters, a trip organizer, said U.S. agribusiness is interested in exporting more products to Cuba and improving regulatory conditions, and in \u201cbuilding a broader and more normal relationship in which there is investment and shared business.\u201d\n\nAbout 30 participants were meeting with officials at the conference and visiting farms and cooperatives in the Caribbean nation. The group is scheduled to stay until Saturday.\n\n\u201cOur country finds itself fully updating its economic model,\u201d Cuban deputy agriculture minister Jose Miguel Rodriguez de Armas said at the opening of the conference. \u201cThe concerns of the agriculture sector are very important for the development of our country.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(RMG News/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nRon Helus, a sergeant in the Ventura County (Calif.) Sheriff\u2019s Office, was fatally shot during a mass shooting on Wednesday. Police officers Daniel Mead, Michael Smidga, Anthony Burke and Timothy Matson were wounded by gunfire at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh on Oct. 27. Charleston Hartfield, an off-duty police officer and an Army veteran, was murdered in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, 2017, while trying to protect music-festival attendees from Stephen Paddock\u2019s rampage. Officer Nicholas Koahou was wounded by gunfire during the Dec. 2, 2015, terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif.\n\nThis is the tally of \u201cgood guys,\u201d some of them carrying guns, who were killed and wounded in the deadliest mass shootings to take place in the past three years. Politicians love to invoke the \u201cgood guy with a gun\u201d who is supposed to be the super-heroic solution to mass shootings. Just last month, President Trump declared that \u201cif there was an armed guard inside the temple, they would have been able to stop\u201d the synagogue shooting. The trope is a politically convenient alternative to gun control, obscuring the very real risks that armed criminals pose to the people who are already supposed to be our good guys with guns: law enforcement officers.\n\nElected officials should be ashamed of hiding their inaction behind this vapid slogan. The industry that\u2019s profited off this image for decades should feel ashamed, too. The entertainment industry has played an enormous role in promoting the idea of the invulnerable action-hero cop, to the detriment of civilians and police officers.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, when I set out to explore how Hollywood had portrayed policing over the last 100 years, one of the first things I noticed was stark changes in the way the entertainment industry handled stories in which the police used their guns.\n\nInitially, shows such as \u201cDragnet\u201d and \u201cNaked City\u201d portrayed such incidents as rare and deeply regrettable. Fictional cops such as Joe Friday (Jack Webb) and Jimmy Halloran (James Franciscus) were profoundly grieved when they shot and killed criminals. While these shows inevitably vindicated the officers\u2019 decision-making, they still suggested that the circumstances in which such shootings happened represented an unusual and serious breakdown of the normal order. Cops weren\u2019t supposed to face deadly violence on a regular basis, and neither were they expected to routinely charge into life-or-death situations, guns blazing.\n\nThese assumptions did not last, worn down by the crime wave that began in the 1960s, and later, when the crime rate declined, the demands of Hollywood\u2019s relentless appetite for blockbusters.\n\nIn movies such as \u201cLethal Weapon\u201d and \u201cDie Hard,\u201d cops such as Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and John McClane (Bruce Willis) were pitted against increasingly violent antagonists. Facing off against hyper-violent drug dealers or brilliant and murderous thieves, these fictional cops could dispense with the hand-wringing about whether it was wrong to kill their antagonists. And the iron law of franchise-making meant that, while these cops might get bloodied and smoke-stained, or even pick glass out of their bare feet, they would never be in mortal peril. If our heroes were to be killed or disabled in the line of duty, what would become of Hollywood\u2019s precious sequels?\n\nIn the real world, there are no action coordinators designing mass shootings to ensure that only dispensable extras are killed and that bullets always whiz past our heroes. Shootouts between suspects and the police may be entertaining on screen; they are shattering in real life.\n\nBecoming a cop gets you a badge, a gun and training in how to use it, but it does not guarantee that you will be the superior marksman in an armed confrontation, or have superior firepower at your disposal. (The same risks apply to civilian who imagine that they might step up and become heroic good guys with guns if given the chance.) Police departments know this. The International Association of Chiefs of Police earlier this year backed efforts to ban bump stocks and other accessories that can be used to turn semiautomatic weapons into automatic ones on the grounds that \u201caddressing the threat posed by these devices will assist in our efforts to make communities safer and protect the lives of both citizens and law enforcement officers.\u201d\n\nThis fantasy of the police officer \u2014 or any armed civilian \u2014 as an unkillable one-man army is a fairy story that asks individual cops to shoulder increasingly deadly risks on our behalf and without the protection of collective efforts to keep us all safer. Promoting the \u201cgood guy with a gun\u201d as a solution to our mass shooting nightmare will not give us fewer or less deadly mass shootings, but it may well produce more martyred cops, sacrificed on the altar of our political stalemate. Politicians should stop telling this lie. Hollywood should reconsider making a profit off it.\n\nRead more:\n\nThis is how we save lives from gun violence\n\nThe Thousand Oaks massacre is more evidence the U.S. needs effective gun control now", "\n\nFox personality Tucker Carlson speaks at the Business Insider Ignition: Future of Media conference in New York on Nov. 30.

Nor does it come from President Trump, whatever his flaws,\u201d said [Carlson in the segment]. \u201cThe threat today comes from the progressive left and its growing enthusiasm for force as a political tool.\u201d Thereupon Carlson cited Teen Vogue writer Lauren Duca for tweeting something objectionable; people menacing Republican lawmakers; and Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters (Calif.) for \u201ccelebrating racial violence during the L.A. riots\u201d; and a progressive activist who previously appeared on Carlson\u2019s show and failed to denounce violence to Carlson\u2019s standards.\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty weak list. It gathers strength, however, from the threats chanted Wednesday night at Carlson\u2019s residence. According to a police report, \u201cIt was discovered that unknown persons spray painted an anarchy symbol on the driveway.\u201d The report also cites \u201cSuspected Hate Crime\u201d with \u201cAnti-Political\u201d motivation.\n\nIf the goal is to stop Tucker Carlson, these tactics will ensure the opposite result. Fox News has thrived for years by hyping news stories about lefty protesters who overstep boundaries in expressing their views. Vandalism in the form of anarchy symbols is a valued visual at the network. By seizing on such stuff, Fox News has become Fox News, a place where top management can say goodbye to King of Cable News Bill O\u2019Reilly and promote Tucker Carlson while maintaining its ratings preeminence.\n\nAngelo Carusone, president of Media Matters for America, was instrumental in the toppling of Beck and O\u2019Reilly. The scare tactics against Carlson, he said, are \u201cobviously not okay.\u201d \u201cThe intention was intimidation,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t support that. It\u2019s not just not a good idea. It\u2019s a kind of escalation that\u2019s needless.\u201d A better approach, Carusone said, is to view Carlson as a \u201cbusiness\u201d who relies on advertisers, shareholders and cable subscribers to do his thing.\n\nRead more:\n\nDavid Von Drehle: Someone tell Tucker Carlson what \u2018E pluribus unum\u2019 really means\n\nKathleen Parker: A caller threatened to shoot up CNN.

(Stringer/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe Trump administration is considering designating Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels a terrorist organization, people familiar with the discussions said, as part of a campaign to end that country\u2019s civil war and put pressure on the Houthis\u2019 ally Iran.\n\nThe terrorist designation, which would inject an unpredictable new element into fragile diplomatic efforts to initiate peace talks, has been discussed periodically since at least 2016, according to several of the individuals. But the matter has received renewed examination in recent months as the White House seeks to stake out a tough stance on Iranian-linked groups across the Middle East, they said.\n\nA formal terrorist designation by the State Department could further isolate the rebels, members of a minority Shiite Muslim sect who seized control of Yemen\u2019s capital in late 2014, but critics warn that such a move might also worsen already dire humanitarian conditions without pushing the conflict closer to a conclusion.\n\nThe individuals, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations, said the administration has considered an array of potential actions, including lesser measures to punish the rebels, but they said no decision had been made. It was not immediately clear how far deliberations about the terrorist designation, which would be made by the State Department, had progressed.\n\nThe rise of the Houthi movement, which has received military backing from Iran, has sparked an extended military operation by Persian Gulf nations that fear the expansion of Tehran\u2019s reach on the Arabian Peninsula. Since 2015, jets from a Saudi-led coalition have bombed Houthi-controlled areas while allied ground forces have attacked rebel positions.\n\nThe war has also drawn the United States into a conflict with few clear American interests, generating criticism from U.S. lawmakers who disapprove of American involvement in the war. The Pentagon provides aerial refueling to gulf planes as they conduct missions over Yemen and also shares intelligence with coalition militaries.\n\n[Hundreds of thousands of Yemenis trapped as fighting escalates in strategic port city]\n\nOpposition to U.S. help for the Saudi-led gulf coalition fighting in Yemen has grown because of repeated coalition strikes on Yemeni civilians and, separately, the killing in Istanbul of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi national and critic of the Saudi monarchy, by a team dispatched from Riyadh.\n\nThe war has also triggered a massive humanitarian crisis in what was already the poorest country in the Middle East. Last month, the United Nations intensified its warnings about the situation in Yemen, saying that half the population was facing pre-famine conditions.\n\nConsideration of new steps against the Houthis occurs as Western diplomats step up calls for the group to hold talks with the Yemeni government, which has international backing but little influence on the ground.\n\nLast week, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for a halt to fighting in Yemen, even as forces backed by the gulf coalition move closer to a long-awaited assault on the strategic port city of Hodeida, which the Houthis control.\n\nSome U.S. officials, particularly at the State Department, have resisted moves to designate the Houthis a terrorist group, believing that such a designation might complicate U.N. negotiators\u2019 efforts to get peace discussions off the ground. A terrorist designation would be seen as a major escalation of U.S. pressure against the group.\n\nThe U.N. special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths of Britain, hopes to bring the Yemeni parties together by the end of the year. His last attempt, this fall, failed when the rebels refused to travel to Europe for a planned meeting unless certain conditions were met.\n\nA designation would be likely to result in the freezing of financial assets of the Houthi movement, which controls government institutions in areas it occupies. Travel prohibitions and other penalties would also be imposed against those thought to be providing \u201cmaterial support\u201d to the group.\n\nJason Blazakis, who previously oversaw the State Department office on terrorism designations, said such a move against the Houthis would be mostly symbolic. The rebels do not use the international financial system, and few Houthi figures would be affected by a ban on travel to the United States.\n\nThe designation would, however, allow the U.S. government to prosecute individuals believed to be aiding the group, Blazakis said, who is now a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey.\n\nTypically, organizations that the State Department designates terrorist groups have a history of actions seen as threatening to U.S. national security. Designated groups include al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is active in Yemen, and branches of the Islamic State.\n\nIn October 2016, the U.S. military fired Tomahawk cruise missiles at coastal radar sites in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen after missile attacks on U.S. Navy ships in the area.\n\n[U.S. says the time to end the Saudi-backed war in Yemen is now]\n\nThe Houthis are also blamed for attacks on vessels of the Saudi-led coalition and commercial vessels transiting waters off Yemen.\n\nThe 2016 attack on U.S. ships prompted a similar discussion within the Obama administration, but officials decided at that time not to pursue the designation.\n\nIn recent months, Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton have outlined a more muscular policy on Iran designed to halt its support for proxy groups across the region. This month, the administration renewed energy and other sanctions that were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, from which President Trump withdrew the United States this year.\n\nU.S. officials say Iran has provided advanced military technology to the Houthis but has closer ties to other organizations, such as Lebanese Hezbollah.\n\nDesignation of the Houthis as a terrorist group would be welcomed by Saudi Arabia, which took a similar step in 2014. The United States has continued its involvement in the war in Yemen largely because of its desire to support Riyadh, a close economic and counterterrorism ally that has been targeted repeatedly by Houthi-fired missiles.\n\nAid groups fear a designation could worsen suffering among Yemeni civilians because it could require groups to obtain licenses from the U.S. government before they were able to continue their work in Houthi-controlled areas. Already, millions of Yemenis are unable to obtain food and medicine as the conflict stymies trade and creates a surge in preventable diseases.\n\nOfficials said the Trump administration is also examining other steps, short of a terrorist designation, that the United States could take to sanction the Houthis. In 2015, the Obama administration placed individual sanctions on the group\u2019s leader.\n\nThis spring, the Trump administration sanctioned five Iranians who it alleged had helped the Houthis acquire or use ballistic missiles.\n\nKareem Fahim in Istanbul, and John Hudson, Karen DeYoung and Julie Tate in Washington contributed to this report.", "\n\nDemocrat Lucy McBath speaks during a rally on Nov. 2 at Morehouse College in Atlanta. (Alyssa Pointer/Atlanta Journal-Constitution/AP)\n\nAfter 17 students and staff members were slain in hallways and classrooms at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., earlier this year, the surviving students spurred a groundswell of activism. Nationwide, Americans marched in the streets, declaring they were through tolerating the massacre of innocent people in schools, churches, nightclubs, movie theaters and concerts. And they promised that come November, they\u2019d be sending politicians that message.\n\nBetween the Parkland shooting and now, 10 people were killed in another high school in Texas, 11 Jewish people in a synagogue in Pittsburgh and then late Wednesday night 12 people, probably college students, in a bar in California. And those are just high-fatality mass shootings. It doesn\u2019t include the five journalists killed in their newsroom in Annapolis or the shooting in the middle of a yoga class less than a week ago \u2014 which won\u2019t make any lists because of the seven victims, only two women died.\n\nThis has become the tragic norm in the United States.\n\n[The frequency of high-fatality mass shootings has increased significantly]\n\nBut something does seem to have shifted Tuesday night.\n\nYes, the Parkland activists were disappointed that pro-gun rights candidates won statewide in their home state (though the Florida governor and Senate races are now headed for a recount), but around the country candidates who ran unapologetically on a gun-control message scored huge victories.\n\nInstead of shying away from the guns issue for fear of the powerful pull of the National Rifle Association, Democrats put it front and center in their campaigns. Especially in the suburbs \u2014 where Democrats saw huge gains Tuesday night \u2014 anti-gun-violence groups spent millions, collectively investing more in federal races than the NRA.\n\nAnd Thursday, as news of another mass shooting settled in, Democrat Lucy McBath, a gun-control advocate who lost her son in a fatal shooting in 2012, sealed her victory in a Georgia House district once held by Newt Gingrich. McBath, who was inspired to run after Parkland, ran on her personal story.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunately not surprising that on the very same day I officially became a congresswoman-elect, other families in this country are receiving the same exact call that I did six years ago when I learned my son had been murdered,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cAs a congresswoman, but more importantly as a mother, I pledge to do every thing I can to make our communities safer.\u201d\n\nIn another win for gun-control advocates, Democrat Jason Crow beat incumbent Rep. Mike Coffman (R) in a Colorado district that includes Aurora, the Denver suburb where 12 people were killed in a movie theater in 2012, not far from Columbine High School. Crow, a U.S. Army Ranger veteran, told The Washington Post last week: \u201cThe convention in swing districts like this is, don\u2019t take it on, not in a purple or light blue district. It\u2019s a wedge issue. But I believe the danger is in not taking this on anymore.\u201d\n\nAnother notable win was Jennifer Wexton, the Democrat who crushed incumbent Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) in Virginia, where gun policy was a huge dividing line between the candidates.\n\nWith the dramatic increase in mass gun violence, public opinion on guns policy has shifted significantly in recent years. While Americans are about evenly split on banning assault weapons, a whopping 92 percent say there should be background checks on all gun sales, according to Gallup polling.\n\nThe Democrats winning the House is also a major boon for gun-control advocates, who will now push their candidates to take up anti-gun-violence legislation. While it will go nowhere in a GOP-led Senate and with President Trump in the White House, it will give the issue a major edge in the 2020 presidential campaign if House Democrats push it.\n\nAnd there\u2019s past precedent for bipartisan action. Following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, in which 20 6- and 7-year-olds were murdered, several Republicans voted in favor of making incremental changes to gun laws, such as background checks. It was narrowly defeated but suggested there is room for compromise.\n\nThe Senate map for 2020 is not as friendly for Republicans as it was this year. Sens. Susan Collins in Maine and Cory Gardner in Colorado and even Thom Tillis in North Carolina may not want to go up against the powerful gun-control lobby.", "Reporter\n\nRating:\n\n\u201cBunty, the baby nifflers are loose again.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, the hero of \u201cFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\u201d signals to his housekeeper \u2014 and to the audience, really \u2014 that this new chapter in the adventures of magizoologist Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne, as mumbly and bumbly as ever) will have at least one antic chase scene featuring CGI critters.\n\n(Nifflers, which resemble platypuses, are the ewoks of the 21st century.

One of them plays a significant role.)\n\nBut there\u2019s something \u2014 or, rather, someone \u2014 far less adorable that has also escaped in this Harry Potter prequel, which takes a turn for the dark side that will satisfy the franchise\u2019s adult fans even more. As the film opens, in a bravura, wham-bam prologue that combines action with shivery terror, the title character, an evil wizard played by Johnny Depp, is seen escaping from detention while being transferred from a New York prison to face punishment for unspecified crimes in Europe.\n\nWhat crimes? Possibly his haircut: a peroxide-blond brush cut that makes Depp look like a scoutmaster for the local chapter of the Hitler Youth. More seriously, he wants power.\n\n[Here are the 12 movies you should see this holiday season]\n\n\n\nThis platypus-like niffler figures prominently in \u201cFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.\u201d (Warner Bros.

Why doesn\u2019t Dumbledore, one of the most powerful wizards who ever lived, go after Grindelwald himself? Ahh, you\u2019ll just have to wait to find out.\n\nNewt is aided in this mission by sidekicks returning from the 2016 \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\u201d: baker Jacob Kowalski and magical sisters Queenie and Porpentina \u2014 known as Tina \u2014 Goldstein (Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol and Katherine Waterston). J.K Rowling, who wrote this surprise-filled screenplay for veteran Potter director David Yates, has a real knack for names. The film\u2019s other key character, also returning from the previous film, is a young man named Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller).\n\nAs we learned in the previous installment, Credence is an Obscurial (a wizard who has repressed his magical abilities, which, in his case, have manifested themselves in the form of an Obscurus: a dark, uncontrollably destructive entity). Rowling is also quite clever with subtext, the Obscurus being a wonderful metaphor for the unhealthy neurosis that can develop when you deny your true self. There are also political overtones here \u2014 as there have been in every other Potter book and film \u2014 in the hostility and persecution that exists between Wizards and the non-magical Muggles, also known as No-Majs. That polarization is a metaphor for the modern world if ever there were one.\n\n\n\nJohnny Depp plays the evil-Wizard villain Gellert Grindelwald in this prequel to the Harry Potter stories. (Warner Bros. Pictures)\n\nCredence is being pursued by Newt, who wants to neutralize the power of the Obscurus, and by Grindelwald, who wants to harness it to suppress the No-Majs. That battle forms the crux of the film, around which all else revolves, including romantic subplots involving Jacob, Queenie, Tina and Leta Lestrange (Zo\u00eb Kravitz).\n\nCredence, for his part, is also on a hunt. An apparent orphan who was raised by No-Majs, he wants to discover his true identity. And boy, will he. \u201cThe Crimes of Grindelwald\u201d has one of the biggest third-act reveals in the whole Harry Potter series.\n\nAll of this serves a greater purpose, the fullness of which will be revealed only over the course of the next three planned films. One other thing that Rowling is good at: planning. \u201cGrindelwald\u2019s\u201d story, set in 1927, may be all about nifflers and wizards, but it\u2019s also very much a parable of the world today.

His power comes not from a wand, but from dividing people against one another.\n\nSound familiar? It should.

Shown here in 2010, the mission was built in 1706. (NORBERTO DUARTE/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nInvestments in roads and cities can shape an economy for hundreds of years. Now economists are showing how one-time investments in education can endure every bit as long.\n\n[How 2,000-year-old roads predict modern-day prosperity]\n\nJesuits arrived late to the Guarani people\u2019s homeland where Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina meet. But their missions thrived until 1767, when King Charles III of Spain expelled all Jesuits from the Spanish Empire.\n\nYet even 250 years later, people living near the ruins of Jesuit missions complete 10 to 15 percent more years of education and earn 10 percent more than residents of equivalent towns without missions, according to a study published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics.\n\nMeasuring an intangible asset across centuries requires clever techniques. It also requires the perfect natural experiment. University of British Columbia economist Felipe Valencia Caicedo relied on both.\n\nValencia\u2019s analysis is among the most striking of a surge of studies that show how returns from education and vocational training span generations and even centuries.\n\nA historical experiment\n\nYou would need a randomized experiment to truly disentangle education from the confounding factors that usually come with it. You would scoop up entire communities and dump them in an isolated region. You would divide them into equally matched treatment and control groups, and observe everyone carefully for an epoch or two.\n\nValencia couldn\u2019t do that, for obvious ethical and practical reasons. But he found the next best thing. The 34-year-old Colombian, who studied economics at Brown, Yale, the London School of Economics and Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, has long been fascinated by Latin America\u2019s colonial past. He zeroed in on this isolated archipelago of Jesuit missions because they were free of complications that would make it impossible to tease out the effect of missions founded in, say, the megalopolis of Sao Paulo.\n\nFounded in 1534, three decades before it built its first South American mission, the Jesuit movement, with its technology and methodology, was advanced for its time. Importantly for this study, its members focused on education. Their Guarani missions were seen as an egalitarian, utopian experiment, earning such famous fans as Voltaire and Rousseau.\n\nAt the 30 missions Valencia studied, the Jesuits taught indigenous men and women of the Guarani tribe blacksmithing, arithmetic and embroidery. Those efforts stopped after the Jesuits were expelled.\n\nThe clean break made the perfect starting point for an economic analysis.\n\n\u201cMoral considerations aside, for us in economics colonialism is a nice historical experiment to study things that we care about,\u201d Valencia said. \u201cWe are not colonialists \u2026 but we can study these effects.\u201d\n\nMeasuring the effects\n\nBy piecing together data from archives in the Vatican, Spain, Paraguay and Argentina, Valencia found ample evidence that the Jesuits\u2019 training continued to influence the education and society of the Guarani people who lived nearest the missions.\n\n\n\nThe ruins of the Jesuit mission of Santisima Trinidad de Parana in Paraguay, pictured in 2018. (NORBERTO DUARTE/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nFor every 100 kilometers closer to a mission, poverty rates fall 10 percent and schooling rises by about 0.7 years. The effect was sharper 75 or 100 years ago, historical data shows, but as national literacy approaches the maximum of 100 percent, differences flatten out.\n\nFor variable after variable, Valencia found the same positive trend. That isn\u2019t an endorsement of the Jesuits\u2019 methods; he said his work shows the enduring power of investing in human beings, not the enduring power of colonialism or Catholicism.\n\n\u201cThis paper is not saying missions are good,\u201d Valencia said. \u201cThis paper is not saying Catholicism is good or didn\u2019t have any negative effects. This paper is saying even though people were converting indigenous people to Catholicism, while they were doing that they were also teaching them skills.\u201d\n\nPrinceton economist Leonard Wantchekon, working with Marko Kla\u0161nja of Georgetown and Natalija Novta of the International Monetary Fund, used different methodology but reached a similar conclusion in an analysis of the long-term effects of early 20th-century missionary schools in Benin.\n\nTheir analysis, published in the same journal, found the benefits of schooling to be contagious \u2014 one possible reason the benefits of education persist for generations.\n\n\u201cChildren whose parents did not attend school, but were living near those who went to school, did as well as those whose parents did attend school,\u201d Wantchekon said. \u201cIn other words, aspirations played an important role in intergenerational mobility.\"\n\nUniversity of Michigan economist Hoyt Bleakley has published several influential works that measure the long-term fallout of circumstances ranging from hookworm eradication in the American South to river portages on the East Coast. He said Wantchekon\u2019s and Valencia\u2019s work showed the durability of some human capital investments.\n\n\u201cThese fairly early human-capital-building institutions seem to leave a pretty significant footprint for generations,\u201d Bleakley said. \u201cMaybe for centuries.\u201d According to Bleakley, it\u2019s difficult to separate the effect of education from that of the cultures and institutions that tend to be adopted by educated people.\n\nIsolating causes\n\nAny armchair statistician can tell you that these findings are nigh on useless if they reflect a third variable, such as desirable location or high population density, that explains both mission location and education level. Which is why Valencia \u2014 like all economists who do this type of research \u2014 went to extraordinary lengths to tease apart correlation and causation.\n\nBecause they arrived after the Franciscans and others claimed prime mission territories, the Jesuits were forced to build their missions in unremarkable places. Today, the settlements near the missions are no more densely populated than the areas around them. Valencia\u2019s analysis of satellite data also shows they don\u2019t have temperatures, terrain or climate more conducive to growing crops. They\u2019re not closer to rivers or the coast, either.\n\nValencia found a number of natural control groups. People who immigrated to these communities, for example, don\u2019t show the same education trends as the native-born.\n\nThe Franciscans helped, too. The mendicant order had been in the area longer than the Jesuits. It wasn\u2019t expelled. But the Franciscans focused on poverty and health, rather than education and vocation. Valencia found that, perhaps as a result, families\u2019 economic and educational outcomes didn\u2019t vary based on their distance to that order\u2019s missions.\n\nMaybe the Jesuits had a preternatural ability to select locations that would later attract educated people? We can rule that out, too. There were numerous locations where the Jesuits started a mission but quickly abandoned it for reasons unrelated to its economic viability. Even those locations, compared with similar ones with long-lasting Jesuit missions, produced no measurable effect.\n\nFinally, Valencia ruled out institutions, which development economists consider to be a likely driver in cases like this. Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay had wildly different governments, data sets and institutional experiences over the centuries he studied, yet they all showed similar trends.\n\nPinpointing mechanisms\n\nValencia didn\u2019t just rule out other possible explanations. He also established a few reasons that areas near the missions have tended to succeed at higher rates, even today.\n\nPeople nearer the missions were more likely to pass knowledge from generation to generation. Valencia\u2019s survey showed this not just for skills taught by the missionaries, such as embroidery, journal-keeping and accounting, but also for traditional medicine and folklore not directly related to the Jesuit mission.\n\nHistorical descriptions of the missions emphasize vocational training that went beyond agriculture to trades and service industries. Today, the areas near the missions are more industrialized than their neighbors, and they tend to have more people employed in industries related to the professions emphasized by the missionaries, such as blacksmithing and teaching.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t imply that the differences remained constant, however, or that history is destiny. Areas near the missions embraced innovations more readily than their peers. Between 1996 and 2006, farmers nearer the missions in Brazil were faster to plant new, genetically engineered soybeans than those farther away.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that things are immutable,\u201d Valencia said. \u201cIt\u2019s that precisely because of this historical human capital shock, that people can change faster and can adapt faster to change.\u201d\n\nThe enduring educational and cultural imprint of that historical shock \u2014 an educational mission cut short about a decade before the U.S. war for independence \u2014 is strong evidence that investing in people produces long-term returns.\n\ncorrection: An earlier version of this story contained an incorrectly captioned image of the Jesuit mission of Santisima Trinidad Del Parana after a wire service error.

He is reportedly ready to turn his attention to that contest more fully, now that the 2018 midterm election is over.\n\nBy at least one metric, though, the 2018 election should give him pause about the prospect of serving two full terms.\n\nA colleague raised an interesting question: What does the House vote Tuesday night \u2014 the only contest in which nearly every American was asked to weigh in \u2014 tell us about the 2020 election? If we pit the votes for Democratic candidates in those races against the votes for the Republicans, where do we land?\n\nThe short answer is this: Democrats received about 4.4 million more votes than Republicans on Tuesday, according to the most recent tallies from the Associated Press. That\u2019s while votes are still being counted, including in Democrat-heavy California.\n\nUnlike in 2016, though, those votes were also distributed in a way that helps the Democrats. That margin translates to a 290-to-248 electoral vote edge for the Democrat.\n\nUNADJUSTED ADJUSTED AK ME WI VT NH WA ID MT ND MN IL MI NY MA OR NV WY SD IA IN OH PA NJ CT RI CA UT CO NE MO KY WV VA MD DE AZ NM KS AR TN NC SC DC OK LA MS AL GA HI TX FL\n\nThat margin comes as a result of Democrats flipping four states that voted for Trump in 2016: Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\n\nThose may not be the four states you\u2019d expect, given that Trump\u2019s 2016 victory was a result of close votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, not Iowa. He won Iowa by more than nine points (more than his margin in Texas) and North Carolina by four points. The House results in those states Tuesday, though, showed Democrats winning by four points in Iowa and two in North Carolina.\n\nBoth Iowa and North Carolina saw consistent shifts to the Democratic candidate in House races Tuesday, though \u2014 in Iowa by wide margins. (Shown below as larger blue boxes.)\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nBut the data powering our assessment of 2020 is not all that great. Notice that we said the House contests involved votes from nearly every American. In several states, candidates were reelected without opponents. That includes Florida, where the vote total for the GOP was narrow enough that uncontested Democratic reelections could have made the difference.\n\n(There are also places where multiple candidates from the same party faced off, boosting the vote totals for those parties. But those were in California, Louisiana and Washington, where the results weren\u2019t really in question, so we skipped them.)\n\nTo offset the uncontested races, we created an adjusted version of the data. To estimate the missing vote totals, we assigned each race a number of Democratic and Republican votes equivalent to the average across the state from contested races in which the same party ended up in control. So in Florida, a Democrat elected without an opponent was assigned vote tallies equivalent to the average of what was seen in other Florida House districts that elected Democrats.\n\nThe result? Not much different. Florida moved a bit to the Democrats, but the Republican candidate (presumably Trump) would still win. Wisconsin moves from a five-point Republican advantage to a 0.4-point one \u2014 less than the margin Trump had in 2016. North Carolina moved to the Republicans, but, again, didn\u2019t flip.\n\nThere are innumerable caveats here, drifting down on us like snowflakes. House races involve hundreds of candidates and hundreds of policy priorities. Presidential races tend to operate on a much narrower scale. What\u2019s more, the electorate for a midterm election, particularly this midterm election, may not look much like what we will see in 2020.\n\nAnd, that year, Trump is expected to be on the ballot, which might have an effect similar to what we saw between 2010 and 2012: a surge in the latter year among supporters of the president who were less inspired to vote in 2010. Then, of course, there\u2019s the other candidate, whoever he or she is. That person might spur his or her own surge in turnout.\n\nThey\u2019d better. After all, Trump has a one- to two-year head start on campaigning.", "\n\nTokyo Medical University President Yukiko Hayashi, right, talks to reporters on Wednesday about the school's previous practice of lowering women's entrance exam scores to keep the percentage of female students lower than men. (Kyodo News via AP)\n\nTokyo Medical University, one of Japan\u2019s top medical schools, spent years purposely rigging women\u2019s entrance exam scores in order to ensure that some of them couldn\u2019t attend the prestigious school.\n\nNow, the university\u2019s administration is walking back its controversial policy, offering spots to 101 people who were wrongly denied entrance in the last two years, Japanese news outlets reported this week.\n\nEarlier this year, the medical school acknowledged lowering exam grades of female applicants in order to keep the percentage of female students lower than men. The school said it had lowered women\u2019s grades and inflated men\u2019s results due to a doctor shortage in Japan, as some female doctors there have left the profession once they become mothers, causing staffing issues at Japanese hospitals.\n\nThe university\u2019s recently appointed president, Yukiko Hayashi, said at a news conference on Wednesday that out of the 101 students offered spots, the school only has room for 63. Applicants have until the end of the month to decide if they want to accept a spot, although some have already started their studies elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWe will conduct fair entrance exams and never allow a repeat of this inappropriate practice,\u201d the Guardian newspaper quoted Hayashi as saying. \u201cNobody should be discriminated against because of gender. There are many female doctors who are doing a wonderful job.\u201d\n\nBut experts say that rigging test scores in order to impact the Japanese workforce is inappropriate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a systematic problem in Japanese society that we\u2019re not supporting our mothers, but . . . this is the worst possible way to fix the problem,\u201d Yusuke Tsugawa, a Japanese doctor who is an assistant professor medicine at UCLA, told the Post in August.\n\nHifumi Okunuki, who teaches at Japan\u2019s Sagami Women\u2019s University, wrote in an op-ed for the Japan Times that she was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d by the realization the university was systematically discriminating against women -- noting the challenges and preparation it takes to even get to the point of taking an entrance exam for medical school.\n\n\u201cWe should really take a long, hard look at how unfair this score fraud is to female students, just as the corporate quit-upon-marriage and gender-based retirement age systems of yore were,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMost importantly of all, the women who were bumped to make way for the boys need to be given immediate and proper redress.\u201d\n\nIndeed, some female applicants have requested they be compensated over the scandal.\n\nAs for the men whose grades were inflated and may not have deserved entrance at all? At Wednesday\u2019s news conference, Hayashi apparently declined to comment on what would happen to them.\n\nAkiko Kashiwagi contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nA medical school in Japan didn\u2019t want too many women.

Then he was trampled by a boar.\n\nOkinawa\u2019s new governor says Tokyo \u2018disrespects democracy\u2019 by allowing new U.S. base", "A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that President Trump cannot immediately end the program that shields from deportation young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children.\n\nThe unanimous decision by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit makes it more likely that the Supreme Court will settle the question. The Trump administration has asked the justices to add it to the docket for this term.\n\nThe Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was begun in 2012 by President Barack Obama and has protected nearly 700,000 people brought to this country as children.\n\nThe Trump administration moved to end the program in 2017 after Texas and other states threatened to sue to force an end to the program. Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions advised the Department of Homeland Security to end the program, saying it was probably unlawful and that it could not be defended in court.\n\nBut a number of courts around the country have ruled that the administration\u2019s reasoning was incorrect and kept the program in place. Like the other courts, the panel did not question the administration\u2019s power but faulted its approach.\n\n\u201cTo be clear: we do not hold that DACA could not be rescinded as an exercise of Executive Branch discretion,\u201d Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw said in the opinion. \u201cWe hold only that here, where the Executive did not make a discretionary choice to end DACA \u2014 but rather acted based on an erroneous view of what the law required \u2014 the rescission was arbitrary and capricious under settled law.\u201d\n\nThe panel of judges, all nominated by Democratic presidents, flatly rejected the administration\u2019s position that courts lacked the power to review the executive branch\u2019s immigration actions.\n\n\u201cThe government may not simultaneously both assert that its actions are legally compelled, based on its interpretation of the law, and avoid review of that assertion by the judicial branch, whose \u2018province and duty\u2019 it is \u2018to say what the law is,\u2019 \u201d Wardlaw said, borrowing the language of the landmark Marbury v. Madison decision.\n\nWardlaw said the Obama administration was within its powers to enact DACA because it had to make a choice about how to direct limited resources in deporting undocumented immigrants and decided to spare those who came as children, had not committed crimes and were students or in the military.\n\n\u201cThe reality is (and always has been) that the executive agencies charged with immigration enforcement do not have the resources required to deport every single person present in this country without authorization,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd while the opinion does not purport to decide the wisdom of the policy, Wardlaw was clearly sympathetic.\n\n\u201cIt is no hyperbole to say that Dulce Garcia embodies the American dream,\u201d is how she begins the opinion, telling the story of a woman brought to this country by her parents as a 4-year-old who now has a thriving law practice in San Diego.\n\n\u201cRecognizing the cruelty and wastefulness of deporting productive young people to countries with which they have no ties, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced a policy in 2012 that would provide some relief to individuals like Garcia, while allowing our communities to continue to benefit from their contributions,\u201d Wardlaw said.\n\nThe panel\u2019s decision keeps in place an injunction from the lower court that allows DACA recipients to renew their applications. According to California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, more than 187,000 people \u201chave regained or extended their DACA protections as a result of the court\u2019s injunction, and hundreds of thousands of additional Dreamers are eligible to do so.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s actions on DACA were prompted by a threat by Texas and other states to sue to end the program.\n\nThe states had been successful in stopping an extension of a different program proposed by Obama, called the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program (DAPA).\n\nThe administration had been impatiently awaiting the 9th Circuit\u2019s decision on DACA, after oral arguments last spring. It sent a letter to the circuit last month, saying that if the decision was not handed down by Oct. 31, it would ask the Supreme Court to take up the issue.\n\nIt filed that request with the Supreme Court last week, but the justices have not acted upon it yet.\n\nThe case is Regents of the University of California v. Department of Homeland Security.", "Before the midterm elections, President Trump crossed the nation warning those attending his rallies of the oncoming threat of about 7,000 Central American migrants who are traveling through Mexico to seek asylum in the United States.\n\nWhile campaigning in Chattanooga, Tenn., for Republican Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn last Sunday, Trump suggested that the migrants were looking to come in and disrupt Americans' lives.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an invasion. I don\u2019t care what they say. I don\u2019t care what the fake media says. That\u2019s an invasion of our country,\u201d he said before rally attendees began chanting \u201cBuild the wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am telling the caravans, the criminals, the smugglers, the trespassers marching toward our border, turn back now, because you are not getting in. Turn back,\u201d Trump added.\n\nIt was also a frequent Twitter theme of his in late October.\n\nThe Caravans are made up of some very tough fighters and people. Fought back hard and viciously against Mexico at Northern Border before breaking through. Mexican soldiers hurt, were unable, or unwilling to stop Caravan. Should stop them before they reach our Border, but won\u2019t! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2018\n\nBut since Tuesday, the president has been mostly quiet on the No. 1 rallying issue for Republican voters, outside when asked about reporters by it in his Wednesday news conference. He became agitated when CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta pressed him on it then, and that testy exchange resulted in Acosta\u2019s White House media credentials being suspended.\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t tweeted about the caravan in days. His unwillingness to bring it up himself since the election has led critics to suggest that even the president knew that his level of attention to the issue was overblown.\n\nVoters went to the polls mindful of many issues, from health care to the economy to sexual assault. But according to Gallup, immigration was one of the top issues for Republican voters heading into the election. That\u2019s likely in part because of how often the topic had been mentioned by the president and Fox News.\n\nTrump has also been criticized for his dishonest characterization of the caravans, which are largely made up of women and children \u2014 not terrorists supposedly infiltrating the groups from the Middle East. The migrants were thousands of miles away at the time of Trump\u2019s campaign appearances, and they remain hundreds of miles away.\n\nRepublican voters far from the border have been fearful about the potential impact of the migrants getting asylum.\n\nCarol Shields, a 75-year-old Republican in northern Minnesota, shared with the New York Times her fears that migrant gangs could take over people\u2019s summer lake homes in the state. \u201cWhat\u2019s to stop them?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe have a lot of people who live on lakes in the summer and winter someplace else. When they come back in the spring, their house would be occupied.\u201d\n\nTrump is well aware of this anxiety \u2014 in part because it worked so well for him when he tapped into it in 2016. Trump launched his campaign painting Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists after years of stoking fears about the changing demographics of the United States during his regular appearances on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\nHe hoped that narrative about immigrants would be fruitful during the midterms, and to a large degree it seems to have been. The GOP will keep its Senate majority. Democrats did make big gains in governor\u2019s mansions and won control of the House, but the strength of the \u201cblue wave\u201d was not as mighty as Republicans once feared.\n\nThe day after the election, the Pentagon directed U.S. military commanders to stop referring to the deployment of active-duty troops to the southern border as \u201cOperation Faithful Patriot.\u201d Critics had called the name overtly political. But even though he has been mum about the caravans specifically, Trump is apparently moving forward with plans to change the rules about how immigrants can legally request asylum.\n\nNow forced to work with a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Trump likely will not to be able to move forward legislatively on the hard-line immigration proposals that got him elected. The president\u2019s characterization of the migrant caravan was never one that was deeply rooted in facts, and he may be leaving it behind for now. But he feels this is a winning issue for him, so it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see it in some form again soon.\n\nThis post has been updated.", "NEW YORK \u2014 Federal health officials on Thursday reported the first death in an ongoing salmonella outbreak linked to raw turkey.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the death was in California but didn\u2019t have any immediate details. Since last November, the agency said 164 people have fallen ill in 35 states, with the most recent case being reported on Oct. 20.\n\nNo products have been recalled, and the agency hasn\u2019t recommended that people avoid turkey. But it said it believes the outbreak is widespread and ongoing, and it reminded people to properly cook and handle turkey with Thanksgiving approaching.\n\n\u201cWe are still seeing new illnesses being reported on a weekly basis,\u201d said Colin Basler, an epidemiologist with the CDC.\n\nBasler noted there is a lag time between when a person gets sick and when the illness gets reported to health officials. The California Department of Public Health did not immediately respond to an email seeking additional details about the death.\n\nA single supplier hasn\u2019t been identified in connection with the outbreak. The rare salmonella strain was identified in live turkeys, as well as in ground turkey, turkey patties and raw turkey pet food.\n\nThe National Turkey Federation said in a statement that its members have reviewed their salmonella-control programs. The industry group said programs include vaccination and sanitation, such as wearing protective boots and clothing to reduce birds\u2019 exposure to pathogens.\n\nTo limit risk, the CDC recommends cooking turkey to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees, and washing hands and counters that have touched uncooked meat.\n\nSalmonella can be found in a variety of foods, including packaged foods.

Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nOpinion writer\n\nAs any political scientist will tell you, presidents keep most of the promises they make on the campaign trail, or at least try to. It can be a little harder to judge members of Congress. Most have little power on their own; you may have voted for Congressman Forehead because he told you he would clean up Washington, revive the economy and protect Social Security, but he won\u2019t be accomplishing those things single-handedly.\n\nAnd yet there are times when a party makes a collective argument in a campaign, and we can look to see whether it followed through.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the main functions the campaign serves: Each party tells the voters what the urgent challenges are and what it thinks needs to be done about them, and then the voters judge it on those agendas. And this year, the Republican Party could hardly have been clearer. Its agenda came down to two things:\n\nProtect Americans with preexisting medical conditions. Save us from a caravan of migrants filled with MS-13 gangsters, Middle Eastern terrorists, and probably a Nazgul or two, all of whom were on their way to kill you and your family.\n\nSome candidates emphasized one more than the other, but that was the core of the Republican argument. So now that the election is over and Republicans still control the White House and the Senate, they\u2019ll be keeping those promises. Right?\n\nWeirdly enough, they will. How? By making them disappear. Let\u2019s start with the first promise. This was one of the most shocking collective lies in memory, as the entire GOP did an abrupt 180-degree turn to claim that it was firmly, passionately committed to maintaining the protections in the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans have been fighting to destroy ever since the law was signed in 2010.\n\nWhile they obviously couldn\u2019t say so explicitly, at times it sounded as though they had literally switched sides and were now battling to protect the ACA from some unnamed antagonist, which of course was themselves. To take just one example, Martha McSally, who may or may not be the next senator from Arizona (votes are still being counted), claimed she was \u201cleading the fight\u201d to \u201cforce insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions,\u201d which of course they\u2019re already forced to do by the ACA.\n\nFortunately, keeping this promise requires Republicans to do nothing more than stand down and let the ACA be. Which (in Congress, anyway) is exactly what they\u2019re doing:\n\nThe day after crushing midterm election losses handed Democrats control of the House, GOP leaders signaled they had no appetite to make another go at shredding the signature accomplishment of Obama\u2019s presidency anytime soon. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty obvious, the Democratic House is not going to be interested in that,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who suggested instead that lawmakers address the flaws in the Affordable Care Act \u201con a bipartisan basis.\u201d Beyond the practical barriers, Republicans also offered a political imperative for abandoning the nearly decade-old fight: the defeats they suffered to Democrats who ran hard against their efforts to roll back the law.\n\nSo congratulations, Republicans, on keeping your promise to protect people with preexisting conditions by no longer trying to take away protections for people with preexisting conditions.\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s the small matter of the lawsuit filed by Republicans in 19 states and supported by the Trump administration, which would nullify the entire ACA, not to mention the administration\u2019s promotion of junk insurance plans that don\u2019t cover preexisting conditions. If that lawsuit succeeds, the whole game will be up. Which is why I suspect that they\u2019re secretly hoping it fails. After spending all that time claiming they wanted to protect people, the last thing they want is for the public to be reminded, in a catastrophic way, of what they\u2019ve been trying to do for so long.\n\nWhat about the other promise, to protect us from the terrifying invasion of asylum seekers from the south? I have some good news there too: You and your family will not be killed by the caravan. Thanks, Republicans!\n\nOf course, the reason is that the caravan was never a threat in the first place. It wasn\u2019t full of gang members and terrorists, and as previous caravans had, its numbers will diminish on the hundreds of miles its participants still have to walk as some people turn back or decide to stay in Mexico. When those who remain reach the border, they\u2019ll present themselves to American officials and request asylum. Those requests will be evaluated in a process our government conducts every day; some claims will be successful, and others won\u2019t.\n\nWhat we do know is that now that the election is over, Republicans will stop talking about it. What two days ago was a terrifying threat to the life of every Fox News viewer will be quickly forgotten. As for President Trump\u2019s campaign gimmick of sending 5,200 troops to the border to protect against the onrushing horde, the Pentagon has already dropped the self-parodying name for the mission (it was called \u201cOperation Faithful Patriot,\u201d because I guess \u201cOperation Trumpmerica Star Spangled Eagleflag\u201d would have been a bit much). Don\u2019t be surprised if in the coming weeks, the troops are quietly sent back to their regular duties.\n\nIn other words, everything Republicans promised and talked about during the campaign will simply disappear into thin air. They won\u2019t bother talking about safeguarding protections for preexisting conditions any more, having given up on their effort to do just the opposite. They won\u2019t bother talking about protecting us from the migrant menace, because it was always largely hyped. Republicans can just lay low and hope people forget about all of it. Whatever else you might say about them, you have to admit they\u2019re clever.", "Cape May Brewing Co., a small business in southern New Jersey, is losing money on beer cans, thanks to President Trump\u2019s 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum. (Jim Flynn Photography/Cape May Brewing Co.)\n\nFor American brewers, metal tariffs are a bit of a buzzkill.\n\nThis summer, as the United States, Canada and Mexico tried to cut a new North American trade deal, President Trump slapped tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum.\n\nMore than a month after the countries reached a provisional agreement for the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, those tariffs are still in place.\n\nCanadian industry has been bruised, but so have a number of U.S. businesses, including beer.\n\nIn a vivid example of how Trump\u2019s trade tactics abroad can hurt business at home, the U.S. beer industry, which needs aluminum to make cans, is seeing costs rise.\n\n\n\nBrewers say the math is simple: A cold can of beer requires a can, which requires aluminum. As tariffs roil the market, sending prices up, the cost of producing each can increases.\n\n\n\n\u201cI appreciate what they are trying to do with tariffs,\u201d Cape May Brewing Co. CEO Ryan Krill said. \u201cBut it definitely has unintended consequences for small business like ours.\u201d (Jim Flynn Photography/Cape May Brewing Co.)\n\nThe Trump administration has played down the impact. In a television appearance in March, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross held cans of Budweiser, Campbell\u2019s Soup and Coca-Cola before the camera and called the per-can cost increase \u201cno big deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that goes up by 25 percent, that\u2019s about six-tenths of one cent,\u201d he said, holding the soup can. \u201cWho in the world is going to be too bothered by six-tenths of a cent?\u201d\n\nThe Beer Institute, a U.S. trade group, says brewers are bothered. It projects that over a year, tariffs on foreign aluminum could increase the cost of beer production by $347 million. (U.S. beer sales totaled $111.4 billion in 2017, according to the Brewers Association.)\n\nThe industry has found common cause with Canadians and others, calling on the Trump administration to scrap the tariffs before the ceremonial signing of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal, which may come as early as the end of the month.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to see these tariffs repealed,\u201d said Jim McGreevy, president and CEO of the Beer Institute.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping that the renegotiation of NAFTA would have taken the steel and aluminum tariffs off the table, but all indications are that the tariffs will continue,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that does not bode well for American beer.\u201d\n\nThe impact is already being felt, said Ryan Krill, co-founder and CEO of Cape May Brewing Co., a small brewery in southern New Jersey.\n\nKrill, who started his business in 2011, says rising aluminum prices will cost him about $30,000 this year \u2014 a big sum for a small team. \u201cWe could get a lot of miles out of that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a bummer.\u201d\n\nTo understand why U.S. beer is having a bummer year, look to the aluminum market \u2014 and to Trump.\n\nAfter years of tough talk on trade, the president in March announced a 25 percent tariff on foreign steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum.\n\nThe Trump administration argued that reliance on foreign metals is a threat to U.S. national security. The administration also wanted to put pressure on China, a leading producer of aluminum, to change its trade practices.\n\nThough many U.S. businesses support the idea of taking a tough line with Beijing, members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet, economic advisers and industry groups warned that tariffs would create uncertainty and increase costs for U.S. companies that import goods.\n\nInitially, Canada, Mexico and the European Union were granted exemptions. But as the United States, Canada and Mexico negotiated this summer, Trump changed course, saying publicly that the move was meant to gain leverage over Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States has been taken advantage of for many decades on trade,\u201d Trump said in a May 31 statement. \u201cThose days are over. Earlier today, this message was conveyed to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada: The United State[s] will agree to a fair deal, or there will be no deal at all.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that the U.S. and Canadian aluminum markets are intricately linked, said Matt Meenan, senior director for public affairs at the Aluminum Association, a trade group.\n\nA piece of aluminum may cross the border five times during production. \u201cCanada and the U.S. is almost like one market,\u201d he said.\n\nSo when Trump hit Canada, he also hit the United States.\n\nTariffs on foreign aluminum benefit U.S. aluminum smelters, including Kentucky-based Century Aluminum, which is investing millions of dollars in a push to double its output.\n\nBut the United States has few smelters, and American manufacturers that buy aluminum, including carmakers, soda canners and beer brewers, stand to lose.\n\n\u201cThis is putting a question mark on future investment,\u201d Meenan said. \u201cIt comes down to uncertainty.\u201d\n\nThe lack of certainty is already hurting business, brewers say.\n\nIn a May 14 Wall Street Journal op-ed, the chairman of Molson Coors Brewing Co., Pete Coors, said that Trump\u2019s trade war already was disrupting the sector.\n\n\u201cA cold can of beer on a hot summer day is as American as it gets,\u201d Coors wrote. \u201cBut now that experience will cost you more.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s U.S. business, MillerCoors, said that Trump\u2019s trade war rhetoric and tactics have since worsened irregularities in the aluminum market, particularly in relation to the Midwest Premium, a fee that largely determines the cost of buying bulk aluminum across North America.\n\nSince early this year, when President Trump stepped up tariff talk, the Midwest Premium has jumped 137 percent, leading to $40 million in additional costs for MillerCoors, CEO Gavin Hattersley said in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cMillerCoors does not support tariffs of any kind and believes that free and open markets are ultimately what\u2019s best for the beer industry,\u201d he said.\n\nMany smaller, craft brewers are sending a similar message.\n\nThe Brewers Association, a trade group for independent and craft brewers, also opposes the tariffs, arguing that they \u201cundermine the Trump administration\u2019s pro-job, pro-growth agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe market uncertainty and financial penalties created by these tariffs negatively affect a growing manufacturing sector of the American economy: the craft brewing industry,\u201d Brewers Association President and CEO Bob Pease said in a June 5 statement.\n\n\u201cWe urge this Administration to reconsider these tariffs, as they place an unnecessary burden on small, Main Street business owners who are creating thousands of jobs and pouring money back into their local economies.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty may prevent Krill of Cape May Brewing from reinvesting in his business until the long-term impact of the tariffs becomes clear.\n\n\u201cI appreciate what they are trying to do with tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it definitely has unintended consequences for small businesses like ours.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nApologizing for Canada\u2019s rejection of Jews in 1939, Trudeau vows to fight anti-Semitism\n\nCanada\u2019s response to Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s death is a test for Trudeau\n\nThree things you need to know before you go to Canada for some legal weed\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "FILE - In this Saturday, Nov. 11, 2017, file photo, Demonstrators burn flares and wave Polish flags during the annual march to commemorate Poland\u2019s National Independence Day in Warsaw, Poland.

They\u2019ve arrived bearing piles of emails and text messages, as well as their memories of once-private phone chats. One even arrived with his therapy dog.\n\nNow that the midterm elections are over, the investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III will no longer be constrained by the long-standing tradition of going dormant in the weeks before voters go to the ballot boxes. President Trump\u2019s decision to force the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions this week adds a new twist to the saga. Stone, a longtime Trump confidant, has for months urged the president to fire Sessions. At a rally in Washington in September, Stone called Sessions \u201can insubordinate hillbilly\u201d and pressed Trump to send the former senator from Alabama back to his home state.\n\n[Roger Stone helped Donald Trump get elected president. Now he\u2019s helping himself.]\n\nStone has aroused suspicion because of statements he made during the summer of 2016 predicting that WikiLeaks would soon release damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

As host, French President Emmanuel Macron is embracing a post-national, pan-European understanding of the past \u2014 and vision of the future.\n\nBut the World War I centennial arrives at a moment when the European project and transatlantic alliance are under strain \u2014 and nationalism is seeing a startling resurgence.\n\nAnti-European Union sentiment has grown even in countries where right-wing populists have performed poorly at the polls, and Brussels has struggled to respond to flagrant assaults on European values as basic as the rule of law.\n\nHeads of state assert \u201cItaly First,\u201d \u201cHungary First\u201d and \u201cAmerica First,\u201d echoing language deployed by those who argued against U.S. involvement in the world wars and League of Nations.\n\nAnd collective aversion to the term \u201cnationalist\u201d has begun to recede.\n\n\u201cYou know, they have a word \u2014 it sort of became old-fashioned,\u201d President Trump said at a rally last month. \u201cIt\u2019s called a nationalist. And I say, really? We\u2019re not supposed to use that word. You know what I am? I\u2019m a nationalist, okay? I\u2019m a nationalist. Nationalist. Nothing wrong. Use that word.\u201d\n\nMargaret MacMillan, a World War I historian at the University of Oxford, said the cavalier language evinces a mentality that peace is the default and even inevitable condition.\n\n\u201cWe in the West, in particular, have been extremely lucky. We\u2019ve lived through an extremely long period of peace,\u201d she said. \u201cThe worry is that we take peace for granted and think it\u2019s a normal state of affairs. We should reflect that sometimes wars do happen \u2014 and sometimes not for very good reasons.\u201d\n\nIn advance of the gathering in Paris, Macron has positioned himself as Europe\u2019s leading challenger to the rising tide of nationalism. He has said that leaders such as Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban are right to see him as their biggest opponents and warned \u2014 in an address to the United Nations \u2014 that unilateralism inevitably engenders \u201cwithdrawal and conflict.\u201d\n\n\u201cA survival-of-the-fittest approach does not protect any group of people against any kind of threat,\u201d Macron said.\n\n\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron lays a wreath at the Notre Dame de Lorette war cemetery near Arras on Nov. 8, 2018. (Francois Mori/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMacron\u2019s Armistice Day plans reflect his commitment to the postwar project. As envisaged by the French president, a ceremony Sunday on the Champs-Elysees will be a solemn affair, remembering lives lost rather than celebrating a war victory \u2014 much to the chagrin of some French conservatives. That will be followed by a three-day peace forum that aims to \u201cstrengthen multilateralism and international cooperation.\u201d\n\nIf the event celebrates anything, it will be the long legacy of peace, which eluded the continent after the First World War but has now held more or less intact for seven decades. To Macron and other defenders of the European Union, the oft-maligned institution is a critical reason.\n\n\u201cThe European Union is the rejection of the two world wars \u2014 that\u2019s what it is. It\u2019s a way of creating the economic and democratic stability that did not emerge after World War I,\u201d said Yale University historian Jay Winter.\n\nThe degree to which the European Union\u2019s post-nationalist vision has transformed the continent is evident in the German region of Saarland, an area of 1 million residents hard on the French border.\n\nThe region \u2014 marked by lush forests, gentle hills and rich coal deposits that once made Saarland an industrial jackpot \u2014 has changed hands eight times over the past 250 years. In the past century alone, it was traded between France and Germany four times.\n\n\n\nThe German Nazi army parades in Saarland after the region rejoined the German Reich in 1935. (AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe first of those came in the aftermath of World War I, when France claimed the territory as compensation for German destruction of France\u2019s own coal industry.\n\nGermany lost the land again after World War II and only got it back in 1957.\n\nAs recently as the 1990s, the nearby border was subject to strict controls. But today, it\u2019s largely invisible. French citizens commute to Saarland for work or pop by to buy a dishwasher. Germans cross into France for lunch or to pick up a bottle of wine. French \u2014 the language of the longtime enemy and occupier \u2014 is part of the fabric of Saarland, and it\u2019s welcome.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re neighbors. We\u2019re friends. We marry each other. One hundred years ago, we killed each other. It\u2019s been a great evolution,\u201d said Reiner Jung, deputy director at the Saar Historical Museum in the region\u2019s capital, Saarbr\u00fccken.\n\nAs Jung spoke, trench walls loomed overhead \u2014 not real ones but models built by the museum for its World War I exhibit to give visitors some feel for the conflict\u2019s dominant battle motif. On the walls, the exhibit traces Germany\u2019s descent into a war that would cost the nation 2.5 million of its own citizens.\n\nWorld War I occupies a more limited space in the German historical imagination than it does for France, Britain or Belgium. Few of the battles were on German soil, and the horrors of the war that was to follow \u2014 World War II \u2014 overshadow all else in the nation\u2019s historical memory.\n\nBut the lessons of both wars are woven into the country\u2019s modern DNA. As other nations have swung toward populists pledging to look out for their own country\u2019s interests \u2014 at the expense of everyone else \u2014 Germany has stayed relatively rooted in international cooperation.\n\n\n\nFrench President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, left, and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl stand together during a French-German reconciliation ceremony in September 1984.

I hope we\u2019ve learned that.\u201d\n\nGermany\u2019s World War I commemorations were accompanied by little rancor. Although World War II sets off red-hot debates over whether the country can ever fully atone for its atrocities, the legacy of World War I is far less combustible, said Lucian H\u00f6lscher, an emeritus history professor at the Ruhr University Bochum.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long time ago,\u201d he said.\n\nOne measure of just how long: Unlike during other major anniversaries of the war, Germany has marked the centenary occasions alongside its onetime enemies. It will do so again Sunday, with Chancellor Angela Merkel traveling to Paris, and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier visiting London for a ceremony with Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n\u201cIt has really been a European commemoration,\u201d H\u00f6lscher said. \u201cThat\u2019s something very new.\u201d\n\nWitte reported from Saarbr\u00fccken.

Zero point zero,\u201d said Matt Bennett, a senior vice president of the centrist Democratic thank tank Third Way, referring to two prominent progressive groups that emerged from Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential bid \u2014 Our Revolution and Justice Democrats. Our Revolution did not dispute that figure. Spokesperson Diane May said the group still won at least 67 races overall and noted that two of its endorsed candidates, J.D. Scholten, who challenged Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, and Liuba Grechen Shirley, who took on Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., came \u201cvery close to unseating incumbents.\u201d On the other side, according to the moderate New Democrat Coalition, which cast a wider net in its endorsements, candidates in 23 of the roughly 29 seats Democrats have netted so far were backed by the group.\n\nDemocrats who were smart enough to unite around a singular focus on health care \u2014 gosh, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) turned out to be a pretty good strategist, huh? \u2014 should be smart enough to learn that, outside deep-blue enclaves, they better run candidates who will win and hold onto all those new female, suburban and college-educated voters.\n\nIt is also important to note that the difference between moderate and progressive Democrats is much smaller than the gap, say, between the Freedom Caucus and the defeated suburban House Republicans. (\u201cIlyse Hogue, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, cited as an example Jacky Rosen, who won a Nevada Senate seat Tuesday by ousting Republican incumbent Dean Heller. \u2018I don\u2019t think anybody thinks of Jacky as a foaming-at-the-mouth liberal, she just holds the values of reproductive freedom, gun safety and expanding access to healthcare and made her case to the people of Nevada in an authentic way,\u2019 Hogue said.\u201d)\n\nIn fact, the definitions of \u201cmoderate Democrat\u201d and \u201cprogressive Democrat\u201d are shifting as even red America embraces issues such as Medicaid expansion and minimum-wage increases. (Missouri and Arkansas voted to raise their minimum wages to $12 and $13 dollars, respectively, over several years.) It\u2019s not as though moderate Democrats want to cut entitlements or round up and deport \u201cdreamers.\u201d The biggest distinction may be whether Democrats embrace the Our Revolution list of \u201cfree\u201d things (e.g., single-payer health care, free college education), and whether they look at the private sector as either a benefit and potential agent of positive change or as an enemy of social and economic progress.\n\nThe leaders of Third Way made another sound observation in an op-ed for The Post:\n\nAll of this belies the lazy conventional wisdom that has started to solidify about the new diversity in Democratic politics: Support for the magnificent range of diverse candidates who have been inspired to run simply does not equal a demand for democratic socialism. These midterms will usher in a new generation of Democrats that is more representative of the full panoply of voters than any class in history. In the 116th Congress, close to 40 percent of the Democratic caucus in the House will be women, nearly half the caucus may be nonwhite, and the LGBTQ community could boast as many as eight representatives \u2014 all a record. That is a welcome and overdue change for the party. But don\u2019t assume people of color, women and LGBTQ candidates are all populists or far-left progressives. They run the ideological gamut inside the party. . . . You don\u2019t get that sort of diversity anywhere else. In fact, in its groundbreaking 8,000-person survey, More in Common found that \u201cprogressive activists\u201d in the electorate are 92 percent white. Of all the \u201cpolitical tribes\u201d it identified in its report on \u201cThe Exhausted Majority,\u201d only \u201cdevoted conservatives\u201d (at 94 percent) are more consistently white.\n\nThat might explain why, despite his socialist moniker Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), sounds tone-deaf at times. (\u201cI think you know there are a lot of white folks out there who are not necessarily racist who felt uncomfortable for the first time in their lives about whether or not they wanted to vote for an African-American,\u201d Sanders said, unbelievably. I don\u2019t suppose he\u2019d win Florida in a general election after essentially calling them bigots.)\n\nNow, not all super-progressives lost, and moderates had their own losses \u2014 most glaringly in Senate races in Missouri and Indiana. For now, the party should be happy that both Sen. Jon Tester, a moderate, ran and won reelection in Montana and that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive, ran and won her congressional race in New York.\n\nAs for 2020, Democrats would be wise to do two things. First, work on getting young and nonwhite voters engaged and ready to turn out in places such as Texas and Arizona. The next time a Beto O\u2019Rourke runs, he might win. Second, remember, as a party out of power, Democrats must maintain a broad coalition \u2014 keep their loyal friends loyal, cement ties to first-time Democratic voters who fled the GOP, and find a presidential ticket that can mirror the success of winners such as Rosen, new Rust Belt Democratic governors and new suburban Democratic House members. Follow the winners\u2019 advice, not the losers\u2019.", "MEXICO CITY \u2014 The party of Mexico\u2019s president-elect submitted legislation Thursday that would legalize marijuana possession, public use, growing and sales.\n\nSen. Olga Sanchez Cordero presented the measure, saying that everyone should have \u201cthe right to carry up to 30 grams (one ounce) of cannabis.\u201d People could carry more than an ounce if they requested a permit to do so under the proposal.\n\n\u201cFrom the point of view of negative effects, there is no reason why marijuana should not be legal, if alcohol and tobacco are,\u201d according to the bill.\n\nCordero has been picked as interior secretary by President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office Dec. 1. She is currently a senator for Lopez Obrador\u2019s leftist Morena party.\n\nHer bill also would allow every Mexican to grow up to 20 marijuana plants on private property and produce up to 17 ounces (480 grams) a year. Public smoking of marijuana would be allowed, \u201cexcept in tobacco smoke-free spaces.\u201d\n\nSales of marijuana would be regulated by a special agency, which would oversee purity, packaging and quality.

Robert C. \u201cBobby\u201d Scott (Va.), the top Democrat on the House Education Committee.\n\nThe National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado at Boulder\u2019s School of Education put together five charts from that analysis that shed light on the link between poverty, race and college. (High-poverty schools are defined as having free or reduced-price meal rates of at least 75 percent. Low-poverty schools have rates under 25 percent.) The data are the latest available, from the 2015-16 school year.\n\nThe center also recommended ways to improve college preparation for students at high-poverty schools.\n\nHere are the charts:\n\n1) Students of color are more likely to attend high-poverty high schools.\n\n2) High-poverty schools are less likely to offer calculus and physics.\n\n3) High-poverty schools are less likely to offer advanced placement courses and access to dual enrollment in high school and college classes. High- and low-poverty schools are equally likely to offer international baccalaureate classes, but relatively few of either provide access to this option.\n\n4) Most four-year colleges\u2019 admissions requirements call for students to take three math credits and three science credits in high school.\n\n5) Most four-year colleges require students to take a math sequence that includes, at the very least, algebra I, geometry and algebra II. Most require a science sequence that includes, at the very least, biology, chemistry and physics. A smaller percentage of high-poverty schools offer the math and science sequences required by most four-year colleges.\n\nHere are the National Education Policy Center\u2019s recommendations for closing the gap. These refer to the center\u2019s Schools of Opportunity project, which honors schools nationwide that work hard to provide opportunities for all students to learn no matter what their family circumstance.\n\nWhat Can Be Done to Bridge the College-Prep Gap? The between-school differences in access to college-preparatory classes present a very real barrier facing low-income communities and communities of color. It will be necessary to address these inequalities if our society is to close opportunity gaps. But we think it important to highlight three points: 1. Access to college-prep classes must be connected to corresponding access to the supports and resources necessary for students and their teachers to be successful. 2. In schools throughout the U.S., tracking (or \u201cability grouping\u201d) systems deny low-income students and students of color access to college-prep courses even when those classes are indeed offered in their schools. 3. The GAO report analyzes what it calls \u201chigh-poverty schools\u201d \u2014 those where at least three quarters of the students live in poverty. This is itself the core problem. Any serious effort to close opportunity gaps must begin by addressing this concentrated poverty, as well as the associated racial segregation. In the meantime, educational leaders might look to some of the schools recognized by NEPC\u2019s Schools of Opportunity program, where high-poverty high schools do offer their students a rigorous and equitable college-prep curriculum. For example: * At Rainier Beach High School in Seattle (where the poverty rate is 75 percent), all 11th and 12th grade students take at least one International Baccalaureate course. *At Seaside High School in California (where the poverty rate is 74 percent), all students take core courses that prepare them for admittance to the University of California.\n\n[This school was on the brink of closure.

(Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, the daughter of former vice president Richard B. Cheney, is likely to enter the top echelon of House Republican leadership after the current conference chairwoman, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, decided Thursday that she would not seek a fourth term in the position.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers\u2019s move to vacate her leadership post, confirmed Thursday by a person familiar with her decision, comes after Republicans lost their eight-year House majority by at least eight and possibly as many as 15 seats in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nLiz Cheney (R-Wyo.) launched her leadership bid Wednesday under the expectation that McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) would seek to keep her post. In a letter to colleagues, Cheney signaled dissatisfaction with the job McMorris Rodgers had done and pledged to be a more aggressive messenger for Republicans \u2014 one of the chief jobs for a conference chair.\n\n\u201cAlthough the 115th Congress has been one of the most productive in history, our message isn\u2019t breaking through,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFor us to prevail in this new environment, we must fundamentally overhaul and modernize our House GOP communications operation.\u201d\n\nCheney is the only candidate who has declared a desire for the post. If she is chosen in next week\u2019s Republican leadership elections, it would mark a swift ascent for Cheney, 52, who was first elected to the House in 2016 but has long shown a desire to climb the GOP ranks \u2014 for instance, launching a 2014 primary challenge against Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) before withdrawing, citing family health issues.\n\nCheney\u2019s father occupied the conference chair post from 1987 to 1989 before leaving the House to become defense secretary and, years later, vice president. The current vice president, Mike Pence, also held the job from 2009 to 2011.\n\nFor McMorris Rodgers, leaving the GOP leadership table spares Republicans a divisive contest as they seek to settle their top positions after Tuesday\u2019s losses.\n\nA top fundraiser, McMorris Rodgers was the only member of the existing leadership who faced a tough reelection challenge this year, and she ended up winning a comfortable victory in her rural eastern-Washington district. Before the election, she made it known that she would seek to become House majority whip in the expectation that Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) would move up to speaker and Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) would become the new floor leader if the GOP held the House.\n\nThe largely thankless job of conference chair is set to become even more thankless with Republicans in the minority. Now McMorris Rodgers is likely to focus on climbing the ladder on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, pursuing a subcommittee gavel and setting up a potential return to the leadership fold at a later date, according to the person familiar with her thinking.\n\nThe lack of a competitive race for conference chair further clarifies the GOP leadership picture as lawmakers prepare to return to work next week. McCarthy faces Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) for the minority-leader post, but there are few signs that McCarthy will fall short. Scalise, meanwhile, is running unopposed to remain as whip.", "Juul e-cigarettes are appealing to young people because they are easy to hide and come in a variety of flavors. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration, alarmed by a huge increase in vaping among minors, is expected to impose severe restrictions on the sale of e-cigarette products throughout the United States \u2014 actions that will probably have a significant impact on an industry that has grown exponentially in recent years with little government oversight.\n\nAs soon as next week, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is expected to announce a ban on the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes in tens of thousands of convenience stores and gas stations across the country, according to senior agency officials. The agency will also impose such rules as age-verification requirements for online sales, the officials say.\n\nGottlieb also is expected to propose banning menthol in regular cigarettes. The agency has been collecting public comments on such a prohibition, which is a major goal of the public health community but is likely to be strongly opposed by the cigarette industry.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s initiatives on vaping are spurred by preliminary government data that show \u00ade-cigarette use rose 77 percent among high schoolers and nearly 50 percent among middle schoolers in 2018. That means 3.5 million children were vaping in early 2018, up 1 million from 2017.\n\nGottlieb, who once served on the board of a North Carolina vaping company, was at one time viewed as an ally of the e-cigarette industry, and he delayed some critical e-cigarette rules shortly after becoming commissioner in 2017. He has also said his first priority is protecting children from tobacco-related disease. Most vaping products are flavored, and studies show teenagers are attracted to the flavors.\n\n\u201cWe now have evidence that a new generation is being addicted to nicotine, and we can\u2019t tolerate that,\u201d he said, referring to the vaping data in an interview before he made his final decision on e-cigarette policy.\n\n\n\nFood and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is expected to announce the banning of flavored e-cigarettes. Studies show the flavors attract teenagers, and Gottlieb has said protecting minors from smoking-related health problems is a top priority. (Astrid Riecken/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe only exception to the \u00adflavored-products ban in convenience stores involves mint and menthol \u00ade-cigarette products. The FDA will continue to permit sales of those flavors because menthol is permitted in regular cigarettes, and the agency doesn\u2019t want to give traditional cigarettes an advantage over e-cigarettes. But the FDA may extend the sales restriction to those flavors if teen vaping doesn\u2019t decline, officials said.\n\nGottlieb\u2019s actions apply to a specific kind of vaping product that dominates the youth market \u2014 e-cigarettes that use prepackaged flavor cartridges, or pods. That includes the wildly popular vaping products by Juul Labs. The restrictions don\u2019t apply to the \u201copen-tank\u201d systems available in vape shops.\n\nResearch indicates many \u00ade-cigarette users are likely to become addicted to nicotine and some will probably end up on regular cigarettes, a product that kills half of its long-term users. Moreover, the long-term health consequences of vaping are not known.\n\nAt the same time, vaping devotees and \u201charm-reduction\u201d advocates have said e-cigarettes represent a powerful tool in helping adult smokers to quit more dangerous cigarettes. They have warned that making it harder for adults to buy e-cigarettes \u2014 or depriving them of flavored products \u2014 will be detrimental.\n\n\u201cWe have to be really careful not to overreact to the youth problem,\u201d said David Abrams, professor of social and behavioral sciences at New York University.\n\nJuul, which accounts for more than 70 percent of the retail market, is sold in tens of thousands of retail outlets.\n\nGottlieb\u2019s steps will almost certainly be criticized as too aggressive by the industry and too weak by public health groups and Democratic lawmakers, whose election victory will probably embolden them in efforts to curb youths\u2019 use of e-cigarettes.\n\nThe tobacco-control groups are demanding restrictions on marketing and a ban on all e-cigarette flavors until manufacturers can prove that such flavors benefit public health by helping adults quit smoking regular cigarettes without increasing vaping by youths.\n\n\u201cAs long as the FDA allows these companies to peddle these flavors, you will see a steady increase in kids addicted to this product,\u201d said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) in a recent interview.\n\nGottlieb has resisted an across-the-board ban because he wants to ensure that flavored products are available to adults who want to use them as aids to quit smoking regular cigarettes. Such devices could be a potentially less harmful source of nicotine, he said.\n\n\u201cWe know that adults transition off combustible products and that flavors play a role in that,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to foreclose the opportunity for adults to get these products.\u201d\n\nAdult smoking rates in the United States dropped to their lowest level last year, at 14 percent, continuing a downward trend after a peak in 1965, but cigarettes kill an estimated 480,000 Americans per year.\n\nThe flavored e-cigarette products will be available in vape and tobacco shops, which the FDA believes are more careful about verifying the age of the purchasers. It\u2019s also possible that some flavored products could return to convenience stores \u2014 but only if the manufacturers prove a public health benefit and get specific authorization from the agency, which could take years. Under federal law, tobacco products can\u2019t be sold to people under 18. In some states and localities, the age is higher.\n\nGottlieb also is expected to warn that further e-cigarette restrictions might occur if use by youths doesn\u2019t start to decline.\n\nFDA officials, who recently conducted a crackdown on underage retail sales of e-cigarettes to minors and are investigating whether products are being sold illegally, were alarmed by the number of violations in convenience stores.\n\nGregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, a consumer group, has stressed the importance of having \u00ade-cigarettes available to adults in convenience stores and online \u2014 especially those who live in rural areas that might not have vape shops. \u201cSeverely restricting the availability of these devices does not seem to be in the interest of public health,\u201d he said.\n\nConvenience-store interests already have started questioning Gottlieb\u2019s legal ability to restrict the sale of e-cigarettes to a specific type of store.\n\nJuul, a sleek e-cigarette introduced in 2015, has taken much of the blame for the rise in use by youths. A technical and design breakthrough, the e-cigarette looks like a USB flash drive and, in a break from past vaping products, delivers high levels of nicotine that are smooth, not harsh. Each of its pods, which come in such flavors as mango and cucumber, provides as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes.\n\nThe company\u2019s early marketing strategy included a launch party with attractive young models whose images were shared widely on social media sites such as Twitter and Instagram.\n\nToday, the company is engulfed in a backlash resulting from the surge in youth use.

The ads carry the tag\u00adline, \u201cThe alternative for adult smokers.\u201d It also has pledged $30 million to reduce underage use.

(El Tiempo Photo via AP File) (Associated Press)\n\nBOGOTA, Colombia \u2014 The widow of Pablo Escobar fell madly in love as a preteen with the man who would rise to be a ruthless drug lord, but she says she felt raped when at age 14 he forced her to have a clandestine abortion, and over time came to view him as a cruel psychopath.\n\nThe revelation comes in a memoir, \u201cMy Life and My Prison With Pablo Escobar,\u201d in which Maria Henao for the first time opens up about her life alongside one of the world\u2019s most ruthless criminals, portraying herself more as a victim of the boundless violence of the Medellin cartel boss than as an accomplice to his lawbreaking.\n\nIn the book\u2019s epilogue, titled \u201cThe secret I\u2019ve held for years,\u201d Henao describes being taken by Escobar to a ramshackle clinic and lying down on a stretcher while an elderly woman inserted several plastic tubes into her womb. She says she didn\u2019t know she was pregnant and was told it was just a means of pregnancy prevention. Over several days she endured bleeding and intense pain as a pregnancy was aborted. With time, and much therapy, she says she came to view the experience as a \u201cviolation.\u201d\n\nShe writes that she had been \u201cparalyzed\u201d with fear the first time Escobar was intimate with her. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready, I did not feel sexual malice, I did not have the necessary tools to understand what this intimate and intense contact meant,\u201d she says.\n\nTalking of the abortion, something she had kept even from her children until now, she says, \u201cI had to connect with my history and immerse myself in the depths of my soul, to find the courage to reveal the sad secret that I have harbored for 44 years.\u201d\n\nHenao says she decided to break her long silence and write the 523-page book with the hope that younger generations of Colombians would see how much blood has spilled in Colombia as a result of its cocaine business.\n\nBut it is also a page-turner that provides an intimate look at Escobar\u2019s fast evolution from a small-time grave robber to one of the world\u2019s most wanted fugitives.\n\nHenao says she met Escobar when she was 12. She came from an upstanding, traditional family in the Envigado district near Medellin and disobeyed her parents by falling in love with Escobar, the son of a poor watchman who rode around their neighborhood in a flashy Vespa motorcycle and was 11 years her senior.\n\nDuring a courtship that led to marriage when Henao was 15, Escobar showered her with gifts like a yellow bicycle and serenades of romantic ballads.\n\n\u201cHe made me feel like a fairy princess and I was convinced he was my Prince Charming,\u201d she writes.\n\nBut from the start there were long, unexplained absences and he frequently flirted with other women. As Escobar began to amass a fortune, he also became manipulative and paranoid, she says.\n\nHenao insists she was largely kept in the dark about details of his criminal activities and says she escaped from the \u201cinferno\u201d of living alongside Escobar by creating an alternative world devoted to their two children and collecting expensive artworks by the likes of Dali and Rodin.\n\nAfter the Medellin cartel\u2019s 1984 assassination of Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara, Escobar went into hiding and waged a bloody war with the state that included killing a presidential candidate and blowing up a commercial jetliner. Over much of the next decade, until Escobar died during a 1993 rooftop shootout with police, the family\u2019s contact with the kingpin consisted of short visits to safe houses where Henao and her children arrived blindfolded and were escorted by Escobar\u2019s army of assassins.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday with Colombia\u2019s W Radio before the Nov. 15 publication of the book, Henao started off by apologizing to Colombians for what she said was the enormous damage her husband caused the nation. Referring to him throughout the interview as \u201cPablo Escobar,\u201d she said she felt a mix of pain, profound embarrassment and disappointment with the man who had been the love of her life.\n\n\u201cI chose to bear all of this pain to protect my children,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter Escobar was killed, Henao began a frenzied search for asylum, fearing that his many enemies would extract revenge and kill her children. After being turned down by several count they settled in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and changed their names.\n\nThere, an attempt to lead a relatively normal life was interrupted when they were arrested in 1999 for money laundering. They were charged again this year for allegedly helping a Colombian drug trafficker hide money through real estate and a cafe known for its tango performances. Henao denies any wrongdoing and said once again that she and her children are being unfairly targeted because of their former last name.\n\nIn 2009, Escobar\u2019s son, who now goes by the name Sebastian Marroquin, starred in a documentary in which he seeks to atone for his father\u2019s sins by meeting with the orphaned sons of Lara and another prominent victim of his father\u2019s cartel. The film left Colombians transfixed and spurred a more dispassionate look at Escobar\u2019s role in the 1980s and 1990s drug wars.\n\nBut with the proliferation of books, the hit Netflix \u201cNarcos\u201d series, and tours of Escobar\u2019s former haunts in Medellin, some worry that the capo is being glorified by younger Colombians who didn\u2019t live through the bloodbath.\n\nAnd even a quarter century after his death, not everyone is willing to forgive.\n\nWriting recently in the newspaper El Tiempo, popular columnist Maria Isabel Rueda said that Henao\u2019s book \u201cisn\u2019t the excuse of a victim, but of a shameless senora who knew perfectly well that she and her family swam in rivers of gold preceded by a flood of deaths.\u201d\n\n___\n\nJoshua Goodman on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjoshgoodman\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(John Moore/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cCongress very specifically said you can apply for asylum if you arrive in the United States regardless of whether you\u2019re at a port of entry,\u201d said Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project. \u201cThey clearly and explicitly meant to make asylum available to anyone who reaches the United States.\n\n\u201cWe do this because of our obligations under international law and who we are as a country, and what we understand our role to be in terms of protecting people fleeing persecution,\u201d added Jadwat, who said ACLU attorneys have been anticipating the new measures and reviewing legal options. \u201cIf the president doesn\u2019t like what the law says, the way to address it is to get Congress to pass a new one.\u201d\n\n[Why migrant families are seeking asylum at the border in record numbers]\n\nUnder U.S. immigration laws, foreigners who arrive on American soil stating a fear of return can request asylum as a shield against deportation. A U.S. asylum officer then conducts an interview to determine if the person has a \u201ccredible fear\u201d of persecution, in which case the applicant is typically assigned a court date and released from custody.\n\nSoaring numbers of migrants have entered the United States taking this administrative path in recent years, often crossing illegally to turn themselves in to U.S. border agents. Since 2014, asylum claims at the border have increased fourfold, adding to a backlog of more than 750,000 pending cases in U.S. immigration courts.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s new measures would continue to allow foreigners to request asylum if they enter the country legally at U.S. ports of entry, but not those who cross without authorization, administration officials said. Under the changes, migrants who cross illegally would be ineligible for asylum, but they could still be spared from deportation by qualifying for a lesser status known as \u201cwithholding of removal.\u201d\n\nThat does not provide a path to a green card or citizenship, and instead functions as a kind of provisional suspension of the deportation process, revocable at any time. Nonetheless, it would still give those who cross illegally a way to get into the immigration court backlog and be released from custody, especially those who are traveling with children.\n\nQualifying for withholding of removal is generally more difficult, because applicants have to meet a higher standard of proof.\n\nOne senior official said the purpose of the rule change would be to funnel asylum seekers to ports of entry, where the government will have more personnel and resources available to process their claims. But with so many asylum seekers arriving at border crossings in recent months, U.S. customs officers have been limiting the number of people allowed to approach the pedestrian entry lanes, a tactic known as \u201cmetering\u201d that has also triggered challenges in federal court.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection officials defend the practice on the grounds that the border crossings are not equipped to process hundreds of asylum seekers daily, and that officers must continue to facilitate ordinary cross-border travel and trade while protecting the country from terrorists and drug runners.\n\nIt is unclear how many of the migrants traveling in the Central American caravans will approach the ports of entry and attempt to enter legally. In recent weeks the wait at some crossings has stretched to several days or more, and in Tijuana the list of asylum seekers has grown to more than 1,000 people.\n\nThose delays increase the chances that caravan members could attempt to cross illegally by fording the Rio Grande or trekking through the desert to set foot on U.S. soil and surrender to Border Patrol agents.\n\n[Trump administration weighs new family separation measures at border]\n\nSeparately on Thursday, a federal appeals court in California ruled that Trump cannot immediately end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that shields from deportation young immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children or lack permanent legal status. The unanimous decision by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit increases the likelihood that the fate of nearly 700,000 \u201cdreamers\u201d will be settled by the Supreme Court.\n\nTrump said he would allow the program to expire, after Texas and other states threatened to sue to force an end to protections.\n\nThe asylum restrictions announced Thursday will cite executive powers under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the same provision Trump asserted to bar foreigners from certain Muslim-majority countries from coming to the United States under the travel ban. That executive action drew multiple legal challenges and forced the administration to issue three different iterations before a revised version was upheld by the Supreme Court on a 5-to-4 vote in June.\n\nKevin Appleby, a senior director at the Center for Migration Studies in New York, said the announcement amounts to \u201canother example of the Trump administration rewriting the law to discriminate against refugees of color from poor countries. I doubt we would see this rule,\u201d he added, \u201cif it was a group of Norwegians at our border.\u201d\n\nMaria Sacchetti, Felicia Sonmez and Robert Barnes contributed to this report.", "BAGHDAD \u2014 Iraqi security officials say four people have been killed in the first deadly bombing in western Mosul since the city district was recaptured from Islamic State group militants last year.\n\nMosul police officials said the car bomb blast in front of a restaurant in west Mosul on Thursday evening wounded nine others.

And, on top of that, people can walk or ride their bikes or scooters and not have the expense of a car,\u201d he said.\n\nSome cities, such as Phoenix and Orlando, are seeing growth as much from baby boomers seeking a lower cost of living for their retirement as they are from millennials, Kunes said.\n\nGood-paying jobs\n\nBrown and Shuman moved to Atlanta anticipating that they might make less money but that it would still be more affordable. Instead, Brown said, they\u2019re both making more money than they did in Los Angeles, which compounds the benefit of the lower cost of living.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of big companies in Atlanta, like Delta Air Lines and Mailchimp, that pay very well,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIf you have a college degree, it\u2019s pretty easy to get a job here.\u201d\n\nJobs are an important piece of the choice to move.\n\n\u201cOne thing that makes it easier for people to relocate is that there are more remote workers all the time,\u201d Fairweather said. \u201cIf you can live anywhere, it makes more sense to live somewhere that\u2019s less expensive. At the same time, more companies are willing to open offices in other cities to accommodate remote workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the combination of affordable housing and jobs that are causing people to move,\u201d Blomquist said. \u201cIn places like Tampa, Dallas and Las Vegas, there\u2019s a booming economy, with lots of jobs, along with relatively affordable homes. You can cut your housing costs in half if you move to Dallas from Los Angeles and there are jobs there, too.\u201d\n\nNon-farm employment rose the fastest in Florida, at 4.8 percent in September, compared with September 2017, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Employment was up 3.3 percent in Texas, 3.2 percent in Nevada, 2.9 percent in Arizona, 2.5 percent in Georgia and 2.1 percent in Tennessee.\n\n[Hottest areas for millennial renters]\n\nWell-paid science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) jobs are flowing to some secondary locales, such as Denver, Austin, Raleigh-Durham, Nashville and Charlotte, Walter said, especially with start-up companies that want to locate in affordable cities.\n\n\u201cOne of the driving factors in places where STEM jobs are growing is a good relationship between universities and businesses, such as Vanderbilt in Nashville and the University of Texas in Austin,\u201d Walter said. \u201cBusinesses also want to locate in places with higher-than-average population growth, higher-than-average job growth and a lot of younger people starting careers.\u201d\n\nMany of the cities are in the Southeast and Texas, places with a reputation for a simple regulatory system that makes it easier to start a business, Walter said.\n\nSome of the high-growth cities also benefit from a convenient location.\n\n\u201cI can get a direct flight to London, be in New York or Miami in less than two hours, and take a weekend trip to Charleston from Nashville,\u201d Epstein said.\n\nTax advantages also help drive growth in some of these markets. There\u2019s no state income tax in Florida, Nevada, Tennessee or Texas.\n\nMaking adjustments\n\nThe biggest challenge facing secondary cities is how they will handle growth. Home prices have risen rapidly in many of them, so although they are \u201caffordable\u201d cities compared with some coastal markets, they\u2019re far less affordable than in the past, Blomquist said.\n\n[Where you\u2019ll need to earn a six-figure annual salary to buy a median-priced home]\n\n\u201cWe look at affordability in relation to local wages, and we\u2019ve seen that in places such as Clark County in Las Vegas, you now need 44 percent of the average annual wage there to buy a median-priced house, which is much more than in the past,\u201d Blomquist said.\n\nNationwide, average wage-earners would need to spend 37 percent of their income to buy a median-priced home, above the historic national average of 34 percent. But in high-priced markets, such as Kings County (Brooklyn), N.Y., 135 percent of average income is required to buy a median-priced house.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great if you have a place to sell in a high-priced market and move to a lower-priced market, but for long-term residents, rising prices in these secondary cities [are] making them less affordable,\u201d Blomquist said. \u201cIn some markets, like Denver and Dallas, that were \u2018steady Eddie\u2019 markets with relatively stable home prices, we\u2019ve seen home prices rise faster than wages. That means there\u2019s a potential for a bigger downturn unless home price appreciation slows, as it already has in many markets.\u201d\n\nAnother major challenge for many of these cities is the lack of public transit, particularly a rail network.\n\nProposals are in place in Atlanta to build 21 miles of light rail and 18 miles of bus rapid transit lanes, but that can take years to accomplish. In Nashville and Austin, voters in recent years rejected public transit plans because of the increased tax burden required to pay for such systems.\n\nIn Dallas, funding is still an obstacle to plans to expand a downtown subway system and a commuter rail line. City officials there also are looking into streetcars as a traffic solution.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see how these cities handle transit options over the next decade,\u201d Walter said. \u201cSome cities have been proactive and have put in dedicated bus lanes or rail already, and they\u2019ll handle growth better. Cities that don\u2019t address transportation issues will likely see growth slow in future years.\u201d", "FILE - In this Friday, Oct. 19, 2018 file photo, documents and files by Stephen Hawking the personal and academic possessions of Stephen Hawking at the auction house Christies in London.

The mission had put the United States ahead of the Soviet Union in a race to space. America plans to return to the moon as part of a new mission. (NASA via AP)\n\nO n May 25, 1961, President John Kennedy issued a challenge to lawmakers, the new U.S. space agency and the American people.\n\n\u201cI believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth,\u201d Kennedy said in a speech before Congress.\n\nIt was an ambitious goal. But in July 1969, NASA would achieve it. Apollo 11 \u2014 with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin aboard \u2014 landed on the lunar surface and made it back to Earth. This moonshot was no one-shot deal. Astronauts returned to the moon five times for further exploration.\n\nNASA announced this summer that it plans to head back there in the 2020s, about 50 years after astronauts last visited. But this time, the moon isn\u2019t considered a destination. It\u2019s a pit stop on the way to the next space goal: sending humans to Mars. To understand this new era of human spaceflight, it\u2019s important to look back at what Kennedy set in motion 57 years ago.\n\n\n\nEdwin \u201cBuzz\u201d Aldrin stands near the American flag that he and Neil Armstrong planted on the moon during the first moon landing in July 1969.

(NASA via AP)\n\nA proving ground\n\nWhen Kennedy made his plea to Congress, the United States had just launched its first manned spacecraft. Alan Shepard made a 15-minute suborbital flight, traveling 115 miles up and then returning to Earth. The Soviet Union had sent the first man into space several weeks earlier. Not only had Yuri Gagarin\u2019s flight lasted longer \u2014 108 minutes \u2014 but he also completed a single orbit of the Earth. The United States was embarrassed. It didn\u2019t want the Soviets \u2014 the only other world superpower at the time \u2014 to get ahead in space exploration.\n\n\u201cThere was this battle for hearts and minds,\u201d says Teasel Muir-Harmony, space history curator at the Smithsonian National Air & Space Museum. \u201cBeating the Soviets in space was important for the United States\u2019 place in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe footprint of the first man on the moon. (NASA via AP)\n\nThe president had talked with NASA scientists about which achievement was within reach for the United States and perhaps further away for the Soviets.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. at the time was better at landings,\u201d Muir-Harmony said. \u201cThe Soviet Union at the time was having trouble with landings.\u201d\n\nSo they chose landing on the moon, which is on average 240,000 miles away. (The distance changes because its orbit is not a circle.) At that point, Gagarin had traveled the farthest from Earth \u2014 203 miles. Muir-Harmony said Kennedy purposely chose not to aim just one step ahead of the Soviets.\n\n\u201cIf we propose this program that\u2019s really bold . . . they\u2019d have to invest in new technologies,\u201d Muir-Harmony said. Members of Congress would debate spending nearly $1.7 billion on the space program for the next year.\n\nThat money and billions more approved in the 1960s paid not only for the Apollo missions but also rockets and other technology that NASA has used in the decades since then. That, too, was part of Kennedy\u2019s pitch to Congress.\n\n\u201cThis gives promise of some day providing a means for even more exciting and ambitious exploration of space, perhaps beyond the moon, perhaps to the very end of the solar system itself,\u201d he said.\n\nBack and forward\n\nNASA has sent spacecraft to explore the far reaches of our solar system and beyond, but none has included humans. Instead, astronauts have been studying the effects of living and working in space by orbiting Earth, first on Skylab and since 2000 on the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nThe missions have become more collaborative than competitive. NASA has four international partners: space agencies in Russia, Canada, Japan and Europe. More than 100 astronauts and cosmonauts have stayed on the ISS for long-term assignments. And private companies have partnered with NASA to take supplies to the station. Two companies, Boeing and SpaceX, are set to next year become the first private companies to ferry astronauts to the ISS.\n\n\n\nAstronaut Sunita \u201cSuni\u201d Williams trains April 3 in a mock-up of SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon spacecraft in Hawthorne, California.

(SpaceX)\n\nNASA aims to work with these partners and others as it moves toward human missions to Mars. The agency\u2019s leader, Jim Bridenstine, explained in September that the plan to get to Mars involves returning to the moon with landers, rovers, robots and humans.\n\n\u201cThe glory of the moon is that\u2019s it\u2019s only a three-day journey home,\u201d Bridenstine told members of Congress. \u201cSo we can prove all of the technologies, we can reduce all of the risks.\u201d\n\nAnd in the event of an emergency, NASA can get astronauts home quickly, he said. The journey from Mars, which is on average 140 million miles from Earth, would take about eight months.\n\n\n\nChris Ferguson, a former NASA astronaut who now works for Boeing, and Williams practice an emergency escape from the crew access tower at Kennedy Space Center in June.

Despite being one of the administration\u2019s few capable top officials (as retrograde as his agenda was), Sessions had earned Trump\u2019s contempt by recusing himself from the Russia investigation, which, as a member of the 2016 campaign with his own undisclosed contacts with Russian officials, he had no choice but to do.\n\nThe president has said publicly on several occasions that he was shocked and angry to discover that Sessions had a conception of the attorney general\u2019s job that went beyond personal loyalty to Donald Trump.\n\nBy replacing Sessions on an acting basis with his chief of staff, Matthew G. Whitaker, Trump has given us a window into the coming bloodletting. Trump has a much better idea than he did two years ago about what he needs and wants in his underlings, so he has likely shifted his thoughts about personnel. The result will probably be an administration whose pathologies are even worse than they are now, as Trump adapts to a new phase in his presidency that, with Democrats taking over the House, will put him in much greater political peril.\n\nWhitaker is a perfect example of the change. A former U.S. attorney, he has spent the past few years as a far-right activist, starting an organization to hound Democrats with ethics complaints and oppose Democratic judicial nominees after an unsuccessful run for Senate in Iowa in 2014. That year, he ran to the right of the extremely conservative eventual victor Joni Ernst; in one debate, he was asked what his criteria for evaluating judicial nominees would be, and he said, \u201cAre they people of faith? Do they have a biblical view of justice?\u201d\n\nWhitaker has expressed the belief that the courts have virtually no power to constrain the other two branches of government, though his thoughts on this topic are utterly incoherent except insofar as they amount to the principle that whatever outcome conservatives like in any given case is what the Constitution demands.\n\nWhitaker also seems to share with the president a kinship of spirit. He was part of an invention-marketing company that featured a \u201ctime-travel scientist\u201d on its board and was shut down by the Federal Trade Commission after the FTC determined it had scammed inventors out of millions of dollars. It\u2019s already being called \u201cTrump University for inventors.\u201d But most importantly, Whitaker repeatedly criticized the Mueller investigation in print and on TV before joining the administration.\n\nThat, more than anything else, is surely what convinced Trump that Whitaker would be his guy \u2014 and nothing is more important to Trump. The things Sessions was doing as attorney general, such as cracking down on immigrants and restarting the war on drugs, were all well and good. But especially now with Democrats holding a house of Congress from which they can restrain and bedevil the president, personal loyalty is the highest consideration.\n\nThis was always important to Trump, but at first he may not have realized that he couldn\u2019t necessarily count on everyone around him to make it their top priority. Faced with the daunting task of filling thousands of positions in his new administration, Trump exercised only minimal oversight on the process, mostly farming it out to others. Apart from installing a few cronies here and there, he allowed allies and aides to populate the executive branch with Republicans who could be counted on to pursue the party\u2019s agenda. While candidates were screened for disloyalty and often excluded from consideration if they had spoken ill of the president during the primaries, there wasn\u2019t necessarily a requirement that they be enthusiastic Trumpites so much as that they couldn\u2019t have demonstrated any antipathy toward him.\n\nBut because so many conservative policy wonks and professionals didn\u2019t want to stain their reputations by working for Trump, the Republican barrel had to be scraped to its bottom to find enough people to fill out the ranks, leading to an administration that has been populated by the incompetent, the buffoonish and the corrupt. Trump usually acted as though as long as you didn\u2019t oppose him directly or do anything to embarrass him, he didn\u2019t much care how you went about your business.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s attention is now focused on self-preservation. With his reelection campaign looming and Democrats in possession of subpoena power, more than ever before he\u2019ll want to be assured that he\u2019s surrounded by people who have no higher purpose than protecting him. Now he\u2019ll be looking at everyone who works for him and asking, Is there anything this person cares about more than protecting me? If the answer is yes, they won\u2019t last long.\n\nOf course, not every corner of the administration is the same \u2014 I\u2019m sure Trump neither knows nor cares who the deputy undersecretary of agriculture is. Much of his attention is going to focus on the Justice Department, because by its nature law enforcement is a threat to him. But if I worked in the administration, I\u2019d be updating my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 just in case, or maybe drafting some op-eds about how Donald Trump is the most perfect human being to have ever walked the Earth.

Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts President Joel Wachs described the requirement as \u201ca direct threat\u201d to those who produce challenging work.\n\n\u201cThe DCCAH\u2019s revised language defies the First Amendment, censoring artistic freedom in the city in which we live and make our art.

Six suspected Bangladeshi traffickers were also arrested while the rescued refugees were sent back to their camps in the district, he said.\n\nDas said they were lured by the traffickers with promises of marriages and jobs in Malaysia.\n\nHe said the rescued refugees told them they paid money to the traffickers who said they would soon land in Malaysia amid fears that they would have no future in Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state if they are sent back.\n\n\u201cI paid 10,000 takas ($120) to a Rohingya man who told me he will send me to Malaysia.

Many in Myanmar ridicule them as \u201cBengalis\u201d who came from Bangladesh.\n\nThe refugees are seeking U.N. protection to return home. The U.N. refugee agency and Bangladesh had earlier finalized a memorandum of understanding that said the repatriation process must be \u201csafe, voluntary and dignified ... in line with international standards.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nOpinion writer\n\nDemocrats had to win one policy argument to take the House and another to provide a pathway to future electoral victories. They did both, which should remind Democrats and Republicans alike that while President Trump\u2019s ranting and raving can carry deep red senators over the finish line, he\u2019s ceding important issues to Democrats.\n\nIt was essential for Democrats to defend their most significant legislative accomplishment in decades \u2014 the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and staunch GOP efforts to uproot it. They ably focused on Obamacare, especially protection for those with preexisting conditions, and wiped out a slew of Republicans who had pledged to repeal Obamacare. What\u2019s more, in three red states \u2014 Idaho, Nebraska and Utah \u2014 voters approved Medicaid expansion, a central element of the ACA. It\u2019s remarkable that with control of both houses of Congress and the White House, Republicans wound up popularizing the health-care law \u2014 and expanding an entitlement program they\u2019ve attacked for decades as rife with waste, fraud and abuse.\n\nMoreover, as the New York Times reports: \u201cDemocratic victories in governors\u2019 races also improved the chances of Medicaid expansion in Kansas and Wisconsin, and all but ensured it in Maine. As a result, Medicaid could see its biggest enrollment bump since the health law began allowing expansion in 2014 . . . Another state to keep an eye on is North Carolina, where Republicans lost their supermajority in the state House and Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, has been trying to build support for Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nThe ACA, it seems, is here to stay because even Republicans want its benefits. The task is to improve and strengthen it with an eye toward affordability. (The only comparable policy win I can think of is same-sex marriage \u2014 which is effectively a nonissue.) The era of Republicans pretending to be small-government advocates is over (especially considering their infatuation with debt). If the argument is who is going to do a better job of providing health care, Democrats have a substantial advantage. (If the ACA is \u201csocialism,\u201d as Trump and other Republicans try to argue, I suppose red-state voters are socialists.)\n\nEqually if not more important for future electoral victories were Democratic wins in the area of voting rights. Ironically in an election in which Georgia gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp (R) pulled every trick in the book (voter purges, exact match rules, closing polling places) to suppress the vote, the 2018 midterms marked a big step forward to voting access. Progressives were ecstatic. Mother Jones crowed:\n\nFlorida passed a historic ballot initiative that will restore voting rights to up to 1.4 million ex-felons. Voters in Michigan dramatically modernized their election system by approving Election Day registration, automatic registration, no-excuse absentee ballots, and straight-ticket voting. Nevada passed automatic registration, and Maryland adopted Election Day registration. These measures will make it easier for tens of thousands of people to register in these states. In addition, Michigan, Colorado, and Missouri approved initiatives to rein in gerrymandering by drawing political districts in a nonpartisan way. All of these initiatives received at least 60 percent of the vote, reflecting broad support for a pro-voting rights agenda. (A seventh initiative, to create an independent redistricting commission in Utah, was narrowly ahead with 50 percent of the vote as of Wednesday morning, but it remains too close to call until all the mail-in ballots are counted.) \u201cIt\u2019s a reaffirmation that voting rights are popular,\u201d says Faiz Shakir, political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which put a combined $10 million behind initiatives in Florida, Michigan, Nevada, and Utah.\n\nThese measures will help make voter ID and other voting-suppression stratagems a dead letter. The limits on gerrymandering, which were approved in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision earlier this year to punt on the issue, will theoretically open up more state and federal seats to competition and increase minority voting power (since gerrymandering in red states often serves to limit nonwhites\u2019 voting power).\n\nPutting aside any partisan advantage, increasing access to voting and creating more seats that are competitive are indisputably pro-democracy measures. Forcing more politicians to be responsive to more voters is the essence of democracy.\n\nThere were setbacks for advocates of voting reform in Arkansas and North Carolina, which passed voter ID measures, but overall this was the biggest comeback for voting rights since the Supreme Court struck down pre-clearance provisions in the Voting Rights Act in 2013.\n\nStates that elected Democratic governors and legislatures should follow the example in states that did not pass voting-access ballot measures. They can legislatively enact automatic registration, voting by mail and anti-gerrymandering measures.\n\nFor too long, Republicans have been extending the dominance of white voters through a variety of voting schemes. In 2018, voting-rights advocates began fighting back. If they are successful, Republicans might actually have to start appealing to nonwhite voters.", "A man stands at the scene of a bus crash in Rusape about 170 kilomertes east of the capital Harare, Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018.

The lengthy lineup reflects two frustrating years for Democrats who have repeatedly sent letters imploring the White House to answer their questions, to no avail.\n\nTrump has said he would adopt a \u201cwarlike posture\u201d if Democrats on several committees in the House forge ahead with plans to investigate him and his administration. A Democratic aide replied that the Foreign Affairs Committee would do its job and exercise its oversight authority, \u201cone way or another.\u201d\n\nTo a large degree, oversight on foreign policy presents Democrats with as many limitations as responsibilities. The executive branch runs foreign policy, while Congress controls the purse strings.\n\nWhat a Democratic-controlled House can do is set the stage for 2020, making the case that Democrats are better at foreign policy and national security than Republicans.\n\n\u201cIt's all about framing for 2020,\u201d said Joel Rubin, who was the State Department\u2019s liaison to the House during the Obama administration. \u201cSo much of what the House can do is not through writing a bill that will have to be agreed to by the Senate and signed by the president. It\u2019s about clarifying differences and highlighting them.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 wish list includes hearings advancing alternatives to White House policies on climate change, refugees and migration, according to a Democratic aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the plans more frankly.\n\nThey want to find out what Trump said to Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin at a July meeting in Helsinki unattended by any White House aides, and what he told North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un when they met with only interpreters present during a June summit in Singapore. They intend to explore his business relationships in foreign countries and possible conflicts of interest with Russians.\n\nThey have oversight responsibility over the State Department and plan to use it by delving into whether dozens of career diplomats have been pushed out because they were not considered Trump loyalists.\n\nSeveral committee members have articulated tougher positions than the White House on Russia, North Korea and Saudi Arabia and urged congressional authorization on military engagement in hot spots such as Syria.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long agenda,\u201d the Democratic aide said.\n\nMany of the issues already have been put forward by Rep. Eliot L. Engel (N.Y.), the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nAs the ranking Democrat, Engel has issued a steady stream of barbed commentary over Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 among them, withdrawing from the nuclear deal with Iran and weapons treaties with Russia, threatening to withhold aid to several Central American countries, slashing refu\u00adgee admissions and support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.\n\nBut there is little the Engel-led committee could do to reverse some policy decisions, including the U.S. pullout from the nuclear deal with Iran and hundreds of sanctions measures.\n\nForeign assistance enjoys bipartisan support, and Congress has already rejected two sizable budget cuts proposed by the Trump administration.\n\nThe ability for Democrats to make their voices heard on foreign policy may be the most potent weapon they have.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of noise, a lot of heat and a lot of light shed on Trump\u2019s foreign policy,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a former State Department official who is a scholar at the Wilson Center. \u201cThe real question is how consequential it is going to be. On foreign policy, the administration has tremendous advantages by virtue of what the Constitution says.\u201d\n\nMiller said any Democratic emphasis on the administration\u2019s perceived foreign policy failures is likely to fade away as domestic concerns rise to the fore. For example, he said, few will focus on foreign policy if special counsel Robert S. Mueller III does not get fired in the three months before the new Congress begins, and he hands in a report raising questions about Russian influence in the Trump campaign.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not the Mueller report, the focus will be redistricting or campaign finance reform,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to identify discrete issues on which to focus.

(Charlie Neibergall/AP)\n\nActing attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker has no intention of recusing himself from overseeing the special-counsel probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election, according to people close to him who added they do not believe he would approve any subpoena of President Trump as part of that investigation.\n\nSince stepping into his new role Wednesday, Whitaker has faced questions \u2014 principally from Democrats \u2014 about whether he should recuse himself from the Russia investigation, given that he has written opinion pieces about the investigation and is a friend and political ally of a grand jury witness.\n\nOn Thursday, two people close to Whitaker said he does not plan to take himself off the Russia case. They also said he is deeply skeptical of any effort to force the president\u2019s testimony through a subpoena.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert S. Mueller III has been negotiating for months with Trump\u2019s attorneys over the terms of a possible interview of the president. Central to those discussions has been the idea that Mueller could, if negotiations failed, subpoena the president. If Whitaker were to take the threat of a subpoena off the table, that could alter the equilibrium between the two sides and significantly reduce the chances that the president ever sits for an interview.\n\nAt the Justice Department, ethics officials typically review the past work of senior leaders to see whether they have any financial or personal conflicts that would preclude them from overseeing particular cases.\n\nIn the past, senior Justice Department officials have tended to follow such advice, but they are rarely required to do so, according to officials familiar with the process.\n\n\u201cThe consistent tradition, through administrations of both political parties, has been for DOJ\u2019s senior leaders to consult career ethics officials on questions of recusal,\u201d said Matthew Axelrod, a senior department official during the Obama administration. \u201cHere, to avoid irreparable damage to the institution\u2019s integrity, it is crucial that the normal process be followed.\u201d\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. Officials there have said Whitaker will follow the regular procedure in handling any ethics issues that arise.\n\nOn Thursday evening, Democratic attorneys general for 17 states and the District wrote to Whitaker urging him to recuse himself from the Russia probe.\n\n\u201cAs chief law enforcement officers of our respective states, we ask that you recuse yourself from any role in overseeing Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election,\u201d the Democratic attorneys general wrote. \u201cBecause a reasonable person could question your impartiality in the matter, your recusal is necessary to maintain public trust in the integrity of the investigation and to protect the essential and longstanding independence of the Department you have been chosen to lead, on an acting basis.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Whitaker chaired the campaign of Sam Clovis, a Republican candidate for Iowa state treasurer. Clovis went on to work as a Trump campaign adviser and has become a witness in the investigation by Mueller.\n\nThe Justice Department advises employees that \u201cgenerally, an employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any matter in which her impartiality could be questioned.\u201d Regulations prohibit employees, \u201cwithout written authorization, from participating in a criminal investigation or prosecution if he has a personal or political relationship with any person or organization substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of the investigation or prosecution.\u201d\n\n[Sessions\u2019s ouster throws future of special-counsel probe into question]\n\nClovis said Wednesday that Whitaker is a friend and that he texted congratulations to Whitaker on Wednesday after he became attorney general. The question for ethics officials, if they are asked, would be whether Clovis would be considered \u201csubstantially involved\u201d in the conduct Mueller is investigating.\n\nOn the issue of his opinion columns, Whitaker could argue that he took positions before he knew the full factual and legal circumstances of the case and therefore there is no need for recusal. It is possible ethics officials could still advise him that his commentary created the appearance of a conflict of interest but leave the decision to him. If they recommended forcefully that he recuse himself and he declined, Whitaker could then be referred to the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility, and his license to practice law could be put at issue.\n\nThe White House is unconcerned about Whitaker\u2019s previous comments, a senior White House official said. He was at the White House on Thursday afternoon for a meeting on immigration.\n\nTrump is aware that Whitaker has been critical of the Russia probe, this official said, adding that Whitaker\u2019s comments align with the president\u2019s position.\n\nIt is unlikely that Whitaker will get the job permanently, this official said.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s elevation to become the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official followed the ouster Wednesday of Jeff Sessions as attorney general. Sessions had endured months of public abuse from Trump, who soured on Sessions because he recused himself from oversight of the Russia investigation shortly after he arrived at the Justice Department.\n\nSessions felt that Mueller\u2019s investigation had gone on too long but also believed it was important that he stay on as attorney general as a means of protecting the special counsel\u2019s work, so that when it concluded, the public would have confidence it had not been manipulated, according to a person familiar with Sessions\u2019s thinking.\n\nEven after he arrived at the Justice Department, Whitaker harbored frustration about the length of the special-counsel probe and doubts about the scope of Mueller\u2019s authority, a person familiar with the matter said. He questioned Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein\u2019s ability to give Mueller such wide latitude and wanted to explore the bounds of what Mueller was examining, though Rosenstein kept Sessions\u2019s office \u201cwalled off\u201d from the matter, this person said. Whitaker did, however, believe that Sessions had no choice but to recuse himself from the matter, the person said.\n\n[\u2018A biblical view of justice\u2019: Whitaker once said judges shouldn\u2019t have a secular worldview]\n\nRosenstein and Whitaker have come to eye each other warily in recent months, people familiar with the matter said. When Rosenstein was nearly ousted from his post over reports that he had suggested surreptitiously recording the president, Whitaker was tapped to take over Rosenstein\u2019s position. But after a visit to the White House, Rosenstein stayed in his job, leaving people across the Justice Department \u2014 Whitaker included \u2014 mystified as to what happened, these people said.\n\nRosenstein and Whitaker both were present at the investiture of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh on Thursday \u2014 Whitaker dressed in a \u201cmorning suit,\u201d which included formal trousers, a vest and a long coat, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nWhile Whitaker is now Mueller\u2019s ultimate supervisor, it was not immediately clear whether that meant Rosenstein would step aside. Justice Department officials said that under normal circumstances, the deputy attorney general would probably play an active, hands-on role in overseeing such a high-profile probe and that they had no reason to believe Rosenstein would now be cut out.\n\nWhitaker was virtually unknown to Sessions before becoming his chief of staff, though Federalist Society Executive President Leonard Leo had been touting the former U.S. attorney from Iowa as early as the transition, according to a person familiar with the matter. Leo had come to know Whitaker because both were prominent in conservative legal circles and he considered Whitaker a true conservative and talented manager, this person said.\n\nInitially, Sessions chose Jody Hunt, a longtime Justice Department official, to be the top aide in his office, while Whitaker made a name for himself in Washington via TV appearances and his work with the conservative Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust.\n\nWhile liked by Sessions, Hunt clashed with Danielle Cutrona, another aide in the attorney general\u2019s office, in such a way that those around Sessions came to feel one or the other would have to move on, according to people familiar with the matter. Early in the administration, Hunt was offered a more prestigious position \u2014 running the Justice Department\u2019s civil division. Leo then recommended Whitaker to Cutrona, in part hoping he might help improve the Justice Department\u2019s relationship with the White House, and Cutrona passed on the recommendation to Sessions, the people said.\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman, speaking for Hunt and Cutrona, disputed that Hunt left as chief of staff because of Cutrona and that Whitaker\u2019s coming on board was tied directly to Hunt\u2019s departure.\n\n\u201cBoth parties involved in your story deny this happened,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\n\nSessions brought Whitaker in for an interview and came to like him, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nAs chief of staff, Whitaker was a hard-charging aide, imposing on the Justice Department his personal philosophy of starting with the end in mind, according to those who have worked with him. His style rubbed many the wrong way, and at times Justice Department officials pushed back on his demands. Department officials said his taking over the top job from his boss was, at the very least, awkward, because chiefs of staff typically leave with the attorney general.\n\nTrump many weeks ago talked with Whitaker about replacing Sessions as the attorney general, and Sessions was surprised when the discussion was reported in The Washington Post and felt it left his relationship with Whitaker bruised, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Sessions gathered dozens of top Justice Department officials in the attorney general\u2019s conference room, according to a person familiar with the matter. He talked about loving the job and framed his removal as something that happens to every attorney general, the person said. He also said he thought Whitaker would carry the torch, the person said.\n\nIn a note sent to the Justice Department staff on Thursday, Sessions wrote, \u201cNo matter what your role at the Department and no matter what your task, I hope that you will remember that you are helping us in our mission to protect the American people and the rights we hold dear.\u201d\n\nSari Horwitz contributed to this report.", "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) vowed Thursday to fight for \u201cbipartisan, commonsense solutions to prevent gun violence\u201d in the wake of the shooting of a dozen people inside a crowded country-music bar late Wednesday in Southern California.\n\nPelosi\u2019s comments were echoed Thursday by other Democrats as they prepared to take control of the House next year, bolstering the prospects for passage of gun-control measures.

(Peter Dejong/Associated Press)\n\nUTRECHT, Netherlands \u2014 Self-styled positivity guru Emile Ratelband thinks age is just a number. And his is a number the Dutchman wants changed.\n\nThe 69-year-old TV personality has asked a court in the Netherlands to approve his request for a new birthday that officially would make him 49.\n\nRatelband says his legal appeal is consistent with other forms of personal transformation that are gaining acceptance and government recognition in the Netherlands and around the world.\n\n\u201cWith this free(dom) of choice, choice of name, freeness of gender, I want to have my own age. I want to control myself,\u201d he said Thursday.\n\nRatelband says he wants to avoid age discrimination in society \u2014 especially on dating websites.\n\n\u201cSo when I ask for a mortgage, for example, they say it\u2019s impossible,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cIf I go on Tinder, then I get women from 68, 69 when women are there.\u201d\n\nHow about just being economical with the truth about his age?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to lie,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be myself, so don\u2019t force me to lie.\u201d\n\nMarjolein van den Brink, who specializes in human rights and gender issues at Utrecht University\u2019s law school, said age discrimination is a problem but is different than the issues involved in reassigning gender.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that elderly people have a much smaller chance of getting a job than younger people,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that\u2019s just one element and it\u2019s only something that happens to you once you reach the age of 40, 45, 50, depending a bit on your job.\n\n\u201cWhereas gender is something that follows you from birth to grave, and it determines nearly everything \u2014 and not just in the labor market but everywhere,\u201d she said.\n\nIn rare cases, even race has also become more fluid.\n\nIn Britain, theater director Anthony Ekundayo Lennon has attracted attention in part because despite being the son of white Irish parents, he looks like a mixed-race man. He has also written and told journalists that he thinks of himself as black.\n\nHe says he was racially abused as a teenager because of his appearance, and when he started an acting career, he found it easier to pursue non-white parts. He also took an African middle name.\n\nNow some black artists are complaining because Lennon was recently given a paid traineeship in a program designed to give more black people a chance for careers in the arts.\n\nHis case resembles in some ways that of Rachel Dolezal, a white woman in the United States who identified herself as black after she was raised by religious parents who had adopted four black children.

He said he\u2019d be happy to forfeit his monthly pension of around 1,200 euros ($1,370) \u2014 a concession he estimates would save nearly 300,000 euros ($343,000) over the 20 years he wants shaved off his age.\n\nThe court in the central city of Arnhem is expected to issue a ruling in about four weeks.\n\nRatelband, who makes a living urging people and businesses to be positive, denies that the age request is a publicity stunt.

Stock says that the international police organization\u2019s rules forbid him from probing the fate of the man who served as Interpol president until two months ago when he vanished on a trip to China, his homeland. (Laurent Cipriani/Associated Press)\n\nLYON, France \u2014 Interpol\u2019s secretary general said Thursday that the international police organization\u2019s rules forbid him from probing into the fate of the Chinese government official who served as Interpol president for almost two years before he vanished during a trip to China.\n\nIn his first public remarks about the disappearance of Meng Hongwei, Interpol Secretary General Juergen Stock said he \u201cencouraged\u201d Chinese authorities to provide information about Meng\u2019s location and legal status but can do no more.\n\nStock spoke to journalists as Interpol member prepare to elect a new president to replace Meng during a general assembly in Dubai on Nov. 18-21. Meng became the organization\u2019s president in November 2016.\n\nChinese authorities said they detained Meng, 64, on bribery charges, though his wife has described him as a victim of political persecution. He was China\u2019s vice minister of public security and appears to be the latest ranking Chinese official to have been caught in a sweeping purge under President Xi Jinping.\n\nStock said his organization learned of Meng\u2019s disappearance on Oct. 5 via media reports that came out after Meng\u2019s wife said she had not heard from him since the end of September and reported him missing.\n\nInterpol contacted Beijing, asking for clarification, according to Stock. A high-level Chinese delegation arrived at Interpol\u2019s Lyon headquarters on Oct. 7, reported that Meng had written a resignation letter and advised that he was no longer a delegate from China to Interpol \u2014 meaning he could no longer serve as president.\n\nChina\u2019s Interpol office transmitted the resignation letter to Interpol headquarters later that day. Pressed on whether Interpol had assurances Meng actually wrote it or did so without duress, Stock hedged.\n\n\u201cThere was no reason for me to (suspect) that anything was forced or wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nInterpol appeared to accept the Chinese delegation\u2019s explanation at face value and publicly announced that night that Meng had stepped down, without commenting on why or what happened.\n\nStock cited the structure and nature of the 192-member organization, which provides a platform for member nations to share information on criminal activities, and the vast needs it fulfills in trying to contain ballooning transnational crime. Interpol databases are queried 200 times each second by police around the world, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are a rules-based organization. That is very important to understand,\u201d Stock said, adding that the role of Interpol is \u201cnot to govern over member states.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not an investigative body,\u201d he said.\n\nStock said he is in \u201cconstant\u201d contact with the national central bureau in Beijing that serves as Interpol\u2019s point of contact in China. As secretary general, Stock manages Interpol\u2019s day-to-day activities, while the agency\u2019s elected president has a less hands-on, more symbolic role.\n\n\u201cWe are strongly encouraging China\u201d to come forth with details of Meng\u2019s case, Stock said. He suggested Chinese officials would \u201cwhen the right moment comes.\u201d\n\nMeng\u2019s wife, Grace Meng, told The Associated Press last month that she received threats after her husband disappeared. She and their two children are under police protection in Lyon.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt this is a very regrettable situation,\u201d Stock said. \u201cBut on the other hand, we have to ensure day-to-day operations ... continue.\u201d\n\nHe also conceded that Interpol must \u201cmitigate negative impact\u201d springing from Meng\u2019s disappearance.\n\nInterpol acts as a clearinghouse for national police services that want to hunt down suspects outside their borders. Governments have repeatedly tried to use Interpol to find political enemies, even though its charter explicitly proclaims its neutrality and prohibits use of police notices for political reasons.\n\nStock said that ensuring the notices are not misused has been one of his priorities.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He can also be a grandstander who seems to thrive on conflict with President Trump and doesn\u2019t always know when to stop his aggressive questioning.\n\nBut whether you like Acosta\u2019s style, it\u2019s clear the White House crossed a bright line Wednesday when it took away Acosta\u2019s \u201chard pass,\u201d which allows him the access he needs to cover the White House.\n\n[White House suspends press pass of CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta after his testy exchange with Trump]\n\nThat action amounts to punishing a member of the press for doing his job of informing the public \u2014 and then creating a false pretext to justify that relatiation.\n\nTrump\u2019s dislike of Acosta is well known, and he took it to a new level at a wild news conference Wednesday, calling him \u201ca rude, terrible person\u201d whom CNN should be ashamed of employing.\n\nTo make matters worse, Sarah Sanders lied \u2014 and circulated a misleadingly edited video to back herself up \u2014 when she claimed later that Acosta was being punished for \u201cplacing his hands on a young woman.\u201d\n\nA White House staff member was directed to take a mic out of Acosta\u2019s hands; he certainly didn\u2019t readily give it up but he was polite, and he came into physical contact with her only for a brief moment as he moved his arm to shield the mic.\n\nI\u2019ve heard various suggestions about how CNN or the press corps should respond to this retaliation: There should be a boycott, a walkout, a news blackout. And I\u2019ve read the strongly worded rebukes from the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, from CNN and others.\n\nBut mere words aren\u2019t enough. And a boycott or blackout not only runs counter to the core idea that the reporters are there to inform the public, but it also would cede the briefings to the worst Trump sycophants.\n\nNo, something more is called for: CNN should sue the Trump White House on First Amendment grounds. And press-rights groups, along with other media organizations, should join in to create a united and powerful front. (Fox News, which benefited from the press corps\u2019 united front on its behalf when the Obama White House tried to exclude it from some briefings in 2009, should pay that solidarity forward by getting on board.)\n\n\u201cThis merits a forceful response, and a lawsuit would be reasonable,\u201d said Jonathan Peters, a media-law professor who teaches at the University of Georgia Law School and is the press freedom correspondent for Columbia Journalism Review.\n\nHe told me by email that the stated rationale for revoking the pass \u201cwas clearly a sham,\u201d and the White House should be held accountable.\n\n\u201cNothing educates the government so much as a damage award,\u201d he said. (The claim, he said, would probably take the form of an action under a statute that authorizes suits against government actors for, among other things, a deprivation of First Amendment rights.)\n\nThe legal question, he said, may be whether a journalist has a First Amendment right of access to information or places closed to the public but open generally to press \u2014 and some lower courts have said yes. (In Sherrill v. Knight, the D.C. Circuit Court ruled in 1977 that a reporter for the Nation shouldn\u2019t have been denied a White House press pass.)\n\nBruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, told me Thursday that CNN \u201cnow has a legitimate claim that there\u2019s been retaliation \u2014 a line has been crossed here.\u201d\n\nHis organization \u201cabsolutely\u201d would support such an effort, he said, and suggested a larger framing might be wise \u2014 one that includes the Trump Justice Department\u2019s efforts, now before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, to undo the $85 billion merger between AT&T and Time Warner, which is CNN\u2019s parent company.\n\nGranted, a suit is far from a perfect solution. It wouldn\u2019t solve Acosta\u2019s immediate problem, and it might take months or even years to be resolved.\n\nIt also feeds the kind of anti-media controversy Trump loves to generate, and which benefits him politically.\n\nAnd because a suit would generate news coverage, it would distract from important issues like Trump\u2019s putting a loyalist in the office of attorney general after firing Jeff Sessions.\n\nNone of that is good.\n\nBut far, far worse is letting a bullying White House get away with retaliating against the press and then lying about it.\n\nFor more by Margaret Sullivan visit wapo.st/sullivan", "\n\nVenezuelan migrants stand along a roadside after leaving a migrant care center in Tumbes, Peru, near the border with Ecuador, on Nov. 1. Only Venezuelan citizens who entered Peru by Oct. 31 were eligible to obtain temporary residence permits. (Juan Vita/AFP)\n\nA new U.N. estimate has found that the number of people who have fled Venezuela in the country\u2019s economic collapse and political chaos since 2015 has reached 3 million \u2014 marking an exodus comparable to the ones seen in war-ravaged countries such as Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nThe estimate was compiled by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the U.N. refugee agency, and the International Organization for Migration, the U.N. migration agency. The agencies say it includes both refugees and migrants and was estimated using data from national migration authorities in the region.\n\nThe scale of the number of people leaving the country makes it comparable to some of the world\u2019s most severe refugee crises in recent years. According to estimates from UNHCR, there were 6.3 million refugees from Syria at the end of 2017, which was the worst refugee crisis in the world, followed by 2.6 million from Afghanistan and 2.4 million from South Sudan, another country recently afflicted by war.\n\nWilliam Spindler, a spokesman for UNHCR, said that although most Venezuelans were not fleeing the sort of armed conflict seen in Syria or Afghanistan, they could be considered refugees under the Cartagena Declaration on Refugees, a nonbinding agreement signed by 14 Latin American countries in 1984.\n\n\u201cVenezuelans are leaving their country for a combination of reasons, including insecurity and violence, lack of access to food, medicine and essential services, as well as loss of income and lack of effective national protection systems as a result of the current political and socioeconomic situation,\u201d Spindler said.\n\n\u201cUNHCR believes that these circumstances fall under the spirit of the Cartagena Declaration that extends the refugee definition to include \u2018persons who have fled their country because their lives, safety or freedom have been threatened by generalized violence, foreign aggression, internal conflicts, massive violation of human rights or other circumstances which have seriously disturbed public order,\u2019 \" he said.\n\nThe refugees and migrants from Venezuela have ended up spread unevenly throughout the region, according to the estimate. Venezuela\u2019s neighbor Colombia hosted more than 1 million. It was followed by Peru, which had more than half a million; Ecuador, with more than 220,000; Argentina, 130,000; Chile, more than 100,000; and Brazil, 85,000. Countries in Central America and the Caribbean are also hosting large numbers of Venezuelans, the report estimated.\n\nAt least some have made their way to the United States. Data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services showed a surge of 88 percent in the number of Venezuelans applying for asylum in 2017, with the number totaling 27,629 by the end of the year. Those who make it to the United States are generally better off financially.\n\nThe scale of the problem is likely to require more international coordination, said Eduardo Stein, the UNHCR-IOM joint special representative for refugees and migrants from Venezuela.\n\n\u201cCountries in Latin America and the Caribbean have largely maintained a commendable open-door policy to refugees and migrants from Venezuela; however, their reception capacity is severely strained, requiring a more robust and immediate response from the international community if this generosity and solidarity are to continue,\u201d Stein said.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem that seems to be getting worse. \u201cAccording to official data from national migration authorities, the flow of people leaving Venezuela has increased in the last six months,\u201d Spindler said.\n\nThe Venezuelan economy has collapsed since oil prices dropped in 2010, and critics say that the economic policies of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his immediate predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, have made the crisis far worse. A report released by the country\u2019s opposition-held Congress on Wednesday estimated that inflation had hit 833,997 percent in October.\n\nMaduro has blamed an \u201ceconomic war\u201d waged by the United States and other \u201cimperialist\u201d countries for the nation\u2019s economic problems.\n\nRead more:\n\nVenezuela hopes to tackle the world\u2019s worst inflation by deleting zeros from its currency\n\nThe many problems with Trump\u2019s reported idea of invading Venezuela\n\nAngry Venezuelans tell Maduro they\u2019d rather clean America\u2019s toilets than stay in their country", "Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev attends the Moscow premier of a film made by Werner Herzog and British filmmaker Andre Singer based on their conversations, in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018.

(Brynn Anderson/Associated Press)\n\nFlorida voters overwhelmingly came down on the side of dogs Tuesday, voting to ban greyhound racing in the state, a decision that puts in question the future of thousands of racing dogs.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Dogs called Amendment 13, which was approved by 69 percent of voters this week, \u201ca knockout blow to a cruel industry that has been hurting and killing dogs for nearly a century.\u201d Florida hosts 11 of the 17 active dog tracks in the United States, but the industry will be shuttered in the state by January 2021, meaning some 6,000 dogs will need new homes.\n\n\u201cBecause of the decisions of millions of Florida voters, thousands of dogs will be spared the pain and suffering that is inherent in the greyhound racing industry,\u201d Kitty Block, the acting president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, told the Orlando Sentinel. \u201cWe are so grateful to the volunteers, campaign members, coalition partners, contributors and endorsers who came together in support of this historic effort to end the cruelty of greyhound racing.\u201d\n\nTrainers and racetrack workers are among those who will be put out of work by the decision, but greyhound racing has long been criticized for reported abuse of dogs, who are often neglected and subjected to cruel conditions. Now, the task for advocacy organizations and adoption groups is to find homes for the dogs, most of whom race until they around 2 years old.\n\nAdopt-a-Greyhound.org points out that the dogs can make great pets. Trained to chase lures that most often are mechanical, the racing dogs are neither vicious nor predatory. They are sociable and accustomed to being around people because they\u2019ve been handled by trainers, veterinarians and dog walkers as well as children.\n\n\n\nSonia Stratemann of West Palm Beach, Fla., has adopted two former greyhound racers. (Brynn Anderson/Associated Press)\n\n\u201cThere are groups already mobilizing in other states,\u201d Kate MacFall, Florida state director of the Humane Society of the United States, told USA Today. \u201cWe see this as an incredible opportunity to find homes.\u201d\n\n\"This is the most historic event for greyhound advocacy and adoption in the world at any time,\u201d Christine Dorchak, the president and general counsel of GREY2K USA Worldwide, told the Miami Herald.\n\nThe Amendment 13 fight had attracted powerful figures on both sides, with Grey2K USA, the largest greyhound protection organization in the world, pitted against racing proponents such as NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer. Also aligned with the amendment were Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and Lara Trump, daughter-in-law of the president.\n\n\u201cThis is a black eye on our state,\u201d Bondi had said.\n\nGroups including the HSUS and celebrities such as Doris Day, a longtime animal rights activist, raised $2.5 million to lobby for the ban, The Post reported this summer, while greyhound racing supporters had raised only $24,000 to defend it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get squashed,\u201d Norm Rader, a greyhound trainer, said ahead of the vote. \u201cIt\u2019s a David and Goliath fight. They\u2019re going to overpower us with TV commercials. We can\u2019t dispute the lies they\u2019re telling about us.\u201d\n\nThe industry was targeted, Rader and others argued, because horse racing is too moneyed to take down.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s too much money there, so they\u2019re coming after us. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do or how I\u2019ll survive,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring the run-up to the election, each side accused the other of lies and exaggerations. Florida records cited by The Post in August showed 483 greyhounds had died on the track or in kennel properties since 2013, with most deaths directly related to racing. Causes of death included broken necks, heart attacks or electrocution from the high-voltage lures that lead the dogs around the tracks. The industry also has been marred by doping allegations, although trainers typically have disputed such accusations.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be unhealthy and run around a track in half a minute,\u201d A.J. Grant, a trainer in Orlando who cares for 120 greyhounds with the help of four assistants, told The Post. \u201cMy dogs are athletes. They get . . . meat that could go into a burger patty. I give them Big Macs as treats. They\u2019re treated like kings.\"\n\nSoon, though, the industry will be closed down as the focus turns to finding new homes for the dogs.\n\n\u201cEverything for years has been about gambling and expansion, and the dogs were just stuck in the middle,\u201d Sonia Stratemann, vice chairwoman of Protect Dogs-Yes to 13, told USA Today. \u201cVoters have shown how they feel.\u201d\n\nNow, it\u2019s dog lovers' turn.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAlabama fan dies from injuries sustained in bar fight after LSU game\n\n\u2018Harper\u2019s bazaar has begun,\u2019 and so has the Scott Boras Show\n\nESPN\u2019s Stephen A.

The government cannot punish or threaten the press or individuals based on the content of what is reported. In fact, in a public forum, which Twitter was deemed to be, a federal court already ordered Trump to unblock Twitter users who were critical of him.\n\nThere is actually a lawsuit pending alleging that Trump is violating the First Amendment of members of the press by using the powers of his office to curtail criticism. As I reported last month, \u201cPEN\u2019s lawsuit is not brought on behalf of those whom Trump threatened (e.g., The Post, Time Warner). Instead, it alleges: \u2018Defendant\u2019s use of the power and machinery of government to punish his media critics creates an atmosphere in which journalists must work under the threat of government retaliation. This environment, underscored by Defendant Trump\u2019s campaign of intimidation against critical reporting, casts a chill on speech that \u2014 even if braved and overcome by diligent and courageous reporters \u2014 constitutes an ongoing First Amendment violation.'\u201d\n\n[Molly Roberts: Sarah Sanders\u2019s diabolically clever attack on Jim Acosta]\n\nAcosta has an even more obvious case because he is the one whose rights have been directly violated. (The current lawsuit could also be amended specifically to reference the Acosta incident as precisely the sort of action that would chill the First Amendment rights of others.) The utility of filing a lawsuit (other than in annoying and embarrassing Trump and Sanders) would be a declaratory judgment ordering the White House to return Acosta\u2019s credentials and barring the White House from taking such action in the future.\n\nThis is a far better option than writing pointed statements as both CNN and the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association did on Wednesday. The statements, without further action, make the press appear feckless. They simply underscore the president\u2019s dominance over the media.\n\nWhile I believe the press must continue to cover and attend news conferences when Trump is present, there is absolutely no reason to attend Sanders\u2019s briefings, which do not impart information but instead use the press as a forum to abuse and threaten reporters and spread misinformation. Sanders is not the news; the White House is the news. Reporters can cover their beats and obtain comment as necessary from Sanders without attending, let alone covering live, her (albeit rare) news briefings.\n\nSanders whines that the press is too critical or too mean or something. She can think whatever she pleases, but she is an employee of the American people and has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution like every other White House employee. She has no right to use her office to lie to the American people, let alone to violate the First Amendment. She has disgraced herself and should be denied the normal presumption of good faith accorded to past White House press secretaries. I condemn harassment and threatening conduct of any sort (shame on the protesters who showed up at Tucker Carlson\u2019s home and made threats); however, after leaving office, she deserves none of the niceties normally accorded to others in her position. (In the past, we would have said that she has not earned the right to be included in polite society.) No responsible news outlet should hire her; employers making hiring decisions have every reason to shun her.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhite House goes authoritarian on CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta\n\nNow what happens to Mueller?\n\nYear of the woman?

Nathan Deal (R) that he had submitted his resignation as secretary of state and would begin preparing to take over as governor.\n\n\u201cWe won the race,\u201d Kemp told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear now. We are moving forward with the transition.\u201d\n\nKemp had 50.3 percent of the vote to Abrams\u2019s 48.7 percent as of midday Thursday, according to the Associated Press. But the Abrams campaign argued that balloting had been grossly mishandled, citing reports of voting hurdles and problems with vote-counting.\n\nA similar debate is emerging in Florida, where Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum appeared to back off his election-night concession to Republican Ron DeSantis, citing reports of uncounted ballots.\n\n\u201cOur campaign . . . is monitoring the situation closely and is ready for any outcome, including a state-mandated recount,\u201d the campaign said Thursday in a statement.\n\nReports of voting problems were prevalent in both Georgia and Florida, where Abrams and Gillum ran to be their states\u2019 first black governors.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said that Democrats had \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in Georgia and were monitoring the possibility of recounts in Florida.\n\nIn both states, they were coordinating with campaigns to see whether provisional ballots, or absentee ballots rejected because signatures didn\u2019t match \u2014 an election standard that Democrats consider to be voter suppression \u2014 were being counted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got folks on our voter protection team right now, chasing provisional ballots,\u201d Perez said at a breakfast roundtable sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. \u201cThey claim there are something like 22,000 or 25,000 provisional ballots still out in Georgia. I\u2019ll be honest with you; I don\u2019t believe them. I think there\u2019s more. The problem is that the fox is guarding the henhouse; the person who wants to be governor is overseeing the integrity of the election.\u201d\n\nPerez also suggested that the close statewide races in Florida could change if every vote cast was counted, a process that could well involve lawsuits.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an army of lawyers down there now that are working on the recount, and I\u2019m glad they\u2019re doing that,\u201d said Perez. \u201cVoter suppression is a permanent staple in the [Republican] playbook and that\u2019s a lesson that we have to learn as a party.\u201d\n\n[Election results in Florida and Georgia prompt soul-searching for African Americans]\n\nIn Georgia, Kemp\u2019s margin had narrowed Wednesday as election officials counted outstanding ballots.

Kemp has strongly denied claims of impropriety.\n\n\u201cThe integrity of the process has been clear in Georgia,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cThe election integrity is beyond doubt.\u201d\n\nNonprofit group Protect Democracy said Kemp\u2019s resignation came just before a federal court hearing in its lawsuit seeking to stop him from overseeing the governor\u2019s race.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge victory for democracy and the rule of law,\u201d Larry Schwartztol, counsel for Protect Democracy, said in a statement. \u201cIt is a basic constitutional principle that a person may not be a judge in their own case and that\u2019s what Brian Kemp was attempting to be here.\u201d\n\nKemp called the lawsuit, as well as others filed in the race, \u201cquite honestly, ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to fight that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe votes are not there for her.\u201d\n\nWrangling over gubernatorial balloting in Florida and Georgia came as several key races remained unresolved around the country, including Senate races in Arizona and Florida and close to a dozen House races.\n\nIn the Florida Senate race, Republican Rick Scott had 50.1 percent of the vote as of Thursday afternoon, while Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson had 49.9 percent, according to the AP.\n\nMarc Elias, a prominent election lawyer representing Nelson\u2019s campaign, predicted a recount and an eventual Nelson victory. He said the margin between the two campaigns was now less than 22,000 votes.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say right now the results of the 2018 Senate election are unknown, and [the media] and elections officials should treat it as such,\u201d Elias said on a conference call with reporters.\n\nElias said he was not sure whether Nelson would be in the lead going into a recount.\n\n\u201cI would say, you know, it\u2019s a jump ball,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may be up by 5,000 votes, we may be down by 5,000 votes.

Her victory marked the party\u2019s 29th pickup in the lower chamber, with several races still undecided, according to a tally by The Washington Post.\n\nMcBath was a first-time congressional candidate who jumped into the race at the last minute, citing February\u2019s mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 dead. She became an activist after her 17-year-old son was fatally shot in 2012 by a man who had argued with the teen and his friends about loud music coming from their car.\n\nSeveral political forecasters had moved the race in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District from \u201cleans Republicans\u201d to \u201ctoss-up\u201d over the weekend. The Associated Press reported that McBath got 50.5 percent of the vote to Handel\u2019s 49.5 percent, with 100 percent of precincts reporting.\n\nHandel\u2019s short-lived tenure in the House came after she beat Democrat Jon Ossoff in the 2017 special election to replace outgoing Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), who left to become President Trump\u2019s first secretary of health and human services.\n\nThe race drew national attention as an early referendum on Trump in a district Republicans had held since 1979.\n\nAmy Gardner, Sean Sullivan and David Weigel contributed to this report.", "\n\n(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nPresident Trump has forced out his attorney general and replaced him with a loyalist who will now oversee special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation. Speculation is rampant: Will the new acting attorney general fire Mueller? Constrain his investigation? Block Mueller\u2019s findings from going public?\n\nWe don\u2019t know whether Matthew Whitaker, Trump\u2019s replacement for Jeff Sessions, will go through with these things. But here\u2019s something we can conclude right now: Trump surely picked Whitaker, Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, expressly to put him in the position of being able to do any and all of them.\n\nUnlike Sessions, who recused himself from the probe, Whitaker will oversee it, whereas before, that had fallen to Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein. Whitaker can theoretically fire Mueller by invoking some rationale that fulfills the relevant regulations\u2019 requirement for \u201ccause,\u201d or he can revoke those regulations. Or he can severely limit the scope of the investigation, or starve it of funds.\n\nAsk yourself: What would this look like if Republicans had held the House? We would be concluding that Trump is taking steps to close down or limit the probe, or keep its findings covered up, in the full knowledge that congressional Republicans will let him get away with it. Which is why it\u2019s a good thing that Democrats did capture the House.\n\nAt his news conference on Wednesday in the wake of the Democratic victory, Trump raged over the investigation. He said that if House Democrats investigate his administration \u2014 an activity known as congressional oversight \u2014 that the White House can retaliate by investigating Democrats. Trump vowed a \u201cwarlike posture.\u201d This lays the groundwork to dramatically resist whatever Democrats do in response to Trump\u2019s moves against the Mueller probe.\n\nSo what can Democrats do in these scenarios, once they\u2019re in the majority? Here\u2019s a rundown:\n\nHouse Democrats can investigate the firing of Sessions. The question of whether Trump fired Sessions or whether Sessions merely resigned is critical. If Trump fired Sessions, it might not be legit that Trump replaced him with an acting attorney general (Whitaker) who didn\u2019t require Senate confirmation (which Trump may have wanted to do to insulate the replacement from questioning from senators about his intention toward the Mueller probe). Mueller could conceivably challenge the appointment in court if Whitaker does try to shut down or severely constrain the probe.\n\nThough the White House claims Sessions resigned at Trump\u2019s \u201crequest,\u201d it seems obvious that Trump did fire him. The Post reports that Sessions thought staying would protect \u201cthe investigation\u2019s integrity,\u201d which would leave the country \u201cbetter served,\u201d as its findings will be \u201cmore credible to the American public.\u201d So House Democrats can try to investigate the circumstances leading up to Sessions\u2019s \u201cresignation,\u201d to determine whether Sessions did resist it and was fired.\n\n\u201cThe rationale would be that they were investigating to determine whether Sessions was fired as part of a conspiracy to obstruct justice,\u201d Josh Chafetz, a professor at Cornell Law School, told me. \u201cThis could entail requests for documents and witness testimony.\u201d\n\nSubpoena Sessions himself. House Democrats can try to question Sessions himself, both about the circumstances surrounding his firing and, more broadly, about private meetings in which Trump raged at Sessions for failing to protect him from the investigation. Sessions would likely assert executive privilege regarding his conversations with Trump.\n\nBut Democrats have recourse. They can \u201chaul Sessions in and make him refuse to answer questions live, on TV,\u201d Chafetz told me. \u201cThen, after some arguing back and forth, if Democrats decide that the assertion of privilege is improper, they can hold him in contempt.\u201d Whether that would do much is anybody\u2019s guess, but at least the spectacle of Sessions refusing to say whether Trump forced him out and why would be dramatized for the country.\n\nSubpoena Mueller\u2019s findings. Under the regulations governing the special counsel, he is to provide a \u201cconfidential\u201d report explaining his conclusions to the person overseeing the probe \u2014 who would have been Rosenstein but now will be Whitaker. It is Whitaker who is then supposed to provide a report to the bipartisan leaders of the House and Senate judiciary committees, which gives him a great deal of discretion to decide how much to put in that report.\n\nWhitaker could theoretically report little to nothing, in effect covering up what Mueller learned. \u201cDemocrats could subpoena Mueller\u2019s findings,\u201d Chafetz tells me. \u201cBut expect the White House to put up a fight in response to the subpoena.\u201d Other legal experts think that if the White House defied such a subpoena, the courts would rule against them, meaning Congress would get Mueller\u2019s findings.\n\nAs Chafetz has written elsewhere, one key thing Democrats must think hard about is how to use such proceedings to inform the public about what\u2019s happening, both for political and substantive reasons.\n\nImpeach the acting attorney general. This is a far-fetched scenario, but it\u2019s not an impossibility. As it is, Whitaker has publicly opined that Mueller has gone too far in probing Trump\u2019s finances and has openly suggested that one option is to de-fund the investigation. On these grounds, Democrats have called for his recusal.\n\nHere an irony kicks in. A handful of House Republicans loyal to Trump tried to impeach Rosenstein earlier this year on grounds so specious that even many Republicans, including the leadership, rejected it. It\u2019s hard to say what circumstances might justify such a move against Whitaker, if any, but if he shuts down the Mueller probe without good cause, that might be seen as extremely serious misconduct \u2014 far more serious than what Republicans alleged against Rosenstein.\n\nJonathan Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University, points out that there are other forms of misconduct Whitaker could commit. Whether or not his public opinions merit recusal, he should still solicit a Justice Department ethics opinion on whether he should oversee the probe. \u201cRosenstein did this, and some Republicans still called for his impeachment,\u201d Adler notes. \u201cIf Whitaker fails to take the same prudent step, it would be inexcusable.\u201d\n\nIt seems obvious that once Democrats take over the House, we are headed for a major escalation in hostilities. Trump is already testing to see what he can get away with, so it\u2019s good that leading Democrats just responded with a letter calling on Republicans to hold emergency hearings on Trump\u2019s move, arguing that the appointment of Whitaker is precipitating a \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d Republicans will shrug, but this suggests Democrats recognize the gravity of the moment and are organizing to respond accordingly.\n\nRead more:\n\nGreg Sargent: Trump just reminded us that he\u2019s still a dangerous authoritarian madman\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Jeff Sessions\u2019s ouster is not surprising.

The repeated frames were shown only at the moment of contact and made Acosta\u2019s arm movement look more exaggerated, said Shane Raymond, a journalist at Storyful.\n\nThe video has quickly become a flashpoint in the battle over viral misinformation, turning a live interaction watched by thousands in real time into just another ideological tug-of-war.

(Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nWith Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s forced resignation, all eyes are now on his temporary replacement, Matthew G. Whitaker, who had been serving as Sessions\u2019s chief of staff. The Post reports:\n\nA Justice Department official said Whitaker would assume authority over the special counsel probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election \u2014 though his role could be reviewed by ethics officials. Because Sessions was recused, the special counsel probe had been overseen by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who also has had strained relations with Trump, but is considered safe in his position for the moment. Rosenstein was headed to the White House Wednesday afternoon for what an official said was a pre-scheduled meeting. Though Sessions\u2019s removal was long expected, the installation of Whitaker sparked fears that the president might be trying to exert control over the special counsel investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nThere is good reason to demand his recusal. In July 2017, Whitaker speculated on CNN that he \u201ccould see a scenario where Jeff Sessions is replaced with a recess appointment,\u201d or that the attorney general doesn\u2019t fire Mueller but reduces his budget so much that his investigation grinds to almost a halt. He also suggested Rosenstein could be leaned on to cut off funding.\n\nMore substantively, this is one step worse than Trump picking a Supreme Court justice (Brett M. Kavanaugh) to rule on cases affecting him. Here, he\u2019s in essence picking the overseer of an investigation into him and his cronies. Ethics guru Norman L. Eisen tells me, \u201cIf ever there was an appearance of impropriety, this is it. . . . We have a criminal subject president appointing his own prosecutor \u2014 one who has evidently prejudged the case.\u201d He comments, \u201cThis stinks to high heavens. No prosecutor \u2014 or indeed governmental official of any kind \u2014 should work on a matter under these circumstances. Whitaker must step aside. This is just as odious, in its own way, as Sessions\u2019s conflict was, maybe more so.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are already raising many of the same concerns. \u201cI am deeply concerned that President Trump, both in forcing Attorney General Sessions\u2019s resignation, and effectively stripping Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein of his authority to supervise the Mueller investigation, is now in position to easily interfere with or even end the Mueller investigation,\u201d said Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201cThat is a red line which President Trump has been warned not to cross by Republicans and Democrats alike for months.\u201d\n\nCoons continued, \u201cThe president and Mr. Whitaker must demonstrate that the Mueller investigation will continue under its current leadership and supervision unimpeded. Given his previous comments about the investigation, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself from oversight of the special counsel investigation during his tenure as acting attorney general.\u201d\n\nHe warned that attempts to muzzle or influence the special counsel would amount to \u201can historic attack on the rule of law, and the beginning of a crisis the likes of which we have not seen since Watergate.\u201d He urged passage of legislation to protect the special counsel.\n\nRep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who will chair the House Oversight Committee, was blunt. \u201cCongress must now investigate the real reason for this termination, confirm that Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker is recused from all aspects of the Special Counsel\u2019s probe, and ensure that the Department of Justice safeguards the integrity of the Mueller investigation,\u201d he said in a written statement.\n\nDemocrats in Congress (let\u2019s stop expecting Republicans to behave responsibly) should act decisively. Constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe counsels, \u201cThis rule-of-law crisis has been a slow-motion train wreck for a long time. Matt Whitaker is on record about the ways to clip Mueller\u2019s wings and the alleged need to do so. And I suspect that too few ordinary people will care that this Wednesday afternoon massacre has quietly taken place.\u201d\n\nThere is good reason, then, for Democrats to demand immediate hearings and to demand that any ruling on the matter by DOJ ethics counsel be released forthwith.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump freaks out after the election and ousts Sessions\n\nWhat do the midterms say about 2020?", "SAO PAULO \u2014 Police arrested state legislators in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday as part of an investigation into allegations they accepted bribes in exchange for supporting a criminal organization run by a former governor, Brazilian officials said.\n\nFormer Gov. Sergio Cabral is serving a prison sentence for his participation in a massive corruption scheme in which prosecutors say he received hundreds of thousands of dollars a month to help companies secure contracts that ranged from projects in Rio\u2019s slums to the refurbishing of its Maracana Stadium.

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nCARLSBAD, Calif. \u2014 The joke was either seven years in the making, or it rolled off the top of Scott Boras\u2019s head.\n\nEither way, the agent was ready to unleash it when asked about client Bryce Harper at baseball\u2019s general managers' meetings Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWell, certainly Harper\u2019s bazaar has begun,\u201d said Boras, likening Harper\u2019s free agency to the classic women\u2019s magazine, and he did not stop there. \u201cIt\u2019s fashionable, it\u2019s historical, it\u2019s elite, global certainly. And certainly it has inspirations that deal with great shoes and great hair, inspirations on the part of Bryce.\u201d\n\nThe delivery \u2014 dry, deadpan, direct \u2014 was very Boras. So was the setting, outside at the Omni La Costa Resort and Spa, at the top of a short flight of stairs, with dozens of reporters packed tightly around him, recorders on and iPhone cameras fixed in the air. It was all an on-the-nose reminder of how much of this week and this offseason centers on the 66-year-old. All of Major League Baseball is wondering where Harper could land after he declined the Washington Nationals' 10-year, $300 million offer, which materialized at the end of September and would have been the largest free agent deal in the history of U.S. sports.\n\n[Thomas Boswell: Bryce Harper and the Nationals take the high road. Both will benefit.]\n\nBoras offers this sort of State of the Agency address at each annual general managers' meeting, and it is part examination of the sport\u2019s issues, part promotion of his clients, part chance to see how many metaphors he can use to describe baseball and its free agent market. This year\u2019s hinted at how he is selling Harper to teams, and just how much he thinks the 26-year-old is worth.\n\nAnd he laid that out in a way only he can.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in a category of talent and player in the game that rarely is there, you\u2019re talking about a process I think that is very unconventional because you\u2019re dealing with a generational player,\u201d Boras said. \u201cAnd what is a generational player? That is that he holds the qualities of elite performance, he holds the youngest age in free agent history to be available for the greatest number of elite years of performance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that anyone who\u2019s done what Bryce Harper has done at 25, if you\u2019ve done that you are almost a lock to be a Hall of Fame player,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd we have exhibited this in our documents to the owners we have met with, and we clarified this 14 different ways.\u201d\n\nHe did not go through those 14 ways Wednesday, at least not with reporters, but his pitch was broken into clear segments: Harper is young, and he would only be 36 at the end of the decade-long deal Boras seems to be seeking. He is marketable, hair flip and all, and had a large hand in helping the Nationals raise television ratings and attendance numbers since he debuted as a 19-year-old phenom in 2012. And he has been close to peerless at the plate throughout that time, compiling a 1.109 on-base-plus-slugging percentage during his MVP year of 2015, which put him in the conversation with Hall of Famers such as Mickey Mantle, Stan Musial, Willie McCovey, Hank Greenberg and George Brett.\n\nThis is what Boras will tell any interested teams in the coming couple of months, and the Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Dodgers, St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs are a few franchises that have been linked to Harper, along with the Nationals. Washington\u2019s offer included no opt-outs and is believed to be \u201coff the table,\" since the team set an expiration date to give itself time to approach the market with a Harper-less future in mind. But the Nationals could circle back to Harper, according to multiple people familiar with the situation, and sweeten their initial deal.\n\n\u201cTo suggest that Ted Lerner is not savvy about acquisition of rights, I think he\u2019s the wealthiest owner in the game, so I\u2019d say that he\u2019s adept and wise,\u201d Boras said when asked about the Nationals principal owner\u2019s approach to Harper\u2019s free agency. \u201cAnd obviously if you\u2019ve got the ability to negotiate and present something when no one else can, I think any owner would want to take opportunity to advance it and let the player know how they feel before he exercised his right and went on to the process.\u201d\n\n[Nationals have made efforts to extend Anthony Rendon, regardless of Bryce Harper\u2019s decision]\n\nThat all led Boras\u2019s anticipated appearance to become even more of a spectacle Wednesday. It was not on the event\u2019s official schedule \u2014 the league would never do that \u2014 but \u201cBoras talking at 2\u201d started to course through the lobby and hallways by late morning. At 1:40 p.m., reporters trickled into a courtyard flanked by boutique stores on one side and the resort\u2019s front entrance on the other. They scattered into pockets of the open space, stuffing hands in pockets, burying faces in phones, looking unsure of where to stand, as if everyone were thrust back in time to an awkward middle school dance.\n\nClose to an hour later, once Boras emerged with his large entourage, the crowd was herded down a small hill to where the agent stood at the top of those steps. He held a three-page packet in his hands, with notes on baseball\u2019s waning attendance numbers, Harper and some of the other notable free agents he represents. Hall of Fame outfielder Reggie Jackson walked up and joked that once Boras arrived, everyone stopped talking to him and migrated in the agent\u2019s direction. Boras laughed, introduced Jackson and then dived into a 64-minute session that started with a breakdown of baseball\u2019s popularity problems.\n\nHe described the culture of tanking, intentionally stripping down a roster to expedite a massive rebuild, as \u201ccancer.\u201d He noted that Louisiana State University\u2019s baseball team had a better average attendance than the Miami Marlins. He suggested that \u201cfans in Florida have brought the M-I-A to Miami,\u201d that turnout is so bad in Minnesota that \u201csometimes only one of the Twins shows up,\u201d and Toronto Blue Jays fans must be dealing with the \u201cblue flu\u201d because they sure aren\u2019t heading to Rogers Centre to see games.\n\nSoon he circled around to Harper, the player he believes could elevate excitement in any city, who can lift a television market on his own, who pours people into seats with the power that rests in his bat. Harper is on the market with 26-year-old shortstop Manny Machado, a star who should demand a similar-size contract, and they will be the talk of baseball until their futures are worked out. Boras did not indicate where Harper may end up at the end of this. It would be really difficult to know that quite yet. But he did imply, rather earnestly, that any destination for Harper will be decided on with a steep, steep price.\n\nThe bazaar has certainly begun. Next we will see who intends to shop.\n\n\u201cI think Bryce is open to opportunities. He\u2019s listened to a lot of things,\u201d Boras said. \u201cI think owners do a great job of forecasting the benefits of their franchise, and many have done a really good job of talking about what they need to improve on. So as we go through this, I think he is going to hear everything from everyone and certainly make an informed decision.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nNationals\u2019 offer to Bryce Harper was biggest free agent deal in U.S. sports history.

The election returns provide ample reason for those working to shift the gender balance in politics to celebrate. Consider:\n\nOf their seven gubernatorial pickups, four of the Democratic winners were women.\n\nThe only Democratic Senate candidate to pick up a seat was a woman, Sen.-elect Jacky Rosen of Nevada.\n\nWomen will hold at least 96 seats in the House, a record; at least 23 members of the U.S. Senate and nine governors will be women.\n\nOverall, at least 117 women have been elected as House members, senators or governors.\n\nIt\u2019s not simply that women won, but women brand new to politics and/or running to be the \u201cfirst\u201d won (e.g., African American House member from Massachusetts, two Native American women, female governor in Maine). A number of the big wins were notched by women who had served in the military or the intelligence community \u2014 one powerful reason for fully integrating women into these avenues of public service. These include former CIA operative Abigail Spanberger of Virginia; Elissa Slotkin, an Iraq War veteran from Michigan; former Navy commander Elaine Luria of Virginia; and former Navy helicopter pilot Mikie Sherrill from New Jersey. While the vast majority of successful women candidates were Democrats, Republican women broke through to win the governorship in South Dakota and a Senate seat in Tennessee.\n\nCertainly, President Trump provoked a lot of women to run for office for the first time, to march and to canvas, to give to political causes and \u2014 most important to the county\u2019s political realignment \u2014 to vote for Democrats. Whether it was his bullying or his racism or his support for alleged child molester Roy Moore or his own payoffs to accusers or his nonstop stream of insults about and to women, a whole lot of women decided, rather than to stew, to get into the fray. Wins in the suburbs can in large part be attributed to women shifting support from Republican to Democrat for the House.\n\nAbsorbing the constant sting of Trump\u2019s verbal arrows, women did not \u201cget over\u201d Trump\u2019s election or learn to live with his serial affronts. They did not take kindly to his mocking of the #MeToo movement or of Christine Blasey Ford. It\u2019s fair to say that women who would not have otherwise gotten politically involved did so because they could clearly see the mostly male political powers were not looking after their interests. So they marched, they organized, they became donors, they ran for office, they made new alliances, they \u201cpersisted,\u201d as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) complained when Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) refused to sit down and be quiet as instructed on the Senate floor.\n\nAnd here, one should take a step back to appreciate that for all Trump\u2019s assaults on the rule of law, the attacks on democratic norms, the attempt to intimidate the media and the undermining of objective reality, Trump\u2019s anti-democratic actions were met with an outpouring of democratic activism, by some of the people (women) who felt most aggrieved by his conduct. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 plenty of men organized, ran for office, became donors and the like, but women who had broken barriers in the military and persevered as immigrants or who had never dreamed of a political career or (weekends of marches) jumped into the fray for the first time. That says a lot of about the vitality of our democracy and the ability of women to creatively organize outside conventional political networks.\n\nOnce elected, these women may behave somewhat differently from their male counterparts and even from women who came up in politics in past generations. Many of the newly elected officials come with a decided outsider\u2019s perspective and with a strong tradition of public service. Perhaps they will be more inclined to push for ethics reform and public transparency. In addition, they haven\u2019t spent their adult lives in partisan trenches so possibly they will exhibit the desire and skill to reach across the aisle. If so, the country will be in their debt.

It said all IS fighters in the area where the hostages were held have been killed.\n\nThe Suwayda 24 activist collective quoted local officials as saying the women and children held by IS have all been freed.\n\n\u201cMy happiness is huge,\u201d Nashaat Abu Ammar, whose wife, two sons and daughter are among those freed, told The Associated Press by telephone.\n\nThe 19 women and children were among 30 people kidnapped by IS in the southern province of Sweida on July 25 when militants of the extremist group ambushed residents and went on a killing spree that left at least 216 people dead.\n\nThe rare attacks in Sweida province, populated mainly by Syria\u2019s minority Druze, came amid a government offensive elsewhere in the country\u2019s south. The coordinated attacks across the province, which included several suicide bombings, shattered the calm of a region that had been largely spared from the worst of the violence of Syria\u2019s seven-year long civil war.\n\n\n\nIn this photo released by the Syrian official news agency SANA, shows women and children who has been liberated from the Islamic State group in the Hamima area east of the historic town of Palmyra, Syria, Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018.

(SANA via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nA Syrian opposition war monitor contradicted the reports on state media, saying IS set free the hostages in return for the government\u2019s release of women related to IS fighters and commanders who were held by Syrian authorities as well as a monetary payment.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was not immediately clear how much money the government paid for the release of the hostages.\n\nState TV aired footage of the women, children and teenagers in a desert area standing with soldiers who gave them bread and water. The soldier then asked the women and children for their names and wrote them on a piece of paper. The TV later aired footage showing the former hostages having meals around a table.\n\n\u201cWe are living the joy of victory in Syria,\u201d Druze cleric Sheikh Kameel Nasr told Syrian state TV.\n\nSince July, one woman died in IS custody while another was shot dead by the extremists. In August, a 19-year-old man was also killed in detention.\n\nSix other hostages, two women and four children, were freed in an exchange with the government last month. Negotiations were expected to free the remaining hostages but after the talks failed, Syrian troops launched a broad offensive against IS in southern Syria.\n\nThe July 25 attack on the southern city of Sweida and nearby villages was one of the deadliest by the extremists since they lost most of the land they once held in Syria and Iraq.\n\n\u201cI am so happy they have been freed and I thank the Syrian army for that,\u201d Abu Ammar said. The man said he is getting ready to leave his village to the provincial capital of Sweida where the freed were expected to be brought later.\n\nBy sunset, scores of people gathered in the city of Sweida waiting for the return of the former hostages.\n\nElsewhere in Syria, opposition activists and paramedics reported that two blasts in rebel-held parts of northern Syria have inflicted casualties.\n\nThe Observatory said the first explosion occurred in the northern town of Azaz wounding six children while the opposition\u2019s Syrian Civil Defense said four were wounded including three children.\n\nThe observatory and other opposition activists reported another blast in the town of Jinderis saying a bomb went off outside an office of the Turkey-backed Failaq al-Sham rebel group killing three fighters and wounding seven.\n\nAzaz and Jeideris are controlled by Turkey-backed opposition fighters.

(Illumination and Universal Pictures)\n\nRating:\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cBah! Humbug!\u201d Can a Christmas movie that\u2019s being released in November, well before Thanksgiving, be any good? It just so happens that the new animated version of the Dr. Seuss classic \u201cHow the Grinch Stole Christmas\u201d is a welcome, if early, Christmas gift. You\u2019d have to be a Scrooge to resist it.\n\nThe Grinch (voice of Benedict Cumberbatch) lives in a spacious mountaintop lair, high above the town of Whoville, with his faithful mutt, Max. When we meet him, five days before Christmas, he\u2019s bitter and alone, a grumpy fur ball who just doesn\u2019t feel the holiday spirit. What\u2019s worse, he doesn\u2019t want anybody else to feel it. Yet no matter what mischief he throws at the Whovillians \u2014 everything from refusing to accept their cheery wishes to knocking over their groceries \u2014 they take it in stride.\n\nWhen the Grinch learns that the Mayor of Whoville (Angela Lansbury) has decreed that this year\u2019s Christmas celebration be three times bigger than ever before, he lays plans for a major disruption.\n\nHe\u2019s not the only one anxious about the holiday. Little Cindy Lou Who (Cameron Seely) has an urgent wish for Santa. But this wide-eyed tyke doesn\u2019t want toys. Rather, her wish is for relief for her overworked mother (Rashida Jones).\n\nCan Cindy Lou\u2019s selflessness teach the Grinch something about the Christmas spirit?\n\n\n\nCindy Lou Who (voice of Cameron Seely) gets ready to mail a letter to Santa Claus in \u201cThe Grinch.\u201d (Illumination and Universal Pictures)\n\nWorking from a script by Michael LeSieur and Tommy Swerdlow, directors Yarrow Cheney and Scott Mosier stay close to the tone of the 1966 TV special based on Dr. Seuss\u2019s book, even as they take liberties with backstory and character development. The Grinch\u2019s aversion to holiday crowds, for instance, serves an unusual purpose here: helping you identify with the villain. That may be unexpected for a children\u2019s movie, but what adult \u2014 or at least the introverted ones \u2014 hasn\u2019t felt apprehension about the sometimes overly hectic holiday season?\n\nSuch empathy for the Grinch is, ironically, very much in the Christmas spirit. Like Cindy Lou, can\u2019t we feel a little generosity of heart, even to those who wish us harm?\n\nIn an odd way, \u201cThe Grinch\u201d feels like a kid\u2019s version of last year\u2019s \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\u201d a heavy drama that invited us to see an unpleasant supporting character (Oscar winner Sam Rockwell) not as a monster, but as a human being, worthy of redemption.\n\nWith its charming character animation and inventive art direction, \u201cThe Grinch\u201d is a vast improvement over Ron Howard\u2019s live-action adaptation of the same story. That garish 2000 film, which starred Jim Carrey as the Grinch, looked like a cat that ate German Expressionism, the paintings of Thomas Kinkade and the Target holiday aisle, and then threw up a 100-minute hairball.\n\nCompared with that travesty, this new \u201cGrinch\u201d is \u201cCitizen Kane.\u201d (In fact, the movie referen\u00adces Orson Welles\u2019s 1941 masterpiece when we see the Grinch sharing a meal with Max, each of them at opposite ends of a long banquet table.) This endearing update of a holiday classic reminds us that the Christmas season can be hard for the lonely. It offers up an optimistic message that the Grinches of the world might melt their hard hearts if we meet them face to face \u2014 not with rancor, but with love.", "With his race still unresolved, Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp resigned his position as the state\u2019s top election official and declared victory, drawing a strong rebuke from Democrat Stacey Abrams, whose campaign estimated that there were thousands of ballots outstanding or unaccounted for.\n\nKemp announced at a news conference with Gov. Nathan Deal (R) that he had submitted his resignation as secretary of state and would begin preparing to take over as governor.\n\n\u201cWe won the race,\u201d Kemp told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear now. We are moving forward with the transition.\u201d\n\nKemp had 50.3 percent of the vote to Abrams\u2019s 48.7 percent as of midday Thursday, according to the Associated Press. But the Abrams campaign argued that balloting had been grossly mishandled, citing reports of voting hurdles and problems with vote-counting.\n\nA similar debate is emerging in Florida, where Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum appeared to back off his election-night concession to Republican Ron DeSantis, citing reports of uncounted ballots.\n\n\u201cOur campaign . . . is monitoring the situation closely and is ready for any outcome, including a state-mandated recount,\u201d the campaign said Thursday in a statement.\n\nReports of voting problems were prevalent in both Georgia and Florida, where Abrams and Gillum ran to be their states\u2019 first black governors.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said that Democrats had \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in Georgia and were monitoring the possibility of recounts in Florida.\n\nIn both states, they were coordinating with campaigns to see whether provisional ballots, or absentee ballots rejected because signatures didn\u2019t match \u2014 an election standard that Democrats consider to be voter suppression \u2014 were being counted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got folks on our voter protection team right now, chasing provisional ballots,\u201d Perez said at a breakfast roundtable sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. \u201cThey claim there are something like 22,000 or 25,000 provisional ballots still out in Georgia. I\u2019ll be honest with you; I don\u2019t believe them. I think there\u2019s more. The problem is that the fox is guarding the henhouse; the person who wants to be governor is overseeing the integrity of the election.\u201d\n\nPerez also suggested that the close statewide races in Florida could change if every vote cast was counted, a process that could well involve lawsuits.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an army of lawyers down there now that are working on the recount, and I\u2019m glad they\u2019re doing that,\u201d said Perez. \u201cVoter suppression is a permanent staple in the [Republican] playbook and that\u2019s a lesson that we have to learn as a party.\u201d\n\n[Election results in Florida and Georgia prompt soul-searching for African Americans]\n\nIn Georgia, Kemp\u2019s margin had narrowed Wednesday as election officials counted outstanding ballots. If his share of the vote falls below 50 percent, he and Abrams would face each other in a runoff election.\n\nAt a news conference, lawyers for the Abrams campaign announced that they were filing a preliminary lawsuit in Dougherty County over problems with mail-in ballots and weighing other possible litigation.\n\n\u201cWe are not stopping until we are confident that every vote has been counted,\u201d said Abrams campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo.\n\nGeorgia voters described hours-long lines Tuesday and polling places that struggled with a shortage of voting machines, broken equipment and a dearth of printed provisional ballots.\n\nNoting that many of the reports came from communities with large minority populations, voting rights advocates charged Kemp with using his power as the state\u2019s chief election official to interfere with the race. Kemp has strongly denied claims of impropriety.\n\n\u201cThe integrity of the process has been clear in Georgia,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cThe election integrity is beyond doubt.\u201d\n\nNonprofit group Protect Democracy said Kemp\u2019s resignation came just before a federal court hearing in its lawsuit seeking to stop him from overseeing the governor\u2019s race.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge victory for democracy and the rule of law,\u201d Larry Schwartztol, counsel for Protect Democracy, said in a statement. \u201cIt is a basic constitutional principle that a person may not be a judge in their own case and that\u2019s what Brian Kemp was attempting to be here.\u201d\n\nKemp called the lawsuit, as well as others filed in the race, \u201cquite honestly, ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to fight that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe votes are not there for her.\u201d\n\nWrangling over gubernatorial balloting in Florida and Georgia came as several key races remained unresolved around the country, including Senate races in Arizona and Florida and close to a dozen House races.\n\nIn the Florida Senate race, Republican Rick Scott had 50.1 percent of the vote as of Thursday afternoon, while Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson had 49.9 percent, according to the AP.\n\nMarc Elias, a prominent election lawyer representing Nelson\u2019s campaign, predicted a recount and an eventual Nelson victory. He said the margin between the two campaigns was now less than 22,000 votes.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say right now the results of the 2018 Senate election are unknown, and [the media] and elections officials should treat it as such,\u201d Elias said on a conference call with reporters.\n\nElias said he was not sure whether Nelson would be in the lead going into a recount.\n\n\u201cI would say, you know, it\u2019s a jump ball,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may be up by 5,000 votes, we may be down by 5,000 votes. I think either way, we\u2019re going to be in a recount.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s campaign \u2014 as well as Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio \u2014 painted Elias as a hired gun from Washington, D.C., whose intention was to \u201csteal\u201d the election.\n\n\u201cIt is sad and embarrassing that Bill Nelson would resort to these low tactics after the voters have clearly spoken. Maybe next, he\u2019ll start ranting that Russians stole the election from him,\u201d Scott\u2019s campaign said in a statement.\n\nElias is known for his ties to leading Democrats and served as general counsel for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nA handful of House races were called Thursday.\n\nIn Georgia, Democrats triumphed in a tight Atlanta area congressional race after Republican Rep.

Her victory marked the party\u2019s 29th pickup in the lower chamber, with several races still undecided, according to a tally by The Washington Post.\n\nMcBath was a first-time congressional candidate who jumped into the race at the last minute, citing February\u2019s mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 dead. She became an activist after her 17-year-old son was fatally shot in 2012 by a man who had argued with the teen and his friends about loud music coming from their car.\n\nSeveral political forecasters had moved the race in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District from \u201cleans Republicans\u201d to \u201ctoss-up\u201d over the weekend.

Bangladesh\u2019s Election Commission announced Thursday that the next national election will be held Dec. 23, despite the imprisonment of the main opposition leader. (A.M. Ahad, File/Associated Press)\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Bangladesh\u2019s Election Commission announced Thursday that the next national election will be held Dec. 23, despite the imprisonment of the leader of the main opposition party and the banning of its chief partner.\n\nChief Election Commissioner K.M. Nurul Huda said in a televised address that all arrangements have been made to ensure the election will be peaceful. Candidates must file their applications on Nov. 19.\n\nHuda said all political parties would receive an equal opportunity and urged all to contest the election.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina will head an election-time government as provided for in the constitution. The opposition has demanded an independent caretaker administration, saying the election could be rigged under Hasina.\n\nHasina\u2019s arch rival, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, is in jail on corruption charges. It is uncertain whether her Bangladesh Nationalist Party will participate in the polls. The party and its partners boycotted the last election in 2014, when Hasina returned to power with a commanding majority.\n\nZia, 73, has been in jail since February, when she was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment for alleged corruption in the establishment of an orphanage fund during her first term as prime minister in 1991-1996. Following an appeal, the High Court extended her sentence to 10 years.\n\nIn a second case, a trial court last month sentenced Zia to seven years in jail on corruption charges linked to a charity fund named after her late husband.\n\nZia\u2019s party says both cases are politically motivated.\n\nAlso last month, the Election Commission canceled the political registration of Jamaat-e-Islami, the main partner of Zia\u2019s party, which prevents it from contesting the election. The court said the party\u2019s registration violated election laws and the spirit of the constitution because the party had opposed the country\u2019s war of independence with Pakistan in 1971. The party is a fierce opponent of Hasina and is eager to regain its strength after the executions of its top leaders on charges of war crimes during the conflict.\n\nThe polls would be Bangladesh\u2019s 11th general election since it gained independence in the war.\n\nA newly formed opposition alliance quickly rejected the election schedule on Thursday and urged the Election Commission to push the date back. Zia\u2019s party is the main partner in the alliance.\n\nOn Thursday, Zia was returned to a Dhaka jail from a hospital where she had been receiving treatment for multiple health problems.\n\nZia faces more than 30 other cases pending in courts across the country.\n\nHer elder son, Tarique Rahman, the heir-apparent in a political culture of dynastic politics, has been in exile in London for years to avoid arrest. A court last month sentenced him in absentia to life in prison in a 2004 grenade attack case.\n\nBangladesh has been a parliamentary democracy since 1991 after an autocratic government led by former military chief H.M. Ershad was toppled by mass protests. Hasina and Zia have since ruled the country under a complex political culture in which violence has often marred the electoral process.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that election official\u2019s name is K.M.

But officials denied Pakistani media reports that she was then secretly flown out of the country.\n\nPakistani news media reported widely Thursday that Bibi, whose lawyer fled the country this week, was covertly freed from prison in the city of Multan under a high court order, driven to a military air base near the capital and flown to the Netherlands on Wednesday, accompanied by her family and the Dutch ambassador to Pakistan.\n\nPakistani officials insisted throughout the day Thursday that she had not been freed. The government, in a frantic and successful effort to stop the spreading violence last week, agreed in negotiations with protest leaders that it would not allow her to leave the country.\n\nA Foreign Ministry spokesman said later Thursday that Bibi has been released from prison but remains \u201cin a safe place in Pakistan.\u201d He cautioned the news media to verify all speculative reports of her leaving \u201cto prevent needless sensationalism and controversy.\u201d\n\n[Pakistan\u2019s top court acquits Christian woman facing death penalty for blasphemy]\n\nThe Muslim religious group leading the protests, which brought the country to a near-standstill for three days after the Oct. 31 verdict, has demanded her death and threatened to take to the streets again if the state abetted her escape. In a statement released Thursday afternoon, the group said Bibi\u2019s release and reported flight violated the agreement, brought \u201cpain and sorrow\u201d to the nation and has \u201cwritten a black chapter in history.\u201d\n\nBut in a video message, a senior leader of the group, Pir Afzal Qadri, said: \u201cWe have been assured by the government that she is in the custody of law enforcement agencies . . . and has not been flown out of the country.\u201d He said officials told the group that Bibi would not be allowed to leave until the Supreme Court rules on the appeal of her acquittal.\n\nThere were no immediate signs of further unrest, but tension and uncertainty were evident in terse official statements, along with public confusion about Bibi\u2019s status and whereabouts. Since the protests broke out, anxiety has run especially high in Christian communities, where people were elated by her acquittal last week but horrified by the violence that greeted the ruling.\n\n\u201cWe were all praying for this lady. When we heard she was free, we thought God had answered our prayers,\u201d said Aslam Massih Hassan, an elder of the Jesus Calls Christian Ministry, a brightly painted cinder-block church in a maze of alleys that is home to several thousand poor Christian families in the capital.\n\nBut within hours of the Oct. 31 court order that overturned Bibi\u2019s conviction, word spread in the community that thousands of Muslim protesters, angry at the verdict, were blocking major roads across the country.

But the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan, who issued a strong warning to the protesters but then backed off, has been criticized for capitulating to an extremist religious movement with growing political ambitions.\n\nAnalysts predict that the group\u2019s leaders, who come from Pakistan\u2019s largest Sunni Muslim school and are gaining fervent new support, will feel emboldened to act more aggressively. And activists in the Christian population, estimated at about 3 million in the Muslim-majority country of 208 million, worry that the outbursts could easily flare again and that Christians and other minority groups could be targeted for attack.\n\n\u201cIt seems like we have jungle law now. It is deeply disturbing that this one radical group has gotten so much power that they can take the whole country hostage, and no one can stop them,\u201d said Nelson Azeem, a former legislator from Punjab and a Christian leader. \u201cThis has caused great fear in the hearts of Christians and other minorities, who feel they could be targeted anywhere on charges of blasphemy and no one could protect them, no matter how baseless the charges are.\u201d\n\nPakistan\u2019s strict blasphemy laws are often used maliciously, with false accusations made against Christians and Ahmadis, a tiny minority that reveres a modern-day prophet from India. In recent years, numerous minority neighborhoods and places of worship have been attacked by frenzied mobs, enraged by rumors that someone had torn or defaced a Koran. Ahmadis are reviled by many Pakistani Muslims, who believe fervently that Muhammad was the \u201cfinal\u201d prophet.\n\n[In Pakistan, once-fringe Islamist radicals are making their way into mainstream politics]\n\nBibi, a peasant field worker and mother of four, was accused of blasphemy in 2009 after an argument with Muslim co-workers over sharing water. She was swiftly convicted and sent to prison. Even after the Supreme Court ruled, in meticulous detail, that the case against her was based on flimsy and contradictory evidence, the emotional protesters demanded that the illiterate mother of four be killed.\n\n\u201cWe are all very much scared,\u201d said Mahnaz Massih, 38, a beautician in a Christian neighborhood. \u201cThe pastor told us to hurry home after services and not linger outside. If we hear people talking about religion, we say nothing. We respect Islam, and Muslims should respect us, but some Muslims are scared, too,\u201d she added. \u201cThey don\u2019t like what is happening, but they don\u2019t dare go against it.\u201d\n\nOne reason for the wider unease is that the leader of the protesters, a cleric named Khadim Hussain Rizvi, also urged them to violently attack government officials, including the Supreme Court justices, and called on soldiers to rise up against the national army chief in the name of defending Islam.\n\nThe threat had a chilling precedent that stemmed from the Bibi case. After Salman Taseer, then the provincial governor of Punjab, publicly criticized the harsh treatment of Bibi, he was shot dead by his bodyguard, 26-year-old Mumtaz Qadri, whose personal \u201cmartyrdom\u201d for Islam became the rallying cry of Rizvi\u2019s movement.\n\n[In expansive Pakistan, Christians struggle to find space for cemeteries]\n\n\u201cWith the killing of Salman Taseer, the issue of blasphemy became a weapon in their hands,\u201d said Zahid Hussain, a writer and columnist on public affairs. \u201cWhen you work on the people\u2019s religious sensitivities and justify killing in the name of faith, you create an atmosphere of fear, and it works.\u201d\n\nThere is another, more complex reason for the government\u2019s reluctance to put the brakes on the anti-blasphemy crusade. Its storm troops may be mostly working-class Muslims, but it enjoys considerable, if mostly tacit, sympathy in high places.\n\nA senior Punjab minister visited the shrine to Qadri, who was hanged for murder in 2016, and other officials attended his funeral. Security troops distributed money to Rizvi\u2019s forces during protests last year over alleged official failures to protect the \u201cfinality of the prophethood\u201d in federal law. And Khan\u2019s party, then competing with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League in elections, made tactical alliances with Rizvi\u2019s.\n\nArmy leaders have been especially concerned by the protest leaders\u2019 calls for a military uprising against the army chief, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa. The group has insinuated that Bajwa is connected to the ostracized Ahmadi minority.

Some people saw that as emboldening white nationalists. Now people are also saying ...\u201d\n\nBut the president quickly interrupted her before dismissing her question. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019d say that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s such a racist question.\"\n\nAlcindor continued: \u201cThere are some people that say that now the Republican Party is seen as supporting white nationalism because of your rhetoric.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t believe it. I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI mean, why do I have my highest poll numbers \u2014 that\u2019s such a racist question. Honestly, I mean, I know you have it written down and you\u2019re going to tell me \u2014 let me tell you. It\u2019s a racist question.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo say that, what you said, is so insulting to me, it\u2019s a very terrible thing that you said,\u201d the president added.\n\n[Kellyanne Conway defends Trump after he calls black reporter\u2019s question \u2018racist\u2019]\n\nThis line of questioning isn\u2019t going anywhere, in part, because of the feelings of many Americans who find Trumpism to be a racist political ideology.\n\nAt any rate, it\u2019s hard to make the case that it\u2019s racist to question Trump, a self-described nationalist, about his controversial views, given the global history of nationalism and perhaps especially when many white nationalists embrace him. The president\u2019s bristling at the question only ends up creating more anxiety about his political ideology, especially among those around the world who truly think that the president believes in the inferiority of people who are not white Americans.\n\nDuring the exchange, Trump did answer Alcindor\u2019s question, saying that his nationalism was rooted in his primary love for America \u2014 not a hate for the rest of the world.\n\n\u201cYou have nationalists, you have globalists. I also love the world. And I don\u2019t mind helping the world. But we have to straighten out our country first. We have a lot of problems,\u201d he said.\n\nBut it was fair to ask Trump to lay out his embrace of nationalism given how some of his supporters have interpreted it.\n\nDuring the campaign and as recently as the 2018 election, white nationalists have embraced the politics of Trump and the candidates he supported, at least in part because they believed those ideas synced up well with their own. During the week preceding the midterm elections, politician and former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke posted multiple racist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic tweets while expressing his support for Republican candidates and Trump, who denounced Duke during the campaign.\n\nAnd on the day that Trump called it racist to be asked about his nationalism, Patrick Casey, the leader of Identity Evropa, a white nationalist organization, posted photos of himself visiting the White House to \u201cpay my respects.\u201d Casey was one of the individuals who marched in Charlottesville in 2017. It was during that time that nearly 60 percent of Americans said that Trump had encouraged white supremacists groups, according to a Quinnipiac poll.\n\nAs former Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum said on CNN earlier this month:, \u201cI have not called the president a racist, but there are racists in his sympathizers who believe he may be, which is why they go to his aid, which is why he has provided them cover. I believe his cover has led to much of the degradation in our political discourse.\"\n\nAs long as Trump backs candidates who make statements deemed as racist and his party elevates politicians with ties to white nationalism, millions of Americans will wonder about his own ideology.

For most, it will just reinforce the belief of half of Americans who think the president is a racist.", "", "", "\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) says she\u2019s confident she will win enough support to be elected speaker of the House next year, and that she is the best person for the job. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nHere\u2019s some straight talk on the Republicans\u2019 not-at-all victory. \u201cEvery half-intelligent analyst in the country looked at that map four years ago and said Republicans would likely pick up seats in South Dakota, Missouri, Indiana, and probably Montana, and would be favored in West Virginia . . . . If those analysts knew unemployment would be at a record-low level, with inflation still low by ordinary standards and no major international crisis, they would say Republicans would have an even-money chance to gain at least two additional seats from among Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Minnesota (two elections), Wisconsin, New Mexico, Virginia, Maine, and Ohio, while having a good chance of holding their seat in swing-state Nevada. In sum, the actual \u2018break-even\u2019 pickup number for Republicans on this map, in this economy, would be at least five seats, with six or seven more likely than three or four.\u201d\n\nA victory for checks and balances. \u201cA serial liar heads the executive branch. The appearance of impropriety that surrounds him is unsurpassed in the post-Watergate era. And the Constitution charges Congress with checking his abuses. Republicans have disgraced themselves over the past two years by failing to probe matters as basic as what business relationships and other conflicts divide Trump\u2019s loyalties between the country\u2019s interests and his family\u2019s interests as he presides over U.S. foreign policy. Now there is an opportunity to uncover the truth.\u201d\n\nYou can win a political victory by defending the Constitution. \u201cVoters in traditionally Republican districts in the suburbs joined those in more heavily Democratic communities to elevate Democrats to power as a check on Mr. Trump after he spent the past two years largely unconstrained by a compliant House and Senate led by Republicans.\u201d\n\nNo victory for the anti-immigration crowd. \u201c[A] review of this year and prior years\u2019 results in Virginia, Pennsylvania and Kansas, especially, make clear that running immigration restrictionists in anything but the safest, most pro-incumbent seats, is a dumb political bet. Argue about the policy all you want, but from a political standpoint, the message is pretty clear.\u201d\n\nWhen that many people vote, it\u2019s a victory for democracy. \u201cApproximately 114 million votes were cast in U.S. House races in 2018, compared to 83 million in 2014. . . . In Florida, more than 8 million voters cast ballots in the Senate matchup between Republican Rick Scott and Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson, with 99% of the vote counted. Compare that to 6 million votes in the 2014 midterm and 5.5 million in 2010 \u2014 another wave election.\u201d\n\nWhen even a Fox personality gets it, consider it a victory for the rule of law. \u201cThe president can fire an Attorney General for almost any reason, but not for an improper purpose. He cannot fire him if the purpose of the firing is to shake up the leadership of the Justice Department in order to interfere with a criminal investigation that the President wants to interfere with. Now, the person who is now running the Justice Department told CNN . . . the best way to take care of Mueller is to dry up his funds. If that is the reason for which [Matthew G.] Whitaker is now the Acting Attorney General of the United States, Mr. Whitaker himself could be in the crosshairs of Bob Mueller.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a personal victory for her. \u201cHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi celebrated a remarkable political comeback on Tuesday as the former speaker led her caucus back into the majority of the U.S. House of Representatives after eight years in the minority. . . . Her focus on the bigger prize is one reason many of those who have served with the 15-term incumbent are reluctant to bet against her. If chosen by her caucus to lead the next Congress, Mrs. Pelosi would become the first House Speaker to regain the gavel after losing it since Sam Rayburn of Texas did so in 1953.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: Trump freaks out after the election and ousts Sessions\n\nJennifer Rubin: Here\u2019s what did and didn\u2019t work for Democrats", "\n\n\"Who's Sorry Now\" by Molly Soda is a self portrait created for Instagram video in 2017.

(Aly Song/Reuters)\n\nTesla named Robyn Denholm, the chief financial officer of an Australian telecommunications firm, as chair of the electric automaker\u2019s board, the panel that oversees Elon Musk.\n\nDenholm, who joined Tesla\u2019s board in 2014, will become chair immediately and step down from her role as CFO and strategy head at Telstra in six months to hold the role full time. She \u201cwill also temporarily step down as Chair of Tesla\u2019s Audit Committee until she leaves Telstra,\u201d the automaker said.\n\nThe decision, announced late Wednesday, comes after Musk had settled a securities fraud charge in September with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over his tweets about taking Tesla private. The settlement stripped Musk of the ability to serve as chairman for three years and required Tesla to appoint two new independent directors, establish a new committee of independent directors, add controls for overseeing Musk\u2019s communications and pay penalties.\n\nIn a tweet responding to Tesla\u2019s announcement, Musk said he \u201cwould like to thank Robyn for joining the team. Great respect. Very much look forward to working together.\u201d\n\nDenholm\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes seven years in financial management at Toyota in Australia, as well as two decades as a strategy, financial and operations executive at Sun Microsystems and Juniper Networks.\n\n[The skills Tesla's new chairman will need to oversee Elon Musk]\n\nHer appointment could come as a surprise to Tesla watchers or investors who had expected the company to name one of the two new independent directors as chair, bringing on someone who had experience running operations at a manufacturing company and who had not been on the board during recent years, when Musk\u2019s erratic communications on Twitter and Tesla\u2019s production issues caused headaches for investors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been critical of the board in the past, and their ability to rein in Elon,\u201d said Gene Munster, a managing partner who leads research at the venture capital firm Loup Ventures and who described the announcement as a \u201cmissed opportunity\". Since Denholm has been on Tesla\u2019s board for four years, he said, \u201cwe question whether, in her new role, will she have a newfound influence on Elon\u2019s behavior?\u201d But he emphasized his firm remains a big believer in Tesla.\n\nTesla spokeswoman Caroline Nolan said in an email that Denholm has \u201csubstantial experience working in founder-led companies\u201d and that the board \u201cactively continues its search for a two additional independent directors.\u201d\n\nTesla\u2019s board has been criticized as being too cozy with Musk. In its proxy, Tesla states that only two of its directors \u2014 Musk and his brother, Kimbal \u2014 don\u2019t meet the independence standards as defined by Nasdaq and that the board \u201cundertook an analysis for each non-employee director and considered all other relevant facts and circumstances.\u201d But the influential proxy adviser, Institutional Shareholder Services, said in a report this year that it considered only five of Tesla\u2019s nine directors to be independent because of professional ties between two other directors and Musk. Denholm was one of the directors it said was independent.\n\nIn a letter last week, a group of investors that included officials associated with public pension funds in four states called for even more overhauls to the company\u2019s board than what the SEC settlement required. They requested that Tesla disclose a \u201crefreshment plan\u201d for Tesla\u2019s board, a permanent separation of the CEO and chairman\u2019s job, and other provisions.\n\n[These Tesla investors want even bigger changes to its board]\n\nNew York City Comptroller Scott M. Stringer, who is custodian of the city\u2019s pension fund and who also signed the letter, said in a statement last week that \u201ca truly independent and refreshed board with directors from diverse backgrounds would be able to provide the strong oversight the company clearly needs.

So of course I understand entirely how that should operate.\"\n\nThe comments, which come from a one-hour BBC documentary, \u201cPrince, Son And Heir: Charles At 70,\u201d mark the first time he has publicly addressed concerns that he could be a meddling monarch.\n\nUnlike his inscrutable mother Elizabeth, who can discuss issues like Brexit in neutral tones, Charles has triggered criticism \u2014 and praise \u2014 for his controversial views. Perhaps most famously, he once called a planned extension at London\u2019s National Gallery a \u201cmonstrous carbuncle.\u201d (The design was later scrapped.)\n\nThe expected future king also came under scrutiny after the publication of a cache of letters he penned to government ministers \u2014 dubbed the \u201cblack spider memos\u201d because of Charles\u2019s scrawled handwriting \u2014 that showed him to be a supporter of a number of causes.\n\n\u201cCharles will never be neutral just as he will never be party political,\u201d wrote Catherine Mayer in her book \u201cCharles: The Heart of a King.\u201d She continued: \u201cFor better or for worse \u2014 in my final analysis, more often for better than for worse \u2014 the Prince is a man with a mission, a knight on a quest.\u201d\n\nCharles, who turns 70 next week, is the longest-serving heir apparent in British history. In the BBC documentary, he said that he will operate within \u201cconstitutional parameters\u201d when he becomes monarch, which is a \u201ccompletely different\u201d role from being the Prince of Wales, as the heir in Britain is known.\n\n\u201cThe idea somehow that I\u2019m going to go on in exactly the same way, if I have to succeed, is complete nonsense because the two \u2014 the two situations \u2014 are completely different,\u201d he said, according to excerpts from the documentary released ahead of its broadcast Thursday evening.\n\nThe documentary features interviews with his sons Prince William, who said he would like to see his father spend more time with his grandkids, and Prince Harry, who praised his father for walking Meghan down the aisle when her own father couldn\u2019t make the wedding.\n\nWhile Charles said he understood that being king would be different from being heir, he did defend his activism.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s meddling to worry about the inner cities as I did 40 years ago,\u201d he said, \u201cif that\u2019s meddling, I\u2019m very proud of it.\u201d", "\n\nCoach Buzz Williams has directed the 15th-ranked Hokies to consecutive appearances in the NCAA tournament. (Chuck Burton/Associated Press)\n\nWhen Virginia Tech Coach Buzz Williams and several of his players arrived at Charlotte\u2019s Spectrum Center on Oct. 24 for ACC men\u2019s basketball media day, the Hokies had learned only a few days earlier they were ranked 15th in the country, tied for the highest spot in program history in the Associated Press preseason poll.\n\nThe accolade stemmed from Virginia Tech bringing back five of its top six scorers, including three starters, from a team that last season boasted victories over ACC blue bloods Duke, North Carolina and Virginia and earned a second consecutive appearance in the NCAA tournament.\n\nAll of which suggests a healthy state of affairs in the rebuild tasked to Williams when he arrived in 2014-15.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want it to sound as though, yeah, we had it all kind of mapped out,\u201d Williams said then, \u201cand we\u2019re the typical football coach that in May we\u2019re planning out what we\u2019re doing in training camp. It wasn\u2019t that.\n\n\u201cNot trying to say I\u2019m smart. I think that\u2019s why spending all your time planning, and then there\u2019s so many things that change that are out of your control.\u201d\n\nOne week after media day, Virginia Tech announced the indefinite suspension of guard Chris Clarke. The athletic department did not disclose circumstances surrounding the suspension of one of the featured members of Williams\u2019s first full recruiting class.\n\n[Virginia Tech 2018-19 men's basketball schedule]\n\nClarke averaged 8.2 points and a team-high 6.3 rebounds last season. He also was a key to last season\u2019s 64-63 home victory over Duke, scoring the final six points including the go-ahead tip-in with four seconds remaining.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 senior has battled injuries throughout his career at Virginia Tech (21-12 last season), starting with a broken foot in 2016, forcing him to miss a dozen games. The next season, Clarke tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during a double-overtime win against the Cavaliers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just so many variables that you can\u2019t control,\u201d said Williams, who has not addressed the suspension publicly heading into the season opener Friday night against visiting Gardner-Webb. \u201cAnd I think sometimes that\u2019s why you wake up a little earlier and try harder the next day.\u201d\n\nClarke\u2019s absence coincides with the comeback of guard Ty Outlaw. The NCAA granted Outlaw a sixth year of eligibility after he underwent surgery in July 2017 for a ruptured ACL in his right knee and sat out last season. The injury occurred during a pickup game.\n\nOutlaw had moved into the starting lineup after Clarke\u2019s ACL injury, making 32 of 50 three-point attempts over Virginia Tech\u2019s final eight games that season. The torrid shooting stretch included setting a school single-game record by making 8 of 10 from beyond the arc in a win against Miami.\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019re going to be ready when that first game comes,\u201d Outlaw said. \u201cBut right now I think we need to keep working on our defensive principles and taking up space and getting those rebounds. We know what we can do offensively. We know what our Achilles\u2019 heel is.\u201d\n\nOutlaw was referring to rebounding, a category of emphasis for the undersized Hokies.\n\nVirginia Tech finished last out of 15 schools in the ACC in rebounding margin last season (minus-1.5 per game) and second to last in offensive rebounding, averaging 7.4 per game. The Hokies were minus-17 in rebounding over their final four losses of the season, including a 26-22 deficit against Alabama in the NCAA tournament\u2019s round of 64.\n\nStill, the excitement around campus for basketball at a school recognized primarily for football has been noticeable, players said, given Virginia Tech\u2019s preseason ranking and a prediction of fifth place in the ACC in a preseason media poll.\n\nGuard Justin Robinson, meantime, was selected to the ACC\u2019s preseason second team after leading the Hokies in scoring (14 points per game), assists (5.6) and free throw shooting percentage (78.2). The senior finished second in the ACC in assists.\n\nThe Hokies also bring back four players who averaged in double-figure scoring last season.\n\n\u201cPeople look forward to basketball season now,\u201d said Hokies senior guard Ahmed Hill, who averaged 10.6 points per game. \u201cComing from freshman year when a lot of people didn\u2019t come to games, like people didn\u2019t even know who you were, to now people walk around like, \u2018Hey, I know you.\u2019\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re excited to see you, so it\u2019s a great feeling, honestly.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nCollege basketball wakes up to the Duke takeover\n\nCollege basketball is back.

But they\u2019re skeptical, telling him that their other options are \u201cyoung people in the gleam of their lives.\u201d He assures them that he is more experienced, wiser and more knowledgeable, but he is beginning to think those attributes may not be enough.\n\nHe wants to be young again, and he has the physical fitness to match, Ratelband said.\n\nHe has low blood pressure, he said. His joints are working well. His eyesight is clear. His mental health is in top shape, he reported. \u201cWell, everything, I guess,\u201d he said. \u201cI get it all checked every two years.\u201d\n\nThis is what he told officials at town hall, where he first went to ask for the change.\n\n\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d they inquired, rejecting his request. It wasn\u2019t his first brush with the officials at town hall. Many years ago, they refused to let him name his twins Rolls and Royce, after the carmaker. He continues to call them by these titles, but made their legal names France and Minou.\n\nThis time, he was undeterred, telling his lawyer that he wanted to take the matter to court.\n\nAdopting the playbook used by transgender people suing to alter their birth certificates, which often requires submitting to psychiatric evaluation, Ratelband agreed to see professionals to ensure he wasn\u2019t a \u201cvictim of the Peter Pan syndrome,\" as he put it. He convinced experts that he wasn\u2019t deluding himself, he said, and that he understood the consequences of his actions.\n\nAt first, he said, the judges \u201claughed like little girls.\u201d\n\nBut after he delivered an inspirational speech about how modern society had freed itself from the false gods of money and government and religion \u2014 \u201cnowadays, we are free people,\u201d he reportedly told them \u2014 they became more receptive, in his telling.\n\nRatelband\u2019s desire to remake himself is distinctly American, he said, and comes from his training under Tony Robbins, the motivational guru and master of the life hack. He lived and traveled with Robbins for about six months in the late 1980s, he said, and came to believe that \u201cyou have to make your dreams come true from visualization.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is American thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I change my age if I want to? You have to stretch yourself. If you think you can jump one meter, now I want to jump 20. If you earn 100 grand a month, now I want to earn 120 grand.\"\n\nHe drew a comparison to the forces elevating President Trump, arguing that people don\u2019t want to be told how to live or what to believe, and therefore appreciate that the president has cut himself loose from standards of decorum that governed past presidents.\n\n\u201cHe is just himself,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump is the first one who is honest. He shows his emotion on Twitter, saying to everyone, \u2018Shut up.\u2019 He\u2019s a new kind of person.\u201d", "BERLIN \u2014 Thirty people have gone on trial in western Germany for allegedly abusing migrants physically and mentally at an asylum center in 2014.\n\nThe defendants, who went on trial Thursday at the district court in the town of Siegen, include both security guards and employees at the center in Burbach, a small town about 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of Bonn.\n\nThe German news agency dpa reported that they are charged with 50 cases of illegal restraint, severe bodily harm and theft.\n\nThe case became public when a video showing scenes of the abuse was leaked to the media and created an outcry in the country.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(U.S. National Arboretum)\n\nFeatures reporter\n\nGood news, D.C. leaf peepers: Fall has finally arrived, and trees across the city are bursting into color. We may not have entire hillsides of fiery foliage, like you get on Skyline Drive, but what D.C. lacks in intensity we make up for in diversity. More than 350 different species of tree call the capital region home, and that results in a very long foliage season. Native trees like dogwoods and tupelos get it started in early October, and cold-hardy foreigners like the Japanese maple can keep it going well into December.\n\n\n\nA three-flowered maple bursts into color in the Arboretum's China Garden. (Sadie Dingfelder)\n\nD.C.\u2019s tree variety is due to our mild climate, international visitors who bring flora from their homelands, and the U.S. National Arboretum \u2014 446 rolling acres that are home to roughly 14,000 different species of plants, some of which are quite rare. So, when I wanted to see autumn in full flame last week, the Arboretum was my first choice.\n\nMy Uber driver, a lifelong D.C. resident, had never heard of the Arboretum. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked, surprised that his app was taking us to an otherwise industrial corner of Northeast D.C. When we rolled through the main gates, he was floored. \u201cThis is amazing! It\u2019s like a forest in a city!\u201d\n\n\n\nA gingko tree has been trained to grow flat against a wall. (U.S. National Arboretum)\n\nExcept the Arboretum isn\u2019t like any forest that nature would devise. Much of the landscape is neatly mown and regularly weeded by an army of volunteers, and its canopy is made up of international trees as well as ones that were Frankensteined in USDA laboratories. In fact, the Arboretum was founded largely as a place for Agriculture Department scientists to showcase new varieties of ornamental plants \u2014 created by crossbreeding (and, more recently, genetically engineering) flora to be more beautiful and hardy than their forebears.\n\nI bid my driver goodbye and pulled my bicycle out of his trunk. This is cheating, I know, but biking to the Arboretum means navigating busy highways and one vertiginous hill. Once you\u2019re inside the gates, though, cycling is a delight, and probably the best way to explore the Arboretum\u2019s 9 miles of meandering roads.\n\nFollowing the suggestion of the official Arboretum app, I biked to a place called Maple Hill and found a stand of trees ablaze in fall colors. Among the familiar oranges, yellows and reds was a tree that had turned an unusual purple-red. Unlike many trees at the Arboretum, this one didn\u2019t have a label. Luckily, the app includes a map of every single plant on the premises, so I was able to determine that my mystery tree was a Brandywine maple, a cultivar developed by Arboretum scientists in 1998 for pest resistance and distinctive, long-lasting fall color.\n\n\n\nA Japanese Maple bonsai tree begins to blush red. (Michael J. Colella)\n\nI sat down underneath a sugar maple and soon all the animals that had scattered upon my abrupt arrival resumed their daily routines. A flock of squabbling blue jays alighted on the grass near me, looking like pieces of sky falling to the ground, and a pileated woodpecker tapped out a message of doom to bugs hiding in the bark of a sugar maple. A huge vulture drifted by, looking thoughtful, perhaps also taking in the fall colors. I was jealous of his lofty perspective.\n\nWhere else should I go? My app sent me to the fall-blooming camellias, another Arboretum invention. They were less than a mile away, but I took a scenic route, biking past the Capitol Columns \u2014 22 Corinthian pilasters orphaned by a 1958 Capitol building renovation. In the fall, they look especially lovely, a tidy Roman ruin framed by golden grass and blue flowers \u2014 bluestar and aster, the app said.\n\n\n\nAt the U.S. National Arboretum, cold-hardy camellias bloom in the fall. (Sadie Dingfelder/Washington, D.C.)\n\nI made my way to the shady, terraced hillside that houses the Arboretum camellia collection \u2014 or what\u2019s left of it, anyway. In the late 1970s, a few bitterly cold winters killed almost all of the Arboretum\u2019s 900 camellias, a sign explains. One of the remaining plants, romantically called #162475, became the basis for an Arboretum program to breed cold-tolerant camellias. Perhaps it hasn\u2019t been cold enough for them yet \u2014 I only found a few of the white and pink flowers open among the glossy green leaves.\n\n\n\nA Japanese zelkova bonsai tree shows its fall colors at the National Bonsai & Penjing Museum.

He was convicted of apostasy and sentenced to death in December 2014. An appeals court later reduced his punishment to two years imprisonment, which he has served. However, he has not yet been released.\n\nMore than 150 cases of arbitrary arrests of human rights defenders have been recorded by Amnesty International since 2014. Amnesty called on Mauritania\u2019s financial and technical partners to apply more pressure to end slavery in the country.\n\nEarly this year, The African Union ruled the West African nation has not enforced its own anti-slavery laws after it passed out a lenient sentence to slave owners.\n\nThe U.S. in its statement this month said Mauritania is not making sufficient progress toward combating forced labor, including slavery.

The 2018 Global Slavery Index indicates that 90,000 people still live as slaves in Mauritania.\n\nThe Mauritanian government, however, denies that slavery is widespread in the country.\n\n\u201cMauritania has made great efforts to eradicate the aftermath of slavery and has achieved undoubtedly significant results in this regard,\u201d the government said in a statement.\n\nIt said the U.S. decision is motivated by misinformation, and that the government hopes that the Trump administration will reconsider its decision.\n\nU.S. imports from Mauritania of fish, fertilizers and mineral fuels were more than $61 million in 2017.\n\nFrancois Patuel, West Africa researcher for Amnesty International, said that while the group cannot take a position on sanctions, \u201cwe encourage Mauritania\u2019s financial and technical partners to continue to raise the issues of the persistence of slavery, discrimination and reprisals against human rights defenders during political dialogues.\u201d\n\nHe called on technical and financial partners to call on Mauritania to bring suspected slave owners to justice and \u201cto create a safe and supportive environment for activists.\u201d\n\n\u201cMauritania gets a lot of support because it is considered a key ally on the war on terror, both by the U.S. government and European governments,\u201d said Patuel. \u201cWe\u2019ve been telling them to make sure this isn\u2019t used as a carte blanche for authorities to do what they want without repercussions.\u201d\n\nHe said dialogue and pressure are needed to eradicate slavery.

(Alex Berliner/Invision for the Television Academy/AP)\n\nDonald Trump is the most laughed-about politician in any single year in the history of late-night comedy. That\u2019s what we found in our new study of 6,337 jokes during late-night monologues by four leading humorists during Trump\u2019s first year in office: Nearly half (3,128 or 49 percent) took aim at the president.\n\nHere\u2019s how we did our research\n\nThe study, which we conducted through the Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University, examined late-night political jokes aired between Jan. 23, 2017, the Monday after Trump\u2019s inauguration, through Dec. 31, 2017. We examined \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!,\u201d \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d with Trevor Noah, \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\u201d and \u201cThe Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon.\u201d We tracked the traditional joke formats, also known as \u201cone-liners,\u201d and the longer monologues commonly employed on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cDaily Show.\u201d (Our next step is to examine the once-a-week comedy programs, including \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d \u201cFull Frontal with Samantha Bee\u201d and \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d with John Oliver).\n\nLate-night comedians laughed at Trump himself more than at his policies\n\nMany of the jokes that focused on the president referred to policy, but the main target was the president and the administration, not policy itself. Just over half of those first-year jokes mentioned policy, with the greatest number of barbs targeting U.S.-Russia relations, health-care policy and Trump\u2019s on-again off-again bromance with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un.\n\nMore than 90 percent of the jokes about Trump referred to personal matters, such as the president\u2019s physical appearance, his celebrity status, his bluster, his rhetorical inconsistency and his chaos-filled administration.\n\nColbert, who rose in the ratings as his attacks on Trump intensified, told the most jokes about Trump during 2017, with 1,151 one-liners, making up 46 percent of his political jokes. Fallon did not tell as many jokes about Trump in total, his 690 Trump jokes accounted for 55 percent of his political jokes, tied for first place with Kimmel as the humorist most focused on Trump during the president\u2019s first year.\n\nTrump had already been a comic target as a candidate. Those four hosts told 1,817 jokes about Trump between Jan. 1 and Nov. 11, 2016, which included both the nomination and the general election campaigns. The 2016 total was the most jokes ever told about a presidential candidate during an election year going back to 1992. Apparently, the only person who can beat candidate Trump \u2014 in the late-night humor standings, at least \u2014 is President Trump.\n\nTo be sure, Trump\u2019s political rise took place during an era of white-hot political comedy. Not so long ago, the late-night comics offered relatively little political fare in their opening monologues. Now, the political zingers are blistering and come rapid-fire from these four prominent hosts.\n\nIn 2009, five late-night comedy program hosts \u2014 on \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d and \u201cLate Night\u201d on NBC \u2014 told 936 jokes about President Obama. That\u2019s far fewer jokes about Obama than just one of them \u2014 Stephen Colbert \u2014 told about Trump in 2017.\n\nSimilarly, the total number of first-year presidential jokes told about George W. Bush in 2001 and Bill Clinton in 1993 were fewer still. But then, late night humor was much tamer in those eras.\n\nLate-night humor is becoming more politically prominent\n\nUnfortunately for modern presidents, what happens on late night is not forgotten by the next morning. Major newspapers such as the New York Times and The Washington Post report on the highest-profile jokes and routines, and Americans regularly watch the most popular bits on their computers over the next day or so. Scholarly studies show that late-night political humor is becoming an evermore prominent part of political discourse, and these shows increase political interest among their viewers.\n\nThe former star of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d appreciates television\u2019s importance, and he tosses the insults right back at his late-night tormentors via Twitter. His feuds with the hosts, his political troubles and his own larger-than-life appetites make him perfect comic fodder \u2014 and so he is likely to dominate the late-night discourse as long as he serves. Being the biggest late-night comedy target ever may not be the brass ring Trump most wanted to grab. But he just doesn\u2019t know how to let go.\n\nRead more:\n\nStephen J.

The extremist group kidnapped a group of people this summer in Sweida, Syria. (SANA via AP)\n\nDespite President Trump\u2019s repeated claims that the Islamic State has been defeated, the militant group remains a deadly threat to minority populations in Syria, causing concern among U.S. lawmakers that recent atrocities are being overlooked.\n\nIn July, the Islamic State killed more than 200 people and took more than two dozen hostages in a rampage on Sweida, a city in southwestern Syria inhabited by members of the Druze religious minority. The attack was one of the single-biggest massacres of the Syrian civil war and a reminder of the threat posed by the Islamic State despite its loss of territory.\n\nLast week, a group of Democratic lawmakers urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and national security adviser John Bolton to condemn the attack and keep Washington\u2019s focus on ISIS, rather than expanding its mission to curbing Iran\u2019s presence in the country.\n\n\u201cWe write to express concerns regarding the administration\u2019s failure to condemn the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) attack against the Druze community in Sweida, Syria on July 25, 2018,\u201d the lawmakers, led by Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), said in a letter obtained by The Washington Post. \u201cWe also are concerned about recent reports that the administration has embraced an expanded mission in Syria beyond the complete defeat of ISIS, which may detract from protecting displaced persons and minority populations from ISIS\u2019s continued terrorist threat.\u201d\n\nA State Department spokesman said the United States is working on a response to the letter but noted that the Trump administration has been \u201cconsistent in condemning ISIS and the brutal and despicable tactics it has used.\u201d Without explicitly mentioning the Druze population, the spokesman said, \u201cWe stand with all communities that have been victimized by ISIS and will continue to do so.\u201d\n\nSyria\u2019s minority populations are worried that Islamic State militants are regrouping in remote areas of the country after being chased out of their strongholds by U.S.- and Syrian-backed forces. The Druze community had been desperately seeking support from the U.S., Russian and Syrian governments in securing the release of the Druze hostages among those captured by the Islamic State this summer. On Thursday, Syrian state media announced that the Syrian army freed 19 Druze women and children held by the Islamic State since the July attack.\n\nThe rescue followed the release of an online video earlier this week purportedly showing the assassination of a Druze woman who had been taken hostage. The extremists threatened to kill more hostages if the Syrian government did not free Islamic State fighters and their family members.\n\nAnger over the protracted hostage crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations had sparked a sit-in outside the Sweida governorate building, according to local reports, and young men had begun taking up arms.\n\nThe Islamic State killed two of the hostages as it pressured the Syrian government to bow to its demands. Two other Druze hostages are believed to have died from stress and other health-related issues. Last month, six Druze hostages were released in exchange for 17 wives or relatives of Islamic State members held by the Syrian government, as well as a dozen Bedouin captives taken by Druze fighters in the aftermath of the Islamic State attack on July 25.\n\nLast weekend, a deal collapsed between the Syrian government and the Islamic State to secure the release of seven Druze women and three children in exchange for 35 people related to Islamic State fighters, according to Talal Atrashe, a member of a prominent Druze family in Sweida.\n\n\u201cThe Syrian government refused to release 35 ISIS fighters, since the initial deal included only civilians,\u201d Atrashe said.\n\nHe said U.S. and Russian officials were involved in the negotiations but disagreed on several issues, including where to move Islamic State fighters who have threatened the Druze community.\n\nAlex Makled, a prominent member for the Druze community in the United States, said Russian officials expressed a willingness to cooperate with U.S. officials in an effort to free the hostages. However, coordination had been difficult as Washington remained uneasy about giving Moscow more room to maneuver in areas bound by a demilitarization agreement, Makled said.\n\n\u201cThe refusal of Washington to cooperate or coordinate with the Assad regime or Russia in the battle against ISIS has clearly left a big logistical hole through which ISIS is able to maneuver,\u201d said Joshua Landis, a Syria expert at the University of Oklahoma.\n\nIn the run-up to Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, Trump touted the Islamic State\u2019s defeat as an important reason to vote Republican.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve defeated ISIS. ISIS is defeated in all of the areas that we fought ISIS, and that would have never happened under President Obama,\u201d Trump told the Associated Press in a recent interview.\n\nIn last week\u2019s letter, Pallone and other Democrats argued that declaring the total defeat of the Islamic State risks masking the continued atrocities in Syria carried out by the group.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned the administration is conflating ISIS\u2019s loss of territory with its complete defeat while ignoring ISIS\u2019s sustained insurgent presence. This will continue to threaten the safety of displaced and minority populations like the Druze,\u201d said the lawmakers, who include Iraq War veteran Seth Moulton of Massachusetts.", "U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Cambodia Rhona Smith answers questions during a press conference in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018. (Heng Sinith/Associated Press)\n\nPHNOM PENH, Cambodia \u2014 The U.N.\u2019s specially appointed researcher on human rights in Cambodia expressed concern Thursday over the country\u2019s use of pre-trial detention and its failure to conduct trials speedily.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference at the end of an 11-day mission, Rhona Smith specifically expressed concern about people arrested in politically linked cases, including Kem Sokha, the former leader of the dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party.\n\nKem Sokha was freed on bail in September after being jailed without trial for a year on a treason charge, but the conditions of his release amount to a form of house arrest.\n\nSmith said a judge denied her request to meet Kem Sokha, and she called for him to be quickly brought to trial or released.\n\n\u201cAccess to justice also requires speedy trials and I am concerned at the time taken to conduct trials and the significant number of people in pre-trial detention,\u201d Smith said in a statement. \u201cI repeat my recommendations to use pre-trial detention only when absolutely necessary in accordance with Cambodia criminal procedure code; to carefully document the use of pre-trial detention; and to regularly review the ongoing need in each case.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s comments about Cambodia were unusually mild. U.N. human rights investigators are typically highly critical of Cambodia\u2019s restrictive political environment and harassment of critics and opponents. She told reporters that for her latest mission in Cambodia, she chose to focus on \u201cthe localization of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals,\u201d which means broadly addressing how human rights policies can contribute to a nation\u2019s overall social and economic development.\n\nCambodia was harshly criticized by many rights groups and Western nations for holding a general election in July that they judged unfair and undemocratic. The election extended the rule of Prime Minister Hun Sen into a fourth decade.\n\nThe only credible opposition force, the Cambodia National Rescue Party, was disbanded last year by the courts in a move seen as politically motivated. The 19 other parties that contested the election were seen as either having trivial support or being promoted by the ruling party to foster the illusion of democratic choice.\n\nThe government had already cracked down on the opposition last year as the ruling party\u2019s prospects for the general election were looking shaky. The opposition had made a strong showing in 2017 local elections, building on its surprisingly strong challenge in the 2013 general election.\n\nKem Sokha was arrested in September last year on the basis of years-old videos showing him at a seminar where he spoke about receiving advice from U.S. pro-democracy groups. His party denied the treason allegation, calling it politically motivated.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Concord has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe three-judge panel must answer the specific question of whether Mueller is a \u201cprincipal officer,\u201d requiring appointment by the president and Senate confirmation, or an \u201cinferior\u201d one, who can be appointed by the head of a department.\n\nTwo appeals judges \u2014 Srinivasan and Rogers \u2014 seemed skeptical of the argument from Concord\u2019s attorney that Mueller\u2019s appointment by the Department of Justice required a specific statute passed by Congress.\n\n\u201cDOJ hires private attorneys all the time,\u201d Rogers said.\n\nSrinivasan noted his own appointment as a former deputy solicitor general was not specified in law or approved by the Senate. \u201cDoes your position mean the appointment was invalid?\u201d he asked.\n\nIf the appeals court rules against him, Miller intends to ask to the Supreme Court for review, his attorney, Kamenar, said after court Thursday.\n\nThe appointments clause generally requires officers to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, but it allows for officials deemed \u201cinferior\u201d to be appointed by the heads of departments, the president or a court if they are supervised by a principal officer. If Mueller is a \u201cprincipal\u201d officer, his appointment is invalid because he was tapped by Rosenstein.\n\n[Another federal judge upholds constitutionality of Mueller appointment]\n\nIn a July ruling in Miller\u2019s case, Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl A.

(Khaled Ziad/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nDespite U.S. calls for a cease-fire, fighting is escalating in a strategic Yemeni port city, threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians and deepening a humanitarian crisis in which millions are at risk from a looming famine.\n\nThe clashes in Hodeida, pitting a U.S.-backed regional coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against northern Houthi rebels, have caused numerous civilian casualties over the past week, according to residents, health workers and aid agencies. The violence is also edging closer to medical facilities, threatening the safety of patients and medical workers.\n\nThe fighting has particularly intensified near Hodeida\u2019s port, through which passes more than 70 percent of all food, fuel, medicine and other essential supplies destined for the northern part of the country, where the large majority of Yemenis live. If the port is damaged, it could be catastrophic for millions of Yemenis, aid workers said.\n\n\u201cHodeida is once again trapped in violence with hundreds of thousands of Yemenis caught in the middle,\u201d Fabrizio Carboni, a senior official with the International Committee of the Red Cross, said in a statement Thursday.\n\nResidents said they remain confined inside their houses as battles rage outside. Houthi rebels have dug in, patrolling the streets in machine-gun-mounted pickups and deploying fighters in buildings, houses, even hospitals, prompting fears that they are using civilians as human shields.\n\nThe coalition, meanwhile, has conducted scores of airstrikes and deployed U.S.-made helicopters to target areas in and around Hodeida, including residential neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cWe have been receiving a lot of civilian casualties,\u201d said Mareb Almahweeti, a surgeon at a military hospital in the city, adding that many of the injured were struck by shrapnel from airstrikes.\n\n\u201cThe Apache helicopters are bombing many areas around the city most of the day,\u201d he added. \u201cWe also hear airstrikes most of the day. The bombing is closer than before.\u201d\n\nAfter besieging Hodeida over the summer, the coalition launched a new offensive a week ago, two days after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for a cease-fire and peace talks within 30 days. An array of militias, aligned with the UAE and the embattled Yemeni government, pushed forward into the city, backed by airstrikes and heavy artillery.\n\n[Graphics: Five reasons the crisis in Yemen matters]\n\nThe coalition of Sunni Muslim countries is seeking to oust the Shiite rebels and restore Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government, not least because the Houthis are widely said to be backed by Iran. The United States is aiding the coalition by refueling its warplanes and through intelligence and billions of dollars in arms sales.\n\nA senior Yemeni government official said the goal of the Hodeida offensive is to militarily weaken the Houthis and push them into negotiations. Hodeida\u2019s port is a vital source of funds and supplies for the rebels, and losing control over the city could deliver a hard blow to their military operations.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to take over Hodeida before the 30 days,\u201d said Moammar al-Eryani, Yemen\u2019s minister of information. \u201cIf Hodeida is freed, the Houthis will be forced to come and sit with us at the table.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the rebels\u2019 top leader, Abdulmalik al-Houthi, vowed in a televised address to fight back at whatever cost and urged supporters to \u201cmove seriously to counter the aggression on all fronts.\u201d\n\nThe rhetoric and escalating bloodshed are alarming the United Nations and Western aid agencies, which in most parts of Yemen are the sole institutions assisting the 14 million people \u2014 nearly half the population \u2014 who are on the brink of famine. More than 3 million Yemenis have fled their homes; hundreds of thousands more could soon follow if the battle for Hodeida continues, aid workers said.\n\n\u201cThe upcoming talks cannot be an excuse to disregard the laws of war that protect the lives of the Yemeni people,\u201d Carboni said. \u201cWars have rules, and parties to the conflict must respect them, even in the fiercest battles.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis new attack on Hodeida is brushing away the hope sparked by the recent announcement of the peace talks,\u201d he added.\n\n[U.S. allies have killed thousands of Yemeni civilians from the air. After 22 died at a wedding, one village asks, \u2018Why us?\u2019]\n\nInside Hodeida, anxiety is growing. The clashes have largely unfolded in the southern and eastern parts of the densely populated city, residents said. In the affected areas, shops are either closed early or shuttered altogether. Movement is limited.\n\n\u201cThere is a sense of fear among people from being hit by mortars or airstrikes,\u201d said Mazen Mujammal, a 21-year-old resident.\n\nIn the first six days of the new offensive, Doctors Without Borders treated 24 civilians for war injuries in Hodeida and 50 in the town of Mokha, the medical charity said in a statement. The aid agency Save the Children said that more than 150 people have been killed in recent days.\n\nSoon, aid workers worry, there could be fewer places to assist the population. The fighting is increasingly edging toward hospitals and health centers. On Wednesday, Save the Children reported that clashes damaged a pharmacy at one of its health facilities, adding that shelling also hit residential areas.\n\n\u201cThe lives of hundreds of thousands of people, roughly half of them children, are in danger,\u201d Save the Children said in a statement. \u201cArtillery shelling is being used heavily by all sides.\u201d\n\nOf particular concern is al-Thawra hospital, the biggest medical facility in the city. It is mere yards from a front line where clashes are erupting daily, aid workers said. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund said this week that the fighting is putting 59 children at the hospital, including 25 in the intensive-care unit, \u201cat imminent risk of death.\u201d\n\n\u201cMedical staff and patients in the hospital have confirmed hearing heavy bombing and gunfire,\u201d UNICEF said in a statement. \u201cAccess to and from the hospital, the only functioning one in the area, is now imperiled.\u201d\n\nMore children could be endangered. Hodeida and neighboring provinces are at the epicenter of the hunger crisis, accounting for 40 percent of the 400,000 children who suffer from severe malnutrition in Yemen, UNICEF said. The sickest are often taken to al-Thawra.\n\nAt Hodeida\u2019s 22nd May Hospital, there have been interruptions in medical services because of fierce fighting, the ICRC said.\n\nNow, there\u2019s a fresh concern.\n\nLast week, Houthi rebels arrived at the hospital and took up positions on its roof, making it a potential target of the Saudi-led coalition, said Amnesty International, the watchdog group. Scores of hospitals and health clinics have been destroyed or damaged by airstrikes or shelling since the war in Yemen began more than three years ago.\n\n\u201cThe hospital is full of injured civilians who have nowhere else to go for lifesaving medical care,\u201d said Samah Hadid, Amnesty\u2019s Middle East director of campaigns. \u201cAnyone attacking a hospital under these conditions risks responsibility for war crimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe laws of war demand that hospitals are not used for military purposes,\u201d she added.\n\nMore than half of Hodeida\u2019s 600,000 residents have fled the city, mostly in the summer before the initial offensive. But many of those who remain are finding it difficult to leave.\n\nAccording to Save the Children, temporary roadblocks erected by the warring parties were \u201cpreventing people from leaving or entering the city overnight, in effect trapping them in an active conflict zone.\u201d Clashes on shifting front lines also have blocked escape routes to the south of the city, while the rebels have planted mines along other paths out of the city, Amnesty said.\n\nThat leaves only one northern road out. But with fuel prices rising, and the Yemeni currency collapsing because of the war, many residents don\u2019t have the means to escape. Among them are those who returned last month during a lull in the fighting, residents said.\n\n\u201cThose who have come back cannot afford to leave again because they have exhausted their financial reserves,\u201d said Nabil Almahdi, 44, a resident.\n\nThe civilians in Hodeida are \u201ccompletely powerless and can only stay put to await their fate,\u201d Hadid said. \u201cTheir lives are in the hands of warring parties who have shown little or no regard for their duty to protect civilians.\u201d\n\nLise Grande, the top U.N. humanitarian official in Yemen, said: \u201cThe most vulnerable people in the whole country are sitting there in Hodeida. These are the poorest of the poor. And they can\u2019t get out.\u201d\n\nIf the offensive continues, she added, many of the sickest could die not only of hunger but also disease.\n\n\u201cCholera remains probably the biggest threat to people in Hodeida,\u201d Grande said. \u201cThe humanitarian programs that are operational there are making the difference in keeping them alive.\u201d\n\nRaghavan reported from Cairo.\n\nRead more\n\nSaudi role in devastating Yemen war under new scrutiny after Khashoggi killing\n\nAmid renewed Yemen offensive, U.N. warns of \u2018incalculable human cost\u2019\n\nU.S. approach to Yemen challenged as country splinters and government vanishes\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "\n\nSinger Kris Wu and model Karlie Kloss attend an album release party on Nov. 6 in New York. (Cassidy Sparrow/Getty Images for Interscope Records)\n\nHONG KONG \u2014 President Trump isn\u2019t the only American calling out his Chinese counterpart for unfair competitive practices.\n\nThe latest to fire shots? The camp of Ariana Grande, pop superstar.\n\nThe 25-year-old singer is embroiled in a transpacific spat this week after a string of singles from Canadian Chinese newcomer Kris Wu suddenly topped the U.S. iTunes store rankings, briefly knocking Grande \u2014 and Lady Gaga \u2014 out of the Top 10 and sparking allegations of foul play.\n\nAfter tracks from Wu\u2019s new \u201cAntares\u201d album swept the charts on Monday, Scooter Braun \u2014 agent to Grande, Justin Bieber and Kanye West \u2014 accused Wu on Twitter of using automated \u201cbots\u201d to artificially inflate sales in the United States, where he is relatively unknown. Braun later claimed that he didn\u2019t write the tweet and deleted it, but \u201cChinese bots\u201d nonetheless became a trending topic, and Grande not-so-discreetly fanned the flames by hitting \u201clike\u201d on a tweet that accused Wu of cheating.\n\nCue social media mayhem.\n\nOn the Chinese Internet, the episode has become one of the most hotly debated subjects, not just because legions of Wu\u2019s fans have sprung to his defense \u2014 they definitely have \u2014 but also because the fraud allegations appeared to touch a nerve in a country where faked box office receipts, faked e-commerce reviews and faked download numbers are recognized as tricks from an all-too-familiar playbook.\n\nTo be sure, Grande has been criticized herself for ploys such as bundling digital sales with tour tickets. And Wu, a 28-year-old known for his Auto-Tune-inflected rap verses and boyish looks, is a bona fide superstar in Asia with a large, and real, fan base.\n\nKnown as Wu Yifan in Chinese, Wu has sold out stadiums in China and South Korea, starred in a handful of hit films, performed with Pharrell Williams and recorded a chart-topping track with rapper Travis Scott to lay the groundwork for a push into the North American market.\n\nHis label, Universal Music Group, has defended the iTunes sales as legitimate and threatened legal action against those spreading \u201cmalicious\u201d rumors.\n\nBut many in China aren\u2019t convinced. They\u2019re embarrassed.\n\n\u201cWhat did we successfully export to the U.S. and Europe: Kris Wu\u2019s new song or our rotten fan culture?\u201d reads a headline in the Paper, a popular Shanghai-based news website.\n\n\u201cChinese fans\u2019 vote-rigging shocks American netizens: Do they hurt more than they help?\u201d says another on Sina, a leading news portal.\n\nAs other websites translated the Twitter chatter of Grande\u2019s American fans from English into Chinese, many Chinese Internet users were chagrined that the episode gave Americans a glimpse into the reality of their country\u2019s entertainment business.\n\nRigging rankings and manipulating opinion has long been a well-known phenomenon in China, despite efforts by authorities to crack down on it. In 2015, a film distributor reportedly faked $6 million worth of ticket sales to claim its animated comedy topped Hollywood\u2019s \u201cFurious 7\u201d at the Chinese box office. A year later, film authorities declared that a whopping 7,600 screenings of the kung-fu flick \u201cIp Man 3\u201d were faked.\n\nChina\u2019s Web mercenaries, known colloquially as \u201cInternet Water Armies,\u201d are notorious for pumping out fake reviews for e-commerce platforms such as Taobao and manipulating messaging boards, notably the now-defunct Digg. Beyond the commercial sphere, the biggest manipulator of online opinion is probably the ruling Communist Party, which employs 500,000 keyboard warriors to fabricate nearly 500 million social media posts a year, according to credible academic estimates.\n\nAs the controversy swirled around Wu this week, high-profile allies appeared to be in short supply. Lay Zhang, a fellow member in Wu\u2019s old boy band, Exo, came closest as he offered somewhat backhanded words of encouragement.\n\n\u201cFor someone who is making their debut in the U.S., it is quite normal that no one knows you in the beginning,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou should worry about your stage performances, rather than chart performances. And those who look down on all Chinese artists, get lost!\"\n\nOther Chinese celebrities simply reveled in schadenfreude.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be kind for once and remind Kris Wu\u2019s fans that your rigging of charts will by no means wake him up to the fact that his music is awful,\u201d said Chinese actor Chi Zi in a top Weibo post that was retweeted 22,000 times.\n\nHong Kong hip-hop artist Edison Chen chimed in in English: \u201cMoney can\u2019t buy u love, money can\u2019t buy u fame, money can\u2019t buy u charts.\u201d\n\nGrande returned to the top of the U.S. iTunes chart on Wednesday with a seemingly fitting single she had debuted live on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show.\u201d\n\nThe title?\n\n\u201cThank U, Next.\u201d", "Yemeni pro-government forces advance toward the port area of Hodeida on Wednesday amid battle for the city controlled by Houthi rebels. (Khaled Ziad/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nDespite U.S. calls for a cease-fire, fighting is escalating in a strategic Yemeni port city, threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians and deepening a humanitarian crisis in which millions are at risk from a looming famine.\n\nThe clashes in Hodeida, pitting a U.S.-backed regional coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against northern Houthi rebels, have caused numerous civilian casualties over the past week, according to residents, health workers and aid agencies. The violence is also edging closer to medical facilities, threatening the safety of patients and medical workers.\n\nThe fighting has particularly intensified near Hodeida\u2019s port, through which passes more than 70 percent of all food, fuel, medicine and other essential supplies destined for the northern part of the country, where the large majority of Yemenis live. If the port is damaged, it could be catastrophic for millions of Yemenis, aid workers said.\n\n\u201cHodeida is once again trapped in violence with hundreds of thousands of Yemenis caught in the middle,\u201d Fabrizio Carboni, a senior official with the International Committee of the Red Cross, said in a statement Thursday.\n\nResidents said they remain confined inside their houses as battles rage outside. Houthi rebels have dug in, patrolling the streets in machine-gun-mounted pickups and deploying fighters in buildings, houses, even hospitals, prompting fears that they are using civilians as human shields.\n\nThe coalition, meanwhile, has conducted scores of airstrikes and deployed U.S.-made helicopters to target areas in and around Hodeida, including residential neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cWe have been receiving a lot of civilian casualties,\u201d said Mareb Almahweeti, a surgeon at a military hospital in the city, adding that many of the injured were struck by shrapnel from airstrikes.\n\n\u201cThe Apache helicopters are bombing many areas around the city most of the day,\u201d he added. \u201cWe also hear airstrikes most of the day. The bombing is closer than before.\u201d\n\nAfter besieging Hodeida over the summer, the coalition launched a new offensive a week ago, two days after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for a cease-fire and peace talks within 30 days. An array of militias, aligned with the UAE and the embattled Yemeni government, pushed forward into the city, backed by airstrikes and heavy artillery.\n\n[Graphics: Five reasons the crisis in Yemen matters]\n\nThe coalition of Sunni Muslim countries is seeking to oust the Shiite rebels and restore Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government, not least because the Houthis are widely said to be backed by Iran. The United States is aiding the coalition by refueling its warplanes and through intelligence and billions of dollars in arms sales.\n\nA senior Yemeni government official said the goal of the Hodeida offensive is to militarily weaken the Houthis and push them into negotiations. Hodeida\u2019s port is a vital source of funds and supplies for the rebels, and losing control over the city could deliver a hard blow to their military operations.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to take over Hodeida before the 30 days,\u201d said Moammar al-Eryani, Yemen\u2019s minister of information. \u201cIf Hodeida is freed, the Houthis will be forced to come and sit with us at the table.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the rebels\u2019 top leader, Abdulmalik al-Houthi, vowed in a televised address to fight back at whatever cost and urged supporters to \u201cmove seriously to counter the aggression on all fronts.\u201d\n\nThe rhetoric and escalating bloodshed are alarming the United Nations and Western aid agencies, which in most parts of Yemen are the sole institutions assisting the 14 million people \u2014 nearly half the population \u2014 who are on the brink of famine. More than 3 million Yemenis have fled their homes; hundreds of thousands more could soon follow if the battle for Hodeida continues, aid workers said.\n\n\u201cThe upcoming talks cannot be an excuse to disregard the laws of war that protect the lives of the Yemeni people,\u201d Carboni said. \u201cWars have rules, and parties to the conflict must respect them, even in the fiercest battles.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis new attack on Hodeida is brushing away the hope sparked by the recent announcement of the peace talks,\u201d he added.\n\n[U.S. allies have killed thousands of Yemeni civilians from the air. After 22 died at a wedding, one village asks, \u2018Why us?\u2019]\n\nInside Hodeida, anxiety is growing. The clashes have largely unfolded in the southern and eastern parts of the densely populated city, residents said. In the affected areas, shops are either closed early or shuttered altogether. Movement is limited.\n\n\u201cThere is a sense of fear among people from being hit by mortars or airstrikes,\u201d said Mazen Mujammal, a 21-year-old resident.\n\nIn the first six days of the new offensive, Doctors Without Borders treated 24 civilians for war injuries in Hodeida and 50 in the town of Mokha, the medical charity said in a statement. The aid agency Save the Children said that more than 150 people have been killed in recent days.\n\nSoon, aid workers worry, there could be fewer places to assist the population. The fighting is increasingly edging toward hospitals and health centers. On Wednesday, Save the Children reported that clashes damaged a pharmacy at one of its health facilities, adding that shelling also hit residential areas.\n\n\u201cThe lives of hundreds of thousands of people, roughly half of them children, are in danger,\u201d Save the Children said in a statement. \u201cArtillery shelling is being used heavily by all sides.\u201d\n\nOf particular concern is al-Thawra hospital, the biggest medical facility in the city. It is mere yards from a front line where clashes are erupting daily, aid workers said. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund said this week that the fighting is putting 59 children at the hospital, including 25 in the intensive-care unit, \u201cat imminent risk of death.\u201d\n\n\u201cMedical staff and patients in the hospital have confirmed hearing heavy bombing and gunfire,\u201d UNICEF said in a statement. \u201cAccess to and from the hospital, the only functioning one in the area, is now imperiled.\u201d\n\nMore children could be endangered.

The Nation has been largely closed off to outsiders, making it impossible even for those who follow the movement closely to gauge its strength.\n\nFor Farrakhan, the height of his prominence came when he organized the 1995 Million Man March in Washington, a symbol of black pride and empowerment.\n\nEarlier on his trip to Iran, state television published a short video clip of Farrakhan trying to say \u201cDeath to Israel\u201d in Farsi, a common chant at rallies in the decades after Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Stocks are opening modestly lower on Wall Street as the market gives back some of its big gains from the day before. (Richard Drew/Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Stocks in the U.S. are slipping Thursday afternoon after a big rally the day before. Energy companies continue to fall with the price of oil, which has dropped 20 percent since early October. Technology and internet companies are also down. The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, as expected, but traders still think it will raise rates again in December.\n\nStocks have surged over the past week as the market recovered from its October swoon, and they jumped a day ago following the U.S. midterm elections.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: The S&P 500 index shed 13 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,800 as of 3 p.m. Eastern time. The S&P 500 jumped 2.1 percent Wednesday. That was its sixth gain in the last seven trading days, a rally that\u2019s helped stocks make up a lot of the ground they lost in October.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 59 points, or 0.2 percent, to 26,120. The Nasdaq composite dipped 59 points, or 0.8 percent, to 7,511 after it surged 2.6 percent a day earlier. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks slipped 7 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,574.\n\nStocks climbed Wednesday after the midterm elections generally went the way investors thought they would. The Democrats took control of the House of Representatives while the Republicans held on to a majority in the Senate. That means that politics appears that much less likely to crowd out the performance of the strong U.S. economy. A Federal Reserve meeting ending Thursday is not expected to result in an interest rate hike.\n\nCOMM ON: Chipmaker Qualcomm had a stronger-than-expected fourth quarter, but investors were startled by its forecasts for the current period. It\u2019s projecting revenue of $4.5 billion to $5.3 billion, far below the $5.6 billion analysts expected, according to FactSet. Its stock lost 8.2 percent to $58.04.\n\nApple stopped making royalty payments to Qualcomm following a dispute between the companies, and later decided to stop using Qualcomm modems in some of its products. Qualcomm said both of those changes have hurt its results.\n\nBONDS: Bond prices were steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 3.23 percent. The Federal Reserve left interest rates where they are, but suggested it plans to keep raising rates in response to the strong U.S. economy. The Fed has raised its key rate eight times since late 2015 and is expected to do so again in December, with several more increases to follow.\n\nBanks made small gains as long-term interest rates remained near highest levels of this year. High-dividend stocks fell. Southern Co. lost 0.9 percent to $46.58 and timberland real estate owner Weyerhauser dipped 1.4 percent to $27.12. Those stocks climbed in October as the rest of the market dropped because investors consider them safe options, but they\u2019ve faded recently as stocks stabilized and high-growth companies started to do better.\n\nTHE QUOTE: Stocks started sinking last month because investors worried that the Fed was going to raise interest rates to the point they slowed down economic growth. But John Lynch, chief investment strategist at LPL Research, said he doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen and that the Fed will stop raising rates in 2019.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe they will be as aggressive as many fear,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have anything approaching the wage pressures that have historically scared the Fed.\u201d\n\nThe Fed has been raising rates so it can prevent inflation from getting out of hand. Lynch said that inflation isn\u2019t going to get much stronger because wages aren\u2019t going to grow much faster than they currently are. He said factors like the retirement of more Baby Boomers, global competition, and slower economic growth in the U.S. will all limit increases in pay.\n\nHOME WRECKED: D.R. Horton, one of the largest homebuilders, fell 9 percent to $34.23 after its earnings and sales fell short of Wall Street forecasts. The company said rising home prices and mortgage rates are affecting demand. That exact combination has been weighing on home sales and the stocks all year.

Government fuel stockpiles have expanded and the U.S. issued waivers to a number of countries that allow them to continue importing oil from Iran in spite of renewed sanctions on that country.\n\nWholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.64 a gallon.

But as journalists around the world themselves have increasingly become targets, many of them have wondered at what point it is justified to put down the pen and speak up \u2014 and they have come to very different conclusions.\n\nIn Germany, a group of regional reporters decided that this point had come in May, when the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party announced during a news conference that a reporter with the top-selling Bild tabloid would not be allowed to ask questions during the event. The reporter excluded from the press briefing, Michael Sauerbier, had asked critical questions during a previous press event about a senior AfD official\u2019s alleged ties to a right-wing extremist group.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time that reporters had been excluded by the AfD, but with attacks mounting and the rhetoric sharpening, all journalists in the room immediately agreed on what to do. They left the room; the news conference was canceled.\n\nIf any of those present at the time were watching the testy exchange between President Trump and CNN White House reporter Jim Acosta on Wednesday, they might have had some flashbacks to that day in May.\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s post-midterms news conference, Acosta asked whether Trump had \u201cdemonized immigrants\u201d by calling a caravan of Central American migrants \u201can invasion.\u201d When a White House intern attempted to take back the microphone, Acosta resisted by raising his arm.\n\n\u201cPardon me, ma\u2019am,\u201d he told the woman.\n\nTrump\u2019s response was less subtle. \u201cCNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them. You are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn\u2019t be working for CNN. You\u2019re a very rude person,\u201d Trump told Acosta. Trump had long pondered the possibility of taking away credentials from journalists. \u201cWhy do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt? Take away credentials?\u201d he asked on Twitter this May.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, the White House appeared to follow through with those threats for the first time, when it suspended Acosta\u2019s press credentials in an unprecedented move.\n\nIn other nations where far-right parties are openly threatening democratic principles or where journalists have to fear for their lives, Acosta was widely celebrated on Thursday morning. Meanwhile, in India, his combative questioning of the president earned him fans on social media, where some praised his willingness to take on the commander in chief.\n\nUS Media vs Indian Media pic.twitter.com/NoeaQn47eX \u2014 Roshan Rai (@RoshanKrRai) November 7, 2018\n\nOne user created a video clip contrasting Acosta\u2019s questions with footage from an event in 2015, when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosted a holiday event for journalists \u2014 and they mobbed him to take selfies. Modi has not held a news conference where journalists could freely ask questions during his entire time in office.\n\nForeign journalists were not alone in their support for Acosta. During the testy Wednesday news conference, the reporter Trump called on next immediately rushed to his colleague\u2019s defense. But should U.S. correspondents go down the path of their foreign colleagues and boycott briefings?\n\nThe bar for such action has been relatively high abroad. In one case, foreign journalists walked out of an Israeli news conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Australian counterpart, Malcolm Turnbull, last year after guards ordered a strip search of a European Press Agency photographer. The incident was later described as \u201cneedless and humiliating\u201d by the country\u2019s Foreign Press Association, and coverage of it embarrassed the Israeli government.\n\nIn the case of the German AfD incident, the walkout appears to have had impact, too. Senior party officials recently held a roundtable discussion with leading German editors, with the expressed aim to encourage more moderate dialogue, even though the \u201cfake news\u201d slogans have not faded from the streets.\n\nThe AfD and Trump are, of course, hardly comparable. Trump has at times engaged with the media and at other times lashed out at them. He has threatened to sue outlets but has not followed through, so far. The AfD, meanwhile, is an opposition party with limited influence.\n\nWhen former U.S. press secretary Sean Spicer excluded several news organizations from an off-camera press briefing last February but invited conservative publications to join, only a few media outlets decided to boycott the event. The reasons for refraining to boycott the briefing were diverse: Some argued that continuing to cover the administration was more important than setting an example. Other, more polarized news outlets appeared pleased to be favored.\n\nIn contrast, Germany has a more moderate media landscape, in which far-left or right-wing publications and networks have so far gained little traction. German journalists often issue statements through joint umbrella associations when they fear violations of press freedom, regardless of their papers\u2019 editorial stances.\n\nIn response to the May incident, one such association issued a clear directive to its members: \u201cWe ask all our members only to attend AfD events if all attending journalists have the right to ask questions.\u201d\n\nJoanna Slater in New Delhi contributed to this report.

Here\u2019s why.\n\nTrump\u2019s North Korea diplomacy quietly stalls\n\nLife under Kim Jong Un", "In July 2017, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) assured us there would be \u201choly hell to pay\u201d if President Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Key GOP senators said they wouldn\u2019t even hold hearings on a replacement. Even a few months ago, two rank-and-file Republican senators warned that they might not vote to replace Sessions if Trump fired him. They worried \u2014 either publicly or privately \u2014 that Trump would use the move to interfere with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump effectively fired Sessions \u2014 but without much GOP pushback. And the new acting attorney general, as some feared, will reportedly take oversight of the Russia investigation from Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein.\n\nIt is a huge, Trump-forced overhaul of an investigation involving himself \u2014 an event perhaps on a par with the firing of FBI Director James B. Comey. Except this time the reaction was more muted.\n\nThe episode is perhaps the most pronounced example to date of how Trump desensitizes the public and GOP senators, sometimes over many months, into accepting some of his most controversial ideas.\n\nTrump needled and attacked Sessions publicly for well more than a year. Most times, talk turned to whether Sessions would survive \u2014 whether Trump had finally had enough of the man whose recusal from the Russia investigation Trump had acknowledged as his chief complaint against the attorney general.\n\nThe suggestions \u2014 often implicit rather than directly floated \u2014 seem outlandish and ridiculous at first, and they draw the condemnations and cautions you\u2019d expect, even from Trump\u2019s Republican allies. But then Trump keeps at it. As he bangs the drum over and over, the innuendo becomes less newsworthy, fewer news media consumers tune in, and the apocalyptic predictions begin to seem repetitive or even overwrought. GOP senators lose the will to fight Trump, perhaps recognizing that he is going to do anyway whatever he aims to do or that it is no longer worth spending their time and political capital to try to stop him. Trump forces them to prove they\u2019re serious about standing in his way; they seldom are.\n\nAnd in the case of Sessions, Republicans started bargaining with Trump. You can do it, senators like Graham began suggesting back in August, but just not before the 2018 midterm elections. The rhetorical deal they cut with Trump was so obvious that virtually nobody was surprised Trump let Sessions go this week. It might have been surprising that it came just a day after the election, but we knew it was probably coming very soon.\n\nLet\u2019s take this all back to the summer of 2017. Graham said at the time that Trump\u2019s firing Sessions would be \u201cthe beginning of the end\u201d of his presidency. Trump had just fired Comey, and then suggested that he had done it because of the Russia investigation. Given that Trump had repeatedly bemoaned Sessions\u2019s recusal from that probe, it would have been obvious what Trump was up to.\n\nBut is it any less obvious today? Trump has also successfully targeted Comey\u2019s chief deputy at the FBI, Andrew McCabe, who was fired the day before his retirement benefits kicked in. He has also mused about getting rid of Rosenstein. And he has not really enunciated any new reasons for getting rid of Sessions, apart from the Russia probe. Just three weeks ago, in an interview with Fox News, Trump again made clear that his chief complaint was with Sessions\u2019s not being in place for the Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cJeff Sessions should have never let it happen; he should have never recused himself,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI mean, here\u2019s a man who recused himself. Why wouldn\u2019t you say, \u2018I\u2019m going to recuse myself\u2019? I wouldn\u2019t put him in that position.\u201d\n\nJust as with Comey, Trump had signaled that the termination was, at its core, about Russia. The narrative did not change. But Trump did draw out the string on it \u2014 to the point where what had once seemed shocking became significantly less so.\n\nThat may not matter, legally speaking, in how Mueller might view Sessions\u2019s removal in the context of obstruction of justice. But this will ultimately be up to Congress, through possible impeachment proceedings, which means public perception matters. And for the better part of 16 months, Trump has steadily diluted this issue to the point where people \u2014 and GOP senators \u2014 are suddenly willing to swallow it.", "North Korea used the DPRK-Cuba summit to display this first official portrait of Kim Jong Un, alongside that of President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel https://t.co/krWdxE4nQh pic.twitter.com/iGxSpir6A5 \u2014 NK NEWS (@nknewsorg) November 6, 2018\n\nIn North Korea, you\u2019re never far from a Kim.\n\nPortraits of late leaders Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung hang in nearly every office, school and public space, and couples are given a copy on their wedding day. \u201cKim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il are considered to be gods\u201d in North Korea, Je Son Lee, a defector who fled the country in 2011, told NK News. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have to have their portraits, in order to be with them all the time.

(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News)\n\nThe U.S. midterm elections are over, but many Americans \u2014 and people around the world \u2014 are still worried about \u201c fake news, \u201d particularly disinformation. Now that social media has replaced mainstream news outlets as the most common source of information about our world, how can a reader know the difference between fact and conspiratorial fiction?\n\nNick Adams of Goodly Labs may have an answer. With colleagues, he has put together a tool called Public Editor that helps ordinary citizens to vet the quality of online news articles. I recently reached out to Nick with questions. What follows is a lightly edited version of our online conversation.\n\nJoshua Tucker: What is Public Editor?\n\nNick Adams: Public Editor is a free online system allowing the public to take more responsibility for vetting the news articles that so many of us are reading, liking and sharing through social media. It takes in a news article, and 30 minutes later, after a lot of well-organized volunteer effort, the article is covered with labels pointing out fallacies and biases in its content, issues with tone, and even subtle inferential mistakes.\n\nIt also gives the article a 0-100 credibility score that content platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter can use to promote higher-quality articles in their search results and news feeds. And all of Public Editor\u2019s labels and scores will appear automatically over news content for readers who install our browser plug-in.\n\nJT: What led you to want to create Public Editor?\n\nNA: My commitment to the project really kicked into high gear as \u201cfake news\u201d and misinformation became a hot issue around the 2016 elections. But Public Editor really began as a sort of back-burner project for me and Nobel Prize-winning physicist Saul Perlmutter back in 2015. At that time, I was in the process of creating collaborative software (called TagWorks ) that people can use to deeply analyze documents \u2014 tons of documents \u2014 with the help of Internet-based workers.\n\nBack then, I was a fellow at the UC Berkeley Institute for Data Science , where Saul is still director. He asked me if the software might be useful for teaching the students in his own very popular critical thinking course to find examples of thinking errors in the news.\n\nWe started hashing out some designs. Once it become clear that some bad actors had weaponized news-sharing through social media to intentionally misinform voters, my nonprofit citizen science lab, the Goodly Labs, really kicked into high gear on the project.\n\n[Blame Fox, not Facebook, for fake news]\n\nJT: How can volunteers on the Internet be utilized for a task as complex as identifying the reliability of news?\n\nNA: Well, science is a process of inquiry anyone can use to test out the validity of some idea. And people do little bits of science all the time \u2014 maybe some household experiment with the vegetables to see if they keep fresh better on the counter or in the fridge. But too many people feel like science is only for experts in ivory towers. Certainly, academics are often great scientists. They are usually building on and improving centuries of carefully sedimented knowledge. But a lot of scientific work \u2014 if it\u2019s well-organized \u2014 can absolutely be done by citizens, by everyday people.\n\nAt the Goodly Labs, we don\u2019t put untrained citizens in charge of our statistical analyses, but we can get their valuable help collecting and curating data. Birdwatching societies have been doing this for hundreds of years to track migratory patterns. And Chris Lintott, the British astronomer behind Galaxy Zoo, has gotten citizens to accurately classify millions of galaxies. Now, we\u2019re getting the help of citizens to measure the features of the social world we all participate in creating and interpreting.\n\nJT: So what exactly are these volunteer workers doing as part of the Public Editor process?\n\nNA: There are a number of different tasks volunteers can perform. In every case, Public Editor presents some passage of text to the volunteer \u2014 sometimes a full article, but usually a shorter passage \u2014 and asks them to look for different types of information. Prompted by a series of questions, the volunteers hunt for information in the text that might reveal problems with language or tone, reasoning errors, improper use of evidence, or mistaken reasoning about probabilities.\n\n[Fake news is about to get a lot worse. That will make it easier to violate human rights \u2014 and get away with it.]\n\nJT: So what sort of public participation is needed to make this work, and how do you can think you can achieve these levels of participation?\n\nNA: We believe that we can label and score somewhere between one-third to two-thirds of any given news reader\u2019s content just by evaluating the top 100 most-shared articles per day. That could have a substantial positive impact. Since an article often remains most-shared for a couple days or so, we\u2019re really talking about evaluating an average of 50 articles per day. It only takes 40 people working in parallel to evaluate an article. That means we would need 2,000 people to spend 15 minutes each day in Public Editor.\n\nWe think we can achieve that with some good recruitment campaigns. Tens of millions of people do the crossword or Sudoku each day, and those puzzles are usually more complex and time-consuming than the tasks we\u2019re asking people to perform. Public Editor tasks give people a similar sense of accomplishment. That feeling is compounded when volunteers know their work is improving democracy, when they\u2019re earning points and badges they can brag about on Facebook, and when they get to reap the rewards of their teamwork every time they start reading a popular news article.\n\nJT: How can people get involved as public editors, and what does this entail?\n\nNA: Anyone interested in volunteering should click the \u201cContact Us\u201d button of our website \u2014 publiceditor.io . There\u2019s plenty to do! It\u2019s really simple. We give folks a little packet of information explaining the system, have them watch a seven-minute training video, and get them going on tasks. Beginners are totally encouraged to learn by doing. We give a lot of structured feedback, and we don\u2019t start counting a volunteer\u2019s work until they have built up their own confidence \u2014 usually after a dozen or more tasks. Everything is designed to be learning-friendly and low-stress, while also engaging and challenging.\n\nThis article is one in a series supported by the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Opening Governance that seeks to work collaboratively to increase our understanding of how to design more effective and legitimate democratic institutions using new technologies and new methods. Neither the MacArthur Foundation nor the network is responsible for the article\u2019s specific content.

Someone started throwing himself against the front door and actually cracked the front door.\u201d\n\nHis wife, thinking it was a home invasion, locked herself in the pantry and called 911, Carlson said. The couple have four children, but none were home at the time.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t a home invasion. It was a protest.\n\nAccording to now-deleted social media posts shared by Smash Racism D.C., a local anti-fascist organization whose members have been tied to other demonstrations against prominent Republican figures, activists showed up outside Carlson\u2019s home Wednesday and they had a message for him.\n\n\u201cTucker Carlson, we are outside your home,\u201d one person could be heard saying in the since-deleted video. The person, using a bullhorn, accused Carlson of \u201cpromoting hate\u201d and \u201can ideology that has led to thousands of people dying.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want you to know, we know where you sleep at night,\u201d the person concluded, before leading the group to chant, \u201cTucker Carlson, we will fight! We know where you sleep at night!\u201d\n\nRoughly 20 people had gathered outside Carlson\u2019s residence, said Lt. Jon Pongratz of the D.C. police. Authorities received a call at about 6:30 p.m. Wednesday and responded \u201cwithin a few minutes,\u201d Pongratz told The Post.\n\nCarlson said the protesters had blocked off both ends of his street and carried signs that listed his home address. The group called Carlson a \u201cracist scumbag\" and demanded that he \u201cleave town,\u201d according to posts on Twitter. A woman was also overheard in one of the deleted videos saying she wanted to \u201cbring a pipe bomb\u201d to his house, he said.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a protest. It was a threat,\u201d said Carlson, who is often denounced by critics, particularly liberal ones, for his rhetoric about immigrants and minorities on his Fox News show. \u201cThey weren\u2019t protesting anything specific that I had said. They weren\u2019t asking me to change anything. They weren\u2019t protesting a policy or advocating for legislation. ... They were threatening me and my family and telling me to leave my own neighborhood in the city that I grew up in.\u201d\n\nHe added that he still does not know who was behind the protest, but plans to find out.\n\nOn Twitter, Smash Racism D.C. accused Carlson of spreading \u201cfear into our homes\u201d every night, taking particular issue with his comments about the migrant caravan.\n\n\u201cTonight you\u2019re reminded that we have a voice,\u201d a now-deleted tweet read. \u201cTonight, we remind you that you are not safe either.\u201d\n\nThe host\u2019s address, as well as the addresses of his brother and good friend Neil Patel, with whom he co-founded the conservative media site the Daily Caller, were shared in tweets from Smash Racism DC\u2019s account.\n\nIn a Facebook post that included video of the gathering, the group wrote, \u201cFascists are vulnerable.

In the aftermath of the war, he was tried and convicted of treason. Had it not been for his advanced age (was nearly 90 at the time), he would have been executed.\n\nOn Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron came under fire for endorsing the idea that France should pay tribute to P\u00e9tain during a ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the 1918 Armistice that ended World War I. But by the end of the day, amid a torrent of criticism, the \u00c9lys\u00e9e was forced on the defensive, backtracking from the president\u2019s words and asserting that P\u00e9tain would not be honored.\n\nBefore he became head of the Vichy government, P\u00e9tain was a military hero from World War I, having made his name at Verdun, the longest battle of the war. More than 300,000 soldiers \u2014 French and German alike \u2014 died in that battle, one of the bloodiest in the war.\n\n\u201cIt was never part of the plan to honor P\u00e9tain,\u201d an \u00c9lys\u00e9e source told The Washington Post, noting that P\u00e9tain will not be included in a Saturday morning ceremony that will honor other World War I heroes.\n\nBut Macron\u2019s words had suggested otherwise, and set off a national firestorm.\n\n\u201cHe was a great soldier,\u201d Macron said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reality.\u201d P\u00e9tain, Macron had originally suggested, would be recognized along with seven other marshals who led successful military campaigns during the war. Army sources had also told French media that P\u00e9tain was on the list.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s legitimate that we pay homage to the marshals who led the army to victory,\u201d Macron had told reporters.\n\n\u201cPolitical life, like human nature, is sometimes more complex than we would like to believe,\u201d Macron said. \u201cI\u2019ve always looked the history of our country in the face.\u201d\n\nThose remarks outraged Jewish groups and a number of historians, who saw the move in keeping with a recent wave of historical revisionism. It also drew coverage from nearly every major French newspaper and elicited widespread condemnation on social media.\n\nAmong the loudest critics was Macron\u2019s predecessor, former president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who issued a scathing statement on Wednesday night. \u201cHistory does not isolate a single stage, even a glorious military career,\u201d Hollande wrote, in remarks posted on Twitter. \u201cIt judges the immense and unworthy responsibility of a marshal who deliberately used his name and prestige as a cover for treason and the collaboration and deportation of thousands of Jews of France.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only thing I want to remember about P\u00e9tain is that in 1945 he was an incarnation of national shame, which makes him ineligible for any tribute,\u201d said Francis Kalifat, the president of the Representative Council of French Jewish Organizations (CRIF), France\u2019s largest Jewish advocacy group, in a statement.\n\nLate Wednesday, the \u00c9lys\u00e9e backtracked from the president\u2019s initial words in response to the criticism, emphasizing in a slew of social media posts that P\u00e9tain will not, in fact, be honored in a Saturday ceremony. But the affair, however small, reopened a long-standing debate about the wounds of the past.\n\nThe Vichy regime is notorious for having pursued, largely independent of German pressure, its own slew of anti-Semitic legislation in keeping with the \u201cNational Revolution\u201d it sought to inspire.\n\nThe \u201cStatut des Juifs,\u201d passed in two separate junctures in October 1940 and June 1941, banned Jews from public life and the free professions. Vichy also pursued the agenda of \u201cAryanization,\u201d under which French authorities liquidated Jewish property to enrich the coffers of the state.\n\n\n\nGerman Chancellor Adolf Hitler shakes hands with Head of State of Vichy France Marshall Philippe P\u00e9tain, in occupied France, Oct. 24, 1940.

(AP)\n\nIn general, the memory of World War II ranked for decades among the most explosive topics in French public life. For years, admirers \u2014 including former French presidents \u2014 left flowers on P\u00e9tain\u2019s grave every year, on the anniversary of the Armistice.\n\nThat practice came to an abrupt end in 1992, when Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, a Socialist president who had served in the Vichy administration between 1941 and 1943, succumbed to public pressure. In 1995, President Jacques Chirac ended decades of ambiguity by declaring that Vichy was, in fact, the French state and that the deportation of Jews during the war was France\u2019s fault.\n\nIn recent years, however, there has been an attempt to rehabilitate P\u00e9tain, mostly on the extreme right.\n\nThe convicted Holocaust denier and National Front co-founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, for instance, wrote fondly of the wartime leader in a memoir published earlier this year; the right-wing commentator \u00c9ric Zemmour did much the same in a book published in September.\n\nP\u00e9tain, Zemmour wrote, was \u201cdouble-dealing,\u201d somehow attempting to rescue the country and French Jews, from behind the scenes. The vast majority of the Jews deported from France never returned.\n\nThese are no longer fringe opinions: Both Zemmour\u2019s book and Le Pen\u2019s memoirs were instant bestsellers.\n\nFor many, the question is whether Macron\u2019s since retracted decision would somehow endorse a reconsideration of P\u00e9tain. When pressed by journalists, the 40-year-old president went on the defensive immediately. \u201cI\u2019m not hiding any page of history,\u201d he said.\n\nFor some historians, however, the problem is the potential effect of Macron\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the statement comes from the president of the Republic,\u201d said Laurent Joly, an expert in the history of Vichy France and the author of a new book on Vichy anti-Semitism. \u201cIf the army had sought to commemorate P\u00e9tain, no one would have reproached them.\n\n\u201cBut there has been a consensus since 1992.

(Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg News)\n\nNEW DELHI \u2014 In the United States, Nov. 8, 2016, is remembered as the day Donald Trump was elected president. In India, it is the day that cash disappeared.\n\nExactly two years ago, India embarked on one of the boldest economic policy moves the world has seen in decades: The government abruptly invalidated the two most popular bank notes in circulation in what Prime Minister Narendra Modi described as a strike against corruption and illegal assets.\n\nThe result was chaos as Indians rushed to exchange useless bills for new ones. ATMs were closed for two days; then people had to stand in line for hours to withdraw even small amounts of cash. Small businesses could not pay their workers and farmers struggled to sell their crops.\n\nNow the battle over the legacy of \u201cdemonetization,\u201d as it is known in India, is raging once again.\n\n\u201cIt is often said that time is a great healer,\u201d said Manmohan Singh, Modi\u2019s predecessor as prime minister, in a rare statement released Thursday. But \u201cthe scars and wounds of demonetization are only getting more visible with time.\u201d\n\nAn economist by training, Singh is a member of the Indian National Congress, which now sits in opposition to Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. Singh noted that economic growth fell in the wake of the currency ban and said that many small and medium-size businesses had yet to recover fully from the shock.\n\n\u201cToday is a day to remember how economic misadventures can roil the nation for a long time and understand that economic policymaking should be handled with thought and care,\u201d Singh continued.\n\nArun Jaitley, the current finance minister, launched his own defense of the currency ban, which invalidated the former 500 and 1,000 rupee bills (which together represented 86 percent of the country\u2019s bank notes by value). Jaitley said Thursday that the move had pushed Indians to reduce their reliance on cash and open bank accounts while increasing tax collection.\n\nBut none of those objectives were cited by Modi when he first announced the ban one evening two years ago in a dramatic televised address. Instead he portrayed it as an attack on \u201cblack money,\u201d or undeclared assets hidden from the authorities to avoid taxes, and as a move against terrorist funding and counterfeiting. He called it \u201ca grand sacrifice for cleansing our country.\u201d\n\nYet there is no evidence that tax evaders, money launderers and terrorists were left sitting on useless piles of cash. A report from India\u2019s central bank in August showed that nearly all of the invalidated currency \u2014 99.3 percent of it \u2014 ultimately returned to banks. That means illicit assets were either not held in cash or people found ways to launder such stashes.\n\nThe Modi government is \u201cstill in denial of the absolute catastrophic effect that this move had on the economy and on the people of India,\u201d said Meera Sanyal, a former banker and the author of a new book called \u201cThe Big Reverse: How Demonetization Knocked India Out.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow when you have all the evidence that this simply did not work, they still, like ostriches, are refusing to see what it did.\u201d", "In this Nov. 5, 2018 photo Walter Frankenstein, born in 1924, witness of the Nov. 9, 1938 terror against Jews in Berlin and one of the few survivors of Auerbach\u2019sches Waisenhaus orphanage shows a box with the Yellow badge the Nazis forced him to wear and with the Germany\u2019s Federal Cross of Merit he got 2014, during an interview with the Associated Press in Berlin. Frankenstein witnessed as the orphanage was attack by a Nazis during the terror night of Nov. 9, 1938. (Markus Schreiber/Associated Press)\n\nBERLIN \u2014 Walter Frankenstein was 14 years old when a police officer came to the Jewish orphanage he was living at in Berlin, urging all children to leave the building immediately because \u201csomething bad will happen tonight.\u201d\n\nIt was early evening, November 9, 1938. Later that night, he climbed up on the roof of the orphanage and saw fire lighting up the city.\n\n\u201cThen we knew: the synagogues were burning,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next morning, when I had to go to school, there was sparkling, broken glass everywhere on the streets.\u201d\n\nFrankenstein, now 94, was describing Kristallnacht \u2014 the \u201cNight of Broken Glass\u201d \u2014 when Nazis, among them many ordinary Germans, terrorized Jews throughout Germany and Austria. They killed at least 91 people and vandalized 7,500 Jewish businesses. They also burned more than 1,400 synagogues, according to Israel\u2019s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.\n\nUp to 30,000 Jewish men were arrested, many taken to concentration camps such as Dachau or Buchenwald. Hundreds more committed suicide or died as a result of the mistreatment in the camps years before the official mass deportations began.\n\nAs Germany marked the 80th anniversary of the anti-Jewish pogroms this week with a series of memorial events, Frankenstein returned to the place where he witnessed the violence as a teenager.\n\nOne of the dwindling number of Holocaust survivors, Frankenstein needed a walker as he slowly entered the compound where the Auerbach\u2019sches Waisenhaus orphanage once stood. But his memory is still sharp, and he remembers exactly how the events unfolded that night.\n\n\u201cA few hours after the plain clothes police officer had warned us, a group of men in uniforms came and told us, \u2018you need to leave now, we want to set fire to the building,\u2019\u201d Frankenstein said during an interview with The Associated Press this week.\n\nThere would have been no way to take the youngest children to a safe place that quickly, he said. Frankenstein and some of the older boys at the home managed to convince the uniformed men, who belonged to the paramilitary SA, that if they burned down the orphanage the fire would spread to surrounding buildings.\n\n\u201cSo instead, they went into our synagogue and turned off the sanctuary light in front of the holy ark,\u201d Frankenstein said. \u201cThey did not turn off the gas and after they left, we suddenly could smell gas everywhere inside the building.\u201d Frankenstein and his peers ran inside the synagogue, tore open all windows, and turned off the gas before it could lead to an explosion.\n\n\u201cThe men probably thought that if enough gas would stream out, the building would blow up,\u201d he said.\n\nKristallnacht is often referred to as the beginning of the Holocaust. It would still be years before the Nazis formally adopted their \u201cFinal Solution\u201d for the Jews of Europe, when boycotts, anti-Semitism legislation and expulsions would evolve into a policy of mass murder. In all, 6 million European Jews were killed in the Holocaust.\n\nGuy Miron, who heads Israel\u2019s Yad Vashem\u2019s Center for Research on the Holocaust in Germany, said Kristallnacht represented an end to Jewish life in Germany, a point of no return.\n\n\u201cUntil then, the Jews could still try to convince themselves that the wheel could be turned back. After it, the rupture was complete. They realized it was over,\u201d he said at a Yad Vashem event this week marking the anniversary. \u201cBefore Kristallnacht people emigrated. After it, they fled.\u201d\n\nStanding under an old poplar tree shedding its bright yellow leaves, Frankenstein gazed at a red brick wall \u2014 the only remainder of the orphanage in the city\u2019s Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood. The building was badly destroyed during a World War II air raid in 1943, and the ruins were torn down in the 1950s.\n\nThe wall was turned into a memorial for those Jewish orphans who did not survive the Holocaust, with the names and ages of 140 children inscribed on the bricks. The youngest one, Cilla Fuks, was ten months old when she was murdered.\n\nFrankenstein was one of the few who survived. In 1943 he went into hiding with his wife Leonie, whom he had met at the orphanage, as the Nazis were deporting thousands of Jews from Berlin to Auschwitz.\n\n\u201cWe had promised ourselves not to do what Hitler wanted,\u201d he said, still feisty after all these years. \u201cSo we went into hiding.\u201d\n\nTogether with their newborn son Uri, the couple spent 25 months in hiding in Berlin. A second son, Michael, was born in 1944, during their time on the run.\n\nIn 1945, after the collapse of the Nazis\u2019 Third Reich, the Frankensteins immigrated to what was then still Palestine. Eleven years later, in 1956, they moved from Israel to Sweden where they settled for good.\n\nNowadays, Walter Frankenstein returns to Germany several times a year. He often talks to schoolchildren about his life and on Friday, the anniversary of November 9, 1938, he will be honored in an award-giving ceremony by Germany\u2019s Culture Minister Monika Gruetters.\n\nIn 2014, he received Germany\u2019s highest civil honor, the Federal Cross of Merit.\n\nEvery time Frankenstein travels to Berlin, he brings along the small blue case containing the cross.

Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said Thursday morning that investigators have not been able to determine a motive.\n\nThe bloodshed spread throughout the Borderline Bar & Grill, a popular nightspot in Thousand Oaks, Calif., a city near Los Angeles. When the gunfire began, people were line dancing during the venue\u2019s \u201cCollege Country Night,\u201d witnesses said. That detail evoked the massacre of 58 people at a country-music festival in Las Vegas a little more than a year earlier \u2014 a connection deepened when some of those who escaped Borderline said they had also survived that massacre.\n\nPolice said Long, wearing a black sweater and wielding a .45-caliber Glock handgun with an extended magazine, approached the bar and shot a security guard standing outside. He then headed in and shot other employees before turning his fire on patrons, Dean said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horrific scene in there,\u201d Dean, who is set to retire Friday night, told reporters. \u201cThere\u2019s blood everywhere.\u201d\n\n[Guard, officer killed in the nation\u2019s latest mass shooting, stoking debate about active-shooter defenses]\n\nThe gunfire set off a panic, as patrons grimly familiar with stories of shooting rampages at churches, schools, movie theaters, offices and other locations across the country scrambled for safety and shelter.\n\n\u201cThey ran out of back doors, they broke windows, they went through windows, they hid up in the attic, they hid in the bathroom,\" Dean said. \"Unfortunately, our young people, people at nightclubs, have learned that this may happen. They think about that. Fortunately, it probably saved a lot of lives that they fled the scene so rapidly.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Ginsburg, 23, said he hid under a table and then, hearing gunfire from the front, ran with other people toward the rear exits. Teylor Whittler, 19, said a man named Ethan \u201cpicked me up because I kept getting ... trampled,\u201d carrying her out the back door and saving her life. She said many people then hid behind bushes, in their cars or underneath the vehicles in the parking lot.\n\nAmong the dead was Ron Helus, a veteran sergeant in the Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Office who was mortally wounded when he responded to the incident just minutes after 911 calls began flooding in, authorities said.\n\nHelus and a Highway Patrol officer headed into the club and exchanged fire with the attacker, Dean said. Helus, a 29-year veteran of the force with a grown son, had been on the phone with his wife when he got the call about the shooting and headed to the club, Dean said. During the shootout, he was struck several times.\n\n\u201cHe died a hero,\u201d Dean said, his voice cracking, \u201cbecause he went in to save lives.\"\n\n[Her 4th day of college was a mass shooting. Here is what life is like as a survivor.]\n\nThe carnage added Thousand Oaks to the seemingly endless list of American cities to experience a mass shooting. This violence came just days after 11 people were gunned down in a Pittsburgh synagogue, months after 17 students and staff were massacred in a Parkland, Fla., high school and a year after rampages in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, Tex., killed a combined 84 people.\n\nThe latest attack carried echoes and reminders of others. The descriptions of chaos inside the club were similar to those reported during the slaughter of 49 clubgoers at Pulse nightclub in Orlando in 2016; the rampage in California occurred about 100 miles away from a community center where 14 were killed during a 2015 terror attack in San Bernardino, Calif.\n\nDean alluded to these earlier attacks, saying the carnage in Borderline \u201cis part of the horrors that are happening in our country and everywhere, and I think it\u2019s impossible to put any logic or any sense to the senseless.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by a reporter what it looked like inside the venue, Dean responded: \u201cLike hell.\u201d\n\n[The 12 lives lost in the California bar shooting]\n\nCalifornia Gov.

One person had a minor gunshot injury, he said.\n\nCody Coffman, a 22-year-old who had been talking to recruiters about fulfilling his dream of joining the Army, was among those killed, his father said Thursday morning.\n\n\u201cI am speechless and heartbroken,\u201d Jason Coffman said outside the Thousand Oaks Teen Center, where families were gathering in the wake of the attack.\n\nCoffman, at times so overwhelmed he could not speak, leaned on his father-in-law to steady himself. He said he last saw his son as the younger man was heading out last night.\n\n\u201cThe last thing I said was, \u2018Son, I love you,'\u201d he said.\n\nSarah Deson, 19, said Cody Coffman stood in front of her as the shooter approached from the front entrance. Coffman yelled for everyone to get down and told her to run for the front door as the shooter moved farther into the bar, she said.\n\n\u201cCody saved so many people last night, he was shielding people and getting them out,\u201d she said.\n\nA group of more than a dozen people walked out of one building at the center huddled together. The teen center had become a de facto staging ground for relatives because authorities were notifying families and close friends there about victims. Families could be seen crying and hugging each other; outside, a man with a hoodie pulled up over his head sat on the curb while another man sat nearby and placed a hand on his shoulder.\n\n[A stark, white room: Sutherland Springs still struggles with church massacre]\n\nWhat could have motivated the attack remained a mystery to authorities, Dean said. The FBI said it was processing the crime scene at the bar as well as the attacker\u2019s home and vehicle at the request of Dean\u2019s office and would pursue leads \u201cto identify any possible motivation.\u201d\n\nThe Marine Corps said Long served between August 2008 and March 2013.

(Czarek Sokolowski/Associated Press)\n\nWARSAW, Poland \u2014 A Polish court on Thursday overturned a Warsaw city ban on a march organized by far-right nationalist groups, justifying the decision on constitutional grounds of the freedom of assembly.\n\nThe decision by Judge Michal Jakubowski is the latest development surrounding contentious, confusing preparations for an Independence Day march on Sunday in the Polish capital to honor the country\u2019s 100 years of independence.\n\nFor the past decade, far-right nationalists have been organizing marches on the Nov. 11 Independence Day in Warsaw, and this year fears of open demonstrations of extremism and possible clashes with counter-protesters threatened to overshadow all other events on the nation\u2019s centenary calendar.\n\nLast year marchers carried xenophobic banners proclaiming the desire for a \u201cWhite Europe\u201d that drew international criticism, especially coming only a few months after a violent rally of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nPolish government officials had tried for months to persuade the nationalists to make the Warsaw march this year an inclusive affair involving state officials without any provocative banners but the two sides were unable to agree.\n\nOn Wednesday, Warsaw\u2019s city mayor stepped in and banned the march, citing security reasons. The president and prime minister then quickly announced that an inclusive state march would take place instead Sunday along the same route, led by President Andrzej Duda and including the prime minister, other top leaders and World War II veterans.\n\nAfter the court ruling, it wasn\u2019t immediately clear if both marches will go ahead separately, or as one.\n\nThe uncertainties about security had been heightened by a mass walk-out by police officers in recent days over pay, prompting the government to ask the Defense Ministry to help with security on Sunday. But late Thursday a police union announced it was ending the protest after agreeing upon a deal with the Interior Ministry.\n\nThe Warsaw court ruling follows a similar ruling in Wroclaw on a city ban on a nationalist march there for Sunday.\n\nCity authorities still have the right to appeal the rulings.\n\nWarsaw city spokesman Bartosz Milczarczyk said \u201cwe respect the court\u2019s verdict.\u201d He said town hall officials were studying it before deciding whether to appeal.\n\nEarlier in the day, before the ruling, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said authorities would do everything in their power to crack down on any expressions of extremism at the march.\n\n\u201cWe want the march to be peaceful and not provoke tensions,\u201d Morawiecki told reporters.\n\nHis comments come amid other signs that Poland\u2019s conservative ruling Law and Justice party is now seeking to take a firmer stance against ultra-nationalists after a period in which they seemed to be trying to appease them.\n\nExtremists from Hungary and elsewhere have in past years joined Poland\u2019s Nov. 11 march, which is meant to mark Poland\u2019s regaining of its independence at the end of World War I.\n\nSaying he expected up to 200,000 participants Sunday at the inclusive Warsaw march, Morawiecki acknowledged it could be hard to control them all, but said \u201cwe will try to eliminate all banners which are extremist.\u201d\n\nHe also said there will be no tolerance for foreign neo-fascists or other agitators.\n\nMany other World War I centennial events are expected across the country on Sunday, with the most emotional expected to be the public singing of the national hymn at noon in hundreds of places.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

He was given the rank of sergeant, but he later was demoted when he wrote a letter home critical of the conditions in the war.\n\nSoon after, he was thrown into the biggest U.S. battle of the war, the Meuse-Argonne offensive in northeastern France.\n\nThere were reports he was still brooding over his demotion right on Nov. 11. When he emerged from a thick fog in the valley around Chaumont-devant-Damvillers, he and his comrades faced a German machine gun nest on the hillside.\n\nIndications are that the Germans fired one salvo over his head as a warning, knowing the war was almost over. But he still charged onward.\n\n\u201cHis time of death was 10:59 a.m., which is just so haunting,\u201d Bennett said. Gunther was recognized by Pershing as the last American to die on the battlefield.\n\nQuestions remain whether it was a suicide run, an attempt at redemption or an act of true devotion.\n\n\u201cIt is just as puzzling now as it was 100 years ago,\u201d Bennett said, adding that one thing is clear: \u201cGunther\u2019s act is seen as almost a symbol of the futility of the larger war.\u201d\n\nBut there was one more cruel twist for his family: They were unaware he had been killed.\n\nUpon his expected return \u201cthey went to the train station to meet Henry \u2014 not there!\u201d said Bruce Malone, superintendent of Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery, the final resting place for 100 Americans who died Nov. 11.\n\n___\n\n\u201cA NEED TO KILL ONE LAST TIME\u201d\n\nThere was no mystery surrounding the death of Price, the Canadian. It was an utterly senseless loss of life.\n\nHe was a farm laborer in Saskatchewan when the swirl of history plucked him off the land in October 1917 as the Allies sought ever more manpower for the Western Front.\n\nThe summer after he was drafted, he was part of the surge of victories that seized villages and cities right up to Nov. 11. By that time, Canadians were retaking Mons in southern Belgium, where soldiers from the British Commonwealth had their very first battle with the Germans in August 1914.\n\nIt was especially sweet for the Commonwealth commanders to retake the city, bringing the war full circle where they lost their first soldier, English Pvt. John Parr, on Aug. 21, 1914.\n\nPrice decided to check out homes along the canals while civilians in the center of Mons had already broken out the wine and whiskey they had hidden for years from the Germans to celebrate with the Canadians.\n\nSuddenly, a shot rang out and Price collapsed.\n\n\u201cIt really was one man, here and there, who was driven by vengeance, by a need to kill one last time,\u201d said Belgian historian Corentin Rousman.\n\nThe final minutes counted not just for the casualties but also for the killers.\n\n\u201cThere are rules in war,\u201d Rousman said. \u201cThere is always the possibility to kill two minutes before a cease-fire. Two minutes after, the German would have had to stand before a judge. That\u2019s the difference.\u201d\n\nAt the St. Symphorien cemetery just outside Mons, Price, the last Commonwealth soldier killed in the war, lies a stone\u2019s throw from Parr, the first.\n\n\u201cHe is not forgotten,\u201d Rousman said of Price. \u201cIt\u2019s a soldier whose tomb is often draped in flowers.\u201d\n\n___\n\n\u201cPART OF THIS GREAT PATRIOTIC MOMENTUM\u201d\n\nTrebuchon\u2019s grave stands out because of the date, underscoring the random fortunes of war.\n\nHe was a shepherd from France\u2019s Massif Central and could have avoided the war as a family breadwinner at age 36.\n\n\u201cBut he was part of this great patriotic momentum,\u201d said Jean-Christophe Chanot, the mayor of Vrigne-Meuse, where he died.\n\nTrebuchon knew misery as part of France\u2019s most brutal battles \u2014 Marne, Somme, Verdun. He survived right up to his last order \u2014 to tell soldiers where to gather after the armistice.\n\nInstead, his body was found with a bullet wound to the head. He was recognized as \u201cthe last French soldier killed during the last French attack against the Germans,\u201d Chanot said.\n\nThe date on his grave \u2014 Nov. 10, 1918 \u2014 remains controversial, even if it was meant to soothe a family\u2019s sorrow.\n\n\u201cIt was a lie, without a question,\u201d said Czubak, the French historian.\n\n___\n\nPhotojournalist Virginia Mayo and video journalist Mark Carlson contributed.\n\n___\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press\u2019 WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___\n\nWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition.

The country\u2019s leader was hunched over on the podium before reporters. CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta gripped a microphone and fired off a tough question.\n\n\u201cWhy do you have Cuban political prisoners?\u201d Acosta asked. \u201cAnd why don\u2019t you release them?\u201d\n\nIt was March 2016 in Havana. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro were holding a joint news conference to mark the American president\u2019s historic visit to the island nation. Castro, the longtime, strongman head of an oppressive regime infamous for squashing dissent and muzzling the press, was clearly uncomfortable fielding questions from a journalist. As the New York Times reported at the time, it was a first time a foreign reporter had addressed Cuban leadership since the 1950s.\n\nBut handlers did not swoop in to grab Acosta\u2019s microphone. The reporter \u2014 whose own father was a Cuban exile \u2014 was not hauled out of the room. His credentials were not tossed. Instead, the Cuban leader grumbled out a non-answer. \u201cGive me a list of the political prisoners and I will release them immediately,\u201d Castro said.\n\nFast-forward two years, and Acosta had a very different experience Wednesday tangling with presidential power on-air.\n\n\n\nCNN correspondent Jim Acosta speaks on camera before the daily press briefing at the White House, in August. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nFollowing the mixed-results of this week\u2019s midterm elections, President Trump held a news conference that quickly descended into a full-contact grudge match against Democrats, failed Republicans candidates and the press.\n\n\u201cCNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them,\u201d Trump thundered to Acosta after the reporter asked a question about the president\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric on immigration. \u201cYou are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn\u2019t be working for CNN.\u201d\n\nHours later, Acosta announced the White House had suspended his press credentials. In a statement, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Acosta had lost his hard pass after \u201cplacing his hands on a young woman\u201d who was trying to take away the reporter\u2019s microphone during his testy back-and-forth with Trump.\n\n\u201cThis is a lie,\u201d Acosta stated on Twitter, later explaining to CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper that the White House was \u201ctrying to shut us down. I think they\u2019re trying to send a message to my colleagues.\u201d\n\nAcosta\u2019s yanked credentials have created a firestorm in media circles \u2014 and pulled much of the press focus off the midterm results and the abrupt dismissal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. It\u2019s also the latest cycle in the reporter\u2019s complicated relationship with the administration. Depending on your political stripes, the move was either a dangerous attack on the First Amendment, or a showboating reporter\u2019s comeuppance.\n\nSince 2016, Acosta has become one of the press corps' most high-profile members, regularly sparring with administration officials, such as Sanders and White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller. For Trump \u2014 who repeatedly vents his anger at the press and CNN in particular \u2014 Acosta is a convenient foil. But the reporter\u2019s bulldog reporting style has made him a household name.\n\n\u201cI probably receive more death threats than I can count,\u201d Acosta told Variety this year. \u201cI get them basically once a week.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s a precursor to Acosta\u2019s style in the White House media landscape, it was Sam Donaldson. During the latter part of the Reagan administration, the president would go months between taking questions from the press. The ABC White House correspondent began lobbing questions at President Ronald Reagan during public appearances.\n\n\u201cDonaldson has been both praised and panned for his aggressive reporting on a distanced President, for shouting questions at Reagan in a megaphone voice that can be heard even above the helicopter rotors when the Reagans take off for Camp David,\u201d the Christian Science Monitor wrote in 1987.\n\nAcosta, who grew up in Washington area and graduated from James Madison University, first landed at CNN in 2007 after a number of years working for local and network television stations. At the network, he began covering political stories, including Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign and the Obama White House, according to a Politico profile published last year.\n\nThe reporter\u2019s first memorable on-air brush with Trump set the stage for much of their later relationship. In May 2016, Acosta asked the candidate about media attention.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve watched you on television,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cYou\u2019re a real beauty.\u201d\n\nAcosta has not wilted when faced with Trump\u2019s jeremiads against his press coverage. Rather, like his encounter with Castro, he\u2019s doubled down by challenging Trump\u2019s statements in on-air confrontations that are packed with tension \u2014 TV-ready exchanges that perfectly encapsulate the president\u2019s fraught relationship with the press. \u201cWhen the president of the United States calls the press \u2018fake news\u2019 and \u2018the enemy of the American people,\u2019 . . . I think that\u2019s when you have to get tough and ask the hard questions,\u201d Acosta told The Washington Post in 2017.\n\nA perfect example arrived just days before Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2017, when the reporter and president-elect sparred over the allegations contained in the infamous Steele dossier published by BuzzFeed.\n\n\u201cNot you. Your organization is terrible,\u201d Trump said to Acosta, as the reporter attempted to ask a question.\n\n\u201cSince you\u2019re attacking us, can you give us a question? Mr. President-elect, since you\u2019re attacking our news organization, can you give us a chance?\u201d the reporter replied.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to give you a question,\u201d Trump shot back. \u201cYou are fake news.\u201d\n\nSince then, Acosta has regularly sparred with Trump. Following the violent \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville last year, Acosta checked Trump when the president asserted there were \u201csome very fine people on both sides.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir, there are no fine people in the Nazis,\u201d Acosta retorted.\n\nThe reporter similarly lobbed pointed questions at Trump during the president\u2019s summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. The exchange led Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale to call for Acosta to \u201cimmediately have his press credentials suspended.\u201d\n\nAcosta tapped out a quick retort on Twitter.\n\n\u201cDear Brad,\u201d he wrote. \u201c[D]ictatorships take away press credentials.

(John Wessels/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe current Ebola outbreak in Congo threatens to become uncontainable \u2014 because of politics, not the disease itself.\n\nOn Aug. 1, the Congo Ministry of Health declared an Ebola outbreak in North Kivu province, which is in the northeastern part of the country. This is actually the Congo\u2019s second Ebola outbreak in 2018; the earlier one on the other side of the country in Equateur province was brought under control in only three months.\n\nThe North Kivu outbreak is unrelated to the outbreak in Equateur, and it is proving far more difficult to stop. As of Oct. 4, the World Health Organization has identified 300 cases of Ebola and 186 deaths so far \u2014 and there are no signs that the outbreak is slowing down.\n\nNorth Kivu is a conflict zone\n\nEbola outbreaks are tricky to contain in the best of circumstances \u2014 but North Kivu presents a host of challenges. While health-care workers are seeing positive signs from their use of experimental Ebola vaccines, containment relies on providing supportive care when people get sick and contact tracing to keep a close eye on people at risk of getting sick. This means the community needs health-care facilities and people on the ground, and this is the problem.\n\n[Why this strain of Ebola will be far more difficult to stop]\n\nNorth Kivu is simultaneously dealing with an Ebola outbreak and internal conflict. The region has been the site of ongoing violence for more than 20 years. While popular press accounts tend to blame the conflict on competition for natural resources, more careful analysis links the conflict to issues of land access, relationships with the central government in Kinshasa, and revenue streams from taxation and transportation schemes to explain the informal \u201ceconomies of violence\u201d generated by competition among at least 132 militias in North and South Kivu, at last count.\n\nHealth-care workers\u2019 safety is at risk\n\nAs a result, at least 1 million of the province\u2019s 8 million residents are displaced, and many have fled across international borders. This makes it incredibly difficult to conduct effective contact tracing operations or maintain health-care facilities. The United Nations worries that this could cause the outbreak to spread across the border into Uganda. The Ugandan government has started vaccinating health-care workers near the border, as a precautionary measure.\n\nThe conflict has also complicated vaccination and prevention efforts. Increasing violence in and around Beni, the North Kivu city where WHO teams are based, has forced health workers to suspend their operations. Community members attacked three Congolese Red Cross volunteers trying to assist with a burial, and one of the rebel militias shot and killed two health-care workers in late October.\n\nLocal politicians have stirred up opposition to health workers, claiming that they are stealing organs \u2014 or deliberately infecting people with Ebola. The local political dynamics at play in Congo are making any sort of response more difficult.\n\nThe United States has withdrawn health experts\n\nThis is where the international community could provide assistance by offering personnel, diagnostic assistance and financing. Instead, the U.S. government\u2019s response has been to withdraw from the region \u2014 though other governments have kept personnel in place.\n\nIn mid-October, the Trump administration barred U.S. health experts from working in Beni \u2014 pulling back from the front lines of the response experienced people who have dealt with Ebola outbreaks elsewhere. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , said that he wanted the experts to remain in the field, but that Trump administration officials overruled him on security grounds.\n\nAlthough it is true that North Kivu is a dangerous region, other governments and nongovernmental organizations have not withdrawn. Canada and Britain have personnel in the region, as do Doctors Without Borders and the Gates Foundation.\n\n[Ebola is back \u2014 and a threat to people in Congo. Are African public health systems ready?]\n\nOne analyst attributed the Trump administration\u2019s decision as reflecting \u201cthe post-Benghazi hangover of the US government\u2019s risk aversion.\u201d Interestingly, in a 2014 interview, Trump cited Benghazi as one of the reasons he didn\u2019t trust the Obama administration\u2019s response to the West African Ebola outbreak.\n\nOther analysts see the administration\u2019s unwillingness to address Ebola as part of a larger pattern. In May, during the first Ebola outbreak in Congo this year, Trump asked Congress to rescind $252 million in Ebola funding to cut \u201cexcessive spending.\u201d This funding had been set aside for building local capacity and improving surveillance capabilities to respond to future Ebola outbreaks \u2014 exactly the sort of thing that the global community learned from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and is needed to address this current outbreak.\n\n[When the U.S. funds global health, other countries do too]\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton has also dismantled the NSC\u2019s global health security and biodefense directorate, moving those experts to other areas of the NSC staff and arguably weakening the U.S. government\u2019s global health response capabilities.\n\nThese steps are worrying for Congo \u2014 and elsewhere\n\nWhat do these actions mean for the outbreak? As Stephen Morrison and Judd Devermont of the Center for Strategic and International Studies argued last week, an effective response to this Ebola outbreak will need to addresses security concerns, strengthen local response capabilities, and build trust with local communities.\n\nWhile the United States is providing some support to those working on the frontlines of the crisis, the United States could still do much more by affirming that stopping the outbreak is in the U.S. national interest and embedding security personnel in the MONUSCO peacekeeping operation. All these efforts would bolster the international response without putting CDC workers in the field\n\nThe Ebola outbreak in the Congo won\u2019t magically end if the U.S. does get more involved. But the United States is a long-recognized leader in global health. If it chooses to remain disengaged, that could be worrisome for the future of global health.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This post has been updated with further information about the U.S. response.\n\nJeremy Youde is an associate professor of international relations at the Australian National University.

Norway\u2019s military says the 127-man crew on a Navy frigate has been evacuated after the ship was rammed by a Malta-flagged tanker while docked in a Norwegian harbor. Seven people were slightly injured. (Marit Hommedal/NTB Scanpix via AP) (Associated Press)\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark \u2014 A Norwegian Navy frigate carrying a crew of 137 was rammed by a tanker while in a harbor on the country\u2019s west coast Thursday, tearing a large hole in its side, the military said.\n\nEight people on the KNM Helge Instad were slightly injured \u2014 two of whom were taken to a nearby hospital \u2014 in the 4 a.m. accident in Sture, north of Bergen, said Rear Adm. Nils Andreas Stensoenes, the head of Norway\u2019s Navy.\n\nThe crew were evacuated amid fears the vessel would sink. The ship, which had recently taken part in the vast NATO drill Trident Juncture in Norway, is \u201cstrongly listing,\u201d Stensoenes told a news conference Thursday afternoon. The frigate was lying in the water almost on its side with its stern under the water.\n\nThe Maltese-flagged tanker, Sola TS, was not damaged and its 23-man crew remained on board. The shipping site Sysla reported that the tanker had been loaded with crude oil and was on its way to Britain.\n\nStensoenes said the cause of the accident was not clear and the Navy would wait for the findings of Norway\u2019s Accident Investigation Board. Earlier reports had said a towboat was also involved in the accident, but Stensoenes denied this.\n\nSome 10,000 liters of helicopter fuel from the frigate\u2019s tanks leaked into the sea, Johan Marius Ly of the Norwegian Coast Guard said. The fuel was expected to evaporate quickly.\n\nThe 134-meter (442-foot) long frigate, built in Spain in 2009, has a helipad platform on its stern.\n\nStensoenes said the frigate had been pushed by towboats into shallow waters where it could not sink fully. \u201cWe are in a security phase for the time being,\u201d he added. He declined to comment on what would happen to the weapons on board the ship.\n\nThe frigate is part of a NATO fleet in the Atlantic and the alliance has been informed of the accident, he told reporters.\n\nNorway\u2019s largest oil and gas company, Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, said it shut down non-emergency activities at the Sture terminal where the collision occurred \u201cas a precautionary measure.\u201d\n\nThe Accident Investigation Board added that because the tanker is Maltese-registered, the Marine Safety Investigation Unit (MSIU) of Malta will also participate in the investigation.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Many of his assertions are repeats that we have covered extensively in our database of his false or misleading statements, which as of Oct. 30 totaled 6,420. But some of these things may appear new or fresh to readers, so here\u2019s a quick tour of some of them.\n\nThe president also opened with a series of statistics to suggest he actually earned a \u201cbig victory\u201d at the polls, despite Republicans losing control of the House of Representatives. We will start with those.\n\n\u201cFifty-five is the largest number of Republican senators in the last 100 years.\u201d\n\nFalse. Republicans had a 55-seat majority in the Senate from 1997 to 2000 and from 2005 to 2006, according to the Senate Historian\u2019s office. From 1921 to 1927, Republicans held 59, 53 and 54 seats \u2014 when the Senate only had 96 seats. (Alaska and Hawaii were not yet states.) Republicans thus represented more than 55 percent of the body in each of those two-year sessions.\n\n\u201cIn President Obama\u2019s first midterm election, he lost six Senate seats, including in the deep blue state of Massachusetts. Republicans captured at least four Senate seats held by Democrat incumbents. And these are tremendously talented, hard-working people that did this. Indiana, North Dakota, Florida, Missouri.\u201d\n\nTrump may be jumping the gun. Florida is headed to a recount.\n\n\u201cThis election marks the largest Senate gains for a president\u2019s party in a first midterm election since at least President Kennedy\u2019s in 1962. There have been only four midterm elections since 1934 in which a president\u2019s party has gained even a single Senate seat.\u201d\n\nThis is accurate, but the comparison only serves Trump\u2019s purpose if Rick Scott of Florida wins his recount. Otherwise, he would be tied with Bush. The Arizona race is still too close to call, so his number would also decline if the Democrat prevails. (Update, Nov. 13: Democrat Kyrsten Sinema prevailed in Arizona, which makes inoperative all of Trump\u2019s Senate statistics at this news conference.)\n\n1962 Kennedy (D +3)\n\n1970 Nixon (R +1)\n\n2002 Bush (R +2)\n\n\u201cAs an example, of the 11 candidates we campaigned with during the last week, nine won last night.\u201d\n\n13 total, 8 won, 3 lost, Kemp and Scott are still not certain (but ahead). Our colleague Philip Bump calculated that Trump\u2019s endorsement record on Twitter stands at 50-50 \u2014 26 wins, 26 losses, including races where the candidate is either leading or lagging in the count.\n\nSenate\n\nJosh Hawley, Mo. (yes)\n\nMike Braun, Ind. (yes)\n\nJames B. Renacci, Ohio (no)\n\nMarsha Blackburn, Tenn. (yes)\n\nRick Scott, Fla. (maybe)\n\nMatt Rosendale, Mont. (no)\n\nPatrick Morrisey, W.Va. (no)\n\nHouse\n\nJim Jordan, Ohio (yes)\n\nGreg Gianforte, Mont. (yes)\n\nCarol Miller, W.Va. (yes)\n\nGov\n\nMike DeWine, Ohio (yes)\n\nBrian Kemp, Ga. (maybe)\n\nRon DeSantis, Fla. (yes)\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand tax returns. Now, I did do a [financial disclosure] filing of over a hundred pages, I believe, which is in the offices. And when people went and saw that filing and they saw the magnitude of it, they were very disappointed. And they saw the \u2014 you know, the detail. You get far more from that. And I guess we filed that, now, three times. But you get far more from that than you could ever get from a tax return.\u201d\n\nThe president has long refused to release a copy of his income tax return, despite previous promises he would do so. Here, he argues that the financial disclosure form, required by the Federal Election Commission from all candidates for federal office, is superior to the information contained in a tax return.\n\nThat\u2019s false. A tax return provides a lot of information that is not contained in the disclosure form, including: what, if anything, Trump paid in taxes, what kinds of tax deductions and other tax breaks he took, whether he has offshore accounts, and whether he gave to charity. The president\u2019s effective tax rate would be learned and could be easily compared to that of ordinary Americans. Financial disclosure forms require only that assets be reported with broad ranges; a tax return would have the value to the dollar.\n\nFinally, financial disclosure forms are not audited for accuracy and could easily contain inflated claims of wealth. Falsifying a tax return could result in fines or even prison time, thus a tax return is a more believable document.\n\n\u201cNobody turns over a return when it\u2019s under audit. Okay?\u201d\n\nWrong. The first president to make public his tax returns was Richard Nixon \u2014 and he was under audit at the time, according to a summary on taxhistory.org. Nixon released them as news reports raised questions about extensive tax deductions he had taken to greatly reduce his tax liability. Nixon was ultimately required to pay $465,000 in back taxes and fines. The scandal led Nixon\u2019s successor, Gerald Ford, to begin the tradition of a president\u2019s releasing his tax returns.\n\nThe tax investigation came during the Watergate probe, and Nixon\u2019s famous declaration, \u201cI am not a crook,\u201d is often wrongly attributed to a defense of his actions surrounding Watergate.\n\nIn fact, Nixon made the comment while defending his tax deductions. He said he welcomed the scrutiny: \u201cI have never profited, never profited from public service \u2014 I have earned every cent. And in all of my years of public life, I have never obstructed justice,\u201d Nixon told reporters in 1973. \u201cI welcome this kind of examination, because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I am not a crook. I have earned everything I have got.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look at the employment and unemployment numbers for African Americans, for Asian Americans, for Hispanic Americans, they\u2019re at a historic high. A poll came out recently where my numbers with Hispanics and with African Americans are the highest \u2014 the best they\u2019ve ever been. That had \u2014 that took place two or three days ago, the poll. They\u2019re \u2014 I have the best numbers with African American and Hispanic American that I\u2019ve ever had before.\u201d\n\nUnemployment rates \u2014 which Trump in the 2016 campaign derided as phony \u2014 have hit the lowest levels this year since the collection of such data started about three decades ago, though the numbers have ticked up from those lows recently for Asian Americans and African Americans. But that has not translated into greater approval of Trump by those groups.\n\nTrump loves to cite the Rasmussen poll, which already leans heavily toward Republicans. But that\u2019s a cherry-picked result from the poorly-rated outfit that relies heavily on automated dialing. Reputable polls consistently find that Trump has very low support among African Americans. For example, Quinnipiac in August found that 9 percent of black voters approved, compared with 85 percent who disapproved.\n\nGallup\u2019s monthly tracking surveys, which are based on interviews with roughly 1,000 people each, finds Trump at 13 percent approval among black adults; Trump has never been below 8 percent or above 15 percent in their monthly averages.\n\nTrump\u2019s allies, such as Sean Hannity, had touted the Rasmussen data as news that would spell disaster for Democrats in the midterm elections. But national exit polling reported by CNN found black voters supported Democrats over Republicans by 90 percent to 9 percent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had tremendous support, and tremendous support in the Republican Party, among the biggest support in the history of the party. I\u2019ve actually heard at 93 percent, it\u2019s a record, but I won\u2019t say that, because who knows? But we\u2019ve had tremendous support.\u201d\n\nActually, eight times previously, Trump has suggested he has had the highest approval rating of any president among Republicans, even higher than Lincoln. But it still does not make it true. George W. Bush had a high of 99 percent after the Sept. 11 attacks, according to Gallup.\n\n\u201cI had a very, very good meeting \u2014 a very, very good meeting with President Putin and a lot was discussed about security, about Syria, about Ukraine, about the fact that President Obama allowed a very large part of Ukraine to be taken. \u2026 No, it was President Obama that allowed it to happen. Had nothing to do with me.\u201d\n\nPerhaps taking a talking point from Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump once again accuses Barack Obama of allowing Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea while he was president. But Russia seized it, and then Obama responded by rallying other countries to impose sanctions, including kicking Russia out of the annual meeting of the Group of Eight \u2014 the biggest industrialized democracies.\n\nOne can argue whether that response was appropriate, but Obama argued at the time that Ukraine was a core Russian interest but not an American one, so a military confrontation was out of the question. \u201cThe fact is that Ukraine, which is a non-NATO country, is going to be vulnerable to military domination by Russia no matter what we do,\u201d Obama told The Atlantic. He noted that Russia also invaded Georgia under George W. Bush\u2019s watch.\n\n\u201cLet me just tell you, Peter, very simple: because they\u2019re [Democrats] very weak on crime. Because they have often suggested, members and people within the Democratic Party at a high level have suggested getting rid of ICE, getting rid of law enforcement.\u201d\n\nTrump was asked about his harsh attacks on Democrats as the \u201cparty of crime\u201d in his many rallies before the election. But, as for abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, Trump is simply wrong to claim that this idea is on the Democrats' agenda.\n\nA few prominent liberals, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have called for ICE to be abolished. But they are not members of Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer\u2019s leadership team in the Senate. The handful of Democrats in the House who support abolishing ICE are not members of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s leadership team. Many Democrats say ICE should be reformed, not abolished. It was created after the Sept. 11 attacks, in a merging of various investigative arms of other agencies.\n\n\u201cWe made more progress [with North Korea] in that four or five months than they\u2019ve made in 70 years.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump may believe this, but he\u2019s ignoring North Korea\u2019s long history of making agreements and then not living up to its obligations.\n\nThe document signed by Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was remarkably vague, leaving it open to interpretation and debate, compared to previous documents signed by North Korea. The statement said North Korea (officially the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, or DPRK) committed to \u201cwork towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d The phrase is not defined and \u201ctoward\u201d is rather weak. In the past, North Korea viewed \u201cdenuclearization\u201d to mean the United States removing the nuclear umbrella it provides to Japan and South Korea; there is no indication its definition has changed.\n\nMeanwhile, the Washington Post reported in June that U.S. intelligence officials, citing newly obtained evidence, have concluded that North Korea does not intend to fully surrender its nuclear stockpile, and instead is considering ways to conceal the number of weapons it has and secret production facilities. In July, the Post reported Pyongyang is constructing new missiles at a factory that produced the country\u2019s first intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States.\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles\n\nShare the Facts 2018-11-08 11:44:10 UTC Washington Post -1 -1 -1 Washington Post Rating: False Washington Post Rating: \u201cWe made more progress [with North Korea] in that four or five months than they\u2019ve made in 70 years.\u201d Donald Trump President www.whitehouse.gov during a news conference Wednesday, November 7, 2018 2018-11-07 Read More info", "Updated.\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson was at his desk Wednesday evening, less than two hours before his 8 p.m. live show, when he suddenly started receiving multiple text messages.\n\nThere was some sort of commotion happening outside his home in Northwest D.C.\n\n\u201cI called my wife,\u201d Carlson told The Washington Post in a phone interview. \u201cShe had been in the kitchen alone getting ready to go to dinner and she heard pounding on the front door and screaming. ... Someone started throwing himself against the front door and actually cracked the front door.\u201d\n\nHis wife, thinking it was a home invasion, locked herself in the pantry and called 911, Carlson said. The couple have four children, but none were home at the time.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t a home invasion. It was a protest.\n\nAccording to now-deleted social media posts shared by Smash Racism D.C., a local anti-fascist organization whose members have been tied to other demonstrations against prominent Republican figures, activists showed up outside Carlson\u2019s home Wednesday and they had a message for him.\n\n\u201cTucker Carlson, we are outside your home,\u201d one person could be heard saying in the since-deleted video. The person, using a bullhorn, accused Carlson of \u201cpromoting hate\u201d and \u201can ideology that has led to thousands of people dying.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want you to know, we know where you sleep at night,\u201d the person concluded, before leading the group to chant, \u201cTucker Carlson, we will fight! We know where you sleep at night!\u201d\n\nRoughly 20 people had gathered outside Carlson\u2019s residence, said Lt. Jon Pongratz of the D.C. police. Authorities received a call at about 6:30 p.m. Wednesday and responded \u201cwithin a few minutes,\u201d Pongratz told The Post.\n\nCarlson said the protesters had blocked off both ends of his street and carried signs that listed his home address. The group called Carlson a \u201cracist scumbag\" and demanded that he \u201cleave town,\u201d according to posts on Twitter. A woman was also overheard in one of the deleted videos saying she wanted to \u201cbring a pipe bomb\u201d to his house, he said.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a protest. It was a threat,\u201d said Carlson, who is often denounced by critics, particularly liberal ones, for his rhetoric about immigrants and minorities on his Fox News show. \u201cThey weren\u2019t protesting anything specific that I had said. They weren\u2019t asking me to change anything. They weren\u2019t protesting a policy or advocating for legislation. ... They were threatening me and my family and telling me to leave my own neighborhood in the city that I grew up in.\u201d\n\nHe added that he still does not know who was behind the protest, but plans to find out.\n\nOn Twitter, Smash Racism D.C. accused Carlson of spreading \u201cfear into our homes\u201d every night, taking particular issue with his comments about the migrant caravan.\n\n\u201cTonight you\u2019re reminded that we have a voice,\u201d a now-deleted tweet read. \u201cTonight, we remind you that you are not safe either.\u201d\n\nThe host\u2019s address, as well as the addresses of his brother and good friend Neil Patel, with whom he co-founded the conservative media site the Daily Caller, were shared in tweets from Smash Racism DC\u2019s account.\n\nIn a Facebook post that included video of the gathering, the group wrote, \u201cFascists are vulnerable. Confront them at their homes!\u201d\n\n\u201cProtecting ourselves and our communities means interfering with those who make a platform for hate,\u201d the statement said. \u201cSo we will go to their homes and their workplaces, and find them in restaurants.\u201d\n\nFollowing backlash and news reports, Twitter removed the problematic tweets and suspended the group\u2019s account early Thursday morning. The Facebook video was also taken down, but the page is still up. In a Facebook message Thursday morning, the group told The Post that they did not have any comment beyond the statement shared with the deleted video.\n\nHours after the protesters dispersed, police were still stationed near Carlson\u2019s home, Pongratz said, adding the block will be under \u201cspecial attention\u201d for \u201cas long as needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep an eye on the block and the area because of the earlier disturbance to make sure that nothing escalates,\u201d he said, noting that the increased security was a decision made by police. \u201cWe wanted to make sure that it stayed safe ... in case they do come back.\u201d\n\nNews of the protest and doxing, revealing personal information on the Internet, prompted widespread condemnation from not just conservative-leaning journalists or Fox News personalities but also media members who are critical of Carlson.\n\nIn a joint statement emailed to The Post, Fox News\u2019s CEO Suzanne Scott and president Jay Wallace said what happened outside Carlson\u2019s home was \u201creprehensible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe violent threats and intimidation tactics toward him and his family are completely unacceptable,\u201d the statement said, adding that the country has \u201cbecome far too intolerant of different points of view\u201d and recent events \u201cclearly highlight the need for a more civil, respectful, and inclusive national conversation.\u201d\n\nMegyn Kelly, the former Fox News personality who is reportedly in exit talks with NBC, called the demonstration \u201cstomach-turning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has to stop,\u201d Kelly tweeted, sharing a video of the protesters. \u201cWho are we?

He added that he loves his home and neighborhood and does not want to move.\n\n\u201cThey think of Northwest D.C. as a tranquil sanctuary where they know everyone and everyone is nice,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think of this as the greatest place in the world.\u201d\n\nNow, Carlson is worried about leaving his family alone at home.\n\n\u201cHow can you go out for dinner and leave the kids at home at this point?\" he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re talking about pipe bombs ... how do you live like that?\u201d\n\nHe added that he also doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do about checking the mail.

(Andy Lyons/Getty Images)\n\nGiven that videos of Zion Williamson\u2019s thundering, athletic dunks were going viral well before he left high school, plenty of hoops fans were aware that he possessed enormous physical gifts. In Duke\u2019s season-opening destruction Tuesday of Kentucky, however, the 6-foot-7, 285-pound freshman also displayed an impressive skill set, one that had a prominent NBA coach paying him the highest of compliments.\n\nAs the Warriors\u2019 Steve Kerr quickly realized, the NBA frowns on team officials such as himself discussing in such a manner players not on his own squad. However, he had already let it be known that when he saw Williamson belie his large frame by handling the ball, hitting shots from outside and making nifty passes, only one thing came to mind: LeBron James.\n\nAsked Wednesday if he had taken note of something related to Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo, the freakishly gifted star player for Golden State\u2019s upcoming opponent, Kerr replied, \u201cNo, but I saw some kid on Duke last night who is pretty impressive. My goodness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI probably can\u2019t say anything more, or mention his name,\u201d the coach continued, before acknowledging that Duke had \u201clots\u201d of impressive young players. \u201cThe one who\u2019s 285,\u201d he specified.\n\n\u201cI thought LeBron, I thought that was a one-shot deal, but apparently the next guy\u2019s coming,\u201d Kerr said. To laughs from the assembled reporters at Golden State\u2019s practice facility, he added, \u201cBefore I get fined, I\u2019m going to change the subject.\u201d\n\nSteve Kerr amazed by Zion Williamson last night: \u201cLeBron, I thought that was a one shot deal...\u201d and then realizes he can\u2019t say anything: \u201cAdam, wherever you are, please don\u2019t fine me.\u201d pic.twitter.com/dkmrOG1JcJ \u2014 Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) November 7, 2018\n\nWhile Duke\u2019s R.J. Barrett, a freshman phenom in his own right, actually led his team with 33 points against the Wildcats and is a candidate to go No. 1 overall in next year\u2019s NBA draft, Williamson has quickly emerged as the Blue Devils\u2019 most compelling player. He was far more efficient than Barrett in Duke\u2019s 118-84 triumph over Kentucky, making 11 of 13 shots for 28 points to his teammate\u2019s 13-of-26 shooting performance, and he accomplished the more difficult task in more than living up to an extraordinary amount of hype.\n\nAs with the countless number of athletic, scoring wings on the college basketball scene two decades ago who were hopelessly miscast as \u201cthe next Michael Jordan,\u201d the comparisons to James could look very foolish, very quickly for Williamson. But in the short term, it\u2019s not hard to understand why Kerr and others would offer them.\n\nOf course, they\u2019re not exactly the same type of athlete, with Williamson making James, listed at 6-8 and 250, look positively sleek. A bit shorter and at a weight that would make him the second-heaviest player in the NBA this season \u2014 only the Clippers' 7-3 center, Boban Marjanovic, tips the scales at a higher number, and even then, not by much at 290 \u2014 Williamson\u2019s most apt comparison might be Charles Barkley, a similarly undersized, stout forward who could bulldoze past defenders or sky over them.\n\nIn the wake of Duke\u2019s win over Kentucky, a former Blue Devil who\u2019s now an ESPN analyst, Jay Williams, invoked that name but mixed in another former NBA star who was renowned for his rim-rocking prowess. \u201cI would go with the Charles Barkley-like frame, that aggression he plays with,\u201d Williams said Wednesday of Williamson, \u201cwith Dominique Wilkins\u2019s hops. That\u2019s a scary combination.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, James\u2019s size and passing skills had him likened in high school to Magic Johnson, and Williamson isn\u2019t nearly as gifted as a distributor (in fairness, almost no one has been). However, what Kerr likely was getting at was just a sense, in watching both players, that they possess almost unfair attributes compared to their contemporaries.\n\n28 pts on 11/13 FG\n\n\n\nWe can talk about Zion all we want, but let's take a minute to just watch. pic.twitter.com/ToJMKKAbHd \u2014 ESPN (@espn) November 7, 2018\n\nIn reality, it\u2019s already apparent that Williamson, however his basketball career ultimately turns out, is in his own, unique category, just as LeBron isn\u2019t Magic and certainly isn\u2019t Jordan. For now, though, he may be the closest thing we\u2019ll see to an answer to the oft-asked question, \u201cIf LeBron had to spend a year in college before joining the NBA \u2014 man, what would that have looked like?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Kerr has other things to worry about, such as hearing from the NBA about his perhaps overly exuberant comments Wednesday. Sensing that he had at least approached a no-fly zone, Kerr referred to Commissioner Adam Silver in pleading with a smile, \u201cAdam, please don\u2019t fine me, wherever you are.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nLaMelo Ball is returning to high school basketball, and it\u2019s already absurd\n\nESPN\u2019s Stephen A.

This raises concerns the Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, plan to use the patients at the Hodeida hospital as human shields to ward off airstrikes from the coalition. Amnesty is urging the warring sides to protect civilians. (Hani Mohammed, File/Associated Press)\n\nCAIRO \u2014 Aid groups warned of the plight of civilians in Yemen\u2019s contested Hodeida where casualties are mounting as a Saudi-led coalition is fighting to take the port city from the country\u2019s Shiite rebels.\n\nSeparate from the warning, a collection of aid groups, including CARE and 34 others, issued a statement on Thursday, calling for an immediate cease-fire in Yemen.\n\nAmnesty International warned late Wednesday that rebels have taken up positions on a Hodeida hospital rooftop, raising concerns they are using the hospital\u2019s patients as human shields to ward off coalition airstrikes. Doctors Without Borders, meanwhile, said it was treating two dozen wounded from the latest offensive.\n\nThe push against the Iran-backed rebels also known as Houthis who are holding Hodeida began anew this month, shortly after the United States called for a cease-fire by the end of the month.\n\nApparently in a rush to try to take Hodeida before then, coalition artillery, helicopter gunships and airstrikes have pounded the rebels, with dozens killed on both sides. The rebels admit they are outnumbered but have vowed to fight on.\n\nCease-fires in Yemen\u2019s civil war have rarely held, and peace talks have repeatedly broken down in the past.\n\nAmnesty urged the warring sides to protect civilians. It said that the coalition, which relies heavily on air power, has killed scores of civilians in recent airstrikes, and rebels are responding with mortars in residential neighborhoods that cause indiscriminate casualties.\n\n\u201cThe presence of Houthi fighters on the hospital\u2019s roof violates international humanitarian law,\u201d said Amnesty\u2019s Samah Hadid, adding that \u201cthis violation does not make the hospital and the patients and medical staff lawful targets\u201d for the coalition.\n\nHadid said the hospital was full of wounded \u201ccivilians who have nowhere else to go for lifesaving medical care. Anyone attacking a hospital under these conditions risks responsibility for war crimes.\u201d\n\nThe conflict in Yemen, the Arab world\u2019s poorest country, began with the 2014 takeover of the capital, Sanaa, by the Houthis who toppled the internationally recognized government. The Saudi-led coalition has been fighting the rebels since 2015, in an attempt to restore that government to power.\n\nIn recent days, fighting intensified with troops trained by the United Arab Emirates, a coalition member, advanced in eastern Hodeida, pushing toward the city\u2019s port and key Red Sea facilities, some 5 kilometers (3 miles) away.\n\nIn their statement, CARE and 34 other groups urged the international community to \u201csecure an immediate cessation of hostilities\u201d and \u201csuspend the supply of arms at risk of being used in Yemen.\u201d The United States sells most of the weapons used by the coalition, while the rebels largely use local stocks. The Houthis have also been accused of firing Iran-made missiles into Saudi Arabia and at coalition ships.\n\nDoctors Without Borders reported an influx of wounded civilians in recent days, with 24 wounded, including women and children from Hodeida, with mostly blast and gunshot injuries.\n\nThe aid group, known under its French acronym MSF, said civilians were reported leaving Hodeida over the weekend but that it was difficult to assess how many remained trapped inside.\n\nThe Saudi-backed Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi appointed a new defense minister to fill a role that had been empty for several years, naming Mohammed al-Maqdishi for the post, according to the state SABA news agency late Wednesday.

A Christian woman acquitted after eight years on death row in Pakistan for blasphemy was released but her whereabouts in Islamabad on Thursday remained a closely guarded secret in the wake of demands by radical Islamists that she be publicly executed. (Fareed Khan/Associated Press)\n\nISLAMABAD \u2014 A week after Pakistan\u2019s Supreme Court acquitted her of blasphemy, a Christian woman who had been on death row for eight years was freed from detention Thursday, but her whereabouts are a closely guarded secret following demands by extremists that she be hanged in public.\n\nThe case of Aasia Bibi has become a political minefield for Prime Minister Imran Khan. He is trying to placate the Muslim extremists who have threatened to topple his government, while keeping the 54-year-old mother of five safe from a lynch mob and also finding a way to allow her to leave Pakistan without bringing rioters into the streets.\n\nBibi has been offered asylum by the European Parliament, which championed her case after she was convicted in 2010 under Pakistan\u2019s harsh blasphemy law. There has been sharp worldwide criticism of the law, which remains popular in the Muslim majority country and carries the death penalty for insulting Islam but also has been used as a way to settle scores and pressure minorities.\n\nBibi was with her family under heavy security after being transferred to the Pakistani capital overnight from her detention facility in southern Punjab, triggering expectations of an imminent departure from the country.\n\nFor the moment, Bibi remained in Pakistan, according to two people close to her who spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to endanger her. That was confirmed later Thursday by Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry.\n\nFollowing her Oct. 31 acquittal by Pakistan\u2019s Supreme Court, the hard-line Tehreek-e-Labbaik Party forced a nationwide shutdown as its supporters filled the streets for three days to protest the ruling. The rallies only dispersed after Khan\u2019s government promised that a court would review a motion to challenge the acquittal and deny Bibi permission to leave Pakistan.\n\nKhan, who came to power after elections last summer in part on an Islamist agenda, was immediately accused by critics of giving in to the extremists.\n\nBibi\u2019s release, high-security transfer to Islamabad and her likely departure raised the possibility that Khan\u2019s promises to the Islamists could have been an effort to buy time. The government, however, has not openly declared that Bibi was free to leave.\n\nTehreek-e-Labbaik, in a video message that was circulated widely Thursday, said it received government assurances following Bibi\u2019s relocation to Islamabad that she wouldn\u2019t leave the country until the review petition was heard.\n\nKhan, a former cricket star and playboy who has embraced religious conservatism before he ran for prime minister, is hamstrung by contradictions within his own government, according to Zahid Hussain, who has written two books on the rise of militancy in Pakistan.\n\n\u201cThere are some within the party, senior members of the party, who are pampering religious extremists for the sake of votes, and some believe in the same kind of world view,\u201d Hussain said in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nBibi\u2019s ordeal began on a blistering hot day in 2009 when she went to fetch water for herself and fellow farmworkers. An argument took place after two women refused to drink from the same container as Bibi, who is Roman Catholic.\n\nThe two women later said Bibi had insulted the Prophet Muhammad, and she was charged with blasphemy. She was put on trial, convicted and sentenced to death in 2010.\n\nWhile her conviction was appealed, her case gained worldwide attention and focused international criticism on the blasphemy law. In announcing her acquittal last week, a three-judge panel of the Supreme Court upheld the law itself but said prosecutors had failed to prove Bibi had violated it.\n\nEuropean Parliament President Antonio Tajani invited Bibi and her family to Europe. In a letter, a copy of which was seen by the AP, Tajani told Bibi\u2019s husband Ashiq Masih that the parliament is \u201cextremely concerned for your safety as well as your family\u2019s, due to the violence by extremist elements in Pakistan.\u201d\n\nThe letter added to expectations that she and her family would leave for Europe, though their destination has not been confirmed. Spain and France have offered her asylum.\n\nSpeaking to the AP earlier this week in the Punjab capital of Lahore, Masih said he hasn\u2019t slept much since his wife\u2019s acquittal and the subsequent outrage by extremists. His initial joy quickly turned to sadness when he realized the ordeal was not over.\n\nHe said that he is consumed by fear every time his phone rings and haunted by the shouts of \u201cHang her!\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I pace on the rooftop, sometimes I walk on the road outside our home,\u201d he said. \u201cI look at the faces around me and I wonder if anyone is waiting to hurt us.\u201d\n\nEven the mere suggestion of blasphemy can whip mobs into a lynching frenzy in Pakistan. In 2011, the governor of Punjab province was killed by his own guard after he defended Bibi and criticized the blasphemy law. A year later, Shahbaz Bhatti, the minister for minorities and a Christian, was shot and killed.\n\nFor Bibi\u2019s husband, leaving Pakistan is painful but remains a matter of life and death.\n\n\u201cWe have no other choice but to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cI love Pakistan but I can\u2019t live here.\u201d\n\nEven in Bibi\u2019s home village of Aitta Wali \u2014 an impoverished farming community where animals and residents share tiny, sunbaked mud houses \u2014 there is still outrage over her acquittal, and its remaining three Christian families have fled.\n\n\u201cOur entire village swore on the Quran that she insulted the prophet but no one believes us and everyone believes her,\u201d said Aman Ali, one of the villagers. \u201cBefore this, we liked the Christian families. We always got along. But now there is only anger.\u201d\n\nSome of that anger was directed at a visiting AP reporter, who was told by one resident: \u201cGo. Just get out. Go.\u201d\n\nMuhammad Afzal Qadri, a leader in the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Party and a religious scholar, said he doesn\u2019t regret calling for the deaths of the three judges who acquitted Bibi, or for calling on his followers to overthrow Khan\u2019s government.\n\nAt his sprawling madrassa in the Punjab city of Gujrat, Qadri told the AP this week that he had the religious authority to declare a fatwa, or edict, demanding the judges be killed.\n\nPakistan is bound by Islamic injunctions, he said, adding that he was qualified to decide such matters. The West only seeks to undermine Pakistan\u2019s Islamic traditions and culture, Qadri said.\n\nHussain, the author on Pakistani militancy, said the demonstrations over Bibi\u2019s acquittal were an attempt to regain positions the extremists had lost in the July elections.\n\nAnother rally Thursday in the southern city of Karachi drew thousands. One religious leader, Fazlur Rehman, whose party was routed in the elections, said the \u201ccourt of the masses\u201d has rejected Bibi\u2019s acquittal.\n\nThe Tehreek-e-Taliban insurgent group warned anyone who would commit blasphemy that \u201cour daggers will cut your throat.\u201d\n\nHussain said the extremists \u201care trying to mobilize people on this issue, creating more extremism. They have created a sense of fear in society, for anyone who disagrees with their view of Islam.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Munir Ahmed in Islamabad, Asim Tanvir in Multan, Pakistan, Mohammad Farooq in Karachi, Pakistan, and Ishtiaq Mahsud, in Dera Ismail Khan, Pakistan, contributed.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

King has a long record of demonizing minorities, fulminating over the decline of white \u201ccivilization\u201d and courting extremists who peddle racist conspiracy theories about the \u201creplacement\u201d of white Europeans by nonwhite immigrants.\n\nKing also sparked ire after meeting members of the far-right Austrian Freedom Party, which was founded by a former SS officer and has since struggled to shed links to its neo-fascist past. He defended fraternizing with them with a matter-of-fact observation: \u201cIf they were in America pushing the platform that they push, they would be Republicans,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are many Republicans who would bristle at King\u2019s contention, but they are a waning force. President Trump has been the catalyst of a dramatic realignment \u2014 or \u201ca repolarization of politics,\u201d as my colleagues Michael Scherer and Josh Dawsey put it \u2014 that branded the GOP as the faction of white nationalist rage.\n\n#Salvini: #Trump sconfitto alle elezioni di #midterm?

Averne battute di arresto come lui... #ottoemezzo \u2014 Matteo Salvini (@matteosalvinimi) November 7, 2018\n\nThe reaction to the midterms in Europe reflected the continent\u2019s own divisions. Frans Timmermans, the European Commission\u2019s first vice president, saw the Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives as encouragement for Europe\u2019s own liberal establishment, which is preparing for a far-right assault in next year\u2019s elections for the European Union Parliament.\n\n\u201cInspired by voters in the U.S. who chose hope over fear, civility over rudeness, inclusion over racism, equality over discrimination,\u201d Timmermans wrote in a Twitter post. \u201cThey stood up for their values. And so will we.\u201d\n\nBut Italian far-right leader Matteo Salvini hailed the Senate gains made by Republicans, who picked off a number of vulnerable Democrats in Trump-friendly states.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to President Trump for the seats he won at the Senate and those he held in crucial states against everyone: left-wing journalists, actors, singers, directors and pseudo-intellectuals,\u201d said Salvini, nursing the grievance and resentment that fuels far-right politics on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nTrump pushed the same fearful message about immigration that has defined his agenda since he ran for president. He shirked the counsel of Hill insiders and establishment Republican politicians, including outgoing Speaker of the House Paul D. Ryan (Wis.), that he focus on the strong economy and other positive stories.\n\n\"The president became upset when his campaign produced an ad that focused on economic gains through the eyes of a mother hoping her daughter would succeed, surprising his own political advisers,\u201d reported The Washington Post\u2019s Scherer and Dawsey.\n\n\u201cTrump,\u201d they wrote, \u201cwanted to talk immigration.\u201d He conjured a fictional migrant \u201cinvasion\u201d out of reports that a bedraggled caravan of asylum seekers was slowly making its way toward the United States. He ostentatiously deployed active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and attacked Democrats and immigrants with a TV ad so nakedly racist that even Fox News pulled it from the airwaves.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump showed no contrition for the toxic effect of his rhetoric, which critics say fueled a spate of recent right-wing terrorist attacks. Indeed, he took credit for Republican victories and mocked Republicans who lost their elections because they refused his \u201cembrace.\u201d White House aides also cheered Trump\u2019s ability to mobilize votes in largely white areas, which helped fuel the gains in the Senate and high-profile wins in the Ohio and Florida governor\u2019s races.\n\nThose that worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election, embracing certain policies and principles, did very well. Those that did not, say goodbye! Yesterday was such a very Big Win, and all under the pressure of a Nasty and Hostile Media! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2018\n\n\u201cIt speaks badly of our country that such unscrupulous tactics paid off in so many races,\u201d wrote Post columnist Max Boot. \u201cThe fact that the GOP went there confirms its transformation from a Reagan-Ryan conservative party into a white-nationalist party in Trump\u2019s image. If you think the immigrant-bashing was offensive this year, imagine what it will be like in two years when Trump himself is on the ballot.\u201d\n\nFor Trump, as for Europe\u2019s far right, the game is polarization: A galvanized minority of voters is preferable to an apathetic majority. But unlike in Europe, where parliamentary politics usually keep the far right out of government, the nature of the U.S. political system means that a far-right GOP can still wield huge amounts of power. And with Trump having staved off the worst of the Democratic wave in 2018 using racial animus, there are justifiable fears that the president and his allies will turn even more extreme in 2020.\n\nSo we may hear more of the racist robo-calls that Florida voters received mocking Andrew Gillum, the black Democratic candidate for governor. There may be more candidates like Trump-endorsed Ron DeSantis, Gillum\u2019s victorious opponent, who warned voters not to \u201cmonkey this up\u201d by voting for Gillum. There could be another wave of anti-Semitic campaign ads featuring Jewish candidates clutching bunches of cash. And there will certainly be more attempts to tighten voting laws in ways that hurt minority groups more than anyone else.\n\nThe people mobilizing against such divisive politics hope that revulsion to racism will yield its own electoral dividend. \u201cWe know that racism divides people, but we have also seen that racial justice also unites and motivates people,\u201d Rashad Robinson, the president of the racial justice group Color of Change, told The Post. \u201cThis is not a matter of Trump\u2019s frame being the more compelling one. It\u2019s about his platform being the larger one.\u201d\n\nBut that presidential platform does matter. Trump has taken the culture-war tactics of Europe\u2019s far right into the American mainstream, something Republican leaders in recent decades might only furtively have attempted. And Trump may be no aberration.\n\n\u201cThe harsh truth is this: Racism often works. Cross-racial coalitions for economic justice are the exception in American history. Mobilizing white people to protect their racial dominance is the norm,\u201d wrote the Atlantic\u2019s Peter Beinart. \u201cThe lesson of 2018 is that American politics is not reverting to \u2018normal.\u2019 In many ways, Trumpism is normal. It\u2019s not Trump who is running uphill against American tradition, it\u2019s the people who try \u2014 bravely but with mixed success \u2014 to stop him.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

Humanitarian aid converged around the stadium in Mexico City where thousands of Central American migrants winding their way toward the United States were resting Tuesday after an arduous trek that has taken them through three countries in three weeks. (Rodrigo Abd/Associated Press)\n\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 Central American migrants in a caravan that has stopped in Mexico City demanded buses Thursday to take them to the U.S. border, saying it is too cold and dangerous to continue walking and hitchhiking.\n\nMexico City authorities say that of the 4,841 registered migrants receiving shelter in a sports complex, 1,726 are under the age of 18, including 310 children under five.\n\n\u201cWe need buses to continue travelling,\u201d said Milton Benitez, a caravan coordinator. Benitez noted that It would be colder in northern Mexico and it wasn\u2019t safe for the migrants to continue along highways, where drug cartels frequently operate.\n\nHe said the route and departure time would be decided at a meeting Thursday night.\n\nThe Mexican government has said most of the migrants have refused offers to stay in Mexico, and only a small number have agreed to return to their home countries. About 85 percent of the migrants are from Honduras, while others are from the Central American countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is the longest route but is the best border, while Texas is the closest but the worst\u201d border, said Jose Luis Fuentes of the National Lawyers Guild to gathered migrants.\n\nThere have already been reports of migrants on the caravan going missing, though that is often because they hitch rides on trucks that turn off on different routes, leaving them lost.\n\nHowever, the U.N. human rights agency said its office in Mexico had filed a report with prosecutors in the central state of Puebla about two buses that migrants boarded in the last leg of the trip to Mexico City early this week, and whose whereabouts are not known.\n\nMexico City is itself more than 600 miles from the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas, and a previous caravan in the spring opted for a much longer route to Tijuana in the far northwest, across from San Diego. That caravan steadily dwindled to only about 200 people by the time it reached the border.\n\nFuentes warned the migrants that if they are separated from their children they should \u201csay they want a lawyer and not sign any paper.\u201d\n\nOther activists and officials explained the options available to migrants in Mexico, which has offered them refuge, asylum or work visas. The government said 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them while they wait for the 45-day application process for a more permanent status.\n\nWednesday\u2019s assembly came a day after U.S. midterm elections in which President Donald Trump had converted the migrants into a campaign issue, portraying them as a major threat.\n\nMarlon Ivan Mendez, a farm worker from Copan, Honduras, was waiting in line for donated shoes to replace the worn crocs he has used since leaving his country three weeks ago. He said he left because gangs were charging him rent to live in his own home.\n\n\u201cIt is not fair that the good ones pay for the sinners,\u201d Mendez said of fears that gang members are coming with the caravan.\n\nChristopher Gascon, the Mexico representative for the International Organization for Migration, estimated there are perhaps another 4,000 in caravans that are working their way through southern Mexico.\n\nBut some migrants had been visiting the organization\u2019s tent asking about how they can return home.\n\nOn Wednesday night, a bus left from Mexico City to return 37 people to their countries of origin.\n\nNora Torres, clutching a Styrofoam cup of tea, was rethinking everything. A day earlier she had been committed to at least reaching a Mexican border city where she heard there were good-paying jobs. But Thursday she said she was thinking of returning to her hometown of Puerto Cortes, Honduras.\n\n\u201cSpending so much time in one place makes me desperate,\u201d said Torres.\n\nIn the stadium, hundreds of Mexico City employees and even more volunteers helped sort donations and direct migrants toward food, water, diapers and other basics. Migrants searched through piles of clothes and grabbed boxes of milk for children.\n\nDarwin Pereira, a 23-year-old construction worker from Olanchito, Honduras, left his country with his wife and son, 4, for the very simple reason that \u201cthere is no work there.\u201d\n\nPereira, who still wears the same cheap plastic sandals he left Honduras with a month ago, thought about what he would do if he met the U.S. president.\n\n\u201cIf I meet Donald Trump, I am going to cry.

Toxic smog shrouds the Indian capital as air quality falls to hazardous levels with tens of thousands of people setting off massive firecrackers to celebrate the major Hindu festival of Diwali on Wednesday night. (Manish Swarup/Associated Press)\n\nNEW DELHI \u2014 Toxic smog shrouded the Indian capital as air quality plummeted to hazardous levels Thursday after tens of thousands of people set off a multitude of firecrackers to celebrate the major Hindu festival of Diwali.\n\nWith schools closed for holidays, many young children stayed indoors to escape the pollution levels in New Delhi that shot up to 681, as reported by the U.S. Embassy Thursday morning from 200 a day earlier. That measurement of small particulate matter in the air is 20 times higher than what\u2019s considered safe by the World Health Organization and could seriously aggravate heart or lung diseases.\n\nThe government blamed the toxic stew on a combination of burning of stubble in agricultural fields and firecrackers. The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology said an increasing surface wind speed is expected to disperse pollutants in two to three days.\n\nMany revelers flouted the Supreme Court order that firecrackers could be exploded only between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. Wednesday. It also said that only less polluting firecrackers could be made and sold.\n\nRias Ahmed, an auto rickshaw driver, said it was highly unlikely that air pollution was going to decrease in and around the Indian capital.\n\n\u201cI have been driving an auto rickshaw since 1994, for 24 or 25 years, and it has been very difficult due to the high pollution. Sometimes when we clean our nose, it\u2019s all black. When we spit or cough, that\u2019s all black. This is a problem.\u201d\n\nMohammad Shahid Raza, a young student, said people let off firecrackers until 1 a.m. Thursday in a south Delhi neighborhood where he lived. \u201cIt was very noisy, and on top of that the pollution level was so high, that when I went outside my house to buy some water, I could see dark clouds, and everything was completely dark. This is not good.\u201d\n\nAuthorities this week tried to reduce dust by sprinkling water in many neighborhoods and ordering builders to cover construction sites. Coal-based power stations in the Indian capital region have been shut down.\n\nThe transport department was checking buses entering the region for valid emission papers and threatening to punish violators. The government has banned diesel vehicles that are more than 10 years old. On Wednesday, it banned the entry of diesel-run trucks into New Delhi from Nov. 8-10 to control the pollution levels. Only those bringing food supplies and vegetables are being allowed.\n\nCrop burning peaks in early November as farmers prepare their fields for sowing winter crops, mainly wheat. They have been ignoring government warnings of a penalty, saying they can\u2019t afford to buy harvesting machines.\n\nThe Central Pollution Control Board is considering cloud seeding to induce artificial rain to the air wasn\u2019t clearer by next week, the Press Trust of India reported.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Ariana Cubillos/Associated Press)\n\nMARACAY, Venezuela \u2014 Rafael Toro, a student at Venezuela\u2019s top veterinary school, suspected something was amiss when a beloved horse called Miss Congeniality didn\u2019t greet him at the fence one recent morning along with others in the campus\u2019 small herd.\n\nThe bright-eyed, bay-colored mare had earned her nickname for helping disabled students overcome their fear of riding horses. They say she was smart and even trotted up when you called her name.\n\nTo his shock, Toro discovered the horse\u2019s skin and dismembered bones hidden among trees in the corner pasture of the sprawling campus in the central Venezuelan city of Maracay. Thieves overnight had hopped the fence, slaughtered the horse and made off with her meat \u2014 either to sell or to feed their hungry families.\n\n\u201cI burst into tears,\u201d said Toro, who delivered the grim news to other students. \u201cWe came here, and together we all cried.\u201d\n\nThe slaughter isn\u2019t an isolated incident. Across Venezuela, as the once-wealthy oil nation\u2019s economy collapses and sky-high inflation leaves residents struggling to afford scarce food, crimes of hunger and desperation are soaring.\n\nRanchers across the country complain their livestock herds are meeting the same fate. There are media reports of small groups of men caught smuggling stolen horse meat \u2014 accompanied by gory pictures of dismembered horses.\n\nProfessors on campus at Central University of Venezuela in Maracay complain that thieves have walked off with air conditioners and electrical wires, forcing them to teach in dark classrooms with sweat running down their backs.\n\nBut in a new low, bandits have turned their attention to slaughtering horses and cattle vital to training the South American nation\u2019s next generation of veterinarians.\n\nThe meat from a full-grown horse could fetch roughly $1,400 at market, based on the equivalent prices of Venezuelan beef, making it a lucrative venture in a country where a worker\u2019s monthly minimum wage is under $10 at the widely-used black market rate.\n\nMonths before Miss Congeniality\u2019s demise, crooks slaughtered two horses donated to the university and that were temporarily quarantined at a nearby pasture, Toro said. Since late 2016, seven cows \u2014 including a prized bull at the center of the school\u2019s breeding program \u2014 have fallen prey to overnight bandits sneaking onto campus.\n\n\u201cA loss like that is pretty expensive,\u201d said professor Daniel Vargas, who oversees the university\u2019s cattle program.\n\nVenezuelans have traditionally been repulsed by the thought of eating horse meat, making recent developments here especially puzzling, say professors, who suspect customers are buying horse meat at their local butcher thinking it is beef.\n\nThe faculty reports each case, but police have yet to arrest any suspects. The school\u2019s budget has been frozen for over a decade, leading security guards to walk off the job and leave the campus an open target, university officials said.\n\n\u201cIt could be an inside job, or someone from outside,\u201d said Isis Vivas, dean of the veterinary school. \u201cAnything is possible.\u201d\n\nToro, a lifelong animal lover who plans to graduate next year, believes Miss Congeniality was singled out from the small heard of five horses. She was four years old, plump and in the prime of life.\n\nAmid the tragic loss, he safeguards her skull so future generations of students can continue to learn from her, such as gauging a horse\u2019s age by examining the teeth.\n\n\u201cWe would have liked for her to stick around here with us and leave us her offspring,\u201d Toro said. \u201cSadly, this is not the case.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Scott Smith on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ScottSmithAP\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The station is an important place to collect data samples partly due to its own location on the remnants of a glacier. (Juan Karita/Associated Press)\n\nLA PAZ, Bolivia \u2014 The snow appears to be pristine on the Andean peaks that loom above Bolivia\u2019s capital, but even here ash and smog reach up to a remote plateau that is home to the world\u2019s highest atmospheric observatory.\n\nIt\u2019s an ideal site for a team of international scientists who collect data on pollution that has contributed to the rapid disappearance of Andean glaciers.\n\nResearch at the Chacaltaya station, which is located at 17,192 feet (5,240 meters) above sea level, has a pressing urgency: The retreat of glaciers, which is compounded by global warming, threatens the main source of fresh water for residents in the nearby cities of EL Alto and La Paz \u2014 and the crops on which they rely.\n\n\u201cIf temperatures continue to rise, these high-altitude glaciers will also lose their mass of ice and there will only be snow on the summit,\u201d said glaciologist Patrick Ginot. \u201cThis will happen all along the Andes.\u201d\n\nLast year, Ginot was part of a team of scientists that transported chunks of ice from a melting Bolivian glacier to Antarctica to be preserved for posterity and future study as part of a global project called \u201cIce Memory.\u201d\n\nThe Chacaltaya station is an important place to collect data samples partly due to its own location on the remnants of a glacier. The glacier, which is thought to be about 18,000 years old, once served as the site of Bolivia\u2019s only ski resort before it melted a decade ago.\n\nInitially, the station was launched as a cosmic ray observatory in the mid-1940s, when just hauling up heavy scientific instruments on the back of llamas was a feat in itself. But Chacaltaya\u2019s altitude and location near the Amazon region \u2014 and its proximity to Bolivia\u2019s capital city \u2014 eventually led scientists to obtain information about the pollution released from the burning of forests, coal, oil and gas.\n\nIn 2012, the site became an atmospheric station used to measure greenhouse gases, reactive gases and particles that can spread all the way to the Pacific Ocean hundreds of miles away. Its altitude is only rivaled by a station recently built by China on the Quinhai-Tibet plateau near Mt. Everest which sits at 17,060 feet (5,200 meters).\n\nChacaltaya, which means \u2018Cold Road\u2019 in Aymara, is jointly funded and managed by groups from the United States and Europe, and the initiative is led by Universidad Mayor de San Andres in La Paz.\n\nJames Butler, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s global monitoring division, said the samples taken and observations made \u201care not influenced by local emissions or similar influences.\u201d\n\n\u201cUpward looking observations from a mountaintop also provide a much better picture of changes in the stratosphere than do observations from lower elevations, because interference in the signal is greatly reduced,\u201d he said.\n\nFernando Velarde, a physicist who works at the observatory, said the data is shared with the international community.\n\n\u201cAs scientists we take a problem, study its effects and try to give answers to society,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the final decisions are in the hands of governments and politicians.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

My husband is not close to his parents. There has been no abuse or fight over a major issue. My husband and I are just really different from his parents. We live in an urban area, they live in a rural area; we have white-collar jobs, they have blue-collar jobs; we're liberal, they're conservative, etc.\n\nSo far, my husband is willing to accommodate his family visiting for only one weekend a year if they stay in a hotel. We do not visit them. Each visit causes my husband a fair amount of anxiety, so I have not pushed for more time. His parents are unwilling to try video chatting, and my daughter has no interest in talking on the phone.\n\nThe grandparents periodically express some frustration over not having a better relationship with her, but I'm not sure what I can do. Sending her to visit on her own is not an option \u2014 they're a plane ride away and their area isn't the sort of place I would leave a multiracial child without parental supervision.\n\n\u2014 Just Really Different\n\nJust Really Different: Maybe I\u2019m being obtuse, but urban/rural, white collar/blue collar, liberal/conservative and not being close are emotional apples and oranges. At least they used to be.\n\n\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/The Washington Post)\n\nMaybe there\u2019s more to it that you didn\u2019t include, but if not, if it\u2019s just city vs. country mice, then seeing that as extra work vs. unworkable could encourage rapprochement.\n\nAnd also in that case, the strict one-visit-per-year limit seems more cruel and unusual than healthy and warranted.\n\nAnd cheez, \u201cno interest in talking on the phone\u201d is not an excuse. Please teach your child that remaining connected on a grandparent\u2019s terms is an act of love \u2014 and barely registers on the effort scale. Seriously.\n\nNow, if we\u2019re to extrapolate from \u201cmultiracial child\u201d that your husband\u2019s position is a boundary he enforces against racial prejudice, then some of this makes sense \u2014 except, if this were about race, why wouldn\u2019t that be in your first line?\n\nSo here\u2019s what I\u2019ve got: If your husband\u2019s anxiety is about the place and circumstances vs. the people, then ask him whether you and he have built the guardrails too high.\n\nIf his anxiety is about his parents themselves, then your obligation is to check in occasionally \u2014 \u201cAre we handling this right?\u201d \u2014 but otherwise be supportive of what he needs.\n\nI hope in that case, though, he made it clear to them the reason(s) he keeps them at bay. Assuming they should know by now is not a substitute for specifics, and it\u2019s torture not to know why.\n\nRe: Different: There may have been issues with the parents before the marriage. I am assuming \"Different\" is a different race and perhaps the parents expressed concerns to him before the marriage. This happened to my brother, and his wife (also a different race) never knew. Once they married, my parents came around and built a strong relationship with her. My brother never forgot the initial reaction, and maybe that's what's going on here as well.\n\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\nAnonymous: So, a \u201cmajor issue\u201d the writer isn\u2019t privy to \u2014 plausible explanation, thanks.", "By the end of what had been a very long night, Capitals forward T.J. Oshie had two stitches at the side of his left eye and a wide smile plastered on his face. When he was helped to the locker room with 16:33 left in the game, his teammates assumed he wouldn\u2019t be back on the ice for the rest of the night. He already had survived one injury earlier in the evening, but two was probably too much.\n\nOshie was determined to return, hopping on a stationary bike, answering questions and then passing a balance test. He successfully got through the concussion protocol and made his way back to the bench with less than four minutes left in the game.\n\n\u201cYou get a little fired up when you\u2019re not allowed to be out there and you\u2019ve got to watch your teammates,\u201d Oshie said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it on TV, but all the guys that weren\u2019t playing were in a part of the training room, and when I came out, they said that Pittsburgh was taking it to us and [goaltender Braden Holtby] was standing on his head.\u201d\n\nCollecting a pass from defenseman John Carlson in the slot, Oshie scored the go-ahead goal with 1:14 left in regulation to deliver the Capitals a 2-1 win over the Penguins. Washington has won two games in a row for the first time this season.\n\n[Summary: Capitals 2, Penguins 1]\n\n\u201cYou never want to see a teammate in that situation, but the term \u2018warrior\u2019 is brought up, and that\u2019s T.J. Oshie to a tee,\u201d Holtby said. \u201cThe way our game was going, once he came back, that gave us life. Guys like him, leaders like him, they know when to show up. You can tell once he stepped back on the ice that he had a mission to score and give it to them that way.\u201d\n\n\n\nWashington\u2019s Evgeny Kuznetsov and Pittsburgh\u2019s Patric Hornqvist tussle during the first period at Capital One Arena. (Will Newton/Getty Images)\n\nLess than five minutes into the game, Penguins defenseman Olli Maatta clipped Oshie in the face with a high stick with the blade going under Oshie\u2019s visor and catching him near the eye. He missed the rest of the period and got two stitches before returning for the start of the second period.\n\nThen with the game tied at 1 to start the third period, Capitals center Travis Boyd was called for holding, and on the ensuing power play, Pittsburgh\u2019s Evgeni Malkin was called for an illegal check to the head of Oshie when his shoulder collided with Oshie and knocked him to the ground. Malkin was ejected, and Oshie had to be helped off the ice and to the locker room.\n\n\u201cHe maybe thought I was coming to hit him, and so he threw the reverse shoulder out there, which I try to do that all the time,\u201d Oshie said. \u201cI did it at least once tonight. I just wasn\u2019t expecting it being on the [penalty kill]. You don\u2019t typically go for hits. He caught me there, and it is what it is. I passed my concussion test, went out and won the game. We\u2019re feeling good in here.\u201d\n\nThough the NHL Department of Player Safety will closely examine the hit, the early indication is that it won\u2019t lead to supplemental discipline for Malkin because he appeared to be bracing for impact from Oshie.\n\n[Barry Svrluga: A nasty, chippy game against the rival Penguins was just what the Capitals needed]\n\n\n\nCapitals goalie Braden Holtby makes a save on a shot by the Penguins\u2019 Dominik Simon (12) as defenseman Christian Djoos (29) clears him from in front of the net.

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s definitely a blow to the head,\u201d Washington Coach Todd Reirden said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we had to have T.J. leave and go through a concussion protocol. Those are things we\u2019re trying to remove from the game. . . . We\u2019re just really fortunate that it wasn\u2019t something that was more serious and he was able to come back.\u201d\n\nMalkin was assessed a major penalty, so the Capitals had nearly four minutes of power-play time. But they weren\u2019t able to capitalize, and after the game, Holtby said poor ice conditions might have played a role in that. Though Washington lost momentum from the failed power play, it got it back from Oshie\u2019s return.\n\n\u201cHe had some fresh legs,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cBoth teams were kind of wearing each other down at that point. You could tell he was extra fresh, and he was able to make something out of nothing, really. . . . He was on the wall. It\u2019s probably one of the fastest I think I\u2019ve seen him skate, around the top of the circle there, and I just tried to make a play to him. And there was enough traffic in front that the goalie couldn\u2019t really see where I was going with it.\u201d\n\nBecause it was the Washington Capitals and the Pittsburgh Penguins, it started as Alex Ovechkin vs. Sidney Crosby, the two captains and biggest stars of their generation, scoring the first two goals of the game. Then it became a goaltending duel with Holtby and Pittsburgh\u2019s Casey DeSmith keeping the score knotted at 1. Holtby won that matchup with his best performance in what has been a rocky start to the season for him, saving a whopping 41 shots.\n\nJust like his teammates, Holtby had an uneven start to the season with moments of brilliance and also some costly blunders. Entering the game, he had a 3.62 goals against average and an .888 save percentage. On Wednesday night, he caught a few breaks with several Penguins shots bouncing off the goal posts, but he looked poised as he stopped 25 shots through the first 40 minutes as the Capitals again had some sloppy moments in front of him.\n\nHe continued to buy them time in the third period until Oshie returned and made the considerable beating he took all night worth it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever had one like that,\u201d Oshie said. \u201cBut it was nice to get back out there both times. I have to throw a shout-out to the training staff and the doctors both times.

But the disgruntled running back would still apparently rather post tweets than report to the Steelers.\n\nA terse Twitter post by Bell on Monday, in which he bade farewell to Miami, where he had been training while holding out from his NFL team, gave many the impression that his next stop would be Pittsburgh. That appears to have been the case, but so far, he has been more interested in playing basketball than the sport he could have been making millions by playing this season.\n\nHe also was interested on Wednesday in making something of a defense of his lengthy absence from the Steelers, who placed a $14.55 million franchise tag on Bell this summer after failing to come to an agreement on a long-term contract. With an eye toward getting a lucrative deal from another team in free agency next spring \u2014 as long as he stays healthy \u2014 the three-time Pro Bowler has declined thus far to sign the one-year offer, in the process costing himself over $855,000 each week since the regular season began.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not apologizing for what I believe is right for myself, family and the rest of my peers, period,\u201d Bell said in a Twitter post rendered in upside-down text. \u201cAlso if you\u2019re really finding the time to figure out what I\u2019m saying, you\u2019ve proved my point.\u201d\n\n\u0287u\u0131od \u028e\u026f p\u01dd\u028co\u0279d \u01dd\u028c\u2019no\u028e 'bu\u0131\u028e\u0250s \u026f\u2019\u0131 \u0287\u0250\u0265\u028d \u0287no \u01dd\u0279nb\u0131\u025f o\u0287 \u01dd\u026f\u0131\u0287 \u01dd\u0265\u0287 bu\u0131pu\u0131\u025f \u028e\u05df\u05df\u0250\u01dd\u0279 \u01dd\u0279\u2019no\u028e \u025f\u0131 os\u05df\u0250\u02d9\u02d9\u02d9po\u0131\u0279\u01ddd 's\u0279\u01dd\u01ddd \u028e\u026f \u025fo \u0287s\u01dd\u0279 \u01dd\u0265\u0287 pu\u0250 '\u028e\u05df\u0131\u026f\u0250\u025f '\u025f\u05df\u01dds\u028e\u026f \u0279o\u025f \u0287\u0265b\u0131\u0279 s\u0131 \u01dd\u028c\u01dd\u0131\u05df\u01ddq \u0131 \u0287\u0250\u0265\u028d \u0279o\u025f bu\u0131z\u0131bo\u05dfod\u0250 \u0287ou \u026f\u2019\u0131 \u2014 Le'Veon Bell (@LeVeonBell) November 7, 2018\n\nAccording to ESPN\u2019s Jeremy Fowler, who noted that there was \u201cno indication Wednesday that Bell had visited the team\u2019s facility,\u201d a manager of a Pittsburgh gym confirmed that Bell was shooting hoops there on Tuesday. He has until Tuesday to sign with the Steelers if he wants to play football this season, but there could be significant financial incentives for him not to do so.\n\nAs Fowler pointed out, the Steelers would be very unlikely to place a third straight franchise tag on Bell after this season, because that would obligate them to pay him more than $20 million, an exorbitant sum for a non-quarterback, for the 2019 campaign. The team would have the option, though, of applying a transition tag, which would mean paying him 120 percent of his previous salary.\n\nBecause Bell has not been paid anything this season, that salary figure could come from the 2017 season, when he made $12.1 million, so the transition tag would garner him around $14.5 million next year. However, if he signs before Tuesday and ends up playing in, say, six games at full pay, that would mean he earned $5.13 million this year, and 120 percent of that would be roughly $6.2 million.\n\nIf that\u2019s how it plays out, Bell and the players\u2019 union would almost certainly contest any attempt by the Steelers to set such a relatively low 2019 salary figure for him, but he might decide to simply avoid that scenario by sitting out the rest of the season. Doing so, though, would cost him a year of NFL service, which would have implications for his pension, health care benefits, 401(k) plan and other financial calculations.\n\nThere has been speculation that Bell and the Steelers may have already come to an informal understanding, one in which they agree to simply let him walk in free agency without placing any tag on him, if he stays away from the team for the rest of the season. It\u2019s possible, if the Steelers have yet to clearly signal that they are willing to go along with this arrangement, that his arrival in Pittsburgh is meant to prod them into doing so.\n\nThe Steelers would have reason to possibly prefer that Bell stays away, given that the team has attained a solid 5-2-1 record in his absence, with backup running back James Conner making his own Pro Bowl bid.

Their season, before the arrival of the Pittsburgh Penguins, was all cream of wheat and unbuttered white bread, a cup of water \u2014 no ice \u2014 to the side. They needed the kind of Sriracha sauce only the Penguins can bring them this early. Some sizzle, please.\n\nEnter Sidney Crosby. Enter the Penguins. Yeah, Pittsburgh had lost four straight. Yeah, both teams carried ho-hum 6-4-3 records. But it has to be against Pittsburgh that T.J. Oshie took a stick to the face, drawing blood and boos \u2014 and came back anyway. It has to be against Pittsburgh that Oshie absorbed Evgeni Malkin\u2019s right shoulder with his head \u2014 immediately bringing concussion worries \u2014 and came back to score the goal with a minute and change left that delivered a 2-1 victory.\n\n[Summary: Capitals 2, Penguins 1]\n\n\u201cFace is a little messed up,\u201d said Oshie, a new Frankenstein stitch mark across the bridge of his nose. \u201cBut feelin\u2019 pretty good now.\u201d\n\nThe Capitals didn\u2019t play that well. They needed each one of Braden Holtby\u2019s 41 saves. Pittsburgh looked more physical and, at times, faster. But before Wednesday, the Capitals \u2014 excuse me, the defending Stanley Cup champion Capitals \u2014 hadn\u2019t won even two straight games. Now, even on a night they were outplayed, they might have the jolt this season needed.\n\n\u201cWe feel like this is a big week for us,\u201d center Nicklas Backstrom said. Wins over Edmonton and Pittsburgh are behind them, with division rival Columbus still ahead. Excitement, engagement, interest \u2014 they all seem possible.\n\n\n\nEvgeny Kuznetsov and Patric Hornqvist get into a pushing match in the first period. (Will Newton/Getty Images)\n\nThat\u2019s been the thing: With these Caps, there\u2019s not really anything to lose sleep over. But there\u2019s also not much to get out of bed for, either. Given the enormity of this past spring\u2019s accomplishment, maybe that\u2019s kind of a best-case scenario. No team played more hockey than the Capitals last year, 106 games combined in the regular season and the playoffs. Throw in a few extra beers and a day with the Cup for each and every character, and, well, a home game against Florida in October might not boil your blood.\n\nThey needed Pittsburgh. Maybe that\u2019s what it took for Holtby to refocus because he played his best game. Maybe that\u2019s what it took to get the Capital One Arena crowd reengaged.\n\n[T.J. Oshie returns from hits, scores winner in Caps\u2019 2-1 victory]\n\n\u201cPlaying a top-tier team, that\u2019s fun,\u201d veteran defenseman Matt Niskanen said. \u201cNo offense to some teams, but yeah, there\u2019s not a whole lot of excitement there at some points in October. But they count the same.\u201d\n\nIt just doesn\u2019t feel like it. So it was refreshing to welcome an opponent for which no faux motivation is needed. Even after taking the Cup and going through Pittsburgh to do it, the Penguins remain the Penguins. So when Crosby lingers a little longer to argue with the ref about one slight or another, he\u2019s going to hear it \u2014 in a rather spirited fashion \u2014 from the crowd. When Carl Hagelin flattens Holtby in the crease, Alex Ovechkin is going to arrive swiftly in the corner to, um, discuss the matter with Hagelin, and a scrum will ensue.\n\nAnd when Malkin skates into the Capitals\u2019 zone on a Penguins\u2019 power play in the third period, gets rid of the puck and then unloads his right shoulder into Oshie\u2019s head \u2014 well, there\u2019s the shot to really put the game on edge. Malkin received a five-minute major for an illegal check to the head and a game misconduct. Oshie wobbled to the dressing room.\n\nOf course this happened against Pittsburgh. And, of course, Oshie came back and buried the game-winner.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain level of hate,\u201d Oshie said earlier in the day. \u201cThere\u2019s a level of respect. And when you mix those in, it usually makes for a pretty nasty, fun hockey game.\u201d\n\nBy the end, it was both. The non-Oshie goals came from Crosby and Ovechkin, each on the power play, which is still as it should be. Ovi vs. Sid, Caps vs. Pens, and the season is no longer a slog. The emotions are again right there.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s a pragmatic element to Wednesday night\u2019s events: By getting two clean points against Pittsburgh, Washington vaulted to second in the Metropolitan Division, trailing the New York Islanders (and former coach Barry Trotz) by just a point, and kept the Penguins reeling.\n\nAnd yet they still understand their reality.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve been middling way too much in our game,\u201d said defenseman John Carlson, who set up Oshie\u2019s game-winner. \u201cThe consistency hasn\u2019t been there.\u201d\n\n\u201cInconsistent\u201d is the word new Coach Todd Reirden thinks fits best, too. Before Thanksgiving, that\u2019s fine. What this team is not \u2014 and this is important \u2014 is dead. Through 14 games a year ago, the Caps were 7-6-1 \u2014 a remarkably similar, blah record. But in the dressing room, there was concern. It seems so long ago now, but the seven-game loss to the Penguins in the 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs nearly flattened the entire organization. The devastation lingered. You wondered whether these guys even wanted to be around each other.\n\nNow, though, they\u2019re collectively coming off their greatest triumph. They have, minus a fourth-line center and backup goaltender, the same team. So when Reirden says, \u201cI think most teams through the first 20 games are still starting to form their identity and how they want to play,\u201d shouldn\u2019t this be a team that already knows who it is?\n\nIt\u2019s not that easy.\n\n\u201cI used to think that it wouldn\u2019t be different at all from the year before,\u201d Niskanen said. \u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve realized, you\u2019ve got to rebuild everything every year.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the rebuilding this year has come without Tom Wilson, the rugged winger Washington deemed worthy of a six-year, $31 million contract in the offseason. Wilson has six more games to serve before the completion of his 20-game suspension for a needless preseason hit.\n\nWhat you find in watching the Caps without Wilson is that Wilson just might be worth all the money they paid him. The top line of Ovechkin and Evgeny Kuznetsov functions properly when Wilson is there to create loose pucks that Kuzy gathers up, when Wilson is there to fly back on defense, when Wilson is there to create space for the other two. With Wilson, the lineup falls into place. Without him, Reirden has tried five different players at right wing, the latest being Dmitrij Jaskin \u2014 a guy they picked up off the waiver wire because they were preparing for Wilson\u2019s suspension.\n\nSo there\u2019s unevenness here, and it\u2019s to be expected. It\u2019s even to be forgiven. But what we know about the Capitals this year: Pittsburgh still brings out the fun, they\u2019re still finding themselves \u2014 and they\u2019re still the Stanley Cup champs.\n\nFor more by Barry Svrluga, visit washingtonpost.com/svrluga.", "FILE - In this Nov. 3, 2018, file photo, Florida quarterback Kyle Trask throws a pass during the second half of an NCAA college football game against Missouri in Gainesville, Fla.

The 19th-ranked Gators (6-3, 4-3 Southeastern Conference, No. 15 CFP) declined comment when asked about Trask\u2019s injury, which was first reported by 247sports.com.\n\n\u201cGator Nation, I am sad to say that Kyle was injured today in practice while doing a trick play where he hands off to the RB and then goes out for a pass,\u201d Michael Trask posted. \u201cThe throw to Kyle was low and when he planted his foot to catch the pass he felt a pop. Unfortunately he fractured his foot and will be out for the season. Just a freak injury. The good news is that it will be minor surgery and he will be 100% for spring ball in 2019. Thank you for all the well wishes and support for Kyle, we appreciate you very much! Continue to pray for Kyle\u2019s recovery.\u201d\n\nCoach Dan Mullen had been deciding between Feleipe Franks and Trask to start against South Carolina (5-3, 4-3) in the Swamp on Saturday, but it now appears Franks will be the choice. Mullen has made it clear he wants to redshirt highly touted freshman Emory Jones.\n\nFranks was benched last week in a 38-17 loss to Missouri . He completed 9 of 22 passes for 84 yards. Trask replaced Franks in the third quarter and completed 10 of 18 passes for 126 yards and a touchdown.\n\nTrask, a redshirt sophomore, had foot surgery in 2017 and missed the season. It\u2019s unclear if he broke the same foot.\n\nMullen said Monday that Franks wasn\u2019t totally at fault for the team\u2019s offensive failures, which include scoring 17 points in consecutive games. The coach said Franks was under heavy pressure on several throws, pinning a portion of the problems on the team\u2019s offensive line.\n\nWhen asked about the QB competition Wednesday, Mullen declined to provide details about his plan at the all-important position.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to share what our strategy is,\u201d Mullen said on the weekly SEC coaches teleconference. \u201cI haven\u2019t done that all year, so I don\u2019t plan on sharing that strategy just yet.\u201d\n\nFranks has 16 touchdown passes and six interceptions in his second season as a starter.\n\nHe played in 11 games last year, with eight starts, and finished with nine touchdown passes and eight interceptions. He now has been benched in three games and lost his starting job two other times.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The move comes after a tense clash between Acosta and President Trump during a post-election news conference on Wednesday, during which the correspondent sought answers on presidential rhetoric on immigration and developments in the special counsel investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Acosta tweeted about the immediate impact of the White House\u2019s action:\n\nI\u2019ve just been denied entrance to the WH. Secret Service just informed me I cannot enter the WH grounds for my 8pm hit \u2014 Jim Acosta (@Acosta) November 8, 2018\n\nThe US Secret Service just asked for my credential to enter the WH.

(Sorry this video is not rightside up) pic.twitter.com/juQeuj3B9R \u2014 Jim Acosta (@Acosta) November 8, 2018\n\nDuring the news conference, Acosta asked the president about his use of the term \u201cinvasion\u201d to describe the caravan of migrants making their way north through Mexico toward the U.S. border. Though Trump started the session with cheery words about his party\u2019s exploits in the midterms, he turned sour in his interactions with reporters \u2014 especially with Acosta, a longtime target of official ire from White House lecterns.\n\n\u201cI think you should let me run the country, you run CNN and if you did it well, your ratings would be much better,\u201d replied Trump, who also called Acosta a \u201crude, terrible person.\u201d As Trump tried to ditch Acosta and take a question from NBC News\u2019s Peter Alexander, Acosta persisted:\n\nAcosta: But let me ask, if I \u2014 if I may ask one other question \u2014 President Trump: Okay, that\u2019s enough. Acosta: Mr. President, if I may \u2014 if I may ask one other question. Trump: Okay, Peter, go ahead. Acosta: Are you worried \u2014 Trump: That\u2019s enough. That\u2019s enough. That\u2019s enough. Acosta: Mr. President, I didn\u2019t \u2014 well, I was going to ask one other. The other folks that had \u2014 Trump: That\u2019s enough. That\u2019s enough. Acosta: Pardon me, ma\u2019am, I\u2019m \u2014 Mr. President . . .\n\nThe \u201cma\u2019am,\u201d here, is a White House intern who was assigned the undignified task of pulling the microphone from eager-beaver White House reporters, even as their questions were being cut off by the president. The task is a variation on the work performed by so-called White House media \u201cwranglers\u201d who, after ceremonial photo-ops \u2014 \u201cpool sprays\u201d in the industry vernacular \u2014 shout at reporters and photographers to get the heck out of the room. Clearing out the journalists has become treacherous for the wranglers because Trump can never seem to decide when he\u2019s done answering a question. Wrangling is among the worst jobs in the Trump economy.\n\nAs the intern attempted to grab the microphone away from Acosta and pass it along to Alexander, Acosta wouldn\u2019t surrender it. As he held tight, he said, \u201cPardon me, ma\u2019am.\u201d Here is the incident from different angles:\n\nHere\u2019s a gif of the interaction between @Acosta and the intern who tried to pass on the mic to another reporter pic.twitter.com/FaiBzfYNW2 \u2014 Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) November 8, 2018\n\nI was seated next to \u2066@Acosta\u2069 at today\u2019s press conference and did not witness him \u201cplacing his hands\u201d on the young intern, as the White House alleges.

The \u2066@Reuters\u2069 pictures below depict what happened accurately. pic.twitter.com/nO68Hf4eQM \u2014 Jeff Mason (@jeffmason1) November 8, 2018\n\nIn a statement on the matter, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said:\n\nPresident Trump believes in a free press and expects and welcomes tough questions of him and his Administration. We will, however, never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern. This conduct is absolutely unacceptable. It is also completely disrespectful to the reporter\u2019s colleagues not to allow them an opportunity to ask a question. President Trump has given the press more access than any President in history. Contrary to CNN\u2019s assertions, there is no greater demonstration of the President\u2019s support for a free press than the event he held today. Only they would attack the President for not being supportive of a free press in the midst of him taking 68 questions from 35 different reporters over the course of an hour and a half \u2014 including several from the reporter in question. The fact that CNN is proud of the way their employee behaved is not only disgusting, it is an example of their outrageous disregard for everyone, including young women, who work in this Administration. As a result of today\u2019s incident, the White House is suspending the hard pass of the reporter involved until further notice.\n\nAcosta replied:\n\nThis is a lie. https://t.co/FastFfWych \u2014 Jim Acosta (@Acosta) November 8, 2018\n\nCNN and the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association struck similar themes in statement on the dispute:\n\nEscalation of this sort wasn\u2019t hard to foresee. At one point, Acosta reported on air that Sanders had made noises about barring him from future pool sprays if he asked the president a question. At another point, Sanders said to Acosta, \u201cI Know It\u2019s Hard for You to Understand Even Short Sentences.\u201d At many other points, Acosta has sparred with Sanders and Trump, often over their anti-media rhetoric. And the president, of course, has anointed CNN first among equals as a target of his never-ending anti-media campaign.\n\nThe Erik Wemple Blog won\u2019t say that Acosta on Wednesday presented a model of perfect decorum. When a White House emissary lunges for the microphone in your hand, give up the microphone and let the president\u2019s petulant insistence on cutting off reporters and moving to other questioners speak for itself. And it speaks loudly: Whatever lines Acosta walked up to in the East Room, Trump, again, walked blissfully across, as he spoke disrespectfully to anyone who dared ask him a difficult question. When a black reporter for the PBS NewsHour, Yamiche Alcindor, asked Trump about the racial dimension of his self-identification as a \u201cnationalist,\u201d Trump accused her of asking a \u201cracist\u201d question. There were several other such examples.\n\nStill more outrageous is the White House\u2019s yanking of Acosta\u2019s hard pass. The heavy-handed and authoritarian gesture boils down to a chilling reality: Your president has begun choosing who gets to ask him questions.\n\nHow unprecedented is this? From preliminary research, very. The Erik Wemple Blog asked George Condon, a longtime White House reporter and historian on matters such as these. He passed along a piece in Foreign Policy that outlined the case of Robert Sherrill of the Nation, who was denied Secret Service clearance because of the threat he posed to President Lyndon B. Johnson. Condon takes it from there:\n\nIn the early years after the [White House Correspondents\u2019 Association] was founded [in 1914], it was the correspondents themselves who determined credentials to attend presidential press conferences. They often denied access to business publications and to individuals they did not think worked for legitimate publications. That is not comparable to today\u2019s situation. In 1937, [President Franklin Roosevelt] drew very annoyed at questions from a reporter about whether he would run for third term. He didn\u2019t ban him but he insulted him and told him to sit in the corner wearing a dunce cap. (Hard to find a corner in the Oval Office, though.) In 1942, he was furious at columns by John O\u2019Donnell and gave a Nazi Iron Cross to another reporter and asked him to give it to O\u2019Donnell. But he never banned him. Since then, there have been several presidents angry at reporters. But I don\u2019t know of anything comparable to this.\n\nThere is nothing comparable to this \u2014 on the issue of White House access and many, many other fronts.\n\nRead more:\n\nRepublicans lost the House, so Trump took it out on the media\n\nNot praising Trump enough is now \u2018fake news\u2019\n\nFox News correspondent issues on-air correction related to Trump \u2018fake news\u2019 tweet\n\nCable news networks agree: \u2018The stakes could not be higher\u2019\n\nFox News\u2019s Sean Hannity: Proud to be a Trump operative", "\n\nFloyd Mayweather, left, shakes hands with Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa during a news conference in Tokyo.

The 41-year-old boxer said that he \u201cnever agreed to an official bout\u201d and instead was under the impression that he was going to participate in an \u201cexhibition\u201d match in front of a \u201csmall group of wealthy spectators.\u201d\n\nMayweather appeared at a Tokyo news conference Monday with Nasukawa, ostensibly to promote the fight, but he said Wednesday that when he arrived at the media session, he and his team were \u201ccompletely derailed by the new direction this event was going,\u201d adding that they \u201cshould have put a stop to it immediately.\u201d He said he had been led to believe that he would be part of a \u201cspecial bout\u201d that was \u201cpurely for entertainment purposes with no intentions of being represented as an official fight card nor televised worldwide.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to sincerely apologize to my fans for the very misleading information that was announced during this press conference,\u201d Mayweather said in his post, \u201cand I can assure you that I too was completely blindsided by the arrangements that were being made without my consent nor approval.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Nasukawa had furthered the impression that the fight would be more or less \u201cofficial.\u201d In a Twitter post aimed at Conor McGregor\u2019s profane, heckling response to the news conference, Nasukawa referred to the Irish MMA star\u2019s 2017 loss to Mayweather in a boxing match by saying, \u201cI promise to avenge your loss, so please watch my fight.\u201d\n\nA news release issued Monday by Rizin, the MMA company staging the fight, said (via MMA Mania) that Mayweather was set to take on Nasukawa at its Dec. 31 event at Saitama Super Arena. According to the company, the only major issues for the fight were related to its format, leaving many observers suspecting that it would be boxing-only but intrigued with the possibility that at least some MMA rules might be in place.\n\n\u201cAs far as the weight class and the rules, we\u2019ll talk about that and we\u2019ll get that situated within the next couple of weeks,\u201d Mayweather said at the news conference (via Yahoo Sports). \u201cThis particular bout is a special bout as far as we\u2019re giving the people something they\u2019ve never seen before. The world has never seen Mayweather compete live in Tokyo.\"\n\nThe undefeated boxer, who has a 50-0 record (Nasukawa is 27-0 in kickboxing, 4-0 in MMA matches), also said Monday that he was eager to bolster his partnership with Rizin while growing his brand in Japan. \u201cI would love to continue to work with Rizin because Rizin is an unbelievable company,\u201d he said, \u201cand my company, we\u2019ve been making some huge fights happen in the U.S., but we look forward to taking the Mayweather Promotions banner and the TMT banner worldwide.\u201d\n\nIn his post Wednesday, Mayweather pointed to an apparent disconnect between what he was told by Brent Johnson, a Los Angeles-based entertainment executive who reportedly helped Rizin officials conceive of the match, and what the Japanese company was touting at the news conference. Mayweather claimed that he didn\u2019t contradict them at the time because he was \u201chesitant to create a huge disturbance by combating what was being said.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily sound like the Mayweather that fight fans have seen \u2014 and heard \u2014 for the past two decades, he has been far from a shrinking violet at media events and on other occasions. It\u2019s possible that he was a bit cowed by being on foreign soil with unfamiliar promotional partners, but in any event, it remains to be seen if some version of the fight moves forward.\n\nThere have been reports of Mayweather\u2019s interest in possible rematches with McGregor and/or Manny Pacquiao, but the last line in his Instagram post appeared to be intended to give the impression that his career as a fighter in officially sanctioned bouts that would count toward his record was over, even if his dedication to raking in as much revenue as possible was very much in full swing. \u201cI am a retired boxer that earns an unprecedented amount of money, globally, for appearances, speaking engagements and occasional small exhibitions,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nLaMelo Ball is returning to high school basketball, and it\u2019s already absurd\n\nNBA players were as impressed with Duke\u2019s rout of Kentucky as everyone else\n\nESPN\u2019s Stephen A.

Both will benefit.", "In this Oct. 19, 2018 photo, a visitor stands by the train carriage in which the armistice of the Nov. 11, 1918 was signed, in the forest of Compiegne, north of Paris. The French and German leaders this weekend will jointly visit the remains of the train carriage where the armistice ending World War I was signed on Nov. 11, 1918. For the French, the dining car became a shrine to peace. For Adolf Hitler, it was a symbol of the humiliation of surrender. The Nazi leader had it dragged to Germany after conquering France in World War II. (Thibault Camus/Associated Press)\n\nCOMPIEGNE, France \u2014 Adolf Hitler went in wartime for revenge. Angela Merkel plans a pilgrimage in the name of peace. Two German chancellors, with opposite aims and the same destination: a train car in a French forest.\n\nHitler tried literally to rewrite history in 1940 when the Nazi leader commandeered the dining coach to serve France the same humiliation Germany suffered there on the last day of World War I.\n\nThis time, Merkel will have the French president by her side as she visits what remains of the Wagon of Compiegne, the carriage-turned-office where the Allies and Germany signed the armistice on Nov. 11, 1918.\n\nAn unusual journey took Wagons-Lits Co. carriage 2419D from serving sauteed veal and boeuf bourguignon to passengers in the seaside town of Deauville to serving as a crucible for world peace while stopped in the middle of a forest in Compiegne.\n\nPuzzled tourists often ask Bernard Letemps, the curator of the Armistice Museum, why the Allies signed the cease-fire agreement that ended the atrocities of the Western Front in that humble setting instead of a grand military building or a glittering palace.\n\nAt the time, the official headquarters in Senlis of the Allied commander, French Marshal Ferdinand Foch, would have been the expected place to sign a cease-fire.\n\nBut the town had endured a brutal German assault. Its inhabitants were taken hostage and its mayor shot in September 1914, before the first Battle of the Marne. How the bruised townspeople would react to the presence of a German delegation, even one coming with the goal of peace, was a serious concern.\n\n\u201cIt was out of the question to receive the plenipotentiary Germans in (such a) town,\u201d Letemps said.\n\nA moveable train carriage in the nearby Compiegne forest was deemed ideal: The isolated location would deter intruders and the calm and secrecy offered a measure of respect to the defeated Germans.\n\nAs it happened, Foch had fitted out a mobile office just the month before \u2014 a dining car chosen at random from the French passenger train fleet. And so 2419D became known as the \u201cWagon of Compiegne.\u201d\n\nThe Armistice was signed just after 5 a.m., but officials held out six hours to put it into effect out of a sense of poetry \u2014 the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month in 1918. That delay, rather unpoetically, cost lives on both sides at the end of a war that had already left 17 million dead.\n\n\u201cThe train car represents the end of fighting. The end, when people found peace,\u201d Letemps said.\n\nHe added, smiling: \u201cIt fulfilled its role of dining car before becoming famous.\u201d\n\nThe Armistice Museum lays on the train tracks on the site of the signing in the middle of forest.\n\nFoch was immortalized in statues ubiquitous across France and gave his name to one of the broad, leafy avenues radiating out from the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nThe same reception was not reserved for the losing side: One of the Germans to sign the document, Matthias Erzberger, was vilified for his role in the surrender. He was assassinated in 1921.\n\nThe story of dining car 2419D and Compiegne didn\u2019t end with the war.\n\nFor throngs of French mourners in the post-war years, the dining car became a shrine to peace and catharsis.\n\nThe car was taken to Paris for display in the courtyard of the Invalides, the final resting place of Napoleon, before it went back to Compiegne in 1927 to sit in a specially-made memorial constructed on the site of today\u2019s museum.\n\nLetemps said the wagon received over 190,000 visitors in one year alone in the 1930s as it became a focus for mourning France\u2019s 1.4 million fallen soldiers.\n\nFor Hitler in those same years, it became a rallying cry during his ascent to power as he exploited the German public\u2019s contempt for the punitive terms of surrender.\n\nThe Nazi leader visited the site in 1940 when his armies conquered France.\n\nThe Fuhrer ordered the dining car brought out of the memorial and returned to the tracks in the spot in the forest it occupied in 1918.\n\nWhat ensued was Hitler\u2019s surreal theatrical restaging of the 1918 armistice, one of history\u2019s most famous events, with literally the tables\u2019 turned.\n\nThe 1940 Armistice was dictated in that train \u2014 with Germany the victor and France the loser.\n\n\u201cGeneral (Wilhelm) Keitel read the conditions for the Armistice in the car, with Chancellor Hitler sitting in the place of Marshal Foch,\u201d Letemps said.\n\nHitler then ordered the car to be hauled to Germany and displayed, like a notorious prisoner of war, at the Berlin Cathedral.\n\nThe dining car was destroyed at the end of World War II, though how that happened has been lost to time. Some accounts blame members of the Nazi SS, others a random airstrike.\n\nIn 1950, French manufacturer Wagons-Lits, the company that ran the Orient Express, donated a car from the same series to the museum \u2014 2439D is identical to its ravaged twin from its polished wooden finishes to its studded, leather-bound chairs. It is parked beside the display of the original car remains: a few fragments of bronze decoration and two access ramps.\n\nOn Saturday, Merkel becomes the first German chancellor in 78 years to visit the forest clearing where the end of the globe\u2019s first conflict was written.\n\nShe will be joined by French President Emmanuel Macron in a scene reminiscent of 1984 when Chancellor Helmut Kohl poignantly held President Francois Mitterrand\u2019s hand at an ossuary near Verdun.\n\nOn the centenary of the conflict\u2019s end, this visit will make for soul-searing images of its own.\n\n___\n\nThomas Adamson can be followed at Twitter.com/ThomasAdamson_K\n\n___\n\nFull coverage of WWI commemoration events at: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___\n\n\u201cWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition\u201d is available now exclusively on Amazon: https://amzn.to/2JGrx5U\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nRepublican Brian Kemp\u2019s campaign declared victory in the race for Georgia governor on Wednesday, even as election officials continued counting thousands of absentee and provisional ballots, narrowing his lead and prompting Democrat Stacey Abrams to insist she could have the votes to force a runoff election.\n\nAs the vote-counting continued, voting rights advocates accused Kemp \u2014 who as secretary of state is Georgia\u2019s top election officer \u2014 and local officials of disenfranchising thousands of voters on Election Day. Hundreds of complaints flooded in about hours-long lines brought on by broken equipment, a shortage of voting machines and insufficient quantities of printed provisional ballots.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Kemp was ahead with 50.3 percent of the vote to Abrams\u2019s 48.7 percent. Abrams and the Libertarian candidate would need to gain at least 25,000 votes more than Kemp to bring his share of the vote below 50 percent and trigger a runoff.\n\n\u201cWe believe our chance for a stronger Georgia is just within reach,\u201d Abrams, who if elected would be the nation\u2019s first black female governor, told supporters early Wednesday. \u201cWe cannot seize it, however, until all voices are heard. And we are going to make sure that every vote is counted \u2014 because in a civilized nation, the machinery of democracy should work everywhere for everyone.\u201d\n\nThe secretary of state\u2019s office reported late Wednesday that fewer than 3,000 regular ballots remained to be counted statewide, and that a total of 22,000 provisional ballots had been cast \u2014 numbers that would likely close off any path to victory for Abrams. The office did not certify a winner and said votes could be counted into next week.\n\nYet Cody Hall, a spokesman for Kemp\u2019s campaign, said: \u201cAbrams does not have a mathematical formula to victory, based on our calculations. We have a clear path to victory. We\u2019re declaring victory and we are moving forward with the transition process starting tomorrow.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, the Abrams campaign claimed that nearly 100,000 ballots, and possibly more, remained uncounted.\n\nAmong the calls logged at a voter hotline run by a consortium of voting rights groups including the NAACP, the American Civil Liberties Union and Common Cause were complaints from hundreds of voters who said their requests for absentee ballots went unanswered. Voters \u2014 and advocates \u2014 said they were chagrined at how many of those reports came from communities with large minority populations.\n\n\u201cFrom our vantage point, this was an intentional system failure in targeting communities where African Americans made up a high percentage of active voters,\u201d said NAACP President Derrick Johnson.\n\nPeggy Xu, 23, was one of those voters. Xu provided emails to The Washington Post showing that she requested an absentee ballot from Fulton County on Oct. 6 and said she later saw on the secretary of state\u2019s website that one had been sent to her. But she never received it, she said. She tried again, didn\u2019t receive the second ballot either and was not able to vote, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m furious,\u201d she said. \u201cI was genuinely excited to vote for her. But now, seeing this razor-thin margin, and seeing how many voter suppression issues are going on, it\u2019s driving me a little crazy, especially knowing that this has affected so many voters.\u201d\n\n\n\nVoting machines sit unused in Georgia thanks to a lawsuit. On Election Day, a lack of voting machines led to long lines and complaints. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nAsked about the range of voter concerns, Candice Broce, a spokeswoman for the secretary of state\u2019s office, noted that the turnout shattered midterm records.\n\n\u201cI stand confident that we had a successful Election Day,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition, election monitors from civil rights groups said hundreds of voters whose registrations had been suspended under a strict new law, one championed by Kemp, were improperly turned away. The law requires that personal information on registration applications, even down to the hyphen, exactly match other government records. In late October, a federal judge ordered the state to alert such voters before removing them from the rolls and to allow them to vote with proper identification.\n\nAnother problem was the limited number of voting machines in some locations. More than 1,800 machines sat idle in storage in three of the state\u2019s largest and most heavily Democratic counties. In Fulton County, according to figures provided by elections director Rick Barron, the ratio of machines to registered voters was lower than it had been in 2014, despite predictions that turnout was likely to break records for a midterm election.\n\nWhile some voters waited in hours-long lines in Fulton County, 700 of those machines sat in stacks in a warehouse in downtown Atlanta, Barron said. The machines were sidelined because they are evidence in a lawsuit alleging the equipment had been exposed to the threat of hacking in 2016.\n\nThe federal judge in the case had ordered state and local election officials \u2014 including Kemp \u2014 and the plaintiffs to weigh the demands of upcoming elections in deciding how many machines to set aside.\n\nIn an interview, Barron said more machines \u201cwould have made a huge impact on operations yesterday\u201d and acknowledged that \u201cit would have been a good idea\u201d to push for the use of more machines before Election Day.\n\n\u201cThe lines were long in the morning and we just didn\u2019t have any machines to throw out there,\u201d he said.\n\nBroce, too, said additional machines \u201cwould have really helped with the long lines.\u201d\n\nShe blamed the litigation for tying up those machines. One attorney for the plaintiffs, Bruce Brown, called that \u201crubbish\u201d and said officials could have sequestered fewer machines, or later decided to put some back into service.\n\nDaniel White, an attorney representing Cobb and DeKalb counties, said both counties kept more machines out of circulation Tuesday than required by the judge \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d that they were complying with the spirit of the court agreement.\n\nWhite said he suspected the sequestered machines contributed to long lines at his polling place Tuesday. At a school in Marietta, where White said he usually sees eight to 12 machines, he saw just five or six.\n\nTuesday\u2019s ballot was long, with five constitutional amendments across the state and additional measures in select locations.\n\nOne precinct near Pittman Park in downtown Atlanta started the day with just three machines, despite a registered voter roll of more than 3,000. Similar equipment problems were reported elsewhere in Fulton County and in three other large counties of the Atlanta metro area \u2014 Cobb, DeKalb and Gwinnett.\n\nAbrams\u2019s campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo said the problems were Kemp\u2019s responsibility. \u201cMachines were breaking down and counties did not get guidance from the secretary of state and didn\u2019t have adequate paper ballots \u2014 let\u2019s be clear about where the blame lies,\u201d she said.\n\nBroce said local officials make those decisions, not the secretary of state.\n\n\u201cCounties are the custodians of the equipment and are responsible for deploying it,\u201d she said.\n\nVanessa Williams in Atlanta and Sonam Vashi in Athens, Ga., contributed to this report.

(Dolores Ochoa/Associated Press)\n\nQUITO, Ecuador \u2014 Ecuador\u2019s top court ordered former President Rafael Correa on Wednesday to stand trial for his alleged role in the 2012 botched kidnapping of an opposition lawmaker.\n\nCorrea was charged in September by prosecutors of orchestrating Fernando Balda\u2019s kidnapping in Bogota after he fled to Colombia\u2019s capital to escape what he considered persecution by Correa.\n\nA supreme court justice decided that the accusations against Correa, his top intelligence chief and two others merited a trial. Judge Daniel Camacho also formally declared Correa a \u201cfugitive\u201d after he flouted for months an order to appear before the court every 15 days as part of the ongoing probe. For his defiance, Ecuadorean authorities had previously requested Correa\u2019s arrest and extradition from Belgium, where he has been living since leaving office last year.\n\nCorrea has long denied the charges, considering them part of a political witch hunt headed by his hand-picked successor turned arch-critic, President Lenin Moreno. Late Wednesday, before the judge\u2019s ruling, he called the charges a \u201cfarce\u201d but said he was more worried about Ecuador\u2019s future than his own legal troubles.\n\n\u201cWe expected something like this because for weeks we\u2019ve been witnesses to the uncontrolled political pressure being applied to the judge,\u201d Caupolican Ochoa, Correa\u2019s attorney, said outside the court where a small group of Correa supporters had gathered.\n\nBalda said he took no pleasure in the legal victory because \u201cwe can\u2019t celebrate the fact that these criminal acts were ordered by a president.\u201d\n\nCorrea, a firebrand who governed Ecuador with an iron fist for a decade, garnered legions of supporters by promoting generous health and social programs aimed at reducing inequality. Supporters credit him with providing Ecuador political and economic stability after a tumultuous period in the nation\u2019s history.\n\nBut the combative leader also feuded with the media, business community, indigenous groups and environmentalists by pushing through measures that consolidated executive power. And his record has increasingly come under scrutiny since leaving power.\n\nIn addition to the kidnapping case, several top aides, including his former Vice President Jorge Glas, have either been jailed or are under investigation for corruption.\n\nBalda was abducted but quickly escaped harm after nearby taxi drivers alerted police, who stopped the vehicle in which he was being taken away. Colombian authorities later determined that three intelligence agents with Ecuador\u2019s police had contracted the kidnappers to abduct Balda.\n\nProceedings against Correa are unlikely to begin anytime soon because he can only be tried once in Ecuador. If found guilty, he faces up to 12 years in prison.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Colin Hackley/Reuters)\n\nAs cars clogged the parking lot outside Highlands Public Library, Tony Maxwell was certain his state was on the cusp of electing Florida\u2019s first black governor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see black people doing something early,\u201d said Maxwell, 53, an African American retired naval officer, voting two days before Election Day.\n\nGillum\u2019s candidacy elicited an excitement on Jacksonville\u2019s predominantly black north side that was unseen since the election of Barack Obama as president.\n\n\u201cWhen we vote, we win,\u201d was one of Gillum\u2019s trademark phrases, and Maxwell and his friends believed it.\n\nThey voted. Still, their candidate lost.\n\nDemocrats in Florida and Georgia awoke Wednesday feeling a complicated mix of emotions after two rising black political stars and would-be governors appeared to fall painfully short of victory.\n\nThat pain was even more acute in African American communities, which sought to show how powerful they could be as a voting bloc in a divisive political period. There was deep disappointment, of course, and in some cases defiance and anger, over racist attacks that targeted both candidates, and, at times, hope that perhaps important lessons were learned for future candidacies.\n\n\u201cHe ran a good race, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see the last of him,\u201d Maxwell said Wednesday. \u201cAll I can do is continue to push how important it is for young people to vote. We have to get there.\u201d\n\nIn some ways, Gillum, 39, the mayor of Tallahassee, and Stacey Abrams, 44, a longtime Georgia state lawmaker, represented two of the Democratic Party\u2019s biggest heartbreaks of Tuesday\u2019s elections.\n\nBoth received help from former president Barack Obama and other African American figures in the final days. That support included an Abrams town hall hosted by Oprah Winfrey. The efforts helped spark unusually high turnout \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nAbrams and her supporters were defiant Wednesday, accusing Georgia Republicans of seeking to suppress the black vote.\n\nHer campaign held out hope that ongoing counting of absentee and provisional ballots would narrow the lead of Republican Brian Kemp enough to force a runoff \u2014 though by late in the day Wednesday, Kemp still remained above the 50-percent threshold. Kemp, who as secretary of state presides over Georgia\u2019s election system, declared victory late in the day.\n\nGeorgia election officials\u2019 actions reflected \u201ceither incompetence or corruption or both,\u201d said longtime civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who had campaigned for Abrams and Gillum in the closing days of the campaigns. He said it was inexcusable that at several polling sites in Atlanta, including at Morehouse College, not enough machines were provided, resulting in hours-long waits to vote. Jackson said Abrams is right to protest the results.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing honorable about being robbed. It\u2019s not something you do with dignity and compliance,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re robbed, you should cry out, and she\u2019s crying out, and she deserves support.\u201d\n\nFelicia Davis, an activist in Forest Park, just outside Atlanta, said she was dismayed by the voting problems but took solace in the large turnout by African Americans in Florida and Georgia. She also pointed to the candidacy of Democrat Ben Jealous, a former NAACP leader, who lost his bid for Maryland governor on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIn these two candidates, in Abrams and Gillum, and even Ben Jealous, they are young,\u201d she said. \u201cTo come this close, if they stay in, they\u2019re going to be winners.\u201d\n\nAnother Abrams supporter, Brandi Underwood, said the candidate deserves a recount, but she felt that regardless of the outcome, the campaign was in some ways a success.\n\n\u201cEven if she loses, it\u2019s like, wow, there is a Democratic presence in Georgia, whether they want to acknowledge it or not,\u201d said Underwood, 30, a stay-at-home mom and communications director for a local church who lives in suburban Augusta.\n\nGillum\u2019s loss was something of a shock to some. He had been leading Republican Ron DeSantis in several polls, and anticipation was building among liberals nationwide that he would make history in a state that had backed President Trump and had not elected a Democratic governor since 1994. After all, Florida had also backed Obama twice, proof that the state could vote for a black candidate.\n\nInstead, Gillum\u2019s narrow loss prompted soul-searching among Florida Democrats, who wondered whether the candidate might have done more to mobilize voters in liberal South Florida \u2014 or if, in his quest to energize the liberal base, he failed to connect with the broader, multiethnic coalition that had lifted Obama.\n\n\u201cWe were so close,\u201d said Florida Senate Minority Leader Audrey Gibson, whose district includes the north side of Jacksonville. \u201cWhat could we have done to drive out more votes? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what we could have done to make a difference.\u201d\n\nIt is also possible, Gibson said, that Gillum\u2019s candidacy had energized voters who were uneasy about having a black governor.\n\n\u201cThe coalition that does not vote by race, the one that elected Obama, is not falling apart, but the people who do vote by race is coming out,\u201d she said. \u201cI hate to say that, but that\u2019s what\u2019s happening in this country.\u201d\n\nEven before the polls closed Tuesday, there were small signs that Gillum was not reaching everyone.\n\nMaxwell knocked on the door of his next-door neighbor. He had been badgering the 18-year-old high school dropout to ride with him to the polls. The young man told Maxwell he did not have a state ID and had no intention of getting one.\n\n\u201cVoting doesn\u2019t change anything,\u201d he told Maxwell.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to get through to him,\u201d Maxwell said afterward.\n\nThe Gillum campaign planned to win Florida with a two-pronged strategy. It would harness the energy among black voters about the possibility of a historic election in the urban counties, while gathering support of nonvoters and conservatives who are uneasy with the negative tone and divisions in politics.\n\nOn the day before the election, Gillum\u2019s campaign bus skipped the liberal bastions in South Florida and rolled past the Old Country Store and Hickory Hill Auctions in rural Madison County, where Trump got 57 percent of the vote in 2016. Fifty-nine percent of county residents are white, according to census data, and 40 percent are black.\n\nAn overwhelmingly African American crowd of hundreds waited in a pavilion that evening to see Gillum. The local Democratic Party fired up the grill and made hamburgers. \u201cAn-Drew! An-Drew! An-Drew!\u201d voters shouted as their children climbed on a monument dedicated to Confederate soldiers.\n\n\u201cNo one ever thinks about coming to a place like this and asking us to vote,\u201d said Mary Ealy Stephens, 62, a registered nurse, who is black. \u201cSo it shows that he knows our lives matter.\u201d\n\nGillum barely mentioned possibly being the state\u2019s first black governor \u2014 the \u201cobvious history,\u201d he called it \u2014 and noted that one of his last stops in the campaign was before a memorial to those who fought in the Civil War on the side of states that owned slaves.\n\n\u201cHow poetic is that?\u201d he said.\n\nCourtney Cooper, 36, was the type of resident whom the Gillum campaign hoped to attract: an independent Trump voter who has grown concerned about the president\u2019s bullying tone.\n\nBut she ended up voting for DeSantis, partially because she wanted to see an end to racial divisions. In Cooper\u2019s eyes, tensions between races in Madison only worsened after Obama\u2019s election in 2008. Black neighbors just started seeing everything differently, she said. They seemed consumed with Obama as the first black president and less concerned about how he was affecting the economy in Florida.\n\n\u201cThat trickled down to everything,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cNow everyone is so worried about the other race.\u201d She said she felt that a vote for Gillum, who had accused DeSantis of using a racist slur after he warned Florida voters on TV not to \u201cmonkey up\u201d the state, would worsen those tensions.\n\nBack on the north side of Jacksonville, Bridget Waters and a friend sat outside Waters\u2019s home, where Waters said she was relieved that the voting was over.\n\n\u201cI threw out a garbage bag full of mail about the election,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople had been chasing me on my phone for weeks.\u201d\n\nThe hectoring worked: She voted in her first midterm election in more than a decade. She acknowledged that she didn\u2019t know much about Gillum but cited two major factors in her support for him.\n\n\u201cI knew he was black,\u201d she said. \u201cI also knew I didn\u2019t like Trump, and Republicans have to be stopped. They are trying to take away food stamps and my disability. How will I eat?\u201d\n\nAs Waters spoke, her friend, Ieisha Rogers, 40, fiddled on her cellphone.\n\n\u201cI stay out of politics,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cNothing ever changes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t vote, you can\u2019t complain,\u201d Waters said. \u201cThey say voting changes things.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t, anyway, because I\u2019m a felon,\u201d Rogers responded.\n\nWaters also then told her about the amendment to return voting rights to those with criminal records. Rogers put down her phone.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d she said. \u201cThat might change my mind.\u201d", "Matthew G. Whitaker, President Trump\u2019s pick to temporarily helm the Justice Department, provides Trump with the leader he has long sought at the law enforcement agency: a political loyalist critical of the special counsel probe.\n\nBefore Whitaker joined the Trump administration as a political appointee, the Republican lawyer and legal commentator complained that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the election and of the Trump campaign was dangerously close to overreaching. He suggested ways it could be stopped or curtailed and urged his followers on Twitter to read a story that dubbed the investigators \u201cMueller\u2019s lynch mob.\u201d\n\nNow \u2014 at least on an interim basis \u2014 Whitaker will assume authority over that investigation, an arrangement that has triggered calls by Democrats for him to recuse himself.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Whitaker said he was \u201ccommitted to leading a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans.\u201d\n\nBefore joining the Justice Department in 2017 as Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, Whitaker served as U.S. attorney in Iowa, made an unsuccessful U.S. Senate bid and ran a conservative watchdog group. For a time, he served on the advisory board of an invention-promotion company that was shut down earlier this year amid a Federal Trade Commission investigation, records show.\n\nFellow conservatives cast Whitaker\u2019s political background as an asset. \u201cThere\u2019s so many things that fall within the Justice Department\u2019s responsibility that lie at the intersection of law and politics that you really need to be knowledgeable and able to see the issue in both political and legal terms,\u201d said former deputy attorney general George J. Terwilliger III.\n\n[Sessions\u2019s ouster throws future of special counsel probe into question]\n\nAs Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, Whitaker met with the president in the Oval Office more than a dozen times, normally accompanying the attorney general, according to a senior administration official. When Trump complained about the Mueller investigation, Whitaker often smiled knowingly and nodded in assent, the official said.\n\nBefore joining the Justice Department, he made pointed comments suggesting Mueller\u2019s probe is too far-ranging. In a July 2017 appearance on CNN, Whitaker mused about a scenario in which Trump might fire Sessions and replace him with a temporary attorney general. Whitaker suggested the replacement could then choke off funding for the Mueller probe, and \u201chis investigation grinds to almost a halt.\u201d\n\nWhitaker also tweeted in August 2017 that his followers should read a Philadelphia Inquirer column titled \u201cNote to Trump\u2019s lawyer: Do not cooperate with Mueller lynch mob.\u201d\n\nIn an opinion column that month on CNN, he said any investigation of Trump\u2019s personal or business finances would be crossing a red line, and he urged Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein to \u201climit the scope of this investigation.\u201d\n\nWhitaker also has ties to a witness in the probe: onetime Trump campaign chairman Sam Clovis. The two men have been close since Whitaker chaired Clovis\u2019s bid for Iowa state treasurer in 2014.\n\nClovis has been interviewed as a witness in the Mueller investigation because of his communications with George Papadopoulos, a junior Trump campaign adviser who repeatedly tried to broker a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nClovis confirmed Wednesday that he met with Mueller\u2019s grand jury and is friends with Whitaker, but he sharply dismissed the suggestion that their relationship raised questions about Whitaker\u2019s ability to oversee the Russia probe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not relevant, and Matt has high integrity. I\u2019m very happy for him, and he\u2019ll do a fantastic job,\u201d Clovis said. \u201cHe\u2019s as fine a man as I\u2019ve ever gotten to know, a clearheaded conservative, and I wish him the best.\u201d\n\nWhitaker was nominated to be U.S. attorney in Iowa by President George W. Bush. He served in the post from 2004 until President Barack Obama took office in 2009.\n\nIn 2014, Whitaker ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate seat in Iowa previously held by Tom Harkin. At one candidate forum, Whitaker said he would support only federal judicial nominees who were \u201cpeople of faith\u201d and \u201chave a biblical view of justice.\u201d\n\nHe lost in the Republican primary to Joni Ernst, running fourth among the GOP candidates with 7.5 percent of the vote.\n\nAfter that loss, Whitaker joined the advisory board of an invention-promotion company called World Patent Marketing. The company was shut down earlier this year amid an FTC probe that accused it of being a sham group that cheated inventors by falsely promising them help with marketing their ideas in exchange for exorbitant fees. \u201cFor the last three years, Defendants have operated an invention-promotion scam that has bilked thousands of consumers out of millions of dollars,\u201d the agency alleged in a recently unsealed court filing. \u201cIn truth and in fact, Defendants fail to fulfill almost every promise they make to consumers.\u201d\n\nThe FTC case included an email Whitaker wrote on Aug. 21, 2015, to someone who had complained about the firm\u2019s conduct and threatened, among other things, to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Whitaker noted that he was a former U.S. attorney and accused the complainant of trying to smear the company. \u201cI am assuming you understand that there could be serious civil and criminal consequences for you,\u201d he wrote in the email, which was included in the federal district court filing in the matter.\n\nThe FTC did not accuse Whitaker or other board members of wrongdoing in its investigation, which resulted in a settlement. While agreeing to a financial penalty and a suspension of certain activities, the company did not formally acknowledge wrongdoing, documents show.\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on Whitaker\u2019s work history.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2017, Whitaker served as executive director of FACT, the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a conservative version of the ethics watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. He was paid handsomely, earning a $402,000 salary in 2016 for 40 hours of work a week, according to tax filings.\n\nIn his role at FACT, Whitaker asked then-Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate Sidney Blumenthal, a longtime adviser to the Clintons, for what he said were foreign lobbying disclosure violations. In his complaint, he cited news articles based on emails hacked from Blumenthal\u2019s account.\n\nIn response, Blumenthal wrote the Justice Department to say that Whitaker\u2019s complaint had no merit and was based on misrepresentations of emails that had been illegally hacked from Blumenthal\u2019s personal account.\n\nAlice Crites, Josh Dawsey and Rosalind S. Helderman contributed to this report.", "The biggest winner of this week\u2019s midterm elections, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, was greeted Wednesday with praise from her two most powerful political rivals.\n\n\u201cI give her a great deal of credit for what she\u2019s done, and what she\u2019s accomplished,\u201d Trump said at the White House, offering remarkable deference to the Democrat from California he had previously nicknamed \u201cHigh Tax, High Crime Nancy Pelosi\u201d and \u201cMS-13 lover Nancy Pelosi.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not unfamiliar with each other,\u201d added Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), praising her long service and legislative experience. \u201cWhen we do things together, it almost never makes any news.\u201d\n\nFor Pelosi, 78, it was the return to center stage that she has sought since losing her role as House speaker \u2014 the first female House speaker \u2014 after the Republican electoral wave of 2010. With Tuesday\u2019s Democratic takeover of the House, Pelosi, the most powerful elected woman in U.S. history and long the principal foil for Republicans, has every intent of becoming the first speaker since Sam Rayburn (D-Tex.) to hold the office more than once.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m the best person to go forward, to unify, to negotiate,\u201d she said at her own news conference at the U.S. Capitol. \u201cI\u2019m a good negotiator, as anyone can see.\u201d\n\nPelosi once had plans to retire with the election of the first female president. Those plans were quashed when Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\n\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) speaks with reporters Wednesday at the U.S. Capitol in Washington. She has high hopes to become House speaker again. (J. Lawler Duggan/For The Washington Post)\n\nNow, if she can surmount internal Democratic politics, Pelosi has the potential to reshape the Democratic Party and play a central role in the explosive expansion of power by women in politics, which led to significant Democratic gains among female voters in Tuesday\u2019s elections and an incoming House class that includes more than 100 women for the first time.\n\nShe will also be at odds with a president who gained office by insulting and belittling his female adversaries, often calling attention to their looks, and has been publicly accused by 13 women of touching them inappropriately.\n\nA return to the speakership would hand Pelosi the burden of chief Democratic strategist and the party\u2019s public face, at least until a 2020 presidential nominee emerges from the crowded nomination process. She would be tasked with focusing the policy priorities, and avoiding pitfalls, in such a way that positions the party to sweep Trump out of office.\n\n\u201cHe understands how effective she is,\u201d Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.), Pelosi\u2019s closest friend in Congress, said of Trump. \u201cHe said she\u2019s worked long, she\u2019s worked hard, she\u2019s worked smart, and I think that that\u2019s quite a compliment.\u201d\n\nPelosi made clear that she had every intention of working with Trump and preventing her own caucus from any \u201cscattershot freelancing\u201d as it ramps up investigations of the administration.\n\n\u201cIn terms of working with the president, I just would say that I worked very productively with President [George W.] Bush when we had the majority and he had the presidency,\u201d she said.\n\nBut first, she will have to maneuver inside her own caucus for the role.\n\nAs it stands, the raw arithmetic of the incoming Democratic majority remains an obstacle. An expected Democratic majority of 11 seats or thereabouts could give a small group of Democrats leverage to demand a shake-up of a leadership team that is distanced from the younger and more activist Democrats who will soon join the House.\n\nFour sitting Democrats voted against her in the last speaker election, and at least 12 of the incoming House Democrats made statements critical of Pelosi on the campaign trail, ranging from a general call for new leadership to a firm refusal to support her becoming speaker again. Seven more Democratic candidates in that category are running in races yet to be called.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be disrespectful to anyone who served, particularly a woman who\u2019s broken glass ceilings like Nancy Pelosi,\u201d said Elissa Slotkin, who dispatched Rep. Mike Bishop (R-Mich.) on Tuesday. \u201cBut we need to hear what people are telling us, and they\u2019re saying on both sides of the aisle they want a new generation of leadership.\u201d\n\nPelosi refused to directly address the palace intrigue in her news conference Wednesday, and her advisers are hopeful that it can be sorted out with a reshuffling of other leadership roles.\n\nIn a letter sent to members Wednesday night, Pelosi asked for their support and said she planned to speak to every House Democrat over the coming weeks \u201cto gather the best ideas on how to strengthen the institution we serve and to honor our responsibilities\u201d under the Constitution.\n\n\u201cMy vision for the next two years is to restore the House to the role it should have as a strong and independent voice for the American people,\u201d she wrote.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, she put her pitch more succinctly: \u201cIt is not about what you have done; it\u2019s about what you can do.\u201d\n\nBut it did not escape many that the issue most responsible for the Democratic takeover \u2014 the party\u2019s support for Obamacare and its protection of preexisting conditions \u2014 was only made possible because Pelosi forced the health-care legislation through during her first turn as speaker.\n\nHer performance this week suggests she is still very much campaigning for the job, which is likely to be decided behind closed doors at a Democratic caucus meeting later this month.\n\nPelosi raised $135.6 million in the 2018 cycle, and she traveled widely in the final weeks of the race \u2014 though mainly in more liberal-leaning districts. Democrats in swing districts and those that leaned Republican mostly kept her at arms\u2019 length.\n\nAs polls came in Tuesday night showing a sweeping Democratic House victory in the works, she declared \u201ca new day in America.\u201d She has spent considerable time since then looking beyond the leadership elections to her plans for working with Trump on issues such as drug prices and infrastructure.\n\n\u201cShe has basic rules that apply to her own role,\u201d said former congressman Steve Israel (D-N.Y.), a close ally who saw her last week at the wedding of a wealthy Democratic donor. \u201cFirst, you own the ground. You don\u2019t allow your opponents to fill in a narrative against you.\u201d\n\nThe other big rule, Israel continued, is to know how to count votes and bring together her caucus. The daughter of a congressman turned mayor of Baltimore, she still conducts herself with the formality of a bygone age, matching resolve with more mundane pleasantries.\n\nSince Trump\u2019s election, Pelosi has taken a firm but restrained approach to the president, frequently critiquing the damage of his policies and his departures from fact, without resorting to direct attacks.\n\nShe also has worked inside her party to keep political strategy focused on policy, not Trump\u2019s personality. On Wednesday, she told reporters that she has long urged fellow Democrats not to \u201ctake the bait\u201d and be lured into divisive immigration debates with Trump.\n\n\u201cFor all the diversity of opinions, she\u2019s the one that\u2019s held everyone together,\u201d Eshoo said.\n\nHer stature as a target of Republican disdain is unquestioned, as GOP pollsters have repeatedly found in her a useful shorthand for motivating conservatives and dissuading moderate independent voters from voting Democratic.\n\nIn August and September, about 7 percent of Republican television ads mentioned Pelosi, compared with 10 percent of Democratic ads that mentioned Trump, according to the Wesleyan Media Project, which has ranked Pelosi as the most mentioned congressional leader in campaign ads in every cycle since 2010.\n\n\u201cYou would have thought that Nancy Pelosi was on 100 different ballots across America the way that she was attacked by Republicans,\u201d said Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a young Pelosi ally. \u201cDespite that, we made big gains in the House, so the argument that she was a drag on candidates just does not hold.\u201d\n\nTrump rarely let a political event go by without name-checking her as one of several personifications of the threat of liberal rule. But he has also been more restrained in his attacks on her than some other rivals, usually choosing to speak her name without a derisive nickname. Early in his term, Trump met repeatedly with Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) \u2014 \u201cChuck and Nancy,\u201d the president called them \u2014 to try to strike deals, a strategy that dissolved after he went back to stirring his base by denouncing Democrats.\n\nThe president told reporters Wednesday that he would be willing to encourage Republicans to vote for her as speaker if she runs into trouble getting the roughly 218 votes she will need next year to be elected to the post.\n\n\u201cI think I would be very able to supply her the necessary votes,\u201d Trump said.\n\nPelosi has responded by calling Trump \u201cthe great organizer\u201d of her party, and continued to wear her gay pride Apple Watch band in the Oval Office, a rejoinder to the president\u2019s policies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m respectful of the office he holds,\u201d she told The Washington Post last year. \u201cOne of the things that I have tried to convey in our conversations is that we have to have evidence-based conversations \u2014 with facts.\u201d\n\nAt their first meeting at the White House, days after his inauguration, Trump began boasting about how he had won the popular vote in 2016 election, which he did not.\n\nPelosi decided to speak out of turn: \u201cMr. President, that\u2019s not true.\u201d", "The White House suspended the press credentials of CNN reporter Jim Acosta on Wednesday, hours after President Trump took issue with questions Acosta asked at a news conference.\n\nThe move to punish Acosta by removing his access to the White House is believed to be unprecedented. The Trump administration barred another CNN reporter from attending an open media event in July but until now has not gone as far as removing a credential, known as a \u201chard pass,\u201d which enables a journalist to enter the White House grounds.\n\nPress secretary Sarah Sanders cited Acosta\u2019s brief confrontation with a White House press aide during Trump\u2019s midday news conference as the reason for suspending his press pass \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d\n\nDuring the 90-minute session at the White House, Trump snapped at Acosta after the reporter asked whether the president had \u201cdemonized immigrants\u201d by calling a caravan of Central American migrants \u201can invasion.\u201d After a long and tense back-and-forth, a female White House intern tried to take the microphone from Acosta.\n\nAcosta held onto it and raised an arm to shield it, in the process making contact with the aide. \u201cPardon me, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said to her.\n\n[\u2018You\u2019re a very rude person.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s enough.\u2019 \u2018Sit down.\u2019 Trump\u2019s news conference turns hostile.]\n\nAfter their exchange, Trump told Acosta: \u201cCNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them. You are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn\u2019t be working for CNN. You\u2019re a very rude person. The way you treat Sarah Huckabee is horrible. And the way you treat other people are horrible. You shouldn\u2019t treat people that way.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday night, Sanders accused Acosta of \u201cplacing his hands on a young woman\u201d and said it was on those grounds that Acosta\u2019s press pass was being suspended.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump believes in a free press and expects and welcomes tough questions of him and his Administration,\u201d Sanders said in a statement. \u201cWe will, however, never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern. This conduct is absolutely unacceptable. It is also completely disrespectful to the reporter\u2019s colleagues not to allow them an opportunity to ask a question.\u201d\n\nVideo of the exchange showed otherwise. On Twitter, Acosta responded to the press secretary\u2019s statement with, simply: \u201cThis is a lie.\u201d\n\nThis is a lie. https://t.co/FastFfWych \u2014 Jim Acosta (@Acosta) November 8, 2018\n\nThe White House Correspondents' Association called the White House\u2019s reaction \u201cout of line to the purported offense\u201d and urged that Acosta\u2019s press pass be restored.\n\nAppearing on CNN on Wednesday evening, Acosta told host Anderson Cooper that he was \u201cjust trying to ask a question of the president.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI didn\u2019t put my hands on her or touch her, as the White House is alleging. I do think, Anderson, that this is a test for all of us. I think they\u2019re trying to shut us down. I think they\u2019re trying to send a message to my colleagues.\u201d\n\nAcosta said he learned that his access was denied from a text message he received on his phone.

(Matt Volz/AP)\n\nVoters in deeply red states elected some deeply conservative politicians in this week\u2019s midterm elections. But they also approved a litany of progressive ballot initiatives, from restoring felon voting rights to raising the minimum wage and expanding Medicaid.\n\nThe electoral dissonance underscored that the issues people vote on at the ballot box don\u2019t always align with the candidates they vote for. The outcomes also highlight the approach advocates took in trying to get the ballot measures passed \u2014 namely, by not associating them with either party.\n\n\u201cAmericans are far more generous than our politics suggest,\u201d said Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project, a three-year-old nonprofit organization that has used ballot measures to circumvent deadlocks in legislative and executive branches\u00ad of government. The group backed several minimum-wage and Medicaid-expansion measures that passed Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWhen we take partisan labels off of ideas,\u201d Schleifer said, \u201cAmericans want everyone to make a living wage and be able to go to the doctor when they got sick.

The Sunshine State\u2019s lifetime felon voting ban was the most restrictive in the nation, and Florida had the largest population of former convicts barred from the voting booth. In an instant, they have become a constituency roughly a 10th the size of the voting population.\n\nFaiz Shakir, national political director for the American Civil Liberties Union, said that the organization spent about $5.5 million to boost the amendment, first to help get it on the ballot and then with the campaign to pass it. That effort started with making sure conservatives could get behind what had begun as a liberal cause.\n\n\u201cWe worked to get conservatives on board early,\u201d Shakir said, including groups such as the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. \u201cAnd that outreach paid off.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU also worked behind the scenes to prevent the campaign from being associated with one party or one candidate. It successfully appealed to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), among other national political figures, not to weigh in on the measure while campaigning in Florida.\n\n\u201cThe message was, we\u2019d appreciate it if they didn\u2019t comment or take a hard stand,\u201d Shakir said. \u201cWe were looking at a hyper-tribal, partisan environment; if this were tied to a candidate or a party, I didn\u2019t think it would succeed.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, voters propelled the biggest expansion of Medicaid in heavily Republican states since the early years of the Affordable Care Act, with hundreds of thousands of poor and vulnerable residents standing to gain health coverage as a result of Tuesday\u2019s elections.\n\nVoters in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah approved ballot initiatives to include in their Medicaid programs adults with incomes of up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line. The results accomplish a broadening of the safety-net insurance that the states\u2019 legislatures had balked at for years.\n\nIn Maine, voters elected Democrat Janet Mills as governor, clearing the path for a Medicaid expansion that voters approved by referendum a year ago. The outgoing GOP governor, Paul LePage, has been an ardent foe of the expansion and had blocked it for a year, leading to a court battle.\n\nDemocrats generally have supported Medicaid expansion while Republicans have opposed it, in some cases vociferously, using it as a symbol of their opposition to President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health-care law.\n\nBut Republican opposition has softened over time, especially as polls have made clear the expansion is popular among voters. In Idaho, outgoing Gov. C.L. \u201cButch\u201d Otter (R) even endorsed the proposition late last month, arguing that the measure would extend health care to 62,000 people, garner $400 million in federal tax money and stabilize financially struggling rural hospitals.\n\nMedicare expansion campaigners led with stories of people who could benefit from access to health care \u2014 and suggested that expanding Medicaid could save states money. In Utah, campaigners emphasized that taxpayers were sending money to Washington and that other states were reaping the benefits.\n\n\u201cProp 3 brings home $800 million a year from Washington, D.C., and slows the rising costs of health care,\u201d said Ray Ward, a Republican legislator and doctor featured on some of Utah Decides\u2019s direct mail. \u201cProp 3 is good news for Utah taxpayers.\u201d\n\nIn two other Republican-led states, voters supported measures to raise the minimum wage, a test of the popularity of the proposal among GOP voters whose leaders have traditionally opposed the hikes as bad for business.\n\nArkansas voted to increase the state\u2019s current minimum wage of $8.50 an hour to $11 by Jan. 1, 2021 \u2014 a rapid escalation in one of the nation\u2019s poorest states that will result in a quarter of the state\u2019s workers getting a raise.\n\n\u201cPeople call Arkansas conservative, but it\u2019s more populist. People here are socially conservative, but not necessarily free market. The big support for Trump is an indication of that,\u201d said Jeremy Horpedahl, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Central Arkansas.\n\nMissouri voters approved a gradual increase of the state\u2019s $7.85 an hour minimum wage to $12 an hour over the next five years, which is expected to result in more than 675,000 workers getting a raise.\n\nThe wins are likely to embolden progressive activists to try to get minimum-wage increases on the ballot in 2020 in other conservative states in the South and Midwest.\n\nElsewhere, a law that allowed Louisiana juries to convict someone of a felony without a unanimous verdict will end, thanks to a new state amendment passed Tuesday.\n\nAmendment 2 will require unanimous verdicts for felony convictions in all crimes that take place after 2018. Before the new legislation, Louisiana and Oregon were the only states that allowed juries to send people to prison without a unanimous verdict.\n\n\u201cYou have fundamentally changed criminal justice in Louisiana,\u201d state Sen. J.P. Morrell, a New Orleans Democrat who sponsored the legislation, told supporters of the measures during a victory party Tuesday, according to Nola.com. He added, \u201cYou, now, ladies and gentlemen, have ended 138 years of Jim Crow.\u201d\n\nStill, progressive ballot measures didn\u2019t succeed across the board.\n\nVoters in Arizona, one of the nation\u2019s most sun-soaked states, handily shot down a measure that would have ramped up its shift toward generating electricity from renewables, particularly solar. Residents in oil- and gas-rich Colorado defeated a measure that would have required much larger setbacks for drilling sites on nonfederal land.\n\nEven in the solidly blue state of Washington, incomplete results looked grim for perhaps the most consequential climate-related ballot measure in the country this fall: a statewide initiative that would have imposed a first-in-the-nation fee on emissions of carbon dioxide, the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases that drive global warming.\n\nIn each of those states, opponents in the energy industry poured millions of dollars into opposing the measures, arguing that they would increase electric bills, cost jobs and harm the economy.\n\nRichard Newell, president of the nonpartisan think tank Resources for the Future drew a different conclusion. \u201cThe complexities and politics of the clean energy transition are best navigated through a legislative process, which has been the basis for virtually all significant state level climate and renewable energy policy,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nSchleifer, of the Fairness Project, said his group plans to keep pushing ballot initiatives such as Medicaid expansion and a higher minimum wage in other parts of the country going forward, no matter their political leanings.\n\n\u201cPeople in other states are watching what\u2019s happening,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a lot more of this activity in 2020.\u201d\n\nCleve R.

(Rich Pedroncelli/AP)\n\nThe Trump administration issued a pair of federal rules on Wednesday that allow some employers to deny insurance coverage of birth control on religious or moral grounds, plowing ahead despite a legal and ideological tempest.\n\nThe rules notch a deep exception to a federal requirement under the Obama-era interpretation of the Affordable Care Act that essential health benefits must include coverage of contraception at no charge to consumers.\n\nThe circumvention of this mandate, first proposed by Trump health officials a year ago, is part of the administration\u2019s alliance with social conservatives for whom \u201creligious liberty\u201d has become a central cause and who had objected to the contraceptive mandate.\n\nThe draft rules drew vehement protests from civil liberties and women\u2019s rights advocates, along with Democrats in Congress and in state attorneys general offices.\n\nTwo lawsuits by attorneys general prompted federal judges in California and Pennsylvania to grant nationwide injunctions against the proposals, while the administration has prevailed in another case. They now are all before appellate courts.\n\nThe administration issued its final versions of the rules, to take effect in slightly more than two months, while the legal disputes are playing out.\n\nIn a statement accompanying the rules\u2019 final version, Health and Human Services officials said on Wednesday that the Affordable Care Act does not contain a contraception requirement and that the law does \u201cnot require the government to violate religious or moral objections to providing or purchasing such coverage.\u201d\n\nOne rule is for religious objections and the other for nonreligious moral convictions. In their final form, they do not allow publicly traded companies or governments to claim such exemptions.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the branch of HHS that oversees much of the ACA, proposed a new rule on Wednesday that is similar in spirit, requiring a greater separation of billing in ACA health plans for the part of coverage relating to abortion services that cannot be paid for with federal money.\n\nHHS officials downplayed the impact of the contraceptive rules, as they did when first proposing the idea. They predicted that the exemptions will be invoked by \u201cno more than approximately 200 employers\u201d and affect the coverage of birth control for perhaps 6,400 women.\n\nBrigitte Amiri, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Reproductive Freedom Project, predicted, however, that the new policy \u201cis going to rob tens of thousands or possibly hundreds of thousands of women of their benefit that they\u2019re guaranteed by law.\u201d The ACLU has supported the two lawsuits challenging the rules.\n\nThe judges in both lawsuits found that the draft rules were defective because they did not allow properly for the public to comment on them. In the Pennsylvania case, U.S. District Judge Wendy Beetlestone said that the plaintiffs had a strong case because the proposed exceptions to birth control coverage were of \u201cremarkable breadth\u201d and contradicted the ACA.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump administration set to expand religious exemptions to birth control coverage\n\nTrump administration launches review of government-funded fetal tissue research", "FILE - In this Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018, file photo, navy personnel carry the remains of a victim of Lion Air jet that crashed into the sea at the Tanjung Priok Port in Jakarta, Indonesia.

(Tatan Syuflana, File/Associated Press)\n\nJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 A crucial sensor was replaced on a Lion Air jet the day before it plunged into the Java Sea, and that sensor replacement may have exacerbated other problems with the plane, Indonesian investigators said Wednesday.\n\nThat sensor, known as the \u201cangle of attack\u201d sensor, keeps track of the angle of the aircraft nose to help prevent the plane from stalling and diving.\n\nEarlier this week, Indonesian officials hinted that airspeed indicators played a role in the deadly Oct. 29 crash that killed all 189 people on board.\n\nThe jet\u2019s airspeed indicator malfunctioned on its last four flights, and that problem was related to the sensor issue, said Soerjanto Tjahjono, chairman of Indonesia\u2019s National Transportation Safety Committee, on Wednesday.\n\nLion Air\u2019s first two attempts to address the airspeed indicator problem didn\u2019t work, and for the Boeing 737 MAX 8 plane\u2019s second-to-last flight on Oct. 28, the angle of attack sensors were replaced, Tjahjono said.\n\nOn the Oct. 28 flight, from Bali to Jakarta, the pilot\u2019s and copilot\u2019s sensors disagreed. The 2-month-old plane went into a sudden dive minutes after takeoff, which the pilots were able to recover from. They decided to fly on to Jakarta at a lower-than-normal altitude.\n\nThe next day, during the deadly crash, the plane hit the water at very high speed just 13 minutes after takeoff from Jakarta. Its flight crew had requested permission to return to the airport several minutes after taking off.\n\n\u201cThe point is that after the AOA (sensor) is replaced, the problem is not solved but the problem might even increase. Is this fatal? NTSC (National Transportation Safety Committee) wants to explore this,\u201d he said.\n\nEven if an angle of attack sensor on a jet is faulty, there\u2019s generally a backup system in place for the critical component, and pilots are trained to handle a plane safely if those sensors fail, airline safety experts said.\n\nThere are audio signals and physical warnings that can alert the pilot to malfunctioning equipment or other dangers, said Todd Curtis, director of the Airsafe.com Foundation.\n\n\u201cThey should have been completely engaged in what was going on inside that cockpit, and any kind of warning that came up, they would have been wise to pay attention to it,\u201d Curtis said.\n\nInvestigators are likely focused on how a single sensor\u2019s failure resulted in a faulty command that didn\u2019t take into account information from a second sensor, said John Cox, CEO of Safety Operating Systems.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what the crew knew and didn\u2019t know yet,\u201d Cox said. \u201cWe will.\u201d\n\nBoeing, which manufactured the Lion Air plane, issues safety-related bulletins, and had previously circulated instructions about what flight crews should do if sensors fail.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s National Transportation Safety Committee said it had agreed with Boeing on procedures that the airplane manufacturer should distribute globally on how flight crews can deal with \u201cangle of attack\u201d sensor problems.\n\nBut a Boeing statement said a safety bulletin, sent to airlines on Tuesday, directs flight crews to existing guidelines on how they should respond to erroneous \u201cangle of attack\u201d data. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if it plans an update, though comments from Indonesian officials indicate they expect one.\n\nIndonesian investigators said their flight procedure recommendations to Boeing were based on how the flight crew responded to problems on the Bali-to-Jakarta flight.\n\n\u201cThe draft of what will be conveyed by Boeing this morning has been presented to us,\u201d said air accident investigator Nurcahyo Utomo.\n\n\u201cThere are some things that we ask for explanation and some that we ask to be removed, and there has been an agreement between the NTSC and Boeing to release a new procedure to all Boeing 737 MAX users in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s search and rescue agency on Wednesday extended the search effort for a second time, saying it will continue until Sunday. Body parts are still being recovered and searchers continue to hunt for the cockpit voice recorder.\n\nThe Lion Air crash is the worst airline disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people died on a Garuda flight near Medan. In December 2014, an AirAsia flight from Surabaya to Singapore plunged into the sea, killing all 162 on board.\n\nLion Air is one of Indonesia\u2019s youngest airlines but has grown rapidly, flying to dozens of domestic and international destinations.

(Maika Elan, File/Associated Press)\n\nHANOI, Vietnam \u2014 Vietnam and the United States have finished the cleanup of dioxin contamination at Danang airport caused by the transport and storage of the herbicide Agent Orange during the Vietnam War.\n\nThe 30 hectares (74 acres) of land cleansed of the toxic chemical were handed over to Vietnam at a ceremony Wednesday where Vice Defense Minister Nguyen Chi Vinh praised the U.S. government\u2019s involvement in the cleanup.\n\n\u201cIt is proof that we are opening a future of good cooperation between the governments of Vietnam and the United States,\u201d Vinh said. \u201cToday marks the day that Danang airport is no longer known as a dioxin hotspot, the day that Danang people can be assured that their health will not be destroyed by chemicals left over from the war.\u201d\n\nLarge amounts of Agent Orange, which contains dioxin, were stored at Danang airport during the war and sprayed by U.S. forces to defoliate the countryside and deny communist fighters jungle cover. Vietnamese still suffer from the effects of the spraying.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Daniel Kritenbrink called the joint cleanup a significant milestone in the expanding partnership between the two countries.\n\n\u201cThis project truly is a hallmark of our countries\u2019 shared vision to be honest about the past, deal responsibly with remaining legacy issues and turn a point of contention into one of collaboration,\u201d he said.\n\nKritenbrink said working together on the issues of the past \u201cbuilds strategic trust and enables us to further strengthen our forward-looking partnership that advances shared interests and strong people-to-people ties.\u201d\n\nBetween 1962 and 1971, the U.S. military sprayed roughly 11 million gallons of Agent Orange across large swaths of southern Vietnam. Dioxin stays in the soil and in the sediment at the bottom of lakes and rivers for generations. It can enter the food supply through the fat of fish and other animals.\n\nVietnam says as many as 4 million of its citizens were exposed to the herbicide and as many as 3 million have suffered illnesses caused by it \u2014 including the children of people who were exposed during the war.\n\nThe U.S. government says the actual number of people affected is much lower and that Vietnamese are too quick to blame Agent Orange for birth defects that can be caused by malnutrition or other factors.\n\nLast month, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited Bien Hoa air base north of Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, another dioxin hotspot.\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development will soon begin a soil restoration project at the base that is estimated to take several years and cost $390 million.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

For the first time, Trump will be forced to navigate divided government as Democrats who won the House pledge to be a check on his power and face pressure from their liberal base to block him at every turn.\n\nThe acrimony was punctuated by Trump\u2019s bombast, as the president refused to show contrition or take responsibility for his party\u2019s washout in many suburban areas where voters who previously backed Republicans rejected the president\u2019s hard-line politics.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), who is poised to lead the new Democratic majority as speaker, said her caucus would use its subpoena authority to pursue sweeping oversight of the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe will have a responsibility to honor our oversight responsibilities, and that\u2019s the path that we will go down,\u201d she told reporters. But, she added, Democrats would do so in the interest of \u201ctrying to unify our country.\u201d\n\n[Midterm elections: Democrats capture House as GOP holds Senate]\n\n\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) discussed areas of oversight she wants the majority to focus on in the House\u2019s new term. (J. Lawler Duggan/For The Washington Post)\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), whose party lost seats in the upper chamber, nonetheless cheered the House triumph and said, \u201cThere\u2019s now a check on Donald Trump, and that is great news for America.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of Tuesday\u2019s midterms, some allies said, Trump was both emboldened \u2014 because he believed he had helped expand the Republican majority in the Senate \u2014 and apprehensive, because he would no longer be able to bend all of Congress to his will.\n\nBut unlike his predecessors who acknowledged a \u201cshellacking\u201d (Barack Obama in 2010) or a \u201cthumpin\u2019\u201d (George W. Bush in 2006) after midterm losses, Trump spun his own reality by claiming \u201cvery close to complete victory.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a wide-ranging and often sharp-tongued news conference that any hope for bipartisan deals would evaporate if House Democrats use their new power to investigate him or his administration. Such efforts, he said bluntly, would precipitate \u201ca warlike posture.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats have said they plan to begin a series of investigations of the president, including issuing a subpoena for his tax returns, which he has for years refused to release. Trump said he would respond by using the Republican-controlled Senate as a cudgel, instructing his allies there to investigate alleged misconduct by Democrats.\n\n\u201cThey can play that game, but we can play it better, because we have a thing called the United States Senate,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey can look at us, then we can look at them and it\u2019ll go back and forth.

As the Senate leader told reporters, his top priority will continue to be confirming conservative nominees to federal courts, which Republicans have done at a record pace the last two years.\n\nTrump has told advisers that he intends to exploit divisions among House Democrats, according to a senior White House official. He believes he can pit Pelosi and others who are interested in making deals with him on policies like infrastructure spending against those who rose to office intent on blocking his agenda and, perhaps, beginning impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe president\u2019s allies argued that Democrats were overestimating their mandate from Tuesday\u2019s elections and will emerge as a useful political foil for Trump as he seeks reelection.\n\n\u201cI feel sorry for the Democrats because he\u2019s going to crush them,\u201d former Trump deputy campaign manager David N. Bossie said. \u201cThese people hate him more than they want to do their jobs, and that\u2019ll allow him to be reelected in 2020.\u201d\n\nTrump also has said privately that he does not believe his administration should necessarily cooperate with Democratic investigations, and that he would be willing to fight subpoenas to the Supreme Court if necessary, according to the senior White House official and an outside adviser to the president, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal discussions.\n\nTrump has been consulting White House lawyer Emmet Flood, who is overseeing the handling of the Russia investigation, and Flood has expressed interest in fighting back against incoming subpoenas, according to the outside adviser.\n\n[Sessions\u2019s ouster throws future of special counsel probe into question]\n\nBut Trump\u2019s confidence in his own ability to navigate the thicket of obstacles facing him will soon be tested, according to Republicans from past administrations who recall being humbled by congressional Democrats winning power. The deluge of legal scrutiny and congressional subpoenas risks overwhelming the president\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cOne of the things the White House needs to understand is that we doubled the size of the general counsel\u2019s office and that wasn\u2019t big enough,\u201d former top George W.

Pat A. Cipollone only recently took over from Donald McGahn as counsel and has a number of vacancies to fill. The adviser described the office as \u201cin desperate need\u201d of recruiting more attorneys. Many experienced lawyers at top Washington firms have long been reluctant to join the White House, both because they would have to take a pay cut and because of the chronic turmoil inside.\n\nDuring his remarkably combative news conference in the East Room of the White House on Wednesday, Trump repeatedly lost his cool as he answered questions from journalists for 86 minutes. He called CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta \u201ca rude, terrible person,\u201d snapped at Peter Alexander of NBC News and directed April Ryan of American Urban Radio to \u201csit down.\u201d And when Yamiche Alcindor of \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d asked the president whether by identifying as a \u201cnationalist\u201d he also was embracing the label \u201cwhite nationalist,\u201d he told her repeatedly, \u201cThat\u2019s such a racist question.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo say what you just said is so insulting to me,\u201d Trump responded to Alcindor, who is black.\n\nTrump also was cutting in his criticism of some House Republicans who lost reelection, singling them out by name and attributing their losses to their decisions to distance themselves from him.\n\n\u201cMia Love gave me no love, and she lost,\u201d Trump said, referring to the defeated Utah congresswoman who was the lone black Republican woman in the House. In a mocking tone, he continued, \u201cToo bad. Sorry about that, Mia.\u201d\n\nTrump also told reporters that he believes his chances of striking deals \u2014 such as to fund building projects, lower the prices of prescription drugs and refashion trade policies \u2014 would be greater with a divided Congress. He said he looked forward to working with Pelosi on \u201ca beautiful bipartisan-type situation.\u201d\n\n[Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigns at Trump\u2019s request]\n\nSen. Robert P.

People are pretty exhausted with the back and forth.\u201d\n\nRep.

Now everybody is in love.\u201d\n\nBut Trump drowned out his own call for unity within hours by announcing via Twitter the sudden ouster of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who said in his resignation letter that the president had directed him to resign.\n\nThe two parties plunged into a fierce disagreement over whether the president was obstructing justice by replacing Sessions with acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker, who immediately assumed control over special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The inquiry had previously been overseen by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein.\n\nDemocrats indicated that the firing of Sessions would be one of their top investigation targets \u2014 and warned of a constitutional crisis. Rep. Adam B.

Larry Hogan wins a second term in deep-blue Maryland]\n\nBut the same political realities that have helped burnish Hogan\u2019s reputation could be an obstacle to him accomplishing his goals at home.\n\nHogan must rely on Democratic state lawmakers to enact his vision of broad tax cuts, particularly for retirees, more school accountability and a nonpartisan redistricting process.\n\nThose Democrats, who have held a supermajority in the General Assembly for nearly 50 years, picked up a net gain of four seats Tuesday and plan to push for hefty school funding increases, more relief from rising health-care costs \u2014 and, possibly, legalizing recreational marijuana or enacting a $15 minimum wage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have an agenda as well,\u201d said state House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel).\n\nThe former executive director of the Maryland Republican Party was one of six GOP incumbents ousted from the General Assembly in Maryland\u2019s version of the blue wave. He laughed at the idea that Hogan could deliver big tax breaks in a second term.\n\n\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d said Del. Joe Cluster (Baltimore County). \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be able to do anything he wants to do.\u201d\n\nHogan also will have to grapple with the state\u2019s powerful unions, which have been waging a public and combative battle over contracts for government employees.\n\n[Hogan blames President Trump for downballot GOP losses in Maryland]\n\nMichael Steele, a former chair of the Republican National Committee who has been friends with Hogan for three decades, said the governor\u2019s resounding victory opens a place on the national stage \u201canywhere he wants to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe space is his to occupy,\u201d Steele said. \u201cI\u2019m sure those opportunities will present themselves to him, if he wants them.\u201d\n\nHogan, the son of a former congressman, said before the election that he doubts he would enjoy being a U.S. lawmaker. \u201cI like managing and running\u201d things, the governor said. \u201cBeing one of a bunch of legislators that just argue all day and make speeches, that doesn\u2019t thrill me at all.\u201d\n\nHe insists he does not harbor presidential ambitions, but in the face of public urging from some of his supporters has declined to rule out a potential run after his second term.\n\n\u201cWhen he got up to make his speech last night, people were shouting \u2018Hogan for President,\u2019 \u201d Kristen Burke, a stay-at-home mom from St. Mary\u2019s County said Wednesday morning. \u201cI\u2019d like to see that.\u201d\n\nAt a Hogan rally Saturday, when a man shouted \u201crun for president,\u201d the governor ignored the subsequent cheers except to shoot a disapproving look into the crowd.\n\nWatch Larry Hogan\u2019s facial expression when someone yells, \u201crun for president!\u201d pic.twitter.com/xlXDGw0mVa \u2014 Erin Cox (@ErinatThePost) November 3, 2018\n\nTo succeed on a national level, Hogan would have to find a way to appeal to more conservative-leaning voters, analysts said, and would probably need to follow the trajectory of other pragmatic Republican governors, such as Jeb Bush in Florida and Chris Christie in New Jersey, who moved right later in their tenure.\n\n\u201cHe would be in a more conservative arena,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if he has those ambitions, but he impresses a lot of people with his personal and political story.\u201d\n\nPat Lippold, political director for the SEIU 1199, said concerns about Hogan\u2019s future direction was a key reason the labor group backed Jealous in the election.\n\n\u201cA lot of people think that, it\u2019s not just me,\u201d she said. \u201cI would venture to guess that, much like Chris Christie in his second term, he will be tacking to the right.\u201d\n\nChristie, a Hogan friend and mentor, drew national attention as a popular moderate during his first term, but he then began promoting conservative policies \u2014 including overhauling Social Security and increased defense spending \u2014 as he was running for president.\n\nPatrick Moran, president of AFSCME Council 3 union, said shifting right would be the only way Hogan could appeal to the country\u2019s Republican base. \u201cThat means trying to stifle public services,\u201d Moran said.\n\n[Md. state employees demand more staffing, pay increases from Gov. Larry Hogan]\n\nHogan has remained popular in Maryland in large part because of pragmatism \u2014 his willingness to walk away from political fights he can\u2019t win and embrace Democratic ideas. He has repeatedly distanced himself from President Trump, whom he blamed Wednesday for downballot GOP losses in Maryland.\n\nHogan said he was able to withstand the Democratic backlash because he \u201cdidn\u2019t govern as a Republican. . . . I was a governor for all the people.\u201d\n\nHe has roundly dismissed the notion he plans to govern any differently, citing his high job approval ratings and polls that show most residents think the state is headed in the right direction.\n\n\u201cThere is going to be no change of direction,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cPeople seem to be happy with what we\u2019ve been doing, so I can\u2019t imagine why we would want to change.\u201d\n\n\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) speaks at an election night party in Annapolis, Md. (Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nHogan said governors from both sides of the aisle should step into the vacuum created by partisan gridlock in Washington. He said his victory could be a model for how Republicans can govern in the age of Trump.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question the Republican Party has to take a close look at itself,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cI think I\u2019ll be a part of that discussion about how we can move forward.\u201d\n\nWhile Hogan\u2019s political ascent in Maryland \u201cis one impressive feat,\u201d it may not provide a helpful road map elsewhere, said Kyle Kondik, who analyzes races for the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. Like the two other popular Republican governors in Democratic states \u2014 Charlie Baker in Massachusetts and Phil Scott in Vermont \u2014 Hogan is not a \u201cculture warrior,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt almost feels like they\u2019re part of a different party than Trump and the rest of the Republicans,\u201d Kondik said. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily an avenue to becoming a presidential candidate, because you sort of need to be a cultural warrior\u201d right now.\n\n[Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s \u2018regular guy\u2019 approach smooths over partisan edges]\n\nAt his January swearing-in, Hogan will be greeted by a markedly more liberal legislature, increasing the pressure on him to govern from the middle.\n\n\u201cCertainly the House and I think maybe the Senate has moved more to the left,\u201d said House Appropriations Chair Del. Maggie L. McIntosh (D-Baltimore City). \u201cAnd the governor who tries to call himself a centrist is going to have to work with it.\u201d\n\nSenate President Thomas V. Mike Miller (D-Calvert) said he hopes the governor\u2019s lame-duck status reduces partisan drama.\n\n\u201cWe just expect him to live up to his campaign promise that he\u2019s going to work across the aisle and govern from the middle,\u201d Miller said. \u201cHe reads tea leaves. He does polling. He knows that people want their government to work.\u201d\n\nSteele, who served one term as Maryland\u2019s lieutenant governor before leading the RNC, said Hogan has plenty of time to decide his plans. He said it\u2019s Hogan\u2019s approach \u2014 not necessarily his policy positions \u2014 that make him appealing.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, he didn\u2019t come in there with a philosophical agenda. It doesn\u2019t mean that he didn\u2019t have a philosophy, just that he was willing to listen to people and meet them where they were,\u201d Steele said. \u201cWhen you lead with your own drum, making your own noise, it means you\u2019re not hearing what the people are saying. They\u2019re more often than not getting it right.\u201d\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified Del.

Central American migrants on Wednesday continued to straggle in for a rest stop at a Mexico City stadium, where about 4,500 continue to weigh offers to stay in Mexico against the desire of many to reach the U.S. border. (Rodrigo Abd/Associated Press)\n\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 The migrants in a caravan used by President Donald Trump as a campaign issue were almost universally unaware of the results of the U.S. midterm elections.\n\nThe Central Americans were more concerned with the dangers of northern Mexico as they struggled to reach the U.S. border, still hundreds of miles away, than with who controls the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nKenia Johana Hernandez, a 26-year Honduran farmworker, left her country with her 2-year-old daughter because she couldn\u2019t afford child care or schooling. Asked if her decision to emigrate had anything to do with the U.S. elections, the answer was a simple, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nFor her, the caravan was merely a safety measure. \u201cIf I had come alone with just my daughter, maybe I wouldn\u2019t have even made it this far because it is so dangerous,\u201d she said.\n\nGilberta Raula, 38, from Samala, Guatemala, joined the caravan at the Mexican border because it seemed her best chance to get her 15-year-old daughter out of the country. She left six other children behind, but wants to give her daughter an opportunity to study and work.\n\nShe had only the vaguest idea of the issues surrounding Tuesday\u2019s U.S. midterms.\n\nWhat she did know, she said, was that \u201cthe U.S. president has acted badly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way we hear it, he doesn\u2019t like anybody,\u201d she said of Trump. Told that Trump\u2019s Republican party had lost control of the U.S. House of Representatives she said, \u201cAh, good.\u201d She, like others, expressed hope that somehow it might help their chances of finding refuge.\n\nFranklin Martinez, a 46-year-old farmworker from La Esperanza, Honduras, said Wednesday he\u2019d probably stay in Mexico City for a while before setting off again northward, to see if things changed following the U.S. elections.\n\n\u201cBecause now it\u2019s an anti-immigrant wave,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThey\u2019re not well-received at the border.\u201d\n\nExperts agree that the formation of this latest caravan and the others that have set off for the U.S. border before it have far more to do with politics in Central America and current conditions in Mexico, where drug gangs frequently kidnap migrants to demand ransom from their families in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe first concern is collective security, there is safety in numbers,\u201d said Mexican security analyst Alejandro Hope. \u201cThere is a political logic to this, but it\u2019s not exactly aimed at influencing the U.S. elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt brings pressure on the authorities of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador more than anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cThis sends a message that there is a human rights crisis in the Northern Triangle of Central America.\u201d\n\nThat view was shared by former Honduran lawmaker Bartolo Fuentes, who helped formed the caravan of just a few hundred migrants that set out from Honduras on Oct. 13, before growing to as many as 7,000 at its peak. Fuentes told a news conference at the Mexico City stadium where the migrants are staying that the caravan embarrasses the Honduran government \u201cbecause now the world is seeing the tragedy we live with.\u201d\n\nRaul Benitez, a security expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said the Republican losses in the House suggest that Trump tried to use the migrants \u201cpolitically, to depict the caravan as an invasion, and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nBenitez said the caravan has put as much pressure on Mexico as the United States. After the migrants entered, Mexico came under pressure to accelerate the refugee and asylum process for Central Americans.\n\n\u201cThe caravan shows that Mexico could give more humanitarian treatment to these people,\u201d said Benitez, \u201cthat Mexico should treat these people the way Mexico wants the U.S. to treat migrants.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Christopher Gascon, the Mexico representative for the International Organization for Migration, estimated there were about 6,000 migrants at the sports complex and maybe another 4,000 in caravans that are working their way through southern Mexico.\n\nBut some migrants had been visiting the organization\u2019s tent asking about how they can return home.\n\n\u201cThey perhaps didn\u2019t have a very clear idea of what they faced,\u201d Gascon said. He said the first bus leaving Mexico City to take migrants back to their countries was scheduled to depart Wednesday night with 40 to 50 people.\n\nMeanwhile, other migrants were focusing on the daunting task of reaching the U.S. border and presenting asylum requests there. The U.S. elections occupied only a small part of their thoughts.\n\nNora Torres, a 53-year-old Honduran, anxiously asked a reporter: \u201cHow did he (Trump) do? Did he do well or poorly?\u201d\n\nTorres had run a small restaurant but closed it because gangs were demanding too much protection money.\n\nFor her, Trump\u2019s threats to make attaining asylum even more difficult, of detaining applicants in tent cities and of sending as many as 15,000 U.S. troops to the southern border were hard to understand.\n\n\u201cThe United States needs Hispanic labor, because it is cheaper,\u201d she said. \u201cSo why do they discriminate against us?\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Rui Vieira/Associated Press)\n\nMANCHESTER, England \u2014 Raheem Sterling went from the farcical to the sublime in helping Manchester City to a 6-0 win over Shakhtar Donetsk and the brink of qualifying for the Champions League knockout stage on Wednesday.\n\nThe England winger provided the main talking point in another convincing victory for City when he stubbed his toe in the turf as he attempted a shot in the 24th minute and toppled over. Referee Viktor Kassai awarded a penalty despite there being no contact with a defender \u2014 much to the amazement of Shakhtar\u2019s players, some of whom even laughed at the decision \u2014 and Gabriel Jesus converted the spot kick for 2-0 and the first of his three goals on the night.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like to score a goal in that situation,\u201d City manager Pep Guardiola said. \u201cIt was really clear.\u201d\n\nSterling showed much more poise in scoring City\u2019s third goal, by picking up the ball 40 meters out, powering through two would-be tacklers and curling a fierce shot into the top corner from the edge of the area in the 48th. It was the run and finish of a man in form, with Sterling having scored twice in the Premier League this past weekend as well.\n\nJesus made it 4-0 in the 72nd, again from the penalty spot after David Silva was tripped by Taras Stepanenko, before Riyad Mahrez and Jesus \u2014 with a goal that completed his hat trick \u2014 wrapped up the scoring. Silva had put City 1-0 ahead with a close-range finish in the 13th.\n\nCity stayed in first place in Group F, but moved three points ahead of Lyon after the French club drew 2-2 against Hoffenheim. The English champions need one more point from their last two games to be certain of a top-two finish.\n\nAfter City\u2019s latest attacking masterclass, it was the penalty decision \u2014 given by a referee who has officiated in a Champions League final and in World Cups \u2014 that will best be remembered. It led to Sterling trending worldwide on social media.\n\nIt was so obvious that Sterling tripped himself over, rather than being fouled by chasing Shakhtar defender Mykola Matvyenko, that Guardiola covered his face with his hands after the incident before wagging his finger toward his own bench , indicating the penalty should not have been awarded. Sergio Aguero, a substitute sitting just in front of Guardiola, had a smile on his face.\n\nThe official behind the goal \u2014 used in UEFA-run competitions instead of a video assistant referee \u2014 appeared to have a good view of the trip but somehow didn\u2019t spot it.\n\n\u201cThe referees, I said a long time ago, must be helped,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cThey want to make a good performance, they don\u2019t want to make mistakes. But today the game is quick, fast; the players are more skilled.\n\n\u201cIt takes three seconds, four seconds, 10 seconds, for someone involved to say it\u2019s no penalty, carry on.\u201d\n\nSterling looked slightly sheepish as he walked away from the spot where he fell, and didn\u2019t tell the referee there had been no contact from an opponent.\n\nAsked if Sterling could have owned up, Guardiola said \u201che could do that, yes\u201d before pointing to a goal City had wrongly disallowed in the second leg of last season\u2019s quarterfinal against Liverpool.\n\nCity has scored 23 goals in its last six games in all competitions, heading into a derby against Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Nearly all the migrants at the terminal said the same thing: Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but they intend to try again. (Moises Castillo/Associated Press)\n\nSAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras \u2014 The Metropolitan Grand Central bus terminal in this city where the migrant caravan traveling through Mexico originated more than three weeks ago is a place of crossing destinies for Hondurans dreaming of seeking a better life in the United States.\n\nSome of the dozens of people sleeping on the concrete floor or outside on the grass underneath palm trees bathed by the light of street lamps are awaiting buses to the Guatemalan border to begin the journey north. Others are arriving after failing to complete the trip and are being ferried back to the precarious lives they left behind.\n\nHundreds of the mostly Honduran migrants who set out with the caravan that has traversed hundreds of miles through three countries before arriving in Mexico City this week have returned home, according to the Mexican government. Some grew disillusioned. Others simply wore out. Still others were detained and returned, or gave up on waiting for possible asylum in Mexico and accepted bus rides back home.\n\nDisembarking at the bus station in San Pedro Sula, nearly all of those returning said the same thing: Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but they intend to try again.\n\n\u201cI would go 30 times more if possible,\u201d said Daniel Castaneda, an 18-year-old from the central city of Comayagua. He was detained shortly after migrants in a caravan following in the footsteps of the first one clashed with police on a bridge on the Mexican border with Guatemala late last month.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say when, but I am going to keep going. ... This country is going to be left empty,\u201d he said.\n\nReny Maudiel a fresh-faced 16-year-old in a green T-shirt, a mop of curly hair sticking skyward from his head, said he was turned off by the violence of last month\u2019s border clashes. He was also exhausted, and his feet hurt \u2014 but already his mind was turning northward.\n\n\u201cI hope another opportunity emerges,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile U.S. President Donald Trump seized on the caravan as a campaign issue for Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections and suggested that criminals had infiltrated the group, the migrants say they are fleeing poverty, lack of jobs and rampant violence.\n\nIn a country that is one of the world\u2019s deadliest by homicide rates, San Pedro Sula is among the most violent cities as the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13 street gang, fights street-by-street with the rival 18th Street gang for territory. It\u2019s also seen a harsh crackdown by security forces including documented abuses. Nationwide nearly two-thirds of Hondurans, or some 5.5 million people, live in poverty, according to the World Bank.\n\nPablo Alba choked up thinking about how his 11-year-old son wrapped his arms around his neck and begged to be taken on the journey north. Alba said no, not wanting the boy to risk the arduous trek.\n\n\u201cIf there must be suffering, I will go alone,\u201d he said, recalling that Oct. 13 day when he set off to join the caravan with only the clothes on his back.\n\nThe 64-year-old had never thought about emigrating before because he had always been able to find work. A trained veterinarian, he ended up selling tamales cooked by his landlady, and it wasn\u2019t nearly enough to support his family.\n\nMexican authorities say some 3,230 migrants from the caravan have requested refuge. Alba used to be one of them. But shut in at an immigration center and unable to communicate with his children \u2014 he had no money or cell phone \u2014 he dropped his application and agreed to return to Honduras. Some 480 others have done the same, according to the Mexican government.\n\nHe intends to try again in March \u2014 only this time he will bring his kids.\n\nAccording to data from Mexico\u2019s National Immigration Institute, on average 136 Honduran migrants per day have been returned to their country this year. Women and children are taken directly to a shelter in San Pedro Sula. Men go by bus to the Caribbean coastal city of Omoa, and from there are transferred to the San Pedro terminal.\n\nSome days they\u2019re met at the bus station by government officials sitting behind a plastic table offering \u201csolidarity bags\u201d of basic goods such as rice and dried spaghetti, along with a photo of President Juan Orlando Hernandez and a note saying it comes from his government.\n\nJorge Marquez said they were taking returnees\u2019 information to \u201cfollow up with them\u201d and allow them to benefit from aid that Hernandez has promised in response to the caravan, which at its peak numbered more than 7,000 people.\n\nBut such vows largely ring hollow in this deeply troubled and politically unstable country. In interviews with The Associated Press, most returnees said they faced only a bleak future if they remained in Honduras.\n\nHowever, some, like Gerardo Castillo, a 35-year-old mason, did find encouragement in promises by Mexico\u2019s President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office Dec. 1, to give special visas to Central Americans to work in his country.\n\nCastillo, who left two children back home in Olancho and has two more in the United States, complained that immigration agents under the current Mexican administration were detaining migrants who separated from the main caravan, as happened to him. In Lopez Obrador, he sees a possible future in Mexico.\n\n\u201cOn Dec. 1, I will be in Tecun Uman,\u201d Castillo said, referring to the Guatemalan city across the river border from Mexico.\n\nOlvin Fernando Murillo, 20, made it almost 200 miles (300 kilometers) north of that crossing to the town of Arriaga \u2014 still far from Phoenix, Arizona, where a brother lives.\n\nThat\u2019s when his 16-year-old girlfriend got sick. When it became clear she wasn\u2019t getting better they decided to return to their Honduran hometown of El Paraiso on the border with Nicaragua.\n\nHe sold his cellphone to raise a bit of money and had little more than a donated green backpack he picked up after crossing into Mexico.\n\nBut his plans were clear. \u201cTo rest for a while, and in January, another caravan,\u201d he said.\n\nRumors that yet more caravans will form are flying in every corner of Honduras. They\u2019re attractive for the perception that they provide safety in numbers, and because they\u2019re a way to avoid paying thousands of dollars to a smuggler.\n\nBut the reality is far less certain.\n\nThose few who make it to the United States face a tough road to be able to stay legally; poverty and violence are not supposed to be considered as qualifying factors for asylum. Trump has talked of making asylum even more difficult, of detaining applicants in tent cities and of sending 15,000 U.S. troops to the southern border.\n\nStill, 27-year-old Claudia Noriega was determined to risk it, saying she can no longer make a living selling sweets since sugar prices have soared. She was aware she could end up back here in a few weeks\u2019 time, just like the men sleeping on the bus terminal floor.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is to try,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you can\u2019t, you\u2019ll have to see what to do then.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

To get Colby Itkowitz\u2019s analysis of the biggest stories in politics in a format you can read in five minutes in your inbox on Monday, Wednesday and Friday afternoons, sign up here.\n\nHappy first day of the 2020 election!\n\nOkay, just kidding. Hopefully we\u2019ll at least get through the holidays before the Democrats start making the rounds to pancake breakfasts in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nBut even if we have a brief reprieve from campaigning, it\u2019s impossible not to immediately see the results of last night\u2019s midterms through the lens of 2020. How can Democrats beat Donald Trump if they couldn\u2019t sweep the country when he wasn\u2019t on the ticket? Meanwhile, can Trump project the same bravado with House Democrats nipping at his heels? We already witnessed today how quickly his Kumbaya facade crumbled at the mere possibility of the House Democrats launching their own investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump speaks to CNN journalist Jim Acosta during a news conference. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\n\u201cIf they do that, then it\u2019s just \u2014 all it is, is a warlike posture,\u201d he said during a post-election news conference.\n\nWhich brings us to the biggest news of today: Because news cycles are dizzying, it isn\u2019t directly about the midterms results, but about what resulted from the midterms.\n\nI had planned to dig into how the Democrats' wins and losses set up the map for 2020 and why, despite some big marquee losses like Beto O\u2019Rourke in Texas, there is plenty in the numbers to give Democrats a path to victory in two years. But that will have to wait for another day. (Probably Friday!)\n\nBecause around 2:45 p.m. it was announced that Trump had forced Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign and put in his place an acting attorney general who had once mused, on national television, about how to choke off the Mueller investigation. Matt Whitaker is highly likely to take over the Mueller investigation from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was only overseeing it because Sessions had recused himself.\n\nSo what does that mean practically for the investigation? My colleague Philip Bump explored that question earlier this year with Louis Seidman, professor of constitutional law at Georgetown University. As Seidman described it, the person overseeing the investigation (probably now Whitaker) could force Mueller to provide an explanation at every step and could reject new indictments.\n\nMoreover, Seidman said, \u201cDepending on how aggressive this person wanted to be, they could dismiss the criminal cases, they could get rid of the grand jury. In the end, if Trump is determined, the people he appoints could shut [the probe] down.\u201d\n\nThe man who would be overseeing the Mueller investigation is the same one who tweeted this:\n\nWorth a read. \"Note to Trump's lawyer: Do not cooperate with Mueller lynch mob\" https://t.co/a1YY9H94Ma via @phillydotcom \u2014 Matt Whitaker \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@MattWhitaker46) August 7, 2017\n\nImmediately after news broke the Democrats began drawing their battle lines, setting up an ugly showdown over Mueller for the lame-duck Congress and into next year.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters, \u201cI\u2019d say this, protecting Mueller and his investigation is paramount. It would create a constitutional crisis if this were a prelude to ending or greatly limiting the Mueller investigation, and I hope President Trump and those he listens to will refrain from that.\u201d\n\nHe then tweeted that Whitaker should recuse himself like Sessions did.\n\nGiven his previous comments advocating defunding and imposing limitations on the Mueller investigation, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself from its oversight for the duration of his time as acting attorney general. \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) November 7, 2018\n\nIn April, senators passed bipartisan legislation out of the Judiciary Committee giving Mueller some protections if anyone in the Justice Department wanted to fire him. But Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) refused to bring it to the floor, saying it wasn\u2019t \u201cnecessary.\u201d It\u2019s not out of the question that the House Democratic majority take up a similar bill next year.\n\nBut, back to the midterms: I saw a lot of Democrats on social media despair that the midterms didn\u2019t feel like the repudiation of Trump that they dreamed of two years ago. But, as my colleague Matt Viser tweeted, the value for Democrats of their taking the House is in moments like these.\n\nThis, from an incoming chairman who will soon have subpoena power, is the tangible impact of Democrats gaining control of the House: https://t.co/EYusbBFsW4 \u2014 Matt Viser (@mviser) November 7, 2018\n\nAnd then this from the congressman likely to assume the chairmanship of the Intelligence Committee.\n\nPresident Trump just removed Jeff Sessions. He wants an Attorney General to serve his interest, not the public.\n\n\n\nMueller's investigation and the independence of the DOJ must be protected. Whitaker and any nominee must commit to doing both.\n\n\n\nWe will protect the rule of law. \u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) November 7, 2018\n\nThere was a brief moment of conciliatory well-wishes last night, but going forward, Democrats are revved up for a fight, and Trump just gave them one.\n\nDear readers: We\u2019ll circle back to a midterms postmortem on Friday (barring any other huge news that drops). The Fix team participated in a Reddit AMA session today where we got to delve into a lot of great questions, like:\n\nI want to know what you are curious about after last night. Please send me your questions and I\u2019ll answer a few in Friday\u2019s newsletter.", "The news that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had resigned Wednesday at President Trump\u2019s request unnerved congressional Democrats, who immediately called for Sessions\u2019s successor to recuse himself from oversight of the Russia investigation being led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, largely avoided any mention of the Mueller probe in their statements on Sessions\u2019s departure, with several saying they were looking forward to working with Trump to find a long-term successor to the attorney general. Sessions will be succeeded on a temporary basis by his chief of staff, Matthew G. Whitaker.\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) issued the closest thing to a warning from the Republican side, saying that the Senate will not confirm a successor to Sessions who would stop the Russia investigation.\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement came just hours after Trump threatened at a news conference to retaliate with a \u201cwarlike posture\u201d against Democrats should they try to investigate him in the wake of their House victory on Tuesday. It also came after Republicans bolstered their ranks in the Senate with several new members who are ardent supporters of the president.\n\nSome Democrats, such as Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), warned that any move by Trump to limit the Mueller probe would trigger a \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur paramount view is that any attorney general, whether this one or another one, should not be able to interfere with the Mueller investigation in any way,\u201d Schumer said at a Capitol Hill news conference.\n\nThe New York Democrat was caught off guard by Sessions\u2019s resignation, learning of the news when an aide passed him a note at the start of his post-election news conference. He later said in a tweet that Whitaker should recuse himself given his previous comments about the probe.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Whitaker wrote an op-ed for USA Today saying that, contrary to suggestions by then-FBI Director James B. Comey, a reasonable prosecutor would have opted to prosecute Hillary Clinton for violations of email protocol. Despite publicly offering his views on this matter and on Mueller\u2019s activities, ethics experts suggest that he would not be required to recuse himself from Mueller-related decisions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no legal conflict,\u201d said ethics expert Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University School of Law. \u201cIf he were a judge, the public comment could require recusal because it would create a question about his impartiality in ruling. But as acting AG, he\u2019s a policymaker and is expected to have a policy position on how DOJ should deploy its resources and define the scope of Mueller\u2019s work, just as Rosenstein has been doing.\u201d\n\nThe GOP padded its slim 51-to-49 Senate majority on Tuesday, flipping Democratic-held seats in Missouri, Indiana and North Dakota, and three outstanding races are leaning toward Republicans. Asked whether the loss of Democratic seats makes it more difficult for the party to block an attorney general nominee it deems inappropriate, Schumer said the rules of the upper chamber already only require a simple majority, so it made no difference.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a tweet that it was \u201cimpossible to read Attorney General Sessions\u2019 firing as anything other than another blatant attempt by @realDonaldTrump to undermine & end Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation.\u2019\u2019\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a tweet that the country needs answers as to the reasons behind Sessions\u2019s removal.\n\n\u201cWhy is the President making this change and who has authority over Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation? We will be holding people accountable,\u201d Nadler asked.\n\nOther Democrats focused specifically on Whitaker, with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, calling it \u201ca break the glass moment.\u201d\n\nBlumenthal was among several Democrats and a handful of Republicans who pushed for Congress to pass a bill protect a special counsel from indiscriminate firing, by giving that counsel the ability to swiftly appeal that decision in the courts. But momentum around the bill flagged over the several months since it was introduced \u2014 and even the Republican co-sponsors of the legislation declared last month that there was no need to pass the measure to constrain the president.\n\n\u201cReplacing the Attorney General with a non-Senate-confirmed political staffer is highly irregular and unacceptable,\u201d Blumenthal said in a statement, urging Republicans to join Democrats in demanding that Whitaker recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller probe. He also said he would introduce new legislation to \u201censure that Congress and the American people see the results of Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nDemocrats had closed ranks around Sessions because of one thing: his voluntary recusal from all matters pertaining to the 2016 campaigns, and, by extension, Mueller\u2019s probe. That meant oversight of the probe fell to Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein.\n\nAny replacement for Sessions, however, would resume authority over the probe, and Whitaker has criticized its scope in the past. Democrats fear that even if he does not shut it down, he could hamstring the special counsel as Mueller seeks to advance his investigation.\n\n[The new acting attorney general once mused about defunding Robert Mueller]\n\nAmong Republicans, only a few raised the issue of the probe, with Alexander suggesting that the Senate would move to block any nominee who seeks to end it.\n\n\u201cThe one thing this does make certain is that the Mueller investigation into Russian meddling in elections will continue to its end, as it should, because no new Attorney General can be confirmed who will stop that investigation,\u201d Alexander said in a tweet.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Sen.-elect Mitt Romney (R-Utah) also said on Twitter that it is \u201cimperative\u201d that the Trump administration allow Mueller to finish his investigation without interference.\n\nIt is imperative that the Administration not impede the Mueller investigation. I\u2019m concerned Rod Rosenstein will no longer be overseeing the probe. Special Counsel Mueller must be allowed to complete his work without interference\u2014regardless of who is AG. \u2014 Sen. Susan Collins (@SenatorCollins) November 7, 2018\n\nMany Republicans had previously voiced opposition to the idea of Trump removing Sessions and were angered by the president\u2019s persistent public attacks on one of their former Senate colleagues. But on Wednesday, they were noticeably less critical.\n\nLast year, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) had declared himself \u201c100 percent\u201d behind Sessions and warned that \u201cthere will be holy hell to pay\u201d if Trump fired his attorney general.\n\nOn Wednesday, Graham, who has transformed into one of Trump\u2019s strongest defenders in recent months, gave his blessing to the president\u2019s move.\n\nGraham\u2019s name has been floated around the halls of Congress as a potential replacement for Sessions \u2014 but he hinted strongly in his comments that he planned to stay in the Senate and not put his hand up for the attorney general job.\n\n\u201cI look forward to working with President @realDonaldTrump to find a confirmable, worthy successor so that we can start a new chapter at the Department of Justice and deal with both the opportunities and challenges our nation faces,\u201d Graham said in a tweet.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) struck a similar note, thanking Sessions for his service and saying that he looks \u201cforward to working with him in any future endeavors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThroughout his career, as a prosecutor, a senator and as attorney general, he remained steadfast in his commitment to the rule of law and his love of our great nation,\u201d McConnell said, making no mention of the Russia investigation.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) once warned Trump that if he fired Sessions, there was \u201cno way\u201d he would hold a hearing to approve his replacement.\n\nBut Grassley softened on that conviction this year, saying that he would be \u201cwilling to work with the president on any nominee he sends up here to the Senate,\u201d Grassley spokesman George Hartmann said. On Wednesday, Grassley thanked Sessions in a tweet and made no mention of the search for his successor.\n\nSen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) expressed the hope that Trump selects a candidate who backs efforts to overhaul the criminal justice system. Sessions has been resistant to the effort.\n\n\u201cI want to thank Jeff Sessions for his service to our nation,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI am hopeful that President Trump will take this opportunity to nominate a replacement that is invested in criminal justice reform.\u201d\n\nAmong those criticizing Trump\u2019s move on Wednesday was former attorney general Eric Holder, who drew a direct line between Sessions\u2019s removal and the Mueller probe.\n\n\u201cAnyone who attempts to interfere with or obstruct the Mueller inquiry must be held accountable,\u201d Holder said in a tweet. \u201cThis is a red line. We are a nation of laws and norms not subject to the self interested actions of one man.\u201d\n\nTom Hamburger, Gabriel Pogrund, Paul Kane and Mike DeBonis contributed to this report.", "", "\n\nOffensive lineman Ellis McKennie, with flag, and Maryland teammates honor Jordan McNair before last weekend's game against Michigan State. (Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post)\n\nAs the months-long controversy surrounding the Maryland football program swelled last week, the situation remained one the players could only endure rather than control. Some spoke out, but the ultimate decision-making power rested much higher.\n\nThis week, as the Terrapins prepare for a road game against Indiana, they at least have a sense of normalcy.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve handled it in the best way we possibly can,\u201d senior defensive end Jesse Aniebonam said Tuesday, the first time players had been made available to members of the media since before DJ Durkin was reinstated as the team\u2019s coach Oct. 30, then fired a day later. \u201c . . . What a lot of the younger guys have to understand is when things like this happen, it\u2019s on us to really show our maturity and show our resolve in order to progress through the season with all the turmoil.\u201d\n\n[Maryland fires athletic trainers who had been on leave in wake of Jordan McNair's death]\n\nSome players' parents initially voiced their support for Durkin after the school placed him on leave on Aug. 11. When the coach was briefly reinstated last week, other players and parents shared their dissent. Three players walked out of Durkin\u2019s first meeting with the team. The commission that examined the program\u2019s culture found a similar divide in opinion.\n\nAniebonam said the players discussed the differing views but shifted the focus back to football when it came time for meetings and practice.\n\nThe team has moved through this week of game preparation without the threat of a program-altering development, something it had not previously enjoyed. Even when it wasn\u2019t awaiting sudden, potentially program-altering news, the season has been defined by incremental updates that questioned accountability at all levels in the athletic department and university.\n\nMaryland\u2019s season opened with an upset win over Texas just a few weeks after the school placed Durkin on administrative leave, and Matt Canada, who\u2019s never been a head coach, slid into the interim role. The day before Maryland beat Minnesota, the Board of Regents announced the findings of the external investigation that examined the staff\u2019s failures in treating offensive lineman Jordan McNair, who died 15 days after suffering exertional heatstroke in late May. Two days before Maryland defeated Illinois, The Washington Post and other media outlets published the lengthy independent report about the program\u2019s culture.\n\nThrough that lens, last week was certainly a peak in the chaotic season, but it was also just an extension of what the players have faced all year.\n\n\u201cThe quickest way that a program can deteriorate is if people start focusing on the wrong things,\u201d Aniebonam said.\n\nAniebonam praised Canada, who has led the team to a 5-4 record.\n\n\u201cHe took along the leadership role head on and didn't hesitate and I appreciate him for that,\u201d Aniebonam said. \u201cHis biggest thing \u2026 was keeping everyone together, keeping everyone focused on the right things. He's done a tremendous job of relaying that message week to week.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his aspirations to be a head coach, Canada on Tuesday simply emphasized his focus on the Indiana game, the importance of the team sticking together and his approach of not looking any further into the future.\n\nThe team has followed that example, rallying behind the school of thought that always deems the next game the most important one. A win in the trip to Bloomington, Ind., would make Maryland bowl-eligible, something the program has only accomplished three times since Ralph Friedgen\u2019s final season in 2010.\n\nAniebonam is confident that every member of the team understands the value of earning a 13th game.\n\n\u201cWe've done well with avoiding distractions,\u201d senior running back Ty Johnson said. \u201c . . . There's been a lot that's gone on in the past five months so just trying to play football and not have the whole world looking at us in a negative light.\u201d\n\nBy the time the team met last Thursday, the day after Durkin\u2019s firing, the message to the players was to \u201cstick to the plan, stay the course, tunnel vision,\u201d Aniebonam said. Canada sent a letter to the players\u2019 parents with a similar theme and thanking them for their support.\n\n\u201cThrough the mourning process, through all of this, some days somebody\u2019s up, other days down,\u201d Canada said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to grab the guy that\u2019s down and get him, and when you\u2019re down, that\u2019s what a team does. That is the story. I\u2019ve said that multiple times. The story is these kids.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nJohn Feinstein: The next Maryland football coach should be Navy offensive coordinator Ivin Jasper\n\nFernando and Smith stand out, but Terps hoops barely hangs on in season opener against Delaware\n\nMaryland investigators hope school becomes \u2018gold standard\u2019 in student-athlete health\n\nTheir campus reeling, U-Md. students faced a tricky question: Should they support this team?", "NOTHING TESTS character like defeat. President Trump has not had to deal with it much in his brief political career, having smashed through a large field to win the Republican nomination in 2016, followed by a stunning triumph in the general election. Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, which resulted in his Republican Party\u2019s loss of the House of Representatives, presented Mr. Trump with his first real reversal, and he did not respond well. Whereas his predecessor, President Barack Obama, acknowledged a \u201cshellacking\u201d in the 2010 midterms, and President George W. Bush admitted a \u201cthumping\u201d in 2006, Mr. Trump emphasized \u2014 not without reason \u2014 his party\u2019s pickups in the Senate and its apparent successful defense of the governors\u2019 mansions in Ohio, Florida, Georgia and Iowa.\n\nYet there was nothing in his rambling, angry news conference Wednesday to suggest he had heard the message that millions of voters, many of them formerly supporters of the GOP, tried to send him by electing a Democratic majority to the lower chamber. To the contrary, in petty and personal terms he blamed the GOP loss of the House on incumbents who refused to campaign with him for fear (undoubtedly justified) that his backing would do them more harm than good. Another apparent, predictable scapegoat: his now-fired attorney general, Jeff Sessions, a former apologist whom Mr. Trump has long blamed for enabling the special-counsel investigation of Russian election interference. The president\u2019s reading of the election is that \u201cpeople like me, and people like the job I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nIn a democracy, conduct in defeat is not just a matter of intangibles. It has consequences for governance. Mr. Trump mouthed some prepared lines about believing that there are now opportunities for bipartisan legislation, even acknowledging that he \u201crespected\u201d House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s (Calif.) call for cooperation Tuesday night. Yet he contradicted that message with a belligerent threat to match any House investigations of his administration with unspecified counterprobes. He implied legislation could be held hostage to this tit-for-tat: \u201cIf that happens, then we\u2019re going to do the same thing and government comes to a halt,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I would blame them.\u201d\n\nUnder the Constitution, the House has every right, indeed a duty, to conduct hearings and request documents regarding Mr. Trump\u2019s management of the executive branch. A normal president would have recognized and accepted that even when his own party controlled Congress; Republicans should not have left the job undone until a Democratic takeover. We do not have a normal president, and the news conference reconfirmed it, despite any hope that Tuesday night might prompt some reflection on his part. Ms. Pelosi, wisely, declined to take the bait, reiterating her determination to use subpoena power if necessary but insisting Wednesday that oversight \u201cdoes not mean we\u2019ll go look for a fight.\u201d\n\nShe would be well advised to stick to that measured approach, because the country does have recent experience with the excesses of investigation, by both parties, and the harm it can do to the atmosphere for legislation. In contrast to the attitude Mr. Trump exhibited Wednesday, Ms. Pelosi\u2019s remarks suggest that she has the capacity to learn from recent history.", "Two years ago, when President Trump was still on the campaign trail, he told an audience during a rally at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport that Minnesota had \u201csuffered enough\u201d at the hands of Somali immigrants, who began moving there as refugees in the early 1990s.\n\nHe told the crowd that \u201clarge numbers of Somali refugees [are] coming into your state without your knowledge, without your support or approval, and with some of them then joining ISIS and spreading their extremist views all over our country and all over the world.\u201d (ISIS is an alternative acronym for the Islamic State militant group.)\n\nTrump\u2019s assertion was met with confusion and anger in some parts of Minnesota, where tens of thousands of Somali refugees were relocated from their Horn of Africa homeland after its government collapsed in 1991 and civil war broke out. And on Tuesday, one of those refugees won a seat in Congress.\n\nIlhan Omar took home 78 percent of the vote in Minnesota\u2019s 5th Congressional District, becoming the first Somali American, first Muslim refugee and first hijab-wearing Muslim woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. She also became the first woman of color to represent Minnesota in Congress. \u201cWhen people were selling the politics of fear and division and destruction, we were talking about hope. We were talking about the politics of joy,\u201d Omar said in her victory speech.\n\nOmar already knew what it meant to be a \u201cfirst.\u201d In 2016, she was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives, which made her the first Somali American in history to be elected a legislator in the United States.\n\nOmar\u2019s win \u201creinforces the idea that all is possible in America,\u201d said Cawo Abdi, a professor of sociology at the University of Minnesota.

St. Louis, an ocean liner carrying more than 900 German Jews fleeing Europe.\n\nHis speech, just over a week after the massacre at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, showed how anti-Semitism shaped Canada\u2019s response to Jewish refugees fleeing Germany.\n\n\u201cToday, I rise in this House of Commons to issue a long overdue apology to the Jewish refugees Canada turned away,\u201d he said in Ottawa.\n\n\u201cWe used our laws to mask our anti-Semitism, our antipathy, our resentment. We are sorry for the callousness of Canada\u2019s response. And we are sorry for not apologizing sooner.\u201d\n\nSince taking office, Trudeau has delivered several high-profile apologies, so many that he has faced the charge of apologizing too much. Critics wonder what work an apology does, who benefits and whether saying \u201csorry\u201d is ever really enough.\n\nBut coming soon after what may have been the deadliest attack on Jews in American history, at a time when anti-Semitic memes and conspiracy theories abound, Trudeau\u2019s remarks felt urgent.\n\n\u201cHis speech, his words and his apology were very moving and meaningful,\u201d said Avi Benlolo, president of the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies, a Canadian nonprofit organization. \u201cWhat we appreciated from his speech was his focus on contemporary anti-Semitism.\u201d\n\nThe apology connected past to present, showing how the hate that animated Canada\u2019s treatment of Jewish refugees is still ingrained in contemporary politics in Canada, the United States and elsewhere.\n\n\n\nTrudeau said 17 percent of all hate crimes in Canada target Jews.\n\n\u201cHolocaust deniers still exist,\u201d he said. \u201cAnti-Semitism is still far too present. Jewish institutions and neighborhoods are still being vandalized with swastikas.\u201d\n\nHe condemned the attacks in Pittsburgh as a \u201cheinous anti-Semitic act of violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cCanada and Canadians will continue to stand with the Jewish community and call out the hatred that incited such despicable acts,\u201d he said. \u201cThese tragic events ultimately attest to the work we still have to do.\u201d\n\nThe story of the M.S. St. Louis has long been a source of shame for a country that likes to think of itself as a refuge.\n\nIn May 1939, just months before the outbreak of war, an ocean liner left Europe with more than 1,000 passengers, including 907 German Jews. The ship made it to Cuba, but the Jewish refugees were not allowed to disembark. The United States later turned them away.\n\nWith the ship days from Halifax, the Canadian government decided not to help. The ship was sent back to Europe, and 254 of those on board died in the Holocaust.\n\nCanada\u2019s rejection of the St. Louis was not an isolated incident. When it came to Jewish immigration, Canada\u2019s policy at the time was \u201cnone is too many,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\n\u201cOf all the allied countries, Canada would admit the fewest Jews between 1933 and 1945. Far fewer than the United Kingdom and significantly less per capita than the United States,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\nWhen the possibility of an apology for the M.S. St. Louis affair surfaced, some members of the Jewish community expressed concern that a decades-late apology for the turning away of the ship would be too little, too late.\n\nWriting in the Canadian Jewish News, Sally Zerker, an emeritus professor at Toronto\u2019s York University who had family members among those turned away, last year argued that an apology from Trudeau would be \u201cmeaningless.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will not bring back my relatives, or offer me any solace,\u201d she wrote. \u201cInstead, it will whitewash a government that did nothing to help the Jews who were fleeing the Nazis and ignored the type of anti-Semitism that was endemic in Canada until the 1970s.\u201d\n\nOn the eve of the apology, Michael Mostyn, chief executive of B\u2019nai Brith Canada, wrote that the Trudeau government to take action by devoting resources to developing a national action plan to combat anti-Semitism and engage with Jewish institutions, including synagogues, on security.\n\n\u201cThe Jewish community needs committed and concerted action on the part of government to combat the rising tides of anti-Semitism so that, hopefully, there will be no need for apologies in the future,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nCanada\u2019s response to Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s death is a test for Trudeau\n\n\u2018Better than the Olympics\u2019: Canadians line up for marijuana as it becomes legal\n\n\u2018Third World conditions\u2019: Many of Canada\u2019s indigenous people can\u2019t drink the water at home\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "Temperatures made it to around 60 today behind yesterday\u2019s cold front.

Adam Smith (D-Wash.) is poised to take over as chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, which oversees the U.S. military and its funding. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nThe Democratic takeover of the House poses challenges to the Trump administration\u2019s plans to create a Space Force, augment the American nuclear arsenal and draw on military funds to build parts of the border wall, as the Pentagon faces an era of greater scrutiny and tighter funding.\n\nLeading the charge for the Democrats on military issues is likely to be longtime Seattle-area congressman Adam Smith, who is poised to take over as chairman of the powerful House committee that oversees the U.S. armed forces and their funding.\n\nSmith has established a reputation as a defense budget hawk, regularly pressing Republicans on the committee on how the country can afford to reduce government tax revenue while increasing defense spending. The annual defense budget reached $716 billion this year and included the largest baseline budget excluding active overseas deployments since World War II.\n\nEven before the Democrats won the House on Tuesday, the Trump administration was pursuing plans to spend by 4.5 percent less on the military than it had initially planned for next year. The move came in response to a 17 percent increase in the federal deficit in 2018, the largest jump in six years, which resulted in part from the confluence of factors Smith predicted.\n\nHow much is spent on defense will depend on what caps the Republican-controlled Senate and the Trump administration broker with House Democrats for next year. House Democrats are likely to push for a greater share of nondefense spending to fund domestic priorities.\n\nThe most high-profile military expenditure Smith has taken aim at in recent years is a vast overhaul of the nation\u2019s nuclear forces, estimated to cost some $1.2 trillion over 30 years including sustainment.\n\nPresident Barack Obama signed off on the modernization plans as part of a deal to secure the Republican-controlled Senate\u2019s ratification of the New START Treaty in 2010.\n\nBut Smith has described the overhaul \u2014 which includes introducing a new air-launched cruise missile in addition to new nuclear bombers, submarines and intercontinental ballistic missile systems \u2014 as too expensive and unnecessary. He also opposes the low-yield nuclear warheads and cruise missiles the Trump administration wants to put on submarines.\n\nSmith is also against Trump\u2019s proposal to create a Space Force. He agrees with prioritizing space as a military domain but says the Pentagon does not need an entirely new and costly bureaucracy that would come with creating a separate military branch.\n\n\u201cWe must do a better job of dealing with space as a national security priority,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI will continue to work toward a smarter, more effective approach.\u201d\n\nApart from trying to scale back what he sees as unnecessary spending, Smith is likely to focus on forcing the Pentagon to answer more questions in public about its military programs and deployments, including Trump\u2019s recent order to send active-duty forces to the border with Mexico.\n\nIn an Oct. 28 op-ed in the online publication Defense One, Smith argued that the Trump administration had wrapped the Pentagon in \u201ca blanket of unaccountability\u201d by seeking to roll back \u201ctransparency norms that have been in effect and functioning well since the mid-twentieth century.\u201d\n\nHe said the administration had curtailed the Pentagon\u2019s interactions with the news media, prevented the public release of cost schedules and weapons system assessments and sought to prevent defense officials from testifying before Congress.\n\n\u201cThe message from the top has been to withhold information from Congress, the public, and the press, even as President Trump has simultaneously taken inappropriate steps to politicize the military,\u201d Smith wrote.\n\nIn particular, Smith recently promised to get answers from the Pentagon about the justification for Trump\u2019s troop deployment to the southern border.\n\n\u201cWe would ask the Pentagon to come in and explain to us in an open public hearing what they\u2019re doing and why,\u201d Smith told Washington Post opinion writer Greg Sargent. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should let the president get away with this type of policy with no justification and no explanation for it.\u201d\n\nSmith spearheaded a letter sent by 108 House Democrats questioning the border deployment and separately decrying the use of Pentagon funds to build a wall along a stretch of the border in Arizona where a military bombing range abuts Mexico.\n\nThe letter criticized the Pentagon for approving $7.5 million in advance-planning funds for a roughly 35-mile border barrier at the Barry M. Goldwater Range. House Democrats said the barrier could cost as much as $450 million. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has defended the structure as a way to prevent migrants\u2019 endangering themselves by entering the range.\n\nSmith is also concerned about the money the Pentagon spends to maintain bases and other infrastructure that the military has formally said it does not need. He has been pushing for Congress to begin a Base Realignment and Closure exercise, better known as BRAC, to get rid of excess military infrastructure.\n\nMattis followed previous secretaries of defense in calling for a BRAC in 2017, but he didn\u2019t do so amid the budget largesse of 2018. The issue is likely to resurface as the Pentagon looks to economize under increased budget pressure.\n\nCongress has not permitted the Pentagon to undertake a BRAC since 2005, largely because lawmakers have not wanted to risk the unpopular closure of bases in their districts. In 2016, the Pentagon predicted that some 22 percent of its bases would qualify as excess capacity by 2019, what defense officials have described as billions of dollars of wasted money.\n\nWhile the Democrats favor retaining the Obama administration\u2019s policy of allowing transgender individuals to serve in the military, the matter remains tied up in the courts, and it is unclear whether its new leverage in the House will allow the party to press the matter.\n\nDemocrats have also been particularly vocal about the Pentagon\u2019s failure to properly account for civilian casualties caused by U.S. military airstrikes. They are likely to press the Defense Department to implement measures in this year\u2019s annual defense policy bill aimed at increasing accountability and oversight of the process for identifying whether the military caused such deaths.", "A high-stakes lawsuit involving victims of the 2000 attack of the USS Cole seemed to divide the Supreme Court on Wednesday, as justices struggled with the seemingly innocuous question of whether notice of the suit was sent to the right address.\n\nThe answer has enormous consequences for the victims \u2014 they won a nearly $315 million default judgment against the Republic of Sudan \u2014 and apparently for the U.S. government, which said a ruling against Sudan could harm international relations and endanger the government\u2019s legal position in the world.\n\n[USS Cole victims opposed at Supreme Court by unlikely pair: U.S. and Sudan]\n\nSudan\u2019s foreign minister, Mohamed Ahmed El Dirdiri, said he was in the audience for the Supreme Court hearing. At a private event at the Atlantic Council later, he said that Sudan\u2019s \u201cintention is to merely show concern and real interest, and that this is one issue that we take very seriously.\u201d\n\nDirdiri met with Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan on Tuesday, and said that Sudan \u201cengaged in this matter with the United States administration,\u201d but did not offer additional details.\n\nThe legal issue in the case is a directive in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that notice of any legal action against a foreign government be \u201caddressed and dispatched\u201d to the head of that country\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nLawsuits against Sudan for providing material support for the al-Qaeda attack were sent to the Sudanese Embassy in Washington. But Christopher M. Curran, a lawyer representing Sudan, told the court that they should have been sent to the foreign minister\u2019s office in Khartoum.\n\nIf Curran is right, the judgments against the country would be vacated.\n\nOne appeals court has looked at the question and said mailing a notice to the embassy was fine. Another sided with Curran.\n\nThe justices seemed similarly divided.\n\n\u201cI have to say . . . that would be my first thought: Why don\u2019t I deliver it to the embassy?\u201d said Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. \u201cMailing it to the foreign minister in some country and assuming it\u2019s going to get there in any reasonable time, I think you\u2019re much more likely to reach them through the embassy.\u201d\n\nCurran said the foreign minister does not have an office at the embassy. \u201cSo it literally would not be complying with the statutory language to send the mailing to that diplomatic mission,\u201d he said.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan said there is no language in the statute that says it must be addressed to the foreign minister\u2019s office. \u201cEverybody understands that embassies are supposed to be the point of contact if you want to do anything with respect to a foreign government,\u201d she said.\n\nJustice Samuel A. Alito Jr. was also a tough questioner. He noted the law was written before the \u201cera of FedEx\u201d and wondered whether it was really so simple to send a package with a \u201cReturn Receipt Requested and it comes back from the far reaches of the world?\u201d\n\nCurran responded that what is known is that Congress decided not to require that such notices be filed with embassies because countries objected to that.\n\nJustice Department lawyer \u00adErica Ross said service at embassies could violate the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which says that the premises of an embassy are \u201cinviolable.\u201d\n\nBut what practical harm does the United States see in mailing notices to an embassy? Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh asked.\n\n\u201cThe harm is that the United States has embassies all over the world, obviously, and sort of deputizing each of those to accept service on behalf of the United States is quite problematic,\u201d Ross said.\n\nThe Oct. 12, 2000, attack on the Cole, when it was refueling at a harbor in Yemen, killed 17 American sailors \u2014 15 men and two women \u2014 and wounded 42. Washington lawyer Kannon K. Shanmugam represents the families of the dead and those wounded.\n\nHe said it would be wrong to throw out the judgments they had received because of an \u201cunstated procedural requirement.\u201d\n\nBut he faced hard questions.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor said the \u201caddressed and dispatched\u201d language implied a sense of urgency to make sure it got to the foreign minister, rather than mailing it to the embassy in the United States.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t ignore that it\u2019s not the place where the person usually is,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that concept, I think, is the essence of due process.\u201d\n\nJustice Stephen G. Breyer said research by his clerks showed two dozen countries, such as the United States, do not accept legal notice at their embassies. \u201cI could find nothing the other way\u201d that would support Shanmugam\u2019s position, he told the lawyer.\n\nKavanaugh was also concerned. \u201cThe point you\u2019re making is it\u2019s not a big deal to allow service at an embassy, even though the United States objects and even though, as Justice Breyer points out, no other country appears to allow that.\u201d\n\nAlito and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had a practical concern: Did the mailing at the embassy actually give Sudan notice of the suit?\n\n\u201cSudan unquestionably had actual notice of the litigation,\u201d Shanmugam said, and decided not to show up. It was only after the victims had won a default judgment and were attempting to access Sudanese assets held in New York banks did Sudan file its objections, he said.\n\nCurran was circumspect when he was asked. He said there was \u201cnothing in the record\u201d to indicate the Sudanese foreign minister received the notice sent to the embassy, although an employee signed for it. Under further questioning, he acknowledged that Sudan had notice of the suit sometime before the default judgment was filed.\n\nIf the court rules for Sudan, the judgment for the families probably would be thrown out, and the legal process must begin anew. In that case, \u201cSudan is committed to appearing and defending itself,\u201d Curran told Alito. \u201cIt believes that the default judgment was ill-founded. It has substantial defenses and it would like to contest the charges.\u201d\n\nThe case is Republic of Sudan v. Harrison.\n\nSiobhan O\u2019Grady contributed to this report.", "Opinion writer\n\nJust in case the Democratic capture of the House of Representatives tempted you to relax for a moment about the state of our country, President Trump quickly moved to remind us that we still have no idea how low he\u2019s going to sink \u2014 or how much damage he\u2019ll do along the way.\n\nThis happened on multiple fronts. Here\u2019s the most immediate one:\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions resigned on Wednesday at President Trump\u2019s request, ending the tenure of a loyalist Trump had soured on shortly after Sessions took office in 2017 because the former senator from Alabama had recused himself from oversight of the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. In a letter to Trump, Sessions wrote he had been \u201chonored to serve as Attorney General\u201d and had \u201cworked to implement the law enforcement agenda based on the rule of law that formed a central part of your campaign for the presidency.\u201d Trump tweeted that Sessions would be replaced on an acting basis by Matthew G. Whitaker, who had been serving as Sessions\u2019s chief of staff.\n\nAt the center of this decision to force out Sessions is the ongoing investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Trump has long raged at Sessions for recusing himself from the probe, rather than constraining it on Trump\u2019s behalf. We all knew this day would come as a result, because, as The Post notes, the two men were fundamentally at odds over whether it\u2019s the proper role of the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer to protect Trump\u2019s personal and legal interests:\n\nA person close to Sessions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be frank, said the attorney general . . . thought that by staying in the job, he had protected the integrity of the investigation, the person said. In the long run, Sessions is convinced that the country will be better served by the investigation proceeding naturally, as the findings will be more credible to the American public, the person said.\n\nHowever sincere this is, it has long been obvious that any attorney general who did not place Trump\u2019s own interests over those of the country would have to go.\n\n[Cartoons: Jeff Sessions\u2019s tenure as attorney general]\n\nDemocrats immediately pounced on the news that Whitaker will replace him, pointing to highly questionable comments he\u2019s made about the Mueller probe. Before becoming Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, Whitaker suggested regulations allowed for Trump to put in an acting replacement for the attorney general \u2014 meaning one who would not have to be confirmed by the Senate \u2014 who could, if he wished, starve the Mueller probe of funds:\n\n\u201cSo I could see a scenario where Jeff Sessions is replaced with a recess appointment,\u201d Whitaker said, \u201cand that attorney general doesn\u2019t fire Bob Mueller, but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\u201d\n\nNow this person, conveniently enough, is Whitaker. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein oversees the investigation, but the new acting attorney general, by not recusing himself, might be able to carry out such a scenario. According to legal expert Stephen Vladeck, Whitaker supplants Rosenstein as overseer of the investigation. This raises at least the possibility that some sort of effort to constrain the probe could be put in motion during the lame-duck period, that is, before Democrats take over the House.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer is calling on Whitaker to recuse himself over his previous comments. And Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a member of the Intelligence Committee, just put out a statement pointing out that \u201creplacing the Attorney General with a non-Senate-confirmed political staffer is highly irregular and unacceptable.\u201d Blumenthal called for new legislation to protect the Mueller investigation, describing this as a \u201cbreak the glass moment.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell does not see the same urgency. He cheerfully wished Sessions well without mentioning word boo about the Mueller investigation. McConnell, you may recall, has blithely dismissed any need for Mueller-protection legislation in the past.\n\nWhatever is to be on this front, note that it comes after Trump gave a startlingly unhinged performance at a news conference Wednesday. He flatly declared he can \u201cfire\u201d everyone associated with the Mueller investigation if he wishes, repeatedly dismissing it as a hoax. He raged at CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta, angrily shouting that CNN is \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nAnd then, after a reporter pressed Trump on whether his declaration that he is a \u201cnationalist\u201d amounted to an embrace of white nationalism, this happened:\n\nAsked about calling himself a \"nationalist\" Trump attacks reporter for asking \"terrible\" \"racist\" question. pic.twitter.com/Fvv6nGaBK0 \u2014 Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) November 7, 2018\n\nOne shudders to imagine the message that white nationalist and alt-right groups will take from the spectacle of the president of the United States dressing down a black reporter\u2019s question (Trump was also very abusive toward another black female reporter, April Ryan) about his white nationalism as \u201cracist.\u201d Given that these groups are already emboldened by the ongoing mainstreaming of their views at the hands of Trump and others, this is just an extraordinary act of malicious and destructive intent.\n\nThere is a tendency after big electoral victories such as the one last night to grow a bit complacent, to imagine that a semblance of normalcy has been restored. In multiple ways, Trump reminded us today that we can\u2019t relax even for a second.\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: Trump freaks out after the election and ousts Sessions\n\nThe most interesting outcomes from the midterm elections\n\nKaren Tumulty: Trump is right: Nancy Pelosi should be the next speaker\n\nYuval Levin: The 2018 midterms told a tale of two weak parties\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Jeff Sessions\u2019s ouster is not surprising. But it\u2019s still shocking.", "Columnist\n\nThe 2018 elections began the demolition of the Trump coalition.\n\nThere remains much work to do. The results in some states were disappointing, and President Trump\u2019s grip on the Republican Party was strengthened. But a large majority of Americans rejected the president\u2019s divisive, ethnonationalist politics. Democrats shook his hold on voters in the old industrial heartland. And women won in unprecedented numbers.\n\nThe anti-Trump movement\u2019s single most important objective was to break unified Republican control of Washington. The opposition achieved this by taking over the House. With votes still to be counted, the Democrats were likely to gain more than 30 seats, and possibly into the mid-to-high 30s.\n\nAs important for the long term, the popular vote share for Democratic candidates was overwhelming \u2014 when all of slow-counting California\u2019s votes are tallied, the Democrats\u2019 margin will likely surpass the GOP\u2019s in their 1994, 2010 and 2014 waves. While only a third of the Senate was up, all House seats were on the ballot. So the House vote is the best indicator of disaffection with Trump.\n\nMost striking was Democratic success in the historically blue-collar states and counties that flipped to Trump in 2016 and led to his victory.\n\nDemocrats held Senate seats in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, all key for him two years ago. They picked up governorships in Wisconsin and Michigan and held on to Pennsylvania\u2019s by a landslide. Democrats gained at least seven governorships from the Republicans, rebuilding from the disastrous midterm outcomes during President Barack Obama\u2019s terms.\n\nEspecially significant was the defeat of Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker by state schools superintendent Tony Evers. Walker, an avatar of the conservative movement, had survived a recall and seemed to have nine political lives. His loss was part of Tuesday\u2019s larger message: Many Democrats up and down the ballot, Evers among them, prevailed as pragmatic problem solvers opposing the GOP\u2019s ideologues \u2014 a formula described by former Iowa governor Tom Vilsack as involving candidates \u201cmoderate in tone but progressive in thinking.\u201d\n\nEvers won back counties in southwestern Wisconsin that had strayed Republican, and this was a theme across the Midwest.\n\nIn Ohio, Mahoning County, home of blue-collar Youngstown, registered one of the larger anti-Democratic swings in the country in 2016: Obama had secured 63 percent of its votes in 2012; Hillary Clinton got less than 50 percent. But this year, Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown won 60 percent in the county, very close to his showing in 2012. Even in defeat, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Richard Cordray secured 55 percent of Mahoning County\u2019s vote.\n\nThe same Democratic math applied in Erie County, Pa., where Obama won 58 percent and Clinton only 47 percent. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf earned 60 percent of the county\u2019s vote, while Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. won 58 percent.\n\nShifts of this sort reflected a Democratic campaign relentlessly focused on health care, education, infrastructure and other economic concerns. In particular, the 2018 election will mark the triumph of Obamacare. A losing cause four and six years ago, the Affordable Care Act now defines the minimum standard for what Americans expect from their government when it comes to guaranteeing health coverage.\n\nThere were certainly Democratic disappointments \u2014 in particular, the narrow defeat in Florida of Andrew Gillum, an African American who preached racial unity, by Rep. Ron DeSantis, who has openly associated with far-right extremists.\n\nAt his post-election news conference Wednesday, Trump unsurprisingly bragged about Republican gains in the Senate and ascribed the victories to his own campaigning. But the clear pickups, coming in the core conservative states of North Dakota, Indiana and Missouri, also defined the limits of Trump\u2019s strategy. Even as Trumpism was receding in swing areas and among moderate and suburban voters \u2014 well-educated women, above all \u2014 his party was being more and more defined in his image.\n\nTrump made clear that he will have it no other way. A president whose extremism led to the defeat of scores of more moderate Republicans stood before reporters and spitefully trashed vanquished GOP candidates who had wisely chosen to distance themselves from him.\n\nRather than take responsibility for outcomes his hard-line campaigning helped bring about, Trump effectively said these Republicans lost because of their refusal to bow to him. Such a tone will continue to alienate the sorts of voters who entrusted the House to the Democrats.\n\nDemocracy is a long game. It requires commitment and patience.

He said the U.S. has evidence that Iranian vessels are trying to evade U.S. sanctions by disabling location transponders used to prevent collisions.\n\n\u201cThis tactic is a maritime security threat,\u201d Hook said. \u201cThese transponders are designed to maximize visibility at sea and turning them off only increases risk of accidents and injuries. Self-insured Iranian tankers engaging in unsafe behavior, with many tons of crude oil on board, is courting environmental and financial disaster.\u201d\n\nThe sanctions that came into force Monday target Iran\u2019s energy, financial and shipping sectors and mark the end of U.S. participation in the 2015 nuclear deal that President Donald Trump withdrew from in May.\n\nThe sanctions aim to further isolate Iran by choking off its main source of revenue \u2014 oil exports \u2014 by imposing sanctions on countries and companies that do not end their imports.\n\nHowever, some trade is still allowed, as the administration has granted waivers for eight major importers to continue buying Iranian petroleum products without penalty for another six months.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Jeff Kowalsky/Reuters)\n\nVoters in Michigan, Betsy DeVos\u2019s home state, handed the education secretary a stinging rebuke in Tuesday\u2019s elections, voting in a new governor who spoke out against DeVos\u2019s education agenda.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t the only place DeVos\u2019s agenda got smacked by voters. While Tuesday\u2019s elections results weren\u2019t all bad news for her, voters rejected her agenda in Wisconsin, Arizona, Illinois and other states. And the Democratic takeover of the House is bad news for her, too, with the majority now likely to intensify its oversight of her department.\n\nGretchen Whitmer, a former minority leader of the Michigan state Senate, campaigned as a friend of the troubled Detroit public school district and promised to invest more money in public schools, focus on early-childhood education and respect teachers.\n\nAnd she went straight after DeVos, a Michigan billionaire who has long been prominent in the movement to find alternatives to traditional public school districts and who once said that public schools are \u201ca dead end.\u201d DeVos has been a strong supporter of charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately managed, and of programs that use public money for private and public education.\n\nDeVos was a major force in the troubled expansion of charter schools in Michigan, which has, by far, the highest percentage of schools operated by for-profit companies of any state. DeVos was born and raised in Michigan, where she was chairwoman of the state Republican Party.\n\nCharters run by for-profit companies have worse outcomes for students than those run by nonprofits, according to research, which also shows that public school districts are losing resources to charters in the state.\n\n[How charter schools in Michigan have hurt traditional public schools, new research finds]\n\nWhitmer didn\u2019t mince words when it came to DeVos, blaming her for Michigan\u2019s slide in state rankings of education. Her campaign literature said:\n\nA generation ago, Michigan led the world in public education. This was the state families packed up and moved to because parents knew their children could get a quality education and the skills they needed to get a good-paying job. As a mom with two daughters in high school, these are the same opportunities I want for my own kids. But over the past eight years, Republicans in Lansing have sided with Betsy DeVos to push an education agenda that included slashing school funding, expanding unaccountable for-profit managed charter schools, over-emphasizing standardized tests, attacking hard-working educators and adopting a one-size fits all approach to education that has left our kids behind. This agenda has resulted in Michigan being near the bottom of the country on almost every meaningful metric from student literacy to college preparedness. Our educational crisis affects urban, rural and suburban school systems alike, and it disproportionately affects kids who are at-risk or have special needs. It doesn\u2019t have to be like this.\n\nTo be sure, there was some good electoral news for DeVos, including the election of Republican Ron DeSantis as Florida governor. DeSantis is a strong believer in expanding school choice. And in California, a pro-charter-school candidate was ahead in the race for state superintendent of public instruction, though he does not support all of the DeVos agenda.\n\nBut in Wisconsin, a Democratic education secretary, Tony Evers, took the governorship away from the Republican incumbent, Scott Walker, who was an education ally of DeVos\u2019s.\n\nIn Arizona, voters overturned a law that had expanded the state\u2019s school voucher program, though they did reelect a Republican governor who supports charters and vouchers.\n\nIn Illinois, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, who supported DeVos\u2019s school choice agenda, lost his reelection bid to a Democrat.\n\nAnd some educators who have been critical of DeVos won election to state and federal legislative seats. For example, in a historic win, Jahana Hayes, the 2016 National Teacher of the Year, won a seat in the House from Connecticut, the first black woman from the state to serve in Congress.\n\nHow will this affect DeVos and her tenure? Stay tuned.", "", "Opinion writer\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s party lost the House \u2014 handing Democrats one chamber\u2019s subpoena powers \u2014 and racked up big losses in governors\u2019 races. So naturally, Trump freaked out.\n\nFirst came the press conference, freakish even for him. The Post reports:\n\nPresident Trump threatened Wednesday to retaliate with a \u201cwarlike posture\u201d should the new Democratic House majority use its subpoena power to launch investigations into his administration, warning that any probes would jeopardize prospects for bipartisan deals. . . . \u201cI could fire everybody right now, but I don\u2019t want to stop it because politically I don\u2019t like stopping it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace. It should never have been started, because there is no crime.\u201d Trump answered questions from journalists for an extraordinary one hour and 26 minutes in a rare formal news conference in the East Room of the White House. He repeatedly lost his cool as reporters peppered him. He attacked CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta, calling him \u201ca rude, terrible person\u201d and saying his network should be \u201cashamed\u201d of him, and then snapped at Peter Alexander of NBC News and directed April Ryan of American Urban Radio to \u201csit down.\u201d\n\nBehaving more like a wounded animal than a president claiming vindication, he sounded peevish and more overtly racist than usual:\n\nWhen Yamiche Alcindor of \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d asked the president whether by identifying as a \u201cnationalist\u201d he also was embracing the label \u201cwhite nationalist,\u201d he told her repeatedly, \u201cThat\u2019s such a racist question.\u201d \u201cTo say what you just said is so insulting to me,\u201d Trump responded to Alcindor, who is black.\n\nHe claimed not to understand questions from reporters who spoke in somewhat accented English. And he singled out and excoriated one Republican losing incumbent after another, bashing them for not embracing him more strongly.\n\nBut that turned out to be just the warmup for Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s departure. The Post reports:\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions resigned on Wednesday at President Trump\u2019s request, ending the tenure of a loyalist Trump had soured on shortly after Sessions took office in 2017 because the former senator from Alabama had recused himself from oversight of the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nIn a letter to Trump, Sessions wrote he had been \u201chonored to serve as Attorney General\u201d and had \u201cworked to implement the law enforcement agenda based on the rule of law that formed a central part of your campaign for the presidency.\u201d Trump tweeted that Sessions would be replaced on an acting basis by Matthew G. Whitaker, who had been serving as Sessions\u2019s chief of staff. Whitaker, not Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, is now overseeing Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe.\n\nThe move raises a host of issues. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) who will soon chair the Judiciary Committee, tweeted out:\n\nAmericans must have answers immediately as to the reasoning behind @realDonaldTrump removing Jeff Sessions from @TheJusticeDept. Why is the President making this change and who has authority over Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation? We will be holding people accountable. https://t.co/weykMuiCxm \u2014 (((Rep. Nadler))) (@RepJerryNadler) November 7, 2018\n\nTrump had threatened to in effect go to war to defend himself, and this appears to be his first move to test the limits of Democrats\u2019 patience and power. Should moves be made to fire Mueller or curtail his investigation (Trump said at the press conference he could fire Mueller whenever he wanted but chose not to), we will face a serious constitutional standoff.\n\nResponding to the decision, the American Civil Liberties Union released a statement, which read in part: \u201cThe dismissal of the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official is a huge step, one that should not be based on political motives \u2014 and certainly should not be done to protect the president or his cronies from the law. While the constitution grants the president the authority to dismiss his cabinet members, we will be keeping a close watch on the future of the special counsel\u2019s investigation and the impact of the appointment of a new Attorney General.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU continued: \u201cThe Senate must demand that any nominee for attorney general must commit to not interfere in the special counsel investigation, and continue to have Robert Mueller operate under the special counsel regulation.\u201d\n\nGiven the new pro-Trump members of the Senate, there are plenty of reasons to doubt this will occur.\n\nAs for Sessions, he surely will go down as one of the worst attorneys general in recent memory. His defense of the Muslim ban, his nonsensical attack on so-called sanctuary cities (falsely arguing immigrants created a crime wave), renewed war on nonviolent drug users, lack of interest in pursuing obvious voter suppression tactics and other highly partisan moves will mar his legacy and diminish DOJ\u2019s reputation.\n\nIn short, welcome to an even worse version of Trump \u2014 defensive, cornered, possibly looking at indictments of more aides or family members. Democrats must hold him and his enablers accountable, understanding that in all likelihood, they are building a case to vote him and his GOP lackeys out in 2020.\n\nRead more:\n\nCartoons: Jeff Sessions\u2019s tenure as attorney general\n\nJennifer Rubin: What do the midterms say about 2020?\n\nMichael Gerson: Trump is leaving a trail of ruin behind him\n\nRobert J.

(Jabin Botsford; Win McNamee/The Washington Post; Getty Images)\n\nWithin hours of his appointment, there were mounting calls by congressional Democrats and government watchdog groups for Whitaker to recuse himself, citing critical comments he made about Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nFurious Democrats, emboldened by winning control of the House in Tuesday\u2019s elections, also promised to investigate Sessions\u2019s forced resignation and suggested Trump\u2019s actions could amount to obstruction of justice if he intended to disrupt the criminal probe.\n\n\u201cThere is no mistaking what this means, and what is at stake: this is a constitutionally perilous moment for our country and for the President,\u201d Rep. Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.) said in a statement. He is set to take over in January as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, the panel that would oversee any impeachment proceedings.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called Wednesday\u2019s events \u201ca break-the-glass moment\u201d and said he would be introducing legislation to protect Mueller\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cAny attempt to limit his resources or the scope of his investigation is unacceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world, and history, are watching.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Mueller declined to comment.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to push Sessions out conflicted with comments he offered during a news conference on Wednesday when he insisted he had a right to end the investigation but said that he would prefer to \u201clet it go on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could fire everybody right now, but I don\u2019t want to stop it because politically I don\u2019t like stopping it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace. It should never have been started, because there is no crime.\u201d\n\nJustice Department officials said Whitaker will follow the regular process for reviewing possible ethical conflicts, a process that involves ethics lawyers reviewing an official\u2019s past work to see whether there are financial or personal conflicts that preclude them from being involved in particular cases.\n\nWhitaker, a former U.S. attorney in Iowa, once mused as a legal commentator about how a Sessions replacement might reduce Mueller\u2019s budget \u201cso low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\u201d In an August 2017 tweet, he wrote that an opinion piece calling the special counsel investigation a \u201cMueller lynch mob\u201d was \u201cworth a read.\u201d\n\nWhitaker also wrote in a September 2017 column that Mueller had \u201ccome up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing\u201d after CNN reported that the special counsel could be looking into Trump and his associates\u2019 financial ties to Russia.\n\nHe also has ties to Sam Clovis, who served as Trump\u2019s national campaign chairman and has been interviewed as a witness by Mueller\u2019s investigators about his interactions with foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos. Whitaker chaired Clovis\u2019s campaign for Iowa state treasurer in 2014.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently friends,\u201d Clovis said of Whitaker in an interview with The Washington Post on Wednesday. \u201cI texted him congratulations today.\u201d\n\nWhitaker has not been confirmed by the Senate and, by law, can serve for only 210 days before he must be replaced by someone who has been confirmed. That period could be extended if Trump nominates a replacement who is not immediately confirmed.\n\nIf Whitaker takes over direct supervision of the Russia investigation from Rosenstein, he would assume budget authority for Mueller\u2019s work, giving him the ability to sharply reduce Mueller\u2019s staff and resources. His approval would also be required before Mueller could take major investigative steps, including asking a grand jury for additional indictments.\n\nAny report that Mueller issues describing his overall findings would be submitted to Whitaker, who could decide it contained privileged material that should not be made public.\n\n\u201cDiscretion is such a part of what prosecutors do,\u201d said former U.S. attorney Barbara McQuade. \u201cHe can\u2019t obstruct justice, but he would have the ability to make discretionary decisions that could in many ways influence the outcome of the investigation.\u201d\n\nStill, Whitaker faces some limitations.\n\nJustice Department regulations would allow him to fire Mueller, but only for misconduct, conflict of interest or other \u201cgood cause.\u201d\n\nThe regulations would allow him to reject requests by Mueller to take major steps in the investigation. Should he do so, however, he would be required to provide the chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate judiciary committees a \u201cdescription and explanation of instances\u201d in which he overruled the special counsel.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s appointment comes at a particularly critical moment, just as Mueller was expected to end what has been a publicly quiet phase of his investigation.\n\nIn the run-up to Election Day, there were no indictments or public pronouncements by the special counsel\u2019s office, in keeping with Justice Department guidelines that prosecutors should avoid taking steps that could be perceived as intending to influence the outcome of the vote.\n\nWith the midterm elections now over, Mueller faces key decision points in his 18-month-old investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign \u2014 a probe that has led to charges against 32 people, including 26 Russians. Four aides to Trump have pleaded guilty to various charges, most recently his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort in September.\n\nAmong the most pressing matters now before the special counsel: a probe into longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone\u2019s activities and ongoing negotiations with Trump\u2019s legal team over a request to interview him.\n\nFor months, Mueller has been seeking to question Trump as part of his investigation, which is also examining whether the president has sought to obstruct the probe.\n\nMueller\u2019s prosecutors have laid out detailed allegations of how Russia sought to manipulate Americans through social media, break into state voting systems and hack the email accounts of Democratic committees and party leaders.\n\nBut the special counsel\u2019s team has not indicated publicly that it has drawn any conclusions about whether Trump associates conspired with the Russians or whether the president obstructed justice.\n\n[Newly empowered, House Democrats plan to launch immediate investigations of Trump, but leaders are wary of impeachment]\n\nBehind the scenes, Mueller\u2019s investigators have been intensively gathering evidence and questioning witnesses in recent weeks.\n\nThe grand jury hearing evidence in the Russia investigation has been seen meeting at a federal courthouse in Washington on six of the last eight Fridays.\n\nBased on witnesses who have been called to the grand jury, the special counsel appears to be intensely focused on Stone.\n\nThe longtime Trump friend and former adviser is under scrutiny for claims he made in the 2016 campaign that suggested he was in contact with WikiLeaks. In the final months of the White House race, the group published Democratic emails that prosecutors allege were hacked by Russian military operatives.\n\nStone has repeatedly maintained that he was not in touch with WikiLeaks and did not have advance knowledge of its plans. He said he based his comments on publicly available interviews with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and tips from associates, including New York comedian and radio host Randy Credico, who interviewed Assange on his program in August 2016.\n\nCredico has denied serving as a back channel to Assange for Stone.\n\nIn recent weeks, two more Stone associates testified before the grand jury \u2014 among at least nine people connected to Stone who have been contacted by prosecutors so far.\n\nFilmmaker David Lugo and lawyer Tyler Nixon both told The Post last month that Credico acknowledged to them he gave Stone information from Assange. Lugo, who appeared before the grand jury Oct. 19, said he turned over text messages and emails to Mueller\u2019s team. Nixon said he testified last week.\n\n[Special counsel examines conflicting accounts as scrutiny of Roger Stone and WikiLeaks deepens]\n\nSeparately, conservative writer Jerome Corsi was interviewed by investigators over three days last week and appears to be emerging as a key witness in the Mueller investigation into Stone\u2019s activities.\n\nIn an appearance on his live-streamed Internet show Monday, Corsi told viewers that he has been in near-continuous contact with Mueller\u2019s team in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been two months, on a really constant basis in the Mueller investigation. It\u2019s been one of the biggest pushes of my life,\u201d said Corsi, who added that he could provide no specifics of his interactions with Mueller.\n\nDavid Gray, an attorney for Corsi, declined to comment.\n\nMeanwhile, the special counsel must decide whether to accept only written answers from the president or to fight for an interview. Such a move would probably require issuing a subpoena to the president, which would then draw a legal challenge from Trump\u2019s team.\n\nBy mid-November, the president\u2019s attorneys plan to turn over Trump\u2019s written answers to roughly a dozen questions the special counsel has posed \u2014 including the president\u2019s knowledge of the hacked Democratic emails and his advisers\u2019 contacts with Russians during the campaign and transition, according to two people familiar with the decision.\n\nRobert Costa, Devlin Barrett, Spencer S. Hsu, Manuel Roig-Franzia, Philip Rucker and Tom Hamburger contributed to this report.", "", "Columnist\n\nThe dullest sports column is one that says: In a highly charged and controversial situation involving the largest contract in the history of American professional sports, everyone involved is acting courteously and wisely. Carry on.\n\nIn the case of Bryce Harper and the Washington Nationals, we\u2019re stuck with just such sensible, classy behavior on both sides. And both sides are benefiting.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post\u2019s Chelsea Janes, the Nats made a significant long-term contract offer to Harper on Sept. 26. He didn\u2019t take it, but the Nats discussed terms for a new deal with Harper and his agent, Scott Boras, throughout September. Thus, groundwork has been laid and goodwill maintained.\n\nAlso, of huge importance to both, all public relations fences and private feelings remain in good order. Boras, his clients (such as Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg) and the Lerner family are always entwined. Next megadeal to consider: Anthony Rendon, who will be a free agent after 2019. Who is the Nats\u2019 first significant offseason signing for $7 million, plus an option? Reliever Trevor Rosenthal, a Boras client. These folks flat out can\u2019t afford a nasty fight.\n\nMy take \u2014 and hope \u2014 throughout this process has been that the Nats and Harper stay on good terms. The most likely case, just because so many scenarios are in play, is that some deal or sequence of deals gets done \u2014 the Nats sign a major free agent, or Harper gets a blow-away offer \u2014 that catalyzes a Harper departure in which no one is at fault. If so, that\u2019s life. But don\u2019t make Harper leave.\n\nBecause cheerful scenarios exist, too. If his best offers turn out to be from the St. Louis Cardinals, San Francisco Giants and Philadelphia Phillies, as some now suspect, with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Chicago Cubs or New York Yankees not top bidders, then the Nats want to be in that tussle. Does brash, flashy Bryce really want to spend his life playing before old-school Cardinals fans? Or with the total-rebuild Giants? The Phillies have cash, but after Harper has truly enjoyed seven years in D.C., is Philadelphia going to win that beauty pageant showdown?\n\n[As free agency heats up, Harper begins a \u2018social media fast\u2019]\n\nThe size of the Harper jackpot is still a mystery. While people close to the situation told Janes that the Nats\u2019 offer was \u201caggressive\u201d and one person termed it \u201chistoric,\u201d it was less than the daydream number of $400 million that has floated around Harper for years. If you want to guess $300 million for 10 years, go ahead, but be aware that both the Nats and Boras want the highest possible number to be in circulation. That helps Boras drive up his client\u2019s price; the Nats look fair no matter what happens and, come Rendon time, everybody\u2019s happy.\n\nThe most candid words came from Mike Rizzo at the general managers\u2019 meeting this week. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable with the alternative [to Harper re-signing],\u201d Rizzo said, referring to the Nats\u2019 ability to field an inexpensive but potentially very good outfield of Juan Soto, Victor Robles, Adam Eaton and Michael A. Taylor without Harper. \u201cBut I\u2019m uncomfortable with the statement that we\u2019re a better team without him.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s true. But the Nats have an even more desperate need than Harper. They must add starting pitching if they are going to play in October while Scherzer is still excellent and signed through 2021. The Nats also need a quality reliever and, if they could afford it, upgrades at catcher and perhaps second base.\n\nThat\u2019s why Rizzo also said, \u201cIt behooves us to have an expiration date\u201d on waiting for Harper. The Nats will be negotiating on \u201cparallel tracks\u201d with free agents such as top southpaw starters Patrick Corbin and Dallas Keuchel.\n\nThis auction class is so ridiculously deep at some positions of need, especially relievers of all types, solid back-end starters and second basemen, that the Nats\u2019 free agent cash pile may be dished out on a first-grab, first-get basis. For example, D.J. LeMahieu, a three-time Gold Glove winner at second base who won the batting title in 2016 (at .348) and is still only 30, isn\u2019t even listed among the top 25 free agents by MLB.com.\n\n[Juan Soto was the surprise of the Nats\u2019 season, and he\u2019s not going away]\n\nWithout a doubt, the Nats\u2019 big contract offer and the September talks improve their chances of retaining Harper. Harper and Boras now have a stake to put in the ground, establishing a minimum Harper value. Does that gift to Harper \u2014 because no deal offered Sept. 26 is likely to get done \u2014 come with an unspoken quid pro quo? Do the Nats now get the final phone call before any deal gets done?\n\nThe Nats have given Harper another negotiating gift with other teams. Their big offer is an endorsement of his character \u2014 on the field and off. The Nats know him best, vastly better than any other team possibly could, and they want him.\n\nNow we enter baseball arcana. The Nats have done more than merely stay on friendly terms. In my view, based on last winter\u2019s free agent market, the Nats now have an inherent advantage over any other team in signing Harper.\n\nBecause the Nats made a one-year qualifying offer to Harper last week, which he naturally rejected, any team that signs Harper as a free agent will be penalized \u2014 fairly severely. Only the Nats avoid such a penalty. How big is this \u201cdraft-pick forfeiture\u201d for signing a free agent who has rejected a qualifying offer? Fortunately for our sanity, all the teams likely to go after Harper are in the same \u201cforfeiture tier.\u201d They would lose their second-highest pick in the 2019 draft and give up $500,000 in international bonus pool money.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of forfeiting.\n\nHow much is such a penalty worth in future lost wins above replacement (WAR) for those players you will never get to draft or sign? Every team\u2019s analytics department would have a different number. But my estimate is that some teams put the career value of those lost players at $25 million to $50 million.\n\nSince 1996, the Nats/Expos\u2019 second-highest picks, who would have been forfeited in such a scenario, include future all-stars Milton Bradley and Brandon Phillips, as well as Drew Storen, Sammy Solis and Andrew Stephenson.\n\nWith international money, the Nats signed Victor Robles for $225,000, while Wilmer Difo, Reynaldo Lopez and Pedro Severino signed for about $100,000 combined. Juan Soto, their second-priciest international signing ever, got $1.5 million.\n\nWhen the final Harper deal gets done, Team X would have to pay more than $250 million in salary while also losing a valuable draft pick and future international players, some of them possible standouts. The Nats would \u201conly\u201d have to fork over the cash. That\u2019s called having an edge.\n\nWho says that civility and mutual respect can\u2019t be newsworthy? Harper and Boras just got their stake in the ground. And the Nats have shown Rendon and future homegrown players that they can play free agency in any of several ways. Like Ryan Zimmerman, they can sign two years early and be set for life with a $100 million extension. Like Jordan Zimmermann and Ian Desmond, they can turn down deals worth more than $100 million a year or two early and take their chances on the direction of their careers. Like Strasburg, they can sign six months early, at a team discount, and have peace of mind in what would otherwise have been their walk year.

But other than simply outbidding the universe, this is the way you maximize the chances that he will.", "Media critic\n\nPresident Trump struck a note of cheer after he arrived at the podium in the White House\u2019s East Room on Wednesday. \u201cIt was a big day, yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cIncredible day. And last night, the Republican Party defied history to expand our Senate majority while significantly beating expectations in the House . . . We did this in spite of a very dramatic fundraising disadvantage . . . and very hostile media coverage, to put it mildly.\u201d He cited a bunch of historical data to shore up the notion that the results of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections provided a grand endorsement of his leadership.\n\n\u201cThe history will really see what a good job we did in the final weeks,\u201d he said.\n\nGiven his exploits on the national political front, Trump might have shown the country a happy and playful demeanor during the prolonged Q-and-A session that followed his predictably self-aggrandizing monologue.\n\nInstead: \u201cI think you should let me run the country, you run CNN and, if you did it well, your ratings would be much better,\u201d said Trump to Jim Acosta, CNN\u2019s chief White House correspondent, who had the nerve to contest the president\u2019s characterization of the caravan of Central American migrants as an \u201cinvasion.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s enough. That\u2019s enough. That\u2019s enough,\u201d he said to Acosta, who was trying to ask a followup on the Russia investigation. A press wrangler attempted to wrest the microphone from Acosta, who maintained his grip on the device.\n\n\u201cCNN should be ashamed of itself, having you working for them,\u201d Trump then said to Acosta. \u201cYou are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn\u2019t be working for CNN. . . . You are a very rude person. The way you treat Sarah [Sanders, the White House press secretary] is horrible and the way you treat other people are horrible.\u201d\n\nIn typical pass-the-buck fashion, the White House found another questioner, Peter Alexander of NBC News. Feeling a need to show some solidarity with Acosta, Alexander vouched for his hard work. \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of yours either, to be honest,\u201d said Trump to Alexander.\n\nAt this point, Acosta stood up again and asked something to the president. \u201cJust sit down, please. When you report fake news, which you do a lot, you are the enemy of the people,\u201d said Trump.\n\nTone, set. Throughout the balance of the nearly 90-minute event, Trump repeatedly berated reporters for asking about his work, as if intent on putting a literal spin on the term \u201cbully pulpit.\u201d When one reporter \u2014 Yamiche Alcindor of PBS NewsHour \u2014 asked about possible racist meaning behind the president\u2019s self-identification as a \u201cnationalist,\u201d Trump scolded, \u201cThat\u2019s such a racist question. . . . You have nationalists, you have globalists. I also love the world. . . . Excuse me, but to say that, what you said, is so insulting to me, it\u2019s a very terrible thing that you said.\u201d\n\nSome \u201cvictory lap.\u201d\n\nWhen Yahoo reporter Hunter Walker asked about reports that the president had made racist remarks, Trump snapped that everyone would know about it if he had. When Walker tried to pose a followup, Trump said, \u201cQuiet, quiet, quiet . . . See, when you talk about division, it\u2019s people like this that cause division.\u201d So Trump asked Walker what news organization he worked for. He said Yahoo. \u201cI hope they\u2019re doing well,\u201d said Trump, not sounding particularly earnest.\n\nSo it went, as Trump presided over the news conference like a poorly trained kindergarten teacher, repeatedly scolding people to sit down or be quiet. CNN found the spectacle sufficiently unseemly as to release this statement:\n\nThis President\u2019s ongoing attacks on the press have gone too far. They are not only dangerous, they are disturbingly un-American. While President Trump has made it clear he does not respect a free press, he has a sworn obligation to protect it. A free press is vital to democracy, and we stand behind Jim Acosta and his fellow journalists everywhere.\n\nAs miserable as he sounded, as awkward as he appeared, as unsettled as he clearly was about losing the House, Trump hung on for question after question. Maybe he enjoyed abusing the assembled reporters. Maybe he had nothing else to do, like watching TV, knowing that the cable news networks were covering this event live. But at one point, he agreed with Yahoo\u2019s Walker that news conferences of this sort are a good thing. \u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018earned media\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s worth billions.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nNot praising Trump enough is now \u2018fake news\u2019\n\nFox News correspondent issues on-air correction related to Trump \u2018fake news\u2019 tweet\n\nCable news networks agree: \u2018The stakes could not be higher\u2019\n\nFox News\u2019s Sean Hannity: Proud to be a Trump operative\n\nWhat took U.S. media orgs so long to realize Trump ad was racist? Or \u2018insensitive\u2019?", "\n\nFrance's Marshal Philippe Petain points as he orders our photographer from the room during the meeting of the Council of Ministers in Vichy, central France, June 9, 1941.(AP)\n\nPARIS \u2014 In France, the name Philippe P\u00e9tain is a synonym for national shame, a stand-in for the darkest chapter in modern French \u2014 and even European \u2014 history.\n\nP\u00e9tain was the leader of France\u2019s Vichy government, the reactionary regime that openly collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II and participated in the deportation of 76,000 Jews during the Holocaust. In the aftermath of the war, he was tried and convicted of treason. Had it not been for his advanced age (was nearly 90 at the time), he would have been executed.\n\nOn Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron came under fire for endorsing the idea that France should pay tribute to P\u00e9tain during a ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the 1918 Armistice that ended World War I. But by the end of the day, amid a torrent of criticism, the \u00c9lys\u00e9e was forced on the defensive, backtracking from the president\u2019s words and asserting that P\u00e9tain would not be honored.\n\nBefore he became head of the Vichy government, P\u00e9tain was a military hero from World War I, having made his name at Verdun, the longest battle of the war. More than 300,000 soldiers \u2014 French and German alike \u2014 died in that battle, one of the bloodiest in the war.\n\n\u201cIt was never part of the plan to honor P\u00e9tain,\u201d an \u00c9lys\u00e9e source told The Washington Post, noting that P\u00e9tain will not be included in a Saturday morning ceremony that will honor other World War I heroes.\n\nBut Macron\u2019s words had suggested otherwise, and set off a national firestorm.\n\n\u201cHe was a great soldier,\u201d Macron said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reality.\u201d P\u00e9tain, Macron had originally suggested, would be recognized along with seven other marshals who led successful military campaigns during the war. Army sources had also told French media that P\u00e9tain was on the list.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s legitimate that we pay homage to the marshals who led the army to victory,\u201d Macron had told reporters.\n\n\u201cPolitical life, like human nature, is sometimes more complex than we would like to believe,\u201d Macron said. \u201cI\u2019ve always looked the history of our country in the face.\u201d\n\nThose remarks outraged Jewish groups and a number of historians, who saw the move in keeping with a recent wave of historical revisionism. It also drew coverage from nearly every major French newspaper and elicited widespread condemnation on social media.\n\nAmong the loudest critics was Macron\u2019s predecessor, former president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who issued a scathing statement on Wednesday night. \u201cHistory does not isolate a single stage, even a glorious military career,\u201d Hollande wrote, in remarks posted on Twitter. \u201cIt judges the immense and unworthy responsibility of a marshal who deliberately used his name and prestige as a cover for treason and the collaboration and deportation of thousands of Jews of France.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only thing I want to remember about P\u00e9tain is that in 1945 he was an incarnation of national shame, which makes him ineligible for any tribute,\u201d said Francis Kalifat, the president of the Representative Council of French Jewish Organizations (CRIF), France\u2019s largest Jewish advocacy group, in a statement.\n\nLate Wednesday, the \u00c9lys\u00e9e backtracked from the president\u2019s initial words in response to the criticism, emphasizing in a slew of social media posts that P\u00e9tain will not, in fact, be honored in a Saturday ceremony. But the affair, however small, reopened a long-standing debate about the wounds of the past.\n\nThe Vichy regime is notorious for having pursued, largely independent of German pressure, its own slew of anti-Semitic legislation in keeping with the \u201cNational Revolution\u201d it sought to inspire.\n\nThe \u201cStatut des Juifs,\u201d passed in two separate junctures in October 1940 and June 1941, banned Jews from public life and the free professions. Vichy also pursued the agenda of \u201cAryanization,\u201d under which French authorities liquidated Jewish property to enrich the coffers of the state.\n\n\n\nGerman Chancellor Adolf Hitler shakes hands with Head of State of Vichy France Marshall Philippe P\u00e9tain, in occupied France, Oct. 24, 1940. Behind center is Paul Schmidt, an interpreter, and on the right is German Minister of Foreign Affairs Joachim Von Ribbentrop. (AP)\n\nIn general, the memory of World War II ranked for decades among the most explosive topics in French public life. For years, admirers \u2014 including former French presidents \u2014 left flowers on P\u00e9tain\u2019s grave every year, on the anniversary of the Armistice.\n\nThat practice came to an abrupt end in 1992, when Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, a Socialist president who had served in the Vichy administration between 1941 and 1943, succumbed to public pressure. In 1995, President Jacques Chirac ended decades of ambiguity by declaring that Vichy was, in fact, the French state and that the deportation of Jews during the war was France\u2019s fault.\n\nIn recent years, however, there has been an attempt to rehabilitate P\u00e9tain, mostly on the extreme right.\n\nThe convicted Holocaust denier and National Front co-founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, for instance, wrote fondly of the wartime leader in a memoir published earlier this year; the right-wing commentator \u00c9ric Zemmour did much the same in a book published in September.\n\nP\u00e9tain, Zemmour wrote, was \u201cdouble-dealing,\u201d somehow attempting to rescue the country and French Jews, from behind the scenes. The vast majority of the Jews deported from France never returned.\n\nThese are no longer fringe opinions: Both Zemmour\u2019s book and Le Pen\u2019s memoirs were instant bestsellers.\n\nFor many, the question is whether Macron\u2019s since retracted decision would somehow endorse a reconsideration of P\u00e9tain. When pressed by journalists, the 40-year-old president went on the defensive immediately. \u201cI\u2019m not hiding any page of history,\u201d he said.\n\nFor some historians, however, the problem is the potential effect of Macron\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the statement comes from the president of the Republic,\u201d said Laurent Joly, an expert in the history of Vichy France and the author of a new book on Vichy anti-Semitism. \u201cIf the army had sought to commemorate P\u00e9tain, no one would have reproached them.\n\n\u201cBut there has been a consensus since 1992. What this does is go back on that consensus. It creates ambiguities,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story originally published on Nov. 7 and was updated on Nov. 8 to reflect the decision not to honor P\u00e9tain.", "Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned on Wednesday at President Trump\u2019s request, ending the tenure of a beleaguered loyalist whose relationship with the president was ruined when Sessions recused himself from control of the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nIn a letter to Trump, Sessions wrote that he had been \u201chonored to serve as Attorney General\u201d and had \u201cworked to implement the law enforcement agenda based on the rule of law that formed a central part of your campaign for the presidency.\u201d Trump tweeted that Sessions would be replaced on an acting basis by Matthew G. Whitaker, who had been serving as Sessions\u2019s chief of staff.\n\n\u201cWe thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well!\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cA permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date.\u201d\n\n[Read Jeff Sessions\u2019 letter of resignation]\n\nA Justice Department official said Whitaker would assume authority over the special counsel probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election \u2014 though his role will be subject to the normal review process for conflicts. Because Sessions was recused, the special counsel probe had been overseen by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who also has had strained relations with Trump, but is considered safe in his position for the moment. Rosenstein went to the White House on Wednesday afternoon for what an official said was a pre-scheduled meeting.\n\nThough Sessions\u2019s removal was long expected, the installation of Whitaker sparked fears that the president might be trying to exert control over the special counsel investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nA legal commentator before he came into the Justice Department, Whitaker had mused publicly about how a Sessions replacement might reduce Mueller\u2019s budget \u201cso low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\u201d He also wrote in an August 2017 column that Mueller had \u201ccome up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing,\u201d after CNN reported that the special counsel could be looking into Trump and his associates\u2019 financial ties to Russia. Trump has told advisers that Whitaker is loyal and would not have recused himself from the investigation, current and former White House officials said.\n\n[Sessions\u2019s law enforcement legacy overshadowed by Trump\u2019s fury]\n\nWhitaker said in a statement: \u201cIt is a true honor that the President has confidence in my ability to lead the Department of Justice as Acting Attorney General. I am committed to leading a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans.\u201d\n\nDemocrats and others issued statements Wednesday urging that Mueller be left to do his work and vowing to investigate whether Sessions\u2019s ouster was meant to interfere with the special counsel. Come January, Democrats will have subpoena power, having won control of the House in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.\n\n\u201cCongress must now investigate the real reason for this termination, confirm that Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker is recused from all aspects of the Special Counsel\u2019s probe, and ensure that the Department of Justice safeguards the integrity of the Mueller investigation,\u201d Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement.\n\nSen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement: \u201cNo one is above the law and any effort to interfere with the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation would be a gross abuse of power by the President. While the President may have the authority to replace the Attorney General, this must not be the first step in an attempt to impede, obstruct or end the Mueller investigation.\u201d\n\nSenator-elect Mitt Romney (R-Utah) tweeted that it was \u201cimperative\u201d Mueller\u2019s work be allowed to continue \u201cunimpeded.\u201d Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said that \u201cno new Attorney General can be confirmed who will stop that investigation.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the special counsel\u2019s office declined to comment.\n\n[Sessions\u2019s ouster throws future of special counsel probe into question]\n\nA person close to Sessions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be frank, said the attorney general shared the president\u2019s frustration with the pace of the Russia inquiry and wished that it had been completed. But Sessions also thought that by staying in the job, he had protected the investigation\u2019s integrity, the person said. In the long run, Sessions is convinced that the country will be better served by the investigation proceeding naturally, as the findings will be more credible to the American public, the person said.\n\nJustice Department officials had been bracing for Sessions\u2019s ouster. Sessions told confidants earlier this week that he expected Trump to fire him or push him out soon after the midterm elections, and friends urged him to quit and consider running again for a Senate seat in Alabama. A person close to Sessions said he is considering doing so. Still, some senior leaders at the Justice Department were shocked to hear the news Wednesday.\n\nSessions received a phone call Wednesday morning from White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly \u2014 before the president held a news conference to discuss the results of the midterm elections \u2014 telling him the president wanted Sessions to resign, an administration official said.\n\nSessions sought to stay on the job at least until the end of the week, according to people familiar with the discussion. Kelly rejected that suggestion, insisting Wednesday would be Sessions\u2019s last day, the people said. Sessions canceled meetings and scheduled one for later in the day, where he would say goodbye to his staff.\n\nA White House official said that Trump had been held at bay until after the elections in demanding Sessions\u2019s resignation but that the president talked eagerly about ousting his attorney general as soon as the votes were tallied. Even as election results were coming in, Trump complained about Sessions and said he hoped Republicans would win a large enough margin in the Senate that he could fire the attorney general quickly, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nAnother person said other Cabinet officials also were in jeopardy.\n\nIn a matter of hours, Sessions was out and Whitaker was in. About 150 employees gathered in the Justice Department courtyard Wednesday evening to bid farewell to the attorney general. Sessions walked out of the building flanked by Rosenstein; Solicitor General Noel Francisco; Jody Hunt, his former chief of staff; and Whitaker. He shook hands with the four, waved to the crowd and gave a thumbs up before climbing into a black government SUV and leaving.\n\nThe White House official said the president liked Whitaker, who was a \u201cbackslapping, football kind of guy\u201d who had briefed Trump on many occasions because the president preferred not to talk to Sessions.\n\n\u201cThe president never wanted to see Jeff. So a lot of other people at DOJ got to see the president,\u201d the person said.\n\nWhitaker, a former U.S. attorney who ran an unsuccessful campaign for a Senate seat in Iowa, played college football at the University of Iowa. In 2014, he chaired the campaign of Sam Clovis, a Republican candidate for Iowa state treasurer. That might present another potential ethics complication for Whitaker\u2019s supervision of the special counsel; Clovis went on to work as a Trump campaign adviser and has become a witness in Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nJustice Department officials said Whitaker will follow the regular process for reviewing possible ethical conflicts as he assumes the new job of the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official. That process involves Justice Department ethics lawyers reviewing an official\u2019s past work to see if there are any financial or personal conflicts that preclude the official from being involved in specific cases.\n\nThe Justice Department advises employees that \u201cgenerally, an employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any matter in which her impartiality could be questioned.\u201d The department\u2019s regulations prohibit a Justice Department employee, \u201cwithout written authorization, from participating in a criminal investigation or prosecution if he has a personal or political relationship with any person or organization substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of the investigation or prosecution.\u201d\n\nTwo close Trump advisers said the president does not plan on keeping Whitaker permanently. Among those said to be under consideration for the job are Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, former U.S. attorney general Bill Barr and former federal judges Janice Rogers Brown and J. Michael Luttig. An administration official said the president has also considered selecting another U.S. senator for the position, on the grounds that a lawmaker might have an easier confirmation, but so far GOP lawmakers have privately expressed little interest in the position.\n\nTwo other officials said former New Jersey governor Chris Christie (R) might be under consideration. One said Christie has talked with the president about the job.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see him staying,\u201d one Trump aide said of Whitaker. \u201cI think the president will be a lot more deliberate in interviewing potential replacements for Jeff Sessions.\u201d\n\nSessions, 71, was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trump, and in many ways he had been the biggest supporter of the president\u2019s policies on immigration, crime and law enforcement.\n\n[While eyes are on Russia, Sessions dramatically reshapes the Justice Department]\n\nBut all of those areas of agreement were overshadowed by the Russia investigation \u2014 specifically, Sessions\u2019s recusal from the inquiry after it was revealed that he had met more than once with the Russian ambassador to the United States during the 2016 campaign, even though he had said during his confirmation hearing that he had not met with any Russians.\n\nTrump has never forgiven Sessions for his recusal, which he regarded as an act of disloyalty that denied him the protection he thought he deserved from his attorney general. \u201cI don\u2019t have an attorney general,\u201d he said in September.\n\nPrivately, Trump has derided Sessions as \u201cMr. Magoo,\u201d a cartoon character who is elderly, myopic and bumbling, according to people with whom the president has spoken.\n\nTrump also had repeatedly threatened or demanded Sessions\u2019s ouster behind closed doors, only to be convinced by aides that removing him could provoke a political crisis within the Republican Party. Former White House counsel Donald McGahn urged the president to keep Sessions in the job until the Mueller probe was over, current and former White House officials said.\n\nAfter an early confrontation, Sessions gave Trump a resignation letter and let him hold onto it. The move deeply concerned White House aides, including then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who told Sessions that Trump would use the letter to manipulate him.\n\n\u201cYou have to get that letter back,\u201d Priebus told Sessions, according to people familiar with the conversation. Trump ultimately returned the missive with a short handwritten note about how he was not accepting it.\n\nAs the president railed against Sessions through early and mid-2017, Republican senators publicly and privately defended the attorney general. But in recent months, some of Sessions\u2019s most prominent defenders, including Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), said they were open to a new attorney general after the midterm elections.\n\nGrassley said in a statement Wednesday that Sessions\u2019s \u201cleadership, integrity and dedication to our country as Attorney General are admirable and commendable.\u201d He added of Whitaker: \u201cThe Justice Department is in good hands during this time of transition.\u201d\n\nDespite the tension with the White House, Sessions had described the position of top law enforcement officer as his dream job, and he pursued his conservative agenda with gusto. But he also had to live with sometimes humiliating attacks from a president he couldn\u2019t seem to please and the suspicions of career staff members who feared the politicization of a Justice Department that prides itself on its independence.\n\nDepartment veterans have expressed concerns that Trump\u2019s repeated public attacks on Sessions, the Justice Department and the FBI could cause lasting damage to federal law enforcement.\n\nMueller is looking into Trump\u2019s statements seeking to fire Sessions or force his resignation in an effort to determine whether those acts are part of a pattern of attempted obstruction of justice, according to people close to the investigation.\n\nEarlier this year, Mueller\u2019s team questioned witnesses about Trump\u2019s private comments and state of mind in late July and early August of last year, around the time he belittled his \u201cbeleaguered\u201d attorney general on Twitter, these people said. The questions sought to determine whether the president\u2019s goal was to oust Sessions so he could replace him with someone who would take control of the investigation, these people said.\n\nSessions usuallydid not respond to the president\u2019s criticism \u2014 including in his resignation letter, which thanked Trump for the \u201copportunity\u201d to serve as attorney general \u2014 but he has at times pushed back.\n\nAfter one particularly blistering tweet in February \u2014 in which the president said Sessions\u2019s actions were \u201cDISGRACEFUL!\u201d \u2014 he issued a statement: \u201cAs long as I am the Attorney General, I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor, and this Department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and Constitution.\u2019\u2019\n\nCarol D.

But Tuesday\u2019s elections indicated that some political antibodies are strengthening the nation\u2019s immune system.\n\nTuesday was, on balance, deflating to Democrats, who learned \u2014 or perhaps not \u2014 that despising this president, although understandable, is insufficient. His comportment cost his congressional party only slightly more than half the carnage that President Barack Obama\u2019s party suffered in the middle of his first term.\n\nThe GOP depressingly ends 2018 more ideologically homogenous than it has been for 11 decades.

So, when the 116th Congress adjourns in autumn 2020, the nation will have completed 40 years in which one party controlled the presidency and Congress for only 10. Tuesday\u2019s results refuted two tiresome and shopworn axioms: Americans \u201cvote their pocketbooks,\u201d and \u201call politics is local.\u201d This year, Americans voted their competing national aversions, some against the president\u2019s palaver, others against those he baited into carpet-chewing tantrums.\n\nAmerica\u2019s political dyspepsia produced 2018\u2019s surge in midterm voting, which should, but won\u2019t, sober those Pollyannas who insist that high turnouts indicate civic health.

As of Wednesday he received 48.3 percent of the vote, and his cable-television groupies, impervious to discouragement, instantly segued to speculation about his possible presidential candidacy.\n\nTuesday\u2019s winners included the Affordable Care Act. Referendums in three crimson states \u2014 Idaho, Utah, Nebraska \u2014 mandated Medicaid expansion (Nebraska\u2019s legislature had rejected it six times), which is Obamacare\u2019s arrhythmic heart. And Republican candidates everywhere genuflected at this altar: Preexisting conditions shall not preclude access to health insurance. Now, however, many Democrats, artists of self-destruction, might forfeit the health-care ground they have gained: The 157 million Americans content with their employer-provided health insurance will rightly hear menace in Medicare-for-all.\n\nIf House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the villain in more than 61,000 Republican ads, is elected House speaker, she will be the first since Sam Rayburn in 1955 to regain that post after yielding it. If she is not elected by House Democrats, who are indebted to her tactical canniness and prodigious fundraising, they will deserve the Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg Trophy: He was the Austrian prime minister who, when Russia sought reciprocal assistance after helping Austria suppress unrest, replied that Austria would astound the world with its ingratitude.\n\nHaving strengthened their grip on the Senate, Republicans, who two years hence will be defending 21 seats (Democrats only 12), increased the chance that if they lose the presidency in 2020, they can impede or modify Democratic initiatives. Meanwhile, the Republican Senate can continue staffing federal courts and being what it has been while Republicans controlled the House: the graveyard of House initiatives.

Whitaker, who had been serving as Sessions\u2019s chief of staff.\n\n\u201cWe thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well!\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cA permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date.\u201d\n\n[Read Jeff Sessions\u2019 letter of resignation]\n\nA Justice Department official said Whitaker would assume authority over the special counsel probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election \u2014 though his role will be subject to the normal review process for conflicts. Because Sessions was recused, the special counsel probe had been overseen by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who also has had strained relations with Trump, but is considered safe in his position for the moment. Rosenstein went to the White House on Wednesday afternoon for what an official said was a pre-scheduled meeting.\n\nThough Sessions\u2019s removal was long expected, the installation of Whitaker sparked fears that the president might be trying to exert control over the special counsel investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nA legal commentator before he came into the Justice Department, Whitaker had mused publicly about how a Sessions replacement might reduce Mueller\u2019s budget \u201cso low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\u201d He also wrote in an August 2017 column that Mueller had \u201ccome up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing,\u201d after CNN reported that the special counsel could be looking into Trump and his associates\u2019 financial ties to Russia. Trump has told advisers that Whitaker is loyal and would not have recused himself from the investigation, current and former White House officials said.\n\n[Sessions\u2019s law enforcement legacy overshadowed by Trump\u2019s fury]\n\nWhitaker said in a statement: \u201cIt is a true honor that the President has confidence in my ability to lead the Department of Justice as Acting Attorney General. I am committed to leading a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans.\u201d\n\nDemocrats and others issued statements Wednesday urging that Mueller be left to do his work and vowing to investigate whether Sessions\u2019s ouster was meant to interfere with the special counsel. Come January, Democrats will have subpoena power, having won control of the House in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.\n\n\u201cCongress must now investigate the real reason for this termination, confirm that Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker is recused from all aspects of the Special Counsel\u2019s probe, and ensure that the Department of Justice safeguards the integrity of the Mueller investigation,\u201d Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement.\n\nSen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement: \u201cNo one is above the law and any effort to interfere with the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation would be a gross abuse of power by the President. While the President may have the authority to replace the Attorney General, this must not be the first step in an attempt to impede, obstruct or end the Mueller investigation.\u201d\n\nSenator-elect Mitt Romney (R-Utah) tweeted that it was \u201cimperative\u201d Mueller\u2019s work be allowed to continue \u201cunimpeded.\u201d Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said that \u201cno new Attorney General can be confirmed who will stop that investigation.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the special counsel\u2019s office declined to comment.\n\n[Sessions\u2019s ouster throws future of special counsel probe into question]\n\nA person close to Sessions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be frank, said the attorney general shared the president\u2019s frustration with the pace of the Russia inquiry and wished that it had been completed. But Sessions also thought that by staying in the job, he had protected the investigation\u2019s integrity, the person said. In the long run, Sessions is convinced that the country will be better served by the investigation proceeding naturally, as the findings will be more credible to the American public, the person said.\n\nJustice Department officials had been bracing for Sessions\u2019s ouster. Sessions told confidants earlier this week that he expected Trump to fire him or push him out soon after the midterm elections, and friends urged him to quit and consider running again for a Senate seat in Alabama. A person close to Sessions said he is considering doing so. Still, some senior leaders at the Justice Department were shocked to hear the news Wednesday.\n\nSessions received a phone call Wednesday morning from White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly \u2014 before the president held a news conference to discuss the results of the midterm elections \u2014 telling him the president wanted Sessions to resign, an administration official said.\n\nSessions sought to stay on the job at least until the end of the week, according to people familiar with the discussion. Kelly rejected that suggestion, insisting Wednesday would be Sessions\u2019s last day, the people said. Sessions canceled meetings and scheduled one for later in the day, where he would say goodbye to his staff.\n\nA White House official said that Trump had been held at bay until after the elections in demanding Sessions\u2019s resignation but that the president talked eagerly about ousting his attorney general as soon as the votes were tallied. Even as election results were coming in, Trump complained about Sessions and said he hoped Republicans would win a large enough margin in the Senate that he could fire the attorney general quickly, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nAnother person said other Cabinet officials also were in jeopardy.\n\nIn a matter of hours, Sessions was out and Whitaker was in. About 150 employees gathered in the Justice Department courtyard Wednesday evening to bid farewell to the attorney general. Sessions walked out of the building flanked by Rosenstein; Solicitor General Noel Francisco; Jody Hunt, his former chief of staff; and Whitaker. He shook hands with the four, waved to the crowd and gave a thumbs up before climbing into a black government SUV and leaving.\n\nThe White House official said the president liked Whitaker, who was a \u201cbackslapping, football kind of guy\u201d who had briefed Trump on many occasions because the president preferred not to talk to Sessions.\n\n\u201cThe president never wanted to see Jeff. So a lot of other people at DOJ got to see the president,\u201d the person said.\n\nWhitaker, a former U.S. attorney who ran an unsuccessful campaign for a Senate seat in Iowa, played college football at the University of Iowa. In 2014, he chaired the campaign of Sam Clovis, a Republican candidate for Iowa state treasurer. That might present another potential ethics complication for Whitaker\u2019s supervision of the special counsel; Clovis went on to work as a Trump campaign adviser and has become a witness in Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nJustice Department officials said Whitaker will follow the regular process for reviewing possible ethical conflicts as he assumes the new job of the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official. That process involves Justice Department ethics lawyers reviewing an official\u2019s past work to see if there are any financial or personal conflicts that preclude the official from being involved in specific cases.\n\nThe Justice Department advises employees that \u201cgenerally, an employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any matter in which her impartiality could be questioned.\u201d The department\u2019s regulations prohibit a Justice Department employee, \u201cwithout written authorization, from participating in a criminal investigation or prosecution if he has a personal or political relationship with any person or organization substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of the investigation or prosecution.\u201d\n\nTwo close Trump advisers said the president does not plan on keeping Whitaker permanently. Among those said to be under consideration for the job are Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, former U.S. attorney general Bill Barr and former federal judges Janice Rogers Brown and J. Michael Luttig. An administration official said the president has also considered selecting another U.S. senator for the position, on the grounds that a lawmaker might have an easier confirmation, but so far GOP lawmakers have privately expressed little interest in the position.\n\nTwo other officials said former New Jersey governor Chris Christie (R) might be under consideration. One said Christie has talked with the president about the job.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see him staying,\u201d one Trump aide said of Whitaker. \u201cI think the president will be a lot more deliberate in interviewing potential replacements for Jeff Sessions.\u201d\n\nSessions, 71, was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trump, and in many ways he had been the biggest supporter of the president\u2019s policies on immigration, crime and law enforcement.\n\n[While eyes are on Russia, Sessions dramatically reshapes the Justice Department]\n\nBut all of those areas of agreement were overshadowed by the Russia investigation \u2014 specifically, Sessions\u2019s recusal from the inquiry after it was revealed that he had met more than once with the Russian ambassador to the United States during the 2016 campaign, even though he had said during his confirmation hearing that he had not met with any Russians.\n\nTrump has never forgiven Sessions for his recusal, which he regarded as an act of disloyalty that denied him the protection he thought he deserved from his attorney general. \u201cI don\u2019t have an attorney general,\u201d he said in September.\n\nPrivately, Trump has derided Sessions as \u201cMr. Magoo,\u201d a cartoon character who is elderly, myopic and bumbling, according to people with whom the president has spoken.\n\nTrump also had repeatedly threatened or demanded Sessions\u2019s ouster behind closed doors, only to be convinced by aides that removing him could provoke a political crisis within the Republican Party. Former White House counsel Donald McGahn urged the president to keep Sessions in the job until the Mueller probe was over, current and former White House officials said.\n\nAfter an early confrontation, Sessions gave Trump a resignation letter and let him hold onto it. The move deeply concerned White House aides, including then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who told Sessions that Trump would use the letter to manipulate him.\n\n\u201cYou have to get that letter back,\u201d Priebus told Sessions, according to people familiar with the conversation. Trump ultimately returned the missive with a short handwritten note about how he was not accepting it.\n\nAs the president railed against Sessions through early and mid-2017, Republican senators publicly and privately defended the attorney general. But in recent months, some of Sessions\u2019s most prominent defenders, including Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), said they were open to a new attorney general after the midterm elections.\n\nGrassley said in a statement Wednesday that Sessions\u2019s \u201cleadership, integrity and dedication to our country as Attorney General are admirable and commendable.\u201d He added of Whitaker: \u201cThe Justice Department is in good hands during this time of transition.\u201d\n\nDespite the tension with the White House, Sessions had described the position of top law enforcement officer as his dream job, and he pursued his conservative agenda with gusto. But he also had to live with sometimes humiliating attacks from a president he couldn\u2019t seem to please and the suspicions of career staff members who feared the politicization of a Justice Department that prides itself on its independence.\n\nDepartment veterans have expressed concerns that Trump\u2019s repeated public attacks on Sessions, the Justice Department and the FBI could cause lasting damage to federal law enforcement.\n\nMueller is looking into Trump\u2019s statements seeking to fire Sessions or force his resignation in an effort to determine whether those acts are part of a pattern of attempted obstruction of justice, according to people close to the investigation.\n\nEarlier this year, Mueller\u2019s team questioned witnesses about Trump\u2019s private comments and state of mind in late July and early August of last year, around the time he belittled his \u201cbeleaguered\u201d attorney general on Twitter, these people said. The questions sought to determine whether the president\u2019s goal was to oust Sessions so he could replace him with someone who would take control of the investigation, these people said.\n\nSessions usuallydid not respond to the president\u2019s criticism \u2014 including in his resignation letter, which thanked Trump for the \u201copportunity\u201d to serve as attorney general \u2014 but he has at times pushed back.\n\nAfter one particularly blistering tweet in February \u2014 in which the president said Sessions\u2019s actions were \u201cDISGRACEFUL!\u201d \u2014 he issued a statement: \u201cAs long as I am the Attorney General, I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor, and this Department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and Constitution.\u2019\u2019\n\nCarol D.

And on Wednesday, Sessions resigned at Trump\u2019s request.\n\n[Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigns at Trump\u2019s request]\n\nBy the time Trump declared in September, \u201cI don\u2019t have an attorney general,\u201d even his torturous relationship with Sessions had become a subject of scrutiny for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Specifically, Mueller has examined whether Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Sessions into resigning in 2017 might have amounted to an attempt to obstruct justice.\n\nSessions has said publicly and privately that he does not regret the recusal, believing it was the right course of action. According to a person familiar with Sessions\u2019s thinking, he has shared the president\u2019s frustration with the pace of the Mueller probe and would like it to be finished, but also feels that it is important for the country that the investigation continue unimpeded, so that its final results are accepted by the public.\n\nSessions also believes that even though he did not oversee the Russia probe, he played a positive role at the Justice Department, shielding that probe from political interference, even as his boss publicly scorned him, this person said.\n\nAs much as the shadow of the Russia probe has loomed over Sessions\u2019s tenure as attorney general, he has sought to make his time in the job about more than that \u2014 a return, as he calls it, to the principles of pro-police, anti-illegal-immigration law enforcement.\n\nIn May, standing before a sparkling Pacific Ocean and a looming border fence, Sessions emphasized his vision for America.\n\n\u201cToday we\u2019re here to send a message to the world that we are not going to let the country be overwhelmed,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cPeople are not going to caravan or otherwise stampede our border . . .

And that child may be separated from you as required by law.\u201d\n\n\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions stands near a border fence in Las Cruces, N.M., in April. (Hayne Palmour IV/AP)\n\n[Sessions says Justice Department will prosecute every person who crosses the border unlawfully]\n\nWhile the family-separation policy pursued by the administration has been shelved, at least for now, the broader set of immigration actions pursued by Sessions became a central argument for Trump and the Republicans as they sought to retain control of Congress.\n\nAvideh Moussavian, legislative director at the National Immigration Law Center, said Sessions \u201ccame in with a very strong anti-immigrant ideology, and a very deeply ingrained world view that is rooted in exclusion.\u201d\n\nThrough his directive that prosecutors bring cases against anyone who crosses the border illegally, his defenses of Trump\u2019s ban of travelers from certain majority-Muslim countries and his family separation policy, his effort to end an Obama-era program granting reprieves from deportation to people who had come here as children without documentation, and his opinions attempting to restrict asylum, Sessions has \u201cdemonstrated a willingness to radically transform our immigration system in ways that run around Congress and are sort of death by a thousand cuts, if you will,\u201d Moussavian said.\n\n\u201cI think that he\u2019s trying intentionally to turn the immigration courts into fast-track deportation machines, and to turn immigration judges into mass deportation agents, and limiting their discretion,\u201d Moussavian said.\n\nAs the nation\u2019s highest law enforcement official for 21 months, Sessions will be remembered for remaining loyal to a president who turned virulently against him, even as he pushed Trump\u2019s controversial policies more aggressively than any other member of the Cabinet.\n\n\u201cIn my view, there has never been a Republican attorney general \u2014 a conservative attorney general \u2014 who can be credited with more achievements in advancing the conservative legal policy agenda,\u201d said Charles J. Cooper, Sessions\u2019s longtime friend and attorney and the former assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel under President Ronald Reagan. \u201cWhat he\u2019s managed to accomplish, despite the distractions, has been nothing short of astounding.\u201d\n\nCooper pointed to Sessions\u2019s undoing of Obama-era criminal justice policies, his immigration policies and his push against drug trafficking.\n\n\u201cIn virtually every area of legal policy, he has done exactly what conservatives like me had hoped and expected that he would do,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cBut he\u2019s done it more energetically, more effectively than we could have imagined.\u201d\n\nFormer Attorney General Edwin Meese, who has known Sessions for 33 years, said he has \u201cprobably accomplished as much in two years as a lot of attorneys general have in four.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe restored integrity to the Department of Justice, which was in very bad shape. And he has done a great job in mending relationships with law enforcement, both in the federal government and in state and local law enforcement,\u201d said Meese.\n\nCivil rights activists, however, said Sessions\u2019s actions and rhetoric demonstrated racism and antipathy to civil rights. They point to steps he took to loosen federal protections for African Americans and Latinos, along with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, including restrictions on immigration and the Justice Department\u2019s reversal of Obama administration policies on civil rights, criminal justice, policing and voting.\n\n\u201cSessions has been terrible for civil rights in this country,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, the head of the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division in the Obama administration who is now the chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s turned back the clock from trying to re-create mass incarceration policies, to his view of the voting rights act as intrusive, to his abdication of the mission of the civil rights division on a range of issues including addressing systemic police misconduct, voting rights and LGBTQ rights,\u201d Gupta said.\n\n[While eyes are on Russia, Sessions dramatically reshapes the Justice Department]\n\nAfter a rocky confirmation battle amid charges that he was racially insensitive, Sessions, who had been a senator from Alabama, took the helm of the Justice Department in February 2017 with the full support of Trump, whom he supported for president in early 2016 before any other senator.\n\n\u201cIt is with great pride \u2014 very great pride \u2014 that I say these words to you right now: Attorney General Jeff Sessions, welcome to the White House,\u201d Trump said during Sessions\u2019s swearing-in ceremony in the Oval Office on Feb. 9, 2017. \u201cHe\u2019s a man of integrity, a man of principle and a man of total, utter resolve.\u201d\n\nThose feelings sharply changed just a few weeks later.\n\nTrump became enraged when Sessions held a news conference on March 2 announcing that, upon the advice of ethics lawyers and others at the Justice Department, he was recusing himself from the investigation into possible conspiracy between Russian officials and the Trump administration during the 2016 presidential election. The bond between the two men was shattered.\n\n[For Trump and Sessions, a warm beginning turned into an icy standoff]\n\nFor the rest of Sessions\u2019s tenure, Trump berated and humiliated his attorney general on Twitter and in interviews. He publicly called him \u201cbeleaguered\u201d and \u201cvery weak.\u201d In September, Trump told reporters he was \u201cvery disappointed in Jeff. Very disappointed.\u201d\n\nThrough it all, Sessions continued to speak effusively about the president \u2014 even while he was mocked on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d for his unwavering loyalty \u2014 and moved aggressively to reshape the Justice Department to reflect his hard-line views.\n\nOne of the first actions Sessions took in April 2017 was to order the Justice Department to conduct a sweeping review of all reform agreements \u2014 or consent decrees \u2014 with troubled police departments nationwide, saying it was necessary to ensure that the pacts didn\u2019t work against the Trump administration\u2019s goals of promoting officer safety and morale while fighting violent crime.\n\n[Sessions orders Justice Department to review all police reform agreements]\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very pleased with Attorney General Sessions from Day One,\u201d said Chuck Canterbury, the national president of the Fraternal Order of Police. \u201cHe\u2019s been much more supportive of the law enforcement mission in this country. And officers around the country know it and feel it.\u201d\n\nSessions\u2019s actions regarding police investigations, along with a strong effort to reach out to local police officers whenever he traveled to give speeches, endeared him to law enforcement. He would often say to them, \u201cwe have your backs, and you have our thanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey think extraordinarily highly of him,\u201d said Steven H. Cook, a Justice Department official at the Office of Law Enforcement Affairs. \u201cHe has worked especially hard to reverse the false narrative that law enforcement people are racist, that it\u2019s not an honorable profession. And law enforcement appreciate that support.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese consent decrees, while well-intended, drive a wedge between law enforcement and the community,\u201d Cook said. \u201cWhat they signal is that the United States Department of Justice has said that this department is \u2014 fill in the blank \u2014 racist, abusive. It always casts a shadow over the entire department.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement officials in local communities also point to the aggressive approach Sessions has taken to fighting crime, both with his rhetoric and a string of new initiatives, particularly focused on the country\u2019s opioid crisis. The Justice Department, for example, has tripled its prosecutions of fentanyl cases and last year brought the first cases charging Chinese nationals with selling large quantities of the drug to Americans.\n\nSessions proposed a change to national drug policy by limiting the amount of opioids that companies can manufacture each year. He created a team of agents and analysts to disrupt illicit opioid sales online and started a unit to target opioid-related health-care fraud.\n\n[Sessions targets 10 areas in U.S. for crackdown on the sale of fentanyl]\n\nBut civil rights leaders say they see Sessions\u2019s actions, particularly with regard to agreements reached with police in places like Chicago, as an effort by the Justice Department to walk away from its obligation to ensure that state and local law enforcement agencies nationwide are following the Constitution.\n\n\u201cSessions abandoned the Justice Department\u2019s investigation and duty by law to remedy the findings of systemic police misconduct in the Chicago Police Department,\u201d Gupta said. The Obama administration had opened 25 investigations into law enforcement agencies and had been enforcing 14 consent decrees, along with some other agreements before Sessions became attorney general.\n\nSessions also reversed the charging policy of former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. and in May 2017 directed his federal prosecutors to aggressively target drug traffickers and charge defendants with the most serious, provable crimes. Holder, five years ago, had directed his prosecutors to stop charging low-level, nonviolent drug offenders with offenses that impose severe mandatory minimum sentences.\n\nCivil rights groups, some Republican lawmakers and even the Koch brothers \u2014 major donors to conservative groups and causes \u2014 criticized Sessions\u2019s new policy, saying that he was taking the country backward after there had been a consensus in Congress about criminal justice reform.\n\nBut many prosecutors praised the measure, saying it gave them more tools to do their jobs, which they felt had been taken away in the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThat was huge,\u201d said Cook, a former prosecutor in Tennessee. \u201cIt unhandcuffed prosecutors who were demoralized when they were told not to charge drug traffickers \u2014 even drug traffickers who had large quantities of controlled substances \u2014 with the actual crimes they committed.\u201d\n\nSessions also methodically rolled back Obama administration positions in court cases over voting rights. In the same month that Sessions became attorney general, the Justice Department dropped its long-standing position that Texas intended to discriminate when it passed a strict voter-ID law. And, several months later, the department sided with Ohio in its controversial effort to purge thousands of people from its rolls for not voting in recent elections, a position upheld in a 5-4 decision by the Supreme Court.\n\n[Justice Department reverses position to allow Ohio to purge inactive voters from rolls]\n\n\u201cThere has not been a single case brought by this administration to enforce the Voting Rights Act or to take up the crisis with voter suppression that we are seeing in the country right now, and that is deeply troubling,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the National Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. \u201cWhat we have seen from the Justice Department is the agency reversing course on cases involving the Texas ID law and Ohio\u2019s voter purge program.\u201d\n\nSessions\u2019s defenders, however, point to several cases that illustrate a focus on hate-crimes prosecutions under Sessions. Since January 2017, the Justice Department has indicted 50 people in connection with hate crimes and secured convictions of 51 defendants for hate crimes, according to Justice officials.\n\n\u201cI will acknowledge that the civil rights division has continued to pursue important work in the hate crimes area,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cBut when it comes to voting rights and confronting systemic police misconduct and other areas of the civil rights division, we\u2019ve seen work come to a complete standstill.\u201d", "", "\n\nDan Crenshaw and his wife, Tara, at a campaign event in May. (Mark Mulligan/AP)\n\nDan Crenshaw was not new to the battlefield before an IED explosion tore into his face and claimed his eye in Afghanistan.\n\nThe former Navy SEAL had already seen two combat tours before arriving in volatile Helmand Province in 2012. He stayed in the Navy for four more years after his serious wounds, including two other overseas postings, before leaving the service in 2016.\n\nHis name may be familiar for two reasons. One, his injury was mocked days ago on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d and the joke drew wide condemnation. And second: Crenshaw has entered a new billet as Representative-elect for Texas' 2nd Congressional District.\n\nCrenshaw is part of a wave of veterans elected to office Tuesday, one of at least 77 members elected who will join 15 other veterans in the Senate who were not up for reelection.\n\nWhile the number of veteran lawmakers has declined after World War II and Vietnam, more younger veterans and more women veterans are joining the ranks of Congress \u2014 and advocates have said that they can smooth partisan hysteria and put Washington back to work.\n\nThe military pulverizes individualism and emphasizes teamwork. All succeed or all fail. That may explain data that suggests that veterans are more likely than nonveterans to co-sponsor bipartisan legislation, according to the Lugar Center, a Washington-based nonprofit that tracks congressional behavior.\n\nThe number of veterans elected Tuesday \u201cshows a hunger in the electorate for outsiders, service, and country over party,\u201d said Rye Barcott, chief executive of With Honor, a political action committee focused on electing a bipartisan field of veterans to curb gridlock.\n\n(The group received a $10 million donation in September from Jeffrey P. Bezos, chief executive of Amazon. He also owns The Washington Post.)\n\n[Border Protection is preparing for the caravan \u2014 with weapons and gear designed for combat]\n\nIn the last Congress, 55 percent of veterans in the Senate scored above a two-decade historical average for bipartisanship, up from 43 percent among nonveterans, With Honor found in a study with the Lugar Center.\n\nIn the House, the figures are 43 percent vs. 34 percent, the group said.\n\nVeterans are courted by both parties for another obvious reason \u2014 to blunt their own unpopularity. The military is the most respected institution in the country, Gallup found, with polling for Congress showing dismal numbers.\n\nWith Honor has said veterans made up more than half of Congress in recent decades, but the decline of veterans in Congress has eclipsed the overall dip of veterans in the U.S. population. The Brookings Institution recently found that the number of veteran lawmakers is at 19 percent \u2014 a near-historic low.\n\nWith Honor endorsed 39 candidates who pledged that they would, among other things, meet and work with opposing party members. At least 17 were elected, Barcott told The Washington Post, with seven others too close to call by Wednesday afternoon.\n\nMany veterans who lost their bids overperformed, Barcott said \u2014 like former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath, who lost a tight and bitterly contested race to Republican incumbent Rep. Garland \u201cAndy\u201d Barr in Kentucky\u2019s 6th Congressional District.\n\nFormer helicopter pilot MJ Hegar, a Democratic viral ad star endorsed by With Honor, was also narrowly defeated in Texas\u2019 blood-red 31st Congressional District by GOP Rep. John Carter.\n\nBarcott\u2019s group was pleased overall with the results, which may provide a road map for PACs to boost the profile of veterans, who are disadvantaged from the start for two reasons, he said.\n\nWhile the military draws from many corners of society, most veterans are not as well-heeled and politically connected as their competition. And military service across the world can make it difficult to establish roots in one place.\n\nCrenshaw overcame those obstacles, and perhaps mindful of his pledge, did not shy away from questions over President Trump\u2019s role in divisive rhetoric.\n\n\u201cI would always call for him tone down the rhetoric sometimes and lower the temperature,\u201d he told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cIt would certainly help.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nMidterm elections: Democrats flip House as GOP expands Senate majority\n\n\u2018I have given my life to serve\u2019: Utah mayor and father of seven killed in Afghanistan", "\n\nAndrew Harrer/Bloomberg\n\nOpinion writer\n\nThe results of Tuesday\u2019s Senate elections may have been most notable for how unsurprising they were. Democrats are unhappy to see incumbents from North Dakota, Missouri and Indiana go down, but it wasn\u2019t unexpected given that President Trump won those states by 36 points, 19 points and 19 points respectively.\n\nBut expected or not, the losses could put Democrats in a very difficult position in 2020 and beyond, making it all the more difficult for them to take back the chamber. Which could stand to make the life of a potential President Warren (or President Booker or President Harris or President Whoever) extremely complicated.\n\nThe problem Democrats face is partly structural, of course. The Senate was designed to be undemocratic, and as the country\u2019s population has grown, the problem has only worsened. Today, the fewer than 600,000 people who live in Wyoming get the same two senators as the 40 million who live in California, and because Republicans dominate in more of the sparsely populated states than Democrats, they have a built-in advantage.\n\nIn the current Senate, the sitting Democrats received a total of 15 million more votes in their last elections than the sitting Republicans did, yet the Republicans control the chamber. The situation is so imbalanced that it led Ian Millhiser to write an article with the only slightly tongue-in-cheek headline, \u201cThe Senate is so rigged that Democrats may never control it ever again.\u201d\n\nNever is a long time, of course. But can Democrats take the Senate back any time soon?\n\nLet\u2019s begin by looking at the next election. Final results are not yet in from Tuesday\u2019s races, but if Rick Scott\u2019s apparent victory in Florida is confirmed and Martha McSally holds on to the minuscule lead she clings to in Arizona as the final votes are counted, Republicans will have 54 seats in their majority.\n\nThis year\u2019s map was abysmal for Democrats; they had to defend 26 seats, while Republicans only had to defend nine. In 2020, things will be much more agreeable: Democrats will be defending only 12 seats, while Republicans will have to defend 21.\n\nBut most of those seats won\u2019t be particularly competitive. Democrats have little realistic chance of winning seats in Idaho or Oklahoma. By my count, however, there are at least eight states where Democrats have at least a shot to win a seat held by a Republican, and I would put four of those states into the category of \u201calmost guaranteed to be battlegrounds\u201d (Colorado, Georgia, Maine and North Carolina). Republicans also have a few states where they have a shot at taking a seat from a Democrat, particularly Alabama, where Doug Jones will be up for reelection and most likely won\u2019t have the benefit of running against an accused pedophile (though you never know).\n\nIt\u2019s far too early to tell what that election will be like, but just looking at the map, one can say that Democrats will have a chance to win the net of four seats they will need to get to 50-50 (with ties being broken by the vice president if they win the presidency) or more, but it will require nearly everything to go right.\n\nOf course, sometimes nearly everything does go right. It\u2019s not uncommon for one party to win every or nearly every highly contested Senate race in a given election. That is what happened to Democrats in 2008, which enabled them to (briefly) have the 60-vote majority they needed to pass the Affordable Care Act, without a vote to spare. Republicans had a similar sweep six years later when all those senators were up for reelection.\n\nSo you could imagine a situation in which 2020 is a great election for Democrats, their presidential candidate defeats Trump, they hold the House, and they narrowly take the Senate. That would mean, however, that the new Democratic president would be unable to pass any major legislation outside of the reconciliation process, severely limiting what they could do in the face of guaranteed Republican obstructionism. Despite all the powers the presidency offers, some things \u2014 such as instituting universal health coverage \u2014 would probably be impossible.\n\nThen two years later, that Democratic president would face a midterm election. Once again, the map would heavily favor the Democrats, with nearly twice as many Republicans up for reelection, including many in swing states. But given the fact that the president\u2019s party usually fares poorly in that first midterm, there would be a serious chance that Democrats could lose the Senate entirely.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty as we look this far ahead. What we can say is that it\u2019s almost impossible to foresee a time in the near future when Democrats have even the faintest hope at having the presidency along with another 60-seat majority in the Senate, which is what it would take to pass ambitious legislation. What\u2019s far more likely is a situation in which a Democratic president faces a Republican Senate.\n\nUnless, of course, we do something like finally allow the District of Columbia to become a state and give full voting rights to the 700,000 Americans who live there. Which we should have done a long time ago.\n\nRelated:\n\nRead more:\n\nDana Milbank: America steps back from the abyss\n\nRonald A.

(Brandon Wade/AP)\n\nFor Stephen A. Smith, the Wizards\u2019 119-100 loss to the Mavericks on Tuesday was the final straw. The ESPN personality has now seen enough of this year\u2019s team, which closely resembles the outfit he said was \u201clooking like straight garbage\u201d last January, to know that it\u2019s time to empty the trash can.\n\nOn Wednesday\u2019s episode of \u201cFirst Take,\u201d Smith offered animated criticism of Wizards Coach Scott Brooks and point guard John Wall while joining the chorus of pundits calling for Washington to start over and rebuild. There was a lot of yelling involved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for a blowup,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work, Ernie Grunfeld. It didn\u2019t work . . . This conversation hurts me, because Ernie Grunfeld and I go back to his days with the Knicks. I\u2019ve known this man for over 25 years, I love that man. But this is a disgrace taking place in the nation\u2019s capital. People have their opinion of a negative around here about what else goes on in the nation\u2019s capital. Thank God they didn\u2019t contaminate themselves further by going over to the damn Verizon Center. What a disgrace that is taking place in the nation\u2019s capital! Scott Brooks? Gotta go! Gotta go! And listen, let me be very clear: I\u2019ve known Scott Brooks, like him. I\u2019m not trying to say he can\u2019t coach. He is not the right man for this job. This job requires a heavy hammer. Scott Brooks is one of the nicest guys you could ever meet. The problem with that is, unfortunately, you don\u2019t like confrontation. And with the Wizards, you need confrontation.\u201d\n\nCoincidentally, during his weekly appearance with the Sports Junkies on 106.7 The Fan, the mild-mannered Brooks was asked about his ability to \u201cplay the bad cop\u201d with his players when necessary.\n\n[In almost any other NBA city, Scott Brooks would have to worry about his job. Not in D.C.]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a players\u2019s league, but it\u2019s an effort league,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cIf you want to have a good team, you gotta play with great effort. You can\u2019t coach the players like you would be coaching college. You can\u2019t coach the players like I was coached in the \u201980s or \u201990s. It\u2019s a different way of doing things. You have to be able to get through to guys, but you gotta have the right guys being able to do it, too. You have to have guys that are committed to doing it, too. If you have that, then your job becomes to really coach the technical side of things. We have to give better defensive effort. I have to do a better job of making sure we are into the game plan.\u201d\n\nBrooks added that while he\u2019s \u201cnot one to embarrass anybody publicly,\u201d he will point things out privately, and it occasionally \u201cgets a little ugly\u201d behind closed doors. Ugly hardly begins to describe the 2-8 Wizards, three weeks into the season. Smith rattled off some of the team\u2019s worst numbers on \u201cFirst Take,\u201d including their negative-10.3 average point differential and last-place ranking in rebounding.\n\n\u201cBut it gets worse,\u201d Smith continued. \u201cI\u2019ve got John Wall\u2019s contract right here, and let me give a shout out to Rich Paul, because he deserves props for this. There\u2019s nothing better than an agent that gets you your money when it looks like you don\u2019t deserve it. Now let\u2019s be clear: John Wall signed a four-year \u2018supermax\u2019 deal for $169.3 million. It hasn\u2019t even kicked in yet. He\u2019s getting paid $37.8 next year, $40.8 the year after, $43.8 million the year after and then has a player option \u2014 A PLAYER OPTION! \u2014 of $46.9 million. Now listen, I like John Wall. John Wall is an all-star. John Wall can play. Then this year arrives. For some reason, a man that struggles with his perimeter shooting [is now] shooting worse. He can\u2019t get to the hole with the ease that he used to. He\u2019s actually bigger! He looks out of shape, and that\u2019s a problem! So now you got that as a problem, then you got him and [Bradley] Beal and not meshing as a problem. It\u2019s contaminated Markieff Morris, who can play! Otto Porter, he looks comatose half the damn time! And oh by the way, he\u2019s in the midst of a $[106] million contract!\u201d\n\nBy this point, an exasperated Smith looked like he had just been forced to sit through a compilation of the Wizards' Top 100 worst defensive lapses of the season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not questioning John Wall\u2019s abilities,\u201d Smith said moments later. \u201cI\u2019m questioning his level of production. It ain\u2019t just your job to score; it\u2019s your job to lead. To lead. They have no leadership, they have no chemistry, they don\u2019t even look like they want to play together. Don\u2019t get me started with hanging out together, because damn sure if I\u2019ve seen it, and I\u2019m in the nation\u2019s capital enough. Trust me. If they were doing it, I\u2019d know. Otto Porter looks comatose. Markieff Morris isn\u2019t playing up to snuff, and that has a lot to do with your point guard and your lack of leadership. And it\u2019s bad enough that you got the \u2018supermax\u2019 deal, but it hasn\u2019t even kicked in yet. The nation\u2019s capital, when it comes to the sport of basketball, fresh off a Stanley Cup championship in hockey, [has] absolutely, positively nothing to look forward to. This situation is an abomination, it has to change, and unfortunately you can\u2019t trade Wall because of the contract that I just gave you, which means that Bradley Beal is your one commodity that\u2019s movable.\u201d\n\nDespite the Wizards' poor start, Brooks is unlikely to be fired for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the guaranteed $21 million still remaining on his contract. During Wednesday\u2019s interview with the Junkies, Brooks was asked if he\u2019s happy with the leadership the Wizards' big-money players are showing on the court.\n\n\u201cIt all starts with me,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with myself right now, and I\u2019m not happy with how we\u2019re playing. John is definitely not, and Brad is definitely not, and Otto is definitely not happy with where we are right now. We\u2019re 2-8, we\u2019ve been here before a couple years ago, we\u2019re exactly in the exact same spot \u2014 2-8. Can we turn it around? Absolutely. But we\u2019re not gonna turn it around by hoping. We\u2019ve got to turn it around with great effort on the defensive end. Sometimes last night, we were hoping that [Dallas] would miss shots. When you hope, you never have the success you need. You need to make them miss.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Wizards:\n\nThe Wizards are too slow to pick up their pace in loss to Mavericks\n\nDwight Howard is seeking to save the Wizards' season with smiles and good vibes\n\nAdam Silver has concern when teams spend unprofitably\n\nCapital City Go-Go thump to their own beat in G League debut\n\nThe Wizards were supposed to be building something.

(Samsung)\n\nFlip phone, we hardly knew ye.\n\nSamsung Electronics on Wednesday offered a peek at a future phone that unfolds like a book to reveal a 7.3-inch screen inside. Part pocket-size flip phone, part tablet, it\u2019s the most interesting idea I\u2019ve seen in smartphone design for years.\n\nYou have to see it to believe it \u2014 and unfortunately we only got a tease. We think of a smartphone screen as a rigid piece of glass that\u2019s limited by the size of the device itself. But Samsung\u2019s Infinity Flex Display folds, unfolds and refolds to pack up into a smaller form.\n\nThis origami screen is bound for a big phone launch, but Samsung didn\u2019t offer a name, price or even a timeline other than 2019. The Korean electronics giant showed the new display technology at its annual San Francisco developer conference in the hopes of wooing app makers to create experiences that take advantage of it.\n\nIn an interview, the CEO of Samsung\u2019s mobile division, DJ Koh, told me the folding phone is no gimmick. \u201cIn terms of productivity, always a bigger screen is better,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we made a much bigger screen than the Note, then it would become a tablet. So why don\u2019t we think about folding? We started from this simple idea three or four years ago.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt its developer conference in San Francisco, Samsung showed this computer-generated rendering of its folding-screen phone design. (Samsung)\n\nFolded up, the device has a screen on its front. When opened, the interior screen lays flat \u2014 with little hint of a crease \u2014 to show a widescreen version of whatever app had been previously running on the front.\n\nHow\u2019d they make the screen fold flat? Koh said Samsung has had bendable OLED screens for years, but they\u2019ve been fixed behind glass. The folding phone\u2019s interior screen uses a different kind of composite polymer transparent material that can withstand being opened or closed at least 300,000 times. We\u2019ll have to see how it wears in real-world use.\n\nIt\u2019s about time for something new in phones. Samsung helped create the big-phone trend that\u2019s become the standard with devices such as Apple\u2019s iPhone XS Max. But across the industry, smartphone designs have been more about incremental improvements than bold new ideas \u2014 and consumers, unsurprisingly, have waited longer and longer to upgrade.\n\n\n\nJustin Denison, senior vice president of Samsung Electronics America, speaks while holding the new Infinity Flex screenat the Samsung Developers Conference in San Francisco. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg)\n\nChinese telecom giant Huawei has also teased that it is working on a folding phone that could replace a computer.\n\nWhat will we do with that big screen? Koh has a few ideas \u2014 such as play games, watch video and multitask with up to three open apps \u2014 but realizes Samsung needs software and user experience help make the new kind of phone useful before it goes on sale. \u201cWe cannot make it happen on our own,\u201d he said.\n\nSamsung also sought help from Google, whose Android software powers the phone and will need to be tweaked to take advantage of it. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of challenges we need to overcome together,\u201d Koh said.\n\nThe collaborative approach also makes Samsung different from Apple, which usually keeps unfinished new technologies under wraps. \u201cIt\u2019s a blank canvas for us to create something together,\u201d said Justin Denison, a senior vice president for Samsung Electronics America.", "\n\n(Illustration by Christopher Ingraham for the Washington Post)\n\nOn Tuesday night Democrats set themselves up for greater control over the 2020 congressional redistricting process after making gains in state legislatures and governor\u2019s mansions across the country. But Republicans remain well-positioned to control redistricting for a plurality of U.S. House seats, underscoring Democrats' uphill battle in digging out of GOP gerrymanders put in place after the last census.\n\nIn most states, redistricting is handled through the regular legislative process, with legislatures working to draw maps that are signed into law by governors. In these states, whoever controls the state government controls the redistricting process. Partisan lawmakers often draw districts in a way to disadvantage the opposing party, a process known as gerrymandering.\n\nAccording to state election results compiled by Ballotpedia and Daily Kos\u2019s Stephen Wolf and analyzed by The Washington Post, if redistricting were to occur tomorrow, Republicans would have unified control over the boundaries of 179 House districts, down from 204 before the election. That decrease is due in large part to the loss of governor\u2019s mansions in Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\n\n\n(Illustration by Christopher Ingraham for the Washington Post)\n\nFor simplicity\u2019s sake, this analysis assumes that Republican Brian Kemp is declared the winner of the Georgia governor\u2019s race, keeping that state under unified Republican control. It also assumes the passage of a ballot measure to create an independent redistricting commission in Utah, which is leading by a narrow margin.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, now have complete control over the boundaries of 76 seats, up threefold from just 24 before the election. The lion\u2019s share of that shift is due to New York state, where Democrats took control of the state Senate for the first time since 2010, putting themselves in control of the state\u2019s 27 seats in Congress. Democrats also won unitary control of state governments in Nevada and New Mexico.\n\nThose partisan shifts mean that the number of seats under split control, where both parties have a say in the redistricting process, dropped sharply to 60 following the election.\n\nThe other significant shift was an increase in seats that will be drawn by independent commissions. Voters in Michigan and Colorado approved ballot measures creating such commissions. Voters in Utah appear to be poised to do the same, although the count remains close and the final result has not yet been called.\n\nFormer U.S. attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr., who leads the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said on Twitter that he was \u201cproud of our work that resulted in reform candidate victories, creation of independent commissions and making state legislatures more responsive to the people.\u201d The NDRC had targeted elections in a number of states with an eye toward reducing Republican majorities in state legislatures.\n\nThe 2020 election will be voters' last chance to alter the compositions of their state governments before the redistricting that will happen in 2021.", "UPDATE: The White House suspended Jim Acosta\u2019s press pass hours after the CNN correspondent tangled with the president.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nPresident Trump lashed out at journalists during an afternoon press briefing, calling some of them \u201chostile,\u201d instructing them to sit down and telling a CNN reporter, \u201cYou are a rude, terrible person.\u201d\n\nThe heated exchange occurred Wednesday when CNN reporter Jim Acosta continued to question Trump after the president dismissed him during a news conference about the 2018 midterm elections.

(Capital Weather Gang and Pivotal Weather)\n\nAs a very wet 2018 drifts into its final weeks, the storm train keeps rolling through the eastern United States. The cause is an energetic jet stream that is racing across the Lower 48, ultimately meeting up with moisture in the East to cause widespread storminess.\n\nAlthough the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast are experiencing a mild and relatively sun-filled Wednesday, several chances of more rain are right around the corner and will push a number of locations closer to their wettest years ever.\n\nIn the Mid-Atlantic, a few showers are possible as soon as Wednesday night, but the main storm systems of interest are expected to pass by Friday and early next week. That early-week event even has the potential to be a winterlike nor\u2019easter.\n\nOn Friday, we will see another storm not unlike the ones we saw on Election Day and last Friday. Those events brought rain and severe weather to the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast. Whether an event like this packs a major punch is often heavily dictated by instability. This time, we expect little to none. That should limit the threat of severe thunderstorms.\n\n\n\nRain forecast through Saturday. Most of this is from the Friday storm system. (Capital Weather Gang and Pivotal Weather)\n\nNonetheless, more rain, heavy at times, is likely through the day and perhaps into the night. It could add up to another inch or two in many spots as it traverses from the South and through the Mid-Atlantic, on to New England. It\u2019s a little too soon to get into specifics, but some flash flooding can\u2019t be ruled out if it rains as heavily as some models show it might.\n\nEven in a stormy pattern, the Northeast has had a recent knack for tranquil, dry weekends in between the deluges. That\u2019s the case this time as well, as long as you don\u2019t mind cool weather.\n\n[Coldest air of season coming this weekend and next week, in back-to-back waves]\n\nSkies are clearing from southwest to northeast on Saturday, with blustery conditions. After a cold Saturday night \u2014 Washington may even post its first freeze \u2014 Sunday is sunny across the region, but it remains rather chilly with widespread highs only in the 30s in New England and the 40s across the Mid-Atlantic.\n\n\n\nSunday morning low temperatures per this morning's GFS weather model run. (Capital Weather Gang and Pivotal Weather)\n\nThe cold air mass this weekend helps set the stage for the next storm.\n\nBy Monday, the storm will take shape somewhere between the northern Gulf of Mexico and the southern United States, before heading northeast as it strengthens and matures. There are a range of possible storm tracks still on the table with this system, from just inland near the Interstate 95 corridor, to right up the coast, to farther offshore. The recent pattern may argue for the somewhat inland option, but models have presented a coastal storm scenario as well.\n\nThis storm is likely to bring rain and perhaps some severe weather to the South on Monday before precipitation spreads up the East Coast on Monday night and through Tuesday.\n\nAlthough wet snowflakes aren\u2019t impossible as precipitation begins in lower elevations if the cold air lingers enough Monday night, any meaningful snowfall will probably be confined to the mountains of New England and perhaps the highest elevations of the Mid-Atlantic. The snow-belt areas around the Great Lakes are also likely to get snow this weekend into next week at times, as a result of punches of cold air moving over the relatively warm lake waters.\n\nSome decent snowfall risks downwind of the Great Lakes, as well as in the higher elevations of the Northeast over the next 7 days.

Its wettest year on record is 61.33 inches in 1889.\n\nBaltimore is even closer to notching its wettest year.

(D Dipasupil/FilmMagic)\n\nDuring a news conference following the midterm elections, President Trump denied having ever used racist remarks, including calling the rapper Lil Jon an \u201cUncle Tom.\"\n\nThe question about allegations of racist statements came from Yahoo News\u2019s White House correspondent Hunter Walker. At first, Trump denied knowing who \u201cLittle Jon\u201d was, but then said \u201cokay\u201d after being reminded that the rapper had appeared on \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the exchange:\n\nReporter: Michael Cohen recently said you called black voters \u201cstupid.\u201d Trump: That\u2019s false. Reporter: Omarosa has accused you of using the n-word. Trump: That\u2019s false. Reporter: And the rapper Little Jon has said you called him \u201cUncle Tom.\u201d What\u2019s your response? Trump: I don\u2019t know who Little Jon is. I really don\u2019t. Reporter: He was on \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d Trump: I don\u2019t know. Oh, he was? Okay. Oh, I see. Reporter: Have you ever made racist remarks? Trump: No, no, I would never do that, and I don\u2019t use racist remarks, and you know what, if I did, you people [points to all the reporters], you would have known about it. I\u2019ve been hearing there are [\"Apprentice\"] tapes for years and years, there are tapes. Number one, I never worried about it because I never did. I never used racist remarks. I have never used racist remarks.\n\nIn 2016, the Daily Beast reported that three unnamed staffers on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d said Trump called the rapper \u201cUncle Tom,\u201d apparently not fully realizing how charged of a term it was, and shrugged off advice from producers to stop using it after they explained it to him. Trump\u2019s spokeswoman at the time, Hope Hicks, said \u201cthis is simply untrue.\u201d\n\nSoon after, Lil Jon himself commented, seeming to confirm that Trump called him that but adding that the reality TV host stopped once he was made aware of its meaning.\n\n\u201cWhen this \u2018Uncle Tom\u2019 incident happened on \u2018Celebrity Apprentice' in the boardroom several of my castmates and I addressed Mr. Trump immediately when we heard the comment,\u201d the rapper tweeted. \u201cI can\u2019t say if he knew what he was actually saying or not, but he did stop using that term once we explained it\u2019s offensiveness.\u201d\n\nLil Jon appeared on the \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d in 2011 and again in 2013 during the \u201cAll-Star Celebrity Apprentice.\u201d", "Retiring Rep.

St. Louis, an ocean liner carrying more than 900 German Jews fleeing Europe.\n\nHis speech, just over a week after the massacre at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, showed how anti-Semitism shaped Canada\u2019s response to Jewish refugees fleeing Germany.\n\n\u201cToday, I rise in this House of Commons to issue a long overdue apology to the Jewish refugees Canada turned away,\u201d he said in Ottawa.\n\n\u201cWe used our laws to mask our anti-Semitism, our antipathy, our resentment. We are sorry for the callousness of Canada\u2019s response. And we are sorry for not apologizing sooner.\u201d\n\nSince taking office, Trudeau has delivered several high-profile apologies, so many that he has faced the charge of apologizing too much. Critics wonder what work an apology does, who benefits and whether saying \u201csorry\u201d is ever really enough.\n\nBut coming soon after what may have been the deadliest attack on Jews in American history, at a time when anti-Semitic memes and conspiracy theories abound, Trudeau\u2019s remarks felt urgent.\n\n\u201cHis speech, his words and his apology were very moving and meaningful,\u201d said Avi Benlolo, president of the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies, a Canadian nonprofit organization. \u201cWhat we appreciated from his speech was his focus on contemporary anti-Semitism.\u201d\n\nThe apology connected past to present, showing how the hate that animated Canada\u2019s treatment of Jewish refugees is still ingrained in contemporary politics in Canada, the United States and elsewhere.\n\n\n\nTrudeau said 17 percent of all hate crimes in Canada target Jews.\n\n\u201cHolocaust deniers still exist,\u201d he said. \u201cAnti-Semitism is still far too present. Jewish institutions and neighborhoods are still being vandalized with swastikas.\u201d\n\nHe condemned the attacks in Pittsburgh as a \u201cheinous anti-Semitic act of violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cCanada and Canadians will continue to stand with the Jewish community and call out the hatred that incited such despicable acts,\u201d he said. \u201cThese tragic events ultimately attest to the work we still have to do.\u201d\n\nThe story of the M.S. St. Louis has long been a source of shame for a country that likes to think of itself as a refuge.\n\nIn May 1939, just months before the outbreak of war, an ocean liner left Europe with more than 1,000 passengers, including 907 German Jews. The ship made it to Cuba, but the Jewish refugees were not allowed to disembark. The United States later turned them away.\n\nWith the ship days from Halifax, the Canadian government decided not to help. The ship was sent back to Europe, and 254 of those on board died in the Holocaust.\n\nCanada\u2019s rejection of the St. Louis was not an isolated incident. When it came to Jewish immigration, Canada\u2019s policy at the time was \u201cnone is too many,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\n\u201cOf all the allied countries, Canada would admit the fewest Jews between 1933 and 1945. Far fewer than the United Kingdom and significantly less per capita than the United States,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\nWhen the possibility of an apology for the M.S. St. Louis affair surfaced, some members of the Jewish community expressed concern that a decades-late apology for the turning away of the ship would be too little, too late.\n\nWriting in the Canadian Jewish News, Sally Zerker, an emeritus professor at Toronto\u2019s York University who had family members among those turned away, last year argued that an apology from Trudeau would be \u201cmeaningless.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will not bring back my relatives, or offer me any solace,\u201d she wrote. \u201cInstead, it will whitewash a government that did nothing to help the Jews who were fleeing the Nazis and ignored the type of anti-Semitism that was endemic in Canada until the 1970s.\u201d\n\nOn the eve of the apology, Michael Mostyn, chief executive of B\u2019nai Brith Canada, wrote that the Trudeau government to take action by devoting resources to developing a national action plan to combat anti-Semitism and engage with Jewish institutions, including synagogues, on security.\n\n\u201cThe Jewish community needs committed and concerted action on the part of government to combat the rising tides of anti-Semitism so that, hopefully, there will be no need for apologies in the future,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nCanada\u2019s response to Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s death is a test for Trudeau\n\n\u2018Better than the Olympics\u2019: Canadians line up for marijuana as it becomes legal\n\n\u2018Third World conditions\u2019: Many of Canada\u2019s indigenous people can\u2019t drink the water at home\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "\n\n(Jonathan Bartlett/For The Washington Post)\n\nThis story is one in a series about U.S. human spaceflight.\n\nSpace \u2014 with its bulky spacesuits and microgravity \u2014 does not seem like a good place for sports. Over the years, however, astronauts have found time to play.\n\nMost famously, astronaut Alan Shepard hid a collapsible golf club in his spacesuit when he stepped out on to the moon\u2019s surface as the commander of Apollo 14 in 1971. Shepard dropped two golf balls in the lunar dust and then swung away with his makeshift 6-iron.\n\nMore recently, astronauts have organized relay races as well as tennis and badminton matches on the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not all fun and games in space. There is the very serious business of keeping astronauts fit and healthy in a microgravity environment. Remember, astronauts are staying in space for longer periods of time. In recent years, Scott Kelly and his Russian counterpart, Mikhail Kornienko, spent almost a full year (340 days) on the ISS.\n\nBeing in a weightless environment can cause muscles to grow weak and bones to become more brittle. Weightlessness is also hard on the heart because with little gravity the heart does not have to work as hard to pump blood to all parts of the body.\n\n\n\nAstronaut Chris Cassidy exercises on the advanced Resistive Exercise Device (aRED) on the International Space Station in 2013. Without the help of gravity, it\u2019s a challenge to come up with ways for astronauts to stay fit. (NASA via AP)\n\nSome have compared being in space for long periods to being in bed for months at a time. The body grows weak without moving around and without regular exercise.\n\nSo how do astronauts exercise and stay in shape in space? It\u2019s a tricky question because almost all exercises \u2014 lifting weights, running, jumping \u2014 make the body stronger because the body is fighting against gravity.\n\nI asked Sunita \u201cSuni\u201d (pronounced Sunny) Williams for some answers. She has been an astronaut for 20 years and has spent more than 300 days in space. Williams has also logged more than 50 hours on spacewalks. She is training for a six-month mission on the ISS scheduled to begin next year.\n\nWilliams said it helps to be in good shape before you blast off. An astronaut needs to be at a certain level of fitness so she can do the work in space. Spacewalks, according to Williams, are especially exhausting. Several hours working outside the ISS can feel \u201clike a whole day of skiing.\u201d\n\nWilliams, who is 53, started getting in shape as a girl growing up in Needham, Massachusetts. She was a competitive swimmer who also hiked, ran cross-country and played soccer. Williams still runs and even brought her passion for running into space.\n\nThe astronauts on the ISS (there are usually six) have to work out two hours every day. They spend about an hour exercising their legs and heart by pedaling a stationary bike and running on a treadmill.\n\nThe computerized treadmill is not the kind you would see at a local gym. The astronauts have to wear a special harness and belts to keep them from floating off the machine.\n\nWilliams used the treadmill to run in the Boston Marathon in 2007. She had qualified for the famous 26.2-mile event but was going to be in space during the actual running of the race. Her sister contacted race organizers and asked if Williams could run anyway . . . on the ISS treadmill.\n\nThe race organizers said okay. So Williams hopped on the treadmill at the beginning of the marathon and ran the entire distance. She even had an official race number.\n\nThe astronauts also \u201clift weights\u201d to keep their upper body in shape. Of course, they don\u2019t actually lift weights because everything is weightless in space. Instead, they use a Resistance Exercise Device that has the astronaut pulling, pumping and squatting against the force of a vacuum.\n\nWilliams\u2019s advice to kids who think all this microgravity stuff sounds like fun?\n\nFirst, \u201cdon\u2019t take your health for granted\u201d and \u201cstay in shape.\u201d Astronauts will have to be in good physical condition to endure long space travel and to work on Mars. \u201cWe are not sending people to Mars to be couch potatoes,\u201d she said.\n\nWilliams encourages kids to get used to thinking \u201cout of the box.\u201d Everything about this weightless world requires people to think in new and creative ways.\n\nSuch as when the NASA engineers and astronauts continue to wonder: How do you stay fit in space?\n\nRead more Score columns:\n\nNASA plans to return to the moon as a pit stop on the way to Mars\n\nWould you travel in space?

Know that I am 100% committed to this conference and I would be honored to have your support.\u201d\n\nHis announcement came a day after Republicans lost their majority in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and a staunch ally of President Trump, said that he would also seek the post. An election is scheduled for next week.\n\nBoth men are running to replace retiring House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) as the top Republican in the chamber.\n\nIn his letter, McCarthy acknowledged it was \u201ca difficult day\u201d following Tuesday\u2019s election results, which make it likely that Rep.

Trump was asked whether he believed Saudi Arabia is guilty of having Khashoggi killed.\n\nTrump called Khashoggi\u2019s death a \u201cvery sad thing, very terrible thing\u201d and said he was consulting with Congress on how to respond.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have a much stronger opinion on that subject over the next week,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m forming a very strong opinion.\u201d\n\nKhashoggi, a Saudi who was a contributing columnist for The Washington Post, was killed in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.\n\nThe government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has tried to prod Saudi leaders to acknowledge what he says is their role in the death. The Saudi government refused to comment for weeks but, in the face of international outrage, finally conceded that Khashoggi was killed in their consulate, even as they blamed it on rogue Saudi agents.", "The GOP once tried to make the case that politicians such as Utah\u2019s Rep. Mia Love, the first black Republican woman elected to Congress, and Rep. Will Hurd (R-Tex), the first black Republican to win a U.S. congressional seat in Texas, were the future of the Republican Party. But Tuesday\u2019s election suggested that Florida Gov.-elect Ron DeSantis and Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (Calif.) are where the party is headed.\n\nHunter, DeSantis, and several other Republican candidates followed their party leader\u2019s playbook when it came to embracing divisive rhetoric, including what his critics call his racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia. And that may have worked.\n\nIn some of the races where the GOP candidate stoked the most controversial aspects of Trumpism most strongly, voters got behind the Republican.\n\nDeSantis made headlines the day after his primary win when he warned that Andrew Gillum, who many hoped would be Florida\u2019s first black governor, would \u201cmonkey this up\u201d if elected to the top seat in the state. After giving the college-educated Tallahassee mayor a backhanded compliment by calling him articulate, DeSantis attracted the scorn of liberals and the praise of white supremacists.\n\nThe most striking example of that was an Idaho-based white supremacist group\u2019s racist robo-calls targeting Gillum, featuring a man impersonating the candidate speaking in a minstrel dialect while chimpanzee noises played in the background. DeSantis called that robo-call \u201cdisgusting.\"\n\nOther statements from DeSantis about Rep.-elect Alexandria Occasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) were perceived as problematic, as was his acceptance of a donation from a donor who used the n-word in a tweet criticizing former president Barack Obama.\n\nMost polls had Gillum winning the race, some by as much as seven points. But ultimately, DeSantis\u2019s campaign pledge to govern as a localized version of Trump won the day. He won more than 49 percent of the vote.\n\nComments near the end of the campaign from Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), who has a long history of embracing white nationalism, were deemed so racist that members of his own party spoke out against them. He was photographed with a Confederate flag on his desk and has questioned the contributions to modern civilization of people who are not white.\n\nHe went so far as to say that neo-Nazi politics embraced in Europe would align with the Republican Party if advocated in the United States.\n\nRep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, called King\u2019s comments \u201ccompletely inappropriate.\u201d\n\nCongressman Steve King\u2019s recent comments, actions, and retweets are completely inappropriate.

But he won his race with more than 50 percent of the vote.\n\nRep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-Calif.), who was indicted on federal charges of wire fraud, also took a page out of the early Trump\u2019s playbook. After Hunter aired ads accusing Ammar Campa-Najjar, his half-Arab, Christian opponent, of having the support of the Muslim Brotherhood \u201cto infiltrate Congress,\u201d the Atlantic\u2019s McCay Coppins ran a piece calling Hunter\u2019s \u201cthe most anti-Muslim campaign in the country.\u201d A culture war in one school district might have helped secure him a victory.

They found a voice in Trump, who spent the final days of the midterm elections playing into the cultural anxieties of his base when it comes to immigration, reminding his supporters still uncomfortable with Obama\u2019s \u201cotherness\u201d about the former president\u2019s middle name, Hussein, and repeatedly dismissing Stacey Abrams, who hoped to become America\u2019s first black woman governor, as unqualified.\n\nWhen it comes to issues of diversity \u2014 particularly race, immigration and religion \u2014 some GOP candidates have figured that following Trump\u2019s lead is the best path to victory.", "", "\n\nWisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker, left, lost to Democrat Tony Evers. (Wisconsin State Journal via AP)\n\nDespite winning control of the House, many Democrats went to bed Tuesday deflated that they fell short in marquee races.\n\nAfter losing badly in Rust Belt states like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan in 2016, the party turned a lot of its attention to the Sun Belt, where changing demographics in places like Georgia, Florida and Texas suggested that, with the right candidate in the right moment, there could be an opening for Democrats.\n\nAnd yet, despite all the star power and national attention lavished on them, Beto O\u2019Rourke did not oust Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas, Andrew Gillum did not win the governorship in Florida, and Stacey Abrams, though she has not yet conceded, is down by two points in the Georgia gubernatorial race.\n\nBut while those candidates took up most of the midterms' oxygen, Democrats were mounting a comeback in the Rust Belt.\n\n[Winners and Losers from the 2018 midterms]\n\nOf the five competitive statewide races in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan, Democrats won four of them. They held their Senate and governor seats in Pennsylvania and beat the Republican candidate for governor in Michigan, as well as the incumbent in Wisconsin, onetime presidential nominee and GOP rising star Gov. Scott Walker.\n\nIf that is predictive of their chances in those states in 2020, Democrats should be thrilled.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s narrow losses in Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 states the Clinton campaign took for granted and presumed she\u2019d win \u2014 cost her the election. She lost each by less than one percentage point, in Michigan by just 10,000 votes. Postmortems on 2016 blamed the Clinton camp for failing to make their case to white working-class voters in those states and suggested those places were slipping away from Democrats.\n\nFast forward two years later and Democrats finished strong in both states.\n\nFirst let\u2019s look at Michigan. Gretchen Whitmer ran a race that was unapologetically pro-women. But she also focused on issues that everyone in the state cares about, such as clean water and infrastructure; her slogan was to \u201cfix the damn roads.\u201d That appealed to a wide swath of voters, showing Democrats they don\u2019t need to match President Trump\u2019s vitriol to win over voters in the Midwest. She won handily, securing 2.2 million votes to her opponent\u2019s 1.8 million.\n\nThen there\u2019s Wisconsin, easily the biggest victory of the night for Democrats in the region. Democrat Tony Evers, a name few people outside of Wisconsin knew until Tuesday night, beat Walker, a national name brand. Evers, a gray-haired, bespectacled state schools superintendent, ran an almost entirely state-focused race that took on Walker\u2019s record, not Trump. He offered a measured approach that suggests celebrity status isn\u2019t necessary to succeed in the Midwest.\n\nSo what does this mean for Democrats' chances in 2020? Donald Trump was not on the ballot this year \u2014 he didn\u2019t campaign for Republican candidates in Michigan and only showed up once in Wisconsin. But after Tuesday\u2019s losses, expect Trump to campaign relentlessly for himself in these two states.\n\nDemocrats can try again to make inroads in the Sun Belt, and their narrow losses there suggest there\u2019s real potential for movement in their direction, but if they gloss over the Rust Belt again, they\u2019ll do so at their own peril.", "\n\nCamila Savioll Mejia, 4, cries and refuses to walk any farther in San Pedro Tapanatepec, Mexico, on Oct. 29. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nSAN PEDRO TAPANATEPEC, Mexico \u2014 The migrant caravan came alive one morning last week with a rustle of plastic tarps being taken down and packed. A crowd gathered well before dawn.\n\nNear the back of that crowd stood Keila Savioll Mejia. Two weeks earlier, the shy 21-year-old had left home in Honduras to join the caravan with her 2-year-old and 4-year-old daughters. She listened as organizers announced that two trucks were available to take women and children from Tapanatepec to the next stop, 33 miles away.\n\nMejia thought about rushing forward to claim the last spot. Both of her daughters were sick and Camila, the oldest, was tired of walking. But she said she worried they would be crushed or suffocated in the throng. So she let others climb into the back of the truck, which soon overflowed with about three dozen people.\n\n\u201cThere are no more trucks,\u201d an organizer said over a loudspeaker. \u201cLet's go.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, Mejia and her daughters set off on foot.\n\nPresident Trump has portrayed the migrant caravan as a monolithic threat, a mass of \u201cterrorists\u201d intent on \u201cinvading\u201d the United States. In reality, the caravan is a collection of individuals and families, each with their own story. And few were worse off than Mejia.\n\nAs she carried 2-year-old Samantha through the streets of Tapanatepec, she saw several families with sturdy strollers they had bought for 900 pesos \u2014 around $45 \u2014 at the Mexico-Guatemala border. Others were flimsy, held together with tape or twine. One father pushed his 5-year-old son in a donated wheelchair.\n\nMejia had nothing, not even a baby carrier.\n\n\n\nKeila Savioll Mejia, 21, holds her daughter Samantha, 2, left, as Johana Hernandez, 16, center, watches 4-year-old Camila. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nBy the time the caravan reached the edge of town, Mejia\u2019s thin arms already ached from carrying her toddler. So mother and daughters rested under a tree.\n\nMejia wore pink plastic slippers so thin they were like walking in bare feet. The girls wore sandals that were hardly any better. Besides a few donated diapers friends carried for them, all their belongings fit into a tiny \u201cMafalda\u201d bag on Mejia\u2019s back.\n\nSoon, they were back on their feet, Samantha on Mejia\u2019s shoulders and Camila holding hands with Bessi Zelaya, a friend from Pe\u00f1a Blanca.\n\nAs they walked through the pre-dawn darkness, the silence was broken every few minutes by the buzz of approaching motorcycle taxis. The tiny three-wheel vehicles would pull up, and half a dozen migrants would pile in, paying a few Mexican pesos to get a little closer to the next stop.\n\nBut Mejia didn\u2019t have a few pesos.\n\nIn Pe\u00f1a Blanca she had made 100 lempiras \u2014 about $4 \u2014 a day selling tortillas. The girls' father had left them long ago, so they lived with Mejia\u2019s mother and siblings in a small cinder block house.\n\nWhen she heard of the caravan forming in San Pedro Sula just 50 miles away, Mejia borrowed 500 lempiras from a friend, packed her daughter\u2019s backpack and boarded a bus to the capital. By the time they caught up to the caravan a few days later, Mejia had spent half her money on bus fare. She quickly used the rest to buy food for the girls.\n\n\u201cWe've had to walk ever since,\u201d she said.\n\nAs young men strode past and another overloaded mototaxi sped away, an organizer in a yellow traffic vest issued a warning to those falling behind.\n\n\u201cHurry up,\u201d he said, \u201cor immigration will grab you.\u201d\n\nThe fear was real. The sheer size of the caravan made it difficult for Mexican authorities to stop. But small groups that had split off had reportedly been detained and deported. The same could happen to stragglers.\n\nCamila, her tiny legs already exhausted, collapsed to the ground. The girl closed her eyes.\n\n\n\nAn exhausted Camila collapses to the ground. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cCamila!\u201d Mejia said sharply.\n\n\u201cArriba,\u201d said Zelaya, lifting her onto the shoulders of Fernando Reyes Enamorado, a neighbor from Pe\u00f1a Blanca. Camila drooped over the 19-year-old\u2019s head.\n\nThey continued walking, but when they stopped at a house where the owners had brought out a jug of water for the migrants, Camila refused to get up. Mejia splashed the girl in the face with water, but she just sat on the ground, kicking off her sandals and beginning to cry.\n\n\u201cLev\u00e1ntate,\u201d Mejia told her. \u201cGet up.\u201d\n\nA family with a stroller went past. Then another, and another. Flashing lights in the distance behind them were a reminder that if they fell far enough behind, their journey could be over in an instant.\n\nStrangers stopped to offer to carry Camila, but the girl refused to let anyone touch her.\n\n\n\nKeila Savioll Mejia carries her two daughters during the caravan. If they fell too far behind, they risked being detained and deported. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nMinutes passed as Samantha cried and Camila screamed and the caravan kept going without them. Friends disappeared into the distance. Dawn began to break. Soon the sun would rise, and the temperature would climb to nearly 100 degrees.\n\nSo Mejia did the only thing she could: She lifted both girls \u2014 one over each shoulder \u2014 and started walking.\n\nWithin a few minutes, she had caught up with the others where the road met a highway. Migrants slept in the ditch as they waited for trucks on which to catch a ride.\n\nMejia set the girls down and handed them candy to keep them awake.\n\nBut as vehicles approached, it was the young men who always reacted first. They climbed atop oil tankers and leaped aboard moving container trucks.\n\nSo Mejia started walking again, Samantha in her arms and Camila flailing unhappily at her side.\n\nBut then their luck suddenly changed. As she passed a red car belonging to a Televisa news crew, the cameraman recognized her.\n\nPaco Santana, a TV anchorman, had interviewed Mejia a few days earlier and had given her a lift. Now he offered to do so again.\n\n\n\nKeila Savioll Mejia and her daughters receive a much needed lift when a local television reporter offers them a ride.

Then she looked at her daughters.\n\n\u201cDo you want to go in the car, like the other day?\u201d Santana asked Camila and Samantha.\n\nWith shouts of excitement, her daughters made the decision for her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have cookies this time,\u201d Santana said, opening the door of his car, where the pregnant woman and her partner were already waiting for a ride. \u201cShould we go get some?\u201d\n\nAnd then it was on to the next town, the single mother\u2019s odyssey over \u2014 at least for another day.\n\n\n\nSamantha Savioll Mejia, 2, peaks out the window of a car belonging to the Televisa news crew while sitting on her mother's lap.

Trump likes to joust, and he likes to pit his base against the media. But Trump\u2019s skin seemed especially thin Wednesday. And for a guy who was supposed to be happy with a \u201ccomplete victory\u201d Tuesday, he was projecting quite the opposite. He wasn\u2019t exactly selling the idea that he was pleased with what had just happened. If he was, why would he be so especially punchy?\n\nAnd you could forgive him. Trump is a proud person, and even he has intermittently admitted that the 2018 election was a referendum on him. Losing more than 30 House seats and the House has to feel like a reflection of himself, even if he won\u2019t admit it. Indeed, Trump\u2019s almost incessant re-litigating of why he deserves credit for Tuesday\u2019s results suggests he\u2019s not feeling terribly confident about it.\n\nHe\u2019s also now got to put up with Democrats being able to subpoena his administration and possibly even get his tax returns.

Scott Walker tried to warn supporters that his campaign was on shaky ground, to get out and knock on doors and vote, because the Far Left was riding a Blue Wave, and it was aimed right at him.\n\nVoters in Wisconsin sunk his bid for a rare third term by a slim margin in favor of his Democratic opponent, the state\u2019s schools superintendent, Tony Evers, 67, leaving the future of a man once considered one of the brightest stars of the conservative GOP firmament uncertain.\n\nAfter a wild night of vote changes, Evers finally declared victory about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, but Walker did not concede until the afternoon \u2014 tweeting that his camp had been waiting on some information on damaged outstanding ballots they eventually concluded would be insignificant in the final count.\n\n[Evers denies Walker a third term as Wisconsin governor]\n\nWalker, 51, first elected in 2010, has been one of the most polarizing governors in the state\u2019s history, beginning with his first months in office when he rode an early clash with organized labor to fame and survived a heated recall campaign the following year. He\u2019s a hero to many conservatives, but voter after voter, especially teachers, will still say how angry and bitter they are about that union-busting episode.\n\nTuesday, younger, energetic Democrats, particularly in the \u201cblue\u201d urban areas around Milwaukee and the University of Wisconsin in Madison, turned out in large numbers to finally tip the balance against his traditional support in the red Milwaukee suburbs and Green Bay, according to Arnold Shober, an associate professor of government at Lawrence University. There were an estimated 6,000 more voters around Madison than in the previous governor\u2019s race, he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, a jubilant Evers said he was confident that his margin of victory \u2014 a final vote percentage of 50 to 48 percent and a difference of 29,000 votes \u2014 would stand.\n\n\u201cThe amount of enthusiasm this campaign has generated has been really rewarding,\u201d Evers said in an interview. \u201cIt gives me great hope.\u201d\n\n[Scott Walker\u2019s real record on higher education in Wisconsin]\n\nEvers is a former science teacher with a grandfatherly vibe, who traveled around the state in a rattle-y yellow school bus in the days before the election.

In the end, Walker\u2019s \u201cprogrammatic, laserlike focus on fiscal conservatism\u201d did not prevail, he noted.\n\nOn the stump, Walker had framed his argument for reelection around the state\u2019s burgeoning economy, touting Wisconsin\u2019s low unemployment rate \u2014 hovering around 3 percent \u2014 and strong wage growth. \u201cIf we get that message out,\u201d he told reporters after a campaign event in Appleton on Sunday, \u201cwe win.\u201d\n\nDuring the waning days of the campaign, Walker was accused of handing out a grab-bag of election year treats, including a $100-per-child rebate and a sales tax holiday.\n\nThe two sides traded barbs over whether Walker supported the provision in the Affordable Care Act that prevents health insurers from denying coverage to patients with preexisting conditions. Walker insisted he did, even as the state joined a federal lawsuit seeking to block it.\n\n[Inside the collapse of Scott Walker\u2019s presidential bid]\n\nLooming over the race was the outsized figure of the commander in chief, President Trump, who eked out a slim margin of victory of about 22,700 votes in Wisconsin in 2016, the first time the state went for a Republican candidate since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Although Trump came to campaign for him last month, Walker rarely mentioned him.\n\nAnalysts say that voters long ago made up their mind about Walker, with voters evenly divided about him throughout the recall effort and failed presidential bid through the present day, according to Barry C. Burden, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.\n\n\u201cPeople just hate him horribly, or other people have signs in their yard,\u201d said Marilyn Kinsman-Kharbush, 65, a cafe owner in central Reedsburg.\n\nWalker, the son of a minister, came from modest circumstances and cultivated a regular guy image, with jokes about his $1 sweater from discount retailer Kohl's.\n\n[Walker\u2019s anti-union law has labor reeling in Wisconsin]\n\nProgressives around the state, including teachers, still speak bitterly of the episode that propelled him to the national stage \u2014 2011 legislation that eliminated most collective bargaining for public employees, known as Act 10, that sparked days of protest at the Capitol and eventually a failed recall effort backed by big labor.\n\n\u201cHe made us the enemy. That was very hurtful,\u201d said Jane Roberts, 76, a retired public school teacher.\n\nOther saw him as a hero: \u201cYou\u2019re just like Abraham Lincoln to me!\u201d supporter Mary Ley, 53, gushed to Walker at one campaign stop.\n\nWalker\u2019s presidential hopes were dashed early; he was the first to leave the race in 2015, broke and thrown off-message by the Trump juggernaut. Yet his commitment to tax cuts and fiscal conservatism means he will likely remain a conservative icon with presidential aspirations \u2014 he ably outfundraised his opponent $31 million to $9 million, according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign.

(Photo by Andrew Cullen/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe Pentagon has directed U.S. military commanders to stop calling the deployment of active-duty troops to the southern border \u201cOperation Faithful Patriot,\u201d a name derided by critics as overtly political while President Trump played up the mission in stumping for Republican candidates.\n\nThe decision was acknowledged Wednesday after the midterm elections, and it was not immediately clear what name the military operation may ultimately take instead.\n\n\u201cWe are no longer calling it Operation Faithful Patriot,\u201d said a Pentagon spokesman, Army Lt. Col. Jamie Davis. \u201cWe are referring to it as border support. I have nothing further at this time.\u201d\n\nA second Pentagon spokesman, Chris Sherwood, said that simply referring to the military operation as \u201cborder support\u201d is a \u201cmore accurate description\u201d because the Department of Homeland Security is overseeing it. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which said the directive was issued by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis\u2019s office on Election Day. He has sought to shield the military from politics, with mixed results.\n\nThe operation has come under fire from some retired generals, who say it unnecessarily thrusts the military into politics. Trump sought to characterize migrants traveling north through Mexico from Central America in a \u201ccaravan\u201d as an \u201cinvasion\u201d of the United States. In reality, the group is believed to consist almost entirely of families who could legally apply for asylum at ports of entry at the border.\n\nThe operation, announced Oct. 29, is in support of the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection. The Pentagon has sought to stress that it has only a support role, while the president has suggested that the military will face the migrants at the border.\n\nArmy Col. Rob Manning, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters Monday that the administration specifically asked for active-duty service members to deploy for the operation. They are limited in what they can do by the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits federal military from involvement in most domestic law enforcement missions in the United States. About 5,200 active-duty troops were expected to be involved in Faithful Patriot by Monday.\n\nThe military has deployed the U.S. military to the border before, but not in such large numbers of active-duty troops in a century. More typically, National Guard units, which operate under state authority, are called upon to provide support.\n\nThe U.S. military has released dozens of photos and videos in recent days of service members on the border, including some Tuesday of Air Force Gen. Terrence O\u2019Shaughnessy, chief of U.S. Northern Command, visiting service members deployed to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base as part of the operation. To date, the Pentagon has not allowed any independent media to cover the operations and provide a fuller account of what is occurring.", "\n\nAmerican (GFS) model shows big dips in the jet stream arriving Saturday and late Tuesday over the eastern United States, allowing pools of cold air to dive south.

That\u2019s partly because a number of dynamic young Democrats who had raised perhaps unreasonable hopes for victory fell short, but it\u2019s also because Republicans are naturally triumphal even when they lose and Democrats tend to get depressed even when they win.\n\nSo in order to put the election in perspective, I\u2019d like to widen our gaze beyond a few Senate and House races and look at some of the other results, particularly at the state level. When you do that, you see that Democrats have an awful lot to be happy about even beyond taking the House. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nDemocrats won in key governor\u2019s races. While much of the attention was focused on the campaigns of Andrew Gillum in Florida and Stacey Abrams in Georgia, both of which fell just short (though Abrams still hopes to force her opponent into a runoff), Democrats won a bunch of key governor\u2019s races around the country. They flipped seven seats: Nevada, New Mexico, Kansas, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois and Maine. Those victories included defeats for reviled Republicans Scott Walker and Kris Kobach, as well as electing the first openly gay governor (Jared Polis of Colorado) and the second Latina governor (Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico) in the nation\u2019s history. Republicans did not win any governorships held by a Democrat.\n\nDemocrats won big in state legislatures. You\u2019ve probably heard that over the eight years Barack Obama was president, Democrats lost a net of almost a thousand seats in state legislatures. Which is bad, but last night Democrats gained about 300 seats, so they\u2019re well on their way to reversing those losses.\n\nBut the raw numbers are less important than where they picked up seats. Democrats gained \u201ctrifectas\u201d \u2014 controlling the governorship and both houses of the legislature \u2014 in six states: Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Nevada, New Mexico and New York. In addition, they took away Republican trifectas in four more states, three by winning the governorship (Kansas, Michigan and Wisconsin) and one by taking both chambers of the legislature (New Hampshire). They also flipped the Maine Senate and Minnesota House, and won supermajorities in the Oregon House and Senate. The only chamber that flipped to Republican was the Alaska House.\n\nSpeaking of supermajorities, Democrats also won enough seats in North Carolina to break the GOP supermajorities in both houses there, meaning Republicans can no longer override Democratic governor Roy Cooper\u2019s vetoes. They also broke Republican supermajorities in the Pennsylvania Senate and Michigan Senate.\n\nDemocratic women won everywhere. As of now, 95 women have won or are projected to win seats in the House, 82 of whom are Democrats. That includes the first two Muslim American women and the first two Native American women; a record number of women of color will be serving in the next Congress. We also saw six Democratic women win governor\u2019s races, and we should take particular note of Michigan, where Democratic women swept races for governor, senator, attorney general and secretary of state.\n\nAmericans\u2019 health care won big. Voters in the conservative states of Idaho, Nebraska and Utah passed ballot initiatives to accept the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of Medicaid, which will bring coverage to hundreds of thousands of their citizens. In addition, Maine voters elected Democrat Janet Mills as governor, which should mean that the expansion legislators approved will finally be enacted now that America\u2019s Worst Governor\u2122 Paul LePage will finally be gone. It\u2019s also possible that some of the other new Democratic governors could persuade legislatures in remaining holdout states to finally take the money the federal government is offering them to expand coverage.\n\nVoting rights and democratic reforms were expanded. Voters in Michigan passed initiatives that will turn over redistricting to a nonpartisan commission and allow for automatic voter registration, same-day registration, no-excuse absentee voting, and straight-ticket voting. Voters in Colorado and probably Utah (votes are still being tallied) approved nonpartisan redistricting commissions, Nevadans approved automatic voter registration, and Maryland voters approved same-day registration.\n\nThere were a couple of setbacks for voting rights, as Arkansas and North Carolina passed voter ID measures. But in the most important victory, Florida voters chose to cast off a legacy of Jim Crow and allow felons who have served their time to vote, which will mean that 1.6 million Floridians will get their voting rights restored.\n\nOther progressive ballot measures won. A strong gun safety measure passed in Washington state. Michigan voters legalized recreational marijuana, and medical marijuana was approved in Missouri, Oklahoma and Utah. Voters in Missouri and Arkansas passed increases in the minimum wage.\n\nThis really was a blue wave. There\u2019s no question that Republicans won some key victories, but that shouldn\u2019t distract us from just how big a blue wave this was \u2014 even if gerrymandering and geography helped contain its effects. Consider that in 2010, Republicans won the popular House vote by 7 percentage points and picked up 63 seats. Everyone described it as a crushing defeat for the Democrats (even though they held on to the Senate) and evidence of an unstoppable anti-Obama movement in the form of the tea party. This year, the Democrats are projected to have won the popular vote by the same amount, though when all the counting is done, they\u2019ll net only up to around 35 seats.\n\nSo in terms of the message voters sent, 2018 was unquestionably on par with other midterm waves like 1994, 2006 and 2010. You can see the results wherever you look.\n\nRead more:\n\nGreg Sargent: Three of Trump\u2019s biggest fables died last night\n\nJennifer Rubin: Here\u2019s what did and didn\u2019t work for Democrats\n\nCarter Eskew: Buck up, Democrats\n\nAsli Aydintasbas: Why the Democratic victory in the House is a big deal for the rest of the world\n\nJeff Flake: Republicans must move beyond the cult of Trump\u2019s personality\n\nDavid Moscrop: As Canadians sort through midterm results, we should rethink our ties to Washington", "", "\n\nScenes from the final night of Election 2018 in El Paso and Boston.

On Tuesday, out here in their respective corner pockets of the American pool table, the results seemed preordained yet somehow beside the point. In the desert chill of El Paso, there would be destiny in defeat. In rain-soaked Boston, there would be prologue in victory. Tuesday may not have been a massive wave, but for Democrats, it felt like a preview.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m as hopeful as I\u2019ve ever been in my life,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said, after coming within 2.6 points of slaying Sen.

Everyone had been running hot. The red hats showed up at MAGA rallies. The Women\u2019s March, the travel ban, Charlottesville, family separations at the border, the Kavanaugh hearings \u2014 all in the past 22 months, each a flame underneath a simmering resistance. And then people voted, in record numbers for a midterm election.\n\nFor Democrats, it felt like a countrywide casting call for a 2020 hero, for someone (anyone) who might have the guts and skills to take on an incumbent armed with a good economy. It was the last day of the 2018 election, the 1,240th day of the 2016 campaign America just can\u2019t seem to shake and day zero for 2020.\n\nIn Ohio, Sen.

El Paso is not quite Texas, and two years ago El Paso was not quite anything, in national politics.\n\nIn February 2017, just before he announced his long-shot bid for the Senate, Beto O\u2019Rourke was a third-term minority-party congressman sitting on a West Texas hilltop after an early morning hike, saying this about his hometown: \u201cIt\u2019s had a chip on its shoulder. For a long time it was a place that people passed over.\u201d\n\nNot anymore. This week there were no rental cars left at the El Paso airport. Hotels were booked solid.

Over in northeast El Paso, Ann Singer was smoking a Marlboro at her dining table and plotting the final hours of her pop-up operation to get out the vote. Women were coming through to phone bank and going out to knock doors. Regardless of the outcome, Singer, 72, thought the rest of the country has something to learn from El Paso, which has a deep financial and emotional relationship with Ciudad Juarez, the Mexican city just across the Rio Grande.\n\n\n\nSupporters scream and weep as O\u2019Rourke, following his defeat to incumbent Cruz, speaks in El Paso. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\n\"Do you think we're afraid of a caravan?\" Singer said. \"If immigrants get here, they work hard, they stay at periscope depth. They clean our homes, they take care of our old people, they build our roads. These are honorable people.\"\n\nWarren\u2019s offices in Lynn, Mass., were run by women and staffed by women \u2014 older women with brooches, younger women with pens behind their ears. Bambi Snodgrass, 58, had been knocking on doors since May. She hit 167 homes over the weekend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to Washington for Kavanaugh. I\u2019ve been arrested five times.

Every day I am outraged, and I used that outrage to fuel change.\u201d\n\nHers wasn\u2019t a close race, so much of Warren\u2019s time had been spent calling candidates across the country to offer support and advice. Her staff was spread out, too, working in key presidential primary states such as South Carolina and Nevada. Warren\u2019s Republican opponent, Geoff Diehl, is a representative in the Massachusetts statehouse, and her independent challenger, Shiva Ayyadurai, had yard signs that said, \u201cIt will take a real Indian to defeat a Fake Indian.\u201d\n\nIn El Paso, the Beto signs \u2014 four stark white letters on black \u2014 were everywhere. Yards. Cars. Stickers on people\u2019s cheeks. There were at least two small signs for Ted Cruz, both near the entrance to the headquarters of the El Paso County Republican Party, on the back side of a business park. But there was quiet confidence in Cruz, because Texas is Texas.

There were no TVs in the stadium, so attendees huddled over their phones, thumbing refresh, as cell service got more sluggish.\n\nThe news spread like a fog just after 8 p.m.: Cruz appeared to have beaten O\u2019Rourke, but not by much. People stayed anyway. They smiled and danced anyway. The result was not the end.\n\nAt 11:11 p.m. Eastern time, Warren bounded onto the stage in Boston and held her arms out wide, letting the cheers wash over her.\n\n\u201cThank you!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2018\n\nBy this standard, a segment of commentary on Fox Business Network surely sidesteps this slanderous basket. Commentator Ben Stein examined the Senate victories for Republican candidates \u2014 several of whom received campaign-rally support from the president. \u201cThere\u2019s only been five times in the last 105 years that an incumbent President has won seats in the Senate in the off-year election,\u201d said Stein. \u201cMr. Trump has magic about him. This guy has magic coming out his ears. He is an astonishing vote-getter, an astonishing campaigner. Republicans are unbelievably lucky to have him, and I\u2019m just awed at how well they\u2019ve done. \u2026 It\u2019s all the Trump magic. Trump is a magic man.\u201d\n\nSo Trump tweeted out his comments. Lest there be any confusion, Stein\u2019s praise stands as the president\u2019s standard \u2014 that\u2019s \u201cproper credit.\u201d\n\nOthers have nodded to the impact of Trump\u2019s frenetic preelection rallying for Republican Senate candidates, though it\u2019s unclear whether such commentary would qualify as \u201cproper credit\u201d in the eyes of the country\u2019s most powerful narcissist. \u201cI think you can also look at the results tonight if you\u2019re President Trump and you can say, \u201cMy political instincts are generally still pretty good,\u2019 \u201d said CNN political analyst Abby Phillip late Tuesday night. \u201c\u2018I still know how to get my people out.

The city will charge businesses on a progressive payment scale, with larger companies paying more for each employee as their head counts rise. Three nearby cities have already levied a head tax on local businesses, according to the report, but critics say Measure P unfairly singles out Google, which will absorb 60 percent of the tax.\n\nThe passage of the initiative comes as voters in San Francisco approved Proposition C, a tax on the city\u2019s largest businesses to combat homelessness. Together, the ballot measures highlight the tension between the massive wealth generated by the area\u2019s tech industry and the push by local residents for greater civic contributions from corporations. Proponents of the initiatives say the taxes will help ease some of the problems created or exacerbated by the tech industry\u2019s success, notably the rising cost of living and transportation woes.\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s Proposition C will levy a tax on companies of about .5 percent of gross receipts but will only apply to businesses with revenue greater than $50 million. The measure is expected to generate as much as $300 million per year or about double the amount the city currently spends on homeless services, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The tax will supply funds for housing and mental health services.\n\nThe measure was backed by tech billionaire Marc Benioff, founder of Salesforce, who celebrated its passage on Twitter, saying, \u201cProp C\u2019s victory means the homeless will have a home & the help they truly need! Let the city come together in Love for those who need it most!\u201d But opponents of the initiative had their own tech mogul allies, who have criticized the business impacts of the tax and its supposed lack of accountability. Twitter and Square chief executive Jack Dorsey, Stripe chief executive Patrick Collison, and Zynga chairman and co-founder Mark Pincus have voiced opposition to the measure.\n\nThe Mountain View head tax will phase in over two years beginning in 2020.

As of 11 a.m., unofficial returns showed Abrams trailing Kemp by just over 67,000 votes.\n\n\u201cWe are committed and remain committed to ensuring that every vote is counted,\u201d Groh-Wargo said, adding that the campaign\u2019s legal team was reviewing Georgia elections laws and continuing to collect information about problems in some counties with long lines and broken machines at the polls on Tuesday and outstanding mail-in ballots that are still trickling in.\n\nIn Fulton County, where some voters stood in lines for up to three hours, in some cases because of an inadequate number of voting machines, WSB Channel 2 reported that 700 machines sat in a warehouse because they were sequestered as part of a pending lawsuit.\n\nIn Dougherty County, which was hit hard when Hurricane Michael roared through southwest Georgia, thousands of mail-in ballots were delayed because county offices were shut down for three days and mail is reportedly being routed through Tallahassee. The Georgia Democratic Party had asked Gov. Nathan Deal (R) to extend the deadline for Dougherty County to received mail-in ballots, but got no response.\n\nNormally, the deadline for counties to certify their results is the Monday after the election, but they will now have until Tuesday because of the Veterans Day federal holiday.\n\nCandice Broce, spokeswoman for the secretary of state\u2019s office, said via email Wednesday: \u201cThe election results are not official until each county certifies its own results, sends those totals to the Secretary of State\u2019s office, and the Secretary of State\u2019s office certifies that the combined vote totals are accurate. Counties must certify their election results by 5 PM on or before Tuesday, November 13. The Secretary of State\u2019s office must certify the election results on or before Monday, November 20.\u201d\n\nUnder Georgia law, recounts can be initiated if the margin between the candidates is less than 1 percent.\n\nGroh-Wargo criticized Kemp, who resisted calls to step aside as secretary of state while running for governor, for doing a poor job of helping counties address such problems. Abrams had also blasted Kemp throughout the campaign for pushing policies \u2014 some of which were halted by the courts in the past two weeks \u2014 that made it harder for people to vote. She\u2019d called him the \u201carchitect of voter suppression.\u201d\n\nIn the wee hours of Wednesday, when his lead was closer to 51 percent, Kemp told supporters at his election night party that the \u201cmath is on our side\u201d and that he expected to win. Kemp\u2019s campaign did not respond to requests for comment later Wednesday.\n\nAbrams, addressing her supporters around 1:30 a.m., did not concede but signaled that she expected the race to go to a runoff. To those voters who didn\u2019t support her or didn\u2019t vote at all, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a chance to do a do-over.\u201d\n\nSonam Vashi in Georgia contributed to this story.", "", "\n\nDan Crenshaw delivers a victory speech alongside his wife, Tara, on May 22 in Houston.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) speaks during the Women\u2019s Convention in Detroit on Oct. 27, 2017. (Anthony Lanzilote/Bloomberg)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nWelcome to the start of the 2020 presidential race. If Democrats look at their impressive wins in governors\u2019 races (despite losing in Ohio), suburban wins in the House and a huge gender-gap advantage coupled with some big disappointments for high-profile progressives, the arguments for candidates in the mold of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) or Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) look weaker Wednesday morning. (House candidates whom Sanders campaigned for batted only .500, with five wins and five losses.)\n\nWhen you look to the Rust Belt and Upper Midwest, moderate Democrats such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and former vice president Joe Biden look like they could duplicate wins in gubernatorial and Senate races in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Watching the close-but-no-win races in Florida\u2019s governor\u2019s and Texas\u2019s Senate races, Democratic primary voters may be nervous about nominating a fast-rising liberal such as Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.); former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick\u2019s more moderate image may convince Democrats that he\u2019s the safer pick. The biggest takeaway for Democratic primary voters for 2020 should be: Not just any candidate is going to win, certainly not a progressive star who can be painted as a far lefty and will struggle in purple states. The question should be: Who is going to keep all those suburban voters in the Democratic fold?\n\nOn the GOP side, there was bad news for those hoping for an improbable primary victory over President Trump. The GOP is becoming redder, more rural and more akin to a Trump cult by the minute. You very well may see the stampede of women, moderates, suburbanites and college-educated voters out of the party. Does a reform-minded moderate such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich have a chance in this GOP? It\u2019s hard to see how. And, given the number of new red-state Republicans in the Senate whom Trump helped win, it\u2019s hard to see any real opposition building from the right, either.\n\nNow it\u2019s possible a devastating report from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III or an economic downturn \u2014 if the economy weren\u2019t so strong, can you imagine how many more House seat would have been lost? \u2014 would weaken Trump\u2019s grip on the party. But after Tuesday, the GOP looks more Trumpian than ever.\n\nAnd that does raise the prospect of a third-party or independent candidate running in the center-right lane. The prospects for such a candidate depend largely on what Democrats do. The great middle of the electorate from center-right to center-left is looking for a political home. They\u2019re certain at this point that the GOP in the grip of Trump is not for them. If Democrats do run a Midwest or Rust Belt moderate \u2014 or a competent governor or ex-governor from the coasts (e.g., Patrick or Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee) \u2014 they may be rewarded with a broad-based coalition that provides an electoral college win (comprised of the coasts, the Upper Midwest and the Southwest).\n\nIf, however, Democrats over-interpret the House victories and ignore the kind of Democrats who won in the suburbs and in numerous governors\u2019 races, they might be tempted to go with a candidate who chases those suburban, college-educated and white women voters away \u2014 giving an opening to a Kasich or other middle-of-the-road Republicans or ex-Republicans to seize the vast middle.\n\nIf nothing else, midterms remind us how diverse the country is and the limits of turn-out-the-base elections when you need to operate outside deep-red and deep-blue locales. A presidential candidate will need to scoop up all the diverse segments of the electorate whom Trump has made perfectly clear have no home in the GOP.\n\nRead more:\n\nMegan McArdle: Both Democrats and Republicans are losing this culture war\n\nMax Boot: The battle with Trumpism is just beginning\n\nTom Toles: And now Democrats need to play the long game: Helping younger Americans\n\nJennifer Rubin: Republicans pay the price for racism and xenophobia\n\nGreg Sargent: Three of Trump\u2019s biggest fables died last night\n\nJennifer Rubin: Democrats take House as voters give Trump a big thumbs down", "\n\nBryce Harper is giving up social media for a week.

At least not for the next week.\n\nThere\u2019s no wrong time to take a break from social media, but Harper may have picked an especially good one, as speculation about where he\u2019ll play in 2019 and beyond continues to heat up ahead of next month\u2019s Winter Meetings.\n\n\u201cSocial Media fast starts now,\u201d Harper wrote Tuesday on Instagram. \u201cJoin me on #teamnoscroll for the next 7 days or whatever you are feeling to really open your eyes to everything else around you!\u201d\n\nThe real test will come if some team improbably signs Harper over the next week and he\u2019s forced to hold off engaging with his million-plus Instagram followers. Harper announced his fast along with a photo of himself with Russell M. Nelson, the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Harper, a devout Mormon, met Nelson while attending the LDS General Conference in Salt Lake City last month with his wife, Kayla. Earlier this year, Nelson challenged the LDS church\u2019s youth to give up social media for 10 days. He called on Mormon women to do the same last month.\n\n[Nats' offer to Bryce Harper was biggest free agency deal in U.S. sports history.

(Hey, sign me up.)\n\nMeanwhile, Harper\u2019s agent, Scott Boras, isn\u2019t taking a break from hyping his client to potential suitors. During an appearance on SiriusXM MLB Network Radio on Tuesday, Boras said Harper could \u201cadapt to first base\u201d should a team with a crowded outfield, such as the Yankees, want to move him there. Boras also reiterated what a rare talent Harper is, given what he\u2019s accomplished through his age 25 season.\n\n\u201cYou look at, for example, those who have done what Bryce has done: 180 home runs, he has a particular OPS and/or slugging measure, on-base percentage measure,\u201d Boras said. \u201cYou go through these things and you find out the only players who have done what he\u2019s done to reach those levels of performance, every one of them is a Hall of Famer. . . . So you get to say to everyone involved, this is what we\u2019re dealing with. We\u2019re dealing with something that has rarely come along. You can look at age 22 performance \u2014 only like Joe DiMaggio \u2014 or you look at walk rates and home runs \u2014 only like Mickey Mantle.

(Photo by Charlotte Kesl for The Washington Post)\n\nFor many outside observers, the U.S. midterm elections were a stark reminder of how different the American political system is from their own \u2014 and how strange it can seem in comparison. There was widespread confusion among non-Americans, for example, about how Democrats could lose Senate seats though they won more total votes.\n\nBut if the vote showed off the quirks of the U.S. electoral system, the midterm elections also took a small but notable step in bringing the American system more closely into line with international norms. And, perhaps somewhat surprisingly, that step came from Florida.\n\nOn Tuesday, a clear majority of Floridians voted for a ballot initiative that could potentially restore voting rights to as many as 1.6 million ex-felons. The proposal, listed as Amendment 4 on the ballot, means that felons who have completed their full sentences would be given the vote again, with the exception of those convicted of murder or a sexual offense.\n\nWith almost all precincts reporting, the amendment passed with 64 percent in favor and 36 percent opposed.\n\nThe idea that all felons could be automatically barred from voting, with exemptions requiring individual petitions, is unusual even within the United States \u2014 only three other states (Kentucky, Iowa and Virginia) have similarly stringent laws, though many states have less extensive restrictions on felons voting. But it\u2019s only by comparing such a ban to the practices of other developed democracies around the world a sense emerges of how out of line this policy is with international norms.\n\nFor example, take Europe. According to a 2006 study by the American Civil Liberties Union, \u201calmost half of European countries allow all incarcerated people to vote while others disqualify only a small number of prisoners from the polls.\u201d There are certain countries that block those currently incarcerated from voting \u2014 Britain, for example \u2014 though they largely have narrower restrictions than American states do.\n\nWhat\u2019s really different about the system in the United States, however, is that these restrictions can apply even after people convicted of felonies have served their complete sentences. In a state such as Florida, that could have meant that those convicted of a felony would lose their voting rights \u2014 even if they did not actually serve any jail time.\n\nGlobally, that is unusual \u2014 extremely unusual. Indeed, finding another country that allows a similar level of felon disenfranchisement is difficult. Armenia was once held up as the only country with restrictions that were similar, but the country amended its constitution in 2015 to allow more convicts to vote. Belgium and Luxembourg automatically restrict the vote for some convicts, but this rule applies only to those given the highest sentences \u2014 sentences that are handed out rarely when compared to the United States.\n\nAnother important practical factor means that the U.S. laws on felons voting have more impact: The United States has the highest incarceration rate of any developed nation. In fact, it\u2019s not even close. The United States imprisons people at more than double the rate of the next closest country: Turkey. In a populous state such as Florida, this means that roughly 10 percent of the adult population is eventually barred from voting \u2014 and a considerably higher proportion of the black adult population, given higher rates of incarceration among for African Americans.\n\nActivists and academics have long noted how strange the U.S. approach to felon disenfranchisement was when compared to other countries around the world. \u201cWe know of no other democracy besides the United States in which convicted offenders who have served their sentences are nonetheless disenfranchised for life,\u201d Human Rights Watch wrote in a report released two decades ago. It said the United States \u201cmay have the world\u2019s most restrictive criminal disenfranchisement laws.\u201d\n\nIndeed, to find a comparable system, you cannot just look over borders \u2014 you need a history book. In a 2004 paper, scholars Jeff Manza and Chistropher Uggen noted that \"the closest parallels [to the U.S. system] are to various pre-modern political regimes\u201d in Ancient Greece and Rome, as well as medieval Europe.\n\nThe American system may be a relic of another era, too. In Florida, the decision to bar ex-felons from voting dates back 150 years to the aftermath of the Civil War \u2014 historians say the motivations behind the law were openly racist, designed to stop whites from losing their political dominance to newly eligible black voters.\n\nThe U.S. electoral system is decentralized by design, with the 14th Amendment allowing each state to make its own rules about the right to vote. But the success of Amendment 4, as well as separate reenfranchisement efforts in Virginia, suggest that America might be able to iron out some of its election quirks and become more in line with other advanced democracies.\n\nRead more:\n\nHow to explain to someone living abroad that Democrats can have over 10 million more Senate votes and still lose", "", "", "\n\nBryce Harper did not reach terms during a negotiating session with the Nationals last month. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nCARLSBAD, CALIF. \u2014 The Washington Nationals offered Bryce Harper a long-term deal on the last day of the final homestand of the 2018 season. He did not take it.\n\nAccording to multiple people familiar with the negotiations, the Nationals discussed terms for a new deal with Harper and his agent, Scott Boras, throughout September. Those conversations led to what one person called \u201can aggressive offer,\u201d that two people called \u201chistoric. That offer included no opt-outs, and was less than the $400 million some have speculated Harper could receive, according to a person with direct knowledge who would not disclose the exact terms. The following day, The Washington Post reported the offer was for $300 million over 10 years.\n\n[Nationals\u2019 offer to Bryce Harper was biggest free agent deal in U.S. sports history. What now?]\n\nPeople on both sides of those conversations have incentive to suggest it was a hefty sum: The Nationals have incentive to dispel any notion of their frugality with a legitimate offer. Team Boras has incentive to suggest Harper already has an unprecedented offer on the table, so as to generate even larger ones from other teams. Boras said he considered the offer represented a legitimate effort on the part of the Nationals, not the kind of just-for-show offer a team might make for appearances' sake.\n\nBecause Harper was under contract with Washington at the time, the team held exclusive negotiating rights with the former MVP. The Nationals tried to take advantage of that opportunity to strike a deal before Harper hit the open market. They have not yet made one.\n\nNationals General Manager Mike Rizzo addressed Harper\u2019s situation Tuesday here at the general managers' meetings, saying only, \u201cWe took advantage of our exclusivity late in the season\u201d to negotiate with Harper but \u201ccouldn\u2019t reach a deal.\u201d\n\n[Bryce Harper will be the talk of GM Meetings, but Nationals have plenty of other business]\n\nThat the sides did not agree does not rule out a reunion. Harper can explore pitches from other teams, well aware of what the Nationals have to offer, and decide from there. Boras always seems to circle back to the Nationals and other high-spending teams before finalizing any deals for major free agents, and he would almost certainly do so again with Harper, given Harper\u2019s ties to Washington.\n\nBut that they did not agree likely means the Nationals will have to engage in the kind of bidding war they often try to avoid if they want to keep their superstar. Teams such as the St. Louis Cardinals, San Francisco Giants and Philadelphia Phillies have far more money to spare and fewer luxury tax concerns than Washington, which has now crossed that threshold two seasons in a row and is determined not to let the streak go to three.\n\nThat the Nationals made an offer establishes their interest in keeping Harper but does not necessarily clarify the extent of that desire. They could, if they wish, make an offer they know another team will beat, a move that would make them appear interested but not require actual commitment.\n\nBut people involved with the process indicated the front office held a genuine interest in consummating a deal with Harper. If Harper does not sign, the Nationals could still use an Opening Day outfield of Juan Soto, Victor Robles and Adam Eaton \u2014 a far cheaper option.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m comfortable with the alternative [to Harper re-signing],\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cBut I\u2019m uncomfortable with the statement that we\u2019re a better team without him.\u201d\n\nRizzo admitted the Nationals will have to make their own decision on Harper at some point, even if Harper hasn\u2019t made a decision on them. If he does not sign with them, they will allocate their financial resources elsewhere \u2014 and with plenty of holes to fill, they cannot afford to sit around and wait for the market to pass them by.\n\n\u201cIt behooves us to have an expiration date,\u201d Rizzo said, though he also indicated that he and his staff are negotiating with players on \u201cparallel tracks\u201d to cover all possibilities.\n\nFor years, those within the industry have speculated what it would take to lock down Harper, with no grand consensus other than he will likely command more than the 13-year, $325 million contract Giancarlo Stanton agreed to with the Miami Marlins in 2014. Harper has indicated that he would like that kind of long-term deal.\n\nBarry Svrluga contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nBryce Harper will be the talk of GM Meetings, but Nationals have plenty of other business\n\nAwaiting larger-than-life contract, Bryce Harper surprises wife with Backstreet Boys concert\n\nNationals' Max Scherzer and Juan Soto named finalists for top baseball awards\n\nTrevor Rosenthal, healthy again, eyes high-leverage role for the Nationals\n\nNationals make Bryce Harper a qualifying offer before deadline", "After a post-election caucus meeting in 2010, a despondent House Democrat angrily labeled Nancy Pelosi \u201cthe face that defeated us.\u201d\n\nThe first woman ever to serve as speaker, Pelosi had overseen a historic 63-seat loss amid a barrage of Republican ads that pilloried her as a San Francisco liberal and lambasted the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\nYet Pelosi refused to step aside and continued leading Democrats, even after coming up short in three more elections, and late Tuesday night she marched on stage with a new label: the face of victory.\n\nOn a night when Democrats suffered losses in the Senate and in some marquee governor\u2019s races, Pelosi\u2019s House Democrats delivered a resounding midterm triumph that hands them the majority and all the power that entails.

Moreover, no one has ever gone eight years between losing and then reclaiming that coveted gavel.\n\n\u2018I know the ropes\u2019: Pelosi makes her case for leader as Democrats chase House majority\n\nDemocrats will formally nominate their candidate for speaker after Thanksgiving, so Pelosi will spend the next few weeks trying to firm up her support and chart a course for how she would lead the newly empowered Democrats in their confrontations with Trump.\n\nShe took a call from the president shortly before midnight, after she had spent most of Tuesday pledging to find some issues on which to work with him and vowing to fight him on others where Democrats are opposed. Her daughter, documentary filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, followed Pelosi around, filming moments throughout the day.\n\n\u201cWe will strive for bipartisanship, seeking common ground, as we are responsible to do,\u201d she told the crowd of supporters earlier in the evening. \u201cBut when we cannot find that common ground, standing our ground.\u201d\n\nThe victory, for certain, tasted sweeter for the chocolate-loving leader because Democrats used the increasingly popular ACA, once derided as Obamacare by Republicans, to their advantage. She repeatedly kept candidates focused not on the latest Trump scandal, but on the GOP effort to repeal the law and eliminate provisions such as a ban on insurers increasing rates for consumers with preexisting health conditions.\n\nOn the eve of Tuesday\u2019s vote, she sent one final reminder not to take the bait from Trump on a culture war. \u201cDemocrats have kept the focus on the health and economic security of the American people,\u201d she wrote Monday in a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter to her caucus.\n\nRepublicans and their allied super PACs made Pelosi the central villain of attack ads against Democrats, more so than in 2010, but the effort fizzled. Trump was a much bigger factor in the election than Pelosi, according to polling.\n\nPelosi\u2019s internal Democratic critics have questioned her effectiveness after so many electoral defeats. They regularly talked about a new generation of leadership, passing the torch from her and the other septuagenarian leaders, Reps. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) and James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), to a new crop of ambitious Democrats who have been itching to take more power.\n\nAnd those critics came from each direction.\n\nRep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.) charted the course for winning in Trump-leaning districts in his special election victory in March, vowing not to vote for Pelosi for speaker. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) heralded the rise of a more aggressive liberal wing that saw Pelosi as too timid for these Trumpian times with her upset victory in New York\u2019s primary in June.\n\nThis new majority, when all the races are called, is likely to be the smallest since 2001, when Republicans held the edge by a handful of seats. It will be dramatically smaller than the nearly 30-seat margin Pelosi had in 2009 and 2010, her last years as speaker.\n\nHer biggest selling point, so much experience, also had been considered her biggest weakness, particularly in an era when a reality TV show star can win the presidency and a 28-year-old former waitress like Ocasio-Cortez can topple a 20-year incumbent.\n\nBut these are very turbulent times, and with Democrats losing ground in the Senate, and no clear national party leader otherwise, Pelosi is going to sell herself as a steady hand who knows how to deliver.\n\n\u201cWe want somebody who\u2019s been to the circus before,\u201d said John Lawrence, her chief of staff during her four-year stint as speaker, which began last decade. \u201cIt is not a job for on-the-job training.\u201d\n\nIn final pitch to suburban voters, it\u2019s GOP talk on economy vs. Democrats on health care\n\nTo win back the gavel she will require a majority, at least 218 votes, probably all from her side of the aisle, and after that she will have to balance the needs of those new freshmen trying to win reelection in swing districts and liberal upstarts demanding constant confrontation with Trump.\n\nLawrence sported a \u201cMadam Speaker 2007\u201d pin Tuesday night, a memento from the day Pelosi broke the House\u2019s glass ceiling and was sworn in as speaker almost 12 years ago. Back then some Democrats viewed the Bush White House as complicit in a war crime for initiating the Iraq War under the mistaken pretense that Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime had weapons of mass destruction.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to move straight to impeachment,\u201d Lawrence recalled.\n\nInstead, Pelosi empowered her committee chairmen to conduct deep investigations into the administration. She brushed aside impeachment resolutions like those brought by then-Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio).\n\nIt\u2019s instructive for how she will probably handle the far left flank of her caucus on matters involving Trump. By 2008, as the economy collapsed, voters felt comfortable handing the White House to Barack Obama and giving Democrats massive majorities on Capitol Hill.\n\nPelosi will want to replicate that effort to create an easier path to a Democratic victory in the 2020 presidential campaign. \u201cThe first thing we have to do for voters is to demonstrate that we can be trusted with the levers of government,\u201d Lawrence said.\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "\n\nDespite a bad start for his Wizards, Scott Brooks isn't feeling the heat. (Al Drago/Associated Press)\n\nDALLAS \u2014 As usual, Scott Brooks walked out of the locker room and stood in front of a blue Washington Wizards backdrop. After every game, the head coach has to share some sort of insight about his team\u2019s play and eight times in the first 10 games of this season, Brooks has had to answer for a loss. There have been so many sterile defensive performances and so much evidence of disturbing apathy, that on Tuesday after the latest defeat, Brooks simply played the hits.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one way to do it and it\u2019s doing it together,\u201d Brooks said following the Wizards' 119-100 loss to the Dallas Mavericks, using a familiar battle cry from previous defeats.\n\n\"Staying together, doing it together and believing in each other,\u201d Brooks continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here before. We have enough in our locker room.\u201d\n\n[Wizards are too slow to pick up their pace in loss to Mavericks]\n\nDespite the horrendous start for a team that expected to contend in a LeBron James-less East, it appears Brooks, in his third season as the Wizards' head coach, has more than enough collateral within the organization to remain protected from social media uprisings and hot-seat rumors. He also has the unwavering support of his players.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a guy who\u2019s coming in and doing a job like the rest of us,\u201d Markieff Morris said. \u201cSh-- happens. You take losses but it\u2019s like, we started like this before. You know what I\u2019m saying? We\u2019re just trying to find it.\u201d\n\nEven more, Brooks has the security of working in Washington.\n\nThe NBA can be brutal for the well-dressed man at the front of the bench. In Cleveland, Tyronn Lue was fired only six games into the season. Luke Walton is currently coaching the Los Angeles Lakers but his boss, Magic Johnson, is reportedly growing impatient. It\u2019s never a good thing when \u201cprivate\u201d meetings with the president of basketball operations become public.\n\n[Magic Johnson says he won\u2019t fire Lakers Coach Luke Walton unless something \u2018drastic\u2019 happens]\n\nIn just about any other NBA market, a 2-8 start from a veteran team that has been together too long to be this disjointed might cast serious doubts on the job security of the easiest target, the head coach. But in Washington, things are different. The coach is safe here.\n\nThis is not simply because the Wizards have already batted down the non-story of Brooks not being in the line of fire. No, Brooks will likely remain the Wizards' leader because:\n\nHe\u2019s guaranteed $21 million from an organization that has soared past the luxury tax despite its roster holes. He heads a revamped staff with only one longtime assistant experienced in taking over head coaching duties. Most of all, he works for an owner who may be willing to press the eject button on his NHL coaches but practices the patience of a monk when it comes to making changes to his basketball operations.\n\nIn 2016, when the Wizards wooed Brooks, they went all in. Five years, no options, all guaranteed. Brooks would be the voice through the all-star primes of Bradley Beal and John Wall. Such a long-term commitment didn\u2019t come cheap. Brooks signed for $35 million, giving him one of the highest base salaries among NBA coaches.\n\nBut let\u2019s say an alternate universe exists: If Washington can\u2019t pull out of this funk and the organization goes against its long-held ethos of standing pat, Brooks would still be owed the whole shebang while the team places the interim tag on someone on his coaching staff.\n\nOver the summer, the Wizards lost veteran assistants Sidney Lowe and Chad Iske to Detroit and Charlotte, respectively. They were replaced by Robert Pack and Ryan Richman, a young coach who\u2019s in his first year at the front of the bench after spending the last few seasons in player development. That leaves top assistant Tony Brown. Though Brown served as an interim head coach in the 2015-16 season with the Brooklyn Nets, he led that rebuilding team to a 11-34 finish.\n\nThere was a time when team majority owner Ted Leonsis did approve Flip Saunders\u2019s in-season firing, but that move was akin to placing a bandage over a bullet wound during the dreadful 2011-12 season. Saunders was 49-115 and the team ranked 21st in the league in home attendance. The disillusionment within the fan base was hard to ignore. The team had to do something. And yet, it took a 2-15 start for Leonsis to do it when Washington Capitals' coaches had been discarded for far less.\n\nSince the Alex Ovechkin era started in 2005, three Capitals coaches have faced the fate of in-season firings. Last season, Barry Trotz, who had won two Presidents' Trophies for the best regular season record, was nearly fired twice (in November and March) before the Caps went on to win a third straight Metropolitan Division title and then the Stanley Cup. The Cup win triggered a clause in Trotz\u2019s contract that gave him an automatic two-year extension with only a modest raise, far below his value on the open market, and he instead chose to resign. The Capitals promoted his top assistant, Todd Reirden, who would have gotten the head job earlier had Trotz not saved his job by winning during the regular season.\n\nOn the basketball side, however, Leonsis has shown unprecedented loyalty.\n\nLast fall, Leonsis gave Ernie Grunfeld a contract extension despite the 538-686 franchise record he has amassed in his 15-plus years as the Wizards' lead executive. Under Grunfeld, Washington has advanced to the playoffs eight times but has never made it past the second round. This season, his current roster does not appear deep enough to contend in the East. The bench yet again has been wildly ineffective while playing without a starter and the team\u2019s fourth-highest paid player, Ian Mahinmi, has received two consecutive DNPs.\n\nBut these days, a second-round playoff exit doesn\u2019t look so bad with the Wizards getting smoked by 19, the fourth blowout loss this season, to a rebuilding Mavericks team.\n\nIn the second quarter, the Wizards fell into a 20-point deficit and Brooks stood several steps away from the sideline, watching over his offense. Morris was called for a foul and as the whistle blew to change possessions, Brooks smacked his hands and retreated to his seat. That seat, despite the outside speculation, is far from hot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to ignore when you have social media and the world we live in and everybody making rumors about it. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 you hear it,\u201d Beal said, admitting that he\u2019s aware of talk about Brooks\u2019s job security.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on TV, people are talking about it. No truth to it at all,\u201d Beal said. \u201cBut you never really pay attention to it because he comes in and he works every day. He\u2019s here every day. I\u2019m not saying this as a good thing but we\u2019ve been in this position before. We\u2019ve dug ourselves out of this hole before. He\u2019s a well-experienced coach. He\u2019s played in the league. He\u2019s coached an unbelievable team in [Oklahoma City] and now he\u2019s coaching us and trying to get us to that level. So you\u2019ve got to respect what he\u2019s done.

(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News)\n\nCalifornia voters defeated a pair of statewide ballot initiatives Tuesday to repeal a year-old gas tax increase and to allow cities and counties to expand rent control, measures designed to address two of the state\u2019s most pressing problems.\n\nThe defeat of Proposition 6, which would have nullified a 12-cent-per-gallon tax increase that legislators passed in 2017, was the more surprising loss. The measure had served as a symbol of high-tax California and helped energize a state Republican Party that has faded as a political force over the past two decades.\n\nThe proposition was rejected by 55 percent of voters, after polls showed it as too close to call heading into Election Day. The tax increase is projected to raise $52 billion over the next decade for roads, highways and bridges, projects the proposition\u2019s opponents said would be in jeopardy if voters repealed it.\n\nRural parts of the state, where traffic is lightest, largely supported a repeal. But urban voters plagued by round-the-clock \u201crush hour\u201d traffic killed it.\n\nThe rent-control measure \u2014 Proposition 10 \u2014 appeared doomed heading into Tuesday\u2019s election, and nearly 62 percent of voters opposed it. The initiative would have effectively repealed a 1995 law that limits local jurisdictions\u2019 ability to impose rent control on single-family homes and to set the rent once an apartment becomes vacant.\n\n[In East Palo Alto, residents say tech companies have created \u2018a semi-feudal society\u2019]\n\nThe measure\u2019s proponents, including Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D), cast it as a nod toward strengthening local control at a time when many of California\u2019s urban areas are experiencing housing shortages,skyrocketing rents and rampant homelessness.\n\nBut a well-financed opposition, led by California\u2019s powerful real estate and apartment-owner interest groups, argued that the measure would stifle home and apartment construction at a time when supply is short. Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom (D) opposed the initiative, as did the influential building trades association.\n\nIt also appeared that a ballot measure in Santa Cruz that would have expanded rent control also did not achieve the majority vote it needed to pass. Rent-control advocates say more such measures will appear on local ballots in the years ahead.\n\nBut a San Francisco ballot initiative to raise revenue to address a spiraling homeless crisis by taxing businesses did pass. Proposition C, which would raise an estimated $300 million for homeless programs, split the tech community in the city and pit Marc Benioff of Salesforce, who favored the measure, and Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey, who opposed it, against each other in the run-up to the vote.\n\nMayor London Breed (D), who has made addressing homelessness a priority of her new administration, opposed the initiative, arguing that it would discourage businesses from moving into the city. The measure is likely to draw a legal challenge in the coming months.\n\nIn East Palo Alto, a city squeezed by the expansion of nearby tech companies that bring jobs but no housing, voters appeared to approve their own \u201ctech tax.\u201d Measure HH would impose a tax on large office space and put the money toward affordable housing and job training programs.\n\nThe measure needed two-thirds of the vote to pass, and it appeared to have achieved that with the majority of votes counted.\n\n[San Francisco turns to simple street solutions that underscore the city\u2019s complexities]\n\nBy early Wednesday, House races in the state appeared to boost Democrats\u2019 majority by a net of three seats, although demographic changes and recent voting trends had raised their hopes for a better result.\n\nIn a Democratic flip, businessman Harley Rouda appeared to defeat Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R). Rohrabacher, whose affinity for Russian leader Vladi\u00admir Putin puzzled many in his party, had represented his southern Orange County district since 1988. Rouda won a little more than 50 percent of the vote.\n\nDemocrats also picked up a seat viewed as a test of their ability to win over working-class Democrats who had been voting Republican. Homeless advocate Katie Hill defeated Rep. Steve Knight (R) in a district representing northern Los Angeles County.\n\nIn the race to fill the seat vacated by Rep. Darrell Issa (R), Democrat Mike Levin remained ahead of Republican Diane Harkey with more than half of precincts reporting. Levin is an environmental activist.\n\nBut Republicans appeared to be holding onto three other heavily contested seats. In the race to succeed Rep. Edward R. Royce (R), former state Assemblywoman Young Kim defeated Democrat Gil Cisneros in an Orange County district the Democratic Party had considered winnable.\n\nRep. Jeff Denham (R) also appeared to hold onto his Central Valley seat, and Rep. Mimi Walters (R) held off Democrat Katie Porter to win a third term.", "\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, reacts after voting results during a House Democratic election night event in Washington on Tuesday. (Yuri Gripas/Bloomberg News)\n\nFor the first time since 2010, Democrats will lead the House of Representatives when the 116th Congress convenes early next year \u2014 while Senate Republicans will have padded their 51-seat majority by a few more, leaving them far below a filibuster-proof margin of 60 votes.\n\nWhat does it all mean? Here are four takeaways from Tuesday night\u2019s results.\n\n1. It\u2019s not always the economy, stupid\n\nMidterm elections offer voters a chance to hold the president\u2019s party accountable \u2014 typically for the state of the economy under the president\u2019s watch. But with a strong economy and unemployment at its lowest in nearly a half-century, these elections were a referendum on Trump\u2019s presidency. The results display a deeply divided electorate. City and suburban dwellers rejected the president\u2019s inflammatory behavior and xenophobic policies; rural voters embraced him.\n\nThe result is a split-screen Congress. Democrats registered their opposition with record turnout in blue and purple districts, electing a record number of women, including several women of color, to take control away from Republicans for the first time in eight years. Across the Hill, Trump notched a major win by expanding his majority in the Senate by at least a couple of seats.\n\n2. Democrats will investigate more than legislate\n\nVoters have handed Democrats significant power to investigate any alleged wrongdoing by Trump and his administration. Democrats can thank Republicans for changing House rules in 2015; now most committee chairs can unilaterally issue subpoenas without consulting the minority party.\n\nDemocrats will surely use this unfettered authority to investigate Trump\u2019s family businesses, ethics charges against several of his Cabinet members, and Trump policies such as the Muslim travel ban and separating migrant families at the border. Depending on the course of the Mueller investigation, the House Intelligence Committee is likely to toughen its oversight of the Trump campaign\u2019s conduct in the 2016 elections.\n\n3. A more polarized Congress as the GOP moves further right and the Democrats further left\n\nThe elections have deepened the divide between the parties.\n\nBoth House and Senate Republican conferences will look a lot Trumpier in the new Congress.\n\nIn the Senate, Trump will rightfully claim credit for bolstering GOP numbers. Since Trump all but put himself on the ballot, we should not expect to see much daylight between him and the new GOP senators. With a wider margin and more conservative conference, centrists Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska lose their pivotal status; on most issues, Republicans will not need their votes to make a majority.\n\nIn the House, Republicans primarily lost seats in purple suburban districts, many of which had voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. That leaves the smaller GOP conference redder and closer to the president. But it still has some moderates \u2014 which means, now that Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) is retiring, the GOP\u2019s leadership contests may be even more complicated.\n\nSenate Democrats, meanwhile, move left. Losing red-state Democratic colleagues means Democratic leader Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) will not have to accommodate as broad a mix of electoral interests. Expect Democrats to stick together to oppose Trump\u2019s nominees and GOP proposals more uniformly.\n\nOn the House side, the new Democratic speaker \u2014 maybe Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) \u2014 faces a tougher leadership challenge. Just as we saw when Democrats regained control of the House in 2006 and lost it in 2010, the new Democratic majority is built on Republican turf. A decade ago, Pelosi called these members her \u201cmajority makers.\u201d Similarly, the next Democratic speaker will, on the one hand, need to meet the demands of the party\u2019s base not to cooperate with the president \u2014 while, on the other, ensuring new members from purple districts can satisfy their own constituents. Finding issues and bills that unite a broad array of Democrats will be the key challenge for Democratic leaders.\n\n4. Gridlock anyone?\n\nStalemate is common when parties split control of Congress. Indeed, as shown in the figure below, split-party congresses (1981-1986, 2001-2002, 2011-2013) face legislative stalemate more frequently on salient issues than do congresses with unified or completely divided control.\n\nSo will the two parties make deals to pass laws? That seems, shall we say, unlikely, given the increasingly polarized parties and an approaching presidential election. Trump seems unlikely to move to the center to push for new investments in infrastructure or a resolution on immigration. Democrats could be wary about cutting taxes on the middle class without raising them on the wealthy, and a Democratic House will oppose limiting entitlement spending. Nor is a split-party Congress likely to agree to a congressional budget. That means Republicans will not be able to keep resorting to reconciliation bills \u2014 which cannot be filibustered \u2014 to advance measures with a simple majority.\n\nThat said, Congress will have to make at least some deals. The government is expected to hit its debt ceiling in early March. And a new spending deal will be needed to lift tough budget caps on domestic and defense spending come fall 2019. How Trump and Congress decide to exploit these must-pass bills remains to be seen, but the sausage-making is unlikely to look or smell very good.", "\n\nDefender Taylor Kemp, shown in 2016, missed this past season with injuries.

Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nDemocrats lost to President Trump in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio in 2016. Tuesday, they were delighted to see that the 2016 losses might have been an aberration. Consider that Democrats held on to all four of the Senate seats, flipped the governorship in Wisconsin and Michigan, and held the governorship in Pennsylvania. The only loss was the Ohio governorship. (More about that in a moment.)\n\nDemocrats in these states ran on health care, education and other bread-and-butter issues. They didn\u2019t have to adopt Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant claptrap, nor did they change their views on social issues. In other words, they had a clear message, appealed to a wide audience and were able to put together an electoral majority of college-educated whites, younger voters, women and nonwhites \u2014 President Barack Obama\u2019s winning coalition. Perhaps the problem wasn\u2019t the Democratic message of economic opportunity and fighting for the little guy but a presidential candidate in 2016 who just didn\u2019t connect with voters and a campaign that dropped the ball. Lesson: You can keep the message, not give in to xenophobia, and still win in the Rust Belt and upper Midwest with a down-to-earth candidate.\n\nDemocrats should also look at where they fell short in a very winnable governor\u2019s race \u2014 Richard Cordray in Ohio. Corday is a progressive darling but couldn\u2019t maximize the strength of the Democratic coalition. You could see why moderates in the suburbs might shy away, concerned about electing a \u201ctax and spend\u201d progressive, while young and nonwhite voters might not find him all that compelling. Lesson: Be really wary of nominating a Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) type who is going to scare moderates and fail to generate excitement with nonwhite voters, who must turn out in large numbers to ensure a win.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats also flipped governorships in New Mexico, Maine, Kansas and Nevada. Three of the winners were women, who have reaffirmed their importance to the party\u2019s electoral future. None of these states would have been won, most likely, by a fire-breathing progressive. In these states, competent moderates, especially in Nevada and Kansas, were able to effectively paint the Republican as extreme. (In the case of Maine, the outgoing governor, a Trumpish clown, likely encouraged voters to give the other party a turn.) Lesson: Women are some of the Democrats\u2019 best candidates, and in states where being \u201cmiddle of the road\u201d is no insult, it\u2019s a good idea to go with a moderate.\n\nAs for the House, here again moderates did extremely well. Third Way, which promotes centrist Democrats, put out an election eve memo on House candidates, which laid out the results of an election eve poll that \u201casked Democrats and Independents to think about the Democratic candidate in their district and asked if they would have preferred a more liberal, moderate, or conservative option.\u201d The survey found: \u201cA plurality (37%) would not have preferred anyone different. Thirty-five percent would have preferred a more moderate (21%) or conservative option (14%). Just 16% said they would have preferred a more liberal candidate.\u201d\n\nThird Way also makes an interesting point: Although some national Democrats rushed to join Sanders in support of single-payer health care, only one Democrat in a competitive House race actually campaigned on it. However, \u201cRepublicans, by contrast, ran ads attacking Democrats in over two dozen competitive districts on this issue, including against Democrats who never actually supported it. That\u2019s how potent they found it: they lied about their Democratic opponents backing the plan to score political points. And many Democrats who had been pressured into supporting single payer in the primary quickly retreated from it in the general election.\u201d Moreover, the survey found, \u201c70% of Democrats and Independents want the Democratic Party to \u2018appeal to a broad range of voters, including people who may have voted for Trump in 2016.\u2019 By contrast, just 17% of Democrats and Independents want the Party to move farther to the left in an effort to generate enthusiasm and participation among progressives and liberals.\u201d\n\nSure enough, after the votes were counted, Blue Dog PAC (another centrist Democratic group) welcomed a slew of new members to the House: including Anthony Brindisi (New York\u2019s 22nd District), Max Rose (New York\u2019s 11th District), Mikie Sherrill (New Jersey\u2019s 11th District), Abigail Spanberger (Virginia\u2019s 7th District) and Jeff Van Drew (New Jersey\u2019s 2nd). Democrats also ran \u2014 with great success \u2014 likable moderates in suburban districts against vulnerable Republicans. Lesson: Moderates don\u2019t have to be boring, and outside of deep-blue enclaves, it\u2019s entirely logical to avoid overreaching.\n\nTwo final, big lessons remain for Democrats. First, exciting progressives Andrew Gillum, Stacey Abrams and Beto O\u2019Rourke came up short, although they ran remarkably competitive races. (Abrams does have an outside shot at a runoff.) Democrats need to continue to expand the electorate, engaging and registering young people but most critically, Hispanic voters. Making such voters into reliable, regular voters should be the party\u2019s top priority.

This week, he and the Falcons will face a Cleveland Browns defense that ranks as the second-worst against the run, per Pro Football Focus, with 139 rushing yards allowed per game (fourth-most).\n\nNick Mullens, QB, San Francisco 49ers\n\nMullens took an NFL game snap for the first time ever and completed 16 of 22 passes for 262 yards and three touchdowns against the Oakland Raiders last Thursday. This week Coach Kyle Shanahan named him the starter for Sunday\u2019s game against the New York Giants. He will get the pleasure of throwing against the league\u2019s fifth-worst pass-coverage unit while only having to face a pass rush that languishes in the bottom third of the NFL (23rd).\n\nPer SportRadar, 49ers QB Nick Mullens averaged 2.46 seconds from snap to throw last week, the 2nd-quickest time of any NFL QB who has played at least one full game this season (min. 20 throws).\n\n\n\nDrew Brees is the quickest on average among QBs with multiple starts: 2.57 seconds. \u2014 David Lombardi (@LombardiHimself) November 5, 2018\n\nTrey Burton, TE, Chicago Bears\n\nBurton\u2019s 71-percent overall catch rate has earned the trust of quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, especially in the red zone where Burton is tied with Travis Kelce in red-zone receptions (seven) among tight ends and leads the team with four touchdowns inside the 20-yard line.\n\n\n\nTrey Burton catches a touchdown in the red zone\n\nSit\n\nAll Redskins skill players\n\nWashington\u2019s depth chart at the start of the season featured an offensive line of left tackle Trent Williams, left guard Shawn Lauvao, center Chase Roullier, right guard Brandon Scherff and right tackle Morgan Moses.

And that\u2019s in addition to Williams needing a few more games to heal from thumb surgery and Moses (knee) listed as day-to-day.\n\n[Despite rash of injuries, not everyone is giving up on Redskins\u2019 NFC East title hopes]\n\nEven with a healthy offensive front the Redskins allowed their rushers to be stopped at or behind the line of scrimmage over 21 percent of the time (23rd) and quarterback Alex Smith to be pressured 84 times over 308 drop backs. And when he is pressured, his passer rating drops from 103.2 to 55.3 this season.\n\n\n\nAlex Smith's passer rating in 2018\n\nKerryon Johnson, RB, Detroit Lions\n\nJohnson has been underwhelming this year. Detroit\u2019s lead back had eight carries for 22 yards against the Seahawks in Week 8 and then 12 carries for just 37 yards against the Vikings in Week 9. Sure, he adds a few receptions per game but not enough to make him fantasy relevant.\n\n[The players with the best matchups for Week 10]\n\nPlus, this isn\u2019t the week for him to get his stuff together: Chicago\u2019s defense is giving up the third-fewest rushing yards in the NFL at 84.9 yards per game and boasts the league\u2019s top run-stopping unit per Pro Football Focus.\n\nDoug Martin, RB, Oakland Raiders\n\nMartin has carried the ball 51 times this season with 24 of those carries occurring in the last two weeks in relief of an injured Marshawn Lynch. He\u2019s performed well despite no touchdowns but it\u2019s unclear how many opportunities he will get on Sunday against the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nThe Chargers are a nine-point favorite over the Raiders this week, implying Oakland will be trailing more often than not.

I\u2019d love to get a blizzard every year.\n\nAnd I can\u2019t forget the summer trips to drop my son off at William & Mary. The energy level was always high with the students returning for another school year. I walked around in the heat and humidity, shooting plenty of warm and fun summer scenes. I can fill a book with my summer photos.\n\nThe Easter visits in spring were also very nice. My wife and I would meet my son for brunch, and I always made time to photograph the newly planted colonial gardens and the various blossoms popping out around town. Some of those visits were frosty, while others were quite warm. Spring is a fickle season in the Mid-Atlantic region.\n\nWell, with all that in mind, I must say I like all of the seasons.

And he intends to push to end America\u2019s support for a Saudi-led coalition waging war in Yemen.\n\nDemocrats may restart Congress\u2019s Russia probe into interference in the 2016 election. They could also push for investigations into Trump\u2019s trade war with China and ties to Saudi Arabia.\n\nBut they may well find themselves pushing back against a president who becomes even more aggressive in his foreign policy approach, since he will have trouble moving domestic legislation through Congress.\n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be the first [president] to turn to foreign policy\u201d after a midterm loss, Haass said. But since Trump has already charted a very independent foreign policy, Haass is not sure how different that would look.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s stymied domestically, it would possibly increase his view that foreign policy is a domain where he can \u2018get things done.'\u201d Haass said.

Legitimacy crisis. \u2014 Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) November 6, 2018\n\nBut the Senate popular vote is a bogus stat for a whole host of reasons. It\u2019s true that the Senate isn\u2019t set up particularly favorably for Democrats \u2014 there were 30 red states in the 2016 election and 20 blue ones, and the many small red states such as Wyoming have the same number of senators as exponentially more populous blue states such as California and New York \u2014 but the Senate popular vote is not a stat that tells that tale.\n\nThe biggest problem with it is that not every state is up for reelection, leading to a skewed picture. If more Democratic seats are up for reelection, it stands to reason that Democrats will do well in the popular vote. And that\u2019s exactly what happened in 2018: Democrats were defending 26 states, and Republicans just nine.\n\nThe second reason is California. It has a unique system in which the top two candidates advance to the general election, regardless of party. This year, that was two Democrats. That means all 6 million votes counted (with many more to come) go to the Democrats. Given California is by far the biggest state, that badly skews the national \u201cSenate popular vote.\u201d And in fact, the exact same thing happened in 2016, which was a big reason it was a highly misleading stat then, too.\n\nLet\u2019s assume there are eventually 9 million votes in California\u2019s Senate races. If we apply the results of Tuesday\u2019s governor\u2019s race \u2014 Democrats' 59.5 percent to Republicans' 40.5 percent \u2014 that would give Democrats 5.3 million votes and the GOP 3.7 million. If you alter the numbers from the first tweet above to include this very plausible partisan split in California, Democrats' national \u201cSenate popular vote\u201d edge would be reduced to 36.8 million to 35.2 million \u2014 a pretty even split.\n\nBut that\u2019s not quite it. There\u2019s also this: While Democrats lost seats on Tuesday night, they actually won most of the races that were held \u2014 at least 22 of the 35 seats, and possibly a couple more. That\u2019s 63 percent or more of the seats, despite winning just 55 percent of the vote.\n\nSounds pretty unfair to Republicans, right?", "\n\nEli Manning may not be starting for the Giants in Week 11, but he needs to be in your Week 10 fantasy lineup.

Good luck in Week 10.\n\nMismatch of the week\n\nMatt Breida, RB, San Francisco 49ers\n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget, since they just had their bye week after a one-game sample, but the Giants dealt away their best run-game weapon before Week 8, sending Damon Harrison to Detroit. And \u2014 again, one-game sample \u2014 they proceeded to let Adrian Peterson run wild. After allowing 3.95 yards per carry to RBs all year, the Giants gave up 5.7 to Peterson (5.6 to all Washington RBs). Meanwhile, San Francisco was working its way toward a full-fledged backfield committee with Breida and Raheem Mostert, but Mostert\u2019s injury in Week 9 leaves the 49ers with Breida, all-but-forgotten Alfred Morris and pass-catching fullback Kyle Juszczyk. Breida gets a few extra days to get healthy heading into what should be a tasty matchup for the running back.\n\nGood situations\n\nEli Manning, QB, New York Giants\n\nOn the one hand, Manning might not be long for the starting job in New York. On the other, from a fantasy perspective, Manning has been a bit underrated. He\u2019s averaging 297.1 passing yards per game. That is, believe it or not, the second-highest average of his 15-year career. Meanwhile, his touchdown percentage is down to 2.54 percent, easily the lowest number of his career. Assuming the former stays high, the latter has to rise. That\u2019s how it works. No, Manning isn\u2019t very good anymore, but having Odell Beckham Jr., Saquon Barkley, Sterling Shepard and Evan Engram to catch passes can make up for a lot of deficiencies. Against a San Francisco team with a 42.7 pass-coverage grade (easily the lowest in the league) and a 42.3 tackling grade (second-lowest), regression could hit for Manning this week.\n\n[Bill Belichick was either ripping Aaron Rodgers or coaching really well. You make the call.]\n\nDuke Johnson Jr., RB, Cleveland Browns\n\nHe exists! Whether it was the new Browns coaching staff or simply a good player being good, Johnson finally produced in Week 9. He came into the game with 50.0 PPR points on the whole season, then put up 29.6 against the Chiefs. Sometimes, if you see a breakout game, it\u2019s okay to be hesitant about a full long-term investment, but with Johnson, we have a full 2017 of data that says he can do this. And making it even better for Johnson is the fact that, after a 2017 when he was the fourth-most-targeted running back, he gets to face a Falcons team that has allowed the most receptions to running backs this year \u2026 and last year \u2026 and 2016 \u2026 and 2015.\n\nMaurice Harris, WR, Washington\n\nI\u2019m not about to recommend Harris as a long-term fantasy add, even in the wake of Paul Richardson going on injured reserve. But for Week 10, he makes for an intriguing DFS option. He had 12 targets against Atlanta Sunday, the first Washington receiver to top seven targets in a game all season. He leads the position group in yards per route run at 1.47 (Richardson is second, at 1.11; the rest of the team\u2019s receivers are 1.00 or lower). And with Richardson definitely out and Jamison Crowder a question mark at best, there is less competition \u2014 not to mention the fact that Washington might not be able to carve room for Adrian Peterson to run, given the team\u2019s offensive line situation. Against a Tampa Bay team allowing 1.8 receiving TDs to receivers per week, Harris has a good shot at finding the end zone.\n\nC.J. Uzomah, TE, Cincinnati Bengals\n\nWith A.J. Green out for at least this game, the Bengals will need to look for offense elsewhere. Tyler Boyd should be the main beneficiary (he is a must-play) but, given he\u2019s already averaging almost 8 targets a game, there\u2019s only so much room for growth. The rest of the Cincinnati receiver room looks bleak, with second-year disappointment John Ross at 16 targets and a 53.9 PFF receiving grade and the rest of the group (Cody Core, Josh Malone, Alex Erickson) below that. Joe Mixon is the next big name in the offense, but the Bengals face a New Orleans team that might be the biggest pass funnel in the league so far (most PPR points per game allowed to receivers, eighth-fewest to running backs). That leaves Uzomah, the tight end who hasn\u2019t quite filled in for Tyler Eifert as well as some hoped, to take the slack.\n\nBad situations\n\nMitchell Trubisky, QB, Chicago Bears\n\n\u00b7 Teams that have allowed fewer passing yards than the 1,885 allowed by the Bears\u2019 Week 10 opponent, Detroit: Seattle, Jacksonville, Dallas\n\n\u00b7 Teams that have allowed fewer QB rushing yards than the 37 allowed by Detroit: None\n\nTrubisky has been good for fantasy, but he hasn\u2019t actually been that good for football \u2014 he\u2019s only had one game (Tampa Bay) where his passing grade was better than 59.0. He\u2019s only 19th in the league in passing yards, 13th in passing TDs. Trubisky\u2019s fantasy value has been helped greatly by his rushing \u2014 only Cam Newton has more rushing fantasy points among QBs \u2014 and as we noted above, Detroit doesn\u2019t let quarterbacks run much (lest you think that\u2019s entirely schedule-based, they\u2019ve faced Dak Prescott, Aaron Rodgers and Russell Wilson and allowed a total of 27 rushing yards).\n\nKerryon Johnson, RB, Detroit Lions\n\nFirst off, the next running back to top even 60 rushing yards against the Bears in regulation time will be the first to do so this season (Frank Gore ran for 101 against them, but 47 came in overtime). And the next one to score a rushing touchdown will also be the first. To add to that, Theo Riddick\u2019s return renders Johnson much less interesting \u2014 he averaged 18.5 opportunities (carries plus targets) and 17.5 PPR points in the two games Riddick missed, but 13.5 and 10.3 in the six games he\u2019s played. Without Riddick, Johnson\u2019s a mid-range RB2. With him, he\u2019s a flex \u2026 in a neutral matchup, which this isn\u2019t.\n\nCooper Kupp, WR, Los Angeles Rams\n\nKupp returned from injury in a big way in Week 9, with 89 yards and a touchdown to give him six in six healthy games this year (he barely played in another). But against Seattle, I don\u2019t expect Kupp to do that again. He is the Rams\u2019 top slot receiver, running 154 slot routes and seeing 36 slot targets, both team-highs. The Seahawks, meanwhile, allow the second-fewest fantasy points to slot receivers in the league. Yes, Kupp himself scored out of the slot against Seattle in Week 5, but that\u2019s the only slot TD the Seahawks have allowed, compared to 8 to outside receivers.\n\nZach Ertz, TE, Philadelphia Eagles\n\nThe Cowboys have only allowed two touchdowns to tight ends this year \u2014 one Monday night to Jonnu Smith of all people. That said, versus-position numbers, especially for tight ends, can easily be questioned just by wondering who they have played. Here\u2019s the bigger question \u2014 with Golden Tate now in Philadelphia, we don\u2019t know whose target share will suffer. It\u2019s likely they all do to some extent or another. Tate, Ertz and Nelson Agholor have similar 6- or 7-yard average depths of target, which to me says that Alshon Jeffery will be fine, but those three could all cannibalize one another. I would hold off on Ertz in DFS tournaments until we see how it plays out.\n\nDaniel Kelley is the fantasy editor for Pro Football Focus.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nTroy Aikman calls for overhaul of \u2018dysfunctional\u2019 Cowboys\n\nNBA players were as impressed as everyone else by Duke\u2019s rout of Kentucky\n\nCollege basketball is back.

(Yuri Gripas/Bloomberg)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nThe 2018 elections are being widely painted as a \u201csplit decision\u201d for President Trump \u2014 Democrats won the House while losing seats in the Senate \u2014 but this framing actually undercuts just how much there is for Democrats and progressives to celebrate about the results.\n\nThree of the biggest narratives driving our politics now lie in ruins, and their deaths carry important implications for the future of the Trump presidency, public opinion in the Trump era, and the character of our country.\n\nTrump has magical political powers, and his lies are \u201cworking.\u201d\n\nFor a year-and-a-half, many of us who got it badly wrong in 2016 have been in a kind of defensive crouch, assuming that Trump possesses a mystical grasp on public opinion that must mean polls revealing his deep unpopularity are missing something.\n\nThey weren\u2019t missing something, and neither were we. Trump really is deeply unpopular, and that translated into a large rebuke at the polls, in the form of the Democratic takeover of the House, which was driven by a widespread desire for a check on his presidency.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, Democrats have picked up 27 House seats, and may be on track for many as 230 seats when it\u2019s all over. The path to the Dem majority ran through flipping not just blue-leaning suburban districts but also some surprise areas that leaned red. This was made possible by a huge outpouring of money and organizing, as well as good candidates in tough areas, which combined to broaden the map, factors that were undoubtedly driven by a backlash to Trump. As one GOP operative put it, in these elections voters were \u201cchecking \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 when it comes to the president.\u201d\n\nAll this came after Trump escalated the lying to an extraordinary degree. Perhaps most prominently, he (and Republicans) lied relentlessly about the GOP\u2019s desire to protect people with preexisting conditions. The sheer frequency of the lies led some to hand-wring that he was overwhelming our political system\u2019s capacity for absorbing untruths. But exit polls showed large majorities said Democrats would better protect preexisting conditions, and huge majorities of those who ranked health care as most important picked Democrats. Three red states are on track to pass ballot initiatives to expand Medicaid.\n\nTrump also escalated the lying about the migrant caravan, which goes to the second component of the \u201cTrump has magical powers\u201d narrative: That he possesses total mastery over the news cycle. Because he willed it, the elections were magically transformed into a contest about immigration, which, if kept in the headlines, guaranteed a Republican win. Related to this idea is that Trump\u2019s mystical sense of public opinion leads him to speak to real public anxieties about the issue that we\u2019re all missing.\n\nBut by the end, Republicans conceded that Trump\u2019s stoking of xenophobic and racial panic was putting House GOP incumbents in educated, suburban districts in greater peril. Regardless, despite Trump\u2019s best efforts to make the elections all about immigration, it is Democrats who largely set the election\u2019s agenda, by keeping the focus on health care. One analysis found that health care was the most commonly discussed topic in television ads in 45 percent of local media markets this year. And it was the most important issue for voters.\n\nDemocrats have no answer to the nationalist backlash.\n\nTrump tried to turn the elections into a referendum on xenophobic, populist ethno-nationalism, hyping destitute migrants hundreds of miles from the southern U.S. border into a national emergency orchestrated by globalists bent on undermining America from within, and even vowing to end birthright citizenship. Some argued Democrats handed Trump an opening to do this by failing to offer an answer to legitimate worries about immigration and globalization tapped by Trump, as if they were merely stumbling around shouting \u201cAbolish ICE,\u201d giving Trump more fodder to paint them as pro-open borders. This is also an argument that advisers past and present such as Stephen K. Bannon and Stephen Miller love to make.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Democrats focused more on health care than on immigration. But this was a strategic decision (a correct one). At the same time, many Democrats did offer an answer to Trump\u2019s racial nationalism: What you might call inclusive patriotism or civic nationalism, the idea that our national pride should be located in our commitment to political equality and economic opportunity for all, regardless of race, ethnic background or religion.\n\nIndeed, Democrats widely condemned Trump\u2019s race-baiting and xenophobia, stressed their support for sane immigration reform, which entails legalizing millions of undocumented immigrants, and denounced Trump\u2019s inhumanity toward asylum seekers as contrary to American values. In a sense, Democrats offered another answer to Trump\u2019s racial nationalism by fielding a crop of candidates with extraordinary racial and ethnic diversity. Candidates such as Antonio Delgado of New York, the target of one of the most racist ads of the cycle, pulled off surprise wins by showcasing qualifications and merit. Anti-immigrant Kris Kobach went down in Kansas.\n\nIt\u2019s true that this argument is far from settled. The Democratic House must put forth a real immigration agenda. Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign looms as another big test of the Democratic response to the supposedly vaunted nationalist backlash. But last night\u2019s results did showcase a resounding answer to it.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, another key component of Trump\u2019s nationalism \u2014 trade policy \u2014 arguably failed him last night in an important way. Democrats easily won Senate races in Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, and won governorships in the last three of those, including ousting anti-worker Scott Walker in Wisconsin, a tremendous Dem win. It amounted to a remarkable turnaround in the \u201cblue wall\u201d states Trump cracked, supposedly with his emphasis on trade. Trump\u2019s trade wars and theatrical belligerence toward China did nothing for Republicans in \u201cTrump country.\u201d\n\nDemocrats can\u2019t assemble a multi-racial majority to confront Trumpism.\n\nTrump\u2019s advisers and supporters constantly make veiled variations of this argument. They have suggested objections to Trump\u2019s racist, xenophobic and cultural provocations (and his cruel immigration agenda) are confined only to the identity-politics-obsessed left, and that they aren\u2019t merely about galvanizing the blue-collar, white GOP base but also have tacit majority appeal. But it\u2019s hard to square this with what happened last night.\n\nHere some major caveats are in order. Trump\u2019s closing strategy probably did galvanize the white vote in numerous red states, enabling Republicans to win Senate seats in Indiana, North Dakota, Missouri and (probably) Florida. Andrew Gillum\u2019s loss in the Florida gubernatorial race to one of the worst Trumpists in the country (Remember Ron DeSantis\u2019s racial dog-whistling and his attendance at conferences organized by a fellow who believes the \u201conly serious race war\u201d is against whites?) is a terrible blow.\n\nBut, for all the reasons noted above, the results in the House do show a multiracial majority rising up to confront Trumpism. As Ron Brownstein predicted, all those Trump provocations further polarized the country between blue-collar, rural, evangelical Christian and aging white voters on one side, and all those groups on the other side of this cultural divide: Young voters, minorities, and secularized, socially liberal, college-educated and suburban whites, especially women.\n\nThose latter groups helped assemble a majority in the battle for the House. Fueled by enormous turnout for a midterm, Democrats may end up winning the House popular vote by seven points or more. It\u2019s true that this majority ran into a wall of voters on Trump\u2019s side of the divide in red-state Senate races, and it\u2019s an open question whether a longer-term realignment is under way, in which college-educated whites defect to Democrats.\n\nBut, while it remains to be seen whether this anti-Trump majority will endure against him in 2020, it can and did mobilize itself, rising up to put a big check on the Trump presidency \u2014 and on Trump himself.\n\nRead more:\n\nGary Abernathy: Mike DeWine\u2019s moderate approach gives Republicans a gubernatorial win in Ohio\n\nEd Rogers: Democrats won the House, but Trump won the election\n\nKaren Tumulty: The aftershock of Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat has finally arrived\n\nAlexandra Petri: Texas, I see now that you love me and despise this Beto, and I embrace you\n\nE.J.

The data showed that this year, white women split their vote between Democratic and Republican candidates for the House, but they preferred Republican candidates in 2010 and 2014.\n\nThe midterm elections were notable not only for female voters but also for women\u2019s winning power.\n\nDemocrats lost seats in the Senate.

Many female Democratic House candidates who prevailed on Election Day ran in opposition to Trump or his policies. Several were first-time candidates. Republican women like Kristi L. Noem and Marsha Blackburn, on the other hand, made history but were reluctant to mention their gender on the campaign trail, preferring to focus on issues. Though prominent figures like Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida, failed to win their potentially historic elections, many candidates around the country became the first person of their gender, race, ethnicity or sexual orientation to be elected to their positions in their states, or in some cases, in the country.\n\nRashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, both Democrats, are the first Muslim women to win seats in Congress.\n\nDemocrats Sharice Davids and Deb Haaland are the first Native American women to serve in Congress, and Davids is also the first lesbian congresswoman from Kansas, according to CBS News.\n\nAnd Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat, is now the youngest woman elected to Congress.

Until he ate while orbiting Earth in 1962, scientists at NASA weren\u2019t sure humans could swallow and digest food while in space. Luckily, he chowed down in microgravity with no trouble. Today\u2019s astronauts sometimes spend months at a time living in the International Space Station (ISS), so they\u2019d get pretty hungry without a few snacks!\n\nOf course, while the human body is happy to take in a meal while hovering 250 miles above Earth, the process of cooking and eating food isn\u2019t exactly the same as it is back home. That\u2019s why NASA scientists are still working hard to perfect astronaut menus. A healthy diet is even more crucial for space farers than it is here on the surface, because spending time in space makes your body start to lose bone and muscle mass. NASA has to figure out how to send food up in a rocket, store it for as long as possible and make sure it delivers a perfect balance of nutrients \u2014 and it has to keep astronauts from getting bored, too!\n\n\u201cImagine trying to eat the same food for every meal for six months. You may get tired of the food and eat less than you need to maintain weight, health and performance. That\u2019s why we have to make sure there\u2019s a large variety of healthy food available for the astronauts to make choices,\u201d says F. Ryan Dowdy, ISS food system manager at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.\n\nAstronauts have about 200 food items to pick from. According to Dowdy, a lot of the options are surprisingly similar to meals we eat on Earth.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s macaroni and cheese or chocolate pudding cake, it\u2019s important for the astronauts when eating to be reminded of home,\u201d he says. \u201cFood can be an important psychological comfort in the stressful environment of space.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the preparation that\u2019s unique: Food often has to sit in storage for six months before it even goes into space \u2014 and last for weeks or months at a time once it\u2019s up there \u2014 so NASA designs everything with a shelf life of at least two years. Macaroni and cheese is freeze-dried (meaning that most of the moisture is removed, which makes it safe to store at room temperature), and astronauts add hot water to it on the space station. Chocolate pudding cake is preserved similarly to canned food, but NASA puts it in a flexible pouch so it takes up less space.\n\nSome Earth foods are already perfectly fit for microgravity consumption. Tortillas, for example, are a great alternative to bread \u2014 they last a long time in storage, and they don\u2019t form crumbs that float around and get caught in important parts of the ship. Astronauts can also request small quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables whenever NASA sends supplies up, but for the most part, they\u2019re eating various combinations of super-durable stored foods.\n\nAs NASA looks to the future of spaceflight \u2014 with missions to Mars, and perhaps even farther \u2014 the agency has to design even more durable food. It takes almost a year to get to Mars, and astronauts will have to bring food for the journey home, too. Dowdy says NASA is working to extend the shelf life of its foods to around five years, but experiments in space farming are also part of the plan.\n\nAstronauts on the ISS are able to farm plants such as lettuce in small quantities, but Dowdy says it will take some time before this is a sustainable source of calories. He thinks 3-D printed treats may also be on the menu someday soon. One thing is for sure: It\u2019s going to take a lot of scientific know-how to feed the space explorers of the future.\n\nMore in KidsPost\n\nNASA heads back to the moon as a pit stop to Mars\n\nWould you fly in space?

Kendall had been to memorials at synagogues in Juneau and Anchorage, where he lives, in a state that is home to a Jewish population numbering in the couple of thousands.\n\nAnd then he saw the mailer from a local Republican group attacking Jewish state Senate candidate Jesse Kiehl with the image of a man stuffing a fat stack of hundred dollar bills into his suit.\n\n\u201cI was revolted,\u201d Kendall recalled in a phone interview, saying he believed the ad was blatantly anti-Semitic. \u201cJesse is proudly and prominently a member of Juneau\u2019s Jewish community. . . . It is tough for me to process through that and not see an ill intent.\u201d\n\nThe ad was not alone.\n\nIn North Carolina, the state Republican Party depicted Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) with what appeared to be a stack of bills in his hand.\n\nIn a hotly contested race outside Seattle, Republicans illustrated Kim Schrier, a Democratic candidate for Congress who is Jewish, with a wad of $20 bills fanned out in her hands.\n\nIn California, a Republican state assembly candidate tinted his Jewish challenger a shade of green in an ad, adding $100 bills into his grip for good measure.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, a Republican state representative ran an ad that painted Democratic challenger Sara Johnson Rothman with money in her hands. It also dropped Johnson, her maiden name, from the graphic while leaving the one she took from her Jewish husband, Scott Rothman.\n\n\n\nAn ad against Jesse Kiehl sent by the Republican Women of Juneau was seen by many as being anti-Semitic. ((Karla Hart))\n\nAnd national outcry ensued last week after a Republican state senate candidate\u2019s ad against his Jewish challenger in Connecticut was digitally altered in a way to play off classic anti-Semitic tropes. Democratic state Rep. Matthew Lesser was depicted holding a wad of cash in front of him, with a crazed look in his eyes.\n\nThese ads come amid the tense and bitter run-up to Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, as national politics increasingly pivots on fundamental issues of race and identity.\n\n[A reporter unwittingly left a voice mail for a GOP candidate.

But national sensitivity is heightened amid rising reports of anti-Semitism and a turn by some political campaigns toward the type of blatant and overtly racial attacks rarely seen since the 1960s.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some famous Nazi posters that have exactly the same images but with different people,\u201d Omer Bartov, a professor of European history at Brown University and the author of a book examining Jewish stereotypes, said of the recent crop of ads.\n\nThe political advertisements have caused local consternation, as well.\n\nIn Juneau, the mailer attacking Kiehl prompted conversations both within and outside the Jewish community, residents like liberal activist Karla Hart said, sparking media coverage and angry letters to the local newspaper.\n\n\u201cShame on the Republican Women of Juneau for using an anti-Semitic trope in their recent mailer against Jesse Kiehl,\u201d Elizabeth Seliotes Bolling wrote to the Juneau Empire.\n\n[Oprah Winfrey on racist \u2018magical Negro\u2019 robo-call: \u2018Jesus don\u2019t like ugly\u2019]\n\nKendall, the Alaska governor\u2019s chief of staff, said he phoned the group that created the flier, the Republican Women of Juneau, and asked what they were thinking after he was flooded with calls and emails.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to believe it wasn\u2019t intentional,\u201d Kendall said he told them. \u201cBut whatever you do, you need to put out a statement that you condemn anti-Semitism.\u201d\n\nThe group, which did not return messages The Post left for its president and another member, has not put out such a statement, Kendall said.\n\nSqualid & shameful, @RepToddStephens: A digitally altered image of @sjjrothman shows her holding a stack of $100 bills. \"Reject Sara Rothman,\" reads text superimposed on the illustration, dropping her maiden name https://t.co/hpAKUeaaDZ #Pennsylvania #PA151 \u2014 Michael Deibert (@michaelcdeibert) November 1, 2018\n\nSeth Klayman, a North Carolina resident who has a doctorate in Jewish studies from Duke, flagged the Schumer ad when it appeared in the middle of a news article he was reading online.\n\n\u201cImmediately I thought they were, at the very least, rooted in anti-Semitic stereotypes and at worst full blown anti-Semitism on the part of the North Carolina Republican Party,\u201d he said. \u201cI found it abhorrent.\"\n\nDallas Woodhouse, executive director of the North Carolina Republican Party, dismissed questions about the Schumer ad in an email.\n\n\u201cThe question itself, not the mailer, is a racist anti-Semitic smear,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is just one more final disgusting attempt to Kavanaugh Republican candidates and activities. We don\u2019t track people\u2019s religion here or lack thereof.\u201d\n\nHe called questions about the ad \u201cthe single dumbest and most outrageous inquiry I\u2019ve ever had from a member of the media\u201d but did not answer questions about whether the state party had ever run ads against any other candidates with money in their hands.\n\n\n\nA digital ad from the North Carolina Republican Party showed Sen.

(Seth Klayman)\n\nKyle Fischer, a spokesman for the Washington State Republican Party, which sponsored the Schrier ad, said that the ad was meant to highlight her support for costly government policies.\n\n\u201cTo imply that the content of these mail pieces is based on anything other than Schrier\u2019s record of supporting policies that would cost taxpayers billions of dollars is baseless and untrue,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nSchrier spokeswoman Katie Rodihan said Republican ads for other candidates in Washington did not feature the same imagery. (Fischer did not answer a question about whether the party had run ads that showed any other candidates with cash in their hands.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an outrageous characterization of a candidate that draws on centuries old anti-Semitic stereotypes,\u201d she said. \u201cKim\u2019s whole platform is focused on lowering costs for families. This is a complete mischaracterization.\u201d\n\nThe Republican National Committee did not respond to a request for comment. In Connecticut, the ad run by Republican state Senate candidate Ed Charamut has caused some hard feelings within the party.\n\n\u201cAs a Jew and as a Republican, I was very dismayed, I was very disturbed by the content of that mailer,\u201d Leora Levy, the Republican National Committeewoman for Connecticut, said in an interview.\n\nShe said she would not support Charamut or anyone who sent similar material.\n\n[Ted Cruz debates a puppet dog as he fights to save his Senate seat]\n\nThe ads come as political rhetoric has been examined for what some see as overt signs of classic anti-Semitism, with conspiracy theories about Jewish financier George Soros directing an \u201cinvasion\u201d at the southern border becoming a prominent theme in conservative politics in recent weeks.\n\nPresident Trump told reporters last week that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised\u201d if the unfounded conspiracy theory were true.\n\nBartov, the Brown professor, said that these narratives echoed classic Nazi propaganda that tried to paint Jews as both capitalists and revolutionaries seeking to subvert the social order.\n\n\u201cMuch of the rhetoric is about how the left is going to destroy everything, destroy the economy, bring this invasion of barbarians \u2014 all of this was very much part of fascist and Nazi xenophobia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s this combination of things: speaking about them undermining order on the one hand, bringing in hordes of invaders, and on the other hand, manipulating the economy.\u201d\n\n\n\nMailer sent by Republican Connecticut state Senate candidate Ed Charamut against opponent Matt Lesser.

There are two branches of this Italian pizzeria in the District, so pick your location based on the atmosphere you want: The original spot in Shaw, with its subway-tile walls and kitchen jutting up against the dining room, is loud and buzzy, while the newer Southeast restaurant, with huge windows offering views of the Anacostia River and a patio on the boardwalk, is more relaxing and spacious.

Bindaas\u2019s colorful Foggy Bottom outpost feels like a celebration before you\u2019ve even reached your table. The menu is inspired by Indian street food, and this is not a place you\u2019ll leave hungry: Even the snacks, such as the cumin-scented roasted sweet potatoes and the bowl of shrimp bezule, are enough for two to share, before you get to the savory lamb kathi roll or bao-style buns filled with lamb or vegetable stew. Couples probably want to avoid the communal table, but seating at or near the bar is actually more quiet than being in the heart of the action.

The music playing at low volume is a jazzy piano tune, not Ethiopian pop. The dining room\u2019s a looker, too, with modern Ethiopian art on the walls and columns decorated with the Amharic alphabet. Ethiopic is especially welcoming to newcomers who may not be well acquainted with the traditional East African cuisine: Knives and forks are available for those who\u2019d rather not eat with their fingers, and the minced-beef kitfo might not be as fiery as at smaller spots.

It could be described that way because the character of Wallace, who is in hiding when \u201cOutlaw King\u201d begins, makes a brief appearance in the new film, which tells the story of Wallace\u2019s contemporary, Robert the Bruce, played by Chris Pine beneath a salt-and-pepper beard and an unflattering mullet.\n\nTechnically, only a part of Wallace shows up here, after he has been captured by the English and drawn and quartered for his disloyalty to the crown. It\u2019s one arm and part of his chest, a grisly warning of more violence to come in this bloody \u2014 and bloody awful \u2014 historical epic that reunites Pine with his \u201cHell and High Water\u201d director David Mackenzie.\n\nThis tedious slog through the highland muck should win no Oscars, only groans and raspberries. Even the much-buzzed-about glimpse of a nude Pine, as his character emerges from a lake, doesn\u2019t make this worth watching.\n\n\n\nPine, center, in \u201cOutlaw King.\u201d (David Eustace/Netflix)\n\nRobert picks up the mantle of rebellion against the English monarch King Edward I (Stephen Dillane) and his cruel son (Billy Howle, in a ridiculous bowl haircut that makes Robert\u2019s shag look good by comparison). Reacting to oppressive taxation, the forced conscription of young Scottish men and the imprisonment of his young bride (a fiery Florence Pugh of \u201cLady Macbeth\u201d), Robert takes up arms against England as he slowly recruits other Scottish noblemen to the cause of guerrilla warfare. The film culminates in the 1307 Battle of Loudoun Hill, which was a turning point in the struggle for Scottish independence. In the context of \u201cOutlaw King,\u201d the overlong, overly violent and chaotic scene delivers another form of liberation: ours, from a movie that is a predictable, monotonous and badly written mess.\n\nWhen, for example, the English lay waste to an outlaw stronghold, we hear an English soldier shout, in one of many lines of painfully on-the-nose dialogue, \u201cThis is what you get for supporting Robert the Bruce!\u201d\n\nNoted.\n\nLater, when we watch an ambush, we hear, just as unnecessarily, \u201cIt\u2019s a trap!\u201d\n\nThe screenplay, credited to Mackenzie, Bash Doran, James MacInnes, Mark Bomback and David Harrower, is ponderous and literal, like color commentary from a \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d personality who\u2019s been transferred from the Sports desk to Medieval Warfare.

Photographer: Yuri Gripas/Bloomberg\n\nDemocrats celebrating their new-but-narrow House majority are confronting a hard decision: Whether to work with the Trump administration \u2013 and the GOP-led Senate \u2013 to lower drug costs.\n\nHouse Republicans grappled with exactly this kind of question for six years under then-President Obama, as the president and Democrats urged them to help improve the Affordable Care Act. Republicans refused to cooperate on bills that might have bettered its marketplaces and its other benefits, all because the law\u2019s shortcomings were too good a political weapon with which to keep bludgeoning Democrats.\n\nDemocrats, who gained at least 26 seats in the House with a handful of races yet to be declared, could very well make a similar political calculation when it comes to drug prices under President Trump. The issue is a top concern to voters, and it\u2019s likely to come up in 2020 when Democrats are seeking to defeat Trump to win the White House.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got to make a decision, which is: How far are they willing to go to show they\u2019re willing to work with Republicans and the Donald Trump administration?\" Rodney Whitlock, a former health-policy staffer to Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and now a vice president at ML Strategies, told me.\n\nMinority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who is expected to reclaim the House speakership, has said going after the high cost of prescription drugs is a task Democrats plan to take on right away. In July, Pelosi personally visited the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America to threaten some specific legislative actions, according to Stat News. Last night she told PBS\u2019s Judy Woodruff it\u2019s \u201chopefully something we can do in a bipartisan way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that we could find common ground on reducing the of prescription drugs if the president is serious about his saying that he wants to do that,\u201d Pelosi said, referring to the administration\u2019s surprisingly bold proposal last month to lower the government\u2019s spending on certain Medicare drugs administered in doctors offices.\n\nBut Pelosi, who has given little credit to the administration for the proposal, added a jab to Trump: \u201cHe has pulled his punch on it so far,\u201d she said.\n\nPelosi was referring to a campaign promise by Trump to buck conservative norms and push for allowing Medicare to directly negotiate lower prices with pharmaceutical companies -- a policy with huge potential to move the needle on drug prices that would give the government much more influence over the industry. The president has since backed off that pledge as it\u2019s an idea that alienates many in his own party.\n\nDemocrats are certainly poised for one type of action: Launching multiple investigations of Trump and scrutinizing his policies on immigration, education, Russia -- and health care, as my colleague Karoun Demirjian writes.\n\nBut if anything is to get done legislatively in the next two years on drug prices -- which are much higher in the U.S. than in other developed countries -- it would take House Democrats and Senate Republicans working in tandem with the administration, which has spent the last six months pushing drug costs as a top priority.\n\nAny feasible, bipartisan legislation would likely take the shape of tweaks to Medicare or changes to the laws surrounding the rebates drugmakers give to pharmacy benefit managers, who are widely blamed for putting upwards pressure on list prices.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) could become the next Finance chairman. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nSome House Democrats have introduced more aggressive bills aimed at the drug industry. Reps. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.) have been especially active on the issue. So has Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), who is poised to become chairman of the House Oversight Committee. Cummings has proposed legislation allowing Americans to import drugs from Canada and permitting direct Medicare negotiations.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar didn\u2019t back either of those ideas in the drug pricing blueprint HHS and the White House released last spring. But the administration did propose an unusually aggressive idea last month, announcing it would experiment with pegging Medicare drugs dispensed by doctors to an index based on drug prices in other countries.\n\nIt\u2019s an idea you\u2019d expect Democrats to support since the Obama administration attempted something similar. But as we\u2019ve noted, Pelosi and other leading Democrats expressed only tepid support, appearing unwilling to give any ground to the administration just weeks before the election. Now, on the other side of the midterms and with the House majority firmly in hand, Democrats will be seriously considering how to engage onthe issue over the next two years.\n\nNonetheless, lobbyists are skeptical there will be much bipartisan action on drug prices. \u201cUnlikely,\u201d one GOP lobbyist wrote to me.\n\nOther lobbyists pointed to Grassley \u2013 the most likely senator to assume chairmanship of the powerful Senate Finance Committee from retiring Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah_ \u2013 and his longtime, bipartisan work on prescription drugs. A key architect of Medicare\u2019s Part D prescription drug program, Grassley teamed up with Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) three years ago to investigate steep prices for the hepatitis C drug Solvadi.\n\nOne could imagine Grassley teaming up with Democratic colleagues on pharmaceutical legislation \u2013 assuming, that is, that either party is willing to take actions that would raise the powerful industry\u2019s ire.\n\nAHH, OOF and OUCH\n\nAHH: A Washington Post-Schar School survey of battleground districts on Election Day found health care and the president were the two top issues voters pointed to in House contests.\n\nIn the survey, 43 percent of voters overall said health care was the most or second most important issue to them.

In Missouri, Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill was defeated by Republican challenger Josh Hawley. But in Wisconsin, Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin beat back a challenge from Leah Vukmir, winning a second term, even as the state's Gov. Scott Walker (R) fell in his bid for a third term.\n\nMcCaskill had repeatedly hammered Hawley for being one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit brought by Republican attorneys general that seeks to overturn the ACA. She argued the lawsuit could eliminate the law's provisions that provide protections for people with preexisting illnesses. For his part, Hawley dismissed those attacks and has insisted that such protections can be maintained with an alternative to Obamacare.\n\nAnd in Wisconsin, Walker was forced to answer for his state's participation in the Obamacare lawsuit, calling the claim by his opponent Tony Evers that he wanted to eliminate preexisting condition protections the \u201cbiggest lie of the campaign.\u201d \u201cNo matter what happens in the courts or in the Congress, in Wisconsin we\u2019ll codify that, the exact same language that\u2019s in the [ACA],\u201d Walker had said. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure everyone living with a preexisting condition is covered here in the state.\u201d As our Post colleague James Hohmann reported, Gov.-elect Evers made health care a big issue on the campaign trail, campaigning last month with former HHS secretary Kathleen Sebelius.\n\nHEALTH ON THE HILL\n\nDemocratic candidate for Congress Donna Shalala poses for a portrait on Friday, Aug. 17, 2018, in Coral Gables, Fla.

(Al Goldis/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nNot all of the Republican anti-immigrant cranks lost, but enough of them \u2014 Rep. David Brat (R-Va.), Kansas gubernatorial candidate Kris Kobach, and Senate candidates Lou Barletta (Pa.) and Corey Stewart (Va.) \u2014 got rejected that it might serve as a warning. (Unfortunately, Rep. Steve King of Iowa, among the most blatant race-baiters, hung on to his seat. Shouldn\u2019t Republicans now kick him out of their caucus?) Even for Republicans, there are limits, I suppose.\n\nMore important, Republicans\u2019 wipeout in the suburbs, among women, with young voters and college-educated voters can in part be attributable to the GOP\u2019s turn toward nativism. These groups in poll after poll have all showed high levels of dissatisfaction with President Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric, obsession with building a wall, family separation policy and insistence on stripping \u201cdreamers\u201d of legal protection.\n\nMoreover, 74 percent of voters in exit polls said extremist violence was the most important factor or an important factor in casting their vote for the House. Democrats got 62 percent of those who thought it was the most important factor and won, 51-47, among voters who said it was at least a factor. (A mere 16 percent of Jewish voters cast ballots for Republicans for House races, perhaps a sign that they, too, have figured out that Trump\u2019s nationalism and the party\u2019s not-so-subtle anti-Semitic mailers reveal a party not reflective of their values, no matter how much Trump does for Israel.)\n\nRepublicans have built a party around evangelicals (whom they carried overwhelmingly) and white rural Americans. They still do well with men. But outside the South and deeply red states such as Missouri, Tennessee and North Dakota, the party is in full retreat. In Pennsylvania, Democrats won races for governor and senator, and eradicated the GOP\u2019s 13-5 advantage in the House delegation. It will now be a 7-7 partisan split. (Pennsylvania voters, it seems, were not impressed with Trump\u2019s visit in the wake of the Squirrel Hill slaughter, his harping on the caravan or his insistence on turning up the vitriol after the murder of 11 innocents.) In Virginia, where Democrats won every statewide office in 2017 and picked up 15 House of Delegate seats, the U.S. Senate was a runaway, and Republicans lost three more House seats. Likewise, in Michigan, Democrats won the governorship, held their Senate seat and flipped House seats, in addition to approving a ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana use.\n\nWhen Republicans have to compete outside states with large numbers of evangelicals, their best bet has been to utterly repudiate Trump\u2019s right-wing populism. That\u2019s how Republican governors in Vermont, New Hampshire, Maryland and Massachusetts hung on to governorships. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) had left little doubt about what he thought of Trump. \u201cOutrageous, disgraceful and a divider\u201d was his terse description of the president.\n\nIn 2020, when we again look at the national map, not only for the House but also for the presidency, and when many more blue-state senators will be on the ballot, the extent of the Republicans\u2019 retreat might hit home.\n\nFinally, Republicans pay a price for cultivating white racism in another respect: Their House and Senate delegations become less and less diverse, while Democrats go in the opposite direction. On the Democratic side, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman to win a House seat; Ayanna Pressley will be Massachusetts\u2019s first black female House member; Ilhan Omar from Minnesota is the first Somali American to win a House seat; Deb Haaland from New Mexico and Sharice Davids from Kansas are the first Native American women elected to the House; and Omar and Rashida Tlaib from Michigan are the first two Muslim women to win House seats. Democratic women also flipped governorships in at least four states (Maine, New Mexico, Kansas and Michigan). Democrats elected the first openly gay men to serve as a congressman from New Hampshire and governor of Colorado.\n\nBy contrast, a party whose elected officials remain overwhelmingly white and male might find it increasingly difficult to appeal to an electorate that is becoming more diverse. When 72 percent of voters say they think it\u2019s important to elect more racial and ethnic minorities and 78 percent say it\u2019s important to elect more women, Republicans might want to consider why they have so few nonwhite and female candidates and whether they are leaving votes on the table.\n\nRelated:\n\nRead more:\n\nHere comes Trump\u2019s blame machine\n\nThe first five things the Democrats should do with their House majority\n\nAmerica steps back from the abyss\n\nDemocrats take House as voters give Trump a big thumbs down\n\nThe aftershock of Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat has finally arrived\n\nThe telling measure of Trump\u2019s weakness\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans are losing this culture war", "", "\n\nA scene from the documentary \u201cMonrovia, Indiana,\u201d featuring the town\u2019s Main Street. (Zipporah Films)\n\nMovie critic\n\nRating:\n\nFor more than half a century, documentary-maker Frederick Wiseman has observed American life from a discreet distance, creating visual and aural essays that fall into a felicitous middle ground between reportage and sheer poetry. His films have had impact: Wiseman\u2019s debut, \u201cTiticut Follies,\u201d which exposed inhuman conditions at a Massachusetts state mental-health facility, spurred an outcry for immediate reform. But Wiseman\u2019s films are wondrously free of polemic or explicit agendas, which makes them that much more stealthily effective.\n\n\u201cMonrovia, Indiana\u201d stands as an exceptionally straightforward, four-square example of Wiseman\u2019s strategy. Filmed in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, the film takes viewers to the kind of rural Midwestern town that tipped that race: small (pop. 1,443), largely white, deeply religious and unsure what the future holds in an economic context of technological and cultural change.\n\nRest assured, \u201cMonrovia, Indiana,\u201d never invokes partisan politics. As usual, Wiseman simply trains his camera on what he deems important, creating a closely observed portrait of a community by way of still images and scenes captured on a static, dispassionate camera. The film\u2019s opening scene, of rolling cropland, handsome farmhouses, gentle-eyed cows and empty roads, could easily be accompanied by a soaring score by Aaron Copland. Wiseman doesn\u2019t go in for such dramatics: His only soundtrack is the sound of rustling leaves, chirping birds and occasional conversations among the citizens he keeps at a respectful arm\u2019s length.\n\nThe result is a classic on a par with \u201cWinesburg, Ohio\u201d and \u201cOur Town,\u201d a narrow slice of contemporary American life that manages to be both admiring, yet capable of polite skepticism. Wiseman never takes us into those stately clapboard homes behind neatly trimmed lawns. Instead, he captures life in public, as people go to school, get their hair cut, shop at the supermarket, have a cup of coffee at the corner cafe, wrestle with development issues at a town council meeting and honor a longtime member of the Monrovia Masonic Lodge with a ceremony recognizing 50 years of service. Because Wiseman declines to interview his subjects, a few questions go unanswered, because they\u2019re unasked. There\u2019s an unmistakable subtext to a contentious debate involving a subdivision called Homestead, for example, that\u2019s never fleshed out or explored.\n\nOn the other hand, the lack of people speaking directly to the camera means that the audience will be spared the kind of rambling, self-justifying speeches that pass for too much national reporting in a world gone MAGA. Instead, we\u2019re simply afforded the privilege of watching people whose self-reliance and sense of mutual obligation can also be seen through a lens of insularity; whose spiritual practices are clearly deeply restorative but also self-righteously paternalistic; and whose pride in their roots as the breadbasket of the country is at odds with a Big Agricultural operation that is both a lifeline and a force for creeping alienation.\n\n\n\nResidents of the town chat at the Corner Cafe. This documentary is wondrously free of talking heads \u2014 and partisan agendas. (Zipporah Films)\n\n\u201cMonrovia, Indiana\u201d may not be about politics, but it\u2019s a deeply political film. Rather than probe or interrogate, it presents a carefully crafted image of civic life that, in some ways, reflects society at large and, in other ways, exemplifies what\u2019s being left behind as that society inevitably changes. Like all of Wiseman\u2019s films, \u201cMonrovia, Indiana\u201d possesses almost meditative power. Deliberately paced, it accrues emotion and meaning in direct proportion to viewers\u2019 willingness to let it flow through them and, perhaps, leave them permanently changed.", "bad url", "bad url", "", "", "", "\n\nMembers of the U.S. Army build a razor wire fence around area for tents near the U.S.-Mexico International bridge on Nov. 3 in Donna, Tex.

And while viewers here tried to make sense of the results, they repeatedly stumbled over two numbers: the total votes for Democratic and Republican Senate candidates. More than 45 million Americans voted for Democratic Senate candidates vs. about 33 million for Republican contenders, according to figures updated around 11 a.m. Eastern time Wednesday.\n\nAs the animated TV graphics clearly showed, though, it was Republicans who ended the night in control of the Senate \u2014 not the Democrats. \u201cAn extraordinary electoral system,\u201d tweeted an incredulous state secretary in the German state of Hesse.\n\nSo how could Democrats outpace Republicans by more than 10 million votes and still fall further behind in the Senate? The answer is that there\u2019s really no such thing as a nationwide Senate vote. It all comes down to which states are electing Senators.\n\nAs my colleague Max J. Rosenthal explained, only a third of Senate seats come up for reelection each time there are congressional elections (that\u2019s every two years). This year, 26 of the 35 of the seats being contested were held by Democrats, so more Democratic voters showed up to the polls. A lot of those voters cast ballots in states where Democrats were safe \u2014 think New York, Virginia or Minnesota \u2014 so there wasn\u2019t much media coverage.\n\nThen there\u2019s California. \u201cIt has a unique system in which the top two candidates advance to the general election, regardless of party,\u201d explained The Post\u2019s Aaron Blake. \u201cThis year, that was two Democrats. That means all 6 million votes counted (with many more to come) go to the Democrats. Given California is by far the biggest state, that badly skews the national \u2018Senate popular vote.\u2019\u201d\n\nFrom a European perspective, though, some questions remain \u2014 namely, why set elections up like this and not simply based on the overall popular vote, as is the case in many democracies?\n\nIn the case of the Senate, it goes all the way back to the drafting of the U.S. Constitution in 1789. Creating a new form of government required compromises of all kinds to get enough states to approve the document. One of them was to create a legislature with two chambers, one that gave each state equal representation and one that based representation on a state\u2019s population. Having a Congress solely based on population, which some people argue for today, was one of the stalled ideas that led to this compromise.\n\nThat system remains in place today in large part because it\u2019s part of the Constitution, which is difficult to amend. Opponents wouldn\u2019t be able to change the system simply by passing a new law.\n\nIn other countries, all of this is often seen as evidence that U.S. democracy no longer works properly. \u201cFarewell to the biggest pseudo-democracy in the world,\u201d read a recent headline in Austria\u2019s Der Standard newspaper. It ran atop an opinion piece discussing America\u2019s \u201cunderdeveloped electoral system.\u201d\n\nBut as much as Europeans may be puzzled by those rules, seemingly undemocratic rules are not unique to the United States.\n\nBritain\u2019s electoral system favors bigger parties over smaller ones and still has not gotten rid of its unelected House of Lords, the upper house of Parliament. Germany\u2019s rough equivalent of the Senate, the Bundesrat, also over-represents Germany\u2019s smaller states: The tiny state of Saarland can send three representatives to the Bundesrat, while the country\u2019s most populous state, North-Rhine Westphalia, has only twice as many representatives despite being 18 times more populous.\n\nThe difference between those examples and the Senate, however, is their respective influence. The Senate plays a critical role in the U.S. government, while the upper houses of most European democracies do little to affect policy decisions.\n\nMore on WorldViews:\n\nTrump\u2019s North Korea diplomacy quietly stalls\n\nMigrant caravan: Illegal border crossings have plunged since 2000.

This past summer, this gold mine seemed to be collapsing. Data quality appeared to have suddenly plummeted, with some researchers reporting high rates of inconsistent and even random responses. Until now, researchers have had to guess why.\n\nBy analyzing respondents\u2019 IP addresses, we were able to identify one of the major culprits: respondents, many from Venezuela, using virtual private servers (VPSs) to fraudulently join studies. While the problem is not new, our analysis suggests that it may have spiked in the past several months, potentially undermining hundreds or even thousands of studies. We\u2019ve developed tools to identify fraudulent respondents and to block them from future studies.\n\nHere\u2019s the background\n\nMTurk is an Amazon online platform that allows people to recruit workers (called \u201cTurkers\u201d) from all over the world for brief paid tasks. (Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeffrey P. Bezos, also owns The Washington Post.) Researchers post a request. Turkers accept it, complete the task and are paid a small amount. While MTurk did not start as a platform for conducting social science surveys, researchers increasingly use it because they can rapidly recruit survey participants at a fraction of the cost of traditional platforms. MTurk offers a fairly diverse though still limited sample.\n\nEarly studies suggested that using Turkers resulted in similar- or better-quality data than laboratory studies, student samples and even costly survey firm panels. So it\u2019s little surprise that searching Google Scholar turns up over 15,000 studies mentioning MTurk since 2014.\n\nAnd so researchers panicked when, this past August, a University of Minnesota graduate student, Max Hui Bai, posted a query on a Facebook group for psychology researchers, asking whether anyone else had noticed a drop in data quality. In short: Yes, overwhelmingly so. Scholars from around the world reported abnormalities in their data: Respondents providing inconsistent responses to questions, nonsensical responses to open-ended questions and well-established experiments showing aberrant results. The discussion spread across social media, making it into New Scientist and Wired .\n\nSome researchers suspected that the problems were coming from \u201cbots\u201d (computer code that automatically answers questions) or \u201ccyborgs\u201d (code that automatically answers some questions and has humans answer others). But soon three researchers \u2014 Sean A. Dennis, Brian M. Goodson and Chris Pearson \u2014 determined that international respondents were answering questions intended only for U.S. respondents. These \u201csurvey farmers\u201d falsified data and used Virtual Private Servers (VPS) to make it seem as though they were answering questions from inside the United States. These respondents, some of whom did not speak English well, were more likely to give random responses. All this warped inferences about U.S. voting behavior, public opinion or cultural norms \u2014 and seriously, as at least one study found about 25 percent of its respondents were suspicious.\n\nHere\u2019s how we did our research\n\nWe conducted our own audit of 30 U.S. studies fielded on MTurk since 2013, encompassing 21,418 respondents. Using an IP traceback service ( IP Hub ), we found a severe spike in non-U.S. and VPS respondents since February 2018. This is bad news on two fronts. Not only did we find almost 25 percent of our respondents in a September 2018 study had come from a non-U.S. IP address or a VPS, but also that far more studies than previously thought may have been affected.\n\nPercent of fraudulent respondents in MTurk surveys from 2013 to 2018\n\nOf course, some U.S. respondents may use a VPS to protect their privacy or when they are traveling , rather than to fill out surveys fraudulently. To test how much VPS use is problematic, we fielded two new surveys, covering 2,010 respondents. In both surveys we found that VPS users failed more attention and quality checks than any other group, including those responding from a foreign IP address.\n\nSome researchers suggest that the fraudulent respondents were based in India . We looked at the number of international respondents who apparently forgot to turn on their VPSs, allowing us to see from where they were connecting with the Internet. While a number of connections were from India, making up about 12 percent of the international IPs, even more \u2014 almost 18 percent \u2014 came from Venezuela.\n\nWe also combed online forums for MTurk users and found several Venezuelan Turkers who bragged about subverting the restrictions on international users.\n\nWe also combed online forums for MTurk users and found several Venezuelan Turkers who explained how they were able to get around Amazon controls. One thread, for example, discussed how a worker could have a relative in the U.S. set up an account for them to use; we\u2019ve archived the thread here in case it\u2019s removed.\n\nAll of this suggests that the MTurk crisis may have a surprising root. Venezuela\u2019s economic crisis, with inflation heading toward 1 million percent. Some desperate Venezuelans are using online games to win virtual goods that they can sell for real money. Something similar seems to be happening on MTurk.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nFirst, researchers must follow the standard best practices when conducting MTurk research. That includes setting the \u201cHIT [an MTurk term for \u2018task\u2019] Approval Rate (%)\u201d above 95 percent and the \u201cNumber of HITs Approved\u201d to at least 100 , which substantially improves data quality.\n\nBut that may not be sufficient. We recommend that scholars audit IP address metadata to identify international and VPS users. Researchers should warn workers that their IP location will be checked and that \u201cfarmers\u201d may not be paid.\n\nOur group has developed a software package, available on GitHub , CRAN or as an online app that enables MTurk researchers to audit their own data. We have also developed a Qualtrics protocol for screening out such respondents.\n\nMTurk is too valuable to abandon. Many researchers, especially graduate students, cannot afford other options. But these measures should make a difference.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this post interpreted a different Reddit poster as bragging about subverting MTurk controls using an address in Miami.

(Keith Bernstein/Aviron Pictures)\n\nMovie critic\n\nRating:\n\nFor many years now, Rosamund Pike has elevated nearly everything she\u2019s in, often from the sidelines, whether as the beautiful, good-hearted Jane Bennet in \u201cPride & Prejudice\u201d or the sublimely ditsy Helen in \u201cAn Education.\u201d Her work is so specific, so subtly on point regardless of its placement, that it registers almost subliminally. It\u2019s only in the fullness of time that the viewer realizes it was Pike \u2014 not the nominal star \u2014 who was the best thing about the movie they\u2019ve seen her in.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that Pike hasn\u2019t had her share of lead roles: She has delivered adept, alert performances in such high-profile projects as David Fincher\u2019s \u201cGone Girl,\u201d as well as in smaller roles \u2014 in \u201cA United Kingdom,\u201d \u201cHostiles\u201d and \u201cBeirut,\u201d for example. But \u201cA Private War\u201d is in another league altogether. As the real-life war correspondent Marie Colvin, Pike erases every trace of her delicate natural beauty to deliver the toughest, most uncompromising and vanity-free performance of her career. Finally, one of our finest actresses has been given material that calls on her to utterly transform herself \u2014 vocally, physically, seemingly existentially \u2014 and prove how gifted she\u2019s been all along.\n\n[Here are the 12 movies you should see this holiday season]\n\n\u201cA Private War\u201d begins in 2012, in the rubble of a building that has just been bombed by Syrian forces in the embattled city of Homs. This is where Colvin would meet her death, but the film quickly backtracks to earlier in her career, during which her fearless, swashbuckling temperament draws her to the world\u2019s most scorching hot spots. We see her lose an eye covering the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, after which she affects an appropriately piratical eye patch. Meanwhile, she\u2019s feted by her fellow journalists and living the high life in London, where she writes for the Sunday Times. She chain-smokes, drinks far too much and embarks on a series of ill-fated love affairs, including one with her own ex-husband.\n\nAt one point during \u201cA Private War,\u201d Colvin invokes the World War II correspondent Martha Gellhorn, whose courage and integrity she clearly wants to emulate. But the strength of the movie \u2014 which is based on a Vanity Fair article by Marie Brenner \u2014 is that it doesn\u2019t uncritically accept the comparison. Colvin is propelled by compassion and humanist concern, clearly; unlike her colleagues who focus solely on strategy and statistics, she seeks to make \u201csuffering part of the record,\u201d as she puts it. But she\u2019s also driven by straight-up compulsion and an addictive personality at constant odds with her personal and professional judgment.\n\nDirected by Matthew Heineman \u2014 best known for the urgent, timely documentaries \u201cCartel Land\u201d and \u201cCity of Ghosts\u201d \u2014 \u201cA Private War\u201d is gratifyingly unfussy. Like its subject, it gets to the point, toggling between Colvin\u2019s stints in Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan with her well-heeled life in England. Eschewing fancy camera moves or other attention-getting devices, Heineman handles the transitions gracefully, punctuating the action with shard-like montages of flashbacks and anxiety attacks that eventually send Colvin to rehab for post-traumatic stress.\n\n\n\nPike conveys Colvin\u2019s desires to make war\u2019s \u201csuffering part of the record,\u201d as well as her dangerous compulsion to be close to it. (Paul Conroy/Aviron Pictures)\n\nIt\u2019s during this passage that Pike delivers the most bravura moment of \u201cA Private War,\u201d when she confesses her doubts and contradictions to her trusted photographer Paul Conroy, played in a gallantly self-effacing performance by Jamie Dornan. It\u2019s a quiet, unforced moment \u2014 in which Colvin\u2019s self-mythologizing bravado momentarily gives way to genuine doubt \u2014 all the more powerful for being so simple and unadorned.\n\n\u201cA Private War\u201d suffers from one or two cliches: Colvin actually delivers a solemn reminder that journalism is \u201cthe rough draft of history,\u201d and a scene of one of her breakdowns, when she wanders desperately through her apartment and drinks vodka straight from the bottle, has the unconvincing air of an improv exercise. Such brief missteps aside, \u201cA Private War\u201d gains credibility and assurance as it plays, largely thanks to Pike\u2019s thoroughly inhabited portrayal, which includes an angular, lanky comportment, a stiff, loping gait and a spot-on Long Island drawl that melds easily with the tapes of Colvin\u2019s real-life interviews that open and close the film.\n\nAt a time when the press is regularly labeled the \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d Heineman and screenwriter Arash Amel remind the audience not just of the humanism that drives so many reporters, but also the extreme danger they put themselves in to bring us the truth. Like \u201cFirst Man\u201d before it, this is a movie that examines its heroes not with a tone of vicarious swagger or abject worship, but one that emphasizes pain, sacrifice and often fatal stakes.\n\nTo its credit, \u201cA Private War\u201d doesn\u2019t shy away from the more disturbing questions raised by Colvin\u2019s attraction to risk. As she seeks to banish her demons by engaging in increasingly reckless behavior, it\u2019s clear that she wasn\u2019t just endangering herself, but the colleagues she hectored to go along with her. By the time \u201cA Private War\u201d circles back to Homs, the film has made a strong case for the enormity of the loss of Colvin and Remi Ochlik, the French photographer who died with her. If viewers find themselves grieving and also questioning Colvin\u2019s judgment in that episode, it\u2019s because they\u2019ve been given space to do so by a movie as tough and honest as its complicated protagonist.", "\n\nFrom left: Ah-in Yoo, Jong-seo Jun and Steven Yeun in \u201cBurning.\u201d (Well Go USA Entertainment)\n\nReporter\n\nRating:\n\nLee Chang-dong\u2019s \u201cBurning\u201d initially presents itself as a simple boy-meets-girl tale, set in South Korea. Protagonist Jongsu (Ah-in Yoo), a young deliveryman who passively dreams of putting his degree in creative writing to use, bumps into his childhood friend Haemi (Jong-seo Jun) while she dances outside a discount store to attract customers. They catch up over dinner and sleep together that night, with Jongsu becoming so enamored of the spirited Haemi that he agrees to feed her cat while she travels to Kenya to satiate what she calls her \u201cgreat hunger\u201d for life experience.\n\nAlthough Jongsu fills the cat\u2019s bowl with food each day, he never actually sees the animal, a manifestation of the uncertainty that lurks throughout the film. Gradually, \u201cBurning\u201d begins its descent into thriller territory when Haemi returns from Kenya with Ben (Steven Yeun), a charming, slightly older man who lives in Gangnam and has everything Jongsu doesn\u2019t: money, friends and some sort of romantic relationship with Haemi. Yet despite this, Ben still seems dissatisfied with his life, telling Jongsu that he sets greenhouses on fire every two months for fun: In just 10 minutes, Ben says, he can \u201cburn it all down, as if it never existed.\u201d\n\nBased on Haruki Murakami\u2019s 1992 short story \u201cBarn Burning,\u201d the film is a captivating character study that takes its most poignant scene directly from Murakami\u2019s story. Shortly before a central character goes missing, Ben and Haemi visit Jongsu at his home in the countryside, situated so close to the North Korean border that they can hear the propaganda broadcasts. As Ben and Jongsu relax outside, basking in the dusk light, Haemi begins to dance, swaying to jazz music and removing her top. But her performance is as much for herself as for the two men; she is free of all constraints and, for once, doesn\u2019t feel trapped.\n\n\n\nJong-seo Jun delivers a breakout performance. (Well Go USA Entertainment)\n\nAs the film\u2019s object of desire, the character of Haemi comes close to being a Manic Pixie Dream Girl, but Jun\u2019s performance has enough depth to steer clear of that cliche. Making her screen debut, the actress manages to capture both Haemi\u2019s wide-eyed innocence and her troubled spirit. In one dinner scene, she playfully pantomimes peeling tangerines with as much energy as she brings to a scene in which she bemoans her existence.\n\nJongsu complements her erratic nature, with Yoo\u2019s expressionless baby face deliberately revealing little about what he thinks or feels. He remains hard to read, even when Haemi reminds him that he once crossed the street to tell her she was ugly, before she got plastic surgery. Rage is the only emotion he expresses, as tension builds between the two men. (Tellingly, this theme is shared with the 1939 story \u201cBarn Burning\u201d by William Faulkner, Jongsu\u2019s favorite author.)\n\nBut the standout performance belongs to Yeun, an America-based actor whose presence is commanding enough to shift the entire tone of the film. \u201cBurning\u201d marks his first foray into Korean cinema, and the actor\u2019s quintessentially Western mannerisms add an unsettling dimension to the character of Ben. Yeun can even make a yawn seem menacing.\n\nLee plays the actors off one another to create a compelling exploration of human nature. South Korea\u2019s official Oscar submission, \u201cBurning\u201d culminates in a finale so astonishing that it will sear itself into viewers\u2019 memories for years to come.", "\n\nFlorida voters repealed on Tuesday a 150-year-old ban on voting by felons. (Wilfredo Lee/AP)\n\nIn 1868, Florida\u2019s white elites faced a threat every bit as grave as the Civil War that had ended in Confederate defeat three years earlier. Congress had just forced Florida to rewrite its constitution to allow every man the right to vote. But adding thousands of newly eligible black residents to the rolls would abruptly make whites a voting minority.\n\nThe old guard\u2019s only hope was to somehow ban black voters without violating Reconstruction acts passed by Congress after the Civil War. Huddled in Tallahassee backrooms throughout that cool January, they found just the ticket: a lifetime voting ban on anyone with a felony conviction. Combined with postwar laws that made it easy to saddle black residents with criminal records, legislators knew they could suppress black votes indefinitely.\n\nOr at least for a century and a half. On Tuesday, Florida voted to end that 150-year-old ban by backing Amendment 4, which will return voting rights to more than 1 million Floridians who have already served out their sentences. The amendment garnered 64 percent of the vote.\n\nHistorians say the vote also ends a law with roots so blatantly racist that one state leader later boasted that the postwar constitution would prevent Florida from becoming taken over by blacks, using a racial slur to describe them.\n\n\u201cTheir intent was quite clear: to eliminate as many black voters as possible,\u201d Darryl Paulson, an emeritus professor of government at the University of South Florida at St. Petersburg, told The Washington Post.\n\nThe ban was remarkably effective at doing so, even 150 years later. As of 2016, more than 1 in 5 black Floridians couldn\u2019t vote because of the rule, according to an analysis by the Sentencing Project.\n\n\"We can\u2019t have a democracy with permanent second-class citizens,\u201d Howard Simon, the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Florida executive director, told the Miami Herald.\n\nThe origins of Florida\u2019s ban trace back to the blood-soaked days just after Robert E. Lee\u2019s surrender. As southern states like Florida rejoined the Union, many tried to explicitly ban black voters. Florida\u2019s first postwar state constitution in 1865 only gave the right to vote to \u201cfree white males,\u201d according to a 2016 report by the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nWhite lawmakers had a tactical reason to fear newly empowered black voters. While blacks made up about 45 percent of Florida\u2019s population after the war, thousands of white residents had lost their right to vote over their Confederate ties. By 1867, Paulson found, there were 15,434 black voters registered in Florida and just 11,148 who were white.\n\n\u201cThere was this real fear that blacks would do to whites what whites had done to them for so long, which was to outright discriminate,\u201d Paulson said.\n\nEven as Congress forced Southern states' hand with the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments, which freed slaves and gave them citizenship and the right to vote, Florida legislators laid the groundwork to disenfranchise those black residents. In 1865, the state passed a package of laws known as the \u201cBlack Codes\u201d that upped the penalties for charges easy to pin on freed blacks, including assaulting a white woman, disobedience and \u201cvagrancy,\u201d a crime with such a broad definition nearly anyone could be charged.\n\nThat was the perfect precursor to including a voting ban on felons in the 1868 constitution. Legislators also included a more broad voting prohibition against anyone convicted of more minor \u201cBlack Code\u201d crimes, like larceny.\n\n\u201cFelony disenfranchisement was a way of reducing the effect of the despised black suffrage that Conservatives knew they had no alternative but to accept,\u201d wrote historian Jerrell Shofner in a piece on the drafting of Florida\u2019s 1868 constitution.\n\nThe law was just one among many the state adopted to keep African Americans away from the polls. In 1889, Florida became the first state to adopt a poll tax, charging $2 annually with full knowledge that poor blacks would be disproportionately affected. It later adopted literacy laws and residency rules aimed at cutting out black voters, Paulson said.\n\nThose efforts were astoundingly effective. As little as 3 percent of black Floridians were registered to vote in 1940. By 1961 in Gadsden County in Florida\u2019s Panhandle, there were 12,261 African Americans old enough to vote \u2014 but only seven were registered, according to the Brennan Center.\n\nMost of those outright discriminatory rules ended in the civil rights era of the 1960s, but Florida\u2019s felony voting ban stubbornly continued. In 1968, Florida legislators watered down the rule but kept the ban on felons. When black voters took the state to court, a panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit found there was \u201cracial animus\u201d behind the original law, the Brennan Center noted, and no compelling reason to keep it on the books. But that decision was later reversed by the full court sitting en banc.\n\nMore recently, then-Republican Gov. Charlie Crist eased the rules for many felons to get their rights back, restoring tens of thousands to the electoral rolls. But Gov. Rick Scott erased those reforms in 2011, adding a new five-year waiting period and requiring felons to appear before a clemency board in person to plead their case.\n\nThat has led to a system so bizarre that John Oliver panned it as \u201cinsane\u201d in a recent piece on \u201cLast Week Tonight.\u201d \u201cIt may be the dumbest thing about Florida, which is saying something,\u201d Oliver said.\n\nAs a massive backlog grew of more than 10,000 people waiting to be heard by the clemency board, Scott\u2019s decisions neatly fit the historic patterns of the ban. The Palm Beach Post found that Scott returned voting rights to three times as many white men as black men.\n\nAmendment 4 nabbed more than 1.1 million signatures to land on Tuesday\u2019s statewide ballot and found support from a surprising breadth of backers, from the Koch-funded Freedom Partners to the ACLU. But it did face opposition from mainstream GOP candidates, including Scott, who remains ahead in his Senate bid as of early Wednesday, and Florida\u2019s governor-elect Ron DeSantis. Both argued the amendment was too broad, although it does exclude anyone convicted of murder or sexual crimes.\n\nIn the end, Amendment 4 easily crossed the state\u2019s 60 percent threshold \u2014 a victory that should stand as a rebuke to decades of racial oppression, said Paulson.\n\n\u201cIt has been a real embarrassment for Florida to be the leader in keeping people away from voting,\u201d Paulson said. \u201cThe United States should do everything humanly possible to make voting as accessible as possible to everyone who wants to vote.\u201d", "", "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep.

I think I\u2019m better at that game than they are, actually, but we\u2019ll find out.\u201d\n\nAt her own news conference, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Democrats have a \u201cresponsibility for oversight\u201d but said committees\u2019 efforts would not be \u201cscattershot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll know what we are doing and we\u2019ll do it right,\u201d she said.\n\nJockeying for House leadership positions began in earnest Wednesday. Pelosi is widely considered to be the front-runner to retake the speaker\u2019s gavel, despite dozens of Democratic candidates calling for new leadership during the campaign.\n\nTrump, who demonized Pelosi on the campaign trail, threw his support behind her bid.\n\n\u201cI think she deserves it,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cShe\u2019s fought long and hard. She\u2019s a very capable person.\u201d\n\nOn the Republican side, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (Ohio) said in an interview with Hill.TV that he would challenge Rep. Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) for the role of minority leader. The move, while expected, underscored conservatives\u2019 desire to expand their power within the GOP conference after a bruising election.\n\nMcCarthy announced his bid later in the day.\n\n[Republicans retain control of Senate with candidates who embraced Trump]\n\nLawmakers will return to Capitol Hill next week, and both parties will hold leadership elections this month.\n\nIn a new talking point, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) cautioned Democrats against engaging in \u201cpresidential harassment\u201d in the form of overly aggressive oversight.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats in the House will have to decide just how much presidential harassment is good strategy. I\u2019m not sure it will work for them,\u201d he told reporters Wednesday.\n\nTrump sought to make Tuesday\u2019s elections a referendum on his presidency. Returning to his 2016 campaign playbook, he delivered fiery speeches that drew massive and enthusiastic crowds but were full of falsehoods, invective and demagoguery.\n\nKey suburban districts rejected his pitch, along with most women.\n\nDemocrats won women\u2019s support by 19 points, the largest margin in the history of midterm exit polling, compared with their margin of four points in 2014, according to network exit surveys from CNN. Independent women voted for Democratic candidates by a 17-point margin after narrowly supporting Republicans in 2014. And white women, a reliable voting bloc for the GOP, split their votes evenly between the two parties this year, after favoring Republicans by 14 points in 2014 and by 19 points in 2010.\n\nVoters under 30 also favored Democrats this year by a 35-point margin over Republicans, compared with an 11-point margin in 2014, the polls found.\n\n[Conservatives now wonder if transactional Trump might leave them in the cold]\n\nDemocrats, who picked up at least seven governorships, performed well in several states Trump won. In Wisconsin, Democrat Tony Evers bested Gov. Scott Walker, the onetime Republican star who ran for president in 2016. Even Kansas elected a Democratic governor, rejecting Trump ally Kris Kobach.\n\nBut while the party held onto its Senate seats in West Virginia and Montana \u2014 and picked up one more in Nevada \u2014 it was disappointed elsewhere.\n\nSens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Claire McCaskill of Missouri all lost their seats to Republicans who campaigned as Trump allies. Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), with his reelection in doubt, said Wednesday that his race was proceeding to a recount.\n\nIn some ways, the outcome was similar to that of 2016, with late polls overestimating Democratic enthusiasm and Republicans showing unanticipated resilience.\n\nThe liberal movement\u2019s biggest stars this election cycle struggled against the odds. Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum lost to Republican Ron DeSantis, a Trump ally. In Texas, Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D) failed to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz (R). And in Kentucky, former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath, a Democrat, was defeated by incumbent Rep. Garland \u201cAndy\u201d Barr (R).\n\n[Scott Walker, Wisconsin governor and former GOP presidential candidate, loses reelection bid]\n\nSome Democrats held out hope for Georgia, where gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams refused to concede her too-close-to-call race against Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp. The race might be headed for a recount.\n\nAbrams and Gillum, both African American, confronted some of the most overt racial attacks since the civil rights era as they sought to make history as their states\u2019 first black governors.\n\nRobo-calls in Georgia featured a voice impersonating Oprah Winfrey and calling Abrams \u201ca poor man\u2019s Aunt Jemima.\u201d In Florida, robo-calls mimicked Gillum as jungle sounds and chimpanzee noises were heard in the background.\n\nTrump contributed to the simmering racial tension. Describing himself as a \u201cnationalist,\u201d he vilified a migrant caravan headed slowly toward the U.S. border with Mexico and released a television ad on immigration that was rejected as offensive by the major networks.\n\nTrump also called Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, \u201cnot equipped,\u201d and Abrams, a leader in the Georgia state legislature, \u201cnot qualified\u201d to be governors.\n\n[Meet the 116 women who won their midterms]\n\nThe racial overtones put that explosive form of politics on the ballot, with major stakes for Republicans.

Not so fast.", "Airplane manufacturer Boeing on Wednesday issued a bulletin to airlines worldwide warning of erroneous readings from flight-control software on its planes, after a Lion Air jetliner crashed into the sea soon after takeoff, killing the 189 people on board.\n\nBoeing, which is assisting in an investigation into what went wrong in the Oct. 29 crash of one of its new 737 Max 8 jets, said it issued the bulletin as \u201cpart of its usual process.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday issued an emergency notice to all operators of Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 planes. It warned airlines that erroneous sensor inputs like the one that came into play in Indonesia \u201ccould cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane,\u201d leading to \u201cpossible impact with terrain.\u201d\n\nBoeing\u2019s bulletin was the first indication that an error with the aircraft\u2019s systems may have caused problems for the Lion Air flight, which took off from Jakarta. At takeoff, the plane\u2019s altitude fluctuated dramatically, and the plane increased in speed before nose-diving into the Java Sea 13 minutes later.\n\nIndonesian investigators have recovered the plane\u2019s flight data recorder, which showed that the plane\u2019s airspeed indicator malfunctioned on its last four flights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a stunning simple but deadly error,\u201d said Mary Schiavo, an aviation lawyer and former inspector general of the U.S. Transportation Department. \u201cI can\u2019t even recall the number of accidents I\u2019ve worked where the accident happened the first flight after maintenance. A reported problem, they supposedly fixed it, and then it goes down.\u201d\n\nBoeing\u2019s bulletin said, \u201cThe Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee has indicated that Lion Air Flight 610 experienced erroneous input from one of its AOA (Angle of Attack) sensors.\u201d A misreading in the sensor can cause a plane to dive suddenly.\n\nThe bulletin provided instructions to flight crews on what they can to do correct the sensor\u2019s \u201cfailure,\u201d which it said can happen when the flight is being operated in manual.\n\nIndonesian investigators said Wednesday that an AOA sensor on the jet was replaced the day before the doomed flight, on Oct. 28, when a pilot flying the same aircraft on a different route, from Bali to Jakarta, reported problems with it. The pilot on the crashed Lion Air flight had asked shortly after takeoff to return to the airport in Jakarta but lost contact with air traffic controllers afterward.\n\nThe Angle of Attack sensor, shown to reporters at a press conference in Jakarta on Wednesday, was manufactured by Minnesota-based Rosemount Aerospace Inc. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSchiavo said it\u2019s clear from flight-tracking data that the pilots fought to keep the plane up.\n\n\u201cThe pilots had a battle on their hands for a few minutes,\u201d she said. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t get above 5,000 feet at a time when they should have been over [10,000]. Something happened three to four minutes into the flight. They called to turn back to the airport, but they didn\u2019t call mayday, which means they didn\u2019t have time. They were fighting something.\u201d\n\nIn Jakarta, investigators showed reporters the AOA sensor that was removed from the aircraft. The small black cylinder contains a sensor that controls the angle between the wing and the air it is moving through. If the angle is too high as a plane climbs, that would cause a stall.\n\nThe Boeing 737 Max 8 jets are among the manufacturer\u2019s newest models and have been snapped up by airliners in booming aviation markets, including Indonesia and India. More than 200 are in service across the world, billed as the most advanced of the popular 737 jets \u2014 and capable of flying more than twice as far than the plane that debuted in 1967.\n\nIndonesian authorities would provide Boeing with information from the pilot who flew with the problematic sensor so it could be shared with other airlines , said Nurcahyo Utomo, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Committee.\n\nOny Suryo Wibowo, another investigator, said that it was too early to say what caused the crash. The full investigation could take a year.\n\n[Divers find \u2018black box\u2019 from wreckage of Indonesian Lion Air jet]\n\nThe two Indonesian airlines that fly the Boeing 737 Max 8 planes, national carrier Garuda and Lion Air, both declined to comment on the bulletin. Indonesian officials say that all 11 such aircraft have been tested and declared safe to fly.\n\nThe 787 Max 8 is the second Boeing aircraft to experience serious technical problems soon after its introduction, leading some analysts to question whether Boeing may have overlooked quality concerns as it strives to meet rising global demand. Boeing has been working to increase production capacity at the Renton, Wash., factory where 737s are assembled.\n\nThe FAA grounded Boeing\u2019s entire 787 fleet in 2013 after lithium-ion batteries overheated and caught fire. The National Transportation Safety Board later faulted Boeing as well as its battery supplier, GS Yuasa, for its approach to safety and quality control.\n\nThe Seattle Times reported in August that Boeing\u2019s Renton factory has struggled to meet its production targets amid late deliveries from companies manufacturing its components. The company has sought to increase its production from 47 jets per month to 52 per month.\n\nOn Wednesday, Indonesian officials said the doomed flight would be re-created at Boeing facilities in Seattle to see what role the sensor may have played.\n\nExperts have been puzzled about what could have caused the jet to go down in clear skies, unlike other major airplane disasters in which weather or older jets were major factors. The impact of the crash caused the wreckage to scatter, making it difficult to find and identify the victims. As of Thursday afternoon local time, 51 of the 189 people on board had been identified.\n\nThe data from the flight recorder and Boeing\u2019s statement have provided the first clues, but rescuers are still searching for the device that records voices in the plane\u2019s cockpit. That recorder is expected to provide a clearer picture to investigators of the Lion Air flight\u2019s final moments.\n\n\u201cBoeing has now introduced two aircraft that have had significant problems,\u201d said Henry Harteveldt, an analyst with the consultancy Atmosphere Research Group. \u201cWhat will have to be found is, is Boeing pushing itself too hard? Are the workers moving too fast to meet production deadlines?\u201d\n\nStill, Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said the commercial passengers should not be nervous about getting on a 737 Max 8.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to learn from this just like we learned from the A330,\u201d he said, referring to a 2009 incident in which an Airbus A330 crashed off the coast of Brazil with 228 people on board due to electronics failures. \u201cThe big picture is the system keeps getting safer and safer, and it\u2019s still the safest form of transportation ever designed by humans,\u201d he said.\n\nShibani Mahtani in Singapore and Ainur Rohmah in Jakarta and Aaron Gregg in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nIndonesian divers hear \u2018pings\u2019 as they zero in on Lion Air wreckage\n\nIndonesian authorities recover human remains from area of plane crash\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "", "", "", "Hours before winning a ninth term in Congress, embattled Iowa Republican Steve King barred the state\u2019s largest newspaper, the Des Moines Register, from covering his election night event, calling the paper a \u201cleftist propaganda media outlet.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press reports that King ultimately beat Democratic newcomer J.D.

But Polis\u2019s splash into the history books is all the more significant considering the ugly track record of the state he has been elected to run.\n\nSince the early 1990s, Colorado has played a key role in the battle for LGBT rights. The state was dubbed the \u201chate state\u201d because of a 1992 law that sparked international backlash and boycotts. But the same legislation teed up a landmark 1996 U.S. Supreme Court decision that helped lay the groundwork for marriage equality.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a historic win \u2014 not just for the LGBT community but for the state of Colorado,\u201d Annise Parker, president and CEO of the Victory Fund, a nonprofit group supporting LGBT politicians, told the Denver Post on Tuesday. \u201cThe fact that the state of Colorado, in 25 years, has gone from being dubbed the \u2018hate state\u2019 to a place that can elect someone who is not just openly gay, but publicly gay, that\u2019s historic.\u201d\n\nPolis has been open about his sexuality since arriving in Congress in January 2009. His mother and father founded a greeting card company that later sold for hundreds of millions of dollars, according to the Denver Post.

I think it\u2019s exciting to show how far the LGBT community has come that it doesn\u2019t stand in the way of being elected to the highest office in the state.\u201d\n\nColorado\u2019s ignominious \u201chate state\u201d nickname starts with a fiery Colorado Springs car salesman named Will Perkins. Reacting to city ordinances banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, Perkins and a group of evangelical Christians formed Colorado for Family Values in 1991.\n\n\u201cToo many people have bought into the idea that homosexuality, as they call it, is genetic, that there isn\u2019t anything they can do about it,\u201d Perkins once told a group of followers, according to Denver\u2019s Westword. \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you that there are only two flavors of mankind: male and female. There is no such thing as a homosexual.\u201d\n\nTo combat the legal protections, Perkins and his group launched a ballot initiative called Amendment 2. The referendum claimed anti-discrimination laws granted \u201cspecial rights\u201d to gays and lesbians, and aimed to ban such legal protections.\n\n\u201cThey were talking about not wanting to give gay people special rights, but they were doing it by basically taking away rights,\u201d University of Denver professor Kris McDaniel-Miccio recalled to Westword in 2017. \u201cEverybody held their breath wondering if this was going to catch fire in other states, as well as Colorado.\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 3, 1992, Colorado passed Amendment 2 by 53 percent. An immediate outcry followed from civil rights groups and activists. Celebrities such as Barbra Streisand spoke out against the amendment, according to Westword. In Colorado, business owners outraged over the law called for a boycott of their own state.\n\n\u201cWe have called for a global boycott,\u201d one Denver businesswoman told the Christian Science Monitor in 1992. \u201cDon\u2019t come here for recreation. Don\u2019t come here for business. The governor and the people need to realize that basic civil rights are fundamental. Creating change through a boycott is only one means of demonstrating the power of the people.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Monitor, a month after Amendment 2 was passed, the number of canceled conventions in Denver alone because of the boycott totaled more than $6 million.\n\nEventually a lawsuit was filed against the amendment on behalf of a gay man named Richard G. Evans who worked for the Denver mayor. As the case \u2014 Romer v. Evans \u2014 crawled up the federal court system to the Supreme Court, observers from across the country tuned in because similar proposals were on deck in other states.\n\n\u201cIt was a political issue, in that Amendment 2 was being cloned, so all eyes were on the results of the Supreme Court,\u201d Mary Celeste, a lawyer who worked on the case, explained to KUNC radio in 2016. \u201cIf we lost there, then these initiatives would come forward across the country.\u201d\n\nIn May 1996, the Supreme Court ruled that Colorado\u2019s law was unconstitutional by a 6-to-3 majority. Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy touched on themes that would turn up decades later in his famous Obergefell v. Hodges opinion, the case legalizing same-sex marriage.\n\nRegarding Amendment 2, Kennedy wrote that the law \u201cis at once too narrow and too broad. It identifies persons by a single trait and then denies them protection across the board. The resulting disqualification of a class of persons from the right to seek specific protection from the law is unprecedented in our jurisprudence.\u201d\n\nDespite the eventual implosion of the 1992 amendment, Colorado has also played a more recent part in the struggle for equality.\n\nIn 2012, a cake shop owner in Lakewood, Colo., refused to serve a gay couple on religious grounds. The resulting Supreme Court decision \u2014 Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission \u2014 sided with the business.\n\nMany legal observes watching the 2017 case picked up echoes of the state\u2019s earlier gay rights court battle.\n\n\u201cWhat I find really fascinating about Amendment 2,\u201d McDaniel-Miccio told Westword, \u201cis that we\u2019re reliving it again in 2017.\u201d", "", "In Arizona, voters said no to accelerating the shift to renewable energy. In Colorado, they said no to an effort to sharply limit drilling on nonfederal land. And a measure to make Washington the first state to tax carbon emissions appears to have fallen short.\n\nThe failure of environmental ballot measures in Arizona and Colorado \u2014 and the likely defeat of a proposal to impose fees on carbon emissions in Washington state \u2014 underscore the difficulty of tackling a global problem such as climate change at the state and local level, where huge sums of money poured in on both sides.\n\nEven as a U.N.-backed panel of scientists recently warned that the world has barely a decade to radically cut its emissions of greenhouse gases that fuel global warming, the Trump administration has been busy expanding oil and gas drilling and rolling back Obama-era efforts to mitigate climate change. Environmental advocates and Democratic lawmakers have placed much hope in state and local governments to counter those policies.\n\nBut while Tuesday saw the election of numerous candidates dedicated to climate action, individual ballot measures aimed at the same goal largely foundered.\n\n\u201cWhat we learned from this election, in states like Colorado, Arizona, and Washington, is that voters reject policies that would make energy more expensive and less reliable,\u201d said Thomas Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, an industry-backed free-market advocacy group.\n\nRichard Newell, president of the nonpartisan think tank Resources for the Future, drew a different conclusion.\n\n\u201cThe complexities and politics of the clean energy transition are best navigated through a legislative process, which has been the basis for virtually all significant state level climate and renewable energy policy,\u201d Newell said in an email. \u201cI would not take this as a repudiation of public desire to address climate change, including through carbon pricing or clean energy standards, but rather that the details and who is engaged in the policy formulation matter, a lot. That\u2019s tough to do through a ballot initiative.\u201d\n\nEven in the solidly blue state of Washington, initial results looked grim for perhaps the most consequential climate-related ballot measure in the country this fall: a statewide initiative that would have imposed a first-in-the-nation fee on emissions of carbon dioxide, the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases that drive global warming. While voters in King County, home to Seattle, turned out heavily in favor of the measure, residents across the rest of the state largely opposed it.\n\nOne bright spot for environmental advocates came in Nevada, where voters appeared poised to pass a measure similar to the one Arizonans rejected. It would require utilities to generate 50 percent of their electricity from renewables by 2030. The proposal was leading handily with most votes tallied Wednesday. But before the measure could become law, it has to survive a second vote in 2020.\n\nSince President Trump took office, a handful of states \u2014 notably California \u2014 have vowed to serve as a counterweight on energy and environmental policy to a president who frequently dismisses the government\u2019s own findings that human activity is warming the globe. In September, California codified into law a commitment to produce 100 percent of its electricity from carbon-free courses by 2045.\n\nBut Tuesday\u2019s ballot question results demonstrate the limits to which other states are willing to follow California\u2019s lead \u2014 particularly when campaigners against the proposals emphasize the potential impact on pocketbooks.\n\nSupporters and proponents poured an eye-popping amount of money, more than $54 million, into the fight over the future of energy in Arizona. Only two Senate races in the country \u2014 in Florida and Texas \u2014 saw more spending this year.\n\nThe influx of cash underscores how much both sides believed was at stake. The ballot initiative would have amended the Arizona constitution to require electric utilities to use renewable energy for 50 percent of its power generation by 2035. That might seem easily within reach in sunny Arizona. But the state now gets only about 6 percent of its energy from the sun.\n\nThe state\u2019s biggest utility, Arizona Public Service, or APS, emerged as the most fervent opponent of the proposal, pouring more than $30 million into a political action committee called Arizonans for Affordable Electricity. In an aggressive ad campaign, the group argued that the measure would cost households an additional $1,000 a year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve said throughout this campaign there is a better way to create a clean-energy future for Arizona that is also affordable and reliable,\u201d APS chief executive Don Brandt said in a statement Tuesday evening.\n\nMeanwhile, an alliance of dozens of organizations called Clean Energy for a Healthy Arizona argued that the shift toward cleaner energy will improve public health and create good jobs in the state. The group got a huge assist from California billionaire investor and political activist Tom Steyer, who donated the lion\u2019s share of the nearly $23.6 million raised through the end of September.\n\nTwenty-nine states and the District already have programs known as Renewable Portfolio Standards, or RPS, that require utilities to ensure a certain amount of the electricity they sell comes from renewable resources. But only a fraction of those have targets as ambitious as the ones proposed this year in Arizona and Nevada. For instance, New York and New Jersey also have targets of 50 percent renewable energy by 2030. Hawaii would require 100 percent of its energy to be from renewable sources by 2045.\n\nDuring the 2018 campaign, however, 11 Democratic candidates for governor vowed to try to get all of their respective states\u2019 electricity from \u201cclean\u201d energy sources by the middle of the century, according to surveys done by the state affiliates of the League of Conservation Voters. Several of those candidates, including Jared Polis in Colorado, won their races.\n\nIn Colorado, environmental advocates failed to pass a measure known as Proposition 112. The initiative would have required new wells to be at least 2,500 feet from occupied buildings and other \u201cvulnerable areas\u201d such as parks and irrigation canals \u2014 a distance several times that of existing regulations. It also allows local governments to require even larger setbacks.\n\nAs oil production has soared in Colorado in recent years and the population has grown, more and more residents are living near oil and gas facilities. Those who supported the ballot measure argued it was necessary to reduce potential health risks and the noise and other nuisances of living near drilling sites. Opponents countered that the proposal would virtually eliminate new oil and gas drilling on nonfederal land in the state \u2014 they have derided it as an \u201canti-fracking\u201d push \u2014 and claimed it would cost jobs and deprive local governments of tax revenue.\n\nThe industry-backed group, Protect Colorado, raised roughly $38 million this year as it opposed the controversial measure, which it says would \u201cwipe out thousands of jobs and devastate Colorado\u2019s economy for years to come.\u201d By contrast, the main group backing the proposal, known as Colorado Rising for Health and Safety, raised about $1 million.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate Colorado voters who realized what a devastating impact this measure would have had on our state\u2019s economy, school funding, public safety and other local services, \u201d Karen Crummy, spokeswoman for Protect Colorado, said in an email late Tuesday.\n\nSeparately, Chip Rimer, chairman of the board for the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, called Proposition 112 \u201can extreme proposal\u201d that would have devastated the state\u2019s economy. \u201cMoving forward we will continue working together with all stakeholders to develop solutions that ensure we can continue to deliver the energy we need, the economy we want and the environment we value,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nColoradans also rejected a separate but related measure Tuesday that would have amended the Colorado constitution to allow property owners to seek compensation if government actions devalue their property. The proposal has been sharply criticized by dozens of city councils and panned by Gov. John Hickenlooper (D), who called it \u201ca dangerous idea\u201d in which \u201cunscrupulous developers and speculators could make claims on local governments for literally anything they think has hurt the value of their land.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in Washington, the effort to put a price on carbon emissions appeared on the verge of defeat early Wednesday, with 56.3 percent of voters rejecting the measure and 43.7 percent supporting it with two-thirds of votes counted. An official at the Washington secretary of state\u2019s office said the vote-by-mail system in the state means it could take several days for a final vote tally.\n\nKnown as Initiative 1631, the measure would have made Washington the first state in the nation to tax carbon dioxide \u2014 an approach many scientists, environmental advocates and policymakers argue will be essential on a broad scale to nudge the world away from its reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nBut that proposal, like other environmental initiatives across the country, faced a bitter fight, pitting Big Oil refiners against a collection of advocates that includes unions, Native American groups, business leaders such as Bill Gates and former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, as well as the state\u2019s Democratic governor, Jay Inslee.\n\nIt also has set a state spending record along the way for a state ballot initiative. The group pressing for the carbon fee, known as the Clean Air, Clean Energy coalition, has raised more than $15 million. Meanwhile, oil companies belonging to the Western States Petroleum Association pumped more than $31 million into opposing the measure.\n\nThe initial $15-a-ton fee would have kicked in beginning in 2020, then increased $2 per ton (plus inflation) each year until 2035, when it would either freeze or rise, depending on whether the state had met its targets to slash greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nClimate campaigners did win at least one victory Tuesday in the Sunshine State. Florida voters, perhaps with the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill still fresh in mind, overwhelmingly decided to amend the state\u2019s constitution to ban offshore oil and gas drilling in state waters.\n\nBut even then, it was unclear whether offshore drilling alone motivated 69 percent of voters to support the measure. It was paired, oddly, with a proposal to prohibit indoor vaping.", "", "", "", "", "", "\n\nAn incredible Election Day sunset in D.C.

(Ricardo Moraes/AP)\n\nJair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s newly elected president, represents a leap of faith into the unknown for Brazil. With reactionary rhetoric and populist appeals against crime and corruption, Bolsonaro pitched himself to the Brazilian electorate as a drastic break from the past 16 years \u2014 and a move away from Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and the Workers\u2019 Party (PT).\n\nTo deliver on the mandate he has been handed, Bolsonaro will need to pass legislation, which will depend on forming coalitions in the National Congress. The judiciary and its role in prosecuting crimes will also be important \u2014 but the courts could get tough on the new president, too. The Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper exposed an illegal operation that systematically spread messages against Bolsonaro\u2019s opponent, the PT candidate Fernando Haddad; Bolsonaro\u2019s campaign is alleged to have been involved, and the judiciary and federal police are investigating. In short, conflict with other branches of government seems likely. And that is without even considering the future of the economy or support of the military, which looks set to be heavily involved in the administration.\n\n[In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s victory may mean further shifts in tolerance and moderation]\n\nThese tensions suggest Bolsonaro\u2019s tenure will be extremely unpredictable. What happens now? Here are three possible scenarios and what each might mean for Brazil:\n\n1. Disaster for Bolsonaro\n\nBolsonaro, who comes from outside Brazil\u2019s two main parties, the PT and the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), is in a fragile position. The legislature\u2019s fragmentation is at historic highs, with 30 parties elected to the Chamber of Deputies (for a whopping effective number of parties score of 16.4). Bolsonaro\u2019s Social Liberal Party (PSL) has the second-highest number of seats in the Chamber of Deputies but just 10 percent of the total representation. And the PSL is made up of political rookies, which could make it difficult for Bolsonaro to navigate the peculiarities of Congress. A similar situation ended up sinking Brazil\u2019s first president after re-democratization, Fernando Collor de Mello, on Sept. 29, 1992.\n\nBrazil\u2019s economy is also fragile. Unemployment only recently dipped below 12 percent \u2014 and the slide could mean the unemployed are giving up on finding work. Bolsonaro has signaled that he is willing to outsource his economic policy to Paulo Guedes, who has a doctorate from the University of Chicago and who may push free-market economic fixes, but will the new president \u2014 and Brazil \u2014 have the patience to fix the economy? Pensions urgently need reforms. And any global downturn or economic crisis would be a real concern, as Brazil would be vulnerable because it is a major exporter of commodities.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s combative style could lead to conflicts with both the Supreme Court and legislature. A significant percentage of his electoral base is loyal to him personally, but evangelical support could evaporate if social reforms fall short. Failing to improve security could also alienate law-and-order types, and his anti-PT strategic voters could jump ship at any time.\n\n[Brazilian voters wanted change \u2014 and they got it. Now what happens?]\n\nGiven the ambivalence of some of his supporters toward democracy and the presence of a retired general as his vice president, paralysis in the face of a political or economic crisis could bring a premature end to Bolsonaro\u2019s term. And if he picks too many fights, Congress could also act, making him the third impeachment victim since Brazil reestablished democracy in 1989.\n\n2. Success for Bolsonaro\n\nOr the opposite could happen, as Bolsonaro is coming from a position of strength. He won a decisive 10-point victory over Haddad in the second round of the election Oct. 28. The three largest states elected his allies as governors and the PSL emerged from obscurity to become the second-largest party in the Chamber of Deputies. Many of the other parties are not explicitly opposed to Bolsonaro and could be convinced to support his initiatives.\n\nBolsonaro could start off by throwing a bone to his evangelical and socially conservative base by offering socially oriented legislation. If he takes advantage of his honeymoon period to keep his big-business base happy, he could build up a head of steam that will be difficult to stop \u2014 particularly if the economy continues to improve.\n\nNeither Congress nor the judiciary are popular, so when the eventual conflict comes, Bolsonaro might be able to intimidate them into submission. His son, a federal deputy, even opined, famously, that it wouldn\u2019t take an army to close down the Supreme Court \u2014 just a private and a corporal would suffice.\n\nBolsonaro has already floated the idea of increasing the number of judges on the Supreme Court, adding his allies. His vice president floated the idea of a self-coup, or autogolpe \u2014 like Peru under Alberto Fujimori, closing Congress if it proved to be too much of an obstacle. If Bolsonaro approaches the 2022 election with a strong coalition, he could take Brazil ever closer to a delegative democracy \u2014 where Congress and the judiciary are largely sidelined.\n\n3. Partial reform and polarization\n\nDespite Bolsonaro\u2019s authoritarian style and anti-system discourse, he could be less combative than many observers fear. Like every other president since re-democratization, he could become co-opted by the system, distributing federal money and pork to pass laws through Congress but without being able to intimidate legislators with his support among the public and military. This would guarantee some legislative success but could eat away at his support.\n\n[Here\u2019s what you need to know about Dilma Rousseff\u2019s impeachment trial]\n\nIt could also be that Brazil steers clear of economic crisis but continues to see an underwhelming economic recovery. Long-term structural problems such as pension reform would probably go unaddressed. This scenario would see Bolsonaro lose part of his anti-PT support but keep his hardcore supporters on board. In this case, he very well could become a \u201cTrump of the tropics\u201d \u2014 largely ineffective, extremely polarizing and with an outside chance at reelection in 2022.\n\nWhat does this mean for Brazil?\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s first steps as president-elect seem to indicate that he might follow Path No. 3. He has named S\u00e9rgio Moro, the key figure behind the Operation Car Wash investigation to be his justice minister, which could either strengthen the investigation into government corruption or compromise it.\n\nEither outright failure or blinding success for Bolsonaro \u2014 Scenarios 1 or 2 \u2014 could spell disaster for the country as a whole, damaging democratic institutions and setting Brazil on a path from which it could take decades to recover.\n\nIn fact, the best outcome possible would probably be mediocrity. If Bolsonaro becomes an ineffective leader but can prevent outright chaos from taking hold, it would at least stave off the worst on both sides.\n\nRyan Lloyd is a postdoctoral fellow in political science and international relations at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo.", "", "Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tony Evers, left, and lieutenant governor candidate Mandela Barnes claim victory early Wednesday at the Orpheum Theater in Madison, Wis. Gov. Scott Walker narrowly lost his bid for a third term to Evers. (Mark Hoffman/Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel/AP)\n\nDemocrat Tony Evers proclaimed victory in the Wisconsin governor\u2019s race early Wednesday in the wake of returns so close that Republican Gov. Scott Walker did not concede, with his camp gearing up for what it called \u201ca long and drawn-out recount.\u201d\n\nWalker \u2014 a polarizing figure who already survived an acrimonious recall challenge in 2012 \u2014 was running for a rare third term against Evers, Wisconsin\u2019s schools superintendent, in a race that was tight throughout, polls showed.\n\nAfter a dramatic night of lead changes Tuesday, a sheaf of absentee ballots in Milwaukee finally appeared to put Evers over the top with 50 percent of the vote to Walker\u2019s 48 percent early Wednesday.\n\nAn ecstatic Evers, 67, appeared onstage at the Orpheum Theater in Madison with his lieutenant governor, Mandela Barnes, at about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday to proclaim himself the winner \u2014 as his supporters chanted his name.\n\n\u201cOh, my God!\u201d Evers said. \u201cGiven all the results we have seen tonight, I feel confident in saying to you right now: My name is Tony Evers and I\u2019m going to be the next governor of the state of Wisconsin!\u201d\n\nAbout an hour away in a suburban Milwaukee hotel ballroom, Walker\u2019s lieutenant governor, Rebecca Kleefisch, told a restive \u2014 and bewildered crowd \u2014 that \u201cthe fight is not over . . . . We are preparing for the likelihood of a recount here in the state of Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nIn his eight years as governor, Walker, 51, has rarely backed down from a fight. His decision early in his first tenure to eliminate most collective bargaining for public employees, known as Act 10, sparked days of protest at the capital and eventually a failed recall effort backed by big labor. Although Walker became a hero to conservatives, his presidential bid in 2015 failed early.\n\nIt was unclear early Wednesday if \u2014 or how \u2014 a recall process would actually take place. Evers seemed to have a comfortable margin of victory by the last unofficial tally of nearly 30,000. Ironically, Walker signed legislation last year that made it tougher to ask for a recount after Green Party candidate Jill Stein demanded a recount into President Trump\u2019s 2016 win in the state. Candidates can now request recounts only if they lose by one percentage point or less in an election with at least 4,000 votes total.\n\nPaul L. Decker, the Waukesha County board chairman, said that county clerks would have to review and certify the election results \u2014 a process known as \u201ccanvassing,\u201d that could take up to a week \u2014 before Walker\u2019s camp could request a recount.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, the Democratic Governors Association sent out a statement congratulating Evers on his \u201chuge win,\u201d which it said \u201csent a clear message that Wisconsin is ready for a governor who\u2019ll put schools, middle-class families and health care first.\u201d", "", "", "", "", "The deep divisions that have defined American politics in the era of President Trump played out across the country in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, as Democrats scored victories in key races in Republican-held suburban House districts but ran into a wall of opposition in red-state Senate contests.\n\nAll year long, Democrats talked optimistically about a blue wave that they believed was building around the country, one powerful enough to flip control of the House and even, against the odds, put the Senate in play as well. But a somewhat different reality began to set in early in the evening as the familiar contours of red and blue America powerfully reasserted themselves.\n\nA change in the balance of power in the House would represent a pulling back from the president by key parts of the electorate, particularly by female voters. That alone could have a significant effect on the second half of Trump\u2019s first term, particularly in Washington.\n\nBut the overall voting patterns in House, Senate and gubernatorial contests signaled that the differences and divisions that have defined the country during Trump\u2019s presidency remain and seemingly are growing stronger. That sets the stage for a contentious and competitive presidential election two years from now, with the stakes now higher than ever.\n\nTrump quickly claimed credit for the Republican successes in key Senate races, after campaigning almost nonstop over the last weeks of the midterms, focusing heavily on states where he had done best in his 2016 victory.\n\nBy elevating the issue of immigration with warnings, without evidence, of a coming invasion of undocumented immigrants, Trump again put the Democrats on the defensive and found a way to protect the GOP\u2019s narrow majority in the Senate. But those same tactics may have contributed to the success of Democrats in some of the most contested House races.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump, at a rally in Cape Girardeau, Mo., on Monday, found a way to help maintain the GOP\u2019s majority in the U.S. Senate. (Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nSome House races, including those in California where Democrats hoped to pick up seats, remained to be counted, and Democrats fell short in some districts they had hoped to win. But overall, they did what they set out to do, which was to find a way to put a check on the president and a Republican Party that had held all the levers of power in Washington since 2016.\n\nFor Democrats, the elation they felt over the prospect of capturing the majority in the House was tempered by what happened to their candidates in some of the highest profile statewide races.\n\nIn Florida, Democrat Andrew Gillum, whose progressive agenda had excited many in the Democratic base, fell narrowly to Republican Ron DeSantis, who as much as any candidate in the country had wrapped himself in the mantle of Trump.\n\nIn Texas, Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who attracted a national following among Democrats and raised tens of millions of dollars from all over the country, lost to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nIn Georgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams, bidding to become the first African American woman to lead a state, was trailing Republican Brian Kemp in a race that had turned ugly toward the close.\n\nDemocrats suffered a double disappointment in two key presidential battlegrounds, losing governor's races in both in Florida and Ohio, where Republican Mike DeWine defeated Democrat Richard Cordray.\n\nThose losses were a reminder to Democrats that the electoral map remains challenging even if they hold an advantage in the overall popular vote in the country.\n\nThose issues await an election two years away, but what happened Tuesday will be very much on the minds of the president\u2019s strategists and those who will be working for the many Democrats now thinking of seeking their party\u2019s nomination. They all will have to contend with what Tuesday\u2019s voting said about the country as a whole.\n\nThis was an election that once again saw men and women moving in different directions. In key suburban districts, Democratic challengers were counting on the support of women, particularly women with college degrees, to push them over the top. But there were signs that white men, especially those without college degrees, who have become the backbone of the Trump coalition, also were coming out in significant numbers.\n\nA Washington Post-Schar School poll found that women in battleground House districts were 12 points more supportive of Democratic candidates than Republican candidates, and white women with college degrees backed Democratic candidates more than 20 percentage points more than they backed Republican candidates. White men with college degrees, by way of contrast, supported Republican candidates by 12 points.\n\nRepublicans had suffered from an intensity gap earlier in this election cycle, but a combination of factors helped to narrow the Democrats\u2019 advantage. In part, the normal patterns of partisans coming home as Election Day neared took hold. But the confirmation battle over Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, which turned into a bitter fight, helped to energize the GOP coalition as well. Added to that was Trump\u2019s relentless campaigning.\n\nThe Post-Schar School survey underscored the degree to which these midterm elections, perhaps more than any in the recent past, had raised the emotional level of the population. Nearly four in 10 voters (35 percent) in battleground districts said one principal word they would use to describe their feelings about this election was \u201cangry.\u201d Another 37 percent called themselves \u201canxious.\u201d\n\nPerhaps reflecting the exhaustion of a time in which everything seems hyperpartisan and supercharged, 42 percent said they were hopeful about what the election results would bring. Network exit polls, meanwhile, found that nearly eight in 10 Americans said they believed the country was more divided than ever.\n\nWith Democrats gaining control of the House, both Democratic congressional leaders and the president will face some difficult choices in the months ahead. The president will have to decide whether to try to work with Democrats. Congressional Democrats will have to make a similar calculation.\n\nDemocrats have pledged to move forward on an agenda that includes political change, health care and infrastructure. They and Trump could find agreement on infrastructure and possibly on drug prices. The two sides also will have to reach agreement on a budget and an extension of the debt ceiling. The new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico will consume time during the first half of 2019, too.\n\nBut the bigger question that will define the coming year or more is what Democrats decide to do about investigating the president and his administration. Looming over that is the pending report from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who is leading the investigation into Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 election and possible collusion with people associated with the Trump campaign.\n\nWhat the Democrats do on the question of investigation will shape the relationship, such as it is, between Democrats in Congress and the president. What isn\u2019t likely to change is how the country as a whole views those battles.\n\nThe House takeover represents a significant change in the status quo in Washington. But it might end up doing little to affect the overall shape of an America deeply divided over the leadership of the president.", "", "", "", "", "", "In Arizona, voters said no to accelerating the shift to renewable energy. In Colorado, they said no to an effort to sharply limit drilling on nonfederal land. And a measure to make Washington the first state to tax carbon emissions appears to have fallen short.\n\nThe failure of environmental ballot measures in Arizona and Colorado \u2014 and the likely defeat of a proposal to impose fees on carbon emissions in Washington state \u2014 underscore the difficulty of tackling a global problem such as climate change at the state and local level, where huge sums of money poured in on both sides.\n\nEven as a U.N.-backed panel of scientists recently warned that the world has barely a decade to radically cut its emissions of greenhouse gases that fuel global warming, the Trump administration has been busy expanding oil and gas drilling and rolling back Obama-era efforts to mitigate climate change. Environmental advocates and Democratic lawmakers have placed much hope in state and local governments to counter those policies.\n\nBut while Tuesday saw the election of numerous candidates dedicated to climate action, individual ballot measures aimed at the same goal largely foundered.\n\n\u201cWhat we learned from this election, in states like Colorado, Arizona, and Washington, is that voters reject policies that would make energy more expensive and less reliable,\u201d said Thomas Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, an industry-backed free-market advocacy group.\n\nRichard Newell, president of the nonpartisan think tank Resources for the Future, drew a different conclusion.\n\n\u201cThe complexities and politics of the clean energy transition are best navigated through a legislative process, which has been the basis for virtually all significant state level climate and renewable energy policy,\u201d Newell said in an email. \u201cI would not take this as a repudiation of public desire to address climate change, including through carbon pricing or clean energy standards, but rather that the details and who is engaged in the policy formulation matter, a lot. That\u2019s tough to do through a ballot initiative.\u201d\n\nEven in the solidly blue state of Washington, initial results looked grim for perhaps the most consequential climate-related ballot measure in the country this fall: a statewide initiative that would have imposed a first-in-the-nation fee on emissions of carbon dioxide, the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases that drive global warming. While voters in King County, home to Seattle, turned out heavily in favor of the measure, residents across the rest of the state largely opposed it.\n\nOne bright spot for environmental advocates came in Nevada, where voters appeared poised to pass a measure similar to the one Arizonans rejected. It would require utilities to generate 50 percent of their electricity from renewables by 2030. The proposal was leading handily with most votes tallied Wednesday. But before the measure could become law, it has to survive a second vote in 2020.\n\nSince President Trump took office, a handful of states \u2014 notably California \u2014 have vowed to serve as a counterweight on energy and environmental policy to a president who frequently dismisses the government\u2019s own findings that human activity is warming the globe. In September, California codified into law a commitment to produce 100 percent of its electricity from carbon-free courses by 2045.\n\nBut Tuesday\u2019s ballot question results demonstrate the limits to which other states are willing to follow California\u2019s lead \u2014 particularly when campaigners against the proposals emphasize the potential impact on pocketbooks.\n\nSupporters and proponents poured an eye-popping amount of money, more than $54 million, into the fight over the future of energy in Arizona. Only two Senate races in the country \u2014 in Florida and Texas \u2014 saw more spending this year.\n\nThe influx of cash underscores how much both sides believed was at stake. The ballot initiative would have amended the Arizona constitution to require electric utilities to use renewable energy for 50 percent of its power generation by 2035. That might seem easily within reach in sunny Arizona. But the state now gets only about 6 percent of its energy from the sun.\n\nThe state\u2019s biggest utility, Arizona Public Service, or APS, emerged as the most fervent opponent of the proposal, pouring more than $30 million into a political action committee called Arizonans for Affordable Electricity. In an aggressive ad campaign, the group argued that the measure would cost households an additional $1,000 a year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve said throughout this campaign there is a better way to create a clean-energy future for Arizona that is also affordable and reliable,\u201d APS chief executive Don Brandt said in a statement Tuesday evening.\n\nMeanwhile, an alliance of dozens of organizations called Clean Energy for a Healthy Arizona argued that the shift toward cleaner energy will improve public health and create good jobs in the state. The group got a huge assist from California billionaire investor and political activist Tom Steyer, who donated the lion\u2019s share of the nearly $23.6 million raised through the end of September.\n\nTwenty-nine states and the District already have programs known as Renewable Portfolio Standards, or RPS, that require utilities to ensure a certain amount of the electricity they sell comes from renewable resources. But only a fraction of those have targets as ambitious as the ones proposed this year in Arizona and Nevada. For instance, New York and New Jersey also have targets of 50 percent renewable energy by 2030. Hawaii would require 100 percent of its energy to be from renewable sources by 2045.\n\nDuring the 2018 campaign, however, 11 Democratic candidates for governor vowed to try to get all of their respective states\u2019 electricity from \u201cclean\u201d energy sources by the middle of the century, according to surveys done by the state affiliates of the League of Conservation Voters. Several of those candidates, including Jared Polis in Colorado, won their races.\n\nIn Colorado, environmental advocates failed to pass a measure known as Proposition 112. The initiative would have required new wells to be at least 2,500 feet from occupied buildings and other \u201cvulnerable areas\u201d such as parks and irrigation canals \u2014 a distance several times that of existing regulations. It also allows local governments to require even larger setbacks.\n\nAs oil production has soared in Colorado in recent years and the population has grown, more and more residents are living near oil and gas facilities. Those who supported the ballot measure argued it was necessary to reduce potential health risks and the noise and other nuisances of living near drilling sites. Opponents countered that the proposal would virtually eliminate new oil and gas drilling on nonfederal land in the state \u2014 they have derided it as an \u201canti-fracking\u201d push \u2014 and claimed it would cost jobs and deprive local governments of tax revenue.\n\nThe industry-backed group, Protect Colorado, raised roughly $38 million this year as it opposed the controversial measure, which it says would \u201cwipe out thousands of jobs and devastate Colorado\u2019s economy for years to come.\u201d By contrast, the main group backing the proposal, known as Colorado Rising for Health and Safety, raised about $1 million.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate Colorado voters who realized what a devastating impact this measure would have had on our state\u2019s economy, school funding, public safety and other local services, \u201d Karen Crummy, spokeswoman for Protect Colorado, said in an email late Tuesday.\n\nSeparately, Chip Rimer, chairman of the board for the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, called Proposition 112 \u201can extreme proposal\u201d that would have devastated the state\u2019s economy. \u201cMoving forward we will continue working together with all stakeholders to develop solutions that ensure we can continue to deliver the energy we need, the economy we want and the environment we value,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nColoradans also rejected a separate but related measure Tuesday that would have amended the Colorado constitution to allow property owners to seek compensation if government actions devalue their property. The proposal has been sharply criticized by dozens of city councils and panned by Gov. John Hickenlooper (D), who called it \u201ca dangerous idea\u201d in which \u201cunscrupulous developers and speculators could make claims on local governments for literally anything they think has hurt the value of their land.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in Washington, the effort to put a price on carbon emissions appeared on the verge of defeat early Wednesday, with 56.3 percent of voters rejecting the measure and 43.7 percent supporting it with two-thirds of votes counted. An official at the Washington secretary of state\u2019s office said the vote-by-mail system in the state means it could take several days for a final vote tally.\n\nKnown as Initiative 1631, the measure would have made Washington the first state in the nation to tax carbon dioxide \u2014 an approach many scientists, environmental advocates and policymakers argue will be essential on a broad scale to nudge the world away from its reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nBut that proposal, like other environmental initiatives across the country, faced a bitter fight, pitting Big Oil refiners against a collection of advocates that includes unions, Native American groups, business leaders such as Bill Gates and former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, as well as the state\u2019s Democratic governor, Jay Inslee.\n\nIt also has set a state spending record along the way for a state ballot initiative. The group pressing for the carbon fee, known as the Clean Air, Clean Energy coalition, has raised more than $15 million. Meanwhile, oil companies belonging to the Western States Petroleum Association pumped more than $31 million into opposing the measure.\n\nThe initial $15-a-ton fee would have kicked in beginning in 2020, then increased $2 per ton (plus inflation) each year until 2035, when it would either freeze or rise, depending on whether the state had met its targets to slash greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nClimate campaigners did win at least one victory Tuesday in the Sunshine State. Florida voters, perhaps with the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill still fresh in mind, overwhelmingly decided to amend the state\u2019s constitution to ban offshore oil and gas drilling in state waters.\n\nBut even then, it was unclear whether offshore drilling alone motivated 69 percent of voters to support the measure. It was paired, oddly, with a proposal to prohibit indoor vaping.", "", "More than 100 women were projected to win seats in the House of Representatives, easily shattering the record.

Republicans knocked off several Senate Democratic incumbents, increasing their majority there. Already both sides are claiming victory.\n\nDemocrats are on pace to pick up more than 30 House seats across the country, including some unexpected wins. They\u2019ll argue that shows their message resonated in Trump territory. Republicans will point to triumphs in high-profile statewide races as an endorsement of President Trump and his agenda.\n\n[Winners and Losers from Election 2018]\n\nSo, should winning the House with a substantial number of pickups, while losing ground in the Senate fit the criteria for a \u201cblue wave\u201d? Here\u2019s the case for and against calling these midterms a wave election.\n\nYes, it was totally a blue wave\n\nIn previous midterm elections, when the House changed parties by smaller margins nationwide than it did this year, they were given the designation of being a \u201cwave.\u201d\n\nAs of early Wednesday, Democrats were projected to win the national popular vote by nearly nine percentage points, which is greater than the Republican \u201cwaves\u201d in 1994, 2010 and 2014 and the Democratic \u201cwave\u201d in 2006. If those elections were waves, then this one is, too.\n\nThe economy is strong, unemployment is at historic lows and yet, Democrats can argue, they were still able to take the House away from the party of the sitting president.\n\nDemocrats did particularly well in the suburbs, where they hoped to capitalize on anti-Trump sentiment, especially among suburban women. They unseated Reps. Barbara Comstock (Va.), Mike Coffman (Colo.), Carlos Curbelo (Fla.) and Kevin Yoder (Kan.), as well as Pete Sessions (Tex.), who serves as Rules Committee chairman and has been in Congress for 15 years.\n\nThey even scored a few notable upsets, such as Democrat Max Rose taking out Rep. Daniel Donovan (R-N.Y.) in a Staten Island-based district the GOP wasn\u2019t supposed to lose.\n\nMinority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who is hoping to hold the speaker\u2019s gavel once again, said triumphantly in her victory speech that because Democrats took the House, \u201ctomorrow will be a new day in America.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats also picked up five gubernatorial seats in New Mexico, Kansas, Illinois, Michigan and Maine. Laura Kelly, for one, overtook Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, an ally of Trump with a similarly hard-line approach to immigration.\n\nThen, in what may be considered Democrats' greatest victory of the night, they ousted Wisconsin governor and onetime presidential candidate Scott Walker.\n\nThe statewide wins in Wisconsin and Michigan are especially noteworthy given that they are considered among the states that Hillary Clinton thought she had locked down and ultimately cost her the 2016 presidential election.\n\nOne could also argue it\u2019s a blue wave based on how historic some of the Democrats\u2019 wins were. There will be a record number of women in Congress next year. The House could have close to 100 women, most of them Democrats who decided to run for public office in response to Trump\u2019s election. The new Democratic caucus will include the first Native American women, the first Muslim women and the youngest woman, who is also Latina, ever elected to Congress.\n\nAs for the Senate, few predicted the Democrats would actually win it. But did you see how close Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke got to beating Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas? Texas!\n\nThe Senate map was against Democrats from the start \u2014 a lot of their incumbents were up for reelection in conservative states that went for Trump in 2016. If Democrats had retained their Senate seats in Indiana, North Dakota and Missouri, that wouldn\u2019t have been a wave, it would have been a tsunami.\n\nNo way, you can\u2019t call that a wave\n\nSure, the Democrats took the House, but did you see just how badly they got trounced in the Senate? Sens. Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) and Claire McCaskill (Mo.) all lost by sizable margins, allowing the Republicans to widen their majority.\n\nTremendous success tonight. Thank you to all! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2018\n\nTrump tweeted that the night was a \u201ctremendous success.\u201d And from his vantage point, it was.\n\nThe massive repudiation of Trump that Democrats hoped for simply didn\u2019t happen. In fact, in many states where Trump campaigned hard for Republicans, it seems the opposite occurred. He focused throughout the campaign on saving the Senate for the GOP, and it appears his efforts paid off.\n\nAnd while House Democrats can now go forward with impeachment if they like, Trump is buffered by a Republican Senate that would never convict him.\n\nNotably, the Democratic candidates who received the most national attention and fanfare lost or are on track to lose. In Georgia, even appearances by Oprah Winfrey and former president Barack Obama don\u2019t seem to have gotten gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams across the finish line. And O\u2019Rourke, who reached almost rock-star status (Beyonc\u00e9 posed on Instagram Tuesday wearing a Beto hat!), couldn\u2019t overtake Cruz in the end.\n\nDemocrats also weren\u2019t able to pull off as many upsets in the House as they would have liked. There were several seats that were slightly out of reach, but they had hoped that a big enough wave could capture them.\n\nThis election also leaves Democrats with an identity crisis. Since 2016, one of the narratives from the liberal wing of the party has been that Democrats were losing key races because they lacked big, bold ideas.\n\nYet, some of their highest-profile liberal candidates lost, including Kara Eastman (Neb.), Randy Bryce (Wis.) and Liz Watson (Ind.), making it all the more challenging for Democrats to decide what kind of party they\u2019re going to have heading into the 2020 presidential campaign \u2014 which unofficially starts now.", "", "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Kim Yong Chol, a North Korean senior ruling party official and former intelligence chief, arrive for a lunch at the Park Hwa Guest House in Pyongyang on July 7.

It added that Kim Yong Chol apparently had canceled his New York flight early Tuesday.\n\nOne person familiar with the situation said Kim Yong Chol may have wanted to parlay his meeting with Pompeo into a visit with Trump, but canceled the visit after being told Trump would be flying to Paris on Friday and unavailable for a meeting.\n\n[North Korea threatens to restart nuclear program unless U.S. lifts sanctions]\n\nThe postponement comes at a tricky time in the nuclear negotiations.\n\nNorth Korea wants both sides to take \u201csimultaneous and phased\u201d steps, with its concessions matched by similar steps from Washington, to reassure the North Korean leader he can safely scale back or dismantle his nuclear weapons program.\n\nThe United States takes a fundamentally different approach, demanding North Korea fully denuclearize before sanctions are lifted.\n\nIn the past few weeks, the two sides appear to have grown further apart. North Korea has increased its demands: It had been asking the United States to formally declare an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but now it is arguing it needs sanctions relief before it takes any further steps.\n\nOn Friday, a commentary published by the head of a North Korean Foreign Ministry think tank warned Pyongyang might even restart its nuclear weapons program if sanctions are not lifted.\n\n\u201cWe are at a crossroads. Someone needs to blink. If no one does, we could be back to fire and fury days all over again,\u201d said Harry Kazianis, an Asia expert at the Center for the National Interest.\n\nAt the same time, South Korean government advisers and experts say Pyongyang is not prepared to hand over a list of its nuclear and missile facilities, believing such a document would effectively give the U.S. military a list of potential targets.\n\nIf these disputes are behind the postponement of the meeting, it would not be the first time the negotiations have run into trouble.\n\nIn May, Trump announced a planned summit with Kim Jong Un had been canceled, citing hostile statements from Pyongyang.\n\nBut soon afterward, as a result of mediation by South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Kim Yong Chol flew to the United States to meet Pompeo and deliver a letter to Trump that paved the way for the June summit.\n\nIn August, a planned trip by Pompeo to Pyongyang was canceled when negotiations hit an impasse. The secretary of state eventually made the trip last month.\n\nKim Eui-keum, a spokesman for South Korea\u2019s presidential Blue House, advised against reading too much into the latest setback.\n\n\u201cThis has happened in the past, so we don\u2019t need to overemphasize this,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI also don\u2019t think this means U.S.-North Korea talks, both at the high level and summit level, have lost their momentum.\u201d\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry also told reporters not to \u201coverthink\u201d the postponement or \u201cfixate on every turn.\u201d But it acknowledged disappointment and said it hopes the talks will be rescheduled soon.\n\n\u201cOur government had hoped for a real advancement in denuclearization and the establishment of permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula through the North Korea-U.

But some argue the U.S. foreign policy establishment is locked into a too-rigid mind-set.\n\nJoel Wit, a former State Department official with extensive experience in negotiating with the North Koreans, said Washington is sticking to the \u201cold playbook,\u201d one that has failed repeatedly, particularly in its insistence that North Korea first take steps such as denuclearization before the United States does anything.\n\nWit, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington, has become much more pessimistic in recent weeks. \u201cI think the U.S. is going to miss this opportunity, essentially because there is no one below Trump who is capable of thinking out of the box,\u201d he wrote in an email earlier this week.\n\nHudson reported from Washington.

At this writing, Democrats are projected to win the popular vote in House races by 9.2 percent. This is a significantly larger share than the Republicans won in their own recent blowouts. Republicans got 7.1 percent in 1994, 7.2 percent in 2010 and 5.7 percent in 2014.\n\nThis landslide for the opposition party is a repudiation of President Trump. Only House races reflected the opinion of the entire country. And flipping the House will alter the balance of power in important ways. Not only will Democrats be able to hold Trump accountable and launch investigations into administration abuses. They will also have a major impact on the budget. They will be able to defend the Affordable Care Act. And they will begin the task of laying out a longer-term alternative to Trumpism.\n\nYes, Republicans did well in the Senate races. But the fight for the Senate was waged almost entirely on the GOP\u2019s playing field. The Democrats\u2019 losses came largely in places Trump carried by large margins \u2014 Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota. But Democratic senators prevailed in the industrial states that were key to Trump\u2019s electoral college victor: Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Sen. Joe Manchin held onto West Virginia, while the outcomes in Florida and Montana currently remain uncertain.\n\nTrump will claim the GOP\u2019s gains in the Senate as a great victory, and the outcome is certainly disappointing to Democrats. But notice the pattern: Except in Florida if Sen. Bill Nelson is indeed defeated, Republican triumphs were in GOP base states. Losing the swing states is the more important sign for the future. Trumpism\u2019s hold on discounted blue-collar and middle-class voters has been substantially weakened.\n\nElections, like Scripture, can be interpreted in many ways. Their outcomes are relatively easy to spin, especially given Tuesday\u2019s split House/Senate decision. But there can be no spinning the huge swing of ballots to the Democrats in the House contests, the end of unified Republican government, or the fact that Donald Trump\u2019s influence is now confined to Republican bastions.\n\nRead more from E.J.

(Carlos Osorio/Reuters)\n\nMarijuana advocates scored a number of substantial ballot victories in the middle of the country on Election Day, chief among them the legalization of recreational marijuana in Michigan, which becomes the 10th state in the nation to approve recreational use of the drug.\n\n\u201cMichigan will be the first state in the Midwest to end marijuana prohibition and replace it with a system in which marijuana is regulated for adult use,\u201d Marijuana Policy Project deputy director Matthew Schweich, who directed the legalization campaign, said in a statement. \u201cAdults will no longer be punished for consuming a substance less harmful than alcohol, and rather than having to resort to the illegal market, they will be able to access it safely and legally from licensed businesses.\u201d\n\nThe results in Michigan follow the opening of recreational marijuana markets in Canada and the repeal of marijuana prohibition in Mexico. With the addition of Michigan, nearly 80 million Americans \u2014 25 percent of the total U.S. population \u2014 live in a state or jurisdiction that has legalized recreational marijuana. The most recent polling by Gallup shows that two-thirds of American adults support legalization of the drug.\n\nIn deep-red North Dakota, on the other hand, voters overwhelmingly rejected an unusual bill that would have legalized marijuana without setting any possession limits or regulatory structure. The outcome in North Dakota underscores Republican skepticism of legalization \u2014 in the Gallup survey just 53 percent of Republicans nationwide said they supported marijuana legalization, compared to 71 percent of independent voters and 75 percent of Democrats.\n\n\u201cTonight, parents can sleep easy knowing their children won\u2019t wake up to more marijuana use in their schools,\u201d said Luke Niforatos, senior policy adviser to Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a group that opposes legalization. \u201cThe sensible, wonderful people of North Dakota have rejected marijuana commercialization in their state.\u201d\n\nElsewhere on the ballot tonight, voters in Missouri approved one out of three medical marijuana measures up for consideration, avoiding a potentially messy fight over which measure would go into law if more than one passed. Missouri\u2019s Amendment 2 allows doctors to recommend marijuana for a number of medical conditions. Patients would be able to obtain the drug either through a dispensary or by growing it at home.\n\nAs of this writing, a medical marijuana measure in Utah is leading 53-47 with 76 percent of precincts reporting. That comes after supporters and opponents of the bill struck a deal with Utah\u2019s governor to call a special section of the legislature to write a compromise bill regardless of whether the measure passed. Supporters of the bill agreed to the compromise because lawmakers in Utah are able to overturn ballot propositions with a simple majority vote.", "", "Columnist\n\nThe aftershock from Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat has been two years in coming, but on Tuesday night it arrived, as legions of women were elected to Congress and statehouses across the country.\n\nOne after another, they won across the map.\n\nDemocrat Laura Kelly was elected governor of ruby-red Kansas.

The face of resistance in the Trump era has truly been a female one, starting with the massive protest marches they staged the day after President Trump\u2019s inauguration, in cities and towns throughout the nation. They are giving more to candidates than ever before. And the #MeToo movement has added another impetus.\n\nThis has been largely a Democratic phenomenon. In fact, there are likely to be fewer Republican women in the House next January than there are now. But the GOP\u2019s female candidates also made history in some places on Tuesday. Among them was Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who was the first woman from Tennessee ever to be elected to the Senate.\n\nA Washington Post-Schar School poll of battleground district voters showed women also took different priorities into the voting booth on Tuesday. By 14 percentage points, they were more likely than men to name health care as one of the top two issues in determining their votes. The economy, meanwhile, was a less important factor to women: Only 30 percent named it as one of their top two priorities, while 40 percent of men did.\n\nIt will be days before we get a broad sense of what happened in state legislative races, but it appears certain that women will have make significant gains there as well.\n\nAccording to a tally by Rutgers University\u2019s Center for American Women and Politics, 3,379 women were running Tuesday for seats in legislatures across the country, up more than 25 percent from two years ago. In 35 states, there were record numbers of female Democrats in contention; in 10 states, unprecedented tallies of Republican women.\n\nAll of this new female representation on the state level will have long-run implications. More women will be part of the deal-cutting that happens when legislatures draw the maps for once-a-decade redistricting. Given the importance that women voters have placed on health care, they will, no doubt, add to the pressure in some states to do things such as expanding their Medicaid programs.\n\nThere have been other election seasons that have been declared \u201cthe year of the woman.\u201d This time, though, women have left an imprint on politics that feels like it will last \u2014 no longer a novelty, but a norm.", "Want smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

But a number of quiet developments over the past few days suggest that there are major problems in the diplomatic process. Indeed, the United States and North Korea may have grown further apart since Trump\u2019s historic summit with Kim Jong Un on June 12.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo was scheduled to meet North Korea\u2019s nuclear negotiator, Kim Yong Chol, in New York on Thursday. According to the State Department, Pompeo and his North Korean counterpart were to \u201cdiscuss making progress on all four pillars of the Singapore Summit joint statement, including achieving the final, fully verified denuclearization of [North Korea].\"\n\nPompeo said he expected to make \u201csome real progress\u201d at the meeting, which would be used to plan for a second Trump-Kim summit tentatively scheduled for early next year. \u201cI\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll advance the ball again this week when I\u2019m in New York City,\u201d he told CBS News' Face the Nation.\n\nInstead, just minutes after midnight on Wednesday, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert announced that the Thursday meeting would not take place. \u201cWe will reconvene when our respective schedules permit,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was yet another sign of how diplomacy has stagnated in the months since the summit. Pompeo has traveled to North Korea and held high-level meetings with his counterparts, much like the one coming up in New York. But at the working level, where the details are actually hammered out, progress has been slow at best.\n\nThe Trump administration had hoped to move things along by appointing a dedicated special envoy, Stephen Biegun, to lead negotiations. But Biegun has not yet been able to secure a meeting with North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui, who is supposed to be leading North Korea\u2019s working-level delegation.\n\nMany U.S. observers had chided the Trump administration for starting with high-level talks rather than with working-level meetings. Now, it seems that North Korea is the one dragging its feet on the more detailed negotiations. \u201cMy own concern is the leaders are so way out in front,\u201d Joseph Yun, a former U.S. envoy on North Korea policy, said at a forum in Seoul last month.\n\nThe source predicts upcoming talks between the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and ex-spymaster Kim Yong Chol will not be successful, unless the US shows new willingness to ease sanctions before complete denuclearization. \u2014 Will Ripley (@willripleyCNN) November 6, 2018\n\nThe issues with this approach were reinforced last Friday, when North Korean state media suggested that the \u201carrogant\u201d behavior of the United States could lead Pyongyang to restart its \u201cbyungjin\u201d policy \u2014 simultaneously focusing on economic development and its nuclear program. It was effectively a warning that North Korea could soon resume the weapons and missile tests that led to so much tension in 2017.\n\nRobert Carlin, a former CIA analyst and State Department specialist on Korea, wrote that the commentary was a new level of warning from North Korea. It \u201cgoes to the heart of Pyongyang\u2019s concern that the US has been moving backwards, away from the agenda the two leaders laid out in the Singapore Summit joint statement,\u201d Carlin wrote in a post for the North Korea-focused website 38 North.\n\nThe latest warning followed a number of other jibes from North Korean state media, including one that took the unprecedented step of criticizing Trump by name. As NK News noted, it was the \u201cfirst negative casting of the American president on U.S.-DPRK diplomacy since the Singapore summit took place,\u201d suggesting that even the high-level goodwill between Trump and Kim could be falling short.\n\nFor Trump, the breakdown in North Korean diplomacy would be a personal failure. The U.S. leader long suggested that he could solve the North Korea problem if he met with Kim himself \u2014 and he had a point. His willingness to meet the North Korean leader face-to-face this year set things in motion in a way previous U.S.-North Korea meetings, which involved officials at a lower levels, did not.\n\nBut as the Singapore summit recedes further into the past, its flaws are becoming more apparent. The brief, vague statement that Trump and Kim signed \u2014 just 400 words \u2014 did not provide a clear path for resolving the key issues in the standoff between the United States and North Korea. Both sides are still arguing over what \u201cdenuclearization\u201d means and when it will happen, just as they were before the summit.\n\n\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo before their meeting in Pyongyang on Oct. 7. (AP/AP)\n\nThe U.S. president, always an unpredictable speaker, is also reported to have raised North Korean hopes about declaring an official end to the Korean War. That would grant Pyongyang some legitimacy, but many in Washington oppose such a move because of its implications for the U.S. military presence in South Korea. A Korean Peninsula formally at peace might be one on which U.S. troops would no longer be welcome.\n\nFor Pyongyang, the most important issue right now appears to be sanctions relief. But that is fundamentally at odds with the U.S. position, which says that Washington cannot ease economic pressure on North Korea because it would lose its greatest leverage over Pyongyang. Just this weekend, Pompeo emphasized that the United States would not lift sanctions until it could verify that North Korea had given up its weapons. North Korea, though, is hoping for sanctions first to be lifted.\n\nThe larger problem is that both sides are divided not only over what happens next, but also what has happened so far. The Trump administration viewed the Singapore Summit as a triumph of its \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d sanctions policy and portrayed North Korean denuclearization as a fait accompli. But North Korea believes it forced Trump into a meeting with the success of its ramped-up nuclear capabilities, an advantage it is unlikely to give up.\n\nCan such different views of negotiations be reconciled? Perhaps, especially given Trump\u2019s own personal investment in talks. With the political test of the midterms over, Trump is likely to turn toward foreign policy again \u2014 and any big moves will ultimately come down to his choices.\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know? Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.", "As he flew aboard Air Force One to an airport hangar rally in Mosinee, Wis., President Trump groused to aides about having to tone down his prepared remarks.\n\nPipe bombs had been mailed to several of his favorite foils, including to the homes of two former presidents and the New York offices of CNN. It was a moment for presidential leadership, less than two weeks before the midterm elections that would deliver a verdict on his first two years in office.\n\nBut, according to two aides familiar with Trump\u2019s objections, the words set to be loaded into the teleprompter didn\u2019t match the president\u2019s own plans for closing the campaign, the details of which he had kept from other Republican leaders. He wanted controversy, fury and fear that would push limits and get ratings, paint a caravan of Central American migrants as a mortal threat and color Democrats as their co-conspirators.\n\nNow speechwriters were telling the man who encouraged fistfights at his 2016 campaign rallies to call for \u201call sides to come together in peace and harmony.\u201d They wanted the real estate promoter who dubbed his Democratic opponent \u201ccrooked\u201d to demand an end to \u201ctreating political opponents as being morally defective.\u201d\n\nThe midterm elections were always going to come down to a moment like this: President Trump, isolated and imperious, deciding the fate of his Republican Party\u2019s electoral hopes.\n\nIn three short years, he had become an omnipotent force in American life, overturning the customs of the White House, the values of the Republican Party and the rules of public debate. His opponents had reacted fiercely, with the largest street protests since the 1960s and the greatest wave of political engagement \u2014 as measured by money and volunteer energy \u2014 that had ever been seen in an off-year election.\n\n\n\nDan Sena, executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, realized soon after Trump took office in 2017 that Democrats would have to break from the party\u2019s instincts. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Cal)\n\nThey were united, as rarely before, against him. But that was just how he liked it, always at the center of attention, going with his gut, selling his defiance as a foundational attribute. He believed in the reactions of his own enormous crowds. They would allow him to defy the prognosticators and polls, show up his media critics, and once again rewrite the rules of American politics.\n\nAt the White House, a number of senior aides had argued privately that Trump\u2019s focus on fanning fears over immigration went too far. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) would call Trump twice in the final weeks to urge him to get off the nonstop immigration talk and refocus on the economy.\n\nHe argued that Trump should focus on how voters outside the boisterous rallies reacted. Avoid distractions and needless fights, Ryan\u2019s team argued with White House colleagues. Frame the election as a choice between Republican accomplishment and Democratic rhetoric.\n\n[Conservatives wonder if Trump might leave them in the cold]\n\nTrump would sound like he agreed on the phone, and then veer quickly back to what interested him, while complaining to his own advisers that Ryan, who was leaving office, had allowed too many of his members to retire.\n\nNow as Air Force One crossed over Lake Michigan, Trump would once again listen only to himself. He agreed to read the words about unity without abandoning his own strategy of division. To explain the contradiction, he just added a wink and a nod.\n\n\u201cDo you see how nice I\u2019m behaving today? Have you ever seen this?\u201d Trump told the crowd, going off script, in a sarcastic aside after calling for harmony. \u201cWe\u2019re all behaving very well.\u201d\n\nThe crowd burst into laughter, providing a nice segue to tease his plans. \u201cWait until you see what we\u2019re doing with our border over the next two weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cOur country is assaulted by thousands and thousands of people marching,\u201d he said of a group of migrants more than 1,000 miles away.\n\nWhat followed were days of shocks to the political system. The mail-bombing suspect was a Trump booster who had attended his rallies and, authorities said, internalized his name-calling. Three other men suspected of racist, anti-Semitic, misogynist or anti-immigrant delusions allegedly would shoot and kill 15 people in three states over 10 days, at a supermarket, a synagogue and a yoga studio.\n\nBut Trump stayed the course, consistently raising the temperature of the public debate. He would not make phone calls to the pipe-bomb targets, including former president Barack Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. He complained about the distraction of domestic terrorism hurting Republicans. \u201cFor seven days nobody talked about elections,\u201d he told a crowd in Columbia, Mo., on Nov. 1.\n\nInstead, he rolled out his own news events, without coordinating them with Ryan or the leadership of the National Republican Congressional Committee: new troop deployments to the border, a profane campaign ad that falsely accused Democrats of letting a Mexican cop killer into the country, the threat of answering rock throwers at the border with gunfire by U.S. soldiers, even the claim of a treasonous \u201cDemocrat-led assault on our sovereignty.\u201d Sometimes, he did not coordinate his announcements with his own aides.\n\nWhen the president threatened to undo birthright citizenship with an executive order, Ryan spoke out to defend the Constitution as written, prompting Trump to publicly attack his governing partner. The two men talked by phone later that day. The conversation was short, said three people familiar with the call, and Trump made clear he thought that immigration was still a better message than the economy.\n\nIt was pure Trump, and it cleared the way for a blow to the president\u2019s governing coalition as Republicans lost the House while keeping firm control of the Senate. Republican losses in the House on Tuesday ran directly through the suburban districts that were most concerned about the president\u2019s divisive behavior, with many races being decided by the thinnest of margins.\n\nIt was just the latest step in a political realignment \u2014 a repolarization of politics \u2014 that began in 2015 with Trump\u2019s announcement that he would run for president as a Republican.\n\nThis account of the battle for power on Capitol Hill is based on more than four dozen interviews with campaign strategists, White House advisers, party officials, government advisers and elected leaders, on both sides of the aisle. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nThey told the story of a Republican Party battered, emboldened and increasingly redefined. Trump also helped Democrats find a new voice, with a new generation of leaders emerging and a new playbook for winning.\n\nTrump's 'snow globe'\n\nThe election season began for Dan Sena, the executive director of the Democratic House effort, at a Cracker Barrel in Pennsylvania, where he went to watch diners stream Trump\u2019s 2017 inauguration on their phones. \u201cThere was a woman who was sitting there,\u201d he remembered, \u201cand she says to her daughter, \u2018We\u2019re recording this at home. He\u2019s our president.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn a blink, Sena saw the challenge. Midterm elections tended to be referendums on the sitting president. Whole parts of the nation, particularly women in well-heeled suburbs, were rejecting Trump. But Sena knew that was not enough, given the way districts were drawn.\n\nTo win the speaker\u2019s gavel, Democrats would have to compete for voters who had already forgiven Trump his rule-breaking and liked his policy pitch amid a rising economy. The party would have to break from its instincts, lay off Trump and resist moving left on policy. Sena found himself describing Trump to other Democrats as a godlike figure. Trump held the nation\u2019s attention in his hands, able to unleash chaos whenever he wanted.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t control what happens when Donald Trump goes like this to the snow globe,\u201d he would say, shaking his hands as if holding one. \u201cWe knew that to pick up seats in this cycle, we needed a strategy that allowed us to put as many boats into the water, not necessarily waiting on a wave or banking on a wave, but just as many chess pieces on the board as you possibly can.\u201d\n\nThe first step was to come up with a message. A poll by the Democrats\u2019 House Majority PAC in the summer of 2017 raised alarms: Congressional Republicans scored far higher with working-class whites on issues Democrats believed they should own, such as reducing the power of special interests, rewarding hard work, fighting for people \u201clike you.\u201d Less than 1 in 4 said Democrats in Congress helped to improve the economy and create jobs, compared with 41 percent who credited Republicans.\n\n\u201cThey were certain that Washington was wholly corrupt, and they were the inevitable losers in that equation,\u201d said Jill Normington, the pollster. As the discussions continued, voters kept coming back to the same question: \u201cIs there going to be more money in my pocket or less money in my pocket?\u201d\n\n[Voters are angry and divided, but still believe in the power of the vote]\n\nPollsters soon returned with a way for Democrats to claw out of their abyss \u2014 a broad message focused on fighting GOP plans to raise health-insurance premiums, remove protections for preexisting conditions and cater to special interests.\n\n\u201cWe sort of combined taxes and health care \u2014 the idea that Republicans were going to cut taxes on insurance companies and they were going to raise premiums on people didn\u2019t sit well with people,\u201d said Matt Canter of Global Strategy Group, who led focus groups as part of the effort.\n\nBy the summer of 2018, Democrats had a pocketbook plan that minimized issues like immigration and went after Trump in only a handful of districts where he was deeply unpopular. It was a sharp departure from the Republican strategy in 2010 and 2014 to campaign more directly against Obama.\n\nBut first Democrats had to find new faces to sell their new message, a task that suddenly appeared far easier than anyone had expected. They were people like Dan McCready, a Marine veteran who had led troops in Iraq before graduating from Harvard Business School. He began talking to an old classmate, Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), in the weeks after Trump won.\n\n\u201cWe spent hours on the phone,\u201d said Moulton. \u201cAt one point he told me, \u2018Seth, I\u2019m 99 percent certain. I just need to know I can be as good a dad as a member of Congress.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMoulton told McCready, who would trail in early results in North Carolina\u2019s 9th District, that the commute to Washington would not make him a better father. \u201cBut you weren\u2019t when you were a Marine, either,\u201d Moulton added. \u201cYou were serving the country.\u201d\n\nBefore long, there were about 20 military-veteran candidates for Congress, including Jason Crow in Colorado, who began trading campaign tips on a private Slack channel organized by Moulton. None identified as liberal crusaders, and most voiced skepticism of the current Democratic leadership.\n\nThey were joined by a swell of hundreds of female candidates, many of them encouraged by the activist groups that had sprung up in defiance of Trump and in sync with the women in suburban districts who would prove the biggest target of the midterm elections. The rush of new talent with scant political records and more-moderate views was a nightmare for Republicans.\n\nMany cut biographical videos for YouTube, filled with military hardware and straight talk, that brought in millions from around the country. M.J. Hegar, a long-shot Democratic candidate in Texas, raised $750,000 in 10 days after posting a three-minute video that went viral.\n\nOver the course of the campaign, as the popularity of Trump and Democrats rose and fell, the polling for first-time candidates in the tightest races would hold steady, a sign that they had defined themselves as distinct from the poisonous national conversation that had convulsed the party in earlier campaigns.\n\nRepublicans had always wanted to run against Nancy Pelosi-style liberals, like they had in the first special election after Trump\u2019s win, when Democrat Jon Ossoff had been defeated in Georgia after his supporters were mocked as old San Francisco hippies. But Democrats had learned from that race, and would not make the same mistake.\n\n\u201cIf you get to be seen as a nonpartisan parent of three cute little kids, and before you go to Washington to save the world, you blew up terrorists in the Middle East, you are going to win,\u201d griped one Republican election strategist.\n\nPelosi made clear there were no consequences for denouncing her. \u201cJust win, baby,\u201d became her mantra. Candidates like Kansas Democrat Paul Davis, one of the first to publicly oppose Pelosi, were quietly invited to Washington to receive strategy advice and a pep talk from Pelosi.\n\n[Winners and losers from election night 2018]\n\n\u201cShe allowed a large swath of candidates to run against the party without consequence and present themselves as genuine political outsiders,\u201d said Andy Surabian, a former White House political adviser who worked for Donald Trump Jr. later in the cycle.\n\nRepublicans also saw their dream of a socialist rebellion in the Democratic Party fail to materialize. Nominees like New York\u2019s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made for early targets but quickly became team players. Only one liberal candidate, Kara Eastman in Omaha, won a primary that Democratic strategists believed undermined their chances of winning the seat.\n\nIn the U.S. Capitol, meanwhile, Democrats moved quickly to diminish the calls for impeachment in their rank and file, and coached candidates away from talking about massive new government programs favored by the Democratic base.\n\n\u201cStick with lower health-care costs, bigger paychecks and cleaner government,\u201d Pelosi would say, publicly and privately. \u201cThe health-care issue is dominant \u2014 it\u2019s dominant.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, she would speak with more-colorful language about Trump. \u201cYou can\u2019t get in a tinkle contest with a skunk,\u201d she told colleagues. \u201cYou just can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMembers were won over. \u201cThe message \u2018Contain Trump\u2019 is a stronger political message than \u2018Impeach Trump,\u2019 \u201d said Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), who was one of the first to introduce articles of impeachment for Trump, before deciding he did not want the House to vote on them.\n\nBefore a Pennsylvania special election in March, the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC affiliated with Ryan that would spend $107 million on House broadcast ads, sent a researcher to Pittsburgh for three weeks to find dirt on Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, a Marine veteran who had also served as a federal prosecutor. The effort turned up nothing, a fact that CLF\u2019s executive director, Corry Bliss, would later explain to a group of Republicans, including Ryan.\n\n\u201cSo you are saying he is a good person?\u201d asked Ryan.\n\n\u201cYeah, it sucks,\u201d Bliss responded.\n\nThe lost ones\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, were having less luck in the candidate department. Early in 2018, Republican strategists convened a focus group to screen a positive ad about Rick Saccone, Lamb\u2019s opponent. Several women in the group reacted with laughter. When asked why, they pointed to the candidate\u2019s close-cropped mustache.\n\nLamb, who was 26 years younger, looked like a clean-\n\nshaven action hero, and he beat Saccone in March by 627 votes, or 0.2 percent, in a district Trump had carried by nearly 20 percentage points.\n\nEven before that defeat, the sense of looming disaster had been spreading through the party. Between 1930 and 2016, there had never been more than 27 Republicans retiring from the House in a single election cycle, according to the Brookings Institution. On Tuesday\u2019s ballots, 41 Republican-held districts, including Ryan\u2019s, lacked an incumbent on the ballot, either because of retirement or resignation. Of that group, at least 15 were vulnerable to Democratic takeover, more than half the number Democrats needed to take the majority.\n\nTens of millions of dollars had to be set aside to defend these seats, and in several cases there was little hope. \u201cIf we had half as many [seats to defend], we would keep the House,\u201d predicted one Republican strategist of the retirements.\n\nInside the caucus, years of dysfunction had taken a toll. Leaders had little sway with members, and former committee chairmen had little incentive to stick around. At the White House, political advisers were taken aback as the names started dribbling out. \u201cThere was no strategy to keep people around,\u201d said one person involved in the effort.\n\nMore often than not, party leaders found that out someone was heading out the door only after the decision had been made. Over at the NRCC\u2019s office, staffers could be heard screaming when news broke on Twitter of another key lawmaker throwing in the towel.\n\nOther members debating retirement found themselves captive to the new wave of anti-Trump activism sweeping the country, with protesters camped outside their offices.\n\nIn early 2017, Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), the NRCC chairman, responded with an all-hands-on-deck effort to stop Republicans from even holding town halls, lest embarrassing video result. Those who insisted on meetings were instructed to follow clear rules: Enter and exit the event separately from voters, bring security, make sure the participants were constituents and try to get questions submitted in advance.\n\nIn New Jersey\u2019s 11th District, Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen had been expected to continue his family\u2019s Republican dynasty of elected leadership that dated to his state\u2019s founding. Since 1994, he had never won his Democratic-leaning district by less than 58 percent of the vote, but now the resistance was camped outside his office, with a surprisingly sophisticated operation.\n\n\u201cWe had a full-on research team. We had a data analysis team that was looking at the entire area,\u201d said Sally Avelenda, the executive director of NJ11th for Change. \u201cWe showed up at every farmers market, every town event that wouldn\u2019t shut us out.\u201d\n\nFrelinghuysen complained about Avelenda\u2019s political work to a board member of her employer, Lakeland Bank. She says a supervisor later warned her that the congressman was a \u201cfriend of the bank,\u201d prompting her to quit her job and go public with the story, which the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee cut into a digital ad. Frelinghuysen called it quits less than a year later, allowing Democrats to pick up the seat with Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy pilot and federal prosecutor who became an early favorite.\n\nOut in California, the weekly rallies against Rep. Darrell Issa (R) grew over the course of 2017 into a sort of street carnival, with a sound system manned by a former musician for Sha Na Na and a retirement cake baked into the shape of a Hawaiian shirt.\n\nEllen Montanari, a corporate consultant who had seen Trump\u2019s election as a catastrophe, made sure everyone stayed on message. When one speaker took the microphone to thank Democrats, Montanari grabbed it away, and quickly thanked independents and Republicans as well. \u201cI said to her, \u2018Don\u2019t ever do that again,\u2019 \u201d Montanari remembered.\n\nIssa tried to engage, speaking several times at the rallies against him. But in the end his heart was not in it. He decided over Christmas without telling party leaders, paving the way for a likely Democratic pickup. \u201cIt was really a growing frustration with how the House was operating and the absence of an ability to get things done,\u201d said Dale Neugebauer, Issa\u2019s former chief of staff.\n\nWell-oiled machine\n\nWith the deck stacked against them, Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) decided their best option was to try to get both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue on the same page. At a Camp David retreat in early January, McCarthy stood before the president to perform his best imitation of a TED Talk, with a slide show of animated charts and graphs.\n\nMcCarthy explained that the president\u2019s party typically lost more seats in midterm elections than Republicans could afford if they wanted to stay in power. But there were two recent exceptions \u2014 in 2002 after the attacks of 9/11 and in 1998 after the impeachment of Bill Clinton, when Republicans also overreached by shutting down the government.\n\nThat second example, McCarthy argued, could provide a model, especially since Democrats were headed toward a shutdown over Trump\u2019s decision to end legal protections for migrants who had been brought to the country as children.\n\nThe key, McCarthy said, would be to minimize losses with \u00adcollege-educated women in the suburbs and keep the partisan advantage of Democratic House candidates at less than six points, according to a person familiar with the briefing.\n\nHe recommended focusing on legislative efforts to curb the \u00adopioid epidemic and limit human trafficking, along with an aggressive plan to sell the tax cut \u2014 issues meant to project a sympathetic face to voters outside Trump\u2019s base. Notably, the presentation did not focus on immigration, the topic Trump would choose to obsess over in the fall.\n\nBut for Trump, whose entire brand was anchored in disruption, sticking to a plan based on soothing suburban women was a challenge. At an April tax cut roundtable in West Virginia, he announced that his prepared remarks were \u201ca little boring\u201d and threw the paper into the air.\n\nWhat followed was a rambling preview of the closing message. He decried birthright citizenship and claimed, without any evidence, that a group of asylum seekers then walking through Mexico included women who had been \u201craped at levels that nobody has ever seen before.\u201d\n\nGOP strategists watched Trump nervously as the generic ballot polls fluctuated like a stock market ticker, rising and falling with national events and the president\u2019s actions. The failure to repeal Obamacare and the struggles over tax law discouraged Republicans, just as the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh encouraged them. Trump\u2019s reaction to the 2017 white-nationalist protests in Charlottesville, the Parkland shooting and the bungled Helsinki summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin all inflated Democratic energy.\n\nHouse Republican leaders wanted Trump to talk about economic issues. Trump wanted to talk immigration. The president became upset when his campaign produced an ad that focused on economic gains through the eyes of a mother hoping her daughter would succeed, surprising his own political advisers.\n\nHe repeatedly said that his voters wouldn\u2019t come to the polls for the economy, advisers said, and that they did not like Congress. So he ordered the ad to be replaced with a spot focused on the dangers of immigration.\n\n\u201cHe thinks what is good for the base is good for everybody,\u201d said one senior Republican official, who noted that issues like crime and national security did not play the same in all competitive districts. \u201cYou just work around him.\u201d\n\nAt the White House complex, Trump\u2019s political team had examined every House and Senate district to see where he could have the most impact. In an office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, the wall was plastered with details of his 2016 performance.\n\nThe aides concluded that there was little he could do for some in the House, but substantial sway that he could bring to Senate races by reminding Republicans in rural states why they voted for him. The message matched Trump\u2019s own desire, never changing, to be out there on the trail, dominating cable television news.\n\nThe decision only magnified divisions in the party that Stivers, the NRCC chair, had long struggled to navigate. In early November 2017, weeks after former White House aide Stephen K. Bannon had appeared on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d to declare that Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) opposed Trump\u2019s \u201cpopulist economic agenda,\u201d Stivers met with Bannon at his home base on Capitol Hill. The hope was to form a truce within the party, but the immediate effect was the opposite.\n\nJosh Holmes, an adviser to McConnell, was enraged. \u201cFellas \u2014 this is genuinely hard to believe,\u201d he wrote in an email to Ryan\u2019s staff. Neither House nor Senate leaders had been given advance warning about the meeting.\n\nLate in the cycle, as suspected hate crimes came to dominate the news, Stivers became defensive. He had been criticized for a Sunday show appearance in which he defended Republican ads that called out George Soros, the Jewish financier who was often the target of anti-Semitic propaganda.\n\nAfter a story broke about Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) traveling to Austria to meet with representatives of a party with neo-Nazi roots, Stivers announced on Twitter that he \u201cstrongly condemned\u201d King\u2019s behavior \u2014 without first consulting other Republican leaders. He had a debate scheduled back in his own district that night.\n\n\u201cIt is the NRCC\u2019s job to win races, not to be the morality police,\u201d said one former NRCC aide. \u201cOnce you start commenting on one thing, you have to comment on everything.\u201d\n\nPressure built throughout the House caucus. Many realized they would have to fend for themselves, without any cover from the president or the national party.\n\n\u201cBirthright citizenship is protected by the Constitution, so no @realDonaldTrump you can\u2019t end it by executive order,\u201d Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) tweeted after Trump floated the idea.\n\nIn Colorado, Rep. Mike Coffman (R) would take an even harder public line, announcing that Trump\u2019s \u201cattempt to demonize\u201d migrants as criminals \u201cis simply wrong.\u201d\n\nCoffman was a classic victim of all that had changed about his party \u2014 the polarization that pulled the suburbs away from Republicans, the rush of anti-Trump enthusiasm among Democrats and the sometimes crossed signals among Republicans desperate to hold the House.\n\nHe also was a symbol of those crossed signals: On the same day in September that the Congressional Leadership Fund announced that it was pulling $1 million in television advertising out of Coffman\u2019s district, the NRCC\u2019s independent expenditure arm announced a $600,000 investment, only to pull out of the race weeks later.\n\nThe green wave\n\nCandidates like Coffman, a moderate critic of Trump who had long outperformed his party in the Denver suburbs, had another problem: the flood of Democratic spending. In past races, Coffman had invested heavily in digital and cable, where Democrats did not compete, but now even these platforms were filled with ads for his opponent, Jason Crow, a former Army infantry captain who had served three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nCoffman\u2019s campaign staff would gather around the computer every week when ad buys were announced to find out if they would be outspent by 4-fold or, once, even 13-fold on broadcast television.\n\nAt one point, 16 Democratic groups were attacking him, compared with just three Republican defenders for the cycle. The Democratic plan to expand the map had taken its toll, and Republican strategists in Washington told Coffman\u2019s team that they had to cut bait.\n\n\u201cThe general answer was, \u2018Look, the map is so freaking big,\u2019 \u201d said Tyler Sandberg, a consultant for Coffman. \u201cIt was just an onslaught.\u201d After winning by eight points in 2016, Coffman was headed for a loss by about the same margin on Tuesday.\n\nFor Republicans, the money flood felt ubiquitous. Through the beginning of November, Democratic candidates were outspending Republican candidates on broadcast advertising by $173 million to $93 million.\n\nThe conservative billionaires were chipping in, but they could not compete with ActBlue, the liberal donation-processing company that made it in\u00adcred\u00adibly simple to convert anger at Trump or the GOP into a $5, $10 or $50 donation on the phone.\n\nThe platform raised $1.5 billion for liberal candidates and causes during the cycle, nearly twice as much as during the 2016 presidential campaign. Of the 4.7 million small-dollar donors, 63 percent were giving for the first time. Money given directly to candidates could be used to purchase airtime, under the law, at far cheaper rates than paid by outside groups who collected bigger checks.\n\nDemocratic super PACS, meanwhile, had found new ways of coordinating their efforts. Priorities USA, a group that backed Clinton in 2016, devoted itself to digital advertising, creating a dashboard so that all the liberal efforts could coordinate their purchases on Hulu, YouTube, Facebook and other platforms.\n\nHouse Majority PAC, which coordinated more than $200 million in spending, created a separate clearinghouse that combined polling, online interviews and spending to provide predictions for key House races. The group also expanded the online testing of ads, after being surprised by how many spots actually had a negative effect on the goal.\n\n\u201cOne-third of the ads we tested actually caused backlash,\u201d said Jesse Stinebring, a data scientist at Civis Analytics, who worked on the project. Clients were encouraged to test small ad runs before any major buys.\n\nBy summer, Republicans began to worry that the party was losing the definition battle. Brian Baker, a political strategist for billionaire donors Todd Ricketts and Sheldon Adelson, tested more than a dozen ads to try to paint Democrats as extreme. One focus group began on the day Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) encouraged supporters to harass Republicans in restaurants and department stores.\n\n\u201cEven the Democratic focus groups were turned off,\u201d Baker said. His groups would put $15 million behind a national advertising effort that promoted GOP accomplishments and painted Democrats as a screaming, violent mob of socialists and anarchists who would burn the flag, raise taxes, open the borders and impeach the president.\n\nBut even this effort was swamped in the final weeks by a billionaire with murkier partisan leanings. After splitting his donations between parties in 2016, Michael Bloomberg would invest more than $115 million of his own money in the Democratic cause, most of it in the final weeks, including about $44 million into the House campaigns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a backbreaker in a lot of races,\u201d said a second senior Republican official.\n\nWithout any donors to answer to, Bloomberg went into the most expensive suburban media markets, in New York, Los Angeles and Miami. He also had money to experiment. Howard Wolfson, a former Democratic House strategist who ran the Bloomberg effort, ranked all the districts by educational attainment, in a search for highly educated districts that might have flown under the radar.\n\nHe then polled for opportunity, eventually deciding to pump nearly $1 million into the suburban Atlanta district of Rep. Rob Woodall (R), who had already been outraised by more than $1 million by his Democratic opponent. Even though he had won by nearly 21 percentage points in 2016, Republicans were forced to scramble for cash to bail him out, only to find donors and strategists resistant, furious that the candidate had done so little to prepare.\n\nWoodall, who spent most of the cycle in what Republicans considered a safe seat, held on to a narrow lead with 99 percent of precincts reporting.\n\nTrump will be Trump\n\nAs a candidate in 2016, Trump always believed that his opponents underestimated the power of grabbing people\u2019s attention. By the time he got to Pensacola, Fla., three days before the elections, he felt he needed to educate his critics.\n\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he talk about the economy? Why does he talk about immigration and what\u2019s coming up with the caravan?\u201d he asked the crowd rhetorically. \u201cWe can talk about the economy, but the fact is we know how well we\u2019re doing with the economy and we have to solve problems.\u201d\n\nHis advisers kept trying, anyway. Some continued to tell Trump that he faced both a base motivation problem and a suburban women problem. He only seemed fixated on the former. Even his strategy to bring female aides on stage was less calculated strategy, White House aides said, and more that they were standing beside him before he went out and he thought the crowds would love them.\n\nIn what seemed intended as a hint, the chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, told ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday that the president was focused on the economy; only the media, she said, focused on immigration. On Monday, the White House placed an opinion piece on Fox News\u2019s website, under the president\u2019s own byline, that contradicted Trump\u2019s points on the stump. \u201cVote Republican and continue the jobs boom,\u201d the headline said.\n\nIt was a hallmark of Trump\u2019s politics. There was no shame in contradiction, misinformation or vilification. When several companies, including Fox News and Facebook, refused to run a version of his closing campaign ad demonizing immigrants as murderers, he responded breezily to a reporter. \u201cA lot of things are offensive,\u201d he said. \u201cYour questions are offensive.\u201d\n\nWhat he was after was attention. \u201cYou know the midterm elections used to be, like, boring, didn\u2019t they?\u201d he said at a Monday rally in Cleveland. \u201cNow it\u2019s like the hottest thing.\u201d\n\nAt the White House, aides had already begun to lower expectations for the House. Trump\u2019s efforts to awaken the Republican base had been effective in rural areas and in states where Senate Democrats were struggling to stay in office, they argued. There was just no more talk of the red wave Trump had once promised. The final average of public polls showed Democrats had a 10-point advantage, far higher than the six-point benchmark set by McCarthy at Camp David.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s own approval rating had ticked up from its lows, and he appeared to have energized his own voters down the stretch. His fingerprints were all over the Senate contests, where Republicans gained ground in conservative states like North Dakota, Missouri and Indiana, while beating back a moderate Democratic challenge in Tennessee.\n\n\u201cThese are NOT \u2018red states\u2019 or \u2018Republican states\u2019 \u2014 they are \u2018Trump states,\u2019 \u201d White House political director Bill Stepien wrote in an internal memo that was leaked before Halloween.\n\nIt was enough for Trump to declare victory, in a tweet that betrayed no misgivings.\n\n\u201cTremendous success tonight,\u201d he tweeted as the results came in, ignoring his defeats in the House. \u201cThank you to all!\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump readies for 2020 campaign with no plans to change his approach\n\nRepublicans retain control of Senate with candidates who embraced Trump\n\nA split America reasserts its divisions in the midterm elections\n\nMike DeBonis and Robert Costa contributed to this report.", "Rep. Steve King, the embattled eight-term Republican congressman who has declared his support for ethnic nationalism and made a series of other racially incendiary comments, survived a challenge from a first-time Democratic candidate, J.D. Scholten, preserving the GOP\u2019s control of Iowa\u2019s 4th Congressional District.\n\nThe district, which lies in the northwest quadrant of the state, was long considered safe Republican territory. King barely campaigned, recycling an ad from an old campaign and refusing to debate his opponent.\n\nBut the nonpartisan Cook Political Report last week moved the race from \u201clikely\u201d to \u201clean\u201d Republican, as King, 69, became engulfed in controversy in the aftermath of the massacre of 11 congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue.\n\nAt a town hall last week, King erupted when an attendee asked him whether his hard-line views on race and identity bore resemblance to those of the Robert Bowers, the man accused of the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in the nation\u2019s history.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican said Monday that he hoped Supreme Court Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor \u201cwill elope to Cuba,\u201d hours before he was to appear with Iowa\u2019s governor in an election-eve rally.\n\nSome of his Republican colleagues have criticized King\u2019s rhetoric, and the House Republican campaign arm said it wouldn\u2019t \u201cplay\u201d in his race as several major corporations cut off financial support.\n\nBut King\u2019s once-fringe views have moved further into the mainstream under the Trump presidency, and he retained support from party bigwigs, such as Sen. Charles E. Grassley, also of Iowa.\n\nKing has long made controversial statements, comparing immigrants to dogs and saying young migrants had \u201ccalves the size of cantaloupes\u201d because they were transporting heavy loads of marijuana. In 2015, he tweeted a cartoon depicting then-President Barack Obama wearing a turban.\n\nHis party didn\u2019t rebuke him in June when he retweeted a message from a self-described \u201cNazi sympathizer.\u201d Last month, he voiced support for Faith Goldy, an unsuccessful Toronto mayoral candidate who has promoted the false notion that a \u201cwhite genocide\u201d is underway. And last week, reports surfaced that King had met in August with members of an Austrian political party founded by former Nazis, during a trip funded by a group that promotes awareness of the Holocaust.\n\nThe congressman dismissed such criticism as \u201cfake news.\u201d The Des Moines Register reported Tuesday that it had been barred from King\u2019s election night event.\n\nKing\u2019s Democratic challenger walked a fine line between capitalizing on the modest backlash against King and alienating voters in the deep-red district, where voters in 2016 favored Trump to Hillary Clinton roughly 2-to-1.\n\nScholten, 38, is a former minor league pitcher and paralegal. He ran as an outsider and a populist. He landed the endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), as well as that of the Sioux City Journal, which has favored King in the past.\n\n\u201cThe average person in Congress is 58 years old, with a net worth of $1 million,\u201d Scholten said in an ad from earlier this year. \u201cWell, I\u2019m different.

Not anymore,\u201d she said as the crowd\u2019s cheers grew louder.\n\nSen.

Trump won Missouri by nearly 20 percentage points in the 2016 presidential elections. He campaigned here twice in the past week for Hawley, who has aligned himself squarely with Trump and lavishly praised the president.\n\nHawley, who was a toddler when McCaskill became a politician in 1982, will be the country\u2019s youngest U.S. senator at 39.\n\nMcCaskill first entered politics as a state legislator. She was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006, before Missouri became a deep-red state. The political veteran who\u2019s credited for her savviness and plain-spokenness was reelected in 2012, after she helped boost Todd Akin, whom she viewed as the weaker opponent, in the GOP primary. Akin helped hand McCaskill a victory after he said that \u201clegitimate rape\u201d rarely caused pregnancy.\n\nShe spoke only for a few minutes as family members surrounded her onstage. Many supporters cheered; others cried.\n\nHarper Lane, 20, said she was optimistic that McCaskill would win. Before Hawley was declared the winner, the political science major at Washington University in St. Louis sat on the floor, her hands crossed in front of her face, as she watched the election results on a giant screen.\n\n\u201cAfter canvassing all around St. Louis, I had really high hopes for Claire. I talked to people who said they wanted Claire to be their senator,\u201d said Lane, a field intern who had knocked on about 3,000 doors since August. \u201cIt\u2019s really confusing and, obviously, very disappointing.\u201d", "", "", "", "The 2018 election is nearly in the books: Democrats have taken the House, and Republicans will keep the Senate. And there was, and will be, plenty of shouting.\n\nBelow, some winners and losers.\n\nWinners\n\nDemocrats\n\nRepublicans will pitch this as a split decision, because they gain seats in the Senate. It\u2019s not; the Senate map was highly favorable to them, meaning that maintaining control of it was expected. Democrats just took over a chamber of Congress, and that\u2019s a big thing for them, period.\n\nTheir math when it comes to winning the Senate in coming elections got tougher, but they now have a seat at the table in Washington.\n\nSpeaker(?) Nancy Pelosi\n\nGood things (probably) come to those who wait. It\u2019s rare that a former speaker sticks around for as long as Pelosi did after losing the gavel in 2010. And it seemed especially odd that she did, given how tough we knew it would be for Democrats to win back the House this decade.\n\nBut she kept raising big money for her side, and she stuck around long enough. Now she just needs to make sure there are enough Democrats willing to vote for her to allow her to become speaker again. It will be tough to stop her, though.\n\nMitch McConnell\n\nIt may not have been a huge surprise that Republicans held the Senate, but they did it with ease, meaning Republicans can keep confirming President Trump\u2019s judges. And it will be even easier now, given the GOP\u2019s majority has expanded by at least a couple seats.\n\nOh, and the bonus for the Senate majority leader: Democrat Amy McGrath\u2019s loss in Kentucky\u2019s 6th District. The highly touted candidate and top fundraiser would instantly have been considered a potential candidate for McConnell\u2019s seat in 2020.\n\nFlorida\u2019s felons\n\nAmendment 4 passed in Florida, restoring voting rights for convicted felons. That\u2019s both huge from a civil rights standpoint \u2014 especially given that such ballot initiatives in Florida need to clear a 60 percent threshold \u2014 and from an electoral one. About 9 percent of the voting-age population in Florida is composed of felons, and many of them are racial minorities. That could change elections (probably in Democrats\u2019 favor) for years to come.\n\nDemocratic diversity\n\nColorado\u2019s Jared Polis became the first openly gay man elected governor, and Democrats elected two Muslim women (Michigan\u2019s Rashida Tlaib and Minnesota\u2019s Ilhan Omar) and two Native American women (Kansas\u2019s Sharice Davids and New Mexico\u2019s Deb Haaland), among other firsts. They also may set the record for women elected.\n\nJohn James\n\nThe Republican Senate candidate from Michigan got little buzz and lost, but he was actually closer to unseating Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) than the GOP was to holding the state\u2019s governor\u2019s seat. As of early Wednesday morning, he was losing by just seven percentage points.\n\nJames, an African American Iraq veteran and conservative businessman, didn\u2019t get much national backing this time. He might in a future run.\n\nMedicaid expansion\n\nBallot initiatives passed in three deep-red states \u2014 Nebraska, Idaho and Utah \u2014 to expand Medicaid eligibility under Obamacare, and a fourth state \u2014 Kansas \u2014 elected a Democratic governor who replaces a Republican who previously nixed an expansion that was supported by the Republican-controlled state legislature.\n\nThat\u2019s four states set to join the 33 that have already expanded Medicaid.\n\nSherrod Brown 2020\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) pretty easily dispatched Rep. James B. Renacci (R-Ohio), despite the GOP winning Ohio\u2019s governor\u2019s race. Then, in his victory speech, Brown left little doubt he\u2019s eyeing the next prize: a presidential run.\n\n\u201cLet our country \u2014 our nation\u2019s citizens, our Democratic Party, my fellow elected officials all over the country \u2014 let them all cast their eyes toward the heartland, to the industrial Midwest, to our Great Lakes state,\u201d Brown said. He concluded: \u201cThat is the message coming out of Ohio in 2018, and that is the blueprint for our nation in 2020.\u201d He\u2019s running?\n\nBeto 2020 (and beyond)\n\nNo, things didn\u2019t go according to plan for Texas Democrats\u2019 new supposed savior. They haven\u2019t won a statewide race in 24 years \u2014 the longest such streak in the country \u2014 and that didn\u2019t change Tuesday.\n\nBut Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Tex.) did raise a metric ton of money, and even a close loss (he trailed by just three percentage points with 94 percent of precincts in) is likely to keep him on the radar. Given the very long list of Democrats expected to run for president, why not the guy who just made Texas competitive? He\u2019s got to be tempted.\n\nLosers\n\nBeto 2018, and its donors\n\nA loss is a loss, and we shouldn\u2019t pretend it\u2019s not. It\u2019s got to be especially deflating for those who invested so much hope in O\u2019Rourke\u2019s candidacy \u2014 and for the people who invested their hard-earned cash, a record $70 million worth of it. Democrats have a way of focusing on shiny objects, and this shiny object didn\u2019t prevail Tuesday.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the economy, stupid\u2019\n\nThe Trump era has forced us to reevaluate many political assumptions, and we can now add this Clinton-era adage to the list. The idea that the economy is the most important thing at all times doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense when the unemployment rate is 3.7 percent and 8 in 10 voters rate the economy positively, but the party in power loses a chamber.\n\nThe economy almost certainly helped Republicans, but it wasn\u2019t enough to save them, either because of external factors or because Trump was so focused on other things.\n\nTrump\u2019s immigration strategy\n\nIt was fashionable to say that Trump\u2019s fear-based, anti-caravan strategy was ugly, but probably effective. And it might have been in Senate races in clearly red territory. But it didn\u2019t seem to do much of anything to save the House, which was the more endangered chamber. Exit polls showed about half of voters regarded Trump\u2019s rhetoric as \u201ctoo tough.\u201d\n\nIn the end, it seemed more that Trump was just doing what he knew, rather than what would save one-half of Congress.\n\nVoting against Kavanaugh\n\nOne vote can be oversold, but it\u2019s notable that Sens. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) cast some of the most surprising votes against Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court nomination \u2014 after voting for Neil M. Gorsuch \u2014 while Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) voted for Kavanaugh and did just fine in the Trumpiest state in the country.\n\nAgain, that vote may not have sealed the deal, but Donnelly and Heitkamp both underperformed expectations \u2014 and Donnelly badly so. Perhaps those votes reminded conservatives of the big downside of having a Democrat in the Senate.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 next generation of stars\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just O\u2019Rourke losing a high-profile, tough race. Andrew Gillum lost for Florida governor. Stacey Abrams appeared likely to lose in Georgia\u2019s governor\u2019s race and fail to make the runoff (though there is some question). And Randy Bryce, the man Democrats fell in love with as a foil to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (you know: Iron Stache), lost the open-seat race for Ryan\u2019s seat by double digits.\n\nThese might have been the four buzziest Democratic candidates \u2014 in fact, they were the four cited by Esquire \u2014 and they all came up short.\n\nDanny Tarkanian\n\nThe son of famed UNLV basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian has tried his best to make a name for himself \u2014 and failed ... six times in 14 years. From a state Senate campaign to a secretary of state bid to a Senate bid to three congressional races, Tarkanian has looked hard for a winnable race and came up empty each and every time.

It\u2019s an emphatic rejection of Trump and of his placid Republican enablers in the House. House Republicans\u2019 only real \u201cachievement\u201d \u2014 a tax cut that voters dislike \u2014 did not save them.\n\nTrump insisted he wanted the midterm elections to be all about him. And they were. Exit polls showed almost two-thirds of voters considered their ballot at least in part a referendum on Trump; a plurality (38 percent) said their vote for the House was a vote against Trump while 54 percent disapproved of his job performance and as many said the country is on the wrong track. A remarkable 46 percent disapprove of his performance strongly.\n\nWomen overwhelmingly voted Democratic, giving them a 20 percent margin; men favored Republicans by just three points. Married women went for Democrats (55 to 43 percent) as did female independents (57 to 39 percent), white women (50 to 48 percent) and white college-educated women (60 to 38 percent). If there was one group that handed Democrats the House, it was women.\n\nTrump\u2019s assault on civility, overt racism, lying and bullying did not sit well with suburban voters who went for Democrats this time. (They went for Trump in 2016, 49 to 45 percent.) Republicans in suburban districts went down to defeat in droves \u2014 Reps. Barbara Comstock (Va.), Peter J. Roskam (Ill.), Kevin Yoder (Kan.), Pete Sessions (Tex.) and Mike Coffman (Colo.) were among the casualties.\n\nRepublicans who have vowed to take another shot at repealing Obamacare should be careful. About 40 percent of voters said they cared most about health care; of those 76 percent voted Democratic. Some 70 percent want major changes in health care; of those 55 percent chose Democrats.\n\nTrump wanted to make the race about immigration, so he tried to whip up his white, xenophobic base, with fearmongering about the caravan of migrants from Central America. But exit polls showed 47 percent think his immigration policies are too tough, compared to 33 percent who say they are about right and 16 percent who say too weak.\n\nTrump and the Republicans wanted Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to be front and center. While men narrowly approved of Kavanaugh (50 to 44 percent), women overwhelmingly disapproved of him (53 percent disapproval to 37 percent approval). Overall, a plurality opposed Kavanaugh (48 to 43 percent).\n\nFinally, the president spent two years or more trying to convince Americans that voter fraud is a huge problem. However, 54 percent said they see voter suppression as a bigger concern than voter fraud. And Trump\u2019s biggest ally in his phony voter fraud theories, Kris Kobach, lost the governor\u2019s race in Kansas.\n\nRepublicans will try to comfort themselves with their retention of the Senate majority. However, even there Democrats easily secured wins in states Trump picked up in 2016 (Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan). Winning in the deep red states (e.g., Indiana, North Dakota, Missouri) was hardly compensation for nationwide losses in the House, shrinking the GOP\u2019s map back to largely pre-2016 contours and losing a batch of governors\u2019 races, including Michigan (another Rust Belt loss) New Mexico, Illinois, Maine and Kansas. We are becoming a more divided country, 77 percent of respondents said in the exit polls. But the truth is we are not evenly divided. A party that has alienated women, nonwhites, suburbanites, urbanites, Midwesterners, Northeasterners, the college-educated and all but the over-65 demographic set has dim prospects for 2020.\n\nRead more:\n\nHere comes Trump\u2019s blame machine\n\nThe sane center can hold.

For various reasons, I'm pretty sure marriage is not in my future, and I feel happy the way I am.\n\nTherein lies the rub. I want to be a mom one day. I've always thought I should adopt, regardless of marital status, so the \"how\" is mostly figured out.\n\nMy family, though supportive of my single life, are very unsupportive of my becoming a single mom. Some of their reasons are reasonable \u2014 it's difficult to raise children alone, it might have negative consequences for my career, harder to get an adoption solo \u2014 others less so (what if the baby I adopt is a serial killer?). When I argue that plenty of people, even in our family, make it as single parents with less financial stability than I have, they say those people are just making the best of a bad situation. It would be way better for the child to have a dad, not need so much time in child care, etc. I feel like they're saying I'm being selfish for bringing a kid into this life on purpose.\n\nAm I trying to have my cake and eat it, too?\n\n\u2014 Wannabe Mom, Not Wannabe Wife\n\nWannabe Mom, Not Wannabe Wife: Well sure, it would be better for your would-be child to have a second parent.\n\nAnd better for you to raise a child with the help of a co-parent.\n\nIt would also be better for kids with one terrible parent to be raised solo by the other.\n\nAnd kids with two terrible parents to be raised by loving other relative(s), friend(s) or foster(s).\n\nAnd kids in sketchy day care to spend more time at home.\n\nAnd kids in sketchy homes to spend more time in day care.\n\nAnd better for a parent to fly solo when the co-parent turns out to be high-conflict or a no-show.\n\nAnd better for your career not to have kids.\n\nAnd better for your career to have the sharpening effect kids have on priorities, perspective and time-management.\n\nAnd better for a child to have healthy bonds vs. pat demographics.\n\nAnd so what I wonder is how your family can be so confident that their idea of the right way to raise a child will actually turn out right for the child you would have adopted but didn\u2019t because they managed to talk you out of it?\n\nIn a way, I admire their certainty.\n\nWait. No, I don\u2019t.\n\nBut it is useful if you co-opt it wisely: Give a good think to every disaster scenario they push. Even the serial killer one \u2014 not seriously, but seriously \u2014 since all would-be parents, biological and adoptive, face the possibility their kids\u2019 path will take them through hospitals, psych wards, courthouses or physical/occupational/social/educational/etc. therapies as far as their iCals can see.\n\n\u201cStatistically unlikely\u201d does not equal \u201cwill not happen.\u201d\n\nUse their pessimism to inform your decision.\n\nI\u2019m going to gussy up that last part: your decision. When duly informed, then decide. Scrutinized choices withstand family disapproval better anyway.\n\nUntil you decide, respond to unsupportive remarks with, \u201cSomething to consider, thanks.\u201d Afterward: \u201cI\u2019ve made up my mind, thanks.\u201d No further discussion.\n\nThe part about adoption being more difficult for singles? Yes. But that\u2019s between you and any agency you use, period. Start that research now.", "Democrats took control of the House on Tuesday night, a victory that will transform a Republican-controlled chamber that supported and protected President Trump into a legislative body ready to challenge and investigate him.\n\nVictories in GOP-held suburban seats around the country gave Democrats more than the 23 seats they needed to retake the majority, giving them control of half of Congress after being locked out of power since Trump took office last year.\n\nThey aim to quickly usher in a new era and tone in Washington, starting with a legislative package of anti-corruption measures aimed at strengthening ethics laws, protecting voter rights and cracking down on campaign finance abuses.\n\n\u201cTomorrow will be a new day in America,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) declared from the Democratic Party headquarters in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s about restoring the Constitutions\u2019s checks and balances to the Trump administration. It\u2019s about stopping the GOP and [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell\u2019s assaults on Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, and the health care of 130 million Americans living with preexisting medical conditions.\u201d\n\nPelosi promised action on lowering the cost of prescription drugs and rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure, and pledged to pursue bipartisanship where possible.\n\n\u201cA Democratic Congress will work for solutions that bring us together, because we have all had enough of division,\u201d she said.\n\n[2018 midterm elections: Results and analysis]\n\nTrump called Pelosi Tuesday night to congratulate her on her party\u2019s success and acknowledged her call for bipartisanship, her spokesman said.\n\nThere are, however, also many points of probable conflict between Trump and the next House: Democrats are likely to launch investigations into numerous aspects of the Trump administration, from its ties to Russia to the president\u2019s tax returns, as well as to step up oversight into Trump\u2019s executive actions on immigration, the environment and other regulations.\n\n\u201cObviously the country gave us a mandate to provide some check and balance on the executive that that has been sorely missing these last two years,\u201d said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.). \u201cAnd that involves rigorous oversight and accountability. ... This is not a time for holding back or being less than vigorous.\u201d\n\nA House takeover amounts to major vindication for Pelosi, who became the first female House speaker in 2006, only to lose the majority in 2010 as voters rebelled against former President Barack Obama's health care law in the first midterm elections of his presidency.\n\n1 of 98 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The scene as midterm votes were cast across the country View Photos Democrats and Republicans vied for control of the House and Senate. Caption Democrats and Republicans vied for control of the House and Senate. Katherine Frey/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nMidway through Trump\u2019s first term, the elections once again focused on health care, only this time Democrats were on the attack against Republicans, attacking the GOP over attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and its signature protections for people with preexisting conditions. Republicans who rode their opposition to Obamacare to the House majority in 2010 were forced to backtrack in race after race, insisting that they actually did support such protections.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hear it more for preexisting medical conditions,\u201d Pelosi said Tuesday night.\n\nPelosi will be the favorite to ascend to the speakership once more, though that outcome is not assured, as a number of Democratic candidates distanced themselves from her in the course of the campaign.\n\nDemocrats face internal ideological divisions as well. Their restored majority comes thanks to many moderate candidates who beat Republicans in districts that voted for Trump. But the party will also welcome newcomers who ran on distinctly progressive agendas, calling for Medicare-for-all or abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Those lawmakers include New York\u2019s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who beat longtime Democrat Joseph Crowley in a June primary, and Michigan\u2019s Rashida Tlaib, who is set to claim the seat once held by veteran lawmaker John Conyers Jr. in a deep-blue district.\n\nThat mix will be certain to create tensions over the party\u2019s priorities, especially with a restive liberal base that has already begun calling for impeachment proceedings against Trump.\n\nDemocrats also failed to take over the Senate, leaving the GOP-controlled chamber as a check against Democrats\u2019 ability to pass partisan legislation through Congress. That could mean an impasse on issues including immigration, gun regulations and health care.\n\nDemocrats picked up the seats they need in large part by targeting suburban districts where Trump had grown increasingly unpopular, through a relentless focus on health care and other economic issues. But their message didn\u2019t resonate as widely in rural areas, leaving them short of the massive \u201cblue wave\u201d some in the party had hoped for.\n\nIn the eastern suburbs of Denver and in Kansas City and Minneapolis-area districts, GOP incumbents fell to Democratic challengers. All three seats had been heavily targeted by Democrats in 2016, but this year was different.\n\nIn Northern Virginia, Republican incumbent Barbara Comstock lost to Democrat Jennifer T. Wexton, while in one surprise win, Democrat Max Rose \u2014 an Army combat veteran who focused his campaign on health care and the opioid crisis \u2014 unseated Rep. Dan Donovan (R-N.Y.) in a seat encompassing Staten Island and Queens. Donovan was the only Republican representing New York City.\n\nIn a disappointment for the Democrats, incumbent GOP Rep. Garland \u201cAndy\u201d Barr held off a strong challenge from Democrat Amy McGrath, a former fighter pilot. McGrath raised millions in small donations and rocketed into contention thanks to a viral video introducing her candidacy, but her bid fell short in a district where Trump beat Clinton by 15 percentage points.\n\nHeading into Election Day, Republicans had said their best-case scenario after Tuesday\u2019s voting was a narrower House GOP majority than the 45-seat margin they now command. Republicans had pledged that, if returned to power in the House, they would get to work on a new 10 percent tax cut for the middle class Trump spoke of in the closing days of the campaign.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known from the beginning that history was not on our side this election cycle. And the big money was not on our side,\u201d House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said, citing a \u201cmotivated base\u201d on the Democratic side who inundated Republican incumbents with small donations to their challengers.\n\nHouse Republicans also face leadership questions heading into the next Congress, as well as internal ideological differences.\n\nOn the GOP side, with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) retiring from Congress, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) is his likeliest successor as the top Republican leader in the majority or minority. But he may not get there without a fight, since Scalise is also eyeing the job, and Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), a leader of the House Freedom Caucus, is the choice of some conservatives.\n\nDespite the strong economy and Republicans\u2019 success in pushing a $1.5 trillion tax cut package into law, those achievements were not central to many GOP campaigns. Instead many Republicans followed Trump\u2019s lead in raising fears about immigrants and crime, while casting Democrats as overly liberal and linking them to Pelosi.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly described House winner Max Rose. The previous description of Rose as a former boxer mistakenly referred to a Democratic primary opponent.", "Scott Walker, governor of Wisconsin, right, poses for a photograph during a campaign rally in Waukesha, Wis., on Nov. 5. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg)\n\nDemocrat Andrew Gillum was defeated in his bid to become Florida\u2019s first black governor Tuesday, but the party flipped at least seven governorships after voters rejected some Republican candidates in the Midwest and the Sun Belt, including in Wisconsin, Kansas and New Mexico.\n\nAt times choking up during a speech at Florida A&M University, Gillum conceded his race to Republican Ron DeSantis, who is closely associated with President Trump.\n\n\u201cI sincerely regret that I couldn\u2019t bring it home for you,\u201d he told his supporters.\n\nGillum performed relatively well in Florida\u2019s cities and suburbs. But DeSantis won massive margins from Florida\u2019s rural counties, underscoring the advantage Republicans continue to hold in statewide elections there.\n\n\u201cThroughout the campaign, I knew the only thing I could control was how hard I worked,\u201d DeSantis said in his victory speech. \u201cAnd although I was confident in achieving a victory, I was at peace knowing I worked as hard as I possibly could, and I left everything out on the field.\u201d\n\nIncluding Florida\u2019s, the 36 gubernatorial races on state ballots offered examples of America\u2019s cultural and ideological divides under Trump.\n\nDemocrats flipped the governorships in Wisconsin, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Illinois, Nevada and New Mexico. The race remained too close to call in Georgia, where Democrat Stacey Abrams was running to become the first African American female governor.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Democrat Tony Evers bested Gov. Scott Walker, once a Republican star who ran for president in 2016. Walker survived a hard-fought recall vote in 2012, and was reelected in 2014, only to be denied a third term by the state schools superintendent.\n\nIn recent years, Walker has faced mounting voter concern about the condition of Wisconsin schools, but he also oversaw a robust state economy, including a 3 percent unemployment rate.\n\nIn Kansas, Democrat Laura Kelly defeated Secretary of State Kris Kobach, another Trump ally who is known for his unapologetic, hard-line views on immigration and who was the face of Trump\u2019s anti-voter-fraud panel.\n\n\u201cThis has been a battle to the finish,\u201d Kobach said during his concession speech. \u201cHeadwinds all the way for our team. But that\u2019s all right. We fought as hard as we could into those headwinds.\u201d\n\nIn Illinois, Democrat J.B. Pritzker easily defeated Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) after one of the nation\u2019s most expensive gubernatorial elections. Democrats also won the governorship in Michigan, where Gretchen Whitmer, a former state legislator, defeated Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette to replace term-limited Gov Rick Snyder (R).\n\nThe Republican governor of Nevada, Brian Sandoval, was also term-limited, and will be replaced by Democrat Steve Sisolak, who won out over Republican Adam Laxalt. \u201cToday, people from every corner of the state stood up and turned out to stay it\u2019s time to bring people together,\u201d Sisolak, a businessman and county commissioner, told supporters in a victory speech. \u201cIt\u2019s time to prioritize our schools, our jobs and our health care. It\u2019s time to stop the petty politics and get things done.\u201d\n\n\n\nNew Mexico voters selected Democratic Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham to replace outgoing Republican Gov. Susana Martinez. And in Maine, where Gov. Paul LePage (R) is term-limited, Democratic Attorney General Janet Mills defeated Republican Shawn Moody, a businessman.\n\nBut Democrats were nervously watching results in several other states. Abrams was trailing in her bid for Georgia\u2019s governorship against Secretary of State Brian Kemp, a conservative Republican whose office has been accused of trying to suppress voter turnout. Kemp had a sizeable lead, but some counties had yet to complete counts in the Atlanta metro area.\n\nIn a speech early Monday morning, Abrams refused to concede the race and said she was prepared to face Kemp in a runoff.\n\n\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t your first choice, or if you didn\u2019t make a choice at all, you\u2019re going to have a chance to do a do-over,\u201d said Abrams, who referenced attacks on voting rights that threatened minority votes in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cSome have worked hard to scare us away,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we see the finish line.\u201d\n\nRepublicans currently hold 33 of the nation\u2019s 50 governorships. Of the 36 gubernatorial races on the ballot Tuesday, Republicans were defending 26 of them.\n\nThe outcomes of those contests will have major implications for Democratic efforts to build a state-level firewall against some of Trump\u2019s policies, including his effort to overturn the Affordable Care Act and gut environmental and labor laws. In most states, governors and state legislatures will be drawing new congressional boundaries after the 2020 Census.\n\nSeveral of the most hotly contested gubernatorial races took place in Midwestern states that formed the linchpin of Trump\u2019s 2016 victory. Democratic leaders in those states view those contests as a major test of whether the party can win back the white working-class voters who abandoned the party in droves that year.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf (D) beat Republican Scott Wagner, a former state legislator, in a state Trump carried by 44,000 votes two years ago.\n\nIn Ohio, Democrat Richard Cordray, a former Obama administration official, lost to Republican Mike DeWine for the seat left open by term-limited Gov. John Kasich (R). The contest was widely viewed as a dead heat heading into Tuesday as Cordray and DeWine, the attorney general of Ohio, battled over health care, jobs and the state\u2019s opioid crisis.\n\nIn Iowa, Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, defeated Democrat Fred Hubbell.\n\nIowa has been trending Republican, including supporting Trump by about 10 percentage points in 2016. Hubbell sought to take advantage of voter unease over access to health insurance and the president\u2019s trade war with China, which could impact the state\u2019s agricultural community.\n\nRepublicans had additional reasons for optimism on Tuesday.\n\nOn the East Coast, Republican Govs. Larry Hogan of Maryland, Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and Phil Scott of Vermont, all moderates, won reelection.\n\nIn New Hampshire, Gov. Chris Sununu (R) defeated his Democratic challenger, Molly Kelly, a former state senator.\n\nRepublicans also saw an opportunity to win back the governor\u2019s mansion in Connecticut, where incumbent Dannel P. Malloy (D) decided not to seek a third term.\n\nDemocrat Ned Lamont and Republican Bob Stefanowski, both businessmen, battled in a race that heavily focused on taxes and the state\u2019s projected $2 billion budget deficit.\n\nIn Oklahoma, Democrat Drew Edmondson lost to Republican businessman Kevin Stitt, who campaigned as a strong supporter of Trump.\n\nAnd in South Dakota, Democrat Billie Sutton \u2014 a former rodeo star who was paralyzed in a 2007 riding accident \u2014 lost to Republican Rep. Kristi L. Noem.\n\nThe Democratic incumbent who seemed most at risk of losing this year was Gov. Kate Brown (D) in Oregon, but she handily beat her opponent, Republican Knute Buehler.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misidentified Gov. Chris Sununu\u2019s opponent. It has been corrected.\n\nRobert Samuels in Tallahassee, Vanessa Williams in Atlanta, and Annie Gowen, Scott Clement and Isaac Stanley-Becker in Washington contributed to this report.", "Republicans cemented control of the Senate for two more years Tuesday and positioned themselves for a more conservative majority, with victories by candidates who aligned closely with President Trump.\n\nNorth Dakota Rep. Kevin Cramer, Indiana businessman Mike Braun, and Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, all staunch Trump allies, won seats held by Democrats. Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R), another Trump loyalist, defeated a popular former governor in Tennessee.\n\nThe results held implications for coming battles over the federal judiciary, trade, health care, government spending and immigration. Trump\u2019s worldview is expected to be reflected strongly in those debates in the wake of Tuesday\u2019s elections.\n\nThe outcomes also held significance for Trump himself. His administration could face an onslaught of investigations beginning next year. Democrats took over in the House. Some Democrats have even raised the possibility of impeachment. Senate Republicans could be Trump\u2019s bulwark on Capitol Hill.\n\nTrump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) spoke Tuesday night, according to McConnell spokeswoman Antonia Ferrier. \u201cThe leader and the president had a great conversation, and he thanked the president for all his help,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Senate Democratic caucus, meanwhile, is poised to shift to the left. The ouster of key centrists willing work with Trump and the presence of several liberal senators gearing up for possible presidential runs could cause more polarization in the chamber.\n\n\n\nRep. Kevin Cramer, the Republican nominee for a U.S. Senate seat in North Dakota, defeated Democratic incumbent Heidi Heitkamp on Tuesday. (Bruce Crummy/AP)\n\n[Midterm elections: Democrats pick up a few House seats, but Senate hopes dim]\n\nWith the map in their favor, Republicans \u2014 who currently control both chambers of Congress \u2014 were on track to preserve and possibly expand their 51-to-49 advantage in the Senate. Analysts across the political spectrum had favored them to remain in power, even as they said Democrats were likely to wrest control of the House.\n\n\u201cI see two things,\u201d said Jim Manley, a former top Democratic Senate aide, looking ahead. \u201cA president unwilling to tone down his rhetoric, along with the Senate Republicans unwilling to break with him.\u201d\n\nSome of the most closely watched Senate races pitted centrist Democrats against conservative Republicans who ardently embraced Trump. Contests in Missouri, North Dakota, Indiana, West Virginia and Tennessee fell into this category.\n\nEven before Tuesday\u2019s vote, Senate Republicans were poised for a more pro-Trump roster next year. Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who have frequently voiced concerns about Trump\u2019s tone and his governing philosophy, are retiring. John McCain, a vocal Trump critic, died in August.\n\nDemocrats tried to defeat candidates who marched in lockstep with Trump by running on preserving health-care protections and other so-called \u201ckitchen table\u201d issues. In key races, they fell short.\n\nIn North Dakota, Cramer\u2019s defeat of Sen. Heidi Heitkamp means that one of the chamber\u2019s few moderate Democrats will be replaced by a close ally of Trump. Trump personally recruited Cramer to run. On major issues, Cramer endorsed Trump\u2019s positions.\n\nIn Indiana, Braun ran in Trump\u2019s mold, as an outsider eager to shake up Washington. He defeated a pair of House members in the Republican primary before beating centrist Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly on Tuesday.\n\nTwo states over in Missouri, Hawley ousted Sen. Claire McCaskill (D) in a race with similar dynamics. Hawley, like Cramer, championed Trump\u2019s views on trade, even as he faced criticism that farmers in his state would suffer under the president\u2019s tariffs.\n\nOne wild card next year is Mitt Romney. The former Republican presidential nominee won the seat of retiring Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R). Romney has criticized Trump, including in a speech opposing his candidacy in 2016. But lately, he has been less openly hostile to the president.\n\n[Democrats make play for state governorships with historic races in Florida and Georgia]\n\nSenate Democrats were defending 26 of the 35 seats on the ballot, including 10 in states Trump won. They were hoping to offset their losses with some gains.\n\nThey were able to pick up at least one seat in the Sun Belt, where Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) unseated Sen. Dean Heller (R), a onetime Trump critic who warmed up to the president during the campaign. Conceding defeat late Tuesday, Heller said, \u201cI take the blame,\u201d while Rosen, who is Jewish, cast her victory as a rejoinder to \u201call the hate that I\u2019ve seen recently, that we\u2019ve all seen.\u201d\n\nIn Arizona, Democratic leaders were hopeful that Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, a former Green Party activist who ran as a moderate Democrat, would win Flake\u2019s seat. But her opponent, Rep. Martha McSally, appeared to be in the lead early Wednesday morning. The onetime Trump critic came to embrace the president over the course of her campaign.\n\nFlorida, another state with a diverse population, was the site of the expensive and pivotal showdown between Sen. Bill Nelson (D) and Gov. Rick Scott (R). Scott, unlike most other top Senate candidates, distanced himself from the president in the campaign. The race was tight late Tuesday.\n\nMany Democratic Senate contenders railed against Trump\u2019s tariffs during the campaign. In Tennessee, former governor Phil Bredesen, who lost to Blackburn, cast the tariffs as harmful to the state\u2019s automobile, farming and whiskey industries.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin III (D) held on to his seat in West Virginia. Manchin was the only Democrat to vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. He has touted his cooperation with the president, and Republicans are expected to court his support in future votes.\n\nDemocrats were hopeful Jon Tester (D-Mont.) would keep his seat, despite Trump holding a rally in his state in the final stage of the campaign.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who clashed sharply with Trump in the 2016 primary, lined up squarely behind the president en route to his defeat of Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D), who achieved rock star status on the left.\n\nThe Senate Republican agenda is not expected to be nearly as ambitious as the past two years, when the GOP controlled the federal government following Trump\u2019s surprise win. The Democratic House takeover will likely be a major impediment to reaching an agreement on most big issues.\n\nStill, the Senate will still have to navigate some high-stakes battles. The Trump administration is preparing for a massive post-midterm shake-up, which could trigger nominations for attorney general and other Cabinet posts the Senate would be tasked with confirming in the months ahead.\n\nMcConnell has made confirming federal judges a top priority. That is a task carried out by the Senate alone, and McConnell\u2019s allies said that will continue to be a focal point in the next Congress.\n\n\u201cI think that the one thing that becomes really important, both to the administration and Senate Republicans, is to continue to be in the personnel business,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a former McConnell chief of staff and one of his closest confidants. \u201cI think remaking the judiciary is high on the agenda, no matter what.\u201d\n\nA looming debate over health care and the outcome of a Republican lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act could prompt further consideration of tweaks to the law. Immigration, which Trump and the Republicans made a centerpiece of their midterm pitch, could spark a new debate about border security funding.\n\nCongress will also have to approve or reject a sweeping trade deal Trump spearheaded with Mexico and Canada. More basic tasks such as funding the federal government have proved to be politically challenging in recent years and could be further complicated by an ideological shift on Capitol Hill.\n\nWhat voters decide Tuesday also will determine the starting point for the next fight for the Senate majority, in 2020. Republicans are facing a more difficult Senate map, with seats to defend in the purple states of Iowa, North Carolina, Colorado and Maine.\n\nMcConnell, who is also up in 2020, was hoping to pad the slim GOP cushion going into the next cycle. The looming races could also be a factor leading some GOP senators to distance themselves from Trump next year.\n\nBut Republican senators are still facing the threat of drawing a primary challenger if they are too hostile to Trump. Most party strategists have concluded that straying from him sharply out of the gate would be politically unwise.\n\nOne race that did not conclude on Tuesday was in Mississippi. The special election to succeed retired Republican Thad Cochran headed to a runoff on Nov. 27.\n\nIsaac Stanley-Becker contributed to this report.", "Conservatives who have learned to love President Trump, a relative newcomer to their movement, could emerge from Tuesday\u2019s election anxious that he might now leave them in the cold to cut deals with newly empowered congressional Democrats.\n\nOn the horizon are an array of hot-button issues that are top priorities for conservatives but could prove tempting areas of compromise for the famously transactional Trump as he seeks to repair his presidency ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nThose include the next federal budget and an expiring debt limit in March, along with potential bipartisan talks on politically sensitive matters such as immigration and health care, both of which have been central to the midterm campaign.\n\n\u201cHe has carried the ball as effectively as anybody for the right, but the reality is, there is not a deep philosophical bent there,\u201d said Ed Rollins, co-chairman of the pro-Trump Great America super PAC. \u201cHe\u2019s always been about getting what you can get.\u201d\n\nThe potential for a conservative reckoning comes at a fragile moment for a movement that had largely abided by traditional conservative principles on foreign and domestic policy since Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency but has in recent years moved sharply toward Trump\u2019s un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox and nativist politics.\n\nTrump has fundamentally redefined the modern Republican Party, lurching a historically free-trade institution toward protectionism on trade and infusing its appeals with racially charged conspiracy theories, rampant demagoguery and proud declarations that he is \u201cabsolutely a nationalist.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Trump walks from the Oval Office to Marine One in October. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThose cracks, however, have mostly been papered over as conservatives have relished their influence inside the White House and Republican majorities in both congressional chambers, beaming behind Trump in the Rose Garden and Oval Office as he has scribbled his signature on their bills. They have celebrated his role in revamping the federal judiciary, passing a sweeping tax cut and significantly increasing funding for the U.S. military.\n\nTrump, in turn, has come to view many of the conservatives in the Republican leadership as useful, effective allies.\n\n\u201cYou know, he goes down as the greatest leader, in my opinion, in history,\u201d Trump said of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) at a rally last month.\n\nYet, with Democrats having regained control the House, a new reality in Washington could unwind those relationships. And just as easily as Trump embraced conservatives, he could choose to leave them behind, a backbench minority with no clear leader and a hazy path forward.\n\nIn the coming weeks, House Republicans will hold leadership elections where loyalty to Trump could be prized more than conservative bona fides, as House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and other Trump allies are expected to launch bids, with few if any of them showing any interest in challenging his authority.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, could ignore budget hawks and the federal deficit and rally behind a more than $1 trillion infrastructure bill next year.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s able to move a bit because he is set with the conservatives for the next 10 years because he picked Pence and put two justices on the court,\u201d said John Brabender, a Republican consultant who works with Vice President Pence\u2019s team.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Tuesday on PBS\u2019s \u201cNewsHour\u201d that infrastructure \u201chas always been nonpartisan. Hopefully we can work together to advance that agenda.\u201d Pelosi, however, could face leadership challenges of her own in the coming weeks amid Democratic unrest.\n\n\u201cCan we get along? Maybe,\u201d Trump said last month on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d when asked about how he would handle a Democratic-controlled House.\n\nTrump could also work with Democrats to lower the cost of prescription drugs. That is a prospect that Pelosi acknowledged to PBS, saying it\u2019s possible \u201cif the president is serious.\u201d\n\nA year ago, Trump worked with Democrats on a spending agreement that alarmed conservatives \u2014 and reminded them that the former real estate investor and ex-Democrat could abandon their cause.\n\n\u201cThe deal is a warning to Republicans \u2014 primarily to the party establishment, which has fought Trump at every turn, but also to conservative Republicans, who have long worried about Trump shifting leftwards,\u201d Breitbart editor Joel B. Pollak wrote at the time on the hard-line conservative website.\n\nAnother ominous prospect for GOP leaders is Trump raging at his party and using them as a target as much as the Democrats, should he lash out over coming struggles and stalled items on his to-do list.\n\nIn the Senate, where Republicans appeared to be expanding their majority on Tuesday, there have been tensions between Trump and Republicans in the past year, particularly with more centrist voices such as retiring Republican Sens. Bob Corker (Tenn.) and Jeff Flake (Ariz.).\n\n\u201cThe grass-roots conservatives are screaming for new leadership in Congress and he could play into that,\u201d longtime conservative operative Richard Viguerie said.\n\nAn obstacle for conservatives wary of a coming Trump breach is his dominance and popularity within the conservative media and his extraordinary reach on social platforms. His stature on the right and ubiquity on the airwaves makes it difficult for any criticism or GOP rival to get traction.\n\nWhen retiring House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) spoke out against Trump\u2019s call to end birthright citizenship, for example, Trump dismissed him with a tweet, writing, \u201cPaul Ryan should be focusing on holding the Majority rather than giving his opinions on Birthright Citizenship, something he knows nothing about!\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, how do you think a primary would go? Not great, okay?\u201d Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), a Trump critic considering a 2020 bid against Trump, told MSNBC this week, nodding to that hurdle.\n\nThere is a precedent for presidents moving toward the political center following midterm reckonings. After the GOP takeover of the House in 1994, President Bill Clinton worked with then-Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich on passing a balanced budget and overhauling welfare rules. President Barack Obama huddled with House Republicans after they won the chamber in 2010 and sought out a bipartisan deficit-reduction agreement, but the talks eventually collapsed.\n\nGingrich rejected the suggestion that Trump could follow the Clinton example and change his political persona.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really no hope of that \u2014 he\u2019s not Clinton,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cAfter doing all of these rallies, he\u2019s not going to suddenly start undermining his own political base and his own reelection chances. He knows that if you start to play the role that Bill Clinton tried to play, your base is going to hate you.\u201d\n\nDavid Gergen, a former senior adviser to Democrat and Republican presidents, including Clinton, said \u201chistory suggests that smart presidents usually self-correct after these moments, they take stock.\u201d\n\nDespite the angst over Trump, many conservative leaders argue that the alliance with the president has been worth it even if it may be fleeting or turbulent, generating scores of legislative and policy advances that their movement had unsuccessfully pursued for years until Trump won office.\n\nBefore Trump, anti-tax activist Grover Norquist long said that the conservative movement was simply seeking a president with \u201cenough working digits to handle a pen\u201d that could sign their bills into law.\n\nIn Trump, conservatives found a willing if erratic champion \u2014 and Norquist is optimistic he will still hew to the right.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t some deal with us, some collective choice. Trump won,\u201d Norquist said. \u201cAnd Trump has been more Reagan than Reagan on judges, tax and regulatory policy. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d", "", "People gather around a Ben & Jerry\u2019s \u201cYes on 4\u201d truck as they learn about Florida\u2019s amendment to restore voting rights last month. (Wilfredo Lee/AP)\n\nAs millions of Floridians went to the polls Tuesday to elect new state and federal officials, they also considered another issue that could dramatically shape future elections there: Florida voters decided to amend the state constitution to automatically restore the voting rights of felons after they complete their sentences.\n\nThe proposal was one of a bevy of policy initiatives on ballots Tuesday, giving voters across the country direct control over issues as varied as health care, the minimum wage, drug policy and, in California, time itself.\n\nPassage of the constitutional amendment in Florida will extend voting rights to as many as 1.6 million felons disenfranchised as a result of their criminal convictions. The flood of new voters could disrupt a balance between the two parties in future elections in a state that has traditionally had some of the closest outcomes in the country. The result came on the same night that Democrats and Republicans were again locked in exceptionally tight battles for a Senate seat and the governor\u2019s mansion.\n\nProposed constitutional amendments in Florida require the approval of at least 60 percent of voters for passage, a bar that voters cleared Tuesday night.\n\nFlorida had been one of just four states to permanently prohibit felons from voting. Under previous law, felons had to apply to the governor for clemency on an individual basis \u2014 just 3,000 people had successfully navigated the process and had their rights restored in the past eight years.\n\nThe proposal was supported by a diverse array of interest groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Catholic bishops and a political action committee connected to the conservative Koch brothers. Singer John Legend also was a supporter.\n\nElection day in photos: The quiet power of Americans voting \u2014 and the rush of victory and defeat From Florida to Arizona, Massachusetts to Georgia, California to Texas, here are the best photos from the midterms shot by Washington Post photographers.\n\n\n\nThe initiative, which would exclude people convicted of murder or sexual offenses, had also become an issue in Florida\u2019s hotly contested gubernatorial race. The Democratic nominee, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, endorsed its passage; Republican Ron DeSantis, a former congressman, opposed it.\n\n\u201cIf you have done your time and you\u2019ve paid your debt to society, you ought to be able to reenter society and have your constitutional right to vote and to work here in this state,\u201d Gillum said during a recent debate.\n\nDeSantis countered: \u201cI want people to be redeemed. But you\u2019ve got to prove that you\u2019re getting back with the law.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, voters in three reliably Republican-leaning states \u2014 Idaho, Nebraska and Utah \u2014 were considering ballot initiatives to expand Medicaid under the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Voters in a fourth state, Montana, were weighing whether to extend a Medicaid expansion that was adopted in 2015 and would otherwise expire next year.\n\nObamacare was designed to expand the low-income health-care program automatically, with much of the cost borne by the federal government. But the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states should be allowed to decide for themselves whether to expand it.\n\nSince the ruling, 33 states and the District of Columbia have expanded coverage to those who earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line and struggled to purchase insurance. Democrats generally have supported the expansion while Republicans have opposed it, in some cases vociferously, using it as a symbol of their opposition to the Democrats\u2019 signature health-care law.\n\nBut Republican opposition to the expansion has softened, particularly as polls have showed the expansion to be popular with voters, making the outcome of the ballot initiatives in the three heavily Republican states particularly interesting. In each of the states, voters were given the opportunity to overturn the actions of state legislatures, which have previously rejected expansion.\n\nIn Idaho, outgoing Gov. C.L. \u201cButch\u201d Otter (R) endorsed the proposition late last month, arguing that the measure would extend health care to 62,000 people, snare $400 million in federal tax money and stabilize financially struggling rural hospitals. The proposal was running ahead in early returns in all three states, with a particularly strong showing in Idaho.\n\nElsewhere, voters considered a variety of other issues.\n\nIn two Republican-led states, voters considered whether to raise the minimum wage, a test of the popularity of the proposal among GOP voters whose leaders have traditionally opposed the hikes as bad for business.\n\nIn Arkansas, voters considered whether to gradually raise the state\u2019s minimum wage from $8.50 an hour to $11 an hour by 2021. And in Missouri, voters weighed whether to raise the $7.85 minimum to $12 an hour by 2023. Both measures appeared to pass.\n\nVoters in four states faced measures that would loosen laws that govern the usage of marijuana, part of a national shift toward decriminalization of pot. The ballot measures in Michigan and North Dakota would legalize the recreational use of the drug. Early returns showed that the proposal appeared likely to win approval in Michigan but was running significantly behind in North Dakota. In Missouri and Utah, voters considered whether to allow marijuana\u2019s use for medicinal purposes. Early returns showed the proposal trailing in Missouri but likely to prevail in Utah.\n\nWashington state voters on Tuesday considered adopting the nation\u2019s most aggressive effort to combat climate change, a carbon tax that would impose a $15-per-ton fee on some emissions, automatically rising over time.\n\nSupporters said the tax was a way to discourage the use of energy sources that are leading to the planet\u2019s rising temperatures. Opponents argued that the tax would hurt businesses and low-income residents. With nearly two-thirds of the state\u2019s vote counted, the measure appeared likely headed to defeat.\n\nIn California, which has a long tradition of putting major policy decisions to popular vote on the ballot, voters considered 11 separate measures.\n\nOne proposal would repeal a 12-cent-a-gallon gas tax that was adopted by the legislature last year to raise money to improve state roads. Another proposal would allow cities and counties to enforce rent control on more buildings, part of an effort to control runaway housing costs.\n\nA third measure could affect how Californians tell time. In the sunshine-loving state, the measure would start a process that could result in California adopting daylight saving time all year. The system would mean that clocks would not change in California when the rest of the country changed time in the fall and spring. If the measure passes, the legislature will still need to approve it by a two-thirds vote and federal law will need to be changed.\n\nThis article has been updated.", "", "Republican Gov.

However, the Japanese kickboxing phenom is already getting into it with Conor McGregor, following profane insults from the UFC superstar.\n\nMcGregor posted a photo Monday to social media showing Mayweather and Nasukawa at a news conference they\u2019d held to announce the fight, which will take place near Tokyo under a yet-to-be-determined format. After mocking Mayweather for the outfit he was wearing, McGregor wrote in his caption, \u201cWhat in the f--- is going on here?

Mayweather had come out of retirement to take on the Irishman in a much-hyped bout that provided both with massive paydays, and even before squaring off with Khabib Nurmagomedov last month for the UFC lightweight title, McGregor was expressing interest in a rematch.\n\n\u201cIf [Mayweather] has the bottle to come over and deal with this, like he said he has, let\u2019s see what happens,\u201d McGregor said in October (via ESPN). \u201cI would also like to box him again.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s either a straight MMA bout or a straight boxing bout,\u201d he added at the time. \u201cIf they come looking for modified rules, I would rather just box the kid again.\u201d\n\nNurmagomedov, who maintained his own undefeated record in submitting McGregor in their bout, also said he would like to take on Mayweather, but the 41-year-old boxer chose a different option, one that surprised many when word of the Nasukawa fight emerged on Sunday. Mayweather explained at the news conference that he was eager to bolster his partnership with the Japanese company staging the fight, while growing his brand in that country.\n\n\u201cAs far as the weight class and the rules, we\u2019ll talk about that and we\u2019ll get that situated within the next couple of weeks,\u201d said Mayweather, who generally has fought at about 30 pounds heavier than Nasukawa does. \u201cThis particular bout is a special bout as far as we\u2019re giving the people something they\u2019ve never seen before. The world has never seen Mayweather compete live in Tokyo.\"\n\nAt 20, Nasukawa is less than half the age of Mayweather, but he has already attained an impressive record as a professional fighter, having gone 27-0 in kickboxing, with 21 knockouts, and 4-0 in MMA, with two knockouts. His burgeoning fame ensures that there will be plenty of interest in the Mayweather fight in Japan and other parts of Asia, while McGregor, perhaps inadvertently, seems to be doing his part to bring it attention in the United States and elsewhere.\n\nMcGregor, though, also brought himself criticism for his comments, with some calling him racist for likening Nasukawa to the Hong Kong-born Chan. McGregor has been accused of racially insensitive trash-talking before, notably after taunting Mayweather during the run-up to their fight with the line, \u201cDance for me, boy!\u201d\n\nMcGregor subsequently denied being racist, saying, \u201cDid they not know I\u2019m half-black? Yeah, I\u2019m half-black from the bellybutton down.\"\n\nMayweather has faced similar criticism in the past, including after calling Manny Pacquiao, the Filipino boxer he defeated in 2015, a \u201clittle yellow chump\u201d and saying that he would force Pacquiao to make him a \u201csushi roll.\u201d\n\nAfter beating McGregor in October, Nurmagomedov made it clear that he had felt deeply insulted by his opponent\u2019s pre-fight trash-talking about the Russian\u2019s \u201chomeland, religion, nation, family.\u201d That contributed to a post-fight melee, for which both UFC stars have been suspended by the Nevada Athletic Commission as it investigates the incident.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nUFC 230: Daniel Cormier makes quick work of Derrick Lewis to retain heavyweight title\n\nSources: Nationals made Bryce Harper \u2018aggressive offer\u2019 last month, did not reach agreement\n\nA young rugby player ate a slug on a \u2018mate\u2019s\u2019 dare.

Ralph Northam and ousting all but one Republican state lawmaker who shared territory with Comstock.\n\nDemocrats felt good about their chances from the start. Polls showed Trump was unpopular in the district overall and demographics were shifting in their favor with more well-educated, diverse professionals moving in all the time.\n\nThe national focus helped Comstock and Wexton raise nearly $5.4 million, with Wexton slightly ahead.\n\nOutside spending also flooded the district. The groups spent about $5.9 million on behalf of Wexton and about $5.5 million on behalf of Comstock, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nAlthough public polls showed Comstock behind, the National Republican Congressional Committee stuck by her, shoveling money into the race when others, such as the Congressional Leadership Fund, took a pass.\n\nOn the eve of the election, former president Barack Obama, with a box of doughnuts in hand, made a surprise visit to Fairfax to rally Wexton and Kaine loyalists.\n\nComstock, a former GOP \u00adoperative who investigated the Clintons in the 1990s, tapped friends to raise money at the highest levels of national politics, from Vice President Pence to House Speaker Paul D.

Tim Kaine cruised to reelection as voters turned out in strong numbers around the state.\n\nState Sen. Jennifer T. Wexton defeated incumbent Rep. Barbara Comstock in the 10th District in suburban Washington, and newcomer Elaine Luria unseated Rep. Scott W. Taylor in the Hampton Roads area\u2019s 2nd District.\n\nIn a close race that went down to the last few precincts, Democrat Abigail Spanberger pushed past Rep. Dave Brat in the 7th District in the Richmond suburbs.\n\nThe wins exceeded expectations of even Democratic leaders and boosted the party\u2019s successful efforts to regain control of the House of Representatives \u2014 in a state that only a generation ago was reliably Republican. Yet again, female candidates delivered big for Democrats in Virginia, just a year after another slate of women made huge gains in House of Delegates races.\n\nComstock failed to win a third term in a district that had been comfortably Republican for almost 40 years. Wexton, a state senator and former prosecutor, rolled up wide margins in the increasingly diverse suburbs of Loudoun County.\n\nKaine, a popular former governor and Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 running mate, easily defeated Corey A. Stewart, the Prince William County supervisor who had promised a vicious campaign in the style of President Trump.\n\nNational Democrats had spent heavily to defeat Comstock as part of a bid to regain control of the House. Virginia was an early test of that strategy, with an unusual number of competitive House races and polls that closed before many others around the country.\n\nDemocrats had targeted four of Virginia\u2019s 11 congressional seats as potential flips, and Wexton led Comstock in public polls for months. But the prospect of two more pickups in Richmond and Hampton Roads made Democrats giddy.\n\n\u201cVirginia showed who we are and who we aren\u2019t,\u201d Kaine said at his victory celebration at a hotel in Falls Church where he was joined by Gov.

Luria said Taylor had called her to pledge to work together for a smooth transition.\n\nOutside Richmond, Spanberger\u2019s supporters shed tears, smiled and held hands as their candidate declared victory. \u201cThey said this district was unwinnable, but this campaign was always about giving people something to vote for,\u201d Spanberger said after becoming the first Democrat to win there since at least 1968.\n\nRepublicans held on to an open seat when Denver Riggleman beat Democrat Leslie Cockburn in the 5th District near Charlottesville. But that was little solace for some.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a veteran of the blue wave of 2017.

And GOP officials in several states, including Georgia, tried to impose restrictions on voters that some voting rights advocates said harked back to suppression tactics against blacks in the Jim Crow South.\n\nOther minority candidates, however, did claim historic outcomes.\n\nSharice Davids in Kansas and Debra Haaland in New Mexico both won their bids to become the first Native American female members of Congress. Minnesota\u2019s Ilhan Omar and Michigan\u2019s Rashida Tlaib will head to Washington as the first Muslim women in Congress.\n\nAnd in Colorado, Jared Polis became the first openly gay man voted in as governor.\n\nThe unprecedented racial, gender and religious diversity of Tuesday\u2019s candidates at federal and state levels provided a rare chance to test exactly how far long-standing barriers could be pushed \u2014 particularly during a midterm deeply influenced by President Trump\u2019s rhetoric tapping into resentments between whites and minorities.\n\nGillum held his election-night party on the lawn at Florida A&M University, his alma mater. The crowd waited through a thunderstorm and heavy rain and remained festive as early results came in. But the numbers never turned definitively in his favor.\n\nShortly after 11 p.m., many clutched their arms over their hearts as the 39-year-old Gillum choked up during his concession speech. \u201cI sincerely regret that I couldn\u2019t bring it home for you,\u201d he told them.\n\n1 of 98 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The scene as midterm votes were cast across the country View Photos Democrats and Republicans vied for control of the House and Senate.

You brought it home!\u201d\n\nIssues of race permeated contests across the board, heightened in recent weeks by Trump. He hyped the dangers of a migrant caravan headed for the United States by calling it an \u201cinvasion.\u201d He proposed revoking birthright citizenship, and his campaign released an ad that major television networks eventually deemed too racist to air.\n\nBy running on racially tinged messages, Republicans in some ways put those explosive tactics on the ballot. Some activists feared the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s vote would be seen especially by Republicans as a validation of such blunt attacks.\n\n\u201cWe know that racism divides people, but we have also seen that racial justice also unites and motivates people,\u201d said Rashad Robinson, president of the racial justice group Color of Change. \u201cThis is not a matter of Trump\u2019s frame being the more compelling one. It\u2019s about his platform being the larger one.\u201d\n\nSupporters of Abrams remained upbeat late into the night, clinging to the possibility the race could still turn in her favor. Shortly after midnight, the chants began among those gathered at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Atlanta:\n\n\u201cSta-cey!\u201d\n\n\u201cA-brams!\u201d\n\nIn a speech around 1:40 a.m., their candidate did not concede the race but instead signaled Georgians that they might have a chance to vote for her again in a possible runoff.\n\n\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t your first choice, or if you didn\u2019t make a choice at all, you\u2019re going to have a chance to do a do-over,\u201d said Abrams, referencing the attacks on minority voting rights.\n\nSome have worked hard \u201cto scare us away,\u201d she added. \u201cBut we see the finish line.\u201d\n\nThose stumping for Abrams and Gillum included a virtual who\u2019s who list of black political royalty and celebrity: singer-actress Rihanna, Oprah Winfrey, former president Barack Obama. Yet their star power didn\u2019t make them any less of a target of both direct and subtle racial digs.\n\nLess than a day after Gillum won his party\u2019s primary, DeSantis told a crowd that voters can\u2019t afford to \u201cmonkey this up,\u201d a turn of phrase many interpreted as a racist dog whistle.\n\nShortly afterward, the Democrat was the subject of a \u201cWe Negroes\u201d robo-call that featured the sounds of drums and monkeys in the background. \u201cWell, hello there. I is Andrew Gillum,\u201d the call began. \u201cWe Negroes . . . done made mud huts while white folk waste a bunch of time making their home out of wood an\u2019 stone.\u201d\n\nIn Georgia, one of the most racially charged jabs at the 44-year-old Abrams came in the form of a robo-call to voters last week that featured a voice impersonating Oprah Winfrey and calling Abrams \u201ca poor man\u2019s Aunt Jemima.\u201d\n\nSandra Brandon caught a glimpse of Abrams when she popped into the Busy Bee Cafe on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in Atlanta on Tuesday afternoon. The Rev. Jesse Jackson was there to greet her.\n\nBrandon, who remembers when segregationists such as Lester Maddox ruled the government in the late 1960s, said Abrams\u2019s candidacy is \u201cvery important. It\u2019s like Obama \u2014 something that you thought would never happen, that you dreamed might, but not in my lifetime.\u201d\n\nIn the election\u2019s closing days, Trump strongly criticized both Democratic candidates, calling Gillum \u201cnot equipped\u201d and Abrams \u201cnot qualified\u201d to be governor despite their long experience in government. Tuesday, the president took fresh aim at Gillum, claiming that he would turn Florida into \u201ca crime-ridden, overtaxed mess\u201d if elected.\n\nVoter access remained a concern in Georgia into the evening given the policies that Kemp tried to push through. His current position as secretary of state puts him in charge of election operations \u2014 essentially making him both competitor and referee. According to preliminary results by AP VoteCast\u2019s Georgia survey, nearly 3 in 10 voters in that race said they were not confident that people eligible to vote would be allowed to do so.\n\nKemp\u2019s actions as secretary of state came under sharp scrutiny in the wake of an Associated Press report that he had stalled more than 50,000 voter registrations by disproportionately black voters under the state\u2019s \u201cexact match\u201d signature requirements.\n\nFriday, a federal judge ordered Georgia to change its procedures to make it easier for some people flagged under the state\u2019s restrictive law to cast a ballot.\n\nRegardless of the final result in these and other banner races, activists in black communities said the 2018 election redefined their efforts. Many of the groups that have been most active did not even exist until when Trump became president.\n\nAtlanta activist LaTosha Brown, 47, attributes the increase in black candidates on the ballot to African Americans who decided to take control of their political fates rather than leave those in the hands of the Democratic Party. Two years ago, Brown co-founded Black Voters Matter, a grass-roots effort focused on organizing and mobilizing African Americans across the South. Since 2016, several other political groups have come into being, including Black PAC, Collective PAC and Woke Vote.\n\n\u201cOur community had a wake-up call in 2016,\u201d Brown said, citing the election of Trump and his choice of advisers like Stephen K. Bannon and cabinet members like Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \u201cWe knew that we could not continue down this road. We recognized that our fate could not be tied to waiting on someone else to save us.\u201d\n\nMatt Viser, Scott Clement, Cleve R. Wootson Jr. and Eugene Scott contributed to this report.", "An AI robot developed by the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology is on display at a trade show in Chiba, Japan, last month. (Noriko Hayashi/Bloomberg News)\n\nColumnist\n\nA conference here to gather American business and military experts to discuss the coming revolution in artificial intelligence was a good Election Day measure of the challenges ahead to maintain the U.S. competitive edge.\n\nCorporate and government leaders agree that China\u2019s rapid application of AI to business and military problems should be a \u201cSputnik moment\u201d to propel change in America. As a top-down command economy, China is directing money and its best brains to develop the smart systems that will operate cars, planes, offices and information \u2014 along with the transformation of warfare.\n\nThe United States is struggling to respond to this world-changing challenge. What\u2019s underway is frail and exists mostly on paper. Congress this year passed legislation calling for a national AI commission, but so far it\u2019s just a concept. The Pentagon in June established a new Joint Artificial Intelligence Center that will spend $1.75 billion over six years, but critics fear it will be far short of what\u2019s needed.\n\n\u201cThere is no quarterback\u201d for AI, says Amy Webb, author of a forthcoming book called \u201cThe Big Nine \u201d about the top U.S. and Chinese AI companies. The United States started with a technology lead, but U.S. efforts are dispersed and decentralized. Companies have trouble sharing the structured data that machines can learn on.\n\n\u201cChina is the OPEC of data,\u201d argues Webb. In a totalitarian society, every human and social interaction feeds a vast pool of structured data for machines to ingest. The Chinese government can then commandeer companies and people, as needed.\n\nAmerica may need an \u201cAI czar,\u201d argues Ashton B. Carter, former secretary of defense for President Barack Obama. That\u2019s because no current agency or White House office is empowered to coordinate an effort as complicated as the Manhattan Project, which built a nuclear weapon, or the \u201cspace race\u201d that put a man on the moon. But mobilizing resources in this way requires political vision and leadership, which are lacking today in both parties.\n\n\u201cChina has a national strategy and is executing it. That\u2019s what\u2019s missing. There is no compelling overarching policy,\u201d argues Paul Scharre, who studies AI at the Center for a New American Security. \u201cIt has to be a national effort, especially in terms of talent management,\u201d agrees Robert Work, a former deputy secretary of defense.\n\nWork argues that a good start would be an AI \u201ctraining corps,\u201d a bit like the National Guard. The Pentagon would pay for advanced technical education in exchange for two days a month of training with government systems and two weeks a year for major exercises. Members of the corps could keep their regular jobs at Microsoft or Google, say, but might be called up in a national emergency.\n\nAn awkward problem for America now is that the employees of the biggest and best AI companies seem reluctant to work with the U.S. government. After the Edward Snowden revelations, tech companies and their employees got nervous about appearing too cooperative with government intelligence programs. For example, when Google this year agreed to help the Pentagon develop battlefield algorithms in \u201cProject Maven,\u201d so many employees signed protest petitions that the company had to back out.\n\nMicrosoft bravely announced last month that it would sell advanced technologies needed \u201cto build a strong defense\u201d to military and intelligence agencies. But there\u2019s still a culture clash between Silicon Valley software engineers, many of whom see themselves as libertarian members of a global community, and defense planners, whose overriding priority is to build systems that assure American dominance in any future conflict.\n\nWe can see all our national strengths and weaknesses in the AI debate: a smart, dynamic private sector (on display here at the \u201cTime Machine 2018\u201d conference, sponsored by SparkCognition) but weak public leadership; proud military services that unfortunately are tied to legacy weapons systems such as manned fighter jets and giant aircraft carriers; a public education system that doesn\u2019t prepare students well for the tech jobs that matter; a broken immigration policy that doesn\u2019t serve our economic needs.\n\nAfter the midterm elections, the country will begin a heated debate about the best candidate to lead the nation in the 2020 elections. One way to assess potential leaders is to ask how they would meet the AI challenge of refashioning our economic and strategic foundations. A bitterly divided country with a dysfunctional political system isn\u2019t going to win the race anywhere, except down.\n\nAsk yourself who could lead a national push to capture the high ground of technology, and you may come up with the name of the man or woman who should be our next president.\n\nRead more from David Ignatius\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", ""]
