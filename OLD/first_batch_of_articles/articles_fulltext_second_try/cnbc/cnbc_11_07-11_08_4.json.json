["Cramer Remix: Why ETFs can be dangerous for stocks and investors 7:01 PM ET Thu, 8 Nov 2018 | 01:05\n\nThe rise of exchange-traded funds has made entire groups of stocks \"nothing but chits in a bizarre game of stock market roulette,\" CNBC's Jim Cramer said Thursday.\n\n\"The FANG stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now Alphabet \u2014 are in 10 different ETFs, so on any given day, their movements tend to be driven by the action in the ETFs and not the other way around,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"The tail is wagging the dog.\"\n\nAnd, unfortunately, \"FANG's not even the worst of it,\" Cramer said. He warned of certain \"hidden\" ETFs that try to mirror the actions of portfolio managers, using derivative instruments to make bets on professional investors' bets.\n\nCalling those funds \"totally abusive, moronic, horrible,\" Cramer said big companies whose stocks appear in those ETFs should bring a case against \"ETF peddlers\" as a way to solve the potentially harmful trend.\n\n\"At the end of the day, these ETFs can be very useful for day traders, but normal investors pay a terrible price because it makes the whole business of stock picking much more difficult, and, ... yes, far more futile than it should be,\" he said.", "Stocks in Asia were broadly lower on the final trading day of the week after the U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at its latest policy meeting.\n\nThe big mover to the downside was in Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng index fell 2.39 percent to close at 25,601.92.\n\nThe mainland China markets, which investors are watching closely as trade tensions between Washington and Beijing continue to weigh on sentiment, ended the trading week lower. The Shanghai composite shed 1.39 percent to close at around 2,598.87 and the Shenzhen composite declined by 0.434 percent to about 1,328.19.\n\nThe moves in China followed the country's Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index for the month of October coming in at 2.5 percent and 3.3 percent higher, respectively, compared to a year ago. Those numbers were in line with expectations from a Reuters poll.\n\nOne economist warned that relations between the U.S. and China could get more frosty now that the midterm elections stateside are over.\n\n\"The upshot is that there will be more noise and volatility on China,\" TS Lombard's chief U.S. economist, Steve Blitz, said in a note on Thursday, commenting on the post-election environment. Many Democrats, including Sen. Chuck Schumer, are \"China hawks,\" Blitz said.\n\nAnother market observer said the expected meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping during the upcoming G-20 summit is unlikely to yield results.\n\n\"I wouldn't bank on seeing anything solid on the back of that actually play through,\" Kerry Craig, a global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Friday. Still, he predicted the meeting between the two leaders would be \"very cordial.\"", "Amazon is the best makeshift revenue story in tech, says Mark Mahaney 3:33 PM ET Thu, 8 Nov 2018 | 03:02\n\nAmazon's next big move could be taking on the giants of the delivery industry, RBC Capital Markets' Mark Mahaney told CNBC on Thursday.\n\n\"There's another investment cycle coming, and I bet you it's around shipping and them actually coming out and directly competing with FedEx and UPS,\" the lead internet analyst said on \"Power Lunch.\" \"I think it's just a matter of time before that happens and it will be an investment cycle in front of that.\"\n\nMahaney called Amazon \"the best revenue makeshift story in tech\" because its cloud and advertising segments have margins tenfold the size of its retail business. The company is in position to reach all-time highs, he said.\n\n\"You can now think about this company as being a double-digit operating margin company,\" Mahaney said. \"You couldn't have thought that over the last 20 years that I've been covering this company.\"\n\nThe internet giant recently said it would deliver packages for free during the holiday shopping season. That comes at a time when wages and shipping costs have been rising.\n\n\"Knowing Amazon, I wouldn't be at all surprised to see them be willing to take down margins that they thought could really get a boost in terms of customer loyalty, more Prime customers, etc.,\" Mahaney said.\n\nRumors have swirled that Amazon would get into the delivery business since 2016. The Seattle-based online retailer most recently made strides in delivery and logistics with its own last-mile Delivery Service Partners. The tech firm has also established Amazon Flex delivery in more than 50 cities across the country.\n\nFedEx, which says shipments from Amazon make up about 3 percent of its revenue, has downplayed the nascent delivery service, saying it's not a match to the infrastructure the shipping giant has built up over more than four decades.\n\nAmazon has said its shipping costs, which continue to rise, have spiked from $11.5 billion in 2015 to $21.7 billion in 2017.", "Foot Locker Inc.: \"I've got to tell you, I think Foot Locker's OK, but it would've been a lot better in the $30s.

That's more than we sold of the first 'Red Dead Redemption' in eight years,\" Zelnick, chairman and CEO of the Rockstar Games parent, told Jim Cramer in an interview. \"Oh, and by the way, the first 'Red Dead Redemption' was a huge hit.\"\n\n\"Red Dead Redemption 2\" made headlines last week for its bombastic opening weekend. Take-Two called the $725 million in sales generated by the game \"the single-biggest opening weekend in the history of entertainment.\"\n\nNoting that the game overshot even Take-Two's internal expectations, Zelnick said on \"Mad Money\" that \"Red Dead's\" Wild-West-style, action-adventure theme works well in times of extreme social sentiment.\n\n\"Westerns seem to find a place at certain times when the populous is feeling a certain way,\" he told Cramer. \"Typically, in really good times, often in really bad times \u2014 you can decide what kind of times these are \u2014 I will say that I think the sprawling universe that's offered by Take-Two, the extraordinary opportunities to explore that universe and the deep and meaningful story combine with great gameplay to create a great experience.\"\n\nTake-Two's second-quarter earnings results topped revenue expectations, helped by the release of \"Red Dead\" and by in-game consumer spending, which Zelnick said was up 28 percent year over year.\n\nQualms over Take-Two's NBA 2K 2019 game \u2014 the next in its widely followed basketball franchise \u2014 were overblown, the CEO added, noting that net bookings were up 10 percent year over year and that it was still the \"biggest-selling sports game\" for 2018.\n\nShares of Take-Two fell 5.3 percent intraday on Thursday, sliding further in extended trading.", "Chinese President Xi Jinping is making peace with his country's private companies.\n\nThat reassurance comes amid an environment in which privately owned enterprises have taken a hit from banks constricting lending in a national effort to rein in debt. On top of that, confidence has been shaken on concerns private firms were falling out of political favor in relation to their powerful state-owned brethren.\n\nNow, facing trade war with the United States and a slowing economy, Xi is offering the sector an olive branch, which analysts and investors say is necessary to boost confidence in the critical job-providing sector.\n\nChina's big state-owned enterprises have long enjoyed exalted status, with preferential access to funding and other benefits. And despite years of reform talk, their political influence has actually been seen to grow in recent years.\n\nBut at a symposium last Thursday with private entrepreneurs and reported by the official Xinhua news agency, Xi sought to make amends, promising measures including lower taxes and improved financing, while also offering soothing words of inclusion.\n\n\"All private companies and private entrepreneurs should feel totally reassured and devote themselves to seeking development,\" Xi said at the event, according to Xinhua. \"Private enterprises and private entrepreneurs belong to our own family.\"\n\nAndy Xie, an independent economist formerly with Morgan Stanley, said Xi's words may have a positive psychological impact but action will be more critical.\n\nXie told CNBC on Thursday that state-owned enterprises have become \"emboldened\" by an environment that \"stresses politics above everything else\" in the last five years.\n\n\"They've been basically really taking on private companies in a very negative way,\" he added, citing anecdotal examples of the latter either being forced out of business by state rivals or seeking investment from them to stay in business.", "DowDuPont's highly anticipated split into three companies, set to occur in 2019, will generate nearly $1 billion in research and development funding, DowDuPont chief Ed Breen told CNBC on Thursday.\n\n\"The beauty of redoing the portfolio \u2014 and I'll use DuPont as the example \u2014 [is] we're going to spend almost $1 billion on R&D per year, so it's at a rate that's very healthy compared to the competitive peer set,\" Breen told Jim Cramer in an interview.\n\nDuPont, where Breen will stay on as a full-time executive chairman, will become a standalone specialty company focused in various secular markets including transportation, electronics and nutrition.\n\n\"What happened is you're bringing R&D in from the Dow businesses that came in and the DuPont [businesses],\" Breen said on \"Mad Money.\" \"You're bringing that R&D into the same end market opportunities, like in nutrition and health. We both had nutrition and health companies, and now you're bringing double the R&D to bear on that industry.\"\n\nBreen, who is known for successfully engineering a decade-long, five-way split of former monolith Tyco, said that DuPont represents the \"fast-growth\" portion of the spin-off involved in \"secular growth\" areas of the market.\n\n\"That's where we put our science and research. So for instance, in the auto industry, we're the ones electrifying the cars, which is the wave. We're also the company lightweighting vehicles, which is a huge trend that's going to continue,\" he said.\n\nHe added that these end markets explain how DuPont's business grew 10 percent in a period of declining auto sales.\n\n\"You've got to be in the right secular areas and that's where we are really diverting our R&D and innovation machine so we're in the high, fast-growth areas over the next five to 10 years,\" the CEO said.\n\nBreen added that DowDuPont's three-way split would bring \"three world-leading companies in their respective industries\" to the market. He said they would be \"shareholder-friendly\" when it came to dividends, and forecast share buybacks at all three entities \"as soon as\" the split is completed.\n\nDowDuPont's stock slid 0.65 percent in Thursday's trading session, settling at $59.44 a share. The stock dipped slightly in extended trading.", "Panicked selling in the month of October set some stocks up for victory in November, CNBC's Jim Cramer argued Thursday.\n\n\"The single best thing that happened to stocks in November was the hideous bruising that we got in the month of October,\" he said on \"Mad Money.\" \"Bizarrely enough, the newfound sense of fear and negativity created by the October meltdown is the best thing that could've happened to this market, because it gives stocks the breathing room that they need to roar higher again.\"\n\nThe major averages pared their gains in Thursday's trading session after the Federal Reserve announced it would leave interest rates unchanged. On Wednesday, much of the market rallied on the heels of Tuesday's election results, in which the Democratic Party regained control of the House of Representatives and Republicans maintained Senate control.\n\n\"After yesterday's 500-point Dow rally, I see a market that suddenly is beginning to make some sense,\" Cramer said. \"If you're a bull, you need a day like today that consolidates and cements yesterday's move.\"\n\nCramer said that three companies encapsulated why October was so good for stocks: Apple, Amazon and Alphabet. Amazon and Alphabet issued their earnings reports in the final days of October, while Apple reported on Nov. 1.\n\nAmazon's third-quarter report showed earnings that nearly doubled analysts' estimates, but just missed revenue estimates. Paired with a weaker-than-expected forecast, the results took Amazon's stock down 10 percent. To Cramer's surprise, the analyst community then added on to Amazon's pain with a wave of price target cuts and stock downgrades.\n\nAlphabet's stock saw a similar fate. After its third-quarter earnings report topped earnings estimates but missed on revenue, analysts slashed their price targets for the Google parent's shares and \"sentenced [it] to die,\" Cramer said.\n\nAs for Apple, which delivered fourth-quarter earnings and revenues above Wall Street estimates, analysts raised concerns about the iPhone maker's new earnings structure, which will not break down individual results for Apple's products. Again, the consumer products giant's stock was peppered with price target cuts and downgrades.\n\n\"What did the negativity accomplish besides getting you out at the bottom? Well, it reset expectations,\" Cramer explained. \"In other words, the newfound pessimism has finally lowered the bar enough that the risk has been seriously diminished by the widespread feeling of despair\" in all three sliding stocks.\n\nThose muted expectations could set the entire stock market up for success as the lucrative holiday season approaches and investors move past the latest Fed meeting and the midterm election, the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\n\"We have expectations that are now lowered to the point [where,] for most stocks, anything good could cause them to fly,\" he said. \"I think it's entirely possible that, with a few more placid days like this one, we could get sideline money to come back in, as the calendar and stock cupboard are bare and maybe it's time to get long.\"", "", "Prince Harry certainly has the riches of a royal, but there is one relatable, money-saving habit that he says he's obsessed with: making sure he doesn't have too many lights on at home.\n\nOf course, Prince Harry does it for other reasons than saving money. Harry revealed the quirk is one he learned from his father, Prince Charles, who is well-known for being an advocate for sustainability and environmentalism.\n\n\"He's a stickler for turning lights off,\" Harry says of his father Prince Charles in the new BBC One documentary, \"Prince, Son and Heir: Charles at 70,\" People reports. \"And that's now something that I'm obsessed with as well.\"\n\n\"I know, I've got serious OCD on light switches now, which is terrible,\" adds Prince William.\n\nAs a newlywed, Harry acknowledges that even his wife Meghan Markle has commented on the habit.\n\n\"My wife certainly goes, 'Well, why turn the lights off? You know, it's dark.' I go, 'We only need one light, we don't need like six,\" Harry says in the documentary.\n\n\"And all of a sudden it becomes a habit and those small habit changes he's making, every single person can do,\" Harry continues. \"And I think it's one of the key lessons that he taught us.\"\n\nPrince Charles and his sons aren't the only energy-savers in the royal family. In the past, it was reported that the Queen had posted warnings signs around the palace that read, \"The attention is drawn of all members of staff to the need to switch off unwanted lights. By Order of The Master of The Household.\" Sometimes, she even reportedly roamed the expansive hall's of the palace, flicking the lights off herself.\n\nTurning off the lights at home is not only good for the environment, it won't hurt your wallet either. The British royal family has been estimated to be worth around $95 billion, but they are still known to pinch pennies when they can, such as buying IKEA, eating leftovers and Prince George wearing his father's hand-me-downs.\n\nDon't miss: Prince Harry reportedly drove this car and now it's for sale on Autotrader for $93,000\n\nLike this story?

The bank said the U.S. government notified the bank on Oct. 11 that the judge in Manafort's case had signed off on the forfeiture of the property the day before.\n\nOn Thursday, the judge, Amy Berman Jackson, told prosecutors in special counsel Robert Mueller's office to answer the bank's filing by Nov. 21.\n\nIf UBS prevails in its request, the government could be forced to give the bank its share of the proceeds of any sale of the Trump Tower property.\n\nUBS did not say in its filing when Manafort fell into default on the mortgage or how much the condo is believed to currently be worth.\n\nA spokesman for Mueller declined to comment, as did Manafort's spokesman, Jason Maloni. Lawyers for UBS and Manafort did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nManafort, 69, pleaded guilty on Sept. 14 in Washington court to conspiracy charges related to income he earned from consulting work on behalf of pro-Russia politicians in Ukraine.\n\nThe plea came a month after he was convicted at trial in a related case in Virginia federal court. Both cases were being prosecuted by Mueller's office.\n\nAs part of his guilty plea, made right before he was due to face a second trial in Washington, Manafort agreed to forfeit an estimated $46 million worth of assets and cash.\n\nThe assets Manafort originally agreed to surrender included his home in Arlington, Virginia; a condo in lower Manhattan; a townhouse in Brooklyn, New York; and a house in the Hamptons section of Long Island, New York, as well as four bank accounts.\n\nManafort soon afterward told prosecutors he would give up another lower Manhattan property instead of his Virginia home. And he said he would give up his Trump Tower condo instead of one of the bank accounts.\n\nIn its court filing, UBS said it holds a mortgage for the Trump Tower property that Manafort and his wife, Kathleen, granted in April 2015.\n\nThe mortgage was granted in exchange for a variable-interest, 25-year loan in the original amount of $3 million, according to the bank. Manafort and his wife originally were paying an interest rate of just 2.055 percent per year.\n\nUnder the terms of the loan, the Manaforts were only obligated to pay interest \u2014 and not any principal \u2014 until April 2025. After that, the couple is required to pay principal and interest on the loan through May 2040.\n\n\"The Mortgage and Note are in default,\" UBS said in its filing. The bank said that in addition to the principal balance of $3 million, the Manaforts owe interest in the amount of $108,437.49, late fees of $4,848.75, other fees totaling $995, as well as unspecified attorneys' fees.\n\nAs of this month, the interest rate on the note is 4.125 percent, or daily interest of $343.75.", "Retail's dilemma: 3 trades\n\n6:02 PM ET Thu, 8 Nov 2018\n\nThe \"Fast Money\" traders give you 3 ways to trade retail ahead of the big black Friday deals.", "Media mogul Tom Roger's says there's one big reason Disney is in trouble\n\n5:55 PM ET Thu, 8 Nov 2018\n\nTom Rogers, Winview executive chairman, discusses his take on Disney earnings.", "The Trump administration moved in September 2017 to phase out the DACA program that shields Dreamers from deportation and gives them work permits.

California alone has about 200,000 Dreamers.\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that Obama exceeded his constitutional powers when he bypassed Congress and created the program. Back in January, the district judge had ordered the federal government to continue processing renewals of existing DACA applications while litigation over the legality of Trump's action was resolved.\n\nAfter the January ruling, President Donald Trump called the court system \"broken and unfair.\"\n\n\"When President Trump announced the rescission of the DACA program, we knew right away that we needed to take legal action here in California,\" said Becerra. \"We are home to one of every four Dreamers in this country.\"\n\nOn Monday, the administration urged the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the DACA case, a move that came before the 9th Circuit handed down its ruling.

Some of the candidates have included leaders in health consulting, hospital management and insurance. The position would report to Dean, but would also work closely with Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\n\nFeinberg's job will be figuring out how to organize Google's fragmented health initiatives, which overlap among many different business groups.\n\nAmong the groups interested in health care are Google's core search team, its cloud business, the Google Brain artificial intelligence team (one of several groups at Alphabet working on AI), the Nest home automation group and the Google Fit wearables team.\n\nOne particular area of interest is building out a health team within Nest to help manage users' health at home, as well as to monitor seniors who are choosing to live independently.

Whitaker, who was Attorney General Jeff Sessions' chief of staff, got the promotion after Trump fired Sessions a day earlier.\n\nWhitaker, in a joint statement with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, said \"Our asylum system is overwhelmed with too many meritless asylum claims from aliens who place a tremendous burden on our resources, preventing us from being able to expeditiously grant asylum to those who truly deserve it. Today, we are using the authority granted to us by Congress to bar aliens who violate a Presidential suspension of entry or other restriction from asylum eligibility.\"\n\nEarlier Thursday, NBC News reported that the administration expects to be sued over the new immigration policy. But two senior administration officials told the outlet that they expected the U.S. Supreme Court, emboldened by a 5-4 conservative majority, to ultimately uphold the plan.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, the most recent addition to the high court and Trump's second pick, is expected to side with the four other conservative justices and defer to the president's executive authority, the officials told NBC.\n\nThe harsher asylum measures come two days after the midterm elections, where Trump made immigration the keystone issue of his appeal for voters to elect Republicans. The GOP lost its majority control of the House to the Democrats in the midterms but gained seats in the Senate, which it already controlled.\n\nAt rallies, on social media and from the White House, Trump zeroed in on caravans of Central American migrants traveling toward the U.S.-Mexico border to seek asylum, claiming they were an \"invasion\" of the country. Trump said he was willing to send as many as 15,000 troops to defend the border, even though the caravans remained hundreds of miles away from the U.S. come Election Day.\n\nThe rule announced Thursday is not the first time the Trump administration has sidestepped Congress to unilaterally shift the nation's immigration policy.\n\nIn his first days in office, Trump signed an executive order limiting travel to the U.S. from a number of majority Muslim countries. The travel ban was stalled in court for months, but the Supreme Court ultimately upheld a version of the ban in a landmark ruling earlier this year that fell along partisan lines.\n\nOver the summer, Sessions implemented his \"zero tolerance\" policy toward illegal border crossings. The spike in prosecutions also led to the mass separation of families, which set off a wave of bipartisan criticism resulting in Trump effectively nullifying the policy by executive order in June.\n\nThe president has also used his executive power to hamstring the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, an Obama-era program that allows undocumented immigrants who arrived as young children to remain in the country and obtain work permits.\n\nThe president's termination of DACA has been blocked by courts in Washington and New York. On Thursday, a federal appeals court weighed in, largely echoing previous court rulings and upholding a nationwide ban on the president's order. That ruling makes it virtually certain that the fate of DACA will be decided by the Supreme Court in the coming months.\n\nRead the full release below. The interim final rule can be found here.\n\nWASHINGTON\u2014Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen today announced an Interim Final Rule declaring that those aliens who contravene a presidential suspension or limitation on entry into the United States through the southern border with Mexico issued under section 212(f) or 215(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) will be rendered ineligible for asylum.\n\n\n\nThe Acting Attorney General and the Secretary issued the following joint statement:\n\n\n\n\"Consistent with our immigration laws, the President has the broad authority to suspend or restrict the entry of aliens into the United States if he determines it to be in the national interest to do so. Today's rule applies this important principle to aliens who violate such a suspension or restriction regarding the southern border imposed by the President by invoking an express authority provided by Congress to restrict eligibility for asylum. Our asylum system is overwhelmed with too many meritless asylum claims from aliens who place a tremendous burden on our resources, preventing us from being able to expeditiously grant asylum to those who truly deserve it. Today, we are using the authority granted to us by Congress to bar aliens who violate a Presidential suspension of entry or other restriction from asylum eligibility.\"\n\n\n\nSection 212(f) of the Immigration and INA states that \"[w]henever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\"\n\n\n\nFurther, Section 215(a) of the INA states that it is \"unlawful\u2026for any alien to depart from or enter or attempt to depart from or enter the United States except under such reasonable rules, regulations, and orders, and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the President may prescribe.\"\n\n\n\nIn Section 208(d)(5)(B) of the INA, Congress specified that the Attorney General \"may provide by regulation for any other conditions or limitations on the consideration of an application for asylum.\"\n\n\n\nToday's new rule applies to prospective presidential proclamations, and is not retroactive.\n\n\n\nAsylum is a discretionary form of relief granted by the Executive Branch on a discretionary basis to those fleeing persecution on the basis of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The rule does not render such aliens ineligible for withholding of removal under the INA or protection from removal under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\n\nWATCH:Here are the businesses profiting from immigration enforcement", "bad url", "The American consumer, who is enjoying low unemployment and high confidence, has \"the best backdrop we've seen in decades\" for the holiday shopping season, J.P.

It's been a key theme on a number of the different, more recent conference calls.\"\n\nYet, Boss said, pricing power is still in play as prices, wages and transportation costs continue to rise. This creates an opportunity for off-price retailers, such as TJX Companies and Ross Stores, and discounters, such as Dollar General and Five Below, he said.\n\nFurthermore, the retail industry continues to face disruption as consumers have \"so many more choices today.\" Boss predicted that more closures and bankruptcies are still to come and that off-price retailers stand to benefit.\n\n\"That also leads you back to those off-price retailers, which I'll even include Ollie's in there,\" he said. \"It also points you back to the discounters.\"\n\n\u2014 Reuters contributed to this report.\n\nDisclaimer", "Shares of Yelp tanked after the company's third quarter earnings report and guidance disappointed on Thursday.\n\nThe stock was down by 30 percent in premarket trading Friday.\n\nThe company reported revenue of $241 million for the quarter, just shy of analyst projections of $245 million.

He said the acquisition of Fox assets gives Disney rights to valuable intellectual property as well as a greater pool of talent, particularly in television.\n\n\"We aim to use the television production capabilities of the combined company to fuel Hulu with a lot more original programming, original programming that we feel will enable Hulu to compete even more aggressively in the marketplace,\" Iger said.\n\nHulu already has an advantage when it comes to demographics, Iger said. When you compare the demographics on Hulu with that of viewers of the same shows on traditional network television, Iger claimed that Hulu's audience can sometimes be 20 years younger.\n\n\"That's clearly attractive to advertisers, which I think has been somewhat underappreciated about Hulu in that it is a very strong play for advertisers because it can offer targeted ads and it has great demos and it's just a great user experience,\" he said.\n\nDisney has been experimenting with over-the-top video offerings, as it works to adjust to changing consumer behavior. In April, Disney launched ESPN+ and surprised analysts by notching more than 1 million paid subscribers in just five months.\n\nThe company also said it was taking a $157 million write-down on its investment in Vice Media.\n\nDisney shares have gained 7 percent so far this year, hitting a 52-week intraday high of $119.69 on Oct. 22.\n\nDisclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.

Facebook defines terrorist content as posts that praise, endorse or represent ISIS, al-Qaeda and their affiliate groups.\n\nThe removal of the terrorist content is part of an on-going effort by Facebook to rid its service of harmful content, which also includes misinformation, propaganda and spam.\n\nFacebook said, \"We measure how many pieces of content (such as posts, images, videos or comments) we took action on because they went against our standards for terrorist propaganda, specifically related to ISIS, al-Qaeda and their affiliates.\"\n\nThe company said it removed 9.4 million pieces of terrorist content during the second quarter and another 3 million posts during the third quarter. By comparison, the company in May announced that it removed 1.9 million posts during the first quarter of 2018.\n\n\"Terrorists are always looking to circumvent our detection and we need to counter such attacks with improvements in technology, training, and process,\" the company said in a blog post. \"These technologies improve and get better over time, but during their initial implementation such improvements may not function as quickly as they will at maturity.\"\n\nA lot of the material removed was old. But Facebook said it removed 2.2 million brand new terrorist posts in the second quarter and 2.3 million in the third quarter, up from 1.2 million in the first quarter.\n\nFacebook explained that it has focused its efforts on removing terrorist content before it is viewed by a wide audience. With that focus in mind, Facebook has reduced the median time between when a user first reports a terrorist post to when Facebook takes it down. That median time was 43 hours in the first quarter, but fell to 22 hours in the second quarter and 18 hours in the third quarter.\n\nThe company said it has relied on machine learning technology to detect terrorist content. In most cases, that terrorist content is reviewed and removed by trained humans, but the machine learning technology can remove content on its own if its \"confidence level is high enough that its 'decision' indicates it will be more accurate than our human reviewers,\" the company said.", "Gabelli: Disney can go to $200 in two years 2:15 PM ET Thu, 8 Nov 2018 | 06:45\n\nBillionaire value investor Mario Gabelli said on Thursday's \"Halftime Report\" that investors should be buying shares of Walt Disney, as he believes the stock could climb to $200 per share in two years.\n\nThe longtime investor is a Disney shareholder and explained that the company has a combination of strong earnings growth, minor capital expenditures, and an attractive multiple that will push the stock higher.\n\nDisney's stock price has increased slightly over the course of 2018, primarily due to investor focus on the company's new online streaming media service and the acquisition of assets from Fox.\n\nOn Tuesday, Disney's $71.3 billion offer to buy Twenty-First Century Fox's entertainment assets won approval from the European Commission, subject to Disney selling interests in factual TV channels in Europe.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is expected to post fourth quarter results after the close Thursday. Analysts are expecting a 25 percent year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS to $1.34, with revenue growing by 7.5 percent to $13.73 billion, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nDisney has beaten analyst expectations in 5 of its most recent 8 quarters.\n\nThat said, Disney's cable segment has suffered lackluster results for the past three years, in part to increasing cord-cutting among viewers, and any updates on the company's streaming strategy will be at the top of investors' minds.", "Sears Holdings said Thursday it plans to close 40 more stores early next year as it continues to slim its business and seeks to stymie losses under bankruptcy protection.\n\nThe retailer filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 15 with roughly 700 Sears and Kmart stores in operation. It announced at the time it would be closing 142 unprofitable stores and warned more closures could follow.\n\nThe additional store closures come as Sears is still looking to formally secure the money it needs to stay in operation long enough until it can find a potential buyer to avoid liquidation. It had interim approval for $300 million in emergency financing and was in talks with hedge fund ESL Investments for another $300 million loan, according to bankruptcy filings.\n\nTalks with ESL though, stalled, after disagreements about who had first claim on some of Sears' few remaining assets, people familiar with the matter have told CNBC.

At the time, he also called for a 10 percent correction during the year.\n\nIn fact, there were brief corrections in February and again in October, which saw the S&P 500 plunge nearly 7 percent for the month. But so far in November, as of Wednesday's close, the index made back more than half that slide.\n\n\"We got undervalued in the correction [in] October,\" said Wien, who joined Blackstone in 2009 after nearly 23 years as chief U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley.\n\nGoing forward, the stock market's gains depend on strong earnings, he said. \"Earnings next year are going to be good, too. They won't be up 20 [percent], but they may be up 10 [percent].\"\n\n\"In an environment where earnings are increasing 10 percent, the market is not overvalued as long as interest rates don't go up too much,\" he concluded.\n\nThe last record close on the S&P 500 came on Sept. 20, when the index finished at 2,930.75.", "Netflix and Warner Bros. are feeling the wrath of satanists.\n\nThe Satanic Temple is suing Netflix and Warner Brothers for $150 million, saying the companies infringed on its copyrights, violated its trademark, and caused injury to its business reputation, according to court documents filed on Thursday in a New York district court.\n\nAt the center of the controversy is Baphomet, described in the court documents as \"an androgynous goat-headed deity.\" A statue of the satanic god surrounded by children is featured in the Netflix series \"The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.\"\n\nHowever, the lawsuit claims the show's statue is similar to The Satanic Temple's real-life Baphomet monument, which was made famous by an Indiegogo campaign in 2014. Although it was intended to be installed next to the Ten Commandments at the Oklahoma State Capitol, it now resides in Detroit after multiple protests. The Baphomet statue has since become \"a central icon that has come to represent us [satanists] as a people,\" explained The Satanic Temple co-founder Lucien Greaves.\n\n\"To have that all at once entirely eclipsed by some Netflix show by a production department who did a Google Image Search... A lot of people who haven't heard of us first stand to just recognize that monument as the 'Sabrina' monument, which dilutes and denigrates the entire project,\" he said.\n\nBecause the statue is featured prominently in the show, The Satanic Temple claims its members are being associated with the \"evil antagonists\" depicted in the series. The characters of the show, who worship the \"Dark Lord\" or Satan, engage in cannibalism, necromancy, murder and torture, among other nefarious activities.\n\nThe Satanic Temple, on the other hand, \"does not promote evil and instead holds to the basic principle that undue suffering is bad, and that which reduces suffering is good,\" the organization claims. It hails Satan as a \"rebel against God's authority, rather than an evil being.\"\n\nThe religious group reached out to Netflix and Warner Bros. to remove the depiction when it became aware of the statue in the series, but its request went unanswered.\n\n\"It does really kind of normalize this notion that the only true meaning of this type of religious identification is one that can be associated with a patriarchal, cannibalistic cult,\" Greaves said. \"We're so inundated with this anti-Satan fiction that a lot of people think its superfluous to pursue to a claim like this at all.\"\n\nNetflix and Warner Bros. declined to comment, citing pending litigation.\n\nWATCH:Netflix crushed earnings \u2014 Watch five experts break down what happens next for the stock", "Saudi government-tied think tank launches study on OPEC breakup: Dow Jones\n\n2:24 PM ET Thu, 8 Nov 2018\n\nCNBC's Jackie DeAngelis reports on a Dow Jones report that a Saudi government-tied think tank is launching a study on a possible OPEC break-up.", "A U.S. appeals court in California ruled on Thursday that President Donald Trump's administration must continue a program begun under former President Barack Obama that protects hundreds of thousands of immigrants who were brought into the country illegally as children.\n\nThe decision by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals preserves the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program introduced in 2012 that has shielded from deportation a group of immigrants dubbed \"Dreamers\" and has given them work permits, though not a path to citizenship.\n\nTrump has taken a stern stance against illegal immigration. His administration announced plans in September 2017 to phase out DACA, arguing that Obama exceeded his constitutional powers when he bypassed Congress and created the program. DACA offers protections to roughly 700,000 young adults, mostly Hispanics.\n\nThe three-judge panel rejected the administration's claim that the decision to end DACA was not reviewable by the courts.\n\n\"And, upon review, we conclude that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the rescission of DACA - at least as justified on this record - is arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\" Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw wrote.\n\nThe ruling represented another legal defeat for Trump concerning DACA, although he has won court victories on other parts of his tough immigration policies.\n\nOn Monday, the administration took the unusual step of asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case, which stems from a federal judge's January decision to block Trump from ending DACA, even though the appeals court had yet to rule.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday he saw potential to work with Democrats, who won control of the House of Representatives this week, but he would have to see how the Supreme Court rules on the issue.\n\nSan Francisco-based U.S. District Judge William Alsup decided in January the government must continue processing renewals of existing DACA applications while litigation over the legality of Trump's action is resolved. The administration in February unsuccessfully appealed Alsup's ruling to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe ruling stems from a lawsuit brought by the University of California, the states of California, Maine, Maryland and Minnesota and others challenging Trump's move to end DACA.\n\nTrump's move last year had called for the program to begin winding down this past March. Trump's action sparked an outcry from immigration advocates, business groups, colleges and some religious leaders. There are about 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nLawsuits both challenging and supporting Trump's decision to end DACA have been working their way through the courts, making it likely the issue will wind up in front of the Supreme Court.\n\nThe ruling by the 9th Circuit does not impact a nationwide injunction to preserve DACA issued by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn in February, which also has been appealed.\n\nIn addition, a federal judge in Washington in August ordered the administration to fully restore DACA, including taking new applications. That decision was stayed pending appeal.\n\nLegislation to extend protections for DACA recipients and provide them a path to citizenship failed in Congress this year.\n\nWATCH: Here are the businesses profiting from immigration enforcement", "Luxury car company Porsche, founded in 1948, made more than 4.22 billion euros in profit before taxes in 2017, according to its annual report.

Markets figured the central bank would hold the line at this meeting and probably approve a quarter-point hike in December, which would be the fourth of the year.\n\nThere were a few tweaks to the way policymakers are viewing economic conditions.\n\nOn the upside, the committee noted that the unemployment rate \"has declined\" since the September meeting. The Labor Department last week reported that the headline jobless level was at 3.7 percent, the lowest since December 1969.\n\nHowever, the statement noted that the \"growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year.\"\n\nThere was no detail or data given for why officials see investment declining, though companies reported during third-quarter earnings season that some of their investment plans have been curtailed due to the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China.\n\nThe economy otherwise has been humming along strongly, and the FOMC reiterated its belief that \"economic activity has been rising at a strong rate.\" GDP growth this year has averaged 3.3 percent for the first three quarters and is expected to come in around 3 percent for the final three-month period of 2018.\n\n\"We shouldn't be surprised by either comment as they are simply a summary of the recent data,\" Michelle Meyer, U.S. economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said in a note. \"Interestingly, there was no mention of the softer housing data. Moreover, there was no mention of the sell-off in the stock market in October which implies that Fed officials were largely willing to shrug it off.\"", "Google CEO Sundar Pichai offered a new justification for the company's exploration of a censored version of its search engine for people in China: it already censors information elsewhere.\n\nIn a New York Times interview published Thursday, Pichai compared Europe's \"right to be forgotten laws\" to censorship when asked about launching a search product in China.\n\n\"One of the things that's not well understood, I think, is that we operate in many countries where there is censorship. When we follow 'right to be forgotten' laws, we are censoring search results because we're complying with the law,\" Pichai told the Times.\n\nGoogle has been grappling with how it could reach China's 800 million Internet users since it withdrew its service in 2010 amid censorship and security concerns. Earlier this year, Google faced backlash both internally and from the public when the Intercept reported its apparent plans to build a censored version of its search engine in China.\n\nEurope's \"right to be forgotten\" laws are distinct in important ways from censorship of information by the Chinese government.\n\nWhile \"right to be forgotten\" laws mainly center on the right of individuals to request personal data be deleted from the internet or search results, the Chinese government has been found to suppress factual information that would not be subject to the \"right to be forgotten\" laws.\n\nThrough tight control over its media and internet access, China has created the \"Great Firewall\" that prevents people living there from accessing certain websites or searching some historical events, like the protests at Tiananmen Square in 1989.\n\nThe \"right to be forgotten\" came from a 2014 case decided against Google by the European Court of Justice. The case centered around a Spanish man who wanted Google to remove an old newspaper article about a real estate auction the government ordered to recover his social security debts. The court decided that Google had to remove the article from its index even though the newspaper could keep it on its site.\n\nNow, the \"right to be forgotten\" is codified in the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect earlier this year. Under this part of the regulation, EU citizens have the right to request that internet businesses delete certain personal data under some circumstances.\n\nPichai told the Times he's not convinced that a Chinese search engine would be Google's top priority.\n\n\"I'm committed to serving users in China,\" he said. \"Whatever form it takes, I actually don't know the answer. It's not even clear to me that search in China is the product we need to do today.\"\n\nA Google spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.", "Whitaker, 49, was named acting Attorney General after President Donald Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions just hours after the midterm elections.\n\nA former Iowa U.S. attorney during the George W. Bush administration, Whitaker ran for public office as a Republican and was the executive director for a conservative nonprofit before being tapped to join the Justice Department as Sessions' chief of staff in September 2017.\n\nOne month prior to taking the post at DOJ, Whitaker wrote an op-ed for CNN arguing that if Mueller \"were to continue to investigate the financial relationships without a broadened scope in his appointment, then this would raise serious concerns that the special counsel's investigation was a mere witch hunt.\"\n\nWhitaker was agreeing with the president, who had said a month before the op-ed was published that a special counsel investigation of the Trump family's finances would be \"a violation.\"\n\nThe piece reflected his prior comments as a pundit for the news network. In August 2017, Whitaker said on CNN that if the special counsel \"does go beyond the 2016 election and get into Trump Organization finances unrelated to the 2016 election, and really unrelated to Russian coordination if it even exists, I think that would be crossing a red line.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I think that's when the deputy attorney general ... needs to step in and pull the reins back on Bob Mueller if he starts to go outside of those bounds of his delegation of authority.\" The No. 2 DOJ official, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, had taken over for Sessions in overseeing the special counsel's probe.\n\nWhitaker also promoted an op-ed from former federal prosecutor George Parry, who argued in August 2017 that Trump's legal team should resist cooperating with the special counsel.\n\nLater that month, Whitaker in another appearance on CNN argued against accusations that Trump's hotel in Washington, D.C., presented a conflict of interest for the president.\n\nWhitaker also has close connections to Sam Clovis, a former Trump campaign aide who was reportedly questioned by Mueller. Whitaker chaired Clovis' Iowa State Treasurer campaign in 2014, and Clovis told Talking Points Memo on Wednesday that \"He and I are very good friends, very close friends, and I'm very happy for him.\"\n\nWhat's more, Whitaker appeared to defend Trump campaign officials' meeting with Kremlin-connected Russians at Trump Tower in June 2016.\n\n\"There is no federal crime of collusion. So we're either looking at espionage charges, which seems farcical with the evidence we have now, or we're looking at campaign finance violations, but I still don't see how there's anything of value there,\" Whitaker said.", "Google receives an average 1.1 million job applicants annually, according to LinkedIn, and regularly tops lists of today's most attractive employers.\n\nNot only do Google employees enjoy perks like espresso bars and dog parks, they also take home hefty salaries.

It was unclear Thursday whether the two leaders would meet face to face, with the Kremlin saying they would, and the White House denying that any meeting had been scheduled.\n\n\"The United States is leveraging new authorities to target Russian actors for serious human rights abuses in parts of Ukraine that the United States government has determined are forcibly occupied or otherwise controlled by the Russian government, and other reprehensible acts in furtherance of the Kremlin's malign agenda,\" said Sigal Mandelker, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence at the Treasury Department in a statement.\n\nRussia announced earlier this year that it would hold elections on Sunday in the two regions of Crimea in annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

Aero,\" a mid-sized sedan.\n\nThe Wolfsburg-based carmaker, which declined to comment on the plans, is also expected to discuss far-reaching alliances with battery cell manufacturer SK Innovation and rival Ford, the source said.\n\nVW's strategy shift comes as cities start to ban diesel engine vehicles, forcing carmakers to think of new ways to safeguard 600,000 German industrial jobs, of which 436,000 are at car companies and their suppliers.\n\nAn electric van, the ID Buzz, is due to be built at VW's plant in Hannover, where its T6 Van is made, the source said.\n\nTo free up production capacity for electric cars in Hannover, VW's transporter vans could be produced at a Ford plant in Turkey, the source added.\n\nExploratory talks\n\nVW and Ford are in \"exploratory talks\" to develop self-driving and electric vehicles in an alliance meant to save them billions of dollars, Reuters reported last month.\n\nGerman VW factories in Emden, Zwickau and Hanover, which all build combustion-engined cars, will switch to electric ones in under the plans being considered, the source said.\n\nCarmakers in Germany agreed on Thursday to spend up to 3,000 euros ($3,430) per vehicle to add more efficient exhaust filtering systems to cut diesel emissions, but failed to prevent bans on diesel vehicles by Cologne and Bonn.\n\nEU lawmakers have agreed to seek a 35 percent cut in car emissions by 2030 after a U.N. report called for dramatic steps to slow global warming.\n\nDiess said to cut average fleet emissions of carbon dioxide in Europe by 30 percent by 2030, VW needs to raise its share of fully electric vehicles to 30 percent of new car sales.\n\nThe shift from combustion engines to electric cars would also cost 14,000 jobs at VW by 2020 as it takes less time to build an electric car than a conventional one and because jobs will shift overseas to battery manufacturers.\n\nIn Europe there are about 126 plants making combustion engines, employing 112,000 people. The largest such plant in Europe is VW's in Kassel.\n\nWATCH: How automakers sell a $71,000 version of a $27,000 car", "Tesla's newly appointed chairwoman Robyn Denholm will bring business expertise to the helm of the company's board and serve as a crucial counterbalance to CEO Elon Musk, even if she isn't the most exciting pick, analysts and experts told CNBC Thursday.\n\nDenholm is the Chief Financial Officer at Australian telecom company Telstra, where she previously served as Chief Operations Officer. She announced Wednesday she was leaving the company and will focus solely on her role as Tesla's chair. Before Telstra, Denholm held executive positions with networking systems companies and served as a national finance manager for Toyota.\n\nDenholm has been on Tesla's board since 2014, which many said is the only real downside to the appointment. Investors and analysts were hoping for a truly independent, outside chairperson to fully check Musk's often wild antics.\n\nIt was Musk's controversial tweeting that spurred the SEC fraud charges and subsequent settlement that mandated a new chairperson in the first place.\n\n\"I could dream up 10 people from the outside that could be chairperson, but I don't really know, from an ivory tower, if that makes sense,\" Baird analyst Ben Kallo told CNBC. \"We all want a superstar \u2014 Larry Ellison at some point, or [Sheryl] Sandberg from Facebook \u2014 and as much as that sounds good on paper, in reality this is probably a smarter, more measured decision.\"\n\nDenholm is as independent as a current insider gets, Kallo said. Among a hand-picked board that includes Elon's brother Kimbal Musk, Denholm is relatively removed. She's also unlikely to make headlines like Musk often does.\n\n\"She's always been a voice of good logic and reason [on the board] and helped balance out... anyone that would just go with the flow with Elon,\" Kallo said. \"Can she check Elon? I'm not sure, and I'm not sure if anyone could check him. Maybe his brother, but I think if they had his brother as chairperson everyone would be up in arms.\"\n\nTesla still has two more independent directors to appoint in compliance with the SEC settlement. The selections could shed light on Denholm's immediate impact as chairwoman.\n\n\"I think what they have to demonstrate is there's a sort of new world order within Tesla \u2014 more stringent filters on corporate communications, more objective, well-rounded decisions around corporate governance,\" Consumer Edge Research analyst Jamie Albertine told CNBC. \"I just hope that they're aware of the gravity of the bigger looming question: the broader independence of the board of directors relative to management.\"", "Initiatives like raising the price of tobacco, educating consumers on the dangers of smoking and efforts to help people quit are the primary drivers behind the decline, said King. Fewer young people are starting to smoke, older smokers are dying and others are quitting, he said.\n\nWhen adding other categories, including e-cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, 19.3 percent of adults, or 47 million people, used tobacco products of some kind in 2017, according to the CDC. Cigars, cigarillos or filtered little cigars were the second-most used product behind cigarettes, with 3.8 percent of adults, or 9.3 million people, saying they used them.\n\nNearly 4 percent of adults use two or more tobacco products, with cigarettes and e-cigarettes representing the most common combination. It's unclear whether people are initially using both as part of the process to switch from cigarettes to e-cigarettes, but officials warn that people must fully switch in order to cut smoking risks.\n\nJuul, the most popular e-cigarette on the market, was created to help smokers switch from cigarettes. While some adults are using the Juul devices to do just that, anecdotal evidence suggests many teens are also using the devices. Preliminary federal data show a 77 percent surge in high school students using e-cigarettes, figures that have prompted the Food and Drug Administration to label this an \"epidemic.\"\n\nThe agency ordered five manufacturers \u2014 Juul, British American Tobacco's Vuse, Altria's MarkTen, Imperial Brands' Blu E-cigs and Japan Tobacco's Logic \u2014 to submit plans within 60 days on reducing teen use. The five companies represent about 97 percent of the e-cigarette market, according to the FDA.\n\nAmong adults, 2.8 percent used e-cigarettes last year, according to the CDC, down slightly from 3.2 percent in 2016. King cautions that this survey may not have captured how many adults are using Juul because the trend picked up in the later half of 2017 and the survey was conducted on a monthly basis.\n\nHe also worries that young adults are using these products more than older demographics even though they're less likely to smoke conventional cigarettes. For adults ages 18 to 24, 5.2 percent used e-cigarettes and 10.4 percent smoked cigarettes last year, according to the CDC.\n\n\"If e-cigarette use was responsible [for declines in cigarette use], you would expect to see a perfect correlation, but that's not what we're seeing,\" he said. \"If anything, e-cigarettes have complicated the tobacco product landscape.\"\n\nWATCH: How Juul made vaping cool and became a $15 billion e-cigarette giant", "Housing sentiment hits lowest level in a year\n\n12:57 PM ET Thu, 8 Nov 2018\n\nCNBC's Diana Olick reports on housing sentiment as the Federal Reserve signals it plans to hike interest rates again in December.", "Banks are stuck in a correction, but one name in the group could charge higher 3:55 PM ET Wed, 7 Nov 2018 | 03:31\n\nFinancials are lagging the market after falling nearly 10 percent from highs, while banks have tumbled 14 percent.\n\nMark Newton, president of Newton Advisors, is long-term bullish on financials but sees recent weakness as a reason for caution.\n\n\"I still believe that financials are trending higher, but we're really within a downtrend that began at the beginning of the year. So unfortunately even with rates moving higher the group has been under a lot of pressure, and you've really had to be a lot more selective,\" Newton said on CNBC's \"Trading Nation\" on Wednesday.\n\nNewton says avoiding regional brokers and other sector stocks that have been badly beaten and finding financials-adjacent picks in the tech space could be a sensible move.\n\n\"Visa is my pick in terms of within the whole financial space. Visa and Mastercard both look very attractive. I think those continue to do well,\" he said.\n\nVisa and Mastercard have both rallied this year. Visa is up 27 percent this year, and Mastercard has added 37 percent, while the XLK technology ETF to which they both belong has added 11 percent. The XLF financials ETF has dropped 2 percent.\n\nStacey Gilbert, head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna, says she is not a buyer of the financials sector given the headwinds that are anathema to banks: weak loan growth and a flattening yield spread.\n\nHowever, she does have one financials pick that she believes could weather any troubles facing the sector.\n\n\"It would be KeyCorp,\" Gilbert said on \"Trading Nation\" on Wednesday. \"Relative to peers, it does have loan growth, and that's one of the things that we think is obviously incredibly important for a bank. So, sector as a whole? No, we wouldn't own it. Is there a name that if you have to own it that we'd focus on? It would be Key.\"\n\nGilbert's Susquehanna colleague Jack Micenko has a buy rating on KeyCorp and a price target of $25, implying 33 percent upside from current levels.

And they didn't have to pay any fees or interest on the card, either.\n\nBy paying off the final $100,000 on their house in Noblesville, Indiana, with their Barclaycard Arrival Plus World Elite Mastercard, they were able to earn 200,000 points, which were worth $2,000 when used on travel. Then, by using their card to pay for a portion of what it cost to build a new patio and family room, they earned even more points.\n\nThe average cardholder would have a hard time doing exactly what they did.

This year, there were a lot more \"no's\" than typical, she said, perhaps due to this particular election's overwhelming controversy and high number of key races.\n\n\"When in doubt, many people vote 'no,'\" she said.\n\nMost rejected measures would have increased taxes. Corporations also fought to protect personal interests in some cases, Williamson said. For example, in Washington state, oil and gas companies successfully lobbied to prevent a carbon fee on the ballot from passing.\n\nBut it's worth noting that even if your state measures failed, experts say that the broader midterm results could influence changes to the federal tax code and other elements of your personal finances.\n\nHere's how some of the big tax issues fared, according to the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of Brookings and the Urban Institute.

About $3.8 million was raised in the third quarter alone by the Democrat, while Knight's campaign took in less than $460,000 in the period.\n\nThe 25th District, where Democrats hold a nearly 4-point edge in voter registration, stretches from northern Los Angeles County into a portion of eastern Ventura County.

Morgan named three public companies who are potential long-term winners in the emerging technology.\n\nThe firm predicted software companies will use blockchain in a similar way to how many currently claim the benefit of machine learning and artificial intelligence. But there are few that J.P. Morgan says will create \"material incremental growth opportunities\" from the technology.\n\n\"Investors should be looking to identify where the opportunity to replace a middleman is the biggest, or where trust is needed where none exists, or what companies are the best positioned to offer blockchain as a service,\" J.P. Morgan software equity research analyst Sterling Auty said in a note to clients Thursday.\n\nJ.P. Morgan's bets for that disruption are \"middleman displacement opportunities\" and \"Blockchain as a Service,\" which the firm calls \"BaaS.\" In the bank's coverage at least three names fit that criteria \u2014 Akamai, DocuSign and Ellie Mae.\n\nCloud service provider Akamai, rated \"overweight\" by J.P. Morgan, could leverage the \"BaaS\" approach.\n\n\"Rather than building from scratch we see customers looking to utilize a vendor like Akamai that offers its Blockchain capabilities as a service,\" Auty said. \"While there are a number of companies that have blockchain technology, IBM as one example, we believe the sizeable Akamai network is an inherent advantage in running a distributed ledger in blockchain.\"\n\nIn this case, J.P. Morgan is advocating for use of closed, permissioned blockchain, also known as just \"private.\" Bitcoin by comparison, is the biggest \"public\" blockchain meaning anyone can join or participate in that network. Its \"distributed ledger,\" where transactions are recorded can also be seen by just about anyone.\n\nDocuSign already offers the ability to connect a blockchain network to its systems. The company, which J.P. Morgan also rated \"overweight,\" could leverage both private and public blockchains.\n\n\"DocuSign wants to be the platform to enable the entire contracting process in a digital manner. Over time we could see much of the platform being based on blockchain, basically shifting its\n\ncentralized security model for the distributed model of blockchain,\" J.P.

Pichai's memo says that while Google \"never required confidentiality,\" employees with harassment or assault claims can now choose whether or not to go through the arbitration process.\n\nOrganizers of Google's protests were also deliberate about including contract workers in their original demands. Google said in an additional document detailing changes that it will routinely review contractor and temp worker suppliers to see if they adhere to agreements around the handling of employee complaints. However, the Tech Workers Coalition, which launched a retaliation hotline for Google employees who participated in last week's protest, says that the new policies don't do enough to protect those temp, vendor and contract workers (TVCs).\n\n\"TVCs didn't receive this email this morning, and have been excluded from the town-hall,\" a spokesperson said. \"This deliberate slight demonstrates the caste-like system deployed by Google, which fails to protect its workers and our colleagues.\"\n\nBloomberg reported that during the first quarter of the year Alphabet had more TVCs than direct employees (of which it had 85,050 at the time).

As CEO, I take this responsibility very seriously and I'm committed to making the changes we need to improve. Over the past few weeks Google's leaders and I have heard your feedback and have been moved by the stories you've shared. We recognize that we have not always gotten everything right in the past and we are sincerely sorry for that. It's clear we need to make some changes. Going forward, we will provide more transparency on how we handle concerns. We'll give better support and care to the people who raise them. And we will double down on our commitment to be a representative, equitable, and respectful workplace. Today, we're announcing a comprehensive action plan to make progress. It's detailed hereand I encourage everyone to read it. Here are some of the key changes: We will make arbitration optional for individual sexual harassment and sexual assault claims. Google has never required confidentiality in the arbitration process and arbitration still may be the best path for a number of reasons (e.g. personal privacy) but, we recognize that choice should be up to you.\n\n\n\nWe will provide more granularity around sexual harassment investigations and outcomes at the company as part of our Investigations Report.\n\n\n\nWe're revamping the way we handle and look into your concerns in three ways: We're overhauling our reporting channels by bringing them together on one dedicated site and including live support. We will enhance the processes we use to handle concerns\u2014including the ability for Googlers to be accompanied by a support person. And we will offer extra care and resources for Googlers during and after the process. This includes extended counseling and career support,\n\n\n\nWe will update and expand our mandatory sexual harassment training. From now on if you don't complete your training, you'll receive a one-rating dock in Perf.\n\n\n\nWe will recommit to our company-wide OKR around diversity, equity and inclusion again in 2019, focused on improving representation\u2014through hiring, progression and retention\u2014and creating a more inclusive culture for everyone. Our Chief Diversity Officer will continue to provide monthly progress updates to me and my leadership team. I hope you'll take the time to read the full range of actions we're announcing today. Thank you all for the feedback you've shared with us. This is an area where we need to continually make progress and are committed to doing so. We often hear from Googlers that the best part of working here is other Googlers. Even in difficult times, we are encouraged by the commitment of our colleagues to create a better workplace. That's come through very strongly over the past few weeks. -Sundar\n\nGoogle also expanded on Pichai's note with more details about the changes:", "The Federal Reserve could make no new comment at all after its meeting and still sound hawkish, sending the bond market into a tizzy.\n\n\"If the Fed reaffirms that it's going to keep going after all that stock market noise in October, people may say, 'Hmm, we didn't really expect that,'\" said Michael Schumacher, director rate strategy at Wells Fargo.\n\nBond strategists mostly expect the Fed to sound just like it did after its last meeting,ready to roll with its rate-hiking plans, when it issues its post-meeting statement at 2 p.m. That means another rate hike would be coming in December and the Fed sticks with its forecast for three more next year.\n\n\"I think the front end of the market will sell off and the long end will stay stable,\" said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO.\n\nA nod by the Fed to recent market volatility would be seen as dovish and be interpreted as a sign of caution, suggesting the Fed might be less willing to proceed with as many interest rate hikes as it has forecast. Many Fed watchers expect fewer rate hikes next year than the Fed has forecast.\n\nBut Lyngen said the Fed is not likely to mention recent volatile markets, and that could be taken as hawkish. The S&P 500 was down about 7 percent in October.\n\nThe 2-year Treasury yield, at the front end of the curve, is most reflective of Fed interest rate policy. That 2-year note was yielding 2.94 percent Thursday, after reaching a more than decade high of 2.96 percent after the election Tuesday evening. Lyngen said that yield could easily touch 3 percent in the near future and at least reach a new cycle high after the Fed meeting.\n\nThe 10-year note, at 3.21 percent Thursday, is expected to make a more muted move. That would mean the curve, or spread between yields, would be 'flattening' as the long end yield and short end yields move closer together. The benchmark 10-year is tied to a wide range of business and consumer loans, including home mortgages.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's rate-hiking policy has been driving a flatter curve. But there is concern in the market as it continues to narrow because a truly flat curve leads to inversion, meaning short end rates rise above long end rates. That phenomena has been a reliable signal for oncoming recessions.\n\nThe Fed on Thursday is expected to leave the fed funds rate range at its current 2 to 2.25 percent level, but raise it when it meets in December by a quarter point.\n\nThere was some speculation the Fed could make a technical tweak to the interest rate on excess reserves as it did earlier this year, but that is mostly seen as unlikely for the November meeting since there is no press briefing.\n\nWATCH: Five market experts break down how to invest as interest rates spike", "If you expect to welcome a new baby to the family in 2019, cast a critical eye to your health benefits this fall.\n\nIt's open enrollment season, a time when many Americans sign up for a health plan for the coming year, including those through an employer or on government exchanges.\n\nPlenty make those decisions on autopilot: Ninety-three percent of employees choose the same benefits each year, and 56 percent spend less than 30 minutes researching their options, according to a report from Aflac.\n\n\"Most of the time we don't think about our health care until we have some medical event,\" said Jody Dietel, chief compliance officer for benefits administrator WageWorks.\n\nYet pregnancy is one of the rare opportunities where you can anticipate a major medical event (in this case, giving birth), and plan around the expenses related to it, she said.\n\n\"It's important that people spend the time to understand their benefits,\" Dietel said.\n\nAnd open enrollment is the time to think about that coverage, whether you're currently pregnant or plan to be next year.

Becoming pregnant typically isn't a so-called \"qualifying life event\" that lets you change or enroll in coverage mid-year, said Cheryl Fish-Parcham, director of access initiatives for Families USA, a health-care advocacy group.\n\n(Having a baby is considered a qualifying life event, with coverage retroactive to the date of birth. But that special enrollment is generally limited to obtaining coverage for that child by adding them to your plan or purchasing a new plan exclusively for them \u2014 not changing coverage for current family members.)\n\nMore from Personal Finance:\n\nRetirement on a Caribbean island can cost as little as $24,000 a year\n\nIf you're planning to retire in 2019, here's how to make sure you're prepared\n\nFinancial planning as easy as booking a hotel room? Consumers say, 'Yes, please'\n\nFor consumers buying a plan on the open market, missing the open enrollment window may mean they can't get a plan with decent maternity coverage, Fish-Parcham said.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, maternity care and childbirth are considered essential health benefits that all qualified plans must cover. But short-term health insurance policies, which are available year-round, don't fall under ACA regulations \u2014 and so may exclude or limit maternity coverage, she said.\n\nHere's what an expecting parent should look for during open enrollment:", "The average cost of a wedding in the United States is at least $33,000, according to XO Group. That total includes everything from venue costs to food and alcohol, entertainment and the bride's dress.\n\nFor that reason, you need to start saving now, says Sethi.\n\nFactoring in the age at which people tend to get married, as well as your own income and ability to save money, you should be able to come up with an idea of how much to start putting aside immediately to finance your dream wedding down the road.\n\nAnd don't feel like you need to wait until you're engaged, or even in a relationship, to start saving, Sethi says. While some people might feel awkward saving for a wedding so prematurely, Sethi feels the opposite way.\n\n\"I think it's weird to not save and to wait until you're 28 [or] 30, and suddenly you say: 'My god, where is this money coming from?'\" he says.\n\nSethi, who is 36, got married in July. He'd actually been saving for his wedding since he was 24 years old, several years before he even met his wife, he tells CNBC Make It.\n\nLong before he was ready to get married, Sethi says, he knew two things for sure: \"I knew, one, that I was probably going to get married eventually. Two, I knew that it was going to be a lot more than $30,000, because I'm Indian.\" (Indian weddings are notoriously extravagant and, even in the US, they cost roughly $65,000 on average, according to one estimate.)\n\n\"So, I started saving money every single month in a savings account \u2014 I literally called it 'Wedding Savings' \u2014 every month I would put money [in] there automatically.\"\n\nOver the years, Sethi kept putting money into the savings account, while keeping a separate allotment within that account for an engagement ring, he says. When it came time for him to propose to his then-girlfriend, he was able to start budgeting the eventual wedding costs. (Sethi has said previously that you can ignore the old rule of spending two months' salary on an engagement ring. In reality, you should make a budget that makes more sense for you.)", "The number of \"fake news\" accounts was significantly higher in this year's midterm elections than in the 2016 presidential election and it's only set to grow by 2020, according to the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) top software engineer.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC at the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon, Portugal on Thursday, DNC Chief Technology Officer Raffi Krikorian said his team was in \"constant communication\" with social media companies during Tuesday's elections to report fake accounts. He said misinformation campaigns are growing in size and sophistication.

Companies are barred from buying back their own stock in a window around their earnings releases. Buybacks have been a driving force behind this bull market with companies even issuing debt at low interest rates to repurchase their own stock.\n\nOther data support J.P. Morgan's numbers. In the past four weeks as earnings announcements wound down, buybacks have averaged $3.3 billion daily, with the number of announcements running at the fastest pace in the past three years, according to TrimTabs Investment Research data from Wednesday.\n\nOverall, Goldman Sachs notes that buybacks for companies in the S&P 500 jumped by 51 percent in the first half of the year as companies spent the money from the tax cut, especially the funds that were trapped overseas. Goldman Sachs expects S&P 500 share repurchases to climb another 22 percent to $940 billion next year.\n\nThe recent buying has been fairly concentrated, with buybacks for Wells Fargo ($18.1 billion) and Merck ($10 billion) accounting for a combined 43 percent of the volume, the site said in a press release.

The federal gas tax has been 18.4 cents, 24.4 cents for diesel, since it was last raised in 1993.\n\n\"If you raise the gas tax 10 cents a gallon, you get billions of dollars. That's a very, very good start,\" said LaHood, currently co-chairman of the Building America's Future coalition, which pushes for a new era in infrastructure investment. \"It sends a message to the states that the federal government is serious about getting back into being a good partner.\"\n\n\"We need to start somewhere,\" he added. \"You know America is one big pothole.\"\n\nBack in February, there were reports that Trump was signaling a willingness to consider a federal gas tax hike to bolster the cash-strapped Highway Trust Fund. The president's possible flexibility on the matter came shortly after the White House unveiled its long-promised infrastructure plan, which eventually went nowhere.\n\nThe administration at the time proposed a $1.5 trillion plan to fix the nation's aging infrastructure by putting up $200 billion in federal funding over 10 years. The proposal capped federal funding at 20 percent for any given project, leaving cities and states responsible for raising the rest.\n\n\"That's not going to work,\" LaHood said. \"Why not replenish the Highway Trust Fund? Raise the gas tax, and go back to back to the formula of 80-20 because the states have no money.\"", "California Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters said an investigation into President Donald Trump's personal financial dealings with Deutsche Bank is just one of several issues the House Financial Services Committee has on its plate.\n\nWaters, who is in line to become chair of the committee next year when Democrats take control of the House, told Bloomberg News in an interview Wednesday that the committee was also focused on housing policies and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms that has been under attack by Republicans ever since.\n\nCongressional Democrats have already been investigating ties between Trump and Germany's Deutsche Bank, which has been ordered by regulators to shore up internal controls to prevent money laundering. Waters was one of a handful of lawmakers who requested information from the bank last year, including whether loans it made to Trump were guaranteed by the Russian government.\n\nAs the new majority on the committee, Waters could use subpoena power to put more force behind such requests. Asked whether she would use that power, Waters said: \"That's simply one piece of the business that we have to do. You know that we have requested information from the Treasury about everything from sanctions to Deutsche Bank, and we know that Deutsche Bank is identified as one of the biggest money laundering banks in the world, perhaps, and that they're the only ones who were amenable to providing loans to this president. So we want to know some things about that.\"\n\nShe added, \"We have the power to deal with subpoenas, but I want you to know we're not just focused on that alone.\"\n\nShe said supporting the CFPB is another task at hand, calling it one of \"the most important centerpieces\" of the 2010 reforms. Republicans have been trying to dismantle the agency from the start. This summer, Mick Mulvaney, a Trump economic advisor and its acting director, fired the CFPB's 25-member advisory board, some of whom had been critical of his leadership.\n\n\"I've got to do everything that I can possibly do to undo some of the harm that Mr. Mulvaney has done,\" Waters told Bloomberg. \"He is going to come to understand that he cannot just summarily dismiss the advisory committee. That's not going to work.\"\n\nWaters said the committee would also work to insure consumers are protected from fraud and predatory lending.\n\nAs for Trump, Waters said he should also steer clear of trying to direct the Federal Reserve's policies on interest rates and monetary issues. Trump has been publicly critical of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whom he nominated to the post. Powell has steadily raised interest rates, something Trump has said he is \"not thrilled\" with.\n\n\"The president should not interfere with the Federal Reserve,\" Waters said in the interview. \"The president doesn't understand. He's not a dictator, and he cannot interfere. As a matter of fact, he could really cause problems in the markets by just rolling out saying things that he should not say because he does not understand the complexity of how they make those decisions.\"\n\n\"He should leave him alone and let them do their work and not continue to try and make them do what he would have them do.\"\n\nWatch the Bloomberg interview here.", "Cold-pressed drink company Suja Life has tapped investment bank Evercore to explore a possible sale of the company, people familiar with the matter tell CNBC.\n\nThe move comes three years after Coca-Cola took a minority stake in the company, with an eye toward the trendier drink market. The deal came with an option for Coke to buy Suja after three years.\n\nAs part of the process, Suja could sell itself entirely or just a stake. Coke, as such, could choose to sell or retain its stake in the drink company.\n\nCoke spokeswoman Lauren Thompson said the company continues to invest in and partner with Suja, declining to comment on a potential sale.\n\n\"We believe in the mission of the company and its CEO, Jeff Church, and the future growth potential of the brand,\" Thompson said.\n\nEvercore declined to comment.\n\nSuja has roughly $100 million in revenue, one of the people told CNBC. A valuation of the company could not be immediately determined, but Coke valued it at roughly $300 million at the time of its investment.\n\nThe people asked not be named because the information is confidential.\n\nSuja made its name the cold-pressed juice market, a style of drink that is said to extend the life of fresh juices. Since then, it has expanded to make other drinks like Kombucha and probiotic vinegar juice.\n\nDeal activity in the beverage industry has been robust over the last few years as larger companies have looked for growth in younger brands as sales of carbonated drinks slow. With tastes and and trends constantly changing, some larger established companies have taken minority stakes to place smaller bets on trendier drinks, while others have bought companies outright.\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper earlier this year announced its intention to acquire Core Nutrition, maker of Core water, for $525 million. Coke earlier this year took a stake in sports drink BodyArmor.\n\nCoke previously said buying smaller companies serves \"many purposes, like filling gaps in our beverage portfolio or entering emerging categories.

Awareness of a brand is the most-tracked measurement, with 12 percent of respondents saying they do so, while only 7 percent measure the return on investment (ROI). \"CMOs must appease the often-skeptical CFO's expectations for ROI to justify future budgetary commitments, which means being able to clearly link marketing's investments with business return,\" it states.\n\nChief marketers are urged to use budgets more efficiently, even if times are good. Budgets in 2018 have leveled: In 2017 marketers spent 11.3 percent of their company's revenue on marketing, while in 2016 the figure was 12.1 percent.\n\nSixty-three percent of CMOs expect budgets to increase next year, but this optimism may be tempered by trade tariffs and Brexit uncertainty. American businesses paid $4.4 billion in tariffs in September, a 50 percent increase over the same month last year, according to a coalition of industry groups called Tariffs Hurt the Heartland.\n\nThe balance between TV and digital ad spend is often discussed, in the light of Facebook and Google taking ever more marketing budget. But TV advertising could increase in 2019, with 49 percent saying they plan to up their budgets for TV and other offline media. Marketers are showing more of an appetite for spending on sites such as Amazon, with digital commerce set to take 9.2 percent of ad budgets.\n\nSome advertisers are even moving more than half the budget they usually spend with Google search to Amazon, according to media agency executives, because some people start their product search on Amazon rather than Google.

Analysts had expected earnings of 87 cents per share and $2.93 billion in revenue, according to data compiled by Refinitiv.\n\nThe disappointing earnings erased almost all of the 9.9 percent rally in the shares Wednesday after California voters rejected a measure that would have cut into the company's profits.\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns a 23 percent stake in DaVita.\n\nThe ballot measure would have capped the amount of money dialysis providers in the state can earn on treating certain patients.\n\nPushed by the Service Employees International Union, the measure would have limited the revenue dialysis providers could earn through rates from privately insured patients to 115 percent of the costs to provide the care.\n\nDaVita, which operates half of all the chronic dialysis clinics in the state, had shelled out $66.6 million of the more than $110 million spent by the industry lobbying against Proposition 8.\n\nWATCH:Why you shouldn't panic when stocks are getting slammed", "Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fell in her office and fractured three ribs. The 85-year-old liberal justice was admitted to a hospital Thursday.\n\nGinsburg's health has been a matter of intense speculation in recent years. The court's oldest member, Ginsburg has survived multiple bouts with cancer, and in 2014 underwent a procedure to have a stent placed in her right coronary artery.\n\nThe fall happened Wednesday evening.\n\n\"She went home, but after experiencing discomfort overnight, went to George Washington University Hospital early this morning,\" the court said in a statement Thursday. \"Tests showed that she fractured three ribs on her left side and she was admitted for observation and treatment.\"\n\nIt is not the first time that Ginsburg has fractured her ribs while on the court. In June 2012, Ginsburg fractured two ribs in a fall and did not disclose the injury to the public until months later. The court said at the time that despite the fracture, Ginsburg \"did not skip a beat.\"\n\nThe Brooklyn-native, one of four liberal justices on the nine-member court, has said she plans to serve on the bench until she is 90, and has hired law clerks through 2020.\n\nHer approach to the law has been described as cautious, though she has been influential in shaping jurisprudence in cases involving gender discrimination, women's reproductive health and international law.\n\nShe was the principal author of a landmark brief that led Supreme Court in 1971 to apply the the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to women.\n\nGinsburg, the second of four women to serve on the high court, was appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993.

One key metric that fell below expectations was platform revenue, which encompasses streaming advertising.\n\nPlatform advertising is shaping up to be an increasingly important component of the company's strategy because Roku is in talks with media companies it hopes will bring more content to its app, CNBC reported Wednesday. While Roku reported total revenue of $173.4 million compared with the $169.1 million analysts surveyed by Refinitiv were expecting, platform revenue was $100.1 million for the quarter versus the $103.2 million forecast by StreetAccount and FactSet.\n\nRoku has not been able to make as much money per customer as analysts expected, reporting average revenue per user (ARPU) of $17.34, below the $17.44 forecast by StreetAccount.\n\nIn an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Alley\" on Thursday, CEO Anthony Wood touted the effectiveness of the company's platform for advertisers trying to reach viewers in the 18-to-34-year-old demographic.\n\n\"If you're an advertiser, you're seeing your viewers shift from traditional linear TV to streaming,\" Wood said. \"Ten percent of the people in that key demographic have shifted not just to streaming but to Roku in particular, so if you want to reach them with a video ad, you need to advertise on Roku.\"\n\nHe also said streaming ads \"are just a fundamentally better advertising unit\" than traditional TV ads because advertisers know what they are getting out of their spending. When Roku shows advertisers data on how their ads perform, Wood said, \"that helps advertisers have the confidence to increase their budgets.\"\n\nHe acknowledged the ad dollars could take a while to catch up to the technology.\n\n\"When viewers moved to mobile, the ad dollars took a few years to catch up. But they will catch up,\" Wood said.\n\nAnalyst notes Thursday morning still indicated confidence in the stock, ranging from neutral to buy ratings. Guggenheim Securities wrote that Roku's \"stated initiatives and potential expansion opportunities are under-appreciated,\" citing its established technology and user base as advantages in the competitive streaming space.\n\nD.A. Davidson gave Roku a neutral rating, on the other hand, as the increase in active accounts missed its estimates but still \"was more than offset\" by increased streaming hours and ARPU that beat its expectations.\n\n\u2014CNBC's Sara Salinas contributed to this report.", "In 2014, Scott Nailor, a high school English teacher from Scarborough, Maine, went more than 270 days without making a payment on his student loans and so ended up in default. Nailor couldn't keep up with his loan payments while balancing other kinds of debt and providing for his family so, in addition to defaulting, he and his wife filed for bankruptcy.\n\nNailor had struggled to keep up with his debt since 2000, when he graduated from college owing $35,000. When he stopped making payments over a decade later, his balance had swelled to $55,000, thanks to continually accruing interest.\n\nAfter he defaulted, Nailor decided that rehabilitating his loans was the best way to get back on track. Federal student loans in default are eligible for rehabilitation, a process that restores loans to good standing after nine monthly payments to a collection agency contracted by the Department of Education.\n\nStudent loan rehabilitation programs are one way for borrowers to move forward with repayment after defaulting on federal student loans. But many borrowers don't fully understand the risks, experts say. Since rehabilitation can add a significant amount of money to your balance, the drawbacks can outweigh the benefits and even put borrowers at risk of defaulting again.", "Facebook hasn't found its place in hardware, but it's getting closer.\n\nUnlike Apple, Amazon or even Google, Facebook has struggled to find a hardware product with mass appeal.

He says one particular chart illustrates the high risk of another wave of selling.\n\n\"We're focused on cycles, the direction of economic growth,\" Achuthan told CNBC's \"Trading Nation\" on Wednesday. \"What we see, and we've seen this for quite some time, is that whenever you have a deceleration in growth, you're going to get some impacts in the equity markets.\"\n\nDuring periods of slower growth in 2010, 2012, and 2015 to early 2016, for example, the S&P 500 experienced a sharp downturn, says Achuthan.\n\n\"In the post-GFC [global financial crisis] environment, the way that that manifests is that you see a higher risk of a market correction,\" he said.\n\nThe S&P 500 has already entered and rebounded from correction territory twice this year on worries over peak earnings and economic growth. A more than 10 percent drop from 52-week highs marks a correction.\n\nIn February, the S&P 500 tumbled 12 percent from its then-record high of late January. During the worst of the October sell-offs, the S&P 500 was down more than 11 percent from its most recent record set in September.\n\n\"The question is, is the slowdown over?\" asked Achuthan. \"Is the deceleration in economic growth ending? And since the answer to that is no, the leading indicators still show some weakness in front of us, the risk of another correction remains. It's that simple.\"\n\nWhile Achuthan says gross domestic product and unemployment figures suggest a roaring economy, a deeper dive into economic data backs up his view of a weakening expansion.\n\n\"There's something called gross domestic income, and it's just as valid as GDP, and the growth rate there peaked a year ago and has been decelerating,\" he said. \"It's not a recession, very, very clear. But it is a deceleration. We've had three of them already since the last recession. This is the fourth one.\"\n\nAchuthan says if trends persist, the risk of the S&P 500 falling another 10 percent to 20 percent from current levels remains high. The higher end of that range would translate to a drop to levels not seen since the beginning of 2017.", "Check out the companies making headlines before the bell:\n\nARRIS International \u2013 The maker of communications hardware and software will be acquired by CommScope for $7.4 billion, including assumed debt.

Cisco previously announced partnerships with the other two major cloud providers, Google and Microsoft, but Amazon is by far the leader in the cloud infrastructure market.\n\nThe broad trend they're playing into with the new offering is around containers, a modern way for developers to move code between machines. Amazon offers a service for deploying containers on servers in its data centers, and Cisco has developed software that works on servers that companies manage themselves.\n\nBoth draw on the Kubernetes open-source software, which originated at Google.\n\n\"Containers are the way applications are built today,\" said David Goeckeler, executive vice president and general manager of Cisco's networking and security business, in an interview. \"The question is where are they going to run it.\"\n\nCisco remains a powerful player in the world of traditional data centers, where companies are buying their own networking switches and routers. But increasingly that infrastructure has moved to the cloud, making it difficult for Cisco and other data center companies to find growth in their main markets.

Patil likes Amazon's long-term growth potential.\n\nAs for Etsy shares, Gilbert said the options market is not signaling that investors are \"nervous\" about where the stock is headed, but the options are pricing in a probability of roughly 25 percent that the stock could be \"cut in half over the next year.\"\n\n\"Investors who want to protect those recent gains could consider buying puts,\" she said. \"They are not expensive relative to history.

He would still look to buy pullbacks in Etsy because he likes its momentum, though for a near-term trade he would rather own Amazon.\n\n\"If I had to buy anything for a three- to five-day period, I'd buy Amazon today, thinking that today's move is good, but overall Etsy could very well grow faster in the months to come,\" Newton said Wednesday on \"Trading Nation.\"\n\nEtsy shares closed Wednesday at $50.01 per share, while Amazon closed at $1,755.49, a 7 percent gain.", "Police said at least 12 people have died after a shooting at a crowded restaurant in Thousand Oaks, California.

So far this year, the central bank has raised rates three times.\n\nAt their most recent meeting in late September, Fed officials collectively projected that they would end up raising their key short-term rate four times this year and three times in 2019. The Fed's benchmark rate affects many consumer and business loans, and when it raises it, borrowing can become more expensive for many.\n\nIn recent weeks, financial markets have been gripped by worry and volatility, and some analysts think that in its statement Thursday the Fed may take note of that anxiety as a potential risk to economic growth.\n\nAs it happens, this week's meeting will be the last that will not include a news conference by the Fed chairman. Beginning in 2019, Chairman Jerome Powell has said he will hold a news conference after each of the Fed's eight meetings each year, rather than only at every other meeting.\n\nIn its statement, the Fed is all but sure to announce that it will keep its key rate unchanged in a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent, the level it reached in September when the Fed raised it for the third time this year.\n\nBeginning in late 2015, the central bank has gradually raised its key rate from a record low near zero, where it had held it since the 2008 financial crisis to try to stabilize the financial system and stimulate growth. With the economy growing briskly and in its 10th year of expansion \u2014 the second-longest stretch on record \u2014 the Fed is aiming to keep future inflation under control.\n\nSome analysts say they think the fundamental message from the Fed on Thursday will be that with a strong economy and unemployment at a near five-decade low of 3.7 percent, steady if modest rate hikes should remain in place for now. Last week, the government said that employers added a robust 250,000 jobs in October and that average pay grew 3.1 percent over the previous 12 months \u2014 the best year-over-year gain in a decade.\n\n\"Look for the statement following the meeting to highlight the recent and welcome pickup in wages and the further drop in the unemployment rate,\" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.\n\nThe quickened pace of economic growth \u2014 a 3.5 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, after a 4.2 percent rate the previous quarter \u2014 has raised the risk that inflation could begin accelerating. So far, though, inflation has remained around the Fed's 2 percent target for annual price increases.\n\nIn its most recent forecast, the Fed projected that it would raise rates three additional times in 2019 but private economists are split. Some believe there will be four hikes in 2019 as the Fed responds to continued strong growth while some see only one or two hikes next year as the boost from the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts passed last year begins to fade.\n\nPowell has stressed that the Fed is determined to follow a centrist approach: Keep gradually nudging up rates to control inflation but avoid tightening too aggressively and perhaps triggering a recession.\n\nBut President Donald Trump has sharply disagreed, and since the stock market started tumbling last month, he has attacked the Fed's rate hikes as well as Powell's leadership.\n\nTrump's public criticism has aroused concern that he is intruding on the political independence the Fed needs to assure markets that it will make tough choices when needed to keep inflation under control.\n\nWhile Trump has called the Fed's rate hikes his \"biggest threat,\" Powell, who was Trump's hand-picked choice to lead the Fed, has avoided responding directly to the criticism. He has instead expressed determination to pursue the Fed's mandate of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices without regard to political considerations.\n\nWATCH:Five market experts break down how to invest as interest rates spike", "The White House has suspended the press pass of CNN correspondent Jim Acosta after he and President Donald Trump had a heated confrontation during a news conference.\n\nThey began sparring Wednesday after Acosta asked Trump about the caravan of migrants heading from Latin America to the southern U.S. border.

The study did not pinpoint reasons driving the trend, but people are searching for ways to de-stress, and brands such as meditation apps Headspace and Calm are helping to bring meditation mainstream.\n\nThe researchers studied how many people said they used meditation, practiced yoga or visited a chiropractor within the past year in the National Health Interview Survey.

J.C. Penney is getting an even earlier start and opening at 2 p.m.\n\nWalmart has already said it's expecting its best holiday season ever and will have new technology in stores, such as maps and mobile checkout, to help shoppers have a painless experience and speed through stores.\n\nStill, the battle for shoppers' dollars online continues between Walmart and its biggest rival, Amazon. The e-commerce company said this week it will offer free shipping to all customers \u2014 not just Prime customers \u2014 for a limited time during the holiday season. Walmart continues to offer free, two-day shipping for orders more than $35. Target on Nov. 1 removed its threshold and now is offering free, two-day shipping on all digital purchases through Dec. 22.\n\nWalmart hopes that deep discounts on kids' bikes, wireless headphones, iPhones and Google Home devices will lure shoppers to stores. On its website, it will have 18 unique Black Friday deals live as early as midnight Thursday \u2014 including a Sharp 55-inch Class 4K Ultra HD HDR Smart LED TV on sale for $299 and a Farberware Oil-Less Fryer on sale for $39.\n\nThe average American household is expected to spend $1,536 through the holidays, according to a survey by Deloitte of more than 4,000 consumers during September. That represents a 25 percent increase from a year ago. Many retailers are optimistic about their 2018 performance thanks to strong consumer confidence in the U.S. and low unemployment that's giving shoppers the ability to spend more.\n\nForty-four percent of people say they'll rely on Black Friday to start shopping this holiday season, while 53 percent are holding out to shop until Cyber Monday, Deloitte found in the same survey.\n\n\"Although the rate of online sales growth is accelerating faster than that of physical stores, retailers should put resources behind both to be relevant,\" said Rod Sides, head of Deloitte's U.S. retail and distribution team. \"Online convenience is a way of life for most people, but what a person buys is still influenced by what happens in the store.\"\n\nWalmart is set to report quarterly earnings before the bell next Thursday.", "Ford confirmed Thursday it has agreed to buy scooter-sharing company Spin.\n\nThe deal was initially reported by Axios, which put its value at about $40 million. A person familiar with the deal later told CNBC that its value was closer to $100 million.\n\nThe move is a bid to beef up Ford's holdings in transportation and \"mobility\" businesses that don't involve selling cars, and to tap what executives say is a rapidly growing market.\n\nSeveral scooter start-ups, such as Bird and Lime, have risen to prominence recently, and some see these companies as yet another form of transportation, along with ride hailing, that could undermine the need many households have for a garage filled with cars.\n\nSan Francisco-based Spin rents out \"dockless\" scooters, meaning users do not have to park them in designated areas or \"docks,\" as is commonly seen with similar sorts of services, such as bike-share programs. It operates in 13 cities and college campuses, including Denver, Detroit, Long Beach, California; Coral Gables, Florida and Troy University in Alabama. It also has bike-share programs at the University of Kentucky and the University of California, San Diego.\n\nBy the end of 2018, Spin plans to operate in Washington, D.C.; Austin, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; Durham, North Carolina, as well as nearby Duke University; and Towson University in Maryland.\n\nFord has made a number of investments in mobility companies through its Smart Mobility division. In early 2018, the automaker bought Autonomic, a company that makes software meant to connect vehicles and organize transportation networks. When Autonomic CEO Sunny Madra joined Smart Mobility, he was named the head of Ford X, an incubator designed to help grow new businesses that can target customers who may be losing interest in traditional car ownership.\n\nMicro-mobility businesses like Spin are growing in a much different way than ride-sharing did, according to Madra. Cities are requiring permits and putting caps on the number of scooters a company can put in an area and where they can be placed.\n\nMadra told CNBC that Ford chose to acquire Spin because the company works fit Ford's values. \"They always launch in markets where they have permits, they work very closely with cities to understand what their needs are,\" he said.\n\nFord wants to expand Spin's business to about 100 places within 18 months.\n\n\"We are really going to give them significant resources to help them scale,\" Madra said, adding that the Spin will be able to leverage relationships Ford already has with different cities.\n\nThe potential market is large. Madra cited data from transportation research firm Populus, which found that half of all trips in the U.S. are 3 miles or less.\n\n\"Some of the leading companies in this space were getting upwards of 10 million rides in less than a year,\" Madra said. \"And if you compare that to the most disruptive transportation company in the last 10 years, being Uber, it took them three years to get to get the same level of usage. So it became obvious there was consumer desire in this space.\"\n\nUnderstanding how to scale a business like this will be key.\n\n\"That is an important fact because as we grow out our range of mobility offerings, we think autonomous vehicles are going to undergo the same sort of scrutiny that the scooters are in that sense,\" he said. \"Companies will need to get permits, and there will be caps, and companies will need to operate in very distinct ways.\"\n\nWATCH:Ford is using bionic suits to help employees work safer", "Ping An's fintech growth is going to be exponential: CEO 5:23 AM ET Thu, 8 Nov 2018 | 02:24\n\nFinancial technology has reached a tipping point for China's Ping An Technology and future growth in that area is set to be exponential, according to CEO Ericson Chan.\n\nYears of investment and research into fintech is paying off, Chan told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday.\n\n\"I think we are just hitting a tipping point because of all the investments ... and the pie is getting bigger also \u2014 the growth is not linear, it's going to be exponential,\" he said. \"A lot of the capability that we've built over the years is exciting right now.\"\n\nPing An Technology is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ping An Group, a major finance conglomerate in China that does business in insurance, banking, investment and technology.

Assuming he gets the chairmanship of the House Committee on Agriculture, Peterson will have sway over large federal programs involving the farm sector as well as hold hearings and help shape policies involving agricultural trade, nutrition programs such as food stamps, rural development and conservation, as well as the large farm bill.\n\n\"The president is doing his thing,\" said Peterson. \"I don't agree with what he's doing as it relates to agriculture.\"\n\nThat said, Peterson agrees that there are some \"problems with China\" as it relates to fair trade. \"But I think we're being held hostage by something I'm not sure is going to be resolved in our favor in the end anyway. I don't see any scenario where agriculture is going to be better off than we were before all this started with China.\"\n\nIn the case of China, American soybeans have been a major target of Beijing's tariffs. About 60 percent of the soybeans grown in Minnesota are exported, and about half of them in recent years have gone to customers in China.\n\nMinnesota's agriculture industry also relies heavily on exports to Canada and Mexico. Together, the two U.S. allies account for nearly half of Minnesota's agricultural exports, according to Kevin Paap, president of the Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation.\n\nDespite the new trade deal announced with Canada and Mexico, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the two allies continue to have retaliatory tariffs on products in response to Trump's duties on imported aluminum and steel. Peterson said Wednesday he planned to support the replacement deal for the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\n\"Ag exports are really important economic drivers,\" said Paap. \"Our biggest concern in agriculture is that once you lose the market, it's really hard to get it back. And we don't want to lose those markets, those relationships.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has offered about $6 billion in initial relief to U.S. farmers affected by retaliatory tariffs to help them weather the trade war.\n\n\"The farm bureau certainly prefers trade over aid,\" said Paap, who grows soybeans and corn in southern Minnesota.\n\nPaap also said it was welcome news for Minnesota's agribusiness that Peterson would chair the agriculture panel in the House.\n\n\"That is extremely important and very valuable,\" the farm official said. \"We saw Mr. Peterson as chairman of the House Agriculture Committee prior, so he's not an unknown commodity.\"\n\nPaap continued, \"We've seen over the years, whether you're chairman or ranking member, a lot of agriculture things coming out of the ag committee are written in a bipartisan manner.\"\n\nAt the same time, Peterson also is one of four top leaders on the joint House-Senate conference committee tasked with negotiating differences over the farm bill. The Senate's $428 billion farm bill passed in late June, but unlike the GOP-led House version, it didn't include stricter working requirements for food stamps that the Democrats have opposed.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that the stricter work requirement provisions could see about 1.2 million low-income Americans lose their benefits.\n\nThere also are other sticking points in reaching an agreement on the new farm bill, including differences over reductions to conservation programs and farmer payment limits in the Senate version that were introduced by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, but are at odds with the House version.\n\nPeterson told reporters Wednesday that the farm bill remains his \"No. 1 goal\" and added that the joint conference committee is \"relatively close. I think we can work this out and get this done before this Congress adjourns.\"\n\nIf the conference committee fails to resolve farm bill differences in the lame-duck session, however, a new Congress could take up the legislation next year when Democrats have control of the House. The farm bill is usually renewed every five years, and the lion's share of the bill's funding is devoted to programs such as food stamps.\n\nWATCH: Twelve US execs explain how Trump's trade war affects their bottom lines", "Cisco Systems Inc.: \"The CSCO kind should be bought right here.

I think that opportunity continues now that we have the evidence we need to prove that this business keeps accelerating.\"\n\nThat evidence lies in the cloud players' earnings reports, the \"Mad Money\" host said. New Relic, a company that manages website traffic for businesses in real time, said Tuesday that it was seeing accelerating growth.\n\nTwilio's earnings results were dramatically better than expected, driven in part by business from Uber. Total annual recurring revenues at Tableau Software, which builds data analytics platforms for businesses, were up 45 percent year over year.\n\nTo top it off, semiconductor giant Advanced Micro Devices recently announced it would start selling its chips to Amazon, where demand for the cloud-focused Amazon Web Services arm is \"growing like crazy,\" Cramer said.\n\n\"These ... software companies are all integral to the cloud, and their businesses are all accelerating,\" he continued. \"The cloud sell-off turned out to be very wrong for one incredibly simple reason: the fundamentals.\"", "Etsy CEO: 'Free shipping is pretty much table stakes' in e-commerce today 10:52 AM ET Thu, 8 Nov 2018 | 01:22\n\nE-commerce companies are under pressure to offer free shipping from deal-chasing consumers, and those who don't may run the risk of falling behind their competitors, Etsy President and CEO Josh Silverman said Wednesday.\n\n\"Free shipping is pretty much table stakes today,\" Silverman told CNBC's Jim Cramer in an exclusive interview. \"About half of all the items on Etsy, buyers say, have shipping prices that are too high.\"\n\nSpeaking after his handmade goods e-tailer reported better-than-expected earnings results and raised its full-year revenue guidance, Silverman said that sales were strong despite the shift in consumer preferences.\n\n\"We grew [gross merchandise sales] at 20 percent last quarter\" even with buyers' hesitation about shipping costs, he said on \"Mad Money,\" adding that \"only about 20 percent of items have free shipping\" in the broader e-commerce industry.\n\nEtsy's third-quarter results showed accelerating growth for the growing online marketplace, with a 41.3 percent boost in revenue year over year.\n\nThe company, which helps connect buyers with over 50 million handmade items, also raised prices this quarter, taking its commission from 3.5 percent to 5 percent per order in an effort to deliver more value to its \"makers,\" the CEO said.\n\n\"Charging a 5 percent commission ... was, I think, fair value for our sellers, particularly because we've invested almost all of that,\" Silverman told Cramer. \"Eighty percent of that we're reinvesting into the growth of the platform.\"\n\nAnd when it comes to what may be Etsy's biggest competitor, Amazon Handmade, and the new headquarters Amazon is reportedly opening in Queens, the CEO said Etsy \u2014 which is headquartered in Brooklyn \u2014 was confident about its value proposition to potential employees.\n\n\"We think we've got the best team, certainly, in tech companies on the eastern seaboard,\" Silverman said. \"We continue to attract great talent, and the reason is, first and foremost, I think our mission is really a meaningful, important mission, and that matters.\"\n\nShares of Etsy soared in Wednesday's trading session, ending the day up 23.7 percent at $50.01.

He ordered another to sit down. He told a third \u2013 an African-American who asked about white supremacy in light of his race-based appeals to white voters \u2013 that she had asked \"a racist question.\"\n\nIf that didn't demonstrate discomfort enough, Trump went on to outline a fantasy alternative to the rebuke voters actually delivered him on Election Day. He said the results indicated that voters like him, even though a solid majority of them told exit pollsters they disapprove of his presidency. He suggested he had bested President Obama, who campaigned for a Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Georgia, because the Republican had won. (NBC News had yet to make a call in the race as of Thursday morning.)\n\nTrump ascribed Democratic House gains to extraneous factors \u2013 superior fund-raising, retirement decisions by Republican incumbents \u2013 rather than the anvil his divisive presidency hung around the necks of GOP members in suburban districts. He openly mocked members who tried to survive by distancing themselves from him, calling them out by name and adding sarcastically, \"too bad.\"\n\nThat offered a bitter refresher course in his self-absorption for Republican members who have shielded his scandal-tarred presidency from oversight while they pursued shared economic goals of tax-cuts.\n\n\"It disgusts me that he did that,\" retiring GOP Rep. Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania texted me during the press conference. \"I'm so angry about it i can't even begin to speak.\"\n\nCostello concluded: \"Those members that lost deal with hell for two years \u2013 because of him.\"\n\nAs a result, Trump has lost his shield. Among the first actions House Democrats took on election night was to confirm they will exercise their rights to demand the president's tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service \u2013 a step Republicans refused to take.", "If CNBC's Jim Cramer knows one thing about the United States Congress, it's that \"a house divided against itself can produce some amazing profits\" for investors, he said one day after the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Democratic Party regained control in the House of Representatives, while the Republican Party maintained its majority in the Senate. Results like these tend to cause congressional gridlock, which is usually good for stock-pickers, Cramer said.\n\n\"Gridlock comes with another set of consequences,\" Cramer, host of \"Mad Money,\" said Wednesday as stocks surged higher.\n\nOne such consequence could be \"a slowdown in the U.S. economy, as there's very little chance that we'll get a second tax cut or an infrastructure bill, or anything that could give us a boost\" given that newly empowered House Democrats may not want to give the president what he wants ahead of 2020, Cramer said.\n\n\"What do you do in this situation? You buy the fastest-growing companies, the ones that can keep making their numbers in a slowdown,\" he said. Among his recommendations were the cloud stocks, many of which reported strong earnings on Tuesday, as well as the stocks of Amazon and Apple.\n\n\"[Amazon] may have sandbagged with its conservative guidance, giving a low-ball number that can be beaten,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"Any company willing to have three global headquarters must be doing pretty darned well.\"\n\nAs for Apple, Cramer pointed to his Tuesday analysis with Carolyn Boroden, a reputable technician who said the iPhone maker's stock could start rallying as soon as this week.\n\nOther potential winners were health-care plays HCA, UnitedHealth and Centene, all of which benefit from House Democrats preserving the current state of U.S. health care, Cramer said. He also blessed buying big pharmaceutical names like Johnson & Johnson, Merck and Pfizer and device plays Abbott Labs, DexCom and Medtronic.\n\n\"Finally, I've got to admit that the White House is a neverending source of fantastic stock opportunities,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said, addressing the news that Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned under pressure from President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Sessions hated pot more than anyone else\" in the government, he said. \"The news of his departure sent Canopy Growth and the rest of the cannabis stocks flying, as investors wagered that no attorney general could be worse on this issue.\"\n\nAnd while Cramer still worried about the Federal Reserve's plans for interest rates, he said that falling oil prices and slumping mortgage applications could change the central bank's tune.\n\n\"Now that the [election] is in the rear-view mirror, we can surge higher like we did today, but we're still hostage to the Fed,\" he said. \"I don't mind the December rate hike. Employment's still red hot. [...] I just hope that they'll look at what's happening in all parts of the economy, not just the consumer, not just unemployment, and decide that they can afford to wait and see what's going to happen before tightening any more than that.\"", "The embattled attorney general resigned at the \"request\" of Trump on Wednesday. Sessions' chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, will serve as acting attorney general. Whitaker will assume oversight of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian election interference and possible collusion by Trump's campaign into that meddling.\n\nWhitaker, who has publicly criticized the Mueller investigation, will have the power to fire the special counsel \"for cause.\"\n\nRep.

Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., the anticipated House Judiciary chairman come next year, called for answers. He tweeted Wednesday afternoon: \"We will be holding people accountable.\"\n\nDan Clifton, head of policy research at Strategas Research, said he \"absolutely\" thinks Democrats will work with Republicans to pass bipartisan legislation despite possible investigations.\n\n\"It's about timing. We're going to have to pass a budget. We're going to have to raise the debt ceiling. We're forced into that regardless of what's happening in the investigations,\" he said on Closing Bell.\"\n\n\"At the end of the day, the Democrats are going to have to bring results home so that they can win re-election. They won very tight races in Republican districts to take over the majority.\"\n\nWhat interests Ed Mills, policy analyst at Raymond James, is the escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China. And he's concerned that a possible investigation into Trump may ramp up that rhetoric, he said.\n\n\"Trump has a history of whenever there is a series of negative headlines to try to change the subject,\" he told \"Closing Bell.\" \"The one subject that he can absolutely change the press narrative on is doubling down on China.\"\n\nHe also said if Trump ultimately winds up firing Mueller, the market may brush it off.\n\n\"One of the things that we see with the Trump administration is that something that seems like the biggest thing today, because Trump goes from crisis to crisis to crisis \u2014 we generally move on,\" Mills said.\n\n\"What the market will look at is the deregulatory agenda that is coming out of the Senate and what could actually happen legislatively out of the House. \u2026 Anything that's even potentially on that list is more fiscal stimulus.\"\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Jacob Pramuk and Dan Mangan contributed to this report.", "Final Trades: EEM, LEN & more\n\n6:03 PM ET Wed, 7 Nov 2018\n\nThe \"Fast Money\" traders share their final trades of the day, including emerging markets, Lennar, Michael Kors and Alibaba.", "Technician says these are 3 tech stocks to play for a year-end rally\n\n5:52 PM ET Wed, 7 Nov 2018\n\nRobert Sluymer, Fundstrat Global Advisors, on whether the tech wreck is over.

Voters in Utah and Missouri also relaxed their laws to allow medical marijuana in Tuesday's midterm election.\n\n\"Individually, it's just another data point that suggests that the desire for sensible cannabis reform at a state and a citizen level is enhancing in every election season,\" said Rosen, former CEO of PharmaCan Capital, which later became Cronos Group.\n\nHowever, voters in North Dakota, where medical marijuana is legal, declined legalizing the drug for recreational use Tuesday. And weed is still illegal federally, which presents a host of other challenges for the budding pot industry.\n\nBut cannabis stocks are rising on hopes that more help for further reform could be on the way in the near future.\n\nAfter losing most of their gains from Wednesday's premarket, shares of Tilray, Canopy Growth, Aurora Cannabis, Cronos Group and Aphria spiked after a surprise ouster of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who opposes legalization.\n\nIn addition, the incoming Democratic-controlled House could be more favorable to relaxing federal laws, and a record number of Americans support legalization, a Gallup poll shows.\n\n\"What will presage that breakout event will be a series of incremental steps, such as the states' acts passing,\" Rosen said.\n\n\"As to when that seismic event \u2026 will resolve the dichotomy between federal and state law, my own feeling is that it's going to happen post-2020 and close to the next midterm in 2022,\" he said.\n\nCorrection: This article has been updated to clarify that Paul Rosen is former CEO of PharmaCan Capital, which later became Cronos Group.\n\nWATCH:The cannabis sativa plant isn't just for smoking.

On the other hand, GOP victories in key presidential swing states could bolster Trump's confidence of winning re-election in 2020.\n\nHere's how Tuesday's mixed midterm results could affect Trump.\n\nThe House\n\nNo result is more damaging for Trump and his agenda than Democrats regaining control of the House.\n\nIt puts staunch Trump foe Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on track to return as speaker.\n\nThe Democratic victory means the party has effective veto power over legislative initiatives sought by the Trump administration.\n\nTo get a bill passed into law, Trump, and Republicans in the Senate and the House, will have to negotiate with Democrats in ways they have not been accustomed to for some time.\n\nIn particular, Republicans will be unable, as they tried to do in 2017, to effectively repeal and replace much of the Affordable Care Act, as the Democrat-backed Obamacare law is formally known.\n\nWith their regained power, Democrats, who will take over committee chairships, also will be in position to investigate Trump and his administration in a variety of areas that Republicans showed scant interest in examining when they controlled the House.\n\nThat includes eyeing the president's campaign contacts with Russians, foreign financial connections to the Trump Organization, Trump's immigration enforcement actions and controversial spending by a number of Cabinet secretaries.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who will become chairman of the Judiciary Committee, pointedly reminded Trump on Tuesday night that \"he and his administration will be held accountable.\"\n\nAnother big target for Democrats in the House will be Trump's personal income tax returns, which the president, flying in the face of decades of common practice by his predecessors, has refused to make public.\n\nMSNBC reported Tuesday night that Democrats in control of the House Ways and Means Committee plan on requesting Trump's tax returns under a federal law that gives them such power. Sources who spoke with MSNBC said the committee will be willing to go to court to force Trump to comply with a subpoena for his returns if he refuses.\n\nAsked at a news conference Wednesday what he would do if a subpoena is issued for his tax returns, Trump said, \"Look, they're under audit, they're extremely complex, people wouldn't understand them.\"\n\n\"People don't understand tax returns,\" he said. Trump added that he would consider releasing his returns once an audit was completed by the IRS, but \"nobody turns over returns when it's under audit.\"\n\nTrump also warned that if House Democrats inundate his administration with subpoenas, \"we're going to do the same thing,\" and predicted the government would then effectively shut down.\n\nHouse Democrats now also will have the power to impeach Trump if they choose.\n\nBut Pelosi has dumped cold water on that idea, which has been pushed by some Democrats, telling PBS' \"News Hour\" \"that's not what our caucus is about.\"\n\nThe Senate\n\nThe fact that Republicans not only retained their majority in the Senate, but will add several seats, was Trump's biggest victory Tuesday night.\n\nThat win means Trump will be able to continue nominating, and winning approval for those nominations, of conservatives to the federal judiciary.\n\nWhile the Senate's recent controversial approval of federal appellate Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court received widespread attention, Trump in his first two years had also won approval from the Senate for 83 other nominees to the federal bench.", "Comcast plans to roll out a new product for broadband-only subscribers that will allow customers to aggregate certain streaming apps, including Netflix, Amazon Prime and YouTube, with a voice-activated remote \u2014 a response to the ongoing challenge of navigating video between a variety of sources, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe product, which will first be a set-top box and is meant to be an operating platform similar to X1, will launch next year, said the people, who asked not to be named because the internal discussions are private. Comcast hasn't decided how much it will charge per month for the device, said the people.\n\nComcast declined to comment on the plans.\n\nComcast currently gives its video customers access to its X1 platform, which aggregates cable TV with many of the same apps that will be available on the new product, such as Netflix and YouTube, said the people. The new product won't have cable TV, although it will give customers the option to rent shows and movies and upgrade to a Comcast video package, the people said.\n\nThe product isn't quite a direct competitor to Roku or Apple TV because it won't allow customers access to hundreds of apps, including streaming TV bundles like AT&T's DirecTV Now or Dish's Sling. Those services are direct competitors to Comcast's video bundle, and Comcast wouldn't be able to push its own video service to its broadband-only customers if it allowed them access to those bundled OTT services. Comcast hasn't decided the exact number of apps that will be accessible through the device, said the people.\n\nRather, Comcast wants the device to be the hub to the connected home, they said.

In some states, a governor's power to sign or veto congressional maps could decide the partisan balance.\n\nState party control will also play an important role in the 2020 presidential campaign, especially in traditional battleground states like Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nCongress now becomes split between Republican and Democratic control, and many keys issues like health-care reform may be decided in state capitols instead of Washington.\n\nDemocrats picked up full control of state government in Colorado, Illinois, Maine, New Mexico, New York and Nevada. Republicans lost full control to a divided government in Kansas, Michigan, New Hampshire and Wisconsin.\n\nThe shift in control came through a combination of changes in governorships and control of legislative chambers, many of which have been split between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nAfter Tuesday's vote, Minnesota is now the only state where the legislature is divided \u2014 the Senate remains in Republican control, while the House flipped to Democrats. The last time there was only one divided state legislature was more than 100 years ago in 1914, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nVoters elected Democrats to succeed Republican governors in Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico and Wisconsin. Alaskan voters flipped the other way, electing a Republican governor to succeed a Democrat.\n\nThat gave Republicans in Alaska full control of state government, the only such gain for the GOP.\n\nDemocrats also kept control of Connecticut, a traditionally Democratic state that Republicans had hoped to pick up.\n\nDespite their statehouse gains, Democrats lost high-profile governor's races in Florida and Ohio. A hotly contested governor's race in Georgia, where Democrat Stacey Abrams was seeking to become the first black woman to be elected governor of a U.S. state, remained too close to call on Wednesday.\n\nIn Florida, Democrat Andrew Gillum lost his attempt to become the state's first black governor, suffering a narrow defeat to Republican Ron DeSantis in a racially charged contest that drew national attention. Republicans also scored a major victory in Ohio's governor race, where Mike DeWine, the state attorney general, defeated Democrat Richard Cordray, who served as the first director of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nBut in Wisconsin, Democrat Tony Evers pulled off a narrow win in unseating Republican incumbent Scott Walker, according to NBC News.

The Trump administration restored sanctions on Iran, OPEC's third-biggest oil producer, on Monday.\n\n\"I gave some countries a break on the oil,\" Trump said during a lengthy, wide-ranging press conference the day after Republicans lost control of the House of Representatives in the midterm elections. \"I did it a little bit because they really asked for some help, but I really did it because I don't want to drive oil prices up to $100 a barrel or $150 a barrel, because I'm driving them down.\"\n\n\"If you look at oil prices they've come down very substantially over the last couple of months,\" Trump said. \"That's because of me. Because you have a monopoly called OPEC, and I don't like that monopoly.\"\n\nOil prices have tumbled as much as 20 percent from four-year highs on Oct. 3. However, the decline since Trump officials first announced the waivers on Friday has been significantly smaller \u2014 about 1 percent for international benchmark Brent crude and 3 percent for U.S. crude.\n\nMuch of the losses in the oil market over the past five weeks correlate to a sell-off in global markets that saw investors dump risk assets including crude oil futures. During the October swoon, the S&P 500 posted its worst monthly drop in seven years.\n\nAnother factor that took the froth out of the oil market last month was the growing consensus that global oil consumption will not expand as much as previously anticipated. Forecasters are knocking down their projections for oil demand due to concerns about global economic growth because of Trump's trade dispute with China and currency weakness in emerging markets.\n\nTrump can claim some credit for the third factor behind the oil price pullback. Output from Saudi Arabia, Russia and other crude-exporting nations is on the rise, and analysts generally believe that's in part because the Trump administration asked the Saudis to pump more oil to offset the impact of sanctions on Iran.\n\nOPEC and its oil market allies were also concerned that rising prices would shrink demand for oil. That's another reason the producers agreed to increase output earlier this year, partly reversing a policy of limiting supply. That policy, in place since 2017, helped end a historic oil price collapse that punished U.S. energy companies and oil-exporting nations alike.\n\nWhile Trump frequently criticizes OPEC publicly, his administration actually depends on the cartel to offset the impact of its Iran policy. Specifically, Trump relies on top exporter Saudi Arabia to leverage its influence over other OPEC members to increase output and prevent oil prices from spiking as Iran's exports dwindle.\n\nIn fact, oil market analysts broadly view Trump's decision to restore sanctions on Iran as a major catalyst for higher crude costs.", "Facebook's efforts to curtail the spread of misinformation on its services were put through their biggest test yet on Tuesday by the U.S. midterm elections.\n\nFor the most part, the company came through unscathed.\n\nIt's a major achievement for Facebook, which has spent much of the past two years facing questions over its efforts to curtail the spread of fake news, propaganda, hate speech and spam on its services. Academics and researchers criticized Facebook for not doing enough to block harmful content before the 2016 U.S. elections.\n\nMost visibly, the company set up a \"war room\" to fight the spread of misinformation. Although Fortune and others criticized it as a publicity stunt, the Facebook war room is made up of 20 people from Facebook's various divisions \u2014 including WhatsApp, Instagram and others -- dedicated to identifying and removing false and fake accounts trying to influence the U.S. midterm elections.\n\nBehind the scenes, Facebook has hired thousands of staffers and contractors since 2016 to review and remove harmful content. The company now has 7,500 content moderators \u2014 up from 4,500 in May 2017 \u2014 who are part of a team of 20,000 people working on safety and security. Those moderators work in conjunction with AI systems that the company has built \"that can flag content that might be problematic,\" Zuckerberg told analysts during the company's earnings call last week.\n\nAs Election Day approached, Facebook stepped up its work. In the two weeks leading up to Tuesday, the company removed hundreds of accounts and pages engaged in \"coordinated inauthentic behavior.\" On Monday night , Facebook said that it had removed more than 100 accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency, a Russian organization which was accused earlier this year by Special counsel Robert Mueller of being \"engaged in operations to interfere with the elections and political processes.\"\n\nOn Election Day, the company was actively removing content that offered inaccurate voting information, including posts and memes directing Americans to vote on wrong days and content spreading a false claim that ICE agents were stationed at polling locations.\n\n\"Our teams worked around the clock during the midterms to reduce the spread of misinformation, thwart efforts to discourage people from voting, and deal with issues of hate on our services,\" a spokeswoman for Facebook told CNBC.\n\n\"There's still more work to do, as many of these bad actors are well-funded and change their tactics as we improve. It's why we continue to invest heavily in security, and are working more closely with governments, as well as other tech companies, to help prevent the spread of misinformation and outside interference in elections globally.\"", "Why this expert is neutral on Square 4:48 PM ET Wed, 7 Nov 2018 | 01:58\n\nPayment company Square reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat analysts' expectations on Wednesday but came up slightly short on forward guidance.\n\nHere's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected:\n\nEarnings: 13 cents per share vs. 11 cents per share forecast by Refinitiv.\n\n13 cents per share vs. 11 cents per share forecast by Refinitiv. Revenue: $431 million vs. $413.9 million forecast by Refinitiv.\n\nAdjusted revenue grew 68 percent year over year. The company reported its first quarterly profit of $20 million, compared with a net loss of $16 million in the third quarter of last year. Square's chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, said a \"big driver\" of the profitability was the investment in EventBrite, which went public in October.\n\nSquare met expectations for Wall Street's fourth-quarter revenue guidance, but came up short on earnings guidance for the upcoming quarter. It expects to earn between 12 and 13 cents, below Wall Street's expectations of 15 cents for the fourth quarter.\n\nShares of the fintech company fell more than 3.5 percent in after-hours trading Wednesday. The stock has popped more than 120 percent year over year, and is up 136 percent this year alone.\n\nSubscription- and services-based revenue was especially strong, up 155 percent year over year to $166 million in the third quarter. Caviar, Square Capital and Cash Card, a Visa debit card generated by Square's peer-to-peer Cash App, were key drivers of Square's third-quarter revenue growth, the company said.\n\n\"Clearly from the third quarter we're seeing strong momentum in our businesses,\" Friar said on the earnings call. \"That is symptomatic of a strong macro environment but also of the value proposition.\"\n\nIn October, Square announced Friar was stepping down to become CEO of start-up Nextdoor. Shares of Square dropped as much as 8 percent after the announcement.\n\nSquare CEO Jack Dorsey, who also runs Twitter, said on the call with analysts that Square had not yet hired a new CFO but was \"working with urgency\" to do so. Dorsey called finding Friar's replacement the \"No. 1 focus for the company.\"\n\nSquare has expanded its small-business lending \u2014 an increasingly competitive area in fintech \u2014 through Square Capital. In the third quarter of 2018, Square Capital facilitated more than 62,000 business loans, up 34 percent year over year.\n\nThe move into small business and exposure to consumer credit has been a cause of concern for some analysts. Friar acknowledged risks and said the diversity of Square's ecosystem should help balance that in any potential economic downturn.\n\n\"We are being very mindful of the risk that we are taking and using the very best technology to do it well,\" Friar said.\n\nSquare launched bitcoin trading through its popular Cash App in January and generated $43 million in revenue from the cryptocurrency in the third quarter.\n\nSan Francisco-based Square is well-known in the payments sector for its credit card processor, payment hardware and popular Cash app. While the company didn't give specific metrics on the app's growth, Dorsey said customers in many cases are now using it as a traditional bank.\n\n\"We do see people use the Cash App fundamentally as you would expect them to use a bank account,\" Dorsey said. \"They store money with us, it's accepted anywhere Visa is accepted. They can send and receive money from friends and family.\"", "News Corp. reported fiscal first-quarter earnings Wednesday that beat analysts' expectations for earnings but missed on revenue.\n\nHere's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:\n\nEarnings: 17 cents per share vs. 4 cents per share expected\n\n17 cents per share vs. 4 cents per share expected Revenue: $2.52 billion vs. $2.54 billion expected\n\nShares rose as much as 2.8 percent in after-hours trading.\n\nNews Corp. owns several publishing brands including The Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones, New York Post and HarperCollins. Media mogul Rupert Murdoch serves as co-chairman of the company along with his son Lachlan.\n\nRevenue growth at News Corp. has been driven by digital subscriptions amid declining advertising revenue, which fell 7 percent this quarter compared to the previous year. Digital subscribers accounted for 54 percent of overall subscription revenue at Dow Jones, which publishes Barron's and MarketWatch along with the Journal.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal gained 266,000 subscribers during the quarter compared to the previous year, and News. Corp said that nearly 65 percent of the paper's total subscribers are digital-only.\n\nNews Corp. also has a large online real estate business in its subsidiary Move, which owns Realtor.com.

Earlier this month, News Corp. completed an acquisition of Austin-based real estate startup Opcity for $210 million.", "Take-Two Interactive reported earnings for its 2019 fiscal second quarter after the bell on Wednesday. The company is known best for developing popular videogames like \"Red Dead Redemption\" and \"Grand Theft Auto\" as the parent company of Rockstar Games and 2K.\n\nThe stock was up over 2.5 percent after the bell.\n\nHere are the key numbers:\n\nRevenue: $583 million vs. $550 million estimated, according to Refinitv\n\nTake-Two reported a net income increase of $25.4 million compared to the net loss of $2.7 million it reported for the comparable period a year before. It raised its outlook for its fiscal year ending March 31. It now expects GAAP net revenue of $2.55 billion to $2.65 billion, compared to the $2.50 billion to $2.60 billion it expected as of last quarter.\n\nGuidance was bolstered by the blockbuster release of Rockstar's \"Red Dead Redemption 2.\" The Wild West-themed game raked in a record $725 million in worldwide retail consumer sales in the first three days on the shelves. In a statement last month, Take-Two said it was \"the single-biggest opening weekend in the history of entertainment,\" even topping Disney's record opening weekend for \"Avengers: Infinity War,\" which grossed over $640 million, according to Box Office Mojo data.\n\nThe launch of \"Red Dead Redemption 2\" fell only behind another Rockstar release for the highest grossing entertainment launches, according to Take-Two. \"Grand Theft Auto V\" made over $1 billion in retail sell-through in the first three days of its mid-week release in 2013.\n\nTake-Two Interactive has had to contend with with popular online games like Fortnite that are free to play. Rockstar Games has said it would release a public beta of \"Red Dead Online\" this month, which will be available for free to players who already own \"Red Dead Redemption 2\" for PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.\n\nIn its last earnings report, Take-Two beat analyst expectations on quarterly revenue, reporting $288.3 million in adjusted revenue compared to estimates of $258.4 million, according to Refinitiv.\n\n-CNBC's Eustance Huang and Reuters contributed to this report.", "\n\nIf Rep. Maxine Waters becomes chair of the House Financial Services Committee she may not be able to undo Republicans' deregulation efforts, but she could still hurt the nation's economic growth, the committee's current chair, Rep. Jeb Hensarling told CNBC on Wednesday.\n\nHe said there is a \"north of 99 percent chance\" that the Democrat from California will ascend to the position. Waters, a foe of Wall Street and harsh critic of President Donald Trump, has been the top Democrat on the banking panel since 2013.\n\n\"I don't believe that she will be successful in rolling back what the president and this current Congress has done,\" Hensarling, R-Texas, said on \"Power Lunch.\"\n\nHowever, \"she and others can slow down the pace of deregulation and thus harm economic growth in that way.\"\n\nLast May, Congress passed the biggest rollback of financial regulations since the financial crisis. Among other things, the legislation eased restrictions on all but the largest banks.\n\nWaters has called for increased regulation of the largest U.S. banks. In July, she pledged tougher fines for financial institutions that take advantage of customers.\n\n\"The question is, will the House Financial Services Committee continue to be a beehive of legislative activity \u2026 or will the committee basically be turned into a Spanish Inquisition or the Star Chamber to harass the administration, to intimidate the administration?\" said Hensarling, who did not seek re-election this year.\n\nHe said Waters may wind up using her subpoena power much more often than he ever did. That could end up being a challenge for the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the FDIC, or Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., he noted.\n\n\"It's going to be a test of what is their backbone made of because I assure you they will spend most of the day doing nothing but answering subpoenas for documents and appearances,\" Hensarling said. \"They will be sauteed, fried and grilled. There's no doubt about that.\"\n\nBut while Trump has called Waters \"crazy\" and an \"extraordinarily low IQ person,\" Hensarling said there is actually \"a tale of two Maxines.\"\n\nOn the one hand she is \"capable of being a serious legislator, of negotiating and being a leader,\" he said. However, Waters has also led the charge for impeaching Trump and has made incendiary comments, he added.\n\nHensarling also believes that many of the Democratic members of the committee want to legislate, he just doesn't know if Waters will \"let them do that.\"\n\n\"The American people know the difference between legitimate oversight and political harassment and intimidation, and they will be watching closely,\" he said.\n\nA spokesperson for Waters did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "When all the ballots are counted, Democrats are likely to pick up over 30 seats in the House and take control of the chamber. Democrats handily won Independents, white college educated women, non-whites and younger voters. Exceeding expectations, Republicans could see a net gain of three Senate seats. A strong economy buoyed Republican victories in the Senate and blunted losses in the House. Fully 68 percent of voters in last night's exit poll reported the economy was excellent or good and 60 percent of those voters supported Republicans.\n\nThe 116th Congress is likely to be the most gender and ethnically diverse in history and even though the final House tally is undetermined at this hour, divided government is a certainty.\n\nAs the country looks to the future, here are six things we know:\n\n1. The 2018 midterm election was the sixth change election of the last seven elections. The parties showed they are as polarized as ever, delivering a Democratic House and a larger Republican Senate.\n\n2. Democratic control of the House and the upcoming contest for the democratic nomination for president will likely move the party further to the left.\n\n3. Make no mistake about it, the 2020 presidential election has already begun with Democratic hopefuls already jockeying for support among the Democratic faithful. The 2020 Democratic primary will be protracted due to the fact that Democrats removed super delegates and they have no winner-take-all states.\n\n4. Trump's coalition in Congress is now stronger due to more conservatives in the Senate and fewer suburban Republicans in the House.\n\n5. Trump will embrace and benefit from the Pelosi-led House.

In exchange, Roku will lead advertising sales on their shows and take a larger share of the revenue.\n\nRoku executives have all expressed plans to expand its The Roku Channel streaming app into \"a house channel,\" similar to how Apple's TV app works today, three of the sources said.\n\nOther apps will still be allowed on the platform, but would not be featured as prominently as they are today. One proposed plan would make the Roku-owned free service the home screen, where people would be able to access partner content without switching from app to app, according to two of the executives. Roku would recommend shows and movies based on user data and pre-set categories. No sense of timing was given, but they were told the changes were a \"core focus\" for Roku's future plans, three of the sources said.\n\nA spokesperson for Roku said it does not comment on specific partner relationships or rumors or speculation.\n\nWith 22 million active accounts as of June, a Roku device or Roku-enabled smart TV is the main way that U.S. households stream TV shows and movies. It's also a method marketers can use to reach those viewers. The company has also vastly expanded its own app, The Roku Channel, making it available non-Roku devices like desktop computers via the internet and on mobile phones.\n\nWedbush Securities upgraded Roku last week to a buy due to its dominant position in OTT advertising and potential for international expansion. The company reports earnings on Wednesday.\n\nRoku is also facing stiff competition from other device makers with deeper pockets like Google's Chromecast, Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV. Amazon's streaming video advertising business is just starting up, but the company has also talked to media buyers about expanding its ad-supported video options, CNBC previously reported. Google has a live streaming TV service, YouTube TV, which it argues offers advertisers the exact TV audience they want to reach. And Apple is aggressively purchasing its own shows and movies for an upcoming service, although has indicated to media companies it will not be ad-supported.\n\nFor users, the changes could make it easier to find shows to watch without having to switch from app to app.\n\nBut it's really Roku who stands to gain the most. Roku's platform revenue reached $90.3 million last quarter, growing 96 percent year over year. Its average revenue per user (ARPU) reached $16.60. EMarketer projects Roku will generate $293 million in ad revenue in 2018, noting money floating to over-the-top (OTT) streaming video companies is going to continue to rise as TV ad spending declines.\n\n\"With Google and Facebook, you have the ability to place the ads, but you don't have the same type of content, something where users will spend 30 [minutes] to an hour undisturbed,\" said Raghu Kodige, chief product officer for TV data company Alphonso.\n\nApps that appear on Roku's platform have to let Roku sell up to 30 percent of their ad inventory and give up as much as 20 percent of one-time purchases (like movies). Larger, more popular streaming services have more negotiation power and may pay the company little to no fees.\n\nIf media companies agree to put their shows and movies on Roku's own service, the company is proposing it will handle sales and get 55 percent of the ad revenue, according to one industry executive. Ads would range from traditional 30-second ad breaks, display banner ads and sponsorship opportunities around themed video playlists. For example, a collection of road trip movies could get interest from an auto advertiser.\n\nMedia companies may be willing to sign on. They are already getting less money for their channels from cable companies, so they are more open to deals with companies like Roku because it's one way to increase revenue, according to one media executive. Roku also reaches the audience who don't have cable or satellite subscriptions, another executive noted. But whether the larger media companies will agree to give up 55 percent of the ad revenue remains to be seen, a source added. It will also increase competition for the apps that remain separate from Roku's streaming services.\n\nRoku shares dropped as much as 12 percent after hours on Wednesday as the company reported Q3 earnings. The company beat expectations on revenue and earnings and raised guidance, but came in slightly below expectations on platform revenue and average revenue per user.", "President Donald Trump's new acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, will oversee special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\n\"The Acting Attorney General is in charge of all matters under the purview of the Department of Justice,\" a spokeswoman for the department said Wednesday when asked if Whitaker would oversee Mueller's investigation.\n\nTrump announced in a pair of tweets minutes earlier on Wednesday that Attorney General Jeff Sessions would be replaced by Whitaker, who was Sessions' chief of staff at the Justice Department.

At about 3:45 p.m. ET, NBC reported that Rosenstein was headed to the White House for a \"previously scheduled meeting.\"\n\nWhitaker argued in an August 2017 op-ed for CNN that Mueller's investigation is \"dangerously close to crossing\" the so-called red line not to look into the Trump family's finances.\n\n\"It does not take a lawyer or even a former federal prosecutor like myself to conclude that investigating Donald Trump's finances or his family's finances falls completely outside of the realm of his 2016 campaign and allegations that the campaign coordinated with the Russian government or anyone else,\" Whitaker wrote in the piece.\n\n\"That goes beyond the scope of the appointment of the special counsel.\"\n\nLess than a month earlier, Whitaker had defended Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., for accepting a meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016 with Russian officials who had promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign.\n\n\"You would always take that meeting,\" Whitaker said on CNN.\n\nWhitaker, 49, is a former U.S. attorney in Iowa who ran for political office as a Republican. The National Association of Former United States Attorneys announced in October 2017 that Whitaker had been appointed as Sessions' chief of staff.\n\nIn 2014, Whitaker chaired the Iowa State Treasurer campaign of Sam Clovis, who became a campaign aide for Trump in the 2016 election. Clovis had reportedly discussed Russian relations with George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign foreign policy aide who pleaded guilty in October 2017 to lying to the FBI as part of the Mueller probe. Clovis has met with Mueller's team as well, The New York Times reported.\n\nReached by phone Wednesday, Clovis said, \"I'm not gonna talk to you today, sorry,\" before hanging up.\n\nSessions had been a frequent target of Trump's ire since he recused himself from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin.\n\nTrump has also criticized Rosenstein. \"I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director!\" Trump said in a June 2017 tweet, shortly after the special counsel was appointed.\n\nThe special counsel declined CNBC's request for comment on Sessions.\n\nSessions' resignation came less than 24 hours after most polls closed in the midterm elections. Democrats won majority control of the House of Representatives, while Republicans strengthened their hold on the Senate.\n\nThe announcement spurred an avalanche of statements from lawmakers of both major parties. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who appears likely to become chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said \"Whitaker and any nominee must commit\" to protecting Mueller and the independence of the Justice Department.\n\nThe timing is especially significant given that the new session of Congress with a Democrat-led House will not begin until Jan. 3, 2019.\n\nWe are \"not likely to have any meaningful congressional oversight in the next 60 days,\" said William Heffernan, law professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\nWhen Democrats do assume control of the House, they will also take leadership positions in the House committees \u2014 including the House Judiciary Committee, where Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., currently serves as top Democrat.\n\nHe is expected to chair the committee, and Heffernan said that \"at that point, Nadler will surely subpoena Whitaker.\"\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Nadler urged immediate action. \"The firing of Jeff Sessions will be investigated and people will be held accountable. This must begin immediately, and if not, then a Democratic Congress will make this a priority in January,\" Nadler said.\n\nHouse minority leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called on Whitaker to recuse himself, citing \"his record of threats to undermine & weaken the Russia investigation.\"", "Baltimore, M.D., November 7, 2018 \u2013 Today, America's longest-running evening business broadcast, \"Nightly Business Report \u2013 Produced by CNBC,\" was awarded a 2018 Program Excellence Award by American Public Television (APT), the leading syndicator of high-quality, top-rated programming to the nation's public television stations.\n\n\n\nThe Program Excellence Award was given to only three programs this year as part of APT's annual Fall Marketplace event.

Cronos Group added 8.4 percent.\n\n\"You're happy if you're long the cannabis stocks. He was the biggest roadblock to broadening that out to a national conversation,\" said Art Hogan, B. Riley FBR chief market strategist.\n\nSessions, a longtime opponent of attempts to legalize marijuana, lifted an Obama-era policy (known as the Cole Memo) earlier this year that kept federal authorities from cracking down on the pot trade in states where the drug is legal. The former attorney general opted to leave the decision on what to do when state rules conflict with federal drug laws in the hands of prosecutors.\n\nA new Attorney General \"could cut either way. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memo and has opposed legalization. Yet the Justice Department under his leadership has not done anything to go after cannabis in states that have legalized,\" Vivien Azer, a marijuana analyst at Cowen, wrote Wednesday.\n\n\"The President can be very unconventional in his selections. Obvious choices like Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn would be negative for cannabis as the senator is a cannabis opponent,\" Azer added. \"Yet the President could opt for an unconventional pick. Either way, the best case scenario is a continuation of a lack a Justice Department action.\"\n\nSessions's resignation comes after Michiganders on Tuesday chose to authorize the legalization of possession, use and cultivation of marijuana products by those who are at least 21 years old. Individuals will now be permitted to possess and use marijuana and marijuana-infused edibles and grow up to 12 marijuana plants for personal consumption. The approved law will impose a 10-ounce limit for marijuana kept at residences and mandate that amounts over 2.5 ounces be secured in locked containers.\n\nMarijuana proponents will also get relief from the the defeat of Rep.

Pete Sessions.\n\nThe PAC spent $2 million in support of Stevens and $1.4 million against Sessions, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Most of the PAC's funds in 2018 went toward TV and digital ads.\n\nDemocrats clinched the 218 House seats they needed to become the majority. There are at least 15 additional toss-up seats that have yet to be called.\n\nIn a press release on Wednesday, Bloomberg's chief spokesman, Stu Loeser, said the former New York City mayor spent more than $110 million to elect Democrats this year.\n\nBloomberg celebrated the victory by taking aim at President Donald Trump's administration.\n\n\"By winning the House, Democrats can now serve as a bulwark against a White House that has shown no respect for the rule of law - and no interest in bringing the country together.\" Bloomberg said in a statement. \"The Democrats' gains demonstrate that the American people want Congress to stand up to a reckless, divisive president - and to work across the aisle to tackle tough issues. Millions of Americans poured their hearts into the campaign to retake the House - and I was proud to be a part of the effort. We can do better in America today, and we must start now,\" he added.\n\nThere was one investment that didn't pan out for Bloomberg and that was his $20 million contribution to the Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC intended to help Democrats make inroads in the U.S. Senate.\n\nDemocrats so far have lost at least three Senate seats to Republicans: Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly, Missouri lawmaker Claire McCaskill and one-term Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida called for a recount after NBC News projected that his race with the state's former governor, Rick Scott, was too close to call. Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester was named the apparent winner by NBC News on Wednesday.\n\nDemocrats picked up one seat in Nevada as U.S. Rep. Jacky Rosen is the projected winner over Republican incumbent Sen.

Saudi Arabia, de facto leader of OPEC, and Russia had agreed to raise production ahead of U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil, and the joint committee could decide to recommend lowering production.\n\nThe committee could make a recommendation that would be acted on at OPEC's December meeting. Reuters quoted sources saying OPEC and its allies could not rule out a return to production cuts next year.\n\nHelima Croft, head of RBC global commodities strategy, said there's been increasing talk that OPEC and Russia are concerned about supply and may want to cut because they front loaded production ahead of U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil, which went into effect Monday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had called on Saudi Arabia to use its surplus capacity to add oil to the market ahead of the sanctions. Trump this week said he didn't want the Iran sanctions to drive oil prices higher. \"If you're the Saudis and you are concerned, you have to figure out how far you can let this go,\" Croft said. \"They did all of Trump's heavy lifting for him. They rushed in to put all the barrels on the market in anticipation of a U.S. policy.\"\n\nU.S. production has surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia. Analysts say Russian production is about 11.4 million barrels a day, and Saudi Arabia production is up to abut 10.7 million barrels, after it upped production to compensate for the potential of Iran barrels coming off the market.\n\nPrior to early October, oil prices had been rising as Venezuela supply continued to dwindle and Iranian barrels came off the market. West Texas Intermediate crude futures topped out at $76.90 in early October. Croft estimates there are about 1 million barrels of Iranian oil removed from the market daily.\n\nCroft said the market has been overly negative about supply, and is underestimating the effect of U.S. sanctions because the U.S. granted some buyers of Iranian crude exemptions. For instance, China has a waiver allowing it to temporarily purchase 360,000 barrels of Iranian oil. But China is cutting back its purchases, while analysts had expected China to continue buying Iranian oil and even add to its purchases.\n\nJohn Kilduff, partner with Again Capital, said he expects OPEC to take some action to stem a possible new supply glut, now that the U.S. election is over.\n\n\"Some in OPEC are blaming Russia and Saudi Arabia for a $15 fall in the oil price and are calling on them to cut production by 1 million barrels a day immediately, \" said Kilduff. \"There's going to be some fireworks at this meeting. The price fall over the last four weeks has been so swift and dramatic that it's definitely getting their attention.\"", "Samsung just announced a smartphone that can fold in half.\n\nIt's a compelling form factor that may one day allow us to carry phones that fit snugly in our pockets but that can then be unfolded to reveal a larger screen, like a tablet.\n\nThe phone, which doesn't have a final name or design yet, uses a new display technology Samsung calls the Infinity Flex Display.\n\nThe foldable phone was finally revealed during the Samsung Developer Conference 2018 Opening Keynote on Wednesday. The company's head of mobile, DJ Koh, has been teasing this sort of device for several years and most recently spoke with CNBC about it in September.\n\nSamsung won't be the only one to release a foldable phone.\n\nGoogle on Wednesday said that Android now officially supports foldable devices. While Samsung is one of its partners that will release a product first, it's likely other companies will quickly follow with similar products.\n\n\"You can think of the device as both a phone and a tablet,\" Google Android's vice president of engineering, Dave Burke, said during the Android Dev Summit on Wednesday, according to prepared remarks sent to CNBC. \"You can simply unfold the device to get a larger tablet-sized screen.

When you start regulating, a lot of bad things can happen. But I would certainly talk to the Democrats if they want to do that. And I think they do want to do that.\"\n\nCongress has been debating potential regulations of Facebook, Twitter and Google since the 2016 election, when foreign governments attempted to influence the results through divisive posts on various social media platforms. Several tech executives, including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey have testified as to how they're handling the ongoing risks of election meddling.\n\nSenator Mark Warner, D-Va., has proposed several options to regulate social media companies and stop the spread of disinformation, including enacting privacy regulations, similar to those being imposed in Europe.\n\nHowever, Trump warned it would be a balancing act between protecting free speech and finding adequate legal boundaries for social media companies. The president has said that social media companies are biased against conservative users and voices.\n\n\"I think it's a serious problem,\" Trump said. \"At the same time, you start getting into speech.

But it would \"be excited to develop fast, sustainable and affordable public transportation options for San Francisco,\" the company spokesperson says.\n\nOn Nov. 3, Musk tweeted a video showing The Boring Company's progress.\n\nThough Musk often features his tunneling venture \u2014 and the associated branded paraphernalia he's sold \u2014 on his Twitter account, he has said the majority of his time is spent working on Tesla and SpaceX.\n\n\"The Boring Company, to be clear, it's like literally 2 percent of my time. It's probably 20 percent of my tweets, but tweets do not correlate to actual time spent. I sort of just have fun with The Boring Company,\" said Musk at the South by Southwest tech conference in Austin, Texas, in March.\n\nMusk would actually have preferred that another entrepreneur take on tunneling.\n\n\"It's not because of some epiphany that I had one day driving on the 405,\" he says, referring to a famously congested highway in Los Angeles. \"That's how it gets translated somehow.

Jon Tester is the apparent winner in his bid for a third term, fending off a strong challenge from Republican Matt Rosendale, NBC News reported.\n\nNBC News made the call Wednesday afternoon. The race had been too close to call on election night. Tester survived despite voting no on Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court. Decisions to vote against the judge doomed some of his red-state Democratic colleagues.\n\nTester's apparent victory over Rosendale, Montana's state auditor, came despite the surprise move last week by long-shot Libertarian Party nominee Rick Breckenridge to throw his support to the GOP candidate.\n\nThe 62-year-old Tester's apparent win would be seen as a rebuke to President Donald Trump. Trump, in his 2016 presidential campaign, had won 50 out of Montana's 56 counties.\n\nThe president also singled out Tester, a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee member, for harsh criticism after the senator helped scuttle the nomination of Trump's personal physician, Dr. Ronny Jackson, as secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nBut Democrats in Montana painted Rosendale as a carpetbagger, calling him \"Maryland Matt.\"\n\nRosendale, a Baltimore native and real estate developer, moved to Montana only 16 years ago, while Tester is a third-generation resident of the state.\n\nTester's apparent victory was announced as Trump was giving a White House news conference.

Morgan Chase strategist Marko Kolanovic sees equities rallying into the end of the year, with investors gaining the most from riskier asset classes such as small-cap stocks.\n\n\"We still think that the market will move higher into the year-end, and investors may have to participate on the upside (appropriate exposures may be high-beta indices such as Russell 2000 and MSCI Emerging Markets),\" Kolanovic said in a note published Wednesday.\n\n\"We believe (out of consensus) that a split Congress is the best outcome for US and global equity markets,\" the quantitative analyst said in the note. \"As the President cannot count on Congress or the Fed for more easing, he will need to do what is in his power to keep the economy rolling \u2014 drop the damaging trade war and turn it into a winning deal.\"\n\nKolanovic, whose calls have been market-moving in the past, cited a litany of other reasons besides the election for the rally, including a decline in volatility easing, \"systematic\" selling, increased buyback activity and strong earnings.\n\nThe Russell 2000, an index made up of companies with small market valuations, is up just 2.3 percent for the year. The index lost most of its gains for the year in October, when the Russell 2000 plunged 10.9 percent in its worst month since September 2011. The MSCI Emerging Markets has fared even worse this year, falling 14.4 percent.\n\nKolanovic reiterated a call he made last week \"that many investors are positioned for a 'rolling bear market' and are exposed to the risk of a 'rolling short squeeze' into year-end.\"\n\nJ.P. Morgan expects that, after the October market sell-off and the continued economic slowdown in China, \"progress on the trade war is more, rather than less, likely,\" Kolanovic said.\n\n\"While the fuel for the sell-off was systematic flows, low liquidity and HF deleveraging, the catalyst was politics. It was essentially a miscalculation and a conflict between the US Administration and Fed going into important midterm elections,\" Kolanovic said.\n\nWith that miscalculation behind the market, Kolanovic said, the sentiment should remain positive through the end of the year.", "Humor can be a sure-fire way to get remembered on the job hunt.

The central bank has raised the federal funds rate eight times since December 2015 as a booming economy warranted a move away from crisis-response policy.\n\nHowever, factors outside of the Fed have also pushed yields to their highest levels since 2011, said Boockvar.\n\n\"I expect higher rates to commence outside of Italy and the European bond markets as the European Central Bank is done with their QE. I expect higher rates in Japan as they allow a steeper yield curve,\" Boockvar said.\n\nThe ECB has said it would end its massive bond-buying quantitative easing program in December, eliminating billions of dollars in fiscal stimulus from the global market. The Bank of Japan, too, has tapered some of its own stimulating bond purchases.\n\nThe loss of bond-buying monetary stimulus then lowers demand and pushes prices down and yields higher. Yields move inversely to bond prices.\n\nOn top of that, U.S. bonds do not look as appealing to domestic and international investors, said Boockvar.\n\n\"We have already a huge amount of Treasury supply that I think is overwhelming buyers, we have Japanese and European investors that are not buying U.S. Treasurys because the cost of hedging out that currency has completely wiped out any spread pickup so it's not all for good reason that I expect higher interest rates,\" he said.\n\nBoockvar's forecast of a 3.5 percent to 3.75 percent yield on the 10-year Treasury note would mark its highest level since early 2011.

If a transaction does happen, it's expected to be announced in December, two of the people said.\n\nXilinx, which has a market valuation of more than $22 billion, has largely watched from the sidelines as its rivals and peers in the semiconductor industry have consolidated. Xilinx has been frequently speculated as a target for a larger chipmaker, especially after Intel acquired Altera in 2015.\n\nXilinx, like Altera (now named Intel PSG), makes field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chips that are in used in circuit boards in data centers that run search algorithms and power artificial intelligence. Ross Freeman, the co-founder of Xilinx, invented the FPGA in 1984.\n\nMellanox, which has a market cap around $5 billion, sells networking hardware used in data centers, including Ethernet switches, where Cisco rules the market, and cables for connecting switches to other hardware. Buying the company would give Xilinx a broader array of products to sell into the data center market.\n\nMellanox reached a settlement with activist investor Starboard Value earlier this year that placed three new directors on its board.\n\nCNBC first reported on Oct. 25 that Mellanox had hired a financial adviser to seek a sale after receiving takeover interest. Analysts at Piper Jaffray named Xilinx, Intel and Broadcom as three potential buyers in an Oct. 26 note.\n\nSources told CNBC that parties other than Xilinx may be interested in Mellanox. But as Piper Jaffray notes, Intel is still searching for a permanent CEO and Broadcom just closed its $19 billion acquisition of CA Technologies this week.\n\nMellanox had soared more than 22 percent since Oct. 25 to about $88 per share, and rose nearly 6 percent to $94 after this report published on Wednesday. If a deal takes place, a takeover price could top $100, valuing Mellanox at about $5.5 billion, two of the people said.\n\nXilinx and Barclays declined comment.\n\n--CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.", "Trump calls CNN's Jim Acosta a 'rude, terrible person'\n\n12:28 PM ET Wed, 7 Nov 2018\n\nPresident Donald Trump comments on the midterm elections after Republicans held control of the Senate and Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.", "Square\u2019s gone from one extreme to another, and that\u2019s bullish, top technical analyst says 4:24 PM ET Tue, 6 Nov 2018 | 02:18\n\nSquare heads into its earnings report Wednesday with some healthy year-to-date gains to its name.\n\nThe payments stock has rallied close to 140 percent since the beginning of 2018.\n\nBut a rough October lopped off nearly 20 percent from its peak price at the beginning of the month. Its decline looks like a bullish signal to leading technical analyst Craig Johnson.\n\n\"I look at this chart, and I would be a buyer of this stock in here,\" Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Jaffray, said on CNBC's \"Trading Nation\" on Tuesday. \"We've pulled right back to identifiable support at the longer-term uptrend support line and also the rising 40-week moving average, so I like what I'm seeing here technically.\"\n\nSquare retreated to $65 a share twice in October only to bounce back up to $80. Its stock plummeted 26 percent in October, its worst month since May 2016, but has already clawed back 13 percent in gains this month.\n\nWhile Michael Binger, president of Gradient Investments, sees opportunity in the financial technology space, he is doubtful Square is the right pick.\n\n\"We really like this industry, the financial payments and transaction processing area, [but] I wouldn't own Square right now,\" Binger told \"Trading Nation\" on Tuesday. \"It's not a cheap stock; they've had a couple of really good quarters. The bar is set pretty high right now, and they need to do almost 90 percent year-over-year revenue growth.\"\n\nSquare trades at 113 times forward earnings, making it far more expensive than its peers relative to its earnings power. Competitors such as PayPal trade at a more moderate 31 times forward earnings.\n\n\"We think you have better risk-reward in those other companies \u2014 PayPal, Visa, Mastercard,\" added Binger.\n\nPayPal has added 20 percent in 2018, Visa is up 26 percent, and Mastercard has gained 36 percent.", "Some meetings at top tech companies start with a half hour of silence. It turns out, these companies might be onto something.\n\nVersions of these \"silent meetings\" are held by companies such as Amazon, LinkedIn and Square. Experts say this approach can lead to better meeting preparation and more succinct discussions. This tactic can even give people who are typically talked over a unique chance to be heard \u2014 including women, people of color, remote workers and introverts.\n\nEach company approaches the silent meeting in its own unique way. At Amazon, six-page memos are prepared ahead of most business decisions to give every stakeholder the same level of understanding. Meeting participants won't speak until everyone has finished reading, usually after around 30 minutes have passed. In an annual Amazon shareholder letter, Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos called this quiet time \"study hall.\"\n\nAt Square, silent meetings begin with the group silently reviewing a Google Doc and using the commenting feature to ask and answer questions. This process takes around 30 minutes and helps the team identify key points that need to be discussed in person for a short, focused conversation, explains Square software engineer Pierre-Yves Ricau in a Medium post. The process, he says, gives \"everyone a chance to be heard.\"\n\nThis method was brought to Square by former Amazon exec Alyssa Henry who was struck by research suggesting that some groups get talked over in meetings. This leads to a lose-lose situation where some people are disempowered, other people get talked over and the best ideas don't get heard, according to Henry. It's all usually unintentional, but \"it sucks\" all the same, she writes.\n\nUsing a Google Doc to track comments, questions and answers invites everyone, even people who didn't attend the meeting in person, to participate. \"I want a culture where it's not the loudest voice heard, or the most politically adept, or the most local to [San Francisco], but the most right,\" says Henry, who leads product management and engineering for Square's products for sellers, such as point of sale systems. \"I want a breadth of thought \u2014 and debate.\"\n\nRicau said the first silent meeting he experienced did feel strange, but quickly realized the group got more done in the same amount of time as a traditional meeting.\n\nSquare CEO Jack Dorsey agrees, and tweeted in support of the meeting style.\n\nLinkedIn executives have also dabbled with silent meetings, reserving the first five or 10 minutes of some meetings to pre-read materials that will be discussed, according to a 2015 post by Brian Rumao, LinkedIn's chief of staff to the CEO. This cuts down on the amount of time spent talking about slides, he writes.\n\nThis approach doesn't make sense for every type of meeting, execs say. \"Demo days and experience walk-throughs are a couple of examples where it doesn't make sense,\" Henry tells CNBC Make It. The silent meeting format is used instead for strategic planning and decision-making meetings, and most quarterly operating reviews, she says.\n\nAt LinkedIn, the practice isn't used for all meetings, either. Rumao says it's an effective way to kick off certain types of discussions, like strategy and product reviews. \"It's a great way to ensure everyone has shared context on the content before we dive in,\" Rumao tells CNBC Make It.\n\nRenee Cullinan, CEO and co-founder of collaboration consulting firm Stop Meeting Like This, says silent meetings can be beneficial for three reasons.\n\nSetting aside time to read and think at the beginning of a meeting stresses the value of focus to a team. It also builds preparation time into the team's day.\n\nThe practice also recognizes that there are many types of thinkers, Cullinan points out. Some colleagues might think by talking an idea out while others might prefer to collect their ideas before speaking.\n\n\"One could argue that [other people will be] more thoughtful when they finally do talk, but in a traditional meeting, they won't have the opportunity,\" she says. \"By the time they're ready to speak, the meeting's over.\"\n\nLastly, Cullinan says, reading the right type of written communication can prompt strategic thinking. With Amazon's six-page memos, for instance, the author has been asked to put forth a particular point of view and show more detail and critical thinking than the typical PowerPoint might require.\n\nThese methods, \"force a quality of thinking,\" Cullinan says.\n\nLike this story?

The expansion would mean potentially thousands of poor Americans gaining access to health-care coverage.\n\nShares of UnitedHealth Group and Humana were up more than 4 percent in intraday trading Wednesday. Anthem's stock was soaring more than 5 percent.\n\nMore Americans with health coverage was also seen as boding well for hospitals. Shares of hospital stocks HCA Healthcare and Tenet Healthcare were higher midmorning Wednesday.\n\n\"Coverage won last night,\" Benjamin Isgur, a director of the Health Research Institute, told CNBC. With Democrats taking control of the House, \"there probably won't be some major policy change in terms of the current health-care policy we have going in the system.\"\n\nHealth care emerged as a key issue this year, with 41 percent of voters saying it was their No. 1 concern in the election, followed by immigration, the economy and gun control, according to an NBC News exit poll.\n\nDemocrats, who pushed a health-care message during midterms, flipped enough seats to take the House majority away from Republicans in Tuesday's election. Republicans, however, kept control of the Senate and added seats.\n\nIsgur expects Democrats taking the House likely will slow, but not stop, the Republican Party's pursuit of their health-care agenda, which he said has focused on recasting the role of the federal government in the U.S. health industry.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and the Republican Party have threatened to repeal the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, and GOP lawmakers have cited budget concerns due to increased enrollment in federal health programs.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans have pledged to bring down high health-care costs in the U.S. but are divided on how to do so.\n\nMatt Borsch, health-care analyst at BMO Capital, said he expects a \"mixed\" outcome for Medicaid expansion. He said offsetting outcomes include the election of GOP governors in Florida and Georgia who are both against Medicaid expansion.\n\nWATCH: This is what Medicare does and doesn't cover", "The midterm election produced a big win for Disney and the Seminole Tribe of Florida, which owns the Hard Rock brand. According to Ballotopedia, Disney spent more than $20 million and the Seminole tribe spent more than $24 million to support Amendment 3 on the Florida ballot, known as the anti-casinos initiative.\n\nThe amendment makes it much harder for a gaming company to build a new casino in Florida. Lobbyists and legislators wouldn't have a say. Casinos could only be approved by a statewide ballot \u2014 which would mean voters in Pensacola would have a voice over whether a casino gets built in Miami.\n\nWhy were Disney and Hard Rock so vested in this measure? It staves off competition. For Hard Rock that competition would be for gambling dollars, since this amendment doesn't apply to casino gambling on Native American tribal lands. And for Disney, it means less competition for tourism dollars, and Disney has a vested interest in presenting Florida as a family-friendly vacation destination.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins opposed the measure and urged fans on Twitter to vote against it. The NFL team argued the amendment will block the possibility of legalizing sports betting in Florida. That's not clear; the amendment applies to card games, casino games and slot machines. But in other states \u2014 where sports gambling is now legal \u2014 a casino toehold is a first step to a sports book.\n\nThe Florida legislature has not moved forward with various gambling initiatives in recent years. If gaming opportunities are to expand significantly in Florida, it will be because Florida voters prove they have more gumption for gambling than lawmakers.\n\nFlorida voters also passed an amendment to ban betting on dog races, a measure spearheaded by animal rights activists.\n\nMeanwhile, a dog track will be the big beneficiary of a new casino license in Arkansas. Voters in that state passed a measure to award casino licenses in four separate counties. Two will go to existing facilities, Southland Racing Corporation in Crittenden County, a greyhound track, and Oaklawn Jockey Club in Garland County, a horse track.\n\nBut that leaves two openings for other applicants to win casino licenses, in Jefferson County within two miles of Pine Bluff and in Pope County within two miles of Russellville. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson opposed the measure and maintains his negative outlook but has said he will respect the will of the voters.\n\nIn Maryland, casino revenue coming in from the state's six casinos is forecast to reach half a billion dollars by 2022. That money has long been promised for school funding. But voters approved a \"casino lockbox\" measure on Election Day that carries with it a requirement to use those gambling tax revenues on top of current minimum funding requirements. Previously, the state used the casino revenues to meet existing funding requirements.\n\nIdaho rejected a measure that would allow instant horse racing video terminals. Gov. Butch Otter had supported the measure, hoping to prop up Idaho's \"diminished horse racing industry.\" But opponents prevailed, arguing it essentially legalized gambling off-reservation.\n\nIn Missouri, voters narrowly passed a measure to boost bingo in the state by easing restrictions on who can run the games. The state has legalized bingo run by nonprofits, veterans groups and the like, but insisted a person had to be a member of a sponsor group for two years to run the games.\n\nThis measure reduces the required membership to six months. The Missouri Gaming Commission says charitable bingo games have added $100 million in tax revenue to the state's education fund since the game was legally allowed in 1980.", "The battle in Congress over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh had consequences that reached far beyond the high court bench, Republicans say.\n\nSenior GOP lawmakers said Wednesday that the politically fraught road to then-nominee Kavanaugh's confirmation galvanized Republicans to show up at the polls for the midterm elections.\n\nSens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., both credited the so-called Kavanaugh effect for Republican victories in key Senate races against red-state Democrats.\n\nGraham, in a thread of tweets Wednesday morning, said that the constituents of those Democratic incumbents who voted against Kavanaugh \"held them responsible for being part of a despicable smear campaign orchestrated by the left.\"\n\nThe \"#KavanaughEffect,\" Graham said, should be renamed \"#KavanaughsRevenge.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader McConnell, speaking to reporters about the midterms Wednesday on Capitol Hill, said the Kavanaugh effect was \"very helpful.\"\n\nRepublicans in critical states for the party were \"highly offended\" by the Democrats' conduct during the confirmation proceedings, McConnell said, and the fallout from the process acted \"like an adrenaline shot\" for GOP turnout.\n\nMultiple Democratic senators in purple or red states who voted against confirming Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court lost their seats Tuesday night.\n\nSen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, who lost to GOP challenger Kevin Cramer, said when she announced her \"no\" vote that if she were making a purely political decision, \"I certainly would be deciding the other way.\"\n\nAfter initially completing his confirmation hearings before the Senate, Kavanaugh was accused of sexual misconduct in decades-old incidents by multiple women. Kavanaugh categorically denied the claims and vowed to defend himself under oath before the Judiciary Committee once more.\n\nSome Democrats called for his resignation over the allegations, while many Republicans \u2014 especially Graham \u2014 leaped to the nominee's defense and launched fiery attacks on Democrats.\n\n\"This is going to destroy the ability of good people to come forward because of this crap,\" Graham told Democrats at the time. \"If this is the new norm, you better watch out for your nominees.\"\n\nDan Judy, Republican pollster and vice president of North Star Opinion, said, \"The fight over Justice Kavanaugh brought the stakes of this election into stark relief, and helped get Republicans motivated behind Senate candidates in ways they weren't before.\"\n\nJudy added that \"opposing Kavanaugh exposed a number of Democrats who were claiming centrist records in very conservative states.\"\n\nBarbara Kittridge, founder of progressive strategy group Motive, said, \"The 'hangover' from the Kavanaugh hearings certainly impacted both Senate and also House races.\"\n\nKittridge added, however, that the contentious hearings \"clearly drove away female suburban voters from the GOP and that cost them the House. The gender gap is too significant to be ignored.\"\n\nDemocratic Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, who called the allegations against Kavanaugh \"disturbing and credible,\" was also unseated Tuesday night by Republican Mike Braun.\n\nAnother vulnerable Senate Democrat who voted against Kavanaugh's confirmation, Bill Nelson of Florida, was still locked in a race that was too close to call by Wednesday at noon ET, according to NBC News projections.\n\nAfter McConnell and Graham made their remarks Wednesday, NBC News reported that Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of red-state Montana was the apparent winner of his race against Republican Matt Rosendale. Tester had also voted against Kavanaugh.\n\nIn the wake of the midterms, Graham and McConnell both noted that Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia, which went heavily for President Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, had voted \"yes\" on Kavanaugh and was re-elected.", "Views on overall household finances also split along party lines, with 69 percent saying they had seen no change over the past two years. Just 21 percent of Democrats noted improvement against 77 percent of Republicans. That conflicts with findings from Evercore ISI, which said this week that research shows the average household has seen a $363 monthly gain in disposal income this year, $85 of which has come from reductions in income tax withholding.\n\nThe tax question will be coming up again when the new Congress takes over in January.\n\nTrump and the GOP leadership have tossed out the possibility of a \"Tax Cut 2.0\" proposal that would more closely target middle-income families. Democrats, though, are likely to balk and instead look at ways to plug the widening deficit, with any future big spending plans aimed at infrastructure rather than taxes.\n\n\"We expect no major tax legislation to become law under a divided Congress,\" Alec Phillips, an economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a note. \"Our projections of the growth impulse from fiscal policy assume no substantial tax changes will be enacted over the next few years, and the election result should not change this assumption.\"\n\nPhillips said House Democrats may want to adjust the tax cuts already in place toward lower-income earners, and even could look at repealing the corporate tax rate decrease. Those plans, though, likely would die in the Senate, which remains in Republican control.\n\nInfrastructure, on the other hand, represents some common ground between Trump and the expected Democratic leadership. Spending on roads, bridges and transportation and other public works projects \"over time can boost U.S. productivity growth, thus managing a smoother transition from the current tax-cuts fueled expansion to a more sustainable pace of growth in the years ahead,\" said Lena Komileva, chief economist at G+ Economics.\n\n\"But, even if cross-party agreement can be reached, infrastructure spending carries a long lifespan from planning to return on investment,\" she added.\n\nEven if the two sides can hammer out an aggressive infrastructure bill, which would be the final step in Trump's three-pronged approach that also includes lower taxes and less regulation, the earlier steps taken likely will remain largely untouched, according to the initial unofficial consensus following the midterms.\n\n\"Donald Trump's economic policies will remain intact,\" said Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments. \"He won't get new initiatives passed in the House, but Trump's tax cuts and deregulation are good for at least another two years.\"\n\nWATCH: Here's what voters really cared about.", "Trump: Nancy Pelosi and I can work together and get a lot done 1:33 PM ET Wed, 7 Nov 2018 | 06:05\n\nPresident Donald Trump said at a White House press conference Wednesday he hopes to work with congressional Democrats on issues ranging from infrastructure to drug pricing.\n\n\"Hopefully we can all work together next year to continue delivering for the American people, including on economic growth, infrastructure, trade, lowering the cost of prescription drugs,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president's comments came a day after the 2018 midterm elections, which saw the Democrats take back the House and Republicans holding their majority in the Senate.\n\n\"The Democrats will come to us with a plan for infrastructure, a plan for health care, a plan for whatever they're looking at and we'll negotiate,\" the president said.\n\n\"We have a lot of things in common on infrastructure,\" Trump added. \"We want to do something on health care, they want to do something on health care, there are a lot of great things we could do together.\" The president also noted that there could be bipartisan support for more regulation of drug pricing.\n\n\"I expect [the Democrats] will come up with some fantastic ideas that I can support on the environment, on so many different things including prescription drug prices which we've put a big dent in already,\" the president said.\n\nInfrastructure could be one of a few areas of partnership between Democrats and Republicans, with members of both parties calling for improvements to the country's aging bridges, roads and airports. Ever since Trump announced his bid for the White House, he has lambasted what he's categorized as \"horrible infrastructure problems\" throughout the United States.\n\nIndustrials and materials stock rallied earlier in the day after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he could see teamwork between the parties.\n\n\"The one issue that Leader Pelosi and I discussed this morning, where there could be a possible bipartisan agreement, would be something on infrastructure,\" McConnell told reporters, referring to Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who is in line to regain the House speakership.\n\nWall Street appeared to agree, with shares of major machinery manufacturers, equipment lenders and construction companies rallying sharply following the midterm results. Shares of Vulcan Materials, which produces gravel, crushed stone and sand, jumped 6.3 percent; United Rentals climbed 1.8 percent; and industrials giant Caterpillar added 2.9 percent.\n\nStocks of major drugmakers Pfizer, Merck and Johnson & Johnson held their gains after Trump's comments.\n\n\"Since his earliest days as a candidate, Trump, a world traveler, cited the deplorable condition of the U.S. infrastructure compared to nations around the world,\" wrote Tom Block, Washington policy strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors. \"From airports to bridges, the U.S. has one of the world's oldest infrastructures, and public works programs like this have always been a central principle of Democratic policy.\"\n\nThe Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF, which measures the performance of a slew of materials equities, rose 1.1 percent Wednesday. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF also gained 1 percent.", "Match Group shares plunged 17 percent on Wednesday after the company gave fourth-quarter revenue guidance that missed estimates, and spooked investors.\n\nThe company, which owns several dating services including Tinder and Match.com, said after the bell on Tuesday that it expects revenue between $440 million and $450 million for the quarter that ends in December. Analysts were estimating $454 million in revenue, according to data from Refinitiv.\n\nMatch Group attributed its weak forecast to a strong U.S. dollar, and impacts from the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) privacy law.\n\nHowever, the company's third-quarter earnings and revenue results beat estimates. Match reported earnings of 39 cents per share on $443.9 million in revenue, while Wall Street expected earnings of 36 cents per share on $438.1 million in revenue, according to data from Refinitiv.

But the outcome stopped short of the \"blue wave\" victory that many Democrats had been hoping for.\n\nWith the Republicans retaining control of the Senate, the mixed verdict reflected the deep divide in the American electorate.\n\nRepublicans retained their House seats in blue-collar and rural districts where President Donald Trump's aggressive talk on immigration played well. But Democrats wrested control of seats from the GOP in suburban districts where college-educated voters rejected Trump's warnings of a migrant \"invasion.\"\n\nA record number of women ran for Congress, many of them Democrats.

In suburban areas where key House races were decided, female voters skewed significantly toward Democrats by a nearly 10-point margin.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, some 14 races were too close to call, leaving the Democrats holding a 28-seat majority. Democrats have won 222 and the Republicans 199, with winners undetermined in 14 races, according to NBC News.\n\nThe road to a House majority ran through a few dozen districts that included suburban regions that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Democrats flipped seats in suburban districts outside of Washington, Philadelphia, Miami, Chicago and Denver.

According to the 2018 Global Wealth Report from Credit Suisse Research Institute, you don't even need six figures.\n\nA net worth of $93,170 U.S. is enough to make you richer than 90 percent of people around the world, Credit Suisse reports. The institute defines net worth, or \"wealth,\" as \"the value of financial assets plus real assets (principally housing) owned by households, minus their debts.\"\n\nMore than 102 million people in America are in the 10 percent worldwide, Credit Suisse reports, far more than from any other country.\n\nYou need significantly less to be among the global 50 percent: If you have just $4,210 to your name, you're still richer than half of the world's residents.

Sales have remained elusive as fewer customers are buying pizzas from the chain and franchisees have been torn between the old regime and the new one.\n\nWhile same-store sales were not as poor as expected, they were still down nearly 10 percent in the quarter, raising questions about if Papa John's can really initiate a turnaround or if an acquisition is the best route to recoup losses.\n\n\"Papa John's posted another eventful quarter, while challenges clearly remain, there were some encouraging signs as sales trends improved late in the quarter,\" Peter Saleh, analyst at BTIG, wrote in a research note Wednesday. \"The improvement and positive commentary on October supports a better sales outlook for [fourth quarter 2018] and into 2019, though we are not convinced the concept is out of the woods quite yet.\"\n\nThe pizza chain's sales improved in September over the previous two months, the company said in releasing its third-quarter earnings Tuesday.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is poised to replace GOP Rep. Devin Nunes as the head of the Intelligence Committee, said on the eve of the elections that among his top priorities as chairman would be reviving the panel's probe of Russian meddling during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nIn a slew of tweets Wednesday morning, Trump took credit for the GOP's successes in the midterms and vowed to retaliate against potential investigative efforts against him by Democrats in the House.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is scheduled to speak after Trump's remarks on Wednesday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters earlier, \"We had a very good day. I'm proud of what's happened. The president was very helpful to us.\"\n\nThe president had doggedly supported many key races in the midterms, regularly tweeting out endorsements for swaths of House and Senate candidates and traveling across the country to host dozens of raucous rallies in the weeks leading up to Election Day.\n\nHis attacks against Democrats, often inaccurate, were even more aggressive.\n\nTrump accused Democrats writ large of pining for a socialist takeover of the country in an attempt to reshape America in the image of Venezuela. He latched onto a caravan of mostly Honduran migrants traveling to seek asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border in service of his argument that \"open borders\" Democrats posed a national security threat. And he repeatedly attacked individual Democratic candidates with incendiary language, calling Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum a \"thief\" without evidence and saying California Rep. Maxine Waters, one of Trump's most ardent critics in Congress, was a \"low IQ\" person.\n\nThe president also kept up his attacks on the media throughout the election cycle. On the morning after Election Day, Trump said for \"any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election, just remember two words - FAKE NEWS!\"", "We can now get on with the other market worries, says Jim Cramer 4:24 PM ET Wed, 7 Nov 2018 | 03:17\n\nThe stock market could be primed for \"the rallies of all rallies\" now that the midterm election uncertainty is finally over, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Wednesday.\n\nHowever, that huge pop could only materialize if the Federal Reserve under Chair Jerome Powell decides to pause its interest rate hikes, said the \"Mad Money\" host.\n\n\"If there's anyway, anyway that Jay Powell says, 'You know what, we got to wait and see,' we could have the rallies of all rallies,\" Cramer said on \"Squawk Box.\" \"But he has to green light us.\"\n\nU.S. stocks were sharply higher Wednesday after the results from Tuesday's election came in about as expected, lifting a cloud of uncertainty hanging over the market.\n\nIn the midterms, Democrats flipped enough seats to take the House majority from Republicans. However, the GOP was expected to keep control of the Senate and add seats.\n\nLater Wednesday on \"Squawk on the Street,\" Cramer said the market \"can get on with other worries.\"\n\nCramer has been critical of Powell, agreeing with President Donald Trump, but for different reasons, that rate increases should be halted.\n\nThe Fed began its two-day November meeting Wednesday, with a rate decision set for Thursday afternoon. No change is expected this time around. But another hike is projected after central bankers meet in December. The Fed has already raised rates three times this year.\n\nLast month, Powell said the cost of borrowing money was a long way from so-called neutral, sparking concerns about a more aggressive Fed tightening that led to October being the worst month for the S&P 500 since September 2011.\n\nSo far this month, as of Tuesday's close, the S&P 500 was off to a much better November.", "Antimicrobial resistance is a large and growing problem, with the potential for enormous health and economic consequences for the United States and the rest of the world. According to a new OECD report, released Wednesday, superbug infections could cost the lives of about 2.4 million people in North America, Europe and Australia over the next 30 years unless more is done to stem antibiotic resistance.\n\nOn average, about 29,500 persons die each year in the United States from infections related to eight resistant bacteria. By 2050 it is estimated that antimicrobial resistance will kill about 1 million people in the United States.\n\nThe economic toll of this superbug crisis is huge: In the United States alone the health-care costs dealing with antimicrobial resistance could reach $65 billion by 2050, according to the OECD report. That is more than the flu, HIV and tuberculosis. If projections are correct, resistance to backup antibiotics will be 70 percent higher in 2030 compared to 2005 in OECD countries. In the same period, resistance to third-line treatments will double across EU countries.\n\nThe bottom line: Between 2015 and 2050, antimicrobial resistance would cost about $3.5 billion per year to the health-care services of the 33 countries included in the analysis. The impact on quality of life, measured through disability-adjusted life years, will be even larger, with up to 1 out of every 232 individuals losing one year of life in good health because of antimicrobial resistance in the OECD countries.\n\nEarlier this year, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned it had detected 221 strains of a rare breed of \"nightmare bacteria.\" This bacteria is virtually untreatable by antibiotics and have special genes that enable them to spread their resistance to other germs. Nightmare bacteria is particularly deadly in the elderly and people with chronic illnesses. The probability of developing a resistant infection is also significantly higher for children up to 12 months of age, and men are also more likely to develop resistant infections than women. Nearly half of the resulting infections prove fatal.", "Hundreds of billions of dollars could be put toward health-care costs every year if a tax was applied to red and processed meat, Oxford University researchers said Wednesday.\n\nA new study from the U.K. university said introducing a health tax on such products would offset health-care costs and prevent more than 220,000 deaths a year globally.\n\nLooking into optimal taxation levels for red and processed meats in nearly 150 countries and regions, researchers concluded that in high-income countries, red meat prices would need to be increased by more than 20 percent, while processed meats would need to more than double in price.\n\nAt those levels, the tax would collect $172 billion per year globally, covering 70 percent of the health care costs associated with their consumption. To fully cover those costs, the tax would need to be doubled.\n\nResearchers estimated that in 2020, 2.4 million global deaths will be attributable to the consumption of red and processed meat \u2014 as well as a $285 billion health-care bill.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, beef, lamb and pork are carcinogenic when eaten in processed forms, and possibly still carcinogenic when consumed unprocessed. The organization also links them to coronary heart disease, strokes and type 2 diabetes.\n\nAs well as offsetting health-care costs, researchers said their proposed tax could lead to a 16 percent decline in the global consumption of processed meat. Reducing the consumption of processed meat would also have a positive effect on climate change by reducing global greenhouse gas emissions by over 100 million tons, it said.\n\nMarco Springmann, who led the study, said an overconsumption of red and processed meat had a negative economic impact on many countries.\n\n\"I hope that governments will consider introducing a health levy on red and processed meat as part of a range of measures to make healthy and sustainable decision-making easier for consumers,\" he said in a press release Wednesday.\n\n\"Nobody wants governments to tell people what they can and can't eat. However, our findings make it clear that the consumption of red and processed meat has a cost, not just to people's health and to the planet, but also to the health care systems and the economy.\"\n\nHowever, Carrie Ruxton, a public health nutritionist and dietitian, argued that meat consumption had already seen a significant decline in the U.K., adding that red meat provided valuable nutrients to diets.\n\n\"A tax on red meat would be a retrograde step, both for overall diet quality in women and girls and for health inequalities,\" she said in a statement emailed to CNBC.\n\n\"There is no high-quality evidence linking red and processed meat with heart disease, stroke or diabetes, and a risk of bowel cancer only applies when weekly intakes exceed 700g. As few people in the U.K. are at this level of consumption, a general meat tax would be like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.\"\n\nChris Mallon, chief executive of the U.K.'s National Beef Association, told CNBC in an email: \"A general meat tax would be an excessive over reaction. Chronic disease prevention would be far more effective if it focused on smoking, excess drinking, and body weight rather than a single food source like meat, which brings many nutritional benefits.\"\n\nResearchers who worked on the study likened their proposed tax to levies on other products that damage consumers' health, such as tobacco, alcohol and sugar. However, with different laws in different jurisdictions a global meat tax would prove very hard to implement.\n\nIn recent years, several nations and states have introduced taxes on sugary soft drinks in an attempt to curb burdens on health systems.\n\nThe U.K. introduced a tax on high-sugar soft drinks in 2016, while efforts are being made in California to push through a levy on sugary sodas. While the United Nations has explicitly encouraged the adoption of such taxes, the repealing of a sugar tax in Cook County, Illinois, last year could slow efforts in other cities.\n\nWATCH: Inside the San Francisco lab growing meat in a petri dish", "Former UK leader Blair: Brexit either pointless or painful 10:48 AM ET Wed, 7 Nov 2018 | 01:28\n\nThe former leader of the United Kingdom, Tony Blair, has told an audience in Lisbon that there is still time to stop a Brexit that will only either be \"pointless or painful.\"\n\nBritain is due to leave the European Union in less than five months, although negotiators representing Britain and the EU have so far failed to agree the terms of withdrawal.\n\nBlair has long opposed Britain's departure from the economic and political bloc and told a Web Summit 2018 audience on Wednesday \"up to the very end, I am going to do everything I possibly can to stop it.\"\n\nThe former leader, who led the Labour party which is now in opposition, then outlined how he saw Brexit failing.\n\nFirst, Blair claimed that U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May's deal is going to lead to a parliamentary defeat and that then would trigger either a General Election, a fresh Brexit referendum, or a \"no deal\" where the U.K. crashes out of the EU and reverts to WTO rules for trade.\n\nDismissing the last option, Blair then claimed the ruling Conservative Party would be \"suicidal\" to go the polls.\n\n\"Let's assume they're not, they won't want an election.

And we need a healthy Washington Post in this country. And so we are delighted to see it growing again,\" he said.\n\nBut the Times is different, he said.\n\n\"Washington Post is still a significantly smaller paper than the New York Times, and another paper owned by a billionaire, the Wall Street Journal, another very fine paper owned by a billionaire [Rupert Murdoch] is...is also smaller.\"\n\nIn order to protect the business, The New York Times Company has a dual-class share structure: Class A shares are publicly traded and widely held (with a nearly $4.5 billion market cap), while the Ochs-Sulzberger family holds a controlling interest of the Class B shares (that do not trade publicly), which entitles them to elect 70 percent of the board, according to the Times. (The company did take a $250 million loan from Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa in 2009 and paid it back in 2011.)\n\nWhat the Times would do with a billion-dollar infusion from a wealthy titan is \"an interesting question in the abstract,\" Sulzberger told Swisher, but he still demurred, saying, \"We cannot just be reliant on the altruism of people.... We're going to have to make that billion dollars ourselves.\"\n\nThe Times' strategy to be a sustainable business is \"to make stuff that's worth paying for.

On Nov. 1, Mark Thompson, president and chief executive officer of The New York Times Company, said that for the third quarter, subscription revenues accounted for nearly two-thirds of the company's revenues.\n\nSulzberger also told Swisher more money would not change the quality of the journalism the publication is producing.\n\n\"I do not think for a second that the ownership structure of the New York Times is somehow hindering our ability to invest in great journalism. The last year we've expanded our Washington bureau, we've expanded our tech coverage. \u2026 We've expanded our business coverage,\" Sulzberger says to Swisher.\n\n\"Point to me where someone has just thrown a ton of money at the journalism problem, just thrown a ton of money and it's worked out well.\"\n\nPlus, said the publisher, the paper does not want even the appearance of bias.\n\n\"The thing that makes the New York Times special, the thing that I think distinguishes us from almost any other news organization, not any, but among a handful of news organizations, is its independence.

The appointments, Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell has said, are his \"top priority.\"\n\nNow, unleashed by a decisive Republican victory in the Senate in Tuesday's midterm elections, the president's ability to shape the ideological makeup of the federal judiciary has only increased.\n\nTo be sure, it's impossible to predict how a judge will rule simply based on the party they belong to, or the party of the president who appoints them. But an ideologically conservative federal bench could prove useful to the president as he pursues an agenda that has often ended up in the courts.\n\n\"They are the ones that judge all your disputes,\" Trump said during a speech in Ohio earlier this year. \"They judge on what's fair on the environment and what's not fair. Where they're going to take your farms and factories away and where they're not.\"\n\nIt's a lesson Trump has learned firsthand. In his first days in office, U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly, an Obama appointee, struck down the first iteration of his travel ban. A later version of the ban was later halted from going into effect via rulings from two other Obama appointees sitting in Maryland and Hawaii.\n\nA third version of the ban was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court in a landmark 5-4 ruling along party lines.\n\nThe Trump administration's antipathy toward the lower courts, which have blocked the president's policies not only on immigration but also on transgender rights, the environment and other matters, has led it to bypass the appeals courts entirely with unusual frequency and go straight to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe 9th Circuit, headquartered in San Francisco, has been the primary target of the president's ire. That court currently has six vacancies.\n\n\"It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts,\" Trump wrote in a January post on Twitter.\n\nEven if the president fills all of the vacancies on the 29-member court, however, the majority of its judges would still be Democratic appointees. The president is likely to have more luck with other circuits.\n\nBoth the Atlanta-based 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and the Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit appear most likely to flip to a majority of Republican-appointed judges. The 3rd Circuit currently has a 7-6 Democratic majority, according to Reuters. In the 11th, the split is an even 6-6.\n\nThe Republican victory on Tuesday could deliver an even bigger prize to the president.\n\nThe two oldest judges on the Supreme Court are the liberal Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 85, and Stephen Breyer, 80.

That tied the survey's second lowest reading in its history.\n\nThe data are a sharp turnaround from last spring, when confidence in the U.S. housing market was soaring, mortgage rates were relatively low and the economy was flying high.\n\nFewer consumers now expect home prices to rise, echoing other surveys that have shown a drop in the number of people who think owning a home is currently a good investment. Home prices are still gaining, but those increases have been shrinking each month: They've fallen below 6 percent annually for the first time in a year, according to the much-watched S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home price index.\n\nHousing sentiment has been falling for the past several months, despite the fact that more consumers think the economy is on the right track. That component of the survey reached a new high.\n\n\"The contrast between the survey's findings of weak homebuying sentiment and overall economic optimism mirrors what we're seeing in the broader economy,\" said Doug Duncan, senior vice president and chief economist at Fannie Mae. \"While economic growth posted the fastest back-to-back pace in four years in the third quarter, residential investment declined for the third consecutive quarter, a first for the current expansion.\"\n\nFewer people now believe mortgage rates will fall back to recent lows.

In the past decade alone, the percentage of costs to GDP has risen roughly 10 percent.\n\nAmericans spend twice as much as any other high-income country in the world on medical care.\n\nYet utilization rates in the United States were largely similar to those in other nations, according to a recent academic paper published by the Journal of the American Medical Association.

We teach them sex education, geography, math, reading, all kinds of learning skills, but we don't tell them about debt.

(They analyzed data at various ages using multiple nationally representative surveys.)\n\nAmong boomers with positive balances, the median savings was around $200,000.

Together, Benioff and Salesforce contributed more than $7 million to support the proposal, which could cost Salesforce up to $10 million in additional taxes a year.\n\nOn the other side, Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey spoke out against Prop C, as did the CEO of payments company Stripe and the founder of Zynga, Mark Pincus. Lyft, venture capitalist Michael Moritz and Y Combinator's Paul Graham all donated at least $100,000 to the \"No on Prop C\" campaign, too.\n\nCritics of the proposition argued that it lacked proper accountability and oversight, and would unfairly affect financial services companies like Square. Outside the tech industry, San Francisco Mayor London Breed and state Sen. Scott Wiener opposed the measure as well.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the election, the measure became a point of tension in a city where tech-fueled wealth stands in stark contrast with the human suffering on display on its sidewalks.\n\nOverall, more than 7,000 people experience homelessness in San Francisco.

Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee, emerged on the national stage as the politically polarized panel battled over its probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nDemocrats were projected to take over the House in Tuesday's midterm elections, likely elevating Schiff to the chairman spot in the intelligence panel, which had been headed by one of President Donald Trump's biggest protectors, Rep. Devin Nunes.\n\nLike Mueller's ongoing investigation, the House Intelligence Committee's probe included inquiring about the potential links \"between Russia and individuals associated with political campaigns.\"\n\nThrough the investigation, which began days after Trump's inauguration in January 2017, Schiff also became a leading critic of his Republican counterpart: Nunes.\n\nSchiff had called on Nunes to recuse himself from the House investigation in March 2017, following reports that the California Republican had received intelligence from a source at the White House the day before he briefed Trump on possible surveillance of his communications by U.S. intelligence.\n\nAnd after the committee released its final report from the probe in April 2018 asserting \"no evidence\" of collusion between Trump and Russia, the Democratic minority led by Schiff vowed to continue investigating.\n\nWhile stumping for a fellow California Democrat on Monday, Schiff said that reviving and expanding the House Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russian meddling would be his top priority, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nHe also told the Times he planned to look into whether Russia held leverage over Trump's financial interests through the president's business empire. \"The president has sought to keep that off limits, but if that's the leverage Russians pose that's a real threat to our country,\" Schiff told the newspaper.\n\nSchiff has already been on the receiving end of Trump's ire.

Excluding one-time items, the retailer earned $1.27 a share, better than the $1.10 expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.\n\nTotal revenue rose 9.3 percent to $1.25 billion, slightly missing analysts' average estimate for $1.26 billion.\n\nThe company has been trying to cut back excess inventory at its stores in Europe, where rival brands like LVMH and Kering have gained in popularity.\n\nBut that strategy came back to haunt Kors in the latest quarter. CEO John Idol said on an earnings call that sales were lower because the company didn't have enough inventory of its logo bags. He said the logo category, which accounts for about 25 percent of sales, has been gaining in popularity faster than anticipated, and Kors is still \"sold out in certain styles.\"\n\nSome analysts also say Kors' product offering isn't as \"sophisticated\" as other luxury retailers, including Coach-owner Tapestry in the U.S. Its handbags can be found scattered across off-price retailers like TJ Maxx and Marshalls, getting lost in a \"sea of stuff,\" GlobalData Retail managing director Neil Saunders said.\n\nIdol said Kors' recently announced plans to acquire Versace are \"setting the stage for accelerated revenue and earnings growth\" as the company still tries to gain a footing in Europe. The company announced the $2.1 billion deal in September. After the deal closes, Kors will also be changing its name to Capri Holdings.\n\nKors has said it plans to grow Versace to $2 billion in revenue globally and increase the brand's retail presence from roughly 200 to 300 stores. It also expects to expand accessories and footwear from 35 percent to 60 percent of revenue.\n\nDuring the latest quarter, the Jimmy Choo brand \u2014 which Kors acquired last November \u2014 delivered stronger-than-anticipated sales thanks to strength in footwear, according to the company. Because of this, Kors raised its adjusted earnings per share outlook for the fiscal year by 5 cents to a range of $4.95 to $5.05. It still expects total revenue to be about $5.13 billion, with same-store sales being down in the low single digits.\n\nAs of Tuesday's close, Kors shares had fallen about 8 percent this year.", "Controversial Republican Rep.

A paralegal and former minor league baseball player, Scholten received more than $1 million in last-minute donations after a poll revealed that King could be more vulnerable to defeat in the conservative district than since his first election to Congress.\n\nFor years, King has made comments seen as racist and anti-immigrant, including a tweet in support of two anti-Islam European politicians that said, \"Cultural suicide by demographic transformation must end.\"\n\nLast month, King tweeted an endorsement of far-right Toronto mayoral candidate Faith Goldy, who has been interviewed on a podcast hosted by the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer.\n\nThen, The Washington Post revealed that King had \"met with members of a far-right Austrian party with historical Nazi ties during a European trip financed by a Holocaust memorial group.\"\n\nThe revelations led several companies \u2014 Land O'Lakes, Purina and Intel \u2014 said they would no longer contribute money to King.\n\nAnd Rep.

The White House has already slapped tariffs on more than $200 billion in Chinese goods,and could levy duties on an additional $257 billion in imports.\n\nOutside of trade, the president could seek to find common ground with Democrats on issues such as immigration, drug prices and infrastructure. Still, they have failed to reach a consensus on those policy areas so far during Trump's presidency.\n\nAnd then there's the question of how vigorously House Democrats led by Trump nemesis Nancy Pelosi will pursue investigations of the president and members of his administration. The president tried to deter Democrats on Wednesday morning, contending that his administration \"will likewise be forced to consider investigating them\" for what he claims are \"leaks of Classified Information, and much else at the Senate level\" if House panels probe his conduct.\n\nHe threatened: \"Two can play that game!\"\n\nStay tuned.", "The Muslim world's workforce is changing fast\n\n6:35 AM ET Wed, 7 Nov 2018\n\nMore than 50 million women have entered the workforce in Muslim-majority countries since the year 2000.

The real estate industry, including major landlords operating in California, led the fight against the measure by donating significant amounts of money.\n\nA PAC affiliated with the California Association of Realtors contributed about $8 million to fight the ballot measure while more than $5 million apiece came from New York-based real estate private equity firm Blackstone Property Partners, Chicago-based apartment real estate investment trust Equity Residential, and Essex Property Trust, a California-based real estate investment trust.\n\nThe proponents of Proposition 10 received most of their money from Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a nonprofit organization which donated about $23.2 million. Michael Weinstein, president of the foundation, helped lead the effort to get the voter measure on the November ballot.\n\nThe ballot measure sought to repeal California's Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, a state law enacted in 1995 that weakened municipal rent control ordinances.

Now, one Southeast Asian city-state is putting the tech to work in reshaping its energy industry.\n\nIn Singapore, companies can buy and sell so-called renewable energy certificates (RECs) that represent a unit of green energy production from the likes of wind or solar power. The idea is that firms seeking to offset their non-green energy production can purchase RECs from a company producing excess green power.\n\nIt's a system similar to carbon trading that takes place in many localities, and, as of last week, companies can now engage in their REC trading on a blockchain-powered system.\n\nThat's more than just a gimmick, according to utilities provider SP Group, which launched the new platform: It will allow for better transparency and lower costs in power trading because it reduces the need for a centralized entity to verify transactions. It could eventually even facilitate cross-border energy credit trading, the utility company has said.\n\n\"A consumer in Singapore who wishes to buy green energy can now, through blockchain-powered REC trading, purchase a REC from a hydro-producer based in Laos,\" SP Group CEO Wong Kim Yin told CNBC at the Singapore International Energy Week conference last week. \"This reduces the cost, reduces the friction in the market.\"\n\nHigh costs in verifying certificates as well as the difficulties in tracking RECs have led to relatively low trading volumes in Singapore, and even so, a majority of the transactions occur directly between one originator and buyer \u2014 not on a marketplace.\n\nAdding blockchain to the equation may change that: The distributed ledger system effectively eliminates the need for verification processes at a centralized entity, reducing costs and allowing small energy consumers and producers to participate.\n\nWong spoke of a future in which energy trading is more decentralized, driven by technology and where consumers are empowered to make sustainable energy choices.\n\n\"In the past, you have big power stations in the centralized model and you would transmit power to the households. In the future you would have solar panels and you would have batteries. In that model the power system would be a lot more robust,\" Wong said.\n\nGreen energy options are limited with land constraints in the city-state, meaning large-scale construction of wind farms isn't an option. Solar panels, which are installed on surfaces, are also a function of land area, as well as the residential and commercial build-up.\n\nInnovations like floating solar energy panels on reservoirs, which are currently being tested in Singapore, could help alleviate the spatial constraints of land, but the potential extent of such technology remains a question.\n\nAs a result, experts expect that demand will continue to outstrip supply in Singapore in the near future. Lars Kvale, managing director at APX, which is an issuer of RECs globally, told CNBC that \"there is significant demand for renewable energy in Singapore but a limited amount of renewable energy capacity to meet all of the demand.\"\n\nBlockchain could unlock some of that potential through matching cross-border demand and supply.\n\n\"The true promise of blockchain and distributed ledger technology in the context of environmental commodity platforms is allowing these platforms to establish trusted relationships with upstream information sources without having to revalidate it,\" Kvale added.\n\nSP Group owns and operates electricity and gas transmission and distribution businesses in Singapore and Australia, as well as district cooling businesses in Singapore and China.\n\nWATCH: Here's why every industry should be looking at blockchain", "Republican Rep.

That government-led plan seeks to integrate several cities in the region \u2014 including Macau, Hong Kong and Guangzhou \u2014 into a giant engine for economic growth.\n\nJust last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping opened a bridge connecting Macau, Hong Kong and Zhuhai, a city in Guangdong province. That new link, experts have projected, could boost the number of tourists visiting the region.\n\nWith that, and other investments set for the 11-city region, Murren said Macau \"has the potential to be a much larger market.\"\n\nDespite that projection, Macau has seen significantly slower growth in its gaming revenues over the last two months. Murren told CNBC's Akiko Fujita, however, that's to be expected.\n\n\"We've been in Macau for many years now and we've seen a very volatile market in terms of (gaming revenue) growth,\" he said.\n\nIn some cases, the changing fortunes are due to \"self-imposed\" measures, such as when the Chinese government reduces the number of visas for people entering the city. Another factor he mentioned was September's Typhoon Mangkhut, which temporarily shuttered casinos.\n\n\"There's no doubt we're going to see volatility in the monthly numbers,\" he said.\n\nMacau's growth could also get hit by the ongoing trade tensions between China and the U.S., Murren acknowledged, but he described that geopolitical issue as \"a small piece of the puzzle.\"\n\n\"It's still the largest gaming market in the world. It will always be that, in my opinion,\" he said.\n\nMGM Resorts International has two properties in Macau: MGM Macau and the recently opened MGM Cotai.", "A congressman who has boasted of his qualifications to lead impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump appears set to take control of the House of Representatives committee entrusted with the power to do just that.\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., was elected by members of his party to become the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee in July. His campaign materials characterized him as the \"strongest member to lead a potential impeachment.\"\n\nNow, with the lower chamber swinging to the Democrats, Nadler is likely to become the committee's chairman. The panel is traditionally the one that recommends for or against drawing up articles of impeachment. If the House votes to impeach, the Senate is responsible for conducting the trial.\n\nNadler first earned Trump's ire in the 1980s by opposing his Manhattan real estate developments. He has been relentless in his opposition to the president while in Congress.\n\nTo be sure, Nadler has shied away from overtly calling for impeachment. Last year, he told The New York Times that he didn't \"relish having a constitutional crisis.\"\n\n\"My view of impeachment is to be very careful about impeachment,\" he told The New Yorker in February.\n\nNadler has been more forthcoming about another area his committee would investigate if Democrats took control. In October, he said the he would launch an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct and perjury lobbed at Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n\"It is not something we are eager to do,\" Nadler told The New York Times. \"But the Senate having failed to do its proper constitutionally mandated job of advise and consent, we are going to have to do something to provide a check and balance, to protect the rule of law and to protect the legitimacy of one of our most important institutions.\"\n\nKavanaugh has denied any wrongdoing, and only one Supreme Court justice has ever been impeached.\n\nWATCH: How to impeach the President of the United States", "Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux was locked in a tight race with incumbent Republican Rob Woodall for Georgia's 7th Congressional District.\n\nNBC News retracted its earlier call that said Bourdeaux had won, due to a data entry error.\n\nBourdeaux, a former aide to Sen.

But the incumbent, whose father John Sununu also served as governor, was strongly favored to win this year.\n\nWhile polls of the race routinely put Sununu ahead of Kelly by double digits, the gap between the two narrowed as the election neared. On the eve of the vote, a University of New Hampshire poll found that an 11-point gap favoring Sununu in October had evaporated in just one month.\n\nKelly, a former state senator, ran on a liberal platform promising to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, slap new regulations on business to protect workers, and reinstate net neutrality. Sununu, on the other hand, has called himself a supporter of President Donald Trump \u2014 although he has criticized Trump as governor of a state that narrowly voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nDemocrats are eager to seize back as much power as possible after that election, when Republicans took control of the White House, both houses of Congress and the majority of governors.\n\nMany of the gubernatorial elections were viewed as proxies for voters' feelings about Trump, whose polarizing brand of politics appeared to galvanize turnout on both sides of the aisle compared with previous election cycles.\n\nNew Hampshire and Vermont are the only two states where governors face re-election every two years.

Only 11 percent of those unhappy with Trump voted Republican.\n\nIn part, that's because Pelosi bested Trump in shaping the campaign dialogue. Her personal standing mattered less to voters, but her agenda mattered more.\n\nAs expected, GOP candidates dominated among the 22 percent of voters who identified the robust American economy as their top issue. They also dominated among the 23 percent who named immigration, which Trump hammered relentlessly down the campaign homestretch.\n\nBut more voters by far \u2014 42 percent \u2014 identified Pelosi's signature health-care issue as their top priority.

She is likely to become the chairwoman of the panel following the GOP's loss of the lower chamber in the midterm elections.\n\nWaters has called for increased regulation of the nation's major banks, a position at odds with the deregulatory agenda of President Donald Trump and his allies in Congress. Last fall, the committee's Democrats, under Waters' leadership, issued a report calling for Wells Fargo to shut its doors for good following a number of high-profile scandals.\n\nAnd in July, during in an interview with John Harwood atCNBC's Capital Exchange event in Washington, the 14-term House member from California pledged higher fines for financial institutions that flout the law.\n\nIt is unlikely that Democrats will be able to usher in any major regulation without a majority in the Senate, or while Trump is president.

That puts formal legalization on track for December.\n\nUtah and Missouri passed measures on Tuesday to provide access to medical marijuana.\n\nSixty-six percent of Americans now support legalizing marijuana, according to the latest Gallup poll. That's a record high and was the third consecutive year that support for legalization has increased to record levels. A 2008 ballot initiative made Michigan the 13th state to legalize cannabis for medical use.\n\nEarlier this year, Vermont joined a growing list of states allowing recreational use, Oklahoma voters in June overcame late opposition to overwhelmingly approve medical use and New York State health officials told Gov. Andrew Cuomo this summer that \"the positive effects of regulating an adult marijuana market in NYS outweigh the potential negative impacts.\"\n\nTen states and the District of Columbia have now approved recreational use of pot.

McCaskill, like other Democrats seeking re-election in Trump states, searched for middle ground on the question of working with the president.\n\nPolls showed the Missouri race as a toss-up before the election. Nearly $55 million in outside spending poured into the race, according to the latest reports, in addition to almost $40 million that the candidates each raised.\n\nHawley's tenure as Missouri's attorney general was brief and chaotic, and it eventually emerged as a campaign issue. But the situation in his office was largely overshadowed by a national agenda that took center stage in the race, including issues like tariffs, immigration and Justice Brett Kavanaugh's controversial confirmation to the Supreme Court.\n\nOn health care, Hawley was party to a lawsuit that would unravel the Affordable Care Act, including its protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

Democrats, meanwhile, considered Finkenauer to be among their party's strongest recruits this cycle.\n\nDuring her campaign, Finkenauer argued that Trump's trade policies had hurt Iowa farmers, and she portrayed Blum as a rubber stamp for the president's policies.\n\nFinkenauer led in polls throughout the campaign. While this was due in part to her overall strength as a candidate, it also reflected the structural and financial advantages she held over Blum.

Chuck Schumer if Democrats were to regain the majority in the Senate.\n\nImmigration was a major factor in the race, especially as Trump railed about a caravan of migrants from Central America, located deep in Mexico but headed to the U.S. border.\n\nBredesen said in an interview with MSNBC's Kasie Hunt that it was \"beyond belief\" that anyone would label the caravan \"as some sort of threat,\" to the United States.\n\nBlackburn stuck with the president's hard line. She recently published an op-ed arguing that the caravan was tantamount to an invasion and a threat to the nation's security.\n\nMillions of dollars in advertising money poured into the race. Billionaire and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg hosted a fundraiser for Bredesen recently in Manhattan.\n\nOutside groups spent just over $50 million on the race, including $7 million against Blackburn by a super PAC aligned with Schumer, and $13 million from the Senate Leadership Fund versus Bredesen.\n\nThe SLF is a super PAC backed by former associates of Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.", "Watch Nancy Pelosi speak after Democrats take back the House 9:44 AM ET Wed, 7 Nov 2018 | 02:06\n\nResults of Tuesday's midterm elections are still coming in.\n\nDemocrats will win the House and Republicans will hold onto their majority in the Senate, NBC News projects.\n\nDespite some early gains in their bid to win a House majority, Democrats missed some opportunities for a potential wave election.\n\nStock futures rose slightly in overnight trading as the split Congress scenario widely expected by investors played out.

Tammy Baldwin won her re-election bid in Wisconsin, defeating Republican Leah Vukmir in Tuesday's election, according to an NBC News projection.\n\nThe race attracted national attention and brought President Donald Trump to the Badger State in the final weeks to stump for Vukmir.\n\nIn recent months, Baldwin \u2014 a one-term liberal Democrat and the nation's first openly gay U.S. senator \u2014 had been leading Vukmir in polling by double digits and enjoyed a money advantage. Baldwin spent about seven times as much as her conservative Republican challenger and raised more than $27 million compared with Vukmir's roughly $3 million haul as of Oct. 17.\n\nHealth care was a key issue, with both candidates promising to protect people with pre-existing conditions but disagreeing on the extent of government involvement in health plans and the role of private insurance companies. The two also disagreed on Trump's trade policies, which have led to tit-for-tat tariffs against some of Wisconsin's key industries such as agriculture and manufacturing, including Harley-Davidson motorcycles.\n\nAt a Wisconsin rally with Trump just a few weeks ago, Vukmir \u2014 a state senator and nurse \u2014 called Baldwin's health plan \"chaos for all because she wants to destroy and dismantle Medicare.\" A few days later, former President Barack Obama stopped in Wisconsin for a rally with Baldwin and skewered GOP leadership for considering cuts to Medicare and Social Security to get the federal deficit down.\n\nOn trade, Baldwin criticized the Trump administration's policies as \"haphazard\" since they didn't only target China but went after allies such as the European Union, Canada and Mexico and resulted in retaliatory tariff hitting Wisconsin's cheese sector and Milwaukee-based Harley-Davidson.\n\nVukmir, though, sided with Trump and said the president was negotiating better deals, beating China. She added that the Wisconsin farmers and manufacturers she's talked to were supportive of the administration's trade policies and were willing to wait for the benefits of Trump's aggressive moves.", "West Virginia Sen.

In August, the president descended on Charleston, the state's capital city, to deliver a ringing endorsement of Morrisey and a warning for those who considered voting for his opponent.\n\n\"If you vote for Joe Manchin or any other Democrat in November, you're voting for someone who wants to destroy the coal industry,\" Trump said, according to a report in the local press.\n\nManchin sought to downplay national issues and avoid the appearance of stymieing the president's agenda. In a dramatic gesture, Manchin voted to confirm the president's second nominee to the Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThe race earned immense national attention thanks to the specter of a Democrat representing one of the nation's most deeply conservative states.\n\nManchin was favored by public polling headed into the election, although Morrisey narrowed some of the gap in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n", "Republican businessman Mike Braun is projected to win his bid to unseat Democratic Sen.

President Donald Trump carried Indiana by nearly 19 points in 2016.\n\nDonnelly was hoping to stave off defeat by peeling off Republican suburban women dissatisfied with Trump's divisive politics, according to reports. His chances may have been hurt by his vote against the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nBraun, CEO and owner of Meyer Distributing, won the Republican primary by convincing voters that he was the most like Trump. He served in the Indiana House of Representatives from 2014 to 2017, resigning to focus on his Senate campaign.\n\nTrump endorsed and campaigned with Braun, attending a rally in August and tweeting his support: \"Will be going to Evansville, Indiana, tonight for a big crowd rally with Mike Braun, a very successful businessman who is campaigning to be Indiana's next U.S. Senator.\"", "Three-term Republican Rep.
