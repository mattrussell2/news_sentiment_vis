So, on Tuesday, he got technician Carolyn Boroden's take.\n\nAfter inspecting Apple's charts, Boroden, who runs FibonacciQueen.com and is Cramer's colleague at RealMoney.com, came out \"cautiously optimistic\" on the stock's near-term future, Cramer said Tuesday.\n\n\"Her diagnosis? She thinks that Apple could soon be ready to rebound, ... perhaps even climbing back to new highs,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\nShares of Apple have been under pressure since the company's earnings report last week, in which the iPhone maker announced that it would no longer break down individual product performance and issued softer-than-expected guidance. Apple's market cap has since slipped under the $1 trillion level.\n\nTo figure out where Apple's stock could go next, Boroden used the concept of symmetry. In her 31 years of technical analysis, she has noticed that stocks tend to follow patterns when they decline or rally. For example, if a stock tends to bottom after falling 10 basis points, there's a good chance it will bottom after future 10-point declines.\n\nOn Tuesday, she paired that with her other signature method: running a stocks past swings through Fibonacci ratios \u2014 numerical sequences that repeats throughout nature \u2014 to find key support and resistance levels for the stock.\n\n\"When you do this with Apple, you find two zones. There's a potential floor of support running from $196 to $198, and another one lower running from $186 to $192,\" Cramer said. \"If the rally in Apple is going to resume, Boroden says that, ideally, we want the stock to hold somewhere between that first floor of support.\"\n\nBoroden also used this method to find out when Apple's stock was likely to change course. She found five Fibonacci time cycles all coalescing this week, meaning Apple's stock could \"make an important low\" during the week, Cramer said.\n\n\"Apple has a powerful floor of support here. If that floor holds, Boroden believes the stock will quickly find its footing and go right back to rallying,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"As long as we don't violate the recent lows, she thinks Apple can potentially zoom to new highs \u2014 she thinks it could go to [the] $243 area.\"\n\nHowever, if Apple's stock trades below its floors of support, the technician warned her thesis would unravel.\n\n\"The bottom line? The charts, as interpreted by Carolyn Boroden, suggest that Apple might not have much more downside before it bottoms, and that, likely, it bottoms sometime this week and then starts climbing again,\" Cramer said. \"As for me, I think it's too hard to trade in and out.

That would result in congressional gridlock, which could spell trouble for President Donald Trump's agenda but be \"very good\" for stocks, Cramer said on \"Mad Money.\"\n\n\"This gridlock scenario results in a dramatically slower economy,\" he said. \"That's ... terrific for the highest-growth stocks that can keep putting up terrific numbers even during a slowdown. Think Amazon, Alphabet, the cloud plays, the cybersecurity stocks, and many of the ... semiconductor names like Broadcom and Qualcomm, which are tied to the rollout of 5G wireless technology, not the broader economy.\"\n\nA Democratic win could also benefit the biotechnology cohort, a historically Democrat-friendly counterpart to big pharma, Cramer said. He recommended the SPDR S&P Biotech exchange-traded fund for investors bullish on a blue wave.\n\nCramer said he could even see shares of Humana, CVS-Aetna and Cigna doing well in the case of a Democratic sweep on the prospect of better funding, and the stocks of health-care giants UnitedHealth Group and HCA doing well no matter what party took over.\n\nBut retail stocks could suffer if the Democrats land a victory as Trump's tax cuts fall into political jeopardy and tariffs and interest rates continue to climb, he warned.\n\n\"We've seen a tremendous rally in retail. [...] It could come to a truly screeching halt tomorrow,\" he said. \"I'd be very careful here. I bet many hedge funds would like to go long Amazon, which has been down, down, down, and go short all the retailers, which have been up, up, up.\"\n\nIf the Republican Party maintains control of Congress, Cramer offered a simple strategy: buy defense stocks like Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, all of which have declined on fears of a Democratic victory.\n\n\"While both parties love shelling out money for military hardware, the Republicans love it even more, so if they can hold both houses of Congress, I expect a roaring bull market in the defense stocks,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\nAll in all, Cramer saw secular growth stocks as the best possible investments regardless of the election's outcome. Gridlock or not, congressional Democrats likely won't have enough votes to stop Trump's trade war with China or change the Federal Reserve's plan for raising interest rates, creating a good environment for secular plays, he said.\n\n\"I wish there were more winners. But I keep coming back to the prospect that the president's tariffs automatically rise to 25 percent next year and the Fed tightens four more times to ensure that we get a lot of layoffs so there's less inflation,\" he said.\n\nThere could also be a scenario where investors come out of the woodwork after the election and start buying, in which case Cramer recommended employing his strategies in reverse.\n\n\"You take the stocks that I have said do well in a Democratic sweep or even a one-house win, and you sell them and you sell them hard. You can keep the Republican stocks, but don't overstay your welcome\" ahead of the looming G-20 talks and the December Fed meeting, which will likely bring another rate hike, he warned.\n\n\"Bottom line?

The minimum they need to gain for the majority is 23. It sees Republicans holding onto the Senate or maybe even adding a seat to bring their total to 52.\n\nIn the final forecast on Monday, Sabato and Managing Editor Kyle Kondik wrote, \"We have long cautioned against assuming the House was a done deal for the Democrats, and we don't think readers should be stunned if things go haywire for Democrats tomorrow night.\"\n\nHowever, they added that it may be just as likely, or even more likely, that they are underestimating the Democrats in the House.\n\nLast week, Kondik and Sabato pointed out that midterms often lead to a decline for the presidential party after a surge in the House in the presidential year. However, the GOP didn't enjoy a surge in 2016 and therefore it can limit its decline this year.\n\nFor the Senate, if Democrats win every race where they were currently favored, plus Indiana and Missouri, and one in North Dakota, Tennessee or Texas it is \"possible\" they can gain control, according to the latest Crystal Ball.", "Telecoms infrastructure company CommScope is nearing a deal to buy complementary telecom gear provider Arris for more than $31 a share, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nA deal would give CommScope more scale with a more diversified product base, while it would provide an exit for Arris as fewer customers watch traditional TV from set-top boxes, a major part of its business.\n\nThe all-cash transaction could be announced as soon as tomorrow, the people said, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.

Bucklew has argued that his execution, if carried out by lethal injection, would be cruel and unusual because he has a rare medical condition that would make the procedure excruciatingly painful.\n\nIn his questions to Missouri's attorney, Kavanaugh suggested he was sympathetic to that argument.\n\n\"Are you saying even if the method creates gruesome and brutal pain you can still do it because there's no alternative?\" Kavanaugh asked John Sauer, the state's solicitor general.\n\nSauer responded that under precedent set by the high court it would be necessary for the person set to be executed to offer an alternative method that reduced the pain.\n\n\"So you're saying that even if the method imposes gruesome, brutal pain, you can still go forward?\" Kavanaugh asked. \"Is there any limit on that?\"\n\nKavanaugh appeared to be testing the logic of a separate precedent established by the court in 2015.

Prices have lately been trading at highs going back to January as U.S. stockpiles of the fuel sit near the lowest levels in over a decade going into the winter season.\n\nOn Monday, natural gas prices rocketed another 8.6 percent higher. Prices hit a session peak of $3.58 per million British thermal units on Tuesday, the highest level since Jan. 29.\n\n\"There was a big change in the weather forecast. Not only did it turn colder but it turned much colder in some key heating regions,\" said Jen Snyder, director of RS Energy's gas market practice.\n\nOver the last few days, warm weather patterns broke down, giving way to forecasts that showed colder-than-normal temperatures taking hold throughout much of the country. Forecasts are now pointing to temperatures in mid-November that are more typical of the middle of December, with cold bursts expected in the Midwest, across Texas and the South and throughout New England.\n\n\"This is one of the largest weekend changes we've seen,\" said Jacob Meisel, chief weather analyst at Bespoke Weather Services. \"The order of magnitude of cold change caught everyone off guard.\"\n\nAnalysts say the run-up reflects concerns that natural gas held in underground storage throughout the country will run low toward the end of the winter, making it harder to deliver the commodity in some regions. To keep natural gas storage levels adequate during a cold winter, prices need to rise enough to incentivize drillers to increase production or force some consumers to turn to other fuel sources.\n\n\"What's really going on here is that the market is trying to protect the storage it has in the ground,\" said Meisel. \"As a result you're probably going to see strength across the basis market in areas that might not even get that cold.\"\n\n6-10 Day Temperature Outlook, source: National Weather Service\n\nNatural gas storage inventories are well below their five-year average after a warmer-than-usual August boosted air conditioning use and nuclear power plants closed during the recent hurricanes.\n\nDuring the summer, it looked like the United States would exit the winter with about 1.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in storage, said Snyder at RS Energy. It now appears those levels will be closer to 1.2 trillion-1.3 trillion cubic feet, and a cold winter could cut inventories by another 400 billion to 500 billion cubic feet.\n\nSnyder said this week's price spike is not necessarily surprising given how complacent the market had grown about low inventory levels.\n\n\"It seems like the market placed almost no value on storage this season just because we've seen such strong production growth,\" Snyder said.\n\nWhile U.S. natural gas production is indeed soaring, the country is also using more natural gas at power plants and industrial projects. The United States is also ramping up exports of liquefied natural gas, a form of the fuel chilled to its liquid state for shipment on giant seaborne tankers.\n\nIf the cold persists this fall and winter, natural gas prices could rise above $5 or $6 per mmBtu for weeks at a time, according to Snyder. Traders have not seen those price levels since the polar vortex that plunged the United States into extreme cold during the winter of 2014.\n\n\"It really depends on when it gets cold, which is why this cold snap is spooking the market,\" Snyder said. \"Early cold weather is going to have more of an impact than later cold weather.\"", "Demand has never been healthier for our brand and product, says Delta CEO 7:34 AM ET Thu, 11 Oct 2018 | 03:43\n\n\"It was so nasty, I had no way to adequately clean it up,\" he said.

The safety and health of our customers and employees is our top priority, and we are conducting a full investigation while following up with the right teams to prevent this from happening again. Upon landing in Miami, the aircraft was taken out of service to be deep cleaned and further disinfected.\"\n\nThat apology is not enough for Meehan. He wants Delta to explain why the flight crew failed to adequately respond to the situation when he first sat and stepped in the feces. For example, he says it took several passengers demanding the mess be cleaned up before a service crew came on board. Even then Meehan says the clean-up was not adequate.\n\n\"There was still feces in the carpet and feces under my seat. We took blankets to cover the floor and cover the seat,\" he said. Delta disputes that it failed to clean up the mess. It says the cleaning crew used disinfectant to clean the area on the floor and seats before the plane took off.\n\nMeehan says Delta has offered to compensate him with up to 50,000 frequent flyer miles and to pay for new shoes and a new suit. Meehan has not yet accepted Delta's offer. He says the airline owes him an explanation for how it mishandled the situation.\n\n\"I bought a plane ticket and you made me sit and fester in dog feces for two hours.

The market reaction to that scenario could be muted, but not so if there's an upset, with either party staging a surprise victory and gaining total control of Congress.\n\nStocks could rally if there's a GOP surge \u2014 or red wave \u2014 and some strategists see a sharp decline if Democrats overcome the odds and take both the House and Senate.\n\nKey early indicators of blue or red wave:\n\nKentucky \u2014 polls start closing at 6 p.m. ET\n\nIndiana \u2014 polls start closing at 6 p.m. ET\n\nVirginia \u2014 polls close at 7 p.m. ET\n\nFlorida \u2014 polls start closing at 7 p.m. ET\n\nFor that reason, investors are tuned in to the early races, which can't tell the whole story but could give clues to the broader outcome of the midterm elections. One of those races is being fought in the 6th District of Kentucky, where Amy McGrath, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel, is challenging GOP Rep. Andy Barr.\n\n\"It's going to be one of the first races [to close]. If she wins, it's very positive for Democrats. If he wins, it's not hugely negative, but it's not good for the Democrats. Kentucky is so Republican. This is in Lexington, where the University of Kentucky is. \u2026 There's a liberal area of Lexington, but there's the farm area outside,\" said Tom Block, Fundstrat Washington policy strategist.\n\nBlock said he will also be focused on Virginia, where Rep. Scott Taylor is defending his seat in the 2nd District against Elaine Luria, who, like Taylor, is a Navy veteran. In Virginia's 5th District, Republican Denver Riggleman is running a close race against Democrat Leslie Cockburn for a seat vacated by Rep. Tom Garrett, who is retiring. A third Virginia House seat is up for grabs in the 7th District, where Rep. Dave Brat is running against former CIA operative Abigail Spanberger in a close race for a seat that has been in GOP hands for decades.\n\n\"Between Kentucky and the two or three Virginia races, if the Republicans are winning them all, it means they could hold the House,\" said Block.", "A pair of charts suggests stocks will stage a significant rally, no matter what happens with the midterm elections.\n\nAccording to J.P.

The S&P, which fell almost 7 percent in October, is up more than 2 percent in the last week.\n\n\"The general idea for now: The curve is not inverted yet, so we'll treat the pullback as a late-cycle correction and not the start of a bear market,\" Hunter said.", "An ex-J.P.

Edmonds spent 13 years at New York-based J.P.

He and others routinely placed orders that were quickly cancelled before the trades were executed, a price-distorting practice known as spoofing.\n\n\"For years, John Edmonds engaged in a sophisticated scheme to manipulate the market for precious metals futures contracts for his own gain by placing orders that were never intended to be executed,\" Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski said in the release.\n\nOf note for J.P. Morgan, the world's biggest investment bank by revenue: Edmonds, a relatively junior employee with the title of vice president, said that he learned this practice from more senior traders and that his supervisors at the firm knew of his actions.\n\nFurther, Edmond's case stemmed from an \"ongoing investigation\" run by the FBI's New York field office, the Justice Department said.\n\nEdmonds pleaded guilty under a charging document known as an \"information.\" Prosecutors routinely use them to charge defendants who have agreed to cooperate with an ongoing investigation of other people or entities.\n\nHis sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 19.

Shares of the company rose more than 3 percent in aftermarket trading Tuesday.\n\nHere's what analysts polled by Refinitiv expect:\n\nAdjusted earnings per share: 20 cents vs 22 cents\n\nRevenue: $364 million vs. $393.7 million\n\nOverall same-store sales: down 9.8 percent vs. down 10.7, according to StreetAccount\n\nPapa John's has been thrown into turmoil since its public feud with former CEO and Chairman John Schnatter broke in July. Sales have tanked, traffic is down and franchisees have been divided, some siding with Schnatter, others with the company and the rest caught between the two.\n\nThe company lost $13 million, or 41 cents a share, during the third quarter, compared with a profit of $21.8 million, or 60 cents a share, during the same period last year, the company said after the market closed Tuesday. After adjusting for certain items, the company earned 20 cents a share while analysts expected 22 cents a share, according to average estimates compiled by Refinitiv.\n\nThe company excluded $24.8 million in special charges from its adjusted earnings that included $3.6 million in costs to remove Schnatter's image from its marketing materials and $9.9 million in financial assistance to its franchise owners.\n\nThe company generated $364 million in revenue, down 15.7 percent from $431.7 million during the same time last year \u2013 missing analysts' estimates of $393.7 million.\n\n\"During the quarter, we took important actions resulting in improved consumer sentiment and North America comp sales that were slightly ahead of expectations,\" Steve Ritchie, CEO of Papa John's, said in a statement Tuesday. \"While the operating environment remains challenging, these early indicators combined with our strong cash flow give us confidence in the consumer initiatives underway across the Company.\"\n\nThe company's same-store sales were a bright spot in otherwise disappointing earnings. Same-store sales in the quarter fell 9.8 percent across all North American locations, better than the decrease of 10.7 percent analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.\n\nCompany-owned locations saw same-store sales fall more 13.2 percent, steeper than the 11.8 percent analysts had expected according to StreetAccount. Its franchised locations, however, fared better than expectations, posting same-store sales that were down 8.6 percent, better than the 10.5 percent drop that was forecast.\n\nRitchie said that sales in September showed improvement over July and August, in part because of its new \"Voices\" ad campaign. It replaced Schnatter's image, which has long been central to the company's marketing and signage, with the other faces from within the company.\n\nRitchie told analysts the company had a \"strong positive response\" to the new campaign.\n\n\"Employees and franchisees express their appreciation for shedding a light on the real values and people who make up our company,\" he said on a conference call Tuesday. \"Customers also responded positively which shows that the strategy to move in the new more modern and inclusive marketing direction is the right one.\"\n\nHe said YouGov Brand Index shows the consumer sentiment toward the company is shifting \"from largely negative to neutral or positive.\"", "It has been a record-breaking season for women in politics.\n\nFirst, a record number of women filed to run for office.

Readers can also scan the product images in the catalog with their Amazon App to get more information and add them to their shopping cart.\n\nThe move is Amazon's latest in following the playbook of traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. The e-commerce giant started opening physical bookstores and convenience stores in recent years, while purchasing Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in 2017. It's also been launching its own private-label brands at a faster pace, competing directly with the third-party merchants selling on its marketplace.\n\nIt's also part of Amazon's more aggressive effort to get more holiday shoppers onto its site. On Monday, Amazon announced that it was getting rid of the $25 minimum purchase requirement for \"hundreds of millions\" of items during this holiday season.\n\nThe catalogs will also be available at Amazon Bookstores and 4-star locations, the company said.\n\nYou can see the full catalog here.\n\nWATCH:Trump wants to prove that Amazon is costing the Post Office billions, here's why it's not that simple", "Duncan Hines is recalling 2.4 million boxes of cake mix because of a link to salmonella.\n\nThe recall affects Classic White, Classic Butter Golden, Signature Confetti and Classic Yellow varieties of cake mix, according to Conagra Brands, Duncan Hines' parent company.

Democrats are expected to take control of the House, while Republicans are expected to keep a slight majority in the Senate.\n\nThe market has been volatile recently. Stocks suffered steep losses in October thanks to concern about the elections, as well as fears about rising rates and a possible slowdown in earnings growth.\n\nLee, former chief equity strategist at J.P.

He sees a GOP sweep as more likely and a jump in spending a probable outcome.\n\n\"Why would they control spending? They haven't done it so far. More spending seems likely if you get a sweep either way. The U.S. deficit, it's a fact, it's 5 percent of GDP, the biggest in quite some time. It was 10 percent in the peak of the financial crisis, but as far as a non-crisis year, it really stands out,\" said Schumacher. \"If you get the sort of expected outcome which is Democratic House, Republican Senate, I think it's not terribly interesting.

These vile efforts to degrade and disparage others are contrary to the highest ideals of our state and country.

At the event, Winfrey, who briefly drew national attention as a possible challenger in 2020 to President Donald Trump, said she was a registered Independent and that she was \"not trying to test any waters\" for a political run.\n\n\"I've earned the right to do what I want to do when I want to do it.

Immigration. Rain?\n\nWith voters along the Eastern Seaboard getting wet heading to the polls this Election Day, political scientists and meteorologists are attempting to game out whether the inclement weather could be an issue affecting voters this cycle.\n\nThe forecast Tuesday is for scattered, severe thunderstorms. The weather has taken on unusual significance, because it can be a quiet determinant of voter behavior. Studies have shown that bad weather can depress turnout, particularly among groups likely to vote for Democrats.\n\nA recent study published in the journal American Politics Research rebuts some of those findings, but its results are no better for those on the left. Researchers found that bad weather can actually increase turnout \u2014 but just among those voting for Republicans.\n\nThe bad weather will stretch from from south of New York City to Georgia, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle, according to Jonathan Erdman, a senior meteorologist at weather.com and IBM. In Tennessee, the wind gusts were severe enough to damage homes and knock a fire truck off the road.\n\nStarting around 2 p.m., more precipitation will move through Maine, beginning in the south of the state and heading eastward.\n\nParts of the Upper Midwest will be dealing with \"some raw, windy, cold, wet weather,\" said Erdman. In North Dakota, voters will have to tread through some snow, but the roads will stay open.\n\nBut, experts caution, the effect of the weather on voting this cycle could be erased by high voter enthusiasm.\n\n\"I just don't see it being an issue,\" said Al Roker, a meteorologist and the weather anchor on NBC's \"TODAY.\" \"At least, today. I don't think the weather is bad enough. I think people on both sides are motivated enough to go out and vote.\"\n\nRoker said when he voted earlier, there was a long line at the polls. Long lines, particularly amid a trend toward fewer polling locations, could be more of an issue than the weather.\n\nMassive early voting numbers point to record turnout this year, with more than 35 million people casting their votes before Election Day even began.\n\nScience backs up the idea that competitive elections are less susceptible to the effects of precipitation.\n\nIn 2011, researchers affiliated with Harvard University found that \"while rain decreases turnout on average, it does not do so in competitive elections.\"\n\nWith Democrats aiming to take back the House of Representatives, and Republicans hoping to hold onto control of the government for the remainder of President Donald Trump's first term in office, the elections this cycle are as competitive as ever.\n\nDemocrats need to gain 23 seats in Republican-held districts in order to take the lower chamber. While pollsters believe the outcome is likely, it is far from certain.\n\nErdman said that despite the mucky weather on Tuesday, there is some silver lining to the storm clouds.\n\n\"If there is some good news to this, at least it's not cold,\" he said.", "The \"Fast Money\" traders shared their first moves for the market open.\n\nTim Seymour was a buyer of Halliburton\n\nKaren Finerman was a buyer of UPS\n\nBrian Kelly was a seller of Lockheed Martin\n\nGuy Adami was a buyer of Anadarko\n\nTrader disclosure: On November 5, 2018 the following stocks and commodities mentioned or intended to be mentioned on CNBC's \"Fast Money\" were owned by the \"Fast Money\" traders: Tim Seymour is long ACBFF, AMZA, ACB, APC, APH, BABA, BAC, BIDU, BX, C, CCJ, CGC, CLF, CMG, CNTTF, CRON, CSCO, CWEB, CX, DAL, DPZ, DVYE, EA, EEM, ERJ, EUFN, EWM, FB, FXI, GE, GILD, GM, GOOGL, GTII, GWPH, HAL, HK.APH, HYYDF, INTC, ITHUF, JD, KHRNF, KSHB, LEAF, MAT, MCD, MJNE, MO, MOS, MPEL, MPX, MRMD, NKE, OGI, ORGMF, OTC, PAK, PHM, PYPL, RH, RL, SBUX, SQ, STZ, T, TIF, TGOD, TRSSF, TRST, TWTR, UA, UAL, VALE, VIAB, VOD, X, XLE, XRT, YNDX, 700.

Bank of America's comment on the topic is a good example of the current thinking: It says stocks could surge 12 percent on Washington gridlock.\n\nIt's true that gridlock often has been good for stocks, but it's not clear it will be this time around. Remember, much of the benefit to stocks in the last two years has come because we were not in a gridlocked environment. That's how the tax cuts got through.\n\nSo, for the last two years, stocks have risen because Washington was not gridlocked. But now we're expected to believe stocks will go up because it is gridlocked.\n\nMany aspects of the Trump administration's agenda will certainly continue, such as banking deregulation. While there is little chance that the Trump tax cuts will be rolled back with the Senate in Republican hands, there is also very little chance the tax cuts will be made permanent with the Democrats in the House.\n\nIn addition, more stimulus may be tough to come by. Many people, myself included, believe the Republicans will become much more concerned with the buildup in deficits. If that is the case, there will be very little room for any stimulus spending, particularly on the infrastructure projects that everyone agrees are needed but disagrees on how to pay for them.\n\nAnd if there is even a slight slowdown in the economy, which seems likely, President Donald Trump will likely try to blame the Federal Reserve for raising rates, which will put the Fed in a box that will make it difficult for it to back down.\n\nThe Democrats will certainly begin a long investigation into Trump's finances. Trade tensions will continue. Interest rates are rising.\n\nThank goodness, not everyone is on board with all this happy talk that the markets will inevitably rise on gridlock. Ben Snider at Goldman Sachs, in a note to clients on Election Day, noted that should the consensus on the election prevail, \"we would expect markets to price slightly weaker fiscal stimulus and growth, as well as continued trade tensions, which likely means downside risk to Treasury yields.\"\n\nHe went on to note that \"US equities have historically performed well following midterm elections, regardless of the outcome, although this could be less likely in the current environment with less potential for fiscal policy easing.\"\n\nAmen to that. This is a very different environment than last November, when tax cuts were imminent.", "Can't find that hot holiday toy your kid wants? It may be for the best.\n\nParents who attempt to buy everything on their kids' holiday wish lists could actually be doing more harm than good, according to a new report from T. Rowe Price.\n\nThe survey, conducted shortly after last year's holiday season, sampled 1,013 parents who have kids age 8 to 14. A little less than half (45 percent) said they \"try to get everything on my kids' lists, no matter the cost.\"\n\nProblems with that attitude come on two fronts:\n\nFirst, many gift-happy parents take drastic measures to make their kids' holiday wishes come true, with 59 percent saying they spent more than they should have and 48 percent taking on debt. One in 10 of those dipped into their emergency funds to cover purchases, while 7 percent have taken a payday loan and 4 percent have withdrawn from retirement savings.\n\nThose choices can have far-reaching financial consequences.\n\nSecond, experts say kids who get everything on their holiday wish lists may develop poor money habits themselves. Among those indulgent parents in the T. Rowe Price survey, 69 percent report that they've been unsuccessful in getting their kids to save money instead of spending it right away.", "Islamic State, the jihadist group that once held control of large parts of Iraq and Syria, is still \"very much a problem\" as it continues to pump out terror content online, a European security official has said.\n\nJulian King, the EU's commissioner for the security union, said Tuesday that, although the Islamist militant organization has suffered a drop in its global influence and presence on the ground, it continues to exploit the internet as a means of promoting its extremist ideology.\n\n\"When it comes to terrorism content online there are specific organizations, most notably but not uniquely ISIS, al-Qaeda is also trying to use the digital space,\" King told CNBC's Elizabeth Schulze on Tuesday at the Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nISIS was once notorious for its use of online propaganda material to persuade disenfranchised young people in the West to flee their home country to fight for its cause in the Middle East. It has also claimed responsibility for numerous terror attacks in the West.\n\n\"Now, they've suffered reversals on the ground in Iraq and Syria, but they're still producing material, they still use the internet to traffic their propaganda and their radicalizing material,\" King said. \"So it remains very much a problem that we need to deal with today.\"", "Apple has long been a market darling, but it's gotten sliced and diced recently.\n\nShares of Apple were trading higher on Tuesday, but the stock has sunk 13 percent from its all-time high hit last month, shedding $145 billion in market cap since then. The stock is now on track for its longest weekly losing streak in six years, posting losses for five straight weeks and now pacing to post a sixth.\n\nBut this downturn, with the stock now trading near three-month lows, could very well be a chance to buy, according to a leading technical analyst.\n\n\"It's been a tough week for Apple, but we see this as an opportunity. Tough week, even over the last month, has retraced pretty much all of its gains following its last earnings report in July, when it had the positive response,\" Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, said Monday on CNBC's \"Trading Nation.\"\n\nWald said he's watching the $196 per share level, which he said may become support after the stock gapped above that price following its July earnings report. That level is also just above the stock's rising 200-day moving average. It was trading above $204 on Tuesday morning.\n\n\"What makes this a compelling story, and why I think this pullback should be bought, is looking at the action versus the market. That July strength marked a six-year relative breakout for Apple versus the S&P 500. We're correcting back into that major support level. Aside from some near-term base-building, I think this is a terrific opportunity for long-term investors,\" he added.\n\nOthers are less sanguine on the stock at this juncture. The stock slid on its earnings report last week, deepening its after-hours decline after Apple said it would no longer report individual sales numbers for the iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\nThe stock's valuation has come down to just over 15 times forward earnings, said Boris Schlossberg, managing director at BK Asset Management. By that measure, Apple is slightly cheaper than the broader S&P 500, which trades at nearly 16 times forward earnings. But he's still not a buyer.\n\n\"On the other hand, what you're seeing basically is that Apple \u2014 which used to be a hardware company that made all this money on hardware by creating a very, very pleasant software environment \u2014 is trying to become a software company, and that transition is just not very comfortable for it,\" he said Monday on \"Trading Nation.\"\n\nSchlossberg is no bear on the stock, he said, but he thinks it will trade in a range for some time. He'd recommend selling puts against the stock, but wouldn't chase the stock at this point.", "The level of job openings in the U.S. edged lower in September but was still well ahead of the total number of people looking for work, the Labor Department said Tuesday.\n\nVacancies edged lower to just over 7 million, according to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey.\n\nThe JOLTS report measures the level of employment vacancies as well as those who have left their positions. The previous count, for August, showed a record high of 7.3 million openings, a number revised higher in the report Tuesday. Consensus estimates from FactSet had pointed to a slight decrease for September, but still at 7.125 million.\n\nDespite the decrease, the level of openings still dwarfed the level of those considered unemployed, which was just under 6 million for September. The ranks of the unemployed moved up to 6.08 million in October, but the corresponding JOLTS data won't be released until next month.\n\n\"Since there is considerable volatility in the data, a one-month decline is little reason for concern \u2014 especially given the substantial upward revision the previous month,\" said Julia Pollak, labor economist at ZipRecruiter, an online employment marketplace. \"Anecdotally, companies have been hiring earlier than ever before ahead of the holiday season and new year. Overall, business demand for workers remains strong.\"\n\nIn addition to the decline in job vacancies, the \"quits\" rate, which measures those who left their jobs voluntarily and is seen as a sign of worker confidence, declined a bit from 3.65 million to 3.6 million. However, the quits rate, which compares those who left their jobs as a percentage of total employment, held at 2.4 percent.\n\nGeographically, the quits rate rose one-tenth of a point in both the Northeast and South, to 1.7 percent and 2.9 percent respectively, fell substantially in the West from 2.5 percent to 2.2 percent, and edged lower in the Midwest from 2.6 percnt to 2.5 percent.\n\nThe latest JOLTS report comes amid a tightening labor market that features a brisk pace of hiring and the best wage gains since the post-recession recovery began in mid-2009. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 250,000 in October while average hourly earnings jumped 3.1 percent on a year-over-year basis.\n\nConditions in September remained tight, with 188,000 fewer vacancies in the private sector and a drop of 96,000 openings for government jobs. Health care and social assistance saw the biggest increase, with 71,000, while professional and business services saw a decline of 118,000 and finance lost 82,000.\n\nTotal hires also bounced lower off a record August, declining from 5.9 million to 5.74 million. Separations, which combines quits and fires, fell from 5.78 million to 5.67 million.\n\nA separate Labor report showed that unemployment was lower in 308 of the 388 U.S. metropolitan areas, up in 58 and unchanged in 22.", "Democrats taking the House will be too distracting, says Anthony Scaramucci 8:05 AM ET Tue, 6 Nov 2018 | 00:48\n\nA Democratic blowout in Tuesday's midterms would be debilitating for President Donald Trump and Americans, according to former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci.\n\n\"I wouldn't like the fact that the Democrats win ... because I think they'll start doing things to the president that will be sclerosis for everybody,\" Scaramucci said Tuesday in an interview with CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\nIn the first national election since Trump took the White House, Democrats are expected to gain control of the House but not the Senate.

Two of the more lucrative ones these days are excluding gains from the sale of your primary home or from a stock sale of a business you own and operate.\n\nThe IRS permits capital gains from certain business stock sales to be excluded from federal tax. The catch: It only applies to qualified small business stock acquired after Sept. 27, 2010 that is held for more than five years.\n\nEven better, the federal agency allows taxpayers to exclude up to $250,000 (or $500,000 for payers who file a joint return) of the gain from the sale or exchange of property owned and used as a principal residence for at least two of the five years before the sale.\n\nHere's why that's so powerful as a tax-saving tool.\n\nTraditionally, ordinary income (i.e., a paycheck) is taxed at rates ranging from 10 percent to 37 percent. Because rates are graduated, you won't pay the highest rate on your entire income. For example, you might pay 28 percent in federal taxes as a single earner on up to $191,650 in income, but a higher rate for income above that amount.\n\nLong-term capital gains, on the other hand, have only three tax brackets: 0 percent, 15 percent or 20 percent. For many individuals, this tax tends to be in the 15 percent range. However, this also can vary widely depending on how much you earn. Either way, one thing is clear \u2014 long-term gains generally are taxed more favorably than ordinary income.\n\nThe process for determining whether you have a long-term capital gain is fairly straightforward. If you've owned an asset for more than a year and one day, long-term rates apply. If it's increased in value, then the gain will be taxed. If the asset has lost value, then a loss may be applied. The amount of gain or loss is determined by the amount you paid or \"basis\" for the asset.", "Whoever wins, getting past midterms could be good for stocks 9:39 AM ET Tue, 6 Nov 2018 | 01:20\n\nAs of Monday, election forecasts from FiveThirtyEight give the Democrats an 85% chance of gaining at least 23 seats and taking majority control of the House, with Republicans predicted to hang onto the majority in the Senate.\n\nWith odds-makers pointing to a divided government, many investors see this as a positive scenario.\n\nSentiment from analysts out of Blackrock, Bank of America an Citigroup reveal a common theme: Gridlock is good for stocks.\n\nAdd to that, a seasonal bullish tailwind \u2013 since 1982, the final two months of the year during a Midterm Election have been quite positive for stocks, including when the House changes hands.\n\nThe Nasdaq leads, gaining over 5 percent, trading positively 78 percent of the time.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow and S&P both log gains of better than 3 percent.\n\nCompare that to all years in the final two months: the S&P gains 2.95 percent, the Nasdaq gains 3.37 percent and the Dow gains 3.4 percent.", "Consumers about to see CVS\u2019 vision for health care\u2019s future 1:36 PM ET Tue, 6 Nov 2018 | 01:19\n\nConsumers will soon start to see CVS Health's vision for the future of health care.\n\nCVS expects its roughly $69 billion acquisitionof health insurer Aetna to close before Thanksgiving, the company said Tuesday when announcing third-quarter financial results.

That spending was \"primarily related to the use of online search engines (primarily Google),\" and other online services, according to Booking.\n\nGoogle is such a critical piece of Booking's advertising budget because so many travelers search for trips with terms like \"flight to New York\" or \"hotel in London.\" Booking is competing for that highly valued traffic with Expedia, TripAdvisor, Trivago and even Google's own services.\n\nMark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, estimates that \"north of 80%\" of Booking's performance marketing expense goes to Google.

A Google search for \"flight from San Francisco to Chicago,\" brings up another Google page that lets the user type in dates and times.\n\nIn its most recent quarterly report, Booking mentions Google 52 times and highlights the risk of relying on Google for a \"significant portion\" of its traffic and bookings.", "Interactive Brokers CEO: Market will drop 2-3% if Dems regain the House, 10-15% if they also get Senate 9:09 AM ET Tue, 6 Nov 2018 | 02:33\n\nWall Street would see a major correction if Democrats were to take control of the House and Senate in Tuesday's midterm election, predicts Thomas Peterffy, founder of the Interactive Brokers online trading platform.\n\nThe stock market could drop as much as 15 percent if Republicans were to lose both of their majorities on Capitol Hill, the billionaire supporter of President Donald Trump said Tuesday on CNBC's Squawk Box.\"\n\n\"If the Senate also goes Democrat, then I think we could expect a 10 to 15 percent drop,\" Peterffy said.\n\nA Democratic sweep in Tuesday's voting is seen as rather unlikely, according to polls and forecasters.\n\nHowever, the most likely scenario is Democrats winning the House and Republicans keeping the Senate.\n\n\"I think on the short run that we'll have a negative impact on the market,\" said Peterffy of that outcome. He sees a divided House and Senate leading to a 2 to 3 percent pullback in stocks.\n\nUnder either outcome, Peterffy said he'd be a buyer of stocks once the dust clears and the market bottoms.\n\nIn the event of a Republicans sweep, also seen as unlikely, Peterffy said he'd buy stocks right away. \"If both houses of Congress are retained by the Republicans, then I think we'll go back to the highs.\"\n\nDemocrats need a net gain of at least 23 House seats to wrest control from the GOP. The current balance of power in the 435-member House is 235 Republicans, 193 Democrats, no independents and seven vacancies.\n\nOn the U.S. Senate side, Republicans hold a slim majority of 51-49 seats.\n\n\"I think it all depends on tonight,\" Peterffy cautioned. \"So, I am waiting.\"\n\nLast month, the Interactive Brokers CEO had said he was considering changing his bearish views on the market.\n\nPeterffy, who had turned negative on stocks in June, told CNBC on Oct. 11 that his firm's customers at the time had more than $50 billion of idle cash in their accounts, calling it a historic high.", "Fast food chain Bojangles said on Tuesday it would be taken private by investment firms Durational Capital Management LP and Jordan Co for $593.7 million.\n\nBojangles shareholders will receive $16.10 in cash for each share they hold, representing a 15 percent premium to the stock's price in September, before Reuters reported that the company was exploring alternatives including a sale.\n\nBased on Monday's closing price, the per-share acquisition price represents a premium of 0.6 percent.\n\nWATCH:Why McDonald's and Burger King are failing in Vietnam", "Citi is getting more bullish on Square, citing the payment company's growth potential and emergence as a player in banking for next generation consumers.\n\nThe firm upgraded Square shares to a buy with a $90 price target Tuesday, about 20 percent higher than their $75 closing price a day earlier. Shares are already on a tear this year \u2014 up 116 percent since January and more than 100 percent year over year. The stock rose 2.8 percent Tuesday morning to $77.13.\n\nSquare reports third-quarter results after the closing bell on Wednesday. Ahead of that, Citi lifted its 2019 adjusted revenue estimate and now sees growth of 51 percent, compared with the Wall Street consensus estimate of 42 percent. Citi cited Square's spending and payback model.\n\n\"We believe the company is positioned well to grow in line with some category leaders in payments and software,\" the Citi note said. \"We remain convinced that Square is both a 'new market' and 'lowend' disruptor, currently growing its ownership in the micro and small business commerce enablement space \u2013 a large category that has historically been under served.\"\n\nThe firm noted Square's \"robust\" user acquisition spending and plans to expand its San Francisco headquarters. The fintech company announced a 34 percent increase in office space by February 2019 in a SEC filing shortly after its August earnings results. Citi expressed confidence in \"continued platform growth.\"\n\nJob openings were another bullish undercurrent in Citi's upgrade. The number of open opportunities on Square's external job board has increased by about 15 percent since Citi last counted in April 2017.\n\n\"It's clear the company has increased its desire to ramp headcount in marketing, operations, and talent recruitment,\" Citi said.\n\nBut Square did lose one key employee this year. In October, CFO Sarah Friar announced she was stepping down to become CEO of Nextdoor. Shares of Square, run by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, dropped as much as 8 percent after the announcement. Any progress on Friar's replacement should be positive momentum for the stock, Citi said.\n\n\"We have no reason to believe Square's CFO departure relates to a negative change in the company's forward prospects \u2014 we think most would agree that Ms. Friar is of CEO-caliper and her pursuit of an outside CEO role is genuine,\" Citi said. \"Given Square's category leadership and high profile, we do believe the company is well-suited to attract a highly talented CFO to help lead the company in its next phase.\"\n\nSquare is best known as a payments processor but has moved into some traditional banking areas like small business lending. Citi said the consumer lending arm was a possible risk. By definition, the company is now \"highly exposed\" to small business and consumer spending and \"investors appear more cognizant of this risk,\" Citi said.\n\n\"We think SQ is a category leader in the democratization of ERP-like [enterprise resource planning] software tools for [small-to-medium businesses] and potentially a player in developing banking tools for the next generation consumer,\" Citi said.", "Microsoft built its new campus in Minecraft so employees can know what to expect 9:31 AM ET Tue, 6 Nov 2018 | 02:03\n\nFour years ago Tuesday, Microsoft closed its $2.5 billion acquisition of Mojang, developer of the video game Minecraft. It was Satya Nadella's first multibillion-dollar deal since taking over as CEO in February 2014.\n\nAs it turns out, Minecraft had more to offer Microsoft than just a wildly popular game with 91 million monthly active users and 250 million downloads. The technology is now being used to help employees get acquainted with a refresh of Microsoft's sprawling campus in Redmond, Washington.\n\nEarlier this year, Microsoft enlisted Blockworks, a company that uses Minecraft's digital building blocks for designing real-world projects, to create a miniature rendering of the campus facelift, which is scheduled for completion in 2022. They're using graphics that are far more immersive than two-dimensional photos and videos.\n\nMicrosoft's corporate headquarters occupies 500 acres of land and houses more than 100 buildings. Rather than setting up an entirely new campus (or two) like Amazon, or following Alphabet, Apple and Facebook in expanding into new areas, the software company is updating its existing one, tearing down old buildings and erecting new ones, while also adding cricket and soccer fields and room for retail businesses.\n\nWhile Minecraft was designed for gamers, its immersive nature and the ability to quickly move around and construct edifices makes it easy to see how new buildings will look when inserted into an existing landscape. Microsoft recognized the potential of the game and introduced an education edition two years ago. It has racked up 35 million licensed users.\n\n\"When you build in Minecraft, you build everything in the perspective of the player, constantly being aware of the sense of scale,\" said James Delaney, a managing director at Blockworks, which says on its website that it uses Minecraft \"to create experiences, communities and learning environments.\"\n\nIt's only natural that a kid was involved in the idea of using Minecraft to miniaturize the new campus.\n\nRiku Pentikainen, who until recently was director of global workplace strategies inside Microsoft's real estate and facilities group, saw his son playing Minecraft earlier this year and was intrigued by how the game could help the company with its transition. Employees could learn and get excited about the remodeling long before they could check it out on foot, and in a more dynamic way than what was available through typical renderings.\n\nMicrosoft brought in architecture firm Gensler, along with Andrew Yang, a project manager, to work with internal staff, including Peter Zetterberg of Microsoft Studios, and Amy Stevenson, Microsoft's archives manager, who provided pieces of history about campus landmarks. They got approval from Phil Spencer, Microsoft's executive vice president for gaming, to use Minecraft for the project, Yang said.\n\nFrom there, the group issued a request for proposals, ultimately deciding on Blockworks, which had done work for Disney, Warner Bros. and the Museum of London, as well as Microsoft. The mandate for Blockworks was to have a virtual campus set up within a few weeks, in time for a Microsoft hackathon on July 27.", "The political divide between Democrats and Republicans in the United States has become particularly divisive ahead of the midterm elections Tuesday.\n\nHowever, according to Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, the work he is doing with Tesla and its role in advancing sustainable transportation is more important than politics \u2014 or just about anything else.\n\nIt's \"very important for the future of the world,\" Musk told Recode's Kara Swisher in an interview Wednesday at Tesla's Palo Alto, California headquarters. \"It's very important for all life on Earth.\n\n\"This supersedes political parties, race, creed, religion, it doesn't matter. If we do not solve the environment, we're all damned,\" Musk said.\n\nIt is for that reason that Musk and his team have put forth an \"excruciating effort,\" he said, often working over a hundred hours a week in order to ramp up production of Tesla's Model 3 vehicle, which had fallen behind.\n\n\"The other option would have been, Tesla dies,\" Musk told Swisher.\n\n\"Tesla cannot die. Tesla is incredibly important for the future of sustainable transport and energy generation. The fundamental purpose, the fundamental good that Tesla provides, is accelerating the advent of sustainable transport and energy production.\"\n\nElectric vehicles reduce the emissions that contribute to climate change. In October, the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report saying that limiting global warming \"would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.\"\n\nAccording to Musk, without Tesla there would still be a transition to sustainable energy, but it would take much longer. \"History will judge this, obviously, but I would say on the order of 10 years, maybe 20 years,\" he said. \"This could be all the difference in the world.\"\n\nNow, Tesla is \"doing pretty well,\" said Musk, despite its Model 3 production issues.\n\n\"Tesla's not staring death in the face. We're in, I think, a pretty good position,\" Musk said. \"Up until around September, we were really faced with ... 'We're gonna die,' constantly. I feel like we're no longer in the staring-death-in-the-face situation.\"\n\nMusk himself previously stepped into the political arena when he joined three advisory councils on business, manufacturing jobs and infrastructure for President Donald Trump in December 2016. Musk withdrew from the councils in June 2017, however, when Trump backed out of the Paris climate accord, a 2015 agree among various world leaders to fight climate change.

Stanley McChrystal a few things about managing his time effectively. During his career, he adapted to changing priorities often, with nearly five years as the head of the Joint Special Operations Command and a year as the commander of U.S. and International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Afghanistan.\n\nNow retired, the 64-year-old veteran tells CNBC Make It he continues to put the productivity lessons he learned into practice as he leads a consulting firm and teaches at Yale University.\n\nHere are a few tips this retired general says will help you get the most out of any day.\n\n1. Set goals for your time \u2014 and be accountable to them\n\nAs McChrystal moved up through the ranks and took on more responsibility, he realized he needed to be more effective with his time. McChrystal says time is a leader's \"most precious resource.\"\n\nIn his calendar, he began setting goals for the share of time he'd spend on different tasks in a given month. \"I'd say I want to spend 10 percent doing this, 25 percent this,\" he says. \"At the end of that period we'd come back and compare it to the calendars and see how we really did.\"\n\nOnce the month was over, McChrystal reflected on whether or not he met his goals. This tactic helped control his schedule while making delegating easier. He allotted more time to the tasks that only he could do, and gave tasks he did out of habit or comfort to other people. He says this approach freed him up to do tasks that were appropriate for his role and his level.\n\n2. Write everything in your calendar \u2014 even when you'll shower\n\nMcChrystal is disciplined about ensuring every task and commitment is reflected on his calendar. His schedule includes even mundane tasks like writing emails. He also slots in time on his calendar for showers \u2014 a habit he says makes his wife laugh.\n\nThe retired general schedules even the tedious tasks because they are work realities he needs to account for. Furthermore, once a task is added to his calendar, he says he's more likely to do it.\n\nNot including small chores and errands would result in him trying to squeeze tasks like email into weekends or late nights, he says, lowering the quality of his work.\n\n\"That just jams me up and I do a less professional job,\" McChrystal says. \"The idea is to force myself to address those things that I know have to be done to keep the organization moving.\"\n\n3. Get to work at least 30 minutes early\n\nLike many other successful leaders, McChrystal is an early riser. He says mornings are the one time of day when he's in complete control, adding that he's not getting phone calls at 4:30 a.m.\n\nHe uses early mornings to work out and clear his head. He then gets to work at least 30 or 45 minutes before he has to. He takes the time to prepare for the day ahead, decompress and enjoy a cup of coffee with others in the office.\n\n\"If I've got a meeting at 8 and I'd come in at 7:59, I'm kind of harried, my mind is on things and I really don't do it very well,\" he says. \"If I come in and sort of get myself settled, it's worth the additional time coming in early to do that.\"\n\nLike this story?

If you undersell yourself when answering this question, Welch tells CNBC Make It, you run the risk of being \"underpaid and undervalued from day one.\" On the other hand, if you oversell yourself, \"you could price yourself right out of a job offer.\"\n\nBelow, Welch shares a helpful three-step process to follow when preparing your answer:", "This column originally ran on Medium on Sept. 17, 2018.\n\nApple's new watch sounds like a win for anyone interested in their heart health. It will notify wearers of a slow or irregular heart rhythm, and it can take a basic electrocardiogram (ECG), a recording of the electrical activity of the heart.\n\nDuring Apple's presentation of the new watch on Sept. 12, the company boasted of its FDA clearance and basked in praise from American Heart Association president Dr. Ivor Benjamin.\n\nAs a heart doctor, my opinion is that if you think an Apple Watch is nifty, buy one. But do not buy it for your health. It will not improve your health, and it could even bring you harm.\n\nIn particular, I'm concerned about the problems that arise when we screen healthy people.\n\nI concede that early detection seems like a good idea, especially for atrial fibrillation (AF). AF can increase a person's risk of stroke, and many people who have AF don't know it. We also have effective ways to treat it, including drugs that block clotting\u2014called anticoagulants\u2014that can reduce the risk of stroke in patients with AF and other risk factors, such as high blood pressure or diabetes.\n\nThe first obstacle when it comes to AF screening is understanding that the vast majority of people do not have AF, but most people do have normal variation of their heart rhythm, which can mimic AF. Benign premature beats, for instance, can make your rhythm irregular.\n\nThis makes ECG accuracy a problem. Recently, I co-wrote an editorial in JAMA-Internal Medicine, where my co-authors and I reviewed studies of AF screening with medical-grade 12-lead ECGs, which are more accurate than the one-lead ECG used in the Apple Watch.\n\nThe specificity of an ECG (its ability to correctly identify people who don't have AF) is around 90 percent. That may sound good, but the 10 percent of the time that an irregular rhythm is falsely labeled as AF will exert a massive effect in large populations\u2014like the millions of people who may soon own the new Apple Watch.\n\nTo put this into perspective, let's use a round number of 1 million watch owners. We know that about 1 percent, or 10,000 people, will have AF, and 990,000 will not have AF. If the watch is wrong 10 percent of the time, that means nearly 100,000 people will be falsely diagnosed with AF.\n\nSending hundreds of thousands of wrongly diagnosed people to the doctor scares me. In addition to needless anxiety and costs, this is hazardous because while some doctors will simply reassure the patient, many other doctors will order tests. Since all medical interventions come with risks, many people will suffer harm from unnecessary tests and procedures.\n\nAnother snag in heart rhythm screening stems from a poor understanding of AF. Despite decades of research, doctors still argue about the causes of AF and its treatments.\n\nIn 2017, Harvard researchers published a paper exposing a core deficit in AF knowledge. In their review of 34 studies of hundreds of thousands of patients with AF who were not treated with clot-blocking drugs, they found wide variation in the rate of stroke, which means we don't really know the stroke risk of having an AF diagnosis.\n\nEven if the Apple Watch identifies true AF, we can't be sure the treatment will do more good than harm. While anticoagulants reduce the rate of stroke when used in patients with multiple risk factors\u2014like high blood pressure, diabetes, and older age\u2014these patients are typically diagnosed with AF using ECGs done in doctor's offices, usually because they are experiencing symptoms.\n\nI worry that the Apple Watch will discover lots of short-duration AF or AF occurring in younger people with fewer risk factors. Given their lower risk of stroke, it's unlikely that anticoagulant drugs will deliver similar benefits. But anticoagulants do increase the risk of bleeding.\n\n\n\nThe truth is that preventive health is far more complicated than identifying irregular rhythms from a watch. When you endeavor to make healthy people healthier, you always risk making them worse.\n\nJohn Mandrola is a cardiac electrophysiologist at Baptist Health Louisville.", "A woman makes about 80 cents for every dollar a man does, on average, but that shortfall can vary widely depending on what you do.\n\n\"As much as we've kept the light on this issue, it's been essentially stagnant for two decades,\" said Kim Churches, CEO of the American Association of University Women, a Washington-based nonprofit dedicated to advancing equity for women.\n\nAlthough women experience a persistent pay gap in nearly every occupation, the professions with the most significant income discrepancies are largely in the finance and medical industries, according to a new report by the AAUW.", "Abrams, who is one of six children, grew up in Gulfport, Mississippi, and later moved to Georgia with her family.

Excluding items, CVS earned $1.73 per share, above the $1.71 per share expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.\n\nRevenue rose 2.4 percent to $47.3 billion, surpassing expectations of $47.2 billion. For the business unit that includes CVS' retail pharmacy operations, revenue increased to $20.86 billion, up nearly 7 percent from the $19.59 billion in the year-ago quarter, driven by an 8.4 percent surge in pharmacy revenue.\n\nThe company's retail business showed signs of improvement, with revenue from the so-called front store, which includes products like makeup and vitamins, increasing 2 percent from last year. Same-store sales, a closely watched metric, were up 0.8 percent. While the trends improved, they were up against easy comparisons.\n\n\"While this is a shallow gain, it is most definitely a step in the right direction,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. \"However, our outlook on the retail side remains cautious, and we are split as to whether this represents the start of a new upside for CVS' retail operation, or whether it is just an anomaly.\"\n\nLike other drugstores, CVS is searching for ways to lure shoppers who are increasingly shopping online. One solution might be CarePass, a membership program CVS is piloting in Boston.\n\nTo shake up its business model, CVS is in the midst of acquiring health insurer Aetna for roughly $69 billion. CVS received preliminary approval from the Department of Justice in October to move forward with the deal. The company still needs a handful of states to clear the deal, including New York, where state officials are considering blocking parts of it.\n\nCVS on Tuesday said it has received approval from 23 of the 28 states it has filed with and is \"well down the line\" with the remaining five.

The programs cover treatment for the majority of people on dialysis in the state, often paying a predetermined set fee for treatment. But individual health insurers usually have to negotiate rates with dialysis providers, sometimes paying several times that charged to Medicare.\n\nThe ballot proposition would limit the revenue earned, or roughly the rates privately insured patients are charged, for dialysis treatment to 115 percent of the costs to provide the care. Anything above would be put to dialysis providers, which would be forced to give insurers or patients rebates to make up the difference.\n\nSupporters of the proposal say one way the reimbursements could help patients is in the form of lower premiums, Erin Trish, a research professor at the USC Price School of Public Policy, told CNBC.\n\n\"Ultimately, the heart of this proposition is kind of rooted in a belief that the private payments are too high,\" said Trish, whose research focuses on U.S. health insurance markets. \"It's not fair that the rates are so much higher than Medicare.\"\n\nDaVita spokeswoman Alicia Patterson said \"Prop 8 will limit patients' access to life-saving dialysis.\" She also pointed to a coalition of 160 medical professionals, clinics and business groups that say it could have far-reaching implications across the state, including clinic closures.\n\nThe \"No Prop 8\" group calls it a dangerous measure that could jeopardize access to dialysis care that patients need to survive.\n\n\"California Proposition 8 sets severely low limits on what insurance companies are required to pay for dialysis care,\" the coalition says on its website. \"These limits do not cover the cost of providing care, forcing many dialysis clinics to cut back services or even close.\"", "Facebook has admitted it failed to prevent its social media platform being used to incite violence in Myanmar.\n\nAn independent report commissioned by the tech giant was published Tuesday, finding that Facebook had been misused in a way that contributed to human rights abuses in the country.\n\n\"A minority of users (in Myanmar) are seeking to exploit Facebook as a platform to undermine democracy and incite offline violence,\" it said.\n\nBusiness for Social Responsibility (BSR), the non-profit that conducted the report, added that Facebook had \"created an enabling environment for the ongoing endorsement and proliferation of human rights abuse in Myanmar.\"\n\nThis had been done in various ways, including character assassinations, rumor-spreading, and hate speech against minority individuals.", "Goldman Sachs: Italian budget tensions are quite elevated 6:38 AM ET Tue, 6 Nov 2018 | 02:30\n\nThe Italian government is unlikely to back down from its 2019 budget deficit plan until market pressures rise, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nEuro zone commissioners have pressed Italy to amend its budget to abide by EU rules, and have given Italy until next Tuesday to revise spending plans to reflect a lower deficit projection.\n\nSpeaking after the euro zone ministerial meeting in Brussels on Monday, the Italian Finance Minister, Professor Giovanni Tria, said the budget \"will not change.\" On Tuesday morning he appeared to reinforce that position when he told CNBC that he expected to have further disagreements.\n\nJari Stehn, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC's Street Signs on Tuesday that near-term tensions remained high and a breakthrough in talks between Rome and Brussels would likely take time.\n\n\"We think that in the response next week the Italian authorities are probably not going to back away from their plan to increase the deficit\" he said.\n\n\"We ultimately think that things might have to get worse before they get better in terms of market pressure,\" Stehn added.\n\nItalian growth (gross domestic product) fell to zero in the third-quarter of this year and its government debt has ballooned to more than 2.3 trillion euros ($2.6 tn).\n\nThe yield on 10-year Italian sovereign debt is at 3.393 percent, near to its highs of 2018 and sitting at levels not seen since early 2014.

Those rising yields could ultimately weigh on stocks.\n\n\"Americans realize that we have one of the spectacular economies in our country's history\u2026does it really make the market go higher?

While the Fed is not expected to raise interest rates this week, it is likely to do so in December.\n\nMassocca said trade could be another big factor for the markets, regardless of who wins Congress. President Donald Trump has said China wants to do a deal, and he will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit at the end of the month. But strategists are skeptical progress will be made soon, and Trump has also vowed to slap China with more tariffs if things don't go well.\n\n\n\n\"If these tariffs could be effective in winning some short term victories that's a very good thing,\" said Massocca. \"If we get a protracted trade war, that's a bad thing.

Over the past few months, his clients have started bringing it up first.\n\n\"It's part of every single conversation I have with buyers and sellers,\" said Tucker, president of the Eli Residential Group at RLAH Real Estate. \"I have people coming to me wondering if they've missed the boat with Amazon HQ2 and sellers wondering if they should sell now or if they should hold onto their property.\"\n\nOn Monday, media outlets including NBC News reported that that Amazon is now planning to split its new headquarters between more than one city, meaning that Crystal City would share any benefits of a new Amazon building -- as well as any drawbacks.\n\n\"The roads are already pretty clogged as it is and I can't imagine having 50,000 more people just across the city in Crystal City,\" D.C. resident Mark Manivog said, referencing the 50,000 jobs Amazon originally claimed HQ2 would bring to the new location. (That number is likely to be half as large if Amazon splits its new headquarters.)\n\n\"I'll be happy, there will be more jobs and more opportunity, but at the same time there is the traffic issue and there is the housing price issue.\"\n\nOther locals, like Northern Virginia resident Lars Dyrud, hardly see a downside to having Amazon HQ2 in the area.\n\n\"I think it's virtually all positive,\" he said. He noted that local property owner JBG Smith had already \"done a great job of revitalizing the area\" ahead of the anticipated Amazon selection.\n\nReal estate professionals seem to agree that if Crystal City does become a new Amazon location, housing prices will almost certainly increase. Both Tucker of RLAH and Associate Broker Aaron Seekford of Arlington Realty advise sellers that if they have the option to hold on their property until after the announcement, they could sell for more without much additional risk.\n\n\"If Amazon does not come it's not like the market is going to bottom out,\" Tucker said. \"You can make a speculative play and if Amazon decides to go elsewhere you're still in a really strong real estate market.\"", "Investors should buy shares of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries as the company's turnaround picks up steam, Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger said Monday.\n\nRisinger upgraded the stock to overweight from equal weight.

But if one can't be reached, the president said he's ready to move ahead with another $267 billion in tariffs.

On top of that, average hourly earnings rose 3.1 percent from the same period a year ago, the fastest pace during the post-Great Recession recovery.\n\nWhile that's all good news, concerns are now rising about the pace of gains.\n\nThe Federal Reserve estimates that the natural rate of unemployment is around 4.5 percent, which Jan Hatzius, Goldman's chief economist, calls \"broadly reasonable.\" Looking down the road, Goldman sees unemployment falling to 3 percent by early 2020 and wage growth to hit the 3.25 percent to 3.5 percent range over the next year or so.\n\n\"So the economy really needs to slow to avoid a dangerous overheating,\" Hatzius said in a note that pointed out some signs are emerging of a cooling.\n\nWhat matters next is how the data feed into the broader growth picture.\n\nHatzius said inflation \"is on track for a meaningful overshoot\" of the Fed's 2 percent mandated target, up to 2.3 percent, which would be \"within the Fed's likely comfort zone. But we see the risks to this forecast as tilted to a bigger increase.\"\n\nThose higher inflation risks are coming from the gains being documented in the labor market, as well as tariffs that are raising the cost of imports, the note said.\n\n\"Labor market tightness is moving to levels rarely seen in postwar history at the national level, and our analysis of city-level data suggests that such extreme readings typically push inflation notably, not just slightly, higher,\" Hatzius said.\n\nThe Fed has been responding to the pickup in inflation expectations by raising rates and indicating that it will continue to do so through 2019. In fact, Goldman says the central bank will have to be even more aggressive than the market thinks. The firm is forecasting five more quarter-point rate hikes through early 2020, which would be two more than traders are pricing, and said risks to that forecast also are \"a little tilted to the upside.\"\n\nThe Fed meets Wednesday and Thursday and is not expected to take any action on the benchmark funds rate, which is set in a range between 2 percent and 2.25 percent. Markets are currently pricing in a December move, followed by two more in 2019.\n\nPolicymakers may choose to tip off the next rate and could include language in the post-meeting statement to indicate where they think growth is heading and how that figures into longer-range actions.

Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who lost to Pelosi when he challenged her to be the House minority leader, is open to the idea of vying to lead Democrats in the lower chamber of Congress, an aide told CNBC.\n\n\"No decisions have been made regarding leadership, but Rep. Ryan has left the door open on the matter. Any decision would come after tomorrow's election results,\" Michael Zetts, Ryan's communications director, said Monday.\n\nPelosi, the California Democrat who was the first female speaker of the House, has made it clear on the campaign trail that she has been focused on helping Democrats regain the majority in the House. However, she's confident she will become the next House leader if Democrats take over Congress.\n\n\"It is up to them to make that decision, but I feel pretty comfortable where I am,\" Pelosi said this year at a CNN political forum when asked if she will be the next speaker.\n\nPelosi previously was speaker from January 2007 until January 2011.\n\nDemocrats need to flip 23 seats to win a majority. Experts give the party good odds to overtake the GOP. As of Monday, data analyst Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight gives Democrats an 87 percent chance of retaking the House.\n\nA senior Democratic aide close to Pelosi, who asked not to be named, blasted the notion that Ryan might try to challenge the California Democrat, suggesting that the Ohio lawmaker is trying to position himself for a presidential run in 2020.\n\n\"Tim Ryan has done nothing but exploit his criticism of Nancy Pelosi to get himself on TV and prepare for a presidential run,\" the aide said. \"He has done absolutely nothing to distinguish himself since he last lost to Pelosi. Pelosi has tirelessly traveled the country and raised half of the record DCCC haul. Ryan is a shameless self-promoter and actively undermined Democratic unity going in the election. It's unlikely Ryan will jump in because a lamb who has been slaughtered twice by Pelosi isn't a terribly effective presidential campaign platform from which to spring from.\"\n\nRyan, who's consistently governed as a moderate Democrat, has said publicly that he's also considering running on the Democratic ticket for president in 2020.\n\nA spokesman for Pelosi did not return requests for comment.\n\nRyan once competed against Pelosi for a leadership post. After President Donald Trump won in 2016 and the GOP held onto the House, Ryan challenged Pelosi for the title of House minority leader. Ryan lost, but he still managed to garner 63 votes compared with Pelosi's 134.\n\nOther Democrats have made it a point to say they don't support Pelosi for a leadership role. According to an NBC News survey taken in August, at least 50 Democrats running for House seats said they would not back Pelosi for speaker. Many of those candidates opposing her called on Pelosi to step aside and argued it was time for new leadership.\n\nThose close to the minority leader, though, scoff at the idea of Pelosi not receiving enough votes to lead the party if the Democrats make inroads in the House. They point to her get-out-the-vote efforts and the impact she's had raising money for Democratic election committees, including the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or the DCCC.\n\n\"She's been cold, calculated and the Democrats most important weapon in combating Republicans trying to keep their majority. She's been running on three things: messaging, money and mobility,\" said a close Pelosi advisor who declined to be named. \"There's not a single member of the Democratic congressional leadership who has even come close to what Pelosi has done throughout the year. With that being said, no one within her party will have the courage to take her on if they pull off a victory on Tuesday.\"\n\nIn October, Pelosi's office announced that she had raised $34.2 million for Democrats during the third quarter. That total includes $30.5 million directly for the DCCC. For the 2018 cycle, Pelosi raised $121.7 million for Democrats and since entering leadership ranks in 2002, she's raked in $714.5 million for her party.\n\nIn the past week, her extensive work on the campaign trail has led her to tell donors and advisors that she's confident Democrats will gain at least 30 seats in the House.\n\nNonpartisan elections analysis site Sabato's Crystal Ball also expects Democrats to pick up more than 30 seats in the House.", "Since many Americans need help financing their holiday shopping, a lot of retailers offer store-branded credit cards with deferred interest rates. That means you can carry a balance on them without having to pay interest for a set amount of time.\n\nBut while these cards can indeed help you afford an expensive purchase, they can also end up costing you more than you may realize because of the way the interest rate functions once it kicks in.\n\nA recent WalletHub survey found that, while 85 percent of store credit cards that have 0 percent annual percentage rate introductory offers have deferred interest, 82 percent of Americans don't understand how deferred interest works.\n\nHere's the deal: You make a purchase on a card with an introductory offer of 0 percent APR for a set number of months. If you're able to pay off the loan consistently and in full within that introductory period, you won't have to pay any interest. If, on the other hand, you miss a payment one month or can't pay off the card in full, you get slammed with interest charges \u2014 and not just on however much of your unpaid balance remains. The introductory offer essentially vanishes, and you owe interest as though a regular APR were in effect the whole time.\n\nLet's say you make a $1,000 purchase on a card with an APR of 25 percent that is deferred for one year. If, at the end of the year, you've only paid off $950, you owe not 25 percent of your remaining balance of $50, or $12.50, but 25 percent of the total $1,000, or $250. That's a significant difference.\n\n\"Deferred-interest financing is like a wolf in a sheep's clothing,\" WalletHub reports. \"Since many retailers don't disclose deferred interest clearly enough, it can lead to some expensive post-holiday shopping season surprises.\"\n\n\"If you see 'no interest' and 'if paid in full' in the same sentence, that should be a red flag,\" says Brian Karimzad, a researcher at CompareCards.com. That wording would indicate that the card's zero-interest period is conditional, not guaranteed.\n\nAccording to WalletHub's survey, of those who understand the concept, 79 percent think deferred interest is unfair and 62 percent think it should be illegal.\n\nIf you don't fully understand deferred interest, you might think your store card will function like a balance-transfer credit card, which lets you only pay interest on the balance that remains after a no-interest introductory period, not the entire original amount. In fact, a balance-transfer card may be a better option for you if you expect to have to take on some debt to buy gifts this holiday season.\n\nDon't miss: Once you hit this credit score, going higher is a 'waste of time,' expert says\n\nLike this story?

In return, the banks are expected to reduce their exposure to Sears by lending $150 million instead of the $300 million originally promised to the department store operator, according to the sources.\n\nLampert is not expected to contribute to the financing after the retailer garnered adequate interest from other lenders, the sources said. Lampert's hedge fund, ESL Investments, had been in discussions in recent days about participating in the financing, the sources added.\n\nHowever, ESL still remains open to lending additional money to Sears should the company fall short of the funds it needs in its final negotiations with other potential lenders, one of the sources said.\n\nA financing deal is expected to be announced as soon as this week, though the negotiations remain fluid and an agreement is not guaranteed, the sources said.\n\nA Sears spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Cyrus spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nSears filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Oct. 15 with a plan to close about 142 of its 700 stores by the end of the year, throwing into doubt the future of the 125-year-old retailer that once dominated U.S. malls but has withered in the age of internet shopping.\n\nSears, which employs roughly 68,000 people, is negotiating with ESL on a potential initial bid on financially healthier stores that executives believe could keep the retailer alive, according to the sources and court filings.\n\nESL could end up bidding on up to 500 Sears stores, or about 100 more than the 400 healthier stores Sears initially identified when filing for bankruptcy, one of the sources said.\n\nSears has had trouble raising additional financing beyond what banks originally promised. That is because ESL and other possible new lenders balked at providing as much as $300 million that would be second in line for repayment and lacked the desired collateral to back the loan, the sources said.\n\nA hearing to finalize Sears' bankruptcy financing is scheduled for Nov. 15, according to a court filing.\n\nWATCH: Sears was the Amazon of the 1930s.

However, Carter Worth, head of technical analysis at Cornerstone Macro, says there's something in the charts suggesting the stock could be poised for a breakout ahead.\n\nOctober was a catastrophic month for the major indexes, with tech leading the slide lower. Yet Worth notes that Oracle's ability to withstand the selling pressure could be indicative of bullish activity ahead.\n\n\"[Oracle is] showing a key thing it's holding up when others are under pressure,\" he said Friday on CNBC's \"Options Action.\" \"People were selling everything but they sold a little less of this and that's the definition of relative strength.\"\n\nWorth also noted that despite the stock's failure to perform relative to the broader tech sector over the long term, history has shown that after significant pullbacks the name has successfully rallied higher.\n\n\"What has happened three or four times is that when this starts to improve ... you then get both absolute and relative performance,\" he said.\n\nDespite Oracle's volatile performance this year, the stock is still up more 43 percent since 2016.

Investors will be watching the midterm elections on Tuesday for clues as to where the markets will head next.\n\nAlli McCartney, managing director at UBS Private Wealth Management, said: \"We could absolutely rally after midterms. You have traditionally seen that, and given how much negative sentiment there is right now, however having the lowest misery index, very high levels of consumer confidence, to a certain extent I would expect that.\"\n\nStacey Cunningham, president of the New York Stock Exchange, said: \"If you look back to 2016, we did see some uncertainty about elections, and the Brexit referendum, and the presidential election, but the market absorbs news much more quickly than it ever did before. Information travels so much faster. So when news comes out, it gets very quickly absorbed by the market, and it had leveled off, and we saw a lot of things that were happening last year that normally the market would have reacted [to], and they hadn't.\"\n\n\"I think the market will stabilize. Somewhere in here there's a bottom. I don't know where, but I think it's going to happen after midterms, although I don't think midterms have been a factor in the correction. I think it will be a factor now over the next 10 days, waiting until things to stabilize,\" said Barbara Doran, senior portfolio manager at BD8 Capital Partners.\n\nJack Hough, associate editor at Barron's, said the results from the midterms may ultimately play little role in the markets no matter the outcomes. \"I look at history, and I say, what's happened in the past when we've had a Republican president and the Democrats flipped all or a part of Congress.

I haven't counted exactly, but I would just sort of sleep for a few hours, work, sleep for a few hours, work, seven days a week. Some of those days must have been 120 hours or something nutty.\"\n\nNow, Musk said he is \"down to 80 or 90\" hours of work per week and \"it's pretty manageable.\"\n\nMusk said while \"80 is pretty sustainable,\" the increase in suffering when you work more than that is dramatic. \"The pain level for hours increases exponentially. It's like nonlinear above 80,\" Musk said, according to a transcript.\n\nStill, 80 hours a week is over 10 hours more than the average CEO of a multibillion-dollar company works.\n\nA study published in June by Harvard Business Review found CEOs worked an average of 62.5 hours a week. On average, the CEOs monitored for the study worked 9.7 hours per weekday, which totals just 48.5 hours per work week. They also worked 79 percent of weekend days at an average of 3.9 hours daily, and 70 percent of vacation days with an average of 2.4 hours on those days.\n\nFor the study, Harvard professors Michael Porter and Nitin Nohria, tracked how 27 CEOs of companies with an average annual revenue of $13.1 billion spent their days in 15 minutes increments, 24 hours a day, seven days a week for three months.\n\nAs for Musk, he has attributed some of his recent controversial behavior to his work schedule.", "Tax deadlines have historically helped boost one group of stocks heading into the last few months of the year, according to analysis from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nStocks that drop at least 10 percent in the first 10 months of any given year are candidates for what's known as \"tax-loss harvesting.\" Mutual funds have an Oct. 31 deadline to sell, or \"harvest,\" any beaten-down stocks in order to offset gains in other investments and reduce tax liabilities.\n\nSince 1986, stocks that fit the \"tax-loss harvesting\" criteria subsequently rose by an average of 5.1 percent in the three months following that deadline, according to BofAML. The uptick is higher than the S&P 500's average return of 3.7 percent in the same period, with a hit rate of 69 percent.\n\n\"In a year characterized by volatility and reversals, the next catalyst may be tax loss harvesting,\" BofAML equity strategist Savita Subramanian said in a note to clients Monday. \"On a monthly basis, this strategy tends to have the highest median returns in November and January, perhaps benefiting from the rebound after the October 31 deadline for tax loss selling for mutual funds and then the rebound after the December 31 deadline for regular tax filers.\"\n\nFrom 2000 through 2012, tax loss candidates, or \"TLCs\" as Subramanian calls them, from November to January outperformed the market every year except for 2007.\n\nWhile the strategy averages solid returns across three months, it has historically underperformed the S&P 500 in \"seasonally strong\" December alone, which Subramanian said is when other investors do much of their tax-loss selling.\n\nTo be sure, the strategy didn't work from 2013 through 2015, when it was \"overshadowed\" by year-end macro factors like a government shutdown, the end of OPEC price support and central bank policy. The TLC stocks have outperformed for the end of 2016 through 2017.\n\nBofAML screened the S&P 500 for stocks with year-to-date price declines greater than 10 percent as of Oct. 31 and compiled a list of stocks rated as \"buy.\" Names from all 11 sectors show up, but financials and consumer discretionary were the most common.

The shares are still down about 5 percent this year, roughly in line with the loss for the broader S&P 500 energy sector.\n\nChevron reported a $4 billion profit for the third quarter of 2018, more than double its earnings during the same period a year ago. The San Ramon, California-based company pumped at a record level last quarter, and executives said they now expect to hit the upper range of their guidance for oil and gas output for the year.\n\nCredit Suisse on Monday upgraded the company's stock to outperform from neutral. The investment bank maintained its price target of $138 on the shares.\n\nThe bank said Chevron \"continues to execute on its already superior growth outlook,\" even as its stock trades at a \"wider than normal\" discount to fellow U.S.-headquartered oil major Exxon Mobil.\n\nChevron now says it expects its oil and gas production to grow at the top end of its previously forecast range of 4 percent to 7 percent.\n\nThat should yield better capital efficiency in 2018 and boost free cash flow, in Credit Suisse's view. Healthier cash flow will allow Chevron's management to reward investors with a competitive quarterly dividend payment and potentially expand its $3 billion per year share buyback program, the bank said.\n\nThe engine behind Chevron's growing output is its Wheatstone and Gorgon natural gas projects in Australia, the Permian Basin underlying Texas and New Mexico and several offshore projects, according to Credit Suisse.", "Berkshire has been a big buyer of Apple over the last two years, though its purchases slowed more recently as the stock rose.

Now that Berkshire is willing to buy its own shares, it might be less tempted to make a big acquisition with its cash that doesn't pan out, he said. \"It speaks to me of a significantly derisked position,\" Rolfe said.\n\n\"If Plan b is to buy back our own shares, shareholders should feel very comfortable.\"\n\nWATCH: What does Buffett's buyback mean?", "Bono has a message for the U.S. Congress: Thanks for ignoring President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump has sought to slash hundreds of millions of dollars from U.S. funding for AIDS programs at home and abroad, but the U2 frontman says members of Congress \"have so far turned down this president's request to cut AIDS funding \u2014 right and left in lockstep together on this.\"\n\nHis message to them? \"Thank you for your leadership.\"\n\nBono is caught between hope and frustration as \u2014 for the third time in a decade \u2014 he organizes an auction to raise money for the fight against HIV/AIDS. Sotheby's announced details Monday of the Dec. 5 sale in Miami to benefit (RED), the charity founded by Bono in 2006.\n\nTwo previous sales, in 2008 and 2013, raised $68 million. Five years on from the last, Bono says big strides in prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS are threatened by a slackening of global resolve.\n\n\"We could be at the dumbest moment ever, which is we're almost at the moon and we turn back,\" Bono told The Associated Press by phone from Dublin.\n\nAlmost 37 million people worldwide have HIV, with nearly 22 million of them receiving antiretroviral therapy, the most effective form of treatment, according to UNAIDS. The number of annual infections has fallen by almost half since 1996, to 1.8 million, and the number of deaths has halved since 2004.\n\nBono says the results are the product of \"incredible leadership from around the world\" that has made the elimination of the disease a realistic prospect.\n\n\"There's this gathering consensus and momentum \u2014 and now people are looking the other way, and it's just the wrong moment,\" he said.\n\nTo help draw attention back to the cause, Bono turned to two influential artists whose work, he says, \"has a social-justice core.\" The auction is curated by British architect David Adjaye, who designed the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., and U.S. artist Theaster Gates, who runs artistic and social projects from his base on Chicago's south side.\n\nAdopting the theme \"light,\" the pair has assembled more than 50 lots from artists, architects and designers, including Ai Weiwei, Jeff Koons, Yinka Shonibare and Sean Scully. Design pieces include sneakers by Christian Louboutin; a curvy coffee table by the late Zaha Hadid; and a ring carved from a whole diamond, created by Apple design chief Jony Ive and industrial designer Mark Newson.\n\nAdjaye is offering items he's designed including a concrete speaker \u2014 in red, naturally \u2014 and Gates has contributed one of a series of tapestries made from strips of used fire hose.\n\n\"We wanted to re-shed light on this subject matter, metaphorically,\" said Adjaye, who also worries that the world's attention has strayed from AIDS, and other crises.\n\n\"I think our collective sense of civil society is very much under siege,\" he said. \"That creates a kind of 'not my problem' attitude, and I think we have to counter that.\"\n\nMoney raised by the auction will go to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and to Gates' Rebuild Foundation, which works with deprived communities in Chicago.\n\nOne criticism sometimes made of charities like (RED), which has persuaded big companies including Bank of America, Starbucks and Apple to promote AIDS awareness, is that its work lets politicians and governments off the hook.\n\nBono argues that \"the point is to put them back on the hook.\"\n\n\"Making something popular makes the politicians have to pay attention,\" he said. \"And we're going to need that more than ever\" in an era of growing nationalism.\n\n\"Women are the rising category (of infections) at the moment, and whilst the world is looking the other way in this rather childish fight among strongmen across the world, these budgets are being cut and women are paying the highest price.\n\n\"It's really deeply upsetting for us all,\" he added. \"Because we were really getting excited. We thought, we're at the point of inflection. And now we hear, 'No, no. We're going to cut these budgets.' It's not just America. A lot of countries are putting themselves first.

That is the fewest since 2008. Mortgage applications to refinance have been falling steadily and are now about 32 percent lower compared with a year ago, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.\n\n\"There will always be a population of laggards,\" said Craig Strent, CEO of Maryland-based Apex Home Loans. \"Some folks have had poor past experiences with the mortgage process and just may not want to deal with it again. They also may not be aware how much technology has removed a lot of the friction in the mortgage process the past few years.\"\n\nIf interest rates continue to rise, which they are expected to, fewer borrowers will be able to see any savings from a refinance. And not only will there be less incentive to refinance, but there will also be less incentive to move. A huge share of today's borrowers already refinanced to or bought homes with mortgage rates at record lows. In order to move, they would have to trade their rock bottom rate for one significantly higher.\n\nHigher rates are also making it significantly costlier to afford a home. The monthly principal and interest payment needed to purchase the average-priced home has seen a $190 per month increase since the beginning of 2018, an 18 percent jump, according to Black Knight.", "The reimplementation of U.S. sanctions on Iran will benefit the hard-line faction within the Middle East country, according to the Washington, D.C.-based National Iranian American Council (NIAC).\n\nThe non-profit group \u2014 which aims to represent Iranian Americans \u2014 added that the sanctions could also isolate the United States and increase its reliance on Saudi Arabia in the region. Policy Director Ryan Costello told CNBC Monday that the current president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, is a relative moderate in Iran's political elite who may have to adopt a tougher stance if he is to retain his political influence.\n\n\"Rouhani really has had the rug pulled out from in terms of sanctions \u2026 When you look at the forces who have benefited from this decision it is the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) who have benefited,\" Costello said in a phone call.\n\n\"You are kind of likely to see a rally around the flag with this and the moderate wing of the Rouhani government will also have to move more in line with the hardliners,\" he added.\n\nThe Trump administration has reinstated all sanctions removed under the 2015 nuclear deal, targeting both Iran and states that trade with it. The policy director said the sanctions \"snapback\" will allow the Iranian government to shift blame on the U.S. as the cause of domestic suffering, especially should shortages of food and medicines become more acute.", "Voters across the country will head to the polls on Tuesday to determine which party controls the House of Representatives and the Senate for the final two years of President Donald Trump's first term in office.\n\nBut it is not just lawmakers on the ballot. More than 150 ballot measures will be up for consideration on Tuesday, according to a Ballotpedia tally, including 63 measures placed on the ballot by petition that could create new laws or strike down old ones, circumventing state legislatures.\n\nThe bottom of the ballot may not be earning headlines, but it is fertile ground for big spenders looking to shape policy at the state level. Ballot measure campaigns have spent more than $1 billion this cycle \u2014 on par with the amount raised for a successful presidential bid \u2014 and have attracted the attention of major businesses and spending groups.\n\nThe issues are heavily charged. In three states, West Virginia, Oregon and Alabama, voters will consider placing new limits on abortion access. In three others \u2014 Idaho, Utah and Nebraska \u2014 voters could choose to expand Medicaid over strong local Republican opposition.\n\nThe key issues this year are election reform and marijuana legalization, with voters in 16 states taking up the issues. Measures in a number of states have pit renewable energy proponents against heavily funded opposition campaigns. Six states could face tougher limits on their ability to collect taxes.", "Earth's protective ozone layer is finally healing from damage caused by aerosol sprays and coolants, a new United Nations report said.\n\nThe ozone layer had been thinning since the late 1970s. Scientist raised the alarm and ozone-depleting chemicals were phased out worldwide.\n\nAs a result, the upper ozone layer above the Northern Hemisphere should be completely repaired in the 2030s and the gaping Antarctic ozone hole should disappear in the 2060s, according to a scientific assessment released Monday at a conference in Quito, Ecuador. The Southern Hemisphere lags a bit and its ozone layer should be healed by mid-century.\n\n\"It's really good news,\" said report co-chairman Paul Newman, chief Earth scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"If ozone-depleting substances had continued to increase, we would have seen huge effects. We stopped that.\"\n\nHigh in the atmosphere, ozone shields Earth from ultraviolet rays that cause skin cancer, crop damage and other problems. Use of man-made chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which release chlorine and bromine, began eating away at the ozone. In 1987, countries around the world agreed in the Montreal Protocol to phase out CFCs and businesses came up with replacements for spray cans and other uses.\n\nAt its worst in the late 1990s, about 10 percent of the upper ozone layer was depleted, said Newman. Since 2000, it has increased by about 1 to 3 percent per decade, the report said.\n\nThis year, the ozone hole over the South Pole peaked at nearly 9.6 million square miles (24.8 million square kilometers). That's about 16 percent smaller than the biggest hole recorded \u2014 11.4 million square miles (29.6 million square kilometers) in 2006.\n\nThe hole reaches its peak in September and October and disappears by late December until the next Southern Hemisphere spring, Newman said.\n\nThe ozone layer starts at about 6 miles (10 kilometers) above Earth and stretches for nearly 25 miles (40 kilometers); ozone is a colorless combination of three oxygen atoms.\n\nIf nothing had been done to stop the thinning, the world would have destroyed two-thirds of its ozone layer by 2065, Newman said.\n\nBut it's not a complete success yet, said University of Colorado's Brian Toon, who wasn't part of the report.\n\n\"We are only at a point where recovery may have started,\" Toon said, pointing to some ozone measurements that haven't increased yet.\n\nAnother problem is that new technology has found an increase in emissions of a banned CFC out of East Asia, the report noted.\n\nAnd the replacements now being used to cool cars and refrigerators need to be replaced themselves with chemicals that don't worsen global warming, Newman said.

They include Coca-Cola and Adobe.\n\n\"We recommend investors continue to focus on firms with demonstrated ability to maintain high margins,\" Kostin wrote in the note to clients Friday. \"Looking forward, margin pressures may rise if U.S.-China trade tensions deteriorate, the labor market tightens, or interest rates climb further.\"\n\nThe third quarter has been strong for the majority of the 381 S&P 500 components that have already reported results, with nearly 78 percent posting positive earnings surprises. The blended earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 is 24.9 percent, with the broad market index on track for its second-highest earnings growth since the third quarter of 2010, according to FactSet.\n\nSource: FactSet\n\nBut despite the rosy third-quarter reports, financial markets have been dropping largely because of these three worries pointed out by Goldman Sachs.\n\n\"The actual impact of tariffs on third-quarter results was minimal because implementation of the 10 percent levy on $200 billion of imports from China only started on Sept 24.,\" Kostin wrote. \"However, the tariff rate is slated to jump to 25 percent starting in January 2019 and an additional $267 billion of imports may be subjected to a 25 percent tariff.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump threatened to slap sanctions on the rest of the goods imported from China \u2014 which exceed $257 billion \u2014 if Beijing fails to bow to Washington's demands for an overhaul to their trade agreement as well as changes to China's technology transfer policy.\n\nThe White House has already imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and Beijing has responded in kind with retaliatory duties on $110 billion worth of U.S. goods. That, in turn, has buoyed costs for American companies that do business in China or source\n\nMost managers expect to reduce the negative impact of tariffs through price increases, Kostin noted, with industrial giants including Illinois Tool Works and United Technologies assuring shareholders that any levies affecting their business will ultimately be passed on to their buyers.\n\nUnited Technologies' CEO Gregory Hayes said that higher costs are almost always pushed on to consumers.\n\n\"I would expect pricing will also have to increase next year if these tariffs remain in place,\" Hayes said on United's earnings call last month. \"Ultimately these tariffs, it all gets passed onto the consumer in one form or another. It's just a tax on the consumer in another way to think about it.\"\n\nGoldman said that companies are also concerned about a tight labor market and implications for wages.\n\nThe government's most recent update on the employment situation showed the U.S. economy added a strong 250,000 jobs in October and a 3.1 percent year-over-year rise in average hourly earnings. The closely watched unemployment rate held steady at a multidecade low of 3.7 percent.\n\nThat's likely to bode poorly for corporate profits, which should see a dent if management is forced to compete to fill vacate positions or to dissuade workers from pursuing better-paying jobs elsewhere.\n\n\"Wages are 60 percent of corporate costs so it's not just an input cost: it's by far the most important one,\" Citigroup chief equity strategist Tobias Levkovich told CNBC on Friday. Some leading indicators are suggesting we \"going to be talking about 3.5 percent, 3.6 percent wage increases in the first quarter of 2019. That, I think, the bond market will have to address and the Fed will have to address.\"\n\nDarden Restaurants, for example, observed that \"Restaurant labor was unfavorable 70 basis points, despite continued productivity gains and sales leverage. The increase was driven by hourly wage inflation of approximately 5 percent,\" according to Goldman's transcript of the Darden call . Meanwhile J.B. Hunt Transport said that \"probably in the next 12 to 18 months, our driver wages are up about 10 percent or a little but more than that,\" according to Goldman.\n\nFinally, higher interest rates will put pressure on margins both as the Federal Reserve hikes its overnight rate and as more bond traders adjust their inflation estimates.", "You might have a great idea, but you will need to continually test and challenge it.

The fourth quarter is estimated to see a 17.5 percent increase. For the full year, that would mean earnings gains of some 17.5 percent for the large-cap index.\n\nHowever, that looks to be the end of double-digit gains for the near future. 2019 is expected to yield a 9.3 percent increase that, while still substantial, indicates a considerable slowdown as well.\n\n\"Not surprisingly, investors also wonder if EPS peaks have historically coincided with equity price sell-offs,\" Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said in a note. \"The unfortunate answer is yes.\"\n\nTo quantify, the bad news is that the current trend points to more market losses. Stovall estimates that the total current correction, which saw the S&P 500 down 9.4 percent at one point, could end up around the historical average for such periods of 14 percent.\n\nThe good news is that Stovall does not see an outright bear market, defined as a 20 percent drop, as is often the case with peak earnings.\n\n\"Indeed, we think the recent unpleasantness represents the readjustment in the anticipated angle of ascent in share prices over the coming year, due to increasingly challenging year-on-year GDP and EPS comparisons,\" he wrote.\n\nOver the past 65 years, a majority of earnings peaks have been accompanied by bear markets or corrections. Earnings growth expectations next year that are half of those seen in 2018 would be consistent with a profit top.\n\nCompanies and analysts have been adjusting their sights about forward earnings due to a number of factors.\n\nThere are concerns about rising interest rates, a slowdown in growth due to fiscal stimulus wearing off, and the belief that the trade battle in which the U.S. has found itself with China and other partners could take a bigger chunk out of the economy than initially anticipated.\n\n\"Recent company comments revealed that fundamental fears are finally coming to fruition, now that Wall Street can no longer deny that global trade disputes are pressuring multinationals' forward guidance,\" Stovall said.", "We're just a day away from the midterm elections, and the big question on everyone's mind is what Congress will look like in January.\n\nWhether the long-term bull market will derail is one question.

The increase was largely driven by $1.4 billion in Trump administration tariffs on Chinese imports and foreign steel and aluminum, the group said.\n\n\"The historic rise in costs for American businesses, farmers and consumers is only the beginning,\" coalition spokesman Charles Boustany said in a statement. Boustany, a Republican, represented Louisiana in the House for over a decade.\n\nThe coalition worked with the Trade Partnership, a consulting firm, to calculate the cost of the tariffs using government data. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on several fronts, including against long-standing economic allies. In March, the president announced new duties on all steel and aluminum imports, citing national security concerns. The measures cost U.S. companies about $545 million in September, the data show.\n\nEven more costly were tariffs levied against China, which the administration has accused of stealing U.S. intellectual property. Those tariffs accounted for $800 million in September, even though the bulk didn't take effect until the end of the month.", "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump's move to deploy troops to the U.S.-Mexico border is so far shaping up to have a cost of $220 million, according to two U.S. defense officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe initial cost estimate, a figure that could change based on the ultimate size and scope of the mission, comes as nearly 4,000 troops moved to the border Saturday as Trump has repeatedly warned of a caravan of migrants from Central America.\n\nIn a briefing Monday, however, the Pentagon said it had no cost estimate at the moment.\n\nIn mid-October, a caravan of at least 3,500 Central American migrants seeking asylum left Honduras for the United States border. The caravan is currently in southern Mexico.\n\nTrump has made the caravan one of his prime targets as he campaigns for Republicans down the stretch of the midterm election campaign. The president has referred to the caravan as an \"invasion\" while claiming that Democrats want open borders, which Democrats deny.\n\nCritics have called the deployment a political stunt. Defense Secretary James Mattis, however, downplayed that criticism last week. \"The support that we provide to the secretary for Homeland Security is practical support based on the request from the commissioner of customs and border police. We don't do stunts in this department,\" he said Wednesday.\n\nA Pentagon risk assessment found that the caravan did not pose a threat to the United States, according to a person with direct knowledge of U.S. intelligence. This person also said that the caravan would take about a month and a half to get to the U.S. border.\n\nA second caravan of about 1,000 to 1,500 people from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, crossed the border into Mexico last week.\n\nThe Department of Defense estimates that more than 7,000 troops will be positioned in California, Arizona and Texas in support of the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection. In which case, the border mission, dubbed Operation Faithful Patriot, will have a larger U.S. military footprint than the combined efforts in Iraq and Syria.\n\nHowever, last week, Trump said he was prepared to deploy as many as 15,000 service members to the border, a move that would be on par with the U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan, which remains America's longest war.\n\nThe Pentagon and White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\n\nThe Washington Post previously reported that the border deployment could end up costing $200 million by the end of the year.\n\nWATCH: The economic cost of immigration detention", "Goldman Sachs is tracking ahead of its goal to generate $5 billion in additional annual revenue by 2020 as growth initiatives bear fruit, and sees opportunities to grow its businesses further, its new finance chief said on Monday.\n\nThe initiatives laid out last year have produced $2.5 billion so far in 2018, according to a presentation Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr gave at an industry event. He stopped short of increasing the target, but suggested Goldman could still do better.\n\n\"This is by no means the limit of the ambition of the firm,\" said Scherr, who plans to provide a strategic update in the spring.\n\nThe presentation marks the first under a new management team at Goldman Sachs.

Core inflation, which strips out volatile factors like energy and food prices, was similarly high. The headline rate is now far above the central bank's target of 5 percent.\n\nInflation has largely been driven by the country's \"currency crisis\" with the lira falling 30 percent against the dollar year-to-date. It had suffered a deeper rout in August when it was down 45 percent against the greenback, but has since recovered some ground. Currency depreciation has been a key factor behind Turkey's inflationary pressures but other issues, including concerns over the central bank's independence and a diplomatic crisis with the U.S., fueled those losses.\n\nTraditionally central banks have raised interest rates to tackle inflation but Turkey's bank is under pressure, notably from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to lower interest rates in order to stimulate spending, lending and economic growth. It defied the president by tightening its monetary policy stance in September, however, raising its benchmark one-week repo rate (its main policy rate) to 24 percent, and maintaining that rate in October.\n\nJason Tuvey, a senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said Monday that he believes Turkey's inflation rate has hit, or is close to, a peak and hence the central bank would be unwilling to tighten (increase interest rates) any further.", "This modern beachfront compound on Long Island is on the market for $21 million.\n\nIt's located about 100 miles from New York City in Montauk, New York, the summer playground to some of America's wealthiest, including A-list celebrities like Robert DeNiro and Ralph Lauren.\n\nTake a look.", "J.P.

Another 42 clients are expected to sign by year-end.\n\nBanks want to move from hawking individual products to becoming platforms that clients can turn to as one-stop shops for financial services. The shift is necessitated \u2013 and enabled by \u2013 advances in technology that allow software to replace human-heavy processes. As the world of finance becomes digitized, simple activities like custody become cheaper to provide, and so banks have to offer harder-to-replicate services as part of a bundle to inspire loyalty.\n\n\"The value of the traditional business of purely operational services continues to diminish because we're finding better ways to do things with technology,\" Heitsenrether said. \"The battle will be won and lost on, 'Can you give me the right information, analytics and services on top of that?'

Meanwhile, ultra-low interest rates that were brought in after the euro sovereign debt crisis of 2011 are expected to start rising again at the end of summer 2019.\n\nHowever, Smets did not confirm or deny that more loans could be made available for Italian banks.

Companies that engage in sanctioned activity with Iran face the threat of being locked out of the U.S. market.\n\nThe 180-day period came to a close this week, restoring a heavier slate of sanctions on Iran than a first round that went into effect after the 90-day grace period. The latest round largely targets oil exports from Iran, OPEC's third-largest crude producer.\n\nThe European Union, which opposes Trump's unilateral withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, is seeking to preserve the accord and protect the continent's companies from the sanctions. However, many European firms have cut off ties with Iran rather than risk losing access to the massive U.S. financial and economic systems.\n\nAccording to the State Department, companies in more than 20 nations have entirely stopped buying Iranian crude, shrinking Iranian oil exports by about 1 million barrels per day and depriving the regime of roughly $2.5 billion in revenue.\n\nPompeo on Monday released a list of countries that can continue importing Iranian oil for the time being, including Iran's top two customers, China and India. Italy, Greece, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey are also on the list. The waivers will allow them to reduce their purchases over the coming weeks and months.\n\nOn Monday, Trump said his administration issued the waivers to prevent a spike in oil prices.\n\n\"I don't want to drive the oil prices in the world up, so I'm not looking to be a great hero and bring it down to zero immediately,\" he told reporters. \"I could get the Iran oil down to zero immediately but it would cause a shock to the market.\"\n\nTrump's Iran policy has been a major contributor to this year's oil price rally.

The firm said \"Larry Culp is key\" to GE turning things around as \"peak uncertainty has been reached\" in the market.\n\nThe argument by GE bulls on Wall Street is an \"academic\" view which values GE on a \"sum-of-the-parts\" basis which gives \"large valuations for the Aviation and Healthcare businesses,\" Inch said.\n\n\"GE cannot completely dismantle to realize its true [sum-of-the-parts] as the company is required to maintain a sufficient revenue and asset base to support all of GE Capital's tens of billions of dollars of debt securities,\" Inch said.\n\nInch also believes that \"no one, including the company, has an accurate handle on the magnitude of GE's total and embedded on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liabilities, which could ultimately exceed\" $100 billion, he said.\n\nGordon Haskett has an underperform rating and a $10 price target on GE shares.\n\nGE market cap is about $80 billion \u2013 a fraction of the nearly $600 billion in August 2000, when it was one of the most valuable companies in history.

A breach would indicate a full test of the February low at 2530 was in order, although we would use the big round number just below.

In the latest opinion polls in Italy published by Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera on Saturday, Lega was seen with 34.7 percent of the vote, a large increase from the 17.4 percent share the party won at the general election in March. Its governing partner M5S has failed to capitalize on its prominent position, however, sliding 4 percentage points to 28.7 percent.\n\nIn the springtime election, the left-wing anti-establishment M5S party gained the biggest share of the vote for any single party but Lega gained the most votes within an alliance of right-leaning parties (including former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party). As neither M5S or the right gained enough of the vote to govern alone, M5S and Lega formed a coalition government, one that has been noted for its euroskeptic and populist rhetoric ever since.\n\nWith its often controversial and outspoken leader, Matteo Salvini, who is both deputy prime minister and interior minister, Lega has emerged as arguably the more dominant party in the coalition. M5S, on the other hand, is led by Neapolitan Luigi Di Maio who is also minister for economic development.\n\nNow, it appears that the Lega party \u2014 despite its pro-Northern, secessionist reputation and roots \u2014 is winning voters from across Italy and many of these are coming from M5S' traditional heartland. The poll in the Corriere della Sera newspaper showed that M5S has seen its share of the vote fall across all regions, especially in the north.", "Apple has told its smartphone assemblers Foxconn and Pegatron to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to the iPhone XR which hit shelves in October, the Nikkei reported on Monday.\n\nApple had also asked smaller iPhone assembler Wistron to stand by for rush orders, but the company will receive no orders for the iPhone XR this season, the report said, citing supply chain sources.\n\n\"For the Foxconn side, it first prepared nearly 60 assembly lines for Apple's XR model, but recently uses only around 45 production lines as its top customer said it does not need to manufacture that many by now,\" the Nikkei quoted a source as saying.\n\nAt its iPhone launch event in September, Apple introduced the lower-cost iPhone XR, made of aluminum, along with two other models, the XS and XS Max.\n\nFive years ago, Apple cut production orders for its plastic-backed iPhone 5C a month after its launch, fueling speculation of weak demand for the model.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company warned last week that sales for the crucial holiday quarter would likely miss Wall Street expectations.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.\n\nFoxconn and Pegatron each said they would not comment on specific customers or products.\n\nWATCH:Apple's stock is plunging \u2014 Here's what six experts say investors should know", "Expert: Not a buyer of oil going into Q1\n\n6:50 AM ET Mon, 5 Nov 2018\n\nKevin Book, Clearview Energy Partners, discusses the impact on the oil market from reimposed economic sanctions on Iran.", "The new CEO of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is tired of being No. 3 in U.S. pickup truck sales.\n\nWith a strategy of loading up its revamped Ram 1500 full-size trucks with new features \u2014 ranging from 12-inch touch screens on the dashboard to large battery packs and electric motors to help adjust speed and gears and conserve fuel \u2014 the automaker is banking on a sustained surge in demand.\n\nSo Chief Executive Mike Manley is now reconsidering a decision announced in January to stop building Ram heavy-duty pickups at a plant in Saltillo, Mexico. That plant, and another in Warren, Michigan, between them would produce other Ram models and free up manufacturing capacity to make even more new trucks to eat into sales of Ford Motor's F-Series or General Motors' Chevrolet Silverado, and its higher-end GMC Sierra.\n\n\"We need to get ourselves into second\" place, Manley told Reuters exclusively in his first interview since taking over the No. 7 global automaker after Sergio Marchionne died suddenly. \"Frankly, I don't care which of the two I take share from.\"\n\nWhen U.S. President Donald Trump was threatening action that would have imposed a 25 percent tariff on Mexican-made pickup trucks earlier this year, Fiat Chrysler said Saltillo would be \"repurposed to produce future commercial vehicles.\"\n\nIn 2017, Marchionne had raised the possibility his company could move heavy-duty pickup production out of Saltillo, saying U.S. tax and trade policy would influence the decision.\n\nNow, the United States, Mexico, and Canada have a tentative trade agreement that imposes no ceiling on shipments of pickups to the United States from Mexico, provided they meet thresholds for the share of parts produced within the region.\n\n\"With a combination of Warren and Mexico building what we call the classic truck, we have enough production to increase output next year if its required,\" Manley said.\n\n\"In my opinion it will be required. We are gaining share. Obviously I am looking for that to continue, but it's an incredibly competitive segment,\" he added.\n\nThe Ram and Jeep brands underpin the automaker's North American business \u2014 which accounted for nearly 85 percent of Fiat Chrysler's second-quarter pre-tax profit \u2014 and offset the struggles of its legacy Fiat business in Europe and operations in China.\n\nFord's F-Series trucks have led the segment for four decades. In 2017, Ford had a 35.6 percent share of U.S. retail truck sales, followed closely by GM at 34.2 percent and FCA with 22.3 percent.\n\nPickup trucks are the single biggest contributor to the Detroit Big Three automakers' profits, so there is plenty at stake as they fight for market share.\n\nIn the battle for pickup customers, GM launched a new version of its Silverado truck designed with a focus on slashing weight and trimming production costs to compete with market leader Ford.\n\nFiat Chrysler, which reports third-quarter results on Tuesday, took a different tack with the new Ram. The automaker stuffed more features into the vehicle \u2014 including an optional 12-inch touch screen and partial electrification that saves fuel and helps with acceleration and cruise control \u2014 on a bet that customers would pay more in return.\n\nSo far, the gamble appears to be paying off. The new Ram 1500's average sale price for the year to date through late October hit $46,856, higher than the $42,389 average for the Ford F-150, according to industry data. Though in FCA's case the data only involves the higher-end versions of the 2019 Ram 1500 that are available so far, but all versions of the F-150.\n\nHayden Elder, owner of Elder Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram in Athens, Texas, said three times in under a month he has had families trade in nearly-new large SUVs made by FCA's rivals for a new Ram 1500.\n\n\"This new Ram is the biggest leap I've ever seen from one version to another,\" Elder said. About 70 percent of the 800 vehicles he sells annually are trucks.", "Sears is in discussions with Chairman Eddie Lampert and lenders on a deal to expand a bankruptcy financing package that would help it avoid liquidation, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe negotiations come at a critical time for Sears, as it needs enough money to keep its shelves stocked during the holiday shopping season and retain enough support from creditors and vendors to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nSears filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Oct. 15 with a plan to close about 142 of its 700 stores by the end of the year, throwing into doubt the future of the 125-year-old retailer that once dominated U.S. malls but has withered in the age of internet shopping.\n\nLampert's hedge fund, ESL Investments, is weighing partnering with other potential lenders to contribute up to $450 million in bankruptcy financing in exchange for key collateral that Sears' banks currently hold, which includes some store leases, the sources said.\n\nIn return for giving up their claims on the collateral, the banks would be given the opportunity to reduce their exposure to Sears by contributing $150 million to the bankruptcy financing, rather than the $300 million originally promised.\n\nThe maneuvers would have the combined effect of boosting the current overall bankruptcy-financing package from $300 million to up to $600 million.\n\nThe negotiations remain fluid and the contours of the deal, including the amount of money lenders would extend, could change, the sources said. The sources declined to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.\n\nA Sears spokesman declined to comment.\n\nSears has had trouble raising additional financing beyond what banks originally promised. That is because ESL and other possible new lenders balked at providing as much as $300 million that would be second in line for repayment and lacked the desired collateral to back the loan, the sources said.\n\nThe reworked loan under discussion aims to give Sears, which employs roughly 68,000 people, more breathing room to avoid liquidation and reorganize around a smaller set of stores expected to be put up for sale.\n\nSears has held discussions with ESL about bidding on roughly 400 financially healthier stores that executives believe could keep the retailer alive, according to court records. One of the sources said ESL is now weighing bidding on as many as 500 stores. ESL would be a so-called stalking-horse bidder in this scenario, submitting an initial bid that others could then attempt to top, according to court filings.\n\nThe sources said that Sears is pursuing numerous options related to its bankruptcy financing.\n\nA hearing to finalize Sears' bankruptcy financing is scheduled for Nov. 15, according to a court filing. A deadline for Sears to obtain a bidder for its stores is currently set for Dec. 15, according to court records.\n\nWATCH: Sears was the Amazon of the 1930s. Here's where the retailer is today", "Amazon.com said on Monday it would offer free shipping with no purchase minimum for the first time this holiday season, heating up the competition with Walmart and other rivals vying for customers' Christmas shopping sprees.\n\nThe U.S.-only promotion, effective from Nov. 5, waives the $25 minimum that customers outside Amazon's loyalty club Prime must hit for free shipping. The deal lasts until Amazon can no longer promise items in time for Christmas with free delivery, which typically takes five to eight business days.\n\nThe announcement could help Amazon sustain its rapid sales growth. Shares of the world's largest online retailer were hammered last month after it forecast the slowest rise in revenue at least since the start of 2016.

You have to have a sense of, 'How am I going to learn a new area?' So I'm looking for an ability to be learning constantly, and fast.\"\n\nSo what is Hoffman's single best job interview question to determine if they have that quality?\n\n\"You take them to some point in their career and you say, 'What would you tell yourself if you could now call your younger self and tell yourself what you've learned in order to be better? And it's not, 'Oh, I learned this fact,' but a pattern of thinking.' They're learning in a way so that they can share it with their team. They can repeat it as, here's something we've learned about how we can make decisions better, how to lead better, how to manage better, and that's encapsulated in something that you could tell younger self.\"\n\nAnd how would he answer his own question? What would he tell his younger self?\n\n\"One thing I learned as a startup CEO, and started embodying in my practice, is to always be recruiting,\" Hoffman said. \"One of the classic mistakes that a younger CEO-founder makes is to think, 'Well, I recruit when I'm looking for a person for a specific job, like a head of marketing or a head of engineering.'\"\n\n\"In fact, you want to be constantly meeting the best people and expecting that your business going to grow,\" he added. \"So you're meeting the people that you're anticipating that you're going to be recruiting in a year two.

And they surely don't need a semiotician of the late Umberto Eco's caliber to explain to them that competitors are always engaged in adversarial games. Shrugging it all off with the philosophical \"never mind\" resignation, the Chinese are happy to pocket the money while promoting their own \"win-win cooperation\" ditties.\n\nEventually, though, the Chinese, the Japanese and the Germans should think of how long that extraordinary bonanza can last. Who knows, one fine day somebody in Washington might realize that this outrage can no longer be tolerated.\n\nSo, here is an idea: Beijing, Tokyo and Berlin should quickly come out with a statement that they are ready \u2014 no kidding \u2014 to immediately begin buying more, much more, from America while dumping their excess production on somebody else.\n\nThat would be a wonderful Twitter line, and it would also pave the way for another gushing torrent of: \"I think we'll make a deal with China, and I think it will be a very fair deal for everybody, but it will be a good deal for the United States.\"\n\nDeals with China don't come easy, though, as Indians and Russians can testify. India unsuccessfully tried to make a border deal with China in April 1960. After a brief war in 1962 and occasional skirmishes, Beijing and Delhi are still talking about an unlikely but crucially important bilateral agreement. And it took 40 years of negotiations for the Russians and the Chinese to agree on their more than 2,600-mile border.\n\nCloser to home, it's been 46 years since the U.S. and China agreed on a \"One-China\" policy, but Beijing still protests that the agreement is being violated, asking Washington twice last week to stop \"official contacts or military ties in any form between the U.S. side and Taiwan region.\"", "Oil prices were little changed on Monday after a steep five-day slump, as the United States formally imposed punitive sanctions on Iran but granted eight countries temporary waivers allowing them to keep buying oil from the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe sanctions are part of U.S. President Donald Trump's effort to curb Iran's missile and nuclear programs and diminish its influence in the Middle East.\n\nOil markets have been anticipating the sanctions for months.

destabilize the country's banking system.\n\nGiven subdued inflation and uncertainty surrounding overseas economies, however, he said the BOJ needed to maintain its massive stimulus program while keeping a watchful eye on the merits and costs of its policy.\n\n\"The BOJ fully recognizes that, by continuing monetary easing, financial institutions' strength will be cumulatively affected,\" Kuroda said in a speech to business leaders in Nagoya, central Japan.\n\nJapan's banking system could destabilize in the event of a severe negative shock, if financial institutions more actively take on risk to make up for narrowing margins from years of low interest rates, he said.\n\n\"Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point ... the BOJ will scrutinize developments and encourage financial institutions to take action as necessary,\" he said.\n\nKuroda's remarks came after minutes released earlier on Monday showed the BOJ's nine-member board discussed the rising cost of prolonged easing at its rate review in September.\n\n\"One member said there was room to make the BOJ's policy framework more flexible in the future\" if the economy continues to expand, the minutes showed.\n\nAnother member said the board should discuss how long the BOJ can maintain its stimulus program, given perceived limits to its policy duration, the minutes showed.\n\nWhile the BOJ will scrutinize financial risks from easing, it also needed to consider uncertainties surrounding Japan's economic outlook as Sino-U.S. trade frictions and rising protectionism could weigh on global demand, Kuroda said.\n\n\"The impact of such problems on Japan's economy is limited for now,\" Kuroda said. \"But if the problems persist, the effect on Japan's economy could become bigger,\" he added.\n\n\"It's necessary to persistently continue with powerful monetary easing, while considering both the positive effects and side effects in a balanced manner,\" Kuroda said.\n\nSubdued inflation has forced the BOJ to maintain its radical stimulus program despite the rising demerits, such as the hit to financial institutions' profits from prolonged low rates.\n\nThe BOJ kept monetary policy steady last month and Kuroda ruled out a near-term interest rate hike amid risks from global trade disputes.", "China's services sector chalked its slowest growth in over a year last month as the volume of new orders dried up, a private survey showed, suggesting a further loss in economic momentum as a rough 2018 draws to a close.\n\nThe slowdown in the services sector \u2014 which accounts for more than half of China's economy and is an important generator of jobs \u2014 is particularly worrying for policy makers as they have been counting on it to offset rising pressure on exports from a heated trade row with the United States.\n\nThe Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 50.8 in October from 53.1 in September, the lowest since September 2017, and creeping closer to the 50 line that separates growth from contraction.\n\nAny prolonged weakness in the services sector would complicate Beijing's efforts to steady growth in the face of the trade dispute with the United States, a manufacturing slowdown at home and campaigns to curb excess capacity, pollution and corporate debt.\n\nA cooling this year of the Chinese property market, another major contributor to the economy, has also weighed on demand for real estate services.\n\nSignificantly, Caixin's sub-index for new business orders showed virtually no growth at 50.1 in October, down from 52.4 the previous month and the worst performance since a contraction in November 2008 during the global financial crisis.\n\nThat dented business confidence towards future activity to a three-month low, according to the survey.\n\nThe nation's financial services sector was especially hard-hit by the subdued market conditions.\n\nChina is leaning on services, particularly high value-added services in finance and technology, to reduce the economy's traditional reliance on heavy industry and investment.\n\nSome firms surveyed by Caixin also expressed concerns of the possible impact of the Sino-U.S. trade dispute on future activity.\n\nThe impact of the trade frictions on business confidence, and real activity, was starting to show in the broader economy.\n\nA separate Caixin survey published last week showed China's manufacturing sector hardly grew in October after stalling in the previous month.\n\nOctober was the first full month after the latest U.S. tariffs went into effect.\n\nWashington and Beijing slapped additional tariffs on each other's goods on Sept. 24, and U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to hit China with more duties.\n\nCaixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Monday, fell to 50.5 in October from 52.1 a month earlier. That was the lowest level since June 2016.\n\nOffering a glimmer of hope, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping had what the U.S. president described as a \"very good\" phone discussion about trade last week.\n\nPlans were being made for them to meet on the sidelines of the G20 leaders summit in Argentina at the end of November.", "\"The economic and social well-being of countries in the world is increasingly interconnected. The reform of the global governance system and the international order is picking up speed,\" Xi said during his speech from the China International Import Expo. \"On the other hand, the world economy is going through profound adjustment and protectionism and unilateralism are resurging. Economic globalization faces headwinds, and multilateralism and the system of free trade are under threat.\"\n\nTo face those headwinds, Xi presented his country as one pursuing \"a new round of high-standard opening up\" and intent on widening \"its market access to the rest of the world.\" In fact, he said, this week's expo \"demonstrates China's consistent position of supporting the multilateral trading system and promoting free trade. It is a concrete action taken by China to advance an open world economy and support economic globalization.\"\n\nThe Chinese leader said his country will seek to stimulate the potential for increased imports and will further lower import tariffs. He also pledged that China will speed up the opening of its education, telecommunications and cultural sectors. As it now stands, Asia's largest economy maintains extensive barriers for foreign firms looking to conduct business in those areas.\n\nThe speech also briefly addressed the issue of intellectual property theft, which has been a chief complaint foreign firms have had about China. Xi pledged to \"enhance\" the punishments for such actions to \"significantly raise the cost for offenders.\"\n\nXi also acknowledged that parts of China's economy are facing challenges and uncertainty right now, but said the government is working quickly to address those issues and has improved in its overall ability to manage macroeconomic growth.", "The sons of slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi on Sunday issued an appeal for the return of their father's body and said they wanted to return to Saudi Arabia to bury him.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Salah and Abdullah Khashoggi said that without their father's body, their family is unable to grieve and deal with the emotional burden of their father's death.\n\n\"It's not a normal situation, it's not a normal death at all.

Turkish officials and some U.S. lawmakers have said that Crown Prince Mohammed ordered the murder, an allegation that Riyadh denies.\n\nKhashoggi's body has not been recovered, and Saudi authorities are conducting an official investigation.\n\nSaudi Arabian billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, an international businessman, said on Sunday that the probe will exonerate the country's leader.\n\nSalah Khashoggi on Oct. 24 met in Riyadh with the crown prince and King Salman to receive condolences along with other Khashoggi family members. Salah departed for Washington a day later, and his CNN interview was his first public comments since then.\n\nHe said King Salman assured him that those involved in Jamal Khashoggi's murder would be brought to justice.\n\n\"We just need to make sure that he rests in peace,\" Salah Khashoggi said of his father. \"Until now, I still can't believe that he's dead. It's not sinking in with me emotionally,\" he said, adding that there has been a lot of \"misinformation\" about the circumstances of the death.\n\nSalah said that charges that his father was a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood organization were not true.\n\nAsked how Khashoggi should be remembered, Salah replied, \"As a moderate man who has common values with everyone ... a man who loved his country, who believed so much in it and its potential.\"\n\n\"Jamal was never a dissident. He believed in the monarchy, that it is the thing that is keeping the country together. And he believed in the transformation that it is going through.\""]
