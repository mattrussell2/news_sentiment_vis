["The bond market's year in decline could round out with some relief.\n\nTreasurys are setting up for a near-term pop as a level of support forms in the charts, according to Paul Ciana, chief global fixed income, currencies and commodities technical strategist at Bank of America.\n\n\"What we have on this chart is the potential for a double bottom forming right down here at these lows,\" Ciana said on CNBC's \"Futures Now\" on Thursday, referring to U.S. 30-Year Treasury bond futures.\n\nThose long bond futures bottomed in early October, and made a higher low earlier this month.\n\n\"In fact, [Wednesday's] price action didn't break down to a new low to suggest that this isn't a possibility. We also had a bullish signal occur earlier in October at those lows,\" he added. \"There's a possibility that the bond market could establish itself, here provided no new low occurs, and we could see a 3 to 5-point rally in the U.S. long-bond Treasury future.\"\n\nCiana has seen a similar set-up on the 5-year Treasury futures chart. He says a buy signal was triggered when prices bottomed out on Wednesday at October lows before moving higher, suggesting a double-bottom in formation.\n\n\"I think the tactical trade here is to be long [5-year U.S. note future] and U.S. Treasury futures. If we make a new low, you're stopped out but the potential for a rally here from the technical side as well as positioning and seasonals does suggest a bit of a pop,\" said Ciana.\n\nHowever, for the longer term Ciana remains bearish on the bond market. He has a target of 3.45 percent in the 10-year yield and 3.75 percent in the 30-year. The 10-year yield above 3.45 percent would mark its highest level since April 2011.", "Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba promises that this year's annual Singles' Day this Sunday will be the \"largest-ever in terms of scale and reach.\"\n\nThe holiday, which started as a day for unmarried Chinese to buy gifts for themselves, has become the biggest single shopping event in the world. Consumers bought a record $25.3 billion in merchandise during last year's Singles' Day \u2014 surpassing the $19.62 billion spent between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday in 2017.\n\nAmazon said it sold more than 100 million items during its Prime shopping holiday on July 16, with analysts estimating that consumers spent about $4 billion, by comparison.\n\n\"If you take Prime Day which happened this summer, Amazon reported $4 billion this year which is a really strong number but in comparison it's kind of cute,\" said Danielle Levitas, executive vice president of market insights at App Annie, which provides mobile data and insights.\n\nAccording to Levitas, App Annie is projecting that Singles' Day will drive $32 billion in spending this year.\n\nAlibaba is pushing a new strategy this year, promoting sales both online and in brick-and-mortar stores.\n\n\"One of the reasons the 180,000 merchants and 600 million consumers in China and consumers outside of China are so interested in this Singles' Day event is because it gives them many, many more opportunities to participate, and to be involved in something that is both fun but also a great experience,\" Alibaba President Michael Evans said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Friday.\n\nIn the past few years, Singles' Day has surpassed the transaction volume of both Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined. The event has also far surpassed Amazon's Prime Day, which is the most similar to Singles' Day because it is also a 24-hour, online shopping event.\n\nChina's middle class is significantly bigger than the total U.S. population and the country is more technologically savvy, Levitas said.\n\n\"You combine the size of the population, their sophistication, acceptance, and preference for mobile and it's not surprising that the U.S. and something like Prime Day's success will be substantially smaller,\" she said.\n\nAccording to Levitas, Americans spent an estimated $8 billion on Black Friday both in physical stores and online, and Cyber Monday raked in about $6.6 billion.", "Democrat Andrew Gillum has withdrawn his concession in the Florida gubernatorial race following a recount.\n\n\"I am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call that we count every single vote,\" Gillum said at a press conference in Tallahassee on Saturday.\n\nUnofficial election results showed Republican former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis ahead of Gillum by less than 0.5 percentage points. Under state law, such a margin requires a machine recount of ballots.\n\nGillum had conceded the race to DeSantis on Tuesday night.\n\nDeSantis responded by saying the Florida election results are clear and he is moving forward as he prepares to be the state's next governor.\n\n\"Those results are clear and unambiguous, just as they were on Election Night,\" DeSantis, a former congressman, said in a video posted Saturday on YouTube by the Republican Party of Florida.\n\nWhile DeSantis said it's important to follow state law, he added, \"With the election behind us, it's now time to come together as a state as we prepare to serve all Floridians.\"\n\nWATCH: This midterm ballot initiative could swing Florida in 2020", "The fact that paychecks have been slow to increase amid the robust economic recovery and record-high corporate profits has left some workers frustrated.\n\nRecently, a possible theory has emerged: instead of raising wages, companies are giving out bonuses and adding benefits.\n\nDon't get your hopes up, experts say.\n\n\"I'm not aware of any evidence that shows that bonuses as a general matter are increasing or that they're a substitute for wages,\" said Seth Harris, a deputy labor secretary under former President Barack Obama.", "More than 3 million French and German troops were among an estimated 10 million soldiers who died in the Great War of 1914-1918.

Those losses have pushed it deeper into a bear market, having plunged nearly 22 percent from its 52-week high.\n\nSuch a steep sell-off has made a mess of the commodity's charts, says Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak.\n\n\"Obviously when you get a 20 percent decline, you definitely get some technical damage,\" Maley said on CNBC's \"Trading Nation\" on Friday.\n\n\"Not only have we broken below the 200-day moving average that a lot of people have talked about but, much more importantly, we've broken below the trend line going back to the early 2016 lows so that's a problem,\" he said.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell sharply below its 200-day moving average at the beginning of the month. The commodity had not traded significantly below that level since the summer of 2017.\n\n\"What's the next support level? That doesn't come in until you get down to the $57.50 level. That was the February lows... You break below that, we've got real problems,\" said Maley.\n\nCrude would need to drop another 4.4 percent before reaching that level.

Its next installment of the franchise, \"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,\" is due out Nov 16.\n\nThis enthusiasm for all things Harry Potter is expected to continue.

While the \"Fantastic Beasts\" series is expected to generate billions of dollars over the course of its multi-year run, the true test for Warner Bros. comes in the form of fan engagement.\n\nIt is not enough for these films to be good, they have to inspire fans to buy the merchandise, attend the amusement parks and see the movies multiple times.\n\nFans of Harry Potter have not been shy about rewarding companies that create new content for them to devour \u2014 theme parks, tours and merchandise to showcase their love of the franchise. Yet while the returns on \"Fantastic Beasts\" have been good so far, they don't quite measure up to the performance of the movies in the first Harry Potter series.\n\nTwo years ago, moviegoers worldwide shelled out more than $814 million to see \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\" the first film in the series \u2014 and that's not counting the $58 million spent on DVD and Blu-ray copies of the film.\n\nThe final film in the original series, \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,\" alone garnered more than $1.3 billion at the box office in 2011.", "Notable alums include co-founder David He, an MIT researcher who went on to become the technical lead at Alphabet's health tech group, Verily, bringing at least three top engineers with him.

The first digit signifies the network and industry, so for example, all Visas start with a \"4,\" while AmEx cards start with a \"3.\" That allows the merchants to identify who is ultimately responsible for payment of charges.\n\nThe first digit, along with the five that follow it, are collectively known as the Bank Identification Number, or BIN.

And with the option to store multiple fingerprints or facial appearances, couples are lending a finger for easing unlocking of their significant other's device.\n\n\"I think that inherently, people desire to share themselves and to be known. Sharing your phone fingerprints demonstrates trust between two people, and that you are OK with being known by that person, and that they're OK with you knowing them too,\" said Emma Clarke, a 24-year-old living in New York City who's previously swapped fingerprint biometrics with a boyfriend to access his phone.\n\n\"People like having a special connection with someone that others don't have and showing it off. It's the modern version of putting your boyfriend in your top friends on MySpace,\" Clarke said.\n\nMost of the young couples I talked to noted the convenience of having one-tap access to a significant other's phone. Switch the song while she's driving, check the recipe while his hands are busy cooking. Her phone has apps his doesn't.\n\nStill, sharing a numerical code could grant access for those occasions, which is what several 30-plus-year-old couples told me. Several Gen Xers or Baby Boomers I asked hadn't ever considered swapping fingerprints, and weren't easily convinced by a list of conveniences.\n\nStoring a partner's biometric data seems to be a uniquely younger compulsion, and likely tied to the typical millennial nonchalance around cybersecurity that comes with a digital childhood and regular headlines of data breaches. Younger generations are more used to, even more comfortable with, the risk of having sensitive information stolen, so sharing an otherwise strong security metric doesn't register as risky.", "Unofficial vote tallies in Florida's elections were due by midday Saturday, which could prompt recounts in the hotly contested races for governor and U.S. Senate.\n\nAt stake was the tight and acrimonious U.S. Senate race between Republican Gov. Rick Scott and incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson. The governor's race between former Republican U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis and the Democratic mayor of Tallahassee, Andrew Gillum, might also face a recount.\n\nThe recounts reflect a deeply divided electorate in a state that will play a critical role in the 2020 election and will determine whether Nelson will return to Washington for a fourth term or the Republicans will pad their majority in the Senate.\n\nGillum conceded to DeSantis on Tuesday night, but when the results began to narrow, he said every vote should count. DeSantis has said little about the recount and is instead proceeding as if he won the election, appointing a transition team and preparing to take office in January.\n\nThe battle for Nelson's Senate seat has been much more heated, with both sides filing lawsuits and trading verbal jabs. Scott has said Nelson is trying to steal the election, while Nelson is accusing Scott of trying to stop elections officials from counting every ballot. President Donald Trump has weighed in on behalf of Scott, calling the situation \"a disgrace.\"\n\nScott had asked Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate elections departments in South Florida's Democrat-leaning Broward and Palm Beach counties after his lead narrowed in ballot-counting that continued through the week. However, a spokeswoman for the agency said Friday that there were no credible allegations of fraud; therefore, no active investigation.\n\nThe governor, meanwhile, filed lawsuits in both counties seeking more information on how their ballots were being tallied. Nelson filed his own federal lawsuit Friday, seeking to postpone the Saturday deadline to submit unofficial election results.\n\nJudges sided with Scott in rulings late Friday ordering election supervisors in the two counties to release information on ballot-counting sought by the governor.\n\nMeanwhile, the Broward Canvassing Board met Friday to review ballots that had been initially deemed ineligible. Lawyers from the campaigns, journalists and citizens crowded into a room to observe the proceedings.\n\nScott's lead had narrowed by Friday evening to 0.18 percentage points \u2014a lead of less than 15,000 out of nearly 8.2 million ballots cast \u2014 below the threshold for a recount. Florida law requires a machine recount when the leading candidate's margin is 0.5 percentage points or less, and a hand recount if it's 0.25 or less.\n\nIn the race for governor, DeSantis was leading by 0.43 percentage points late Friday.\n\nA third statewide race that could go to a recount \u2014 the agriculture commissioner race between Democrat Nikki Fried and Republican Matt Caldwell \u2014 is the tightest of all, with Fried holding a 3,120-vote lead, a margin of 0.039 percent.", "Concept cars have been a staple of the automotive landscape for decades. Manufacturers use them to pique consumers' interest, but also to showcase new technology and features they hope to unveil in later production cars.\n\nThat was certainly the case with the 1938 Buick Y-Job, one of the world's first concepts. The Y-Job employed a vertical waterfall grill that would become a signature of the Buick brand for decades and more importantly, helped introduce features \u2014 like electric windows, the powered convertible top and recessed door handles \u2014 that would eventually become common on mainstream production cars.\n\nInnovation didn't stop in the late 1930s. Both new and established manufacturers present futuristic concept cars regularly. Some of these will be on display later this month at the Los Angeles Auto Show, the last big international vehicle expo of 2018.\n\nWe looked at some of the most interesting concept vehicles today and the technology and features that help make them stand out \u2014 or fly, literally.", "The San Francisco Bay Area is home to the least churchgoing population in the United States. According to the Barna Research Group, 61% of residents do not attend church.\n\nBut there's a group of religious leaders and savvy businesspeople out to change that. The Exponential Conference recently came to the Bay Area for the second year in a row. This gathering is meant to catalyze evangelical Christian leaders to start new churches. It's a practice called \"church planting\" and the goal of the conference, as the name suggests, is the exponential growth of the religious community.\n\nTurns out, building up a successful congregation in the Bay Area involves detailed business plans, sleek websites, intentional social media branding, podcasts of sermons, and lots of upbeat Christian rock.\n\nVMware CEO Pat Gelsinger is the Chairman of the Board at a group called Transforming the Bay with Christ. This coalition of business leaders, venture capitalists, non-profit leaders and pastors aims to convert one million people over the next decade. In order to so, it hopes to raise $15 million for what it calls it's Start-up Church Fund. Gelsinger donates nearly half his annual income to charity, much of it directed to church planting organizations.\n\nAs Gelsinger says about his dual roles, \"I'm the full time minister of VMWare and I have 23,000 souls that are under my leadership.\"", "With five NBA Championships, an Olympic gold medal and various MVP awards to his name, Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson will go down as one of the greatest basketball players of all time. But the former Laker may be remembered for his business skills as well as his signature hook shot.\n\nSince retiring from basketball in 1991, Johnson has focused on building Magic Johnson Enterprises, a billion-dollar conglomerate he formed in 1987 that invests in a variety of companies and owns Burger King restaurants, health clubs and professional sports teams. From 1998 to 2010, Johnson's company owned more than 100 Starbucks stores.\n\nThe deal he struck with the former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz \"is what really stamped me as serious businessman,\" Johnson tells Maverick Carter in an episode of \"Kneading Dough,\" presented by Uninterrupted. But the deal took work \u2014 and a bit of creativity.\n\nJohnson wanted to bring Starbucks to the inner city, and he had to convince Schultz that his coffee shops would prosper there. His boardroom pitch wasn't enough to win Schultz over, so he changed his strategy and invited the CEO to one of the movie theaters he owned at the time.", "Turkey has given recordings related to the killing of Jamal Khashoggi to Germany, France, and Britain, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday, seeking to maintain international pressure on Riyadh over the Saudi journalist's death.\n\nKhashoggi, a critic of de facto Saudi ruler Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed in Saudi Arabia's Istanbul consulate last month in a hit which Erdogan says was ordered at the \"highest levels\" of the Saudi government.\n\nHis killing provoked global outrage but little concrete action by world powers against Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter and a supporter of Washington's plans to contain Iranian influence across the Middle East.\n\nSpeaking as he left Turkey to attend World War One commemorations in France which are being attended by President Donald Trump and European leaders, Erdogan said for the first time that the three European Union states had heard the recordings.\n\n\"We gave the tapes. We gave them to Saudi Arabia, to the United States, Germans, French and British, all of them. They have listened to all the conversations in them. They know,\" Erdogan said.\n\nCIA director Gina Haspel heard an audio recording of Khashoggi's death when she visited Istanbul, two sources told Reuters last month. A senior Saudi envoy was also played a recording, a source familiar with the matter said.\n\nErdogan did not give details of the contents of the tapes on Saturday but two sources with knowledge of the issue have told Reuters that Turkey has several audio recordings.\n\nThey include the killing itself and conversations pre-dating the operation which Turkey subsequently uncovered, the sources said. These had led Ankara to conclude from an early stage that the killing was premeditated, despite Saudi Arabia's initial denials of any knowledge or involvement.\n\nSaudi Arabia's prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb has since said Khashoggi's killing was planned in advance, although another Saudi official said Prince Mohammed had no knowledge of the specific operation.", "Authorities trying to make sense of why a gunman killed 12 people at a Southern California bar are not publicly discussing what they've learned, but at least one Instagram post he made after beginning the massacre has emerged as an early focus.\n\nSocial media platforms have scrubbed that and any other posts following Wednesday night's massacre. But one law enforcement official said Ian David Long, a 28-year-old former Marine, posted about his mental state and whether people would believe he was sane.\n\nAuthorities also were investigating whether he believed his former girlfriend would be at the Borderline Bar and Grill, said the official, who was briefed on the investigation but not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nA second law enforcement official, Ventura County Sheriff's Capt. Garo Kuredjian, said that \u2014 based on time stamps \u2014 the gunman apparently stopped shooting inside the bar and posted to Instagram. Kuredjian said he didn't know the content of any posts. Instagram and Facebook typically refuse to discuss individual accounts and did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAuthorities described an attack of military efficiency. None of those injured was hurt by gunfire. When the gunman shot his .45-caliber pistol, he killed. As scores of police officers closed in, Long apparently shot and killed himself.\n\nSeveral people who knew Long in the suburb of Thousand Oaks where the gunman went to high school and eventually moved back in with his mother described him in disturbing terms.\n\nLong made others feel uncomfortable going back to his teens.\n\nDominique Colell, who coached girls' track and field at the high school where Long was a sprinter, remembers an angry young man who could be verbally and physically combative.\n\nIn one instance, Colell said Long used his fingers to mimic shooting her in the back of the head as she talked to another athlete. In another, he grabbed her rear and midsection after she refused to return a cellphone he said was his.\n\n\"I literally feared for myself around him,\" Colell said in an interview Friday. \"He was the only athlete that I was scared of.\"\n\nColell said she wanted to kick Long off the team, but the boy's coach urged her to reconsider because that could compromise his goal of joining the Marines. She relented when, at the next track meet, Long apologized in front of several coaches and administrators.\n\nAttempts to get comment by phone and in person from officials at Newbury Park High School and its school district were unsuccessful. Both were closed because of a destructive wildfire in the area.\n\nAs investigators worked to figure out what set him off, President Donald Trump blamed mental illness, describing the gunman as \"a very sick puppy\" who had \"a lot of problems.\" At the White House on Friday, Trump touted his efforts to fund work on post-traumatic stress disorder among veterans and ignored questions about stricter gun control laws.\n\nInvestigators have not commented on whether mental illness played a role in the rampage. But a mental health specialist who assessed Long after sheriff's deputies responded to a call about his agitated behavior last spring worried he might be suffering from PTSD.\n\nThe incident happened in April, when yelling and loud banging noises coming from the home Long shared with his mother prompted a next-door neighbor to call authorities. The mental health specialist concluded there were no grounds to have him involuntarily committed.\n\nAmong the dead in the shooting rampage were a sheriff's sergeant gunned down as he entered the bar and a U.S. Navy veteran who survived last year's massacre in which a gunman in a high-rise Las Vegas hotel killed 58 people at an outdoor country music festival.", "U.S. Senate Democrats are considering legal action over President Donald Trump's appointment of a new acting attorney general, congressional sources said on Friday, as some outside experts called the move unconstitutional.\n\nTrump on Wednesday named Matthew Whitaker to replace former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was forced out after months of attacks by Trump for recusing himself from an ongoing probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe move made Whitaker supervisor of the investigation, which has hung over Trump's presidency. Whitaker has criticized the probe in the past as too wide-ranging, which has raised concerns among Democrats that Sessions' ouster and Whitaker's appointment might be precursors to Trump moving to end it.\n\nSenate Democrats were considering suing Trump, the sources said, on the grounds that, in naming Whitaker, the president ignored a statutory line of succession at the Justice Department and deprived senators of their constitutional \"advice and consent\" role on some presidential appointments.\n\n\"The only two paths to that office are regular succession, and advice (and) consent,\" said a source close to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nDemocratic Senator Richard Blumenthal told Reuters late on Friday he was \"considering action that might be brought against an interim appointment that violates the normal statutory line of succession and raises very serious constitutional questions.\"\n\nHe said he was speaking only for himself and he hoped Republicans might join as plaintiffs if a lawsuit goes forward.\n\nThe Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution states that some senior government officials, known as \"principal officers,\" must be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nA spokesman for Senate Judiciary chairman Chuck Grassley said Trump had the authority to appoint Whitaker as acting attorney general temporarily, even though he had not been confirmed by the Senate.\n\nSuch appointments can be done for senior officials who have worked in the department for at least 90 days and can last for up to 210 days, spokesman George Hartmann said.\n\nAs the minority party in the Senate, Democrats might need some Republican support to have legal standing to sue Trump under the Appointments Clause, said Andrew Wright, who was a White House lawyer under former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe source close to the Senate Judiciary Committee said Democrats were unsure whether they would reach out to Republicans to join the lawsuit, but added it was \"not likely.\"\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, who earlier this year introduced legislation to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is conducting the probe, said Whitaker did not pose a threat to his work.\n\n\"Mueller will be allowed to do his job,\" Graham said in a Friday interview on Fox News Radio.\n\nJohn Yoo, a former Justice Department lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, said \"the Supreme Court made clear that the Attorney General is a principal officer\" in a 1998 case.\n\n\"Therefore, Whitaker cannot serve as acting Attorney General ... Any other officer in the Justice Department who was appointed through advice and consent can serve, including the Deputy AG, the solicitor general, and the assistant AGs,\" said Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a career Justice Department official already confirmed by the Senate, should have been named the new attorney general.", "U.S. President Donald Trump and France's Emmanuel Macron agreed on Saturday on the need for more European defense spending, papering over an earlier Trump tweet that had described Macron's call for a European army as \"very insulting.\"\n\nMeeting for talks at the Elysee a day before commemorations to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One, Macron welcomed Trump under rainy Parisian skies with a firm handshake. But there appeared to be less immediate warmth in the greeting between the two than in the past.\n\nSeated on gilded chairs in the ornate presidential palace, Macron placed his hand on Trump's knee and referred to him as \"my friend,\" while Trump kept more distance, although he also talked up common ground on an issue that had caused friction.\n\n\"We want a strong Europe, it's very important to us, and whichever way we can do it the best and more efficient would be something we both want,\" said Trump.\n\n\"We want to help Europe but it has to be fair. Right now the burden sharing has been largely on the United States.\"\n\nMacron echoed those sentiments, saying he wanted Europe to bear a greater share of the defense costs within NATO, a point he has made repeatedly since taking office, alongside his ambitions for Europe to have its own military capability.\n\n\"That's why I do believe my proposals for European defense are totally consistent with that,\" Macron said in English.\n\nFresh off U.S. congressional elections that saw his Republican Party's power eroded, Trump's visit is aimed at bolstering the U.S.-European alliance at a symbolic time, with the world marking the centenary of World War One's armistice.\n\nBut in a tweet prior to landing in Paris, Trump took a dim view of comments Macron made in a Europe 1 radio interview this week in which he appeared to cast the United States as a threat.\n\nDiscussing the growing dangers from cyber-hacking, meddling in electoral processes and the U.S. decision to withdraw from a missile treaty, Macron said Europe needed to protect itself against China, Russia \"and even the United States.\"\n\nLater in the interview he spoke about the need for a European army, saying:\n\n\"Faced by Russia, which is on our borders and which has shown that it can be threatening... we need to have a Europe that can better defend itself by itself, without depending solely on the United States.\"\n\nTrump, who has pushed NATO allies to pay more for common defense and not rely on the United States, complained.\n\n\"Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly,\" Trump said on Twitter.\n\nThe Elysee said the misunderstanding, which it said had been caused by \"exaggerated\" U.S. press reports, was cleared up during more than an hour of talks it described as \"substantial\" and \"very constructive.\"\n\n\"We had a great discussion and we are aligned,\" the Elysee quoted Trump as saying during the meeting, which covered trade, defense, Syria and the fallout from the murder in Istanbul last month of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.", "Two monster wildfires in California, including the most destructive in state history, burned out of control on Saturday, having already killed at least nine people, destroyed scores of buildings and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes.\n\nNine people were found dead in and around the Northern California town of Paradise, where more than 6,700 homes and businesses were burned down by the 100,000-acre (40,470-hectare) Camp Fire, the state's most destructive on record, authorities said.\n\nIn Paradise, which had about 26,000 residents, the fire destroyed most homes and half the businesses, the town's mayor Jody Jones said on CNN, describing a long period of recovery ahead.\n\n\"It's going to be a process, a lot of hard work, a lot of coming together, but we want to see Paradise be paradise again,\" Jones told CNN.", "On foreign policy matters, President Donald Trump through this week's midterm elections has demonstrated a refreshing willingness to take on critical issues that his predecessors either avoided altogether or ineffectually kicked down the road.\n\nHis tactics can lack diplomatic elegance (mostly by intention) and anger partners, but it's undeniable he has locked his legacy-seeking sights on what looks to be an overwhelming list of long-festering problems. Among them: NATO allies' unwillingness to bear sufficient defense burdens, China's unfair trade practices, Russia's violation of a short and intermediate-range missile treaty, North Korea's nuclear proliferation and Iran's dangerously malign behavior.\n\nOf all those issues, the Iran showdown provides the most dramatic lens through which to track whether President Trump can turn his disruptive determination into a strategic outcome of lasting significance. Without minimizing the other challenges, my wager is that the Iran issue may become the Trump administration's most defining foreign policy challenge over the coming two years, viewed alongside North Korea as part of a dual effort to counter rogue regimes.\n\nThat's because, first, Iran is the issue where there is the greatest alignment among top Trump administration officials on the significance and urgency of the threat. President Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Secretary of Defense James Mattis and National Security Advisor John Bolton may disagree occasionally on tactics or the achievable end-game, but not on the priority.\n\nSecond, the administration has begun to execute a comprehensive, three-pronged \"maximum pressure\" campaign to alter Iran's behavior, driven by the resourceful and tireless Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative to Iran and senior advisor to Secretary Pompeo.\n\nA senior U.S. official says that approach involves intensifying diplomatic engagement to bring about greater international support and sanctions compliance, increasing deterrence against Iranian behavior by more aggressively going after the money, missiles and arms fueling its regional influence, and heightening efforts to be seen as \"standing with the Iranian people,\" who have wearied of their leaders' corruption and costly misadventures beyond Iran.", "Standing side by side, top U.S. officials urged their Chinese counterparts on Friday to halt militarization of the disputed South China Sea, drawing a rebuke from the Chinese for sending U.S. warships close to islands claimed by Beijing.\n\nDuring a round of high-level talks in Washington, the two sides aired in sometimes blunt terms many of their main differences, including a bitter trade dispute, freedom of navigation in Asia-Pacific waters, self-ruled Taiwan, and China's crackdown on its Muslim minority in Xinjiang.\n\nTwo visiting senior Chinese officials also seized the opportunity to warn publicly that a trade war between the world's two largest economies would end up hurting both sides and to call for keeping channels of communication open to resolve an issue that has unsettled global financial markets.\n\nDespite the airing of grievances, the talks appeared aimed at controlling the damage to relations that has worsened in recent months and at paving the way for an encounter between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 summit in Argentina at the end of November.\n\n\"The United States is not pursuing a Cold War or containment policy with respect to China,\" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told a joint news conference.\n\nEven as the United States and China confront difficult challenges, \"cooperation remains essential on many issues,\" he said, citing efforts to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear program.", "A Somali-born man who set fire to a truck laden with gas cylinders in the center of Melbourne and fatally stabbed one person was inspired by Islamic State but did not have direct links with the group, police in Australia said on Saturday.\n\nPolice identified the man responsible for Friday's attack as 30-year-old Hassan Khalif Shire Ali and said he was radicalized and inspired by the militant group's propaganda. He was shot by police and died in hospital.\n\nPolice said Shire Ali's Australian passport was canceled in 2015 after an intelligence report he planned to travel to Syria, but an assessment was made that while he had radical views, he posed no threat to national security.\n\nIslamic State had claimed responsibility for the attack, which came two days before Remembrance Day, marking 100 years since the end of World War One, without providing any evidence.\n\n\"I think it is fair to say he (Shire Ali) was inspired. He was radicalized,\" Australian Federal Police Acting Deputy Commissioner Ian McCartney told reporters in Melbourne.\n\n\"We're not saying there was direct contact. We're saying it was more from an inspiration perspective.\"\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said the national terrorism advisory remained at \"probable,\" the midpoint of a five-tier system, and told reporters in Sydney that radical Islam was the issue.\n\n\"I need to call it out.

It said the names of candidates will be called before Nov. 26, and the election held on Jan. 5. The new Parliament is to be convened on Jan. 17.\n\nSri Lanka has been in a political crisis since Oct. 26, when Sirisena fired his prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and replaced him with former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa.\n\nWickremesinghe has insisted his firing is unconstitutional. He has refused to vacate his official residence and demanded that Parliament be summoned immediately to prove he had support among its members.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister. Sirisena has also accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, a charge Wickremesinghe repeatedly denied.\n\nSirisena was also critical of investigations into military personnel accused of human rights violations during Sri Lanka's long civil war against a Tamil separatist group, which ended in 2009.\n\nSirisena had suspended Parliament for two weeks in a move Wickremesinghe's backers said was designed to buy time to shore up support. There were calls both locally and internationally to convene Parliament to end the impasse.\n\nAmid the pressure, Sirisena announced the legislature would be summoned Nov. 14. He maintained his choice for prime minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa, had a majority in Parliament. However, the decision to dissolve the house shows otherwise, observers say.\n\n\"The dissolution clearly indicates that Mr. Sirisena has grossly misjudged and miscalculated the support that he might or could secure to demonstrate support in the Parliament,\" said Bharath Gopalaswamy, director at U.S.-based analyst group Atlantic Council's South Asia Center.\n\n\"At the end of the day, he is a victim of his own homegrown crisis.\"\n\nWickremesinghe's camp is likely to contest Sirisena's move because of constitutional provisions stating a Parliament can't be dissolved until 4 1/2 years after its election.

The company said it only affects the original iPhone X, which has been superseded by the iPhone XS and XR released this autumn.\n\nThe screens on affected phones may not respond correctly to touch or it could react even without being touched, the Cupertino, California-based company said.\n\nFor the 13-inch MacBook Pro computers, it said an issue may result in data loss and failure of the storage drive. Apple said it would service those affected drives.\n\nOnly a limited number of 128GB and 256GB solid-state drives in 13-inch MacBook Pro units sold between June 2017 and June 2018 were affected, Apple said on its website.\n\nLast year, Apple began a massive battery replacement program after it conceded that a software update intended to help some iPhone models deal with aging batteries slowed down the performance of the phones.

In fact, Chinese consumption has become increasingly important for its regional neighbors, according to Louis Kuijs, head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics.\n\n\"For most Asian economies, exports to meet Chinese domestic demand have risen much more rapidly than indirect exports via supply chains, with the former now exceeding the latter,\" Kuijs said in a report Thursday.\n\n\"The significant amount of Asian exports used in China's own economy means that in assessing the impact of a U.S.-China trade war, we should expect the effect via China's domestic demand to play a key role,\" he added.\n\nAnd while Chinese policy responses to support domestic demand \u2014 as well as the relocation of some manufacturers to Southeast Asia \u2014 may mitigate some of the negative effects, other Asian economies are unlikely to avoid being hurt, he said.\n\n\"In any case, given the significance of its impact on most or all Asian economies, the U.S.-China trade war is likely to remain negative for the region over the coming two years,\" Kuijs said.", "Cramer\u2019s Exec Cut: The battle between humans and automation looks different at each company\n\n7:12 PM ET Fri, 9 Nov 2018\n\nJim Cramer discusses the massive shift online with Etsy, Take-Two, and ANGI Homeservices.", "Cramer Remix: Next week's earnings could make or break how the Fed approaches rate hikes 10:44 AM ET Mon, 12 Nov 2018 | 01:05\n\nMuch of Wall Street is worried that sliding oil prices could be a sign of global economic weakness, but CNBC's Jim Cramer offered a counter-theory on Friday as he prepared investors for the week ahead.\n\n\"I read the decline in oil as an issue of supply overwhelming demand, not demand waning,\" he said on \"Mad Money.\" \"When that happens, it's terrific for both consumers and for business.

Shares of the toymaker were down 21.45 percent by day-end on Friday after an earnings report that disappointed Wall Street.\n\nCalling his company \"an index fund of pop culture,\" Mariotti argued that his company's disruptive, passionate ethos and strong retail partnerships would help Funko's business this holiday season.\n\n\"We're in a great position inventory-wise with our retail partners, sell-through-wise with our retail partners,\" the CEO said, adding that Funko is positioned \"better year-over-year than we were last year.\"\n\n\"The appetite for our product is amazing on a global basis,\" he told Cramer. \"We're in great position for Q4 and we love what 2019 looks like.\"\n\nFunko is also exploring opportunities to move its factories out of China, but Mariotti stressed that tariffs aren't the deciding factor.\n\n\"We're not really concerned about the tariffs and that's not really our primary decision-making on why we're moving,\" he said. \"We're looking for the best factories that move the fastest, the highest quality, the best price, the most consistent production. It just happens to be a lot of that is working outside of China, and we figure by the end of next year, we should be about 70 percent of our manufacturing should reside outside of China.\"\n\nFunko's stock closed at $15.67 a share on Friday.

Well, let's just say it is always a risky proposition,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said Friday.\n\nShares of Crocs popped 27 percent in Thursday's trading session after the company reported third-quarter earnings with a surprise profit jump. Clog revenue \u2014 about half of the company's total income \u2014 grew by 12.7 percent. The shoemaker also announced a partnership with popular rapper Post Malone, a self-proclaimed fan of the shoes.\n\nThe success runs counter to rumors that Crocs was shutting down, floated after the company closed its last manufacturing store in August. After the closing, Crocs assured its fans that it wasn't going out of business and would continue manufacturing its products through third parties.\n\nCramer called the latest quarter \"phenomenal,\" touting the company's turnaround during a worldwide \"resurgence of substance over style.\" Helped by the rise of athleisure and celebrity promotions, Crocs' store count reduction, e-commerce initiatives and new product development has helped the company get back on its feet, he said.\n\nIn a recent Piper Jaffray survey tracking 8,600 teenagers' shopping preferences, the Crocs brand hit its highest level in recent history, ranking 13th among preferred shoe brands. In 2017, Crocs took 27th place.\n\nEven so, only investors who are comfortable with high-risk plays should venture into the stock, Cramer warned.\n\n\"It's not crazy to speculate on Crocs even up here, although, ideally, sure, you'd like to wait for a pullback before you pull the trigger,\" he advised. \"And don't even think about owning Crocs, please, with your retirement money \u2014 this is the kind of thing you only buy with funds that you can afford to lose.\"\n\nShares of Crocs traded lower on Friday, losing 7.24 percent and settling at $25.37 a share.

You're paying less at the pump; industry's paying less on the big bill.\"\n\nOil prices fell for their 10th consecutive trading session on Friday, cementing the longest losing streak for U.S. crude since mid-1984, according to Refinitiv data. On Thursday, Cramer said he could make a case for $40-a-barrel prices.\n\nBut considering the fact that the United States is producing 12 million barrels of oil a day, up significantly from past years, Cramer found it hard to believe that there was an issue with demand.\n\n\"I think lower oil actually creates a virtuous circle and that people are too negative. And it happened just like last time, where we learned ... that cheaper fuel is actually good for 90 percent of the S&P 500 as long as it's caused by excess supply,\" he said.\n\n\"So what do you do with your portfolio? Nothing,\" he continued. \"Let this nonsense play out. Get ready to buy some high-quality stocks of companies that benefit from lower oil.

Last year, it generated a whopping $25 billion in sales \u2014 all in just a 24-hour period of purchases.\n\nThat's a staggering figure, considering Cyber Monday in the U.S. generated $6.59 billion, while Black Friday saw $5 billion in online sales that same year.\n\nOther retailers have also jumped on the bandwagon.\n\nAlibaba's rival, Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com, generated $19 billion of sales in an 11-day period centered on Singles Day. Even American tech giant Amazon is promoting Singles Day now, sending out emails about the holiday in Singapore.\n\nHow did it get so big?\n\nIn 2009, Daniel Zhang, Alibaba Group's current CEO, launched the concept of offering discounts to consumers on Singles Day. The event, though, can be traced back even earlier, and is believed to have been started in 1993 at Nanjing University for students as a way to celebrate being single.\n\nFast forward to 2017: At its peak, Alibaba handled 256,000 transactions per second, and more than 775 million parcels were shipped from orders generated in that 24-hour period.\n\nThat growth can be partly attributed to China's huge population of nearly 1.4 billion people, as well as the rising middle-class that increasingly uses smartphones.\n\nAlibaba has also taken advantage of China's mobile-first market by live streaming events featuring celebrities and hosting fashion shows that appear on numerous social media platforms as well as several Chinese TV networks.\n\nLast year, Alibaba brought in celebrities including Nicole Kidman and Pharrell Williams to help with its midnight countdown to Singles Day.", "President Donald Trump dove into tight Senate and gubernatorial races in Florida, Arizona and Georgia on Friday, tweeting a series of unfounded claims apparently aimed at sowing doubt about the election results if Democrats ultimately prevailed.\n\nIn Florida, closely watched Senate and gubernatorial races seemed headed to recounts as slim leads held by Republicans Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis, respectively, tightened on Friday.

The Justice Department unsealed an indictment last week accusing Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho and an associate with laundering billions of dollars embezzled from the state investment fund known as 1MDB.\n\nGoldman Sachs is undergoing scrutiny for its role in the 1MDB scandal. The bank arranged three bond deals in 2012 and 2013 to fund 1MDB, raising $6.5 billion to supposedly attract foreign investment. Instead, Low is accused of paying bribes to officials and attempting to launder billions stolen from the fund. Goldman has said that bankers including Tim Leissner, who plead guilty to the scheme, deceived the firm and dodged its internal controls.\n\nThe 2009 meeting was an introduction between Blankfein and recently-elected Prime Minister of Malaysia Najib Razak to talk about trade and investments, according to the person. Such meetings are commonplace for investment bank leaders. Low, known as \"Jho Low,\" was one of about 12 attendees of that meeting.\n\nBlankfein also moderated a discussion with Najib in 2013 held with private equity firms in New York.

It said focusing on its signature packaged food would help regain its financial footing. The decision came despite pressure from activist fund Third Point, which initially said the only justifiable outcome of the review was a sale to a strategic buyer. Third Point has since said it would also accept other moves for Campbell, including a breakup.\n\nCampbell has sent out materials to tease the sale of its Australian Arnott's biscuits business and Kelsen baked snacks that could fetch $2.5 billion to $3 billion from buyers. The biscuit and cracker maker is the largest in Australia and has therefore caught the eye of a number food companies that are eyeing global expansion as challenged U.S. grocers continue to exert their pressure.\n\nFood companies \u2014 including Oreo-owner Mondelez, Kraft Heinz and Ferrero, which owns Nutella \u2014 are among those eyeing the business, the people said.\n\nSnacks have become increasingly important for food companies to buy as more and more people eat on-the-go and sales of grocery staples, like cereal, have slowed. In the U.S., though, there are few brands available to buy to move the needle for companies that generate billions in annual sales.\n\nArnott's gives buyers a chance to buy a large business in an established market. Still, with Australia relatively isolated, it would also likely require a buyer with an existing global footprint and may also limit their ability to expand the brand further into other international markets like China, say people familiar with the industry.\n\nCampbell expects to sign non-disclosure agreements for its international snack business in the next weeks, and will then begin to send out confidential materials, the people said. This will launch a formal sale process. While such processes take weeks, it remains possible a keenly interested party could expedite it by lobbing in a particularly high bid, some of the people said.\n\nOne likely consideration in the sale process is potential anti-trust issues due to Arnott's hold on the Australian cookie market.

Justin McCurry, a father of three based in Raleigh, North Carolina, quit his engineering job in 2013 and retired at age 33. His wife, Kaisorn, joined him in early retirement in 2016 at age 38.\n\n\"Neither of us ever reached a six figure salary, with my salary topping out at $69,000 and [Kaisorn's] at $74,000,\" Justin writes on his blog, Root of Good, which explains how he saved more than $1 million in 10 years to retire early.\n\n\"No winning lottery tickets or inheritances, either,\" he says. \"Just steady saving and investing in our low cost index fund portfolio year after year.\"\n\nTheir journey to early retirement began in 2004, when Justin graduated from law school and landed a job at an engineering consulting firm. Kaisorn was still in law school, meaning their combined annual income was Justin's $48,000 salary. They had a good bit in savings already: Between the two of them, they had accumulated $49,000 from investments during college and grad school.\n\nOver the next decade, thanks to incremental raises and careful saving and investing, their portfolio grew to more than $1.3 million, enough to support their modest lifestyle in retirement.", "Residents affected by the three fires scorching parts of California have yet another ordeal to contend with: beginning the homeowners' insurance claims process.\n\nTwo of the blazes \u2014 the Hill Fire and the Woolsey Fire \u2014 ignited in southern California on Thursday, setting off evacuations, according to the Ventura County Fire Department.\n\nMeanwhile, the Camp Fire moved through northern California on Thursday, forcing thousands of residents to flee and engulfing the city of Paradise.\n\nAll three of the fires continued to burn through on Friday.\n\nThe one bright spot for homeowners is this: As long as you've been paying your premiums, the standard homeowner's insurance policy covers fire damage to your home, structures on your property and most of your belongings.\n\nCertain specialty items, such as art or jewelry, might need a rider in order to be covered.\n\nHere's what you should look out for if you're preparing to file an insurance claim after you've lost everything.", "More than 250,000 people in California were under evacuation orders statewide as of Friday evening due to growing wind-whipped fires which have burned over 6,600 homes and led to at least nine fatalities, according to officials.\n\nThere are at least three major wildfires burning in California, stretching California's firefighting resources thin and leading authorities on Friday to ask for help from several Western states. One of the fires devastated communities in Ventura County and as of Friday afternoon was burning out of control and destroying multiple structures in the Calabasas and Malibu areas of Los Angeles County.\n\n\"Weather-wise we are literally in a statewide 'red flag' weather warning,\" said Mark Ghilarducci, director of the California Office of Emergency Services. \"Fire weather conditions are extreme. We are literally seeing it from border to border.\"\n\nOver 250,000 people are under evacuation orders in Southern California, mostly from the so-called Woolsey fire. Another 52,000 people are under evacuation in Northern California's Butte County from a blaze authorities have dubbed the Camp fire, which is blamed for the loss of more than 6,000 homes and nine fatalities.\n\nAuthorities estimate the Woosley blaze destroyed approximately 150 homes. However, those numbers were expected to grow as the massive fire continues to rage with zero containment.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Coroner's office reported late Friday two bodies were found in the Malibu area, although the agency couldn't immediately confirm the fatalities were due to the fire.\n\nThe entire city of Malibu was under mandatory evacuation Friday as flames threatened nearby homes and other structures. After burning homes in Bell Canyon, Oak Park and Thousand Oaks, the fire crossed the 101 Freeway from the Ventura County line on Friday morning and within hours led to the evacuation of the entire city of Malibu, where many celebrities have homes.\n\nCher was one of the celebrities who tweeted about her home being in harm's way. Actor Orlando Bloom also posted on Instagram about the blaze being near his residence.\n\nEvacuations remained in effect in several Ventura County communities as of Friday evening, including portions of Westlake Village, Hidden Hills, Calabasas, Oak Park, Thousand Oaks and Agoura Hills.", "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sent a letter Friday to President Donald Trump questioning whether the appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker was constitutional.\n\nWhitaker, who was then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions' chief of staff, was promoted after Sessions' ouster was revealed Wednesday. Sessions, whom Trump regularly vented his rage at in tweets and interviews, wrote in a letter to the president that he had resigned \"at your request.\"\n\nThe announcement came less than a day after Republicans lost their majority control of the House in the midterm elections, and quickly sparked heated criticism from legal experts and Democratic lawmakers.\n\n\"Mr. Whitaker is a political appointee who is not serving in a Senate confirmed position in the Justice Department. I am not aware of any precedent for appointment of an official who has not been confirmed by the Senate to serve as Acting Attorney General,\" Schumer, D-N.Y.,wrote in his letter to Trump.\n\nHe also raised the possibility that Whitaker's appointment violated a clause in the U.S. Constitution requiring the president to appoint certain officials only \"with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.\"\n\nSome lawyers have argued that Whitaker is a \"principal officer,\" as opposed to \"inferior officers,\" for whom the Constitution gives the president the power to appoint without Senate confirmation.\n\nAmong those questioning the move are Neal Katyal, former acting solicitor general in the Obama administration, and George Conway, an attorney \u2014 and husband of Trump's senior advisor, Kellyanne Conway.\n\n\"A principal officer must be confirmed by the Senate. And that has a very significant consequence today,\" the two lawyers wrote in a New York Times op-ed Thursday. \"It means that Mr. Trump's installation of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general of the United States after forcing the resignation of Jeff Sessions is unconstitutional. It's illegal. And it means that anything Mr. Whitaker does, or tries to do, in that position is invalid.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to CNBC's request for comment on Conway's op-ed.\n\nSchumer appears to adopt a similar stance in his letter to Trump. \"The Attorney General, as head of the Department of Justice, is unquestionably a principal officer,\" Schumer said. \"It is not clear to me how your appointment of an unconfirmed official as Acting Attorney General comports with this constitutional mandate \u2013 either on its face or intent.\"\n\nWhitaker, 49, was indeed confirmed by the Senate \u2014 in 2004, when he became a U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Iowa. But Whitaker tendered his resignation to former President Barack Obama in 2009.\n\nSchumer notes that Peter Keisler was appointed acting attorney general in 2007 without a separate Senate confirmation, but said that Keisler \"was already serving in a Senate-confirmed position in the Department.\"\n\nWhitaker was reportedly appointed under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which allows him to remain acting attorney general for up to 210 days. But depending on when Trump nominates a permanent replacement, Whitaker could remain in the role longer as the nomination process is carried out.\n\nExperts have also questioned the Trump administration's use of this act, arguing that the law may not apply if Sessions was indeed fired by Trump. Even if it does, some say, the line of succession would put Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in the acting role. Rosenstein oversaw the Mueller probe after Sessions recused himself, but the DOJ said Whitaker will now oversee the investigation.\n\nSchumer also expressed concern about Whitaker's fitness to serve in an acting capacity as the chief law enforcement official in the U.S., given his \"specific expressions of bias against\" special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.\n\nWhitaker has critiqued the Mueller probe of Russian interference during the 2016 U.S. presidential election on multiple occasions. He wrote an op-ed for CNN in August 2017 arguing that if Mueller looked into the Trump family's finances \"without a broadened scope in his appointment, then this would raise serious concerns that the special counsel's investigation was a mere witch hunt.\"\n\nWhitaker also appeared to defend Trump campaign officials' meeting with Kremlin-connected Russians at Trump Tower in June 2016, saying: \"There is no federal crime of collusion. So we're either looking at espionage charges, which seems farcical with the evidence we have now, or we're looking at campaign finance violations, but I still don't see how there's anything of value there.\"\n\nIn June 2017, Whitaker said on a radio show that \"the truth is, there was no collusion with the Russians and the Trump campaign,\" Politico reported.\n\nHis remarks have led to numerous calls from Democrats and legal experts alike for Whitaker to recuse himself from the probe. But The Washington Post reported Thursday that he has no intention of recusing himself, citing people close to the new acting attorney general. Jay Sekulow, Trump's lawyer in the Mueller probe, said Thursday that Whitaker's promotion will have \"no effect day-to-day\" on the special counsel, Bloomberg reported.\n\nSchumer's letter included five questions for Trump, asking him why he chose Whitaker and whether he had discussed the Mueller probe with him, among others.\n\nTrump appeared to respond to some of those questions in remarks to reporters Friday morning en route to Paris for events commemorating the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.\n\n\"I don't know Matt Whitaker,\" the president said repeatedly. But Whitaker \"is a very highly respected man. You didn't have any problems when he worked for Jeff Sessions. He's respected by law enforcement. He's a very strong law enforcement personality and person,\" Trump added.\n\nAsked whether Whitaker should have been confirmed by the Senate, Trump turned the question on Mueller: \"Mueller was not Senate confirmed. Why didn't they get him Senate confirmed? He should've been Senate confirmed.\"\n\nKatyal and Conway argued in their op-ed, and in prior writings, that \"What makes an officer a principal officer is that he or she reports only to the president. No one else in government is that person's boss. But Mr. Mueller reports to Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general. So, Mr. Mueller is what is known as an inferior officer, not a principal one, and his appointment without Senate approval was valid.\"\n\nRead the full text of the letter below, or download it here.", "E-cigarette manufacturer Juul will stop selling fruity flavors like mango and cucumber from brick-and-mortar stores in response to the Food and Drug Administration's request to curb \"epidemic\" levels of teen vaping, according to a person briefed on the company's plan.\n\nJuul will pull its mango, cucumber, fruit and creme flavored nicotine pods from convenience store and other retailers, said the person, who asked not to be named because the proposal is not yet public.

Shares of companies that would ship oil on the pipeline also fell.\n\nTransCanada said in a statement it remains committed to building the $8 billion, 1,180 mile (1,900 km) pipeline, but it has also said it is seeking other investors and has not taken a final investment decision.\n\nThe ruling drew an angry response from Trump, who approved the pipeline shortly after taking office. It also piles pressure on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to assist the country's ailing oil sector.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris wrote that a U.S. State Department environmental analysis of Keystone XL \"fell short of a 'hard look\"' at the cumulative effects of greenhouse gas emissions and the impact on Native American land resources.\n\n\"It was a political decision made by a judge. I think it's a disgrace,\" Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\nThe ruling was a win for environmental groups who sued the U.S. government in 2017 after Trump announced a presidential permit for the project. Tribal groups and ranchers also have spent more than a decade fighting the planned pipeline.\n\n\"The Trump administration tried to force this dirty pipeline project on the American people, but they can't ignore the threats it would pose to our clean water, our climate, and our communities,\" said the Sierra Club.\n\nThe U.S. State Department, which could appeal the ruling, could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe pipeline would carry heavy crude from Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska, where it would connect to refineries in the U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast, as well as Gulf export terminals.\n\nShares of Canadian oil producers Canadian Natural Resources Ltd and Cenovus Energy shed 3 percent.\n\nCanada is the primary source of imported U.S. oil, but congested pipelines in Alberta, where the tar-like bitumen is extracted, have forced oil shippers to use costlier rail and trucks.\n\nSeveral pipeline projects have been scrapped due to opposition, and the Trans Mountain line project still faces delays even after the Canadian government purchased it this year to move it forward.\n\n\"You have to wonder how long investors will tolerate the delays and whether the Canadian government will intervene again to protect the industry,\" said Morningstar analyst Sandy Fielden.\n\nCanada, which has been trying to advance economic and environmental priorities at the same time, finds the ruling disappointing, said Vanessa Adams, a spokeswoman for Canada's Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi.\n\nEnsuring at least one pipeline is built is critical to Trudeau's plans, with a Canadian election expected next autumn.\n\nAlberta has felt the financial pressure, and an industry source said the provincial government last month solicited proposals from companies on ways to move crude faster by rail. The source said proposals included ideas such as buying rail cars and investing in loading terminals.\n\nIve never seen (the Alberta government) so active on this front, said the source, who asked not to be identified because the matter is politically sensitive. That is a shift.\n\nThe Alberta government did not comment. In a statement to Reuters on Thursday, a spokesman for its energy ministry declined to specify options under consideration.\n\n\"People have placed quite a lot of hope in that (Keystone) project, so it's a major setback,\" Saskatchewan Energy Minister Bronwyn Eyre said in an interview. Her province stands to lose C$500 million in annual royalties if the discount for Canadian crude remains steep, she said.\n\nMorris, in his ruling, ordered the government to issue a more thorough environmental analysis before the project can move forward. He also said the analysis failed to fully review the effects of the current oil price on the pipeline's viability and did not fully model potential oil spills and offer mitigations measures.\n\nThe ruling likely sets Keystone back by up to one year, said Dan Ripp, president of Bradley Woods Research.\n\nFormer U.S. President Barack Obama rejected Keystone XL in 2015 on environmental concerns.

It's all about the culture interview, one based purely on whether or not an applicant fits the company's values. Even if a candidate's resume is perfect, failing the culture interview will take a person out of the running for the job.\n\nGetting that culture fit is the only way to keep the \"wheels from falling off\" during extreme growth, Trout says.\n\nThe culture interview is conducted by someone totally separate from the candidate's application process. In fact, the interviewer won't even see the candidate's resume. About 20 staffers at Health-Ade are trained to do culture interviews including Trout, who makes time to do a handful each year.\n\nHealth-Ade does the culture test in the final stages of the interview process, when managers are really excited about a candidate and know the person has the right skill set, Trout says. \"They're not assessing [candidates] for their ability to do that job, they're assessing them for their culture fit,\" Trout says.\n\nIn the culture interview, each candidate answers between four to eight questions related to the company's values, which include grit, optimism, authenticity and leadership. \"They're soft values so objective measurements aren't possible,\" Trout tells CNBC Make It. \"We're looking for the interviewer or manager to use these as [guides].\"\n\nThe questions during Health-Ade's culture interview are phrased more conversationally than interview questions asked during their traditional interview.\n\nFor instance, instead of asking \"What is your biggest strength?\" applicants during the culture interview might be asked \"What is your ninja power?\" Trout wants candidates in the culture interview to be more candid and show their true personalities rather than give a cliched response.", "Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have long dominated the technology IPO world, with one of them winning the lead spot on almost all of the past decade's biggest offerings.

The strategy is to build relationships with start-ups as early as possible and outmaneuver Goldman and Morgan Stanley to become a tech company's go-to bank.\n\nIPOs are typically underwritten by a number of firms, with each finding investors to buy the shares and then splitting the fees paid by the company.

The following is a link to video of the interview on CNBC.com: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/11/09/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-pg-ceo-david-taylor.html.\n\nAll references must be sourced to CNBC.\n\nDAVID TAYLOR: It's a very significant move in the direction we have been moving. You know, two years ago at CAGNY, I think it was February '16, I talked about moving more in the big markets starting with the U.S. in an end-to-end format to make sure our businesses went all the way to the customer. The same time we talked about in some of the smaller markets having something called \"freedom within a framework,\" so it would be more agile in small markets. This takes it to the next big step. And at the same time it changes some other things about how we staff and manage talent to reinforce this choice, to make sure we're more agile, accountable, and able to win in both big markets and in smaller more volatile markets.\n\nSARA EISEN: So does this mean you're listening to your new board member, Nelson Peltz?\n\nTAYLOR: I listen to all my board members. And then we start with listening to the consumer. But we also, as we lead the organizational changem we did certainly consult with all 12 of our external board members. And we have a very active and engaged board. And they've been active and engaged. But certainly any good ideas we'll take. I don't care where they come. If it allows us to grow faster, that's a good thing.\n\nEISEN: Do you have any regrets about the way that the company approached that proxy fight, and fought so hard against him joining?\n\nTAYLOR: No, because I think it was important that we established what we believe was right. P&G is a company about winning over time and we're about doing it the right way. Our purpose, values and principles got everything we do so when one challenges in some areas some things that we didn't think made sense, we thought it made sense to stand up for what was right as we learned more and more and talked as often happens with dialogue we're able to find some common ground and we listen to investors we do believe you listen to your investors and your other stakeholders.\n\nEISEN: You did see the best sales growth in years in the last quarter and investors are trying to figure out with that tough macroeconomic environment just how sustainable it is.\n\nTAYLOR: Yeah to me that the best evidence I can give for sustainability is: look where we were two years ago, last year, and this year. And what you see is a consistent improvement in the number of brands growing, the number of countries that are growing, which says we're doing it a way that is sustainable. It's not by an aggressive promotion in a market or with a customer, it's by this superiority strategy that is really substantive. Better products that are meaningfully better. Not a little bit better so you can make a claim, but better so that if you use the product, the brand and go back to what you're used in before you notice the difference, so you come back. And there's many products here in many brands that really make a difference and if the consumer really loves it and he or she comes back, that's a sustainable approach. We will have to deal with and are dealing with to being in one of the more difficult foreign exchange environments for a U.S. domiciled company. We're dealing with difficulties in commodities because of you know oil prices and others over time -- they've come down recently -- but in general commodity costs are higher in transportation and warehousing. Especially in the U.S. costs are higher.\n\nEISEN: Do you think inflation and the broader economy is gonna be a problem?\n\nTAYLOR: -- There's not a lot of evidence that inflation has grown a lot in the US and it tends to be certain categories where input costs have gone up a good bit. And that's not all categories. And the other thing is over time we will find opportunities through productivity to either offset or to bring innovation where the consumer chooses to buy by the new brand or the new form or whatever delights the consumer more. We watch carefully if the value ratings go down and certainly an aggregate we'll see what happens with inflation. But certainly what we've seen in the US and in many countries, it hasn't gotten ahead of itself. There are certainly some of the more volatile countries where foreign exchange has changed significantly. And we have raised prices significantly, you are seeing some escalating inflation. Certainly places like Argentina in Turkey, two markets we have a meaningful business. That's a very different story than the U.S.\n\nEISEN: No the U.S. -- I mean the consumer environment has been strong. Spending has been strong. Do you see that continuing into next year?\n\nTAYLOR: Certainly. There's no evidence either unemployment or consumer confidence or any other the macro factors that would cause me to lose confidence of the U.S. being a great market to do business in. Right now it's one of the reasons why we're telling all of our category leaders we need to win in the U.S., which is why I take a lot of confidence on the sustainability of the strategy and that we're growing share -- the past one month, three months, six months and moving now to 12 months in the U.S. Getting it right in our biggest market is a strong statement on the sustainability of the action plan of the strategy.\n\nEISEN: But overall U.S. economy -- feds raising rates. Does that feel appropriate to you?\n\nTAYLOR: Well, they've rates certainly a number of times. But the absolute rates still aren't very high by any historical measure. Certainly we're concerned if it gets ahead of itself, that would be a problem. Anything that causes consumer confidence to drop significantly or starts to weigh heavily on the growth rate of the broader economy would concern me.\n\nEISEN: But you're not seeing that?\n\nTAYLOR: Not in a big way. No. Our categories generally -- the 10 categories we do business generally have been pretty stable in the U.S. They are slightly up this year not down so I'm not seeing evidence the categories of which we do business -- these kind of categories are slowing down. And in fact when we bring innovation and we do our job right, we can actually accelerate the growth of the category because the innovation often brings something that may be higher price but better value. And that's true of things like Olay Whips, it's true of Tide Pods, it's true of Discreet Boutique, it's true of Pampers Pure. So, many of these are products that give you either a new form or additional benefits that the consumer is willing to pay a little more for because they provide better value.\n\nEISEN: You think the markets giving you enough credit? And stock is still down this year and underperforming the broader S&P 500.\n\nTAYLOR: You probably know as much as I do, it's very hard to predict short-run what the stock will do and what the market will do. I believe when we consistently deliver top bottom in cash, we'll get appropriately rewarded.\n\nEISEN: And to be fair to Mr. Taylor, the stock actually has had a very good run since May it's up almost 30% and that's on a combination of this very good quarter that they recently announced and the fact that the overall market has turned more defensive, adding up to a pretty flat year, guys, because of the concerns about trade and the strong dollar and slower growth going into the year. But Procter & Gamble has outperformed the broader consumer staples business. And guys, today's moves what they're talking about it's all about supercharging that growth and staying more competitive in an environment where they can't control things, like the strong dollar in the cost inflation and the tariffs which are all impacting this global company gets 60% of its business overseas.\n\nCARL QUINTANILLA: Sara, one thing that they can control is where they put their ad dollars and we know they've made changes to their strategy, focusing on digital media. And they made some updates yesterday right?\n\nEISEN: Yeah, so they're gonna continue to put more money in digital media it's actually something David Taylor and I talked a little bit about. I said, \"Does that include Amazon?\" \"Yes.\" Increasing money toward Amazon, I asked about Facebook actually because he mentioned that was one of the places they see a lot of engagement and they are trying to reach a new millennial consumer a lot of these big brands are and I said, \"Do any of the privacy scandals worry you or make you reluctant to put money into Facebook for advertising?\" He said he watches it pretty closely but no they see they still see it as a place to reach a lot of consumers obviously, with more than 2 billion people on Facebook. Instagram he mentioned. Snapchat. Twitter. So they continue to move those ad dollars there. And yeah I think they're one of the biggest advertisers in the world so that so that clearly matters. And it's part of their whole repositioning of trying to get newer innovations to the consumer faster and to a younger consumer something they talked a lot about it their analyst day yesterday.\n\nMICHAEL SANTOLI: Yes and Sara, was there any sense of changes at all in the relationship between the big retailers? There's always been this kind of sense of a pendulum swinging back and forth where the power sits maybe at times with the supermarket chains, the big retailers, where they can kind of squeeze suppliers like P&G. Is there any change on that front or are they just sort of focused on making sure that their brands just sort of outperform against the competition?\n\nThey are focused on the relationship they have with the consumer. And that's a big shift for P&G. I mean part of the problem with a lot of these big companies and the way they were structured before is it was all about the relationship with other businesses and retailers and getting shelf space. But obviously consumers don't shop that way anymore, eCommerce is a huge part of the program. And they've missed out with Dollar Shave Club and Harry's coming up and taking a lot of market share because the consumer just wasn't shopping the way that they used to. And they've missed out on innovations and the way that they shop. So they're hoping by this structure where the CEO of all the business units are responsible for everything, including product innovations, distributions, bringing them to the market, how quickly, how they market that -- that that will correct some of that. So the focus really is on that direct-to-consumer relationship which is a big shift for P&G. But Mike you know Warren Buffett talks about this all the time retailers have a lot of power squeezing them on margins, on prices. Right now, what Procter and Gamble and Kimberly and all these companies have to do is they're trying to raise prices and pass on these cost increases. It hasn't really happened yet. So we'll see how the retailers and the consumers respond to that. It's going to be a big story in the second half of the year.\n\nFor more information contact:\n\nJennifer Dauble\n\nCNBC\n\nt: 201.735.4721\n\nm: 201.615.2787\n\ne: jennifer.dauble@nbcuni.com\n\nEmma Martin\n\nCNBC\n\nt: 201.735.4713\n\nm: 551.275.6221\n\ne: emma.martin@nbcuni.com", "President Donald Trump is telling people he wants to replace Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross by the end of the year, according to three people familiar with the matter who are close to the president.\n\nTrump favors Linda McMahon to replace Ross in the role, said these people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. He is also considering Ray Washburne, whom Trump appointed as president and CEO of Overseas Private Investment Corporation last year, according to one source.\n\nMcMahon, head of the Small Business Administration and former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, has told some of the president's closest advisors that she's likely to take the job if she's offered it, people with direct knowledge of the matter said.\n\nThese people also said that a final decision has not been made and Trump could always change his mind at the last minute. It is also not clear whether Trump would push out Ross. The president has often expressed displeasure about Cabinet members but has stopped short of making a personnel move. Yet, these developments come two days after Trump forced out Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a frequent target of the president's wrath.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders did not deny that McMahon has become the lead contender to replace Ross. \"No personnel announcements at this time,\" Sanders said.\n\nThe Small Business Administration didn't deny it, either. \"Administrator McMahon is proud to serve the President and is focused on advocating on behalf of America's 30 million small businesses,\" the SBA said in a statement to CNBC.\n\nSanders did not respond to follow up requests on whether Ross will leave the administration by the end of the year or whether Washburne is under consideration for the Commerce post.\n\nThe notion that Ross could be out soon received some pushback from elsewhere in the administration. \"There is no indication that Secretary Ross will be gone any time soon. He's posted significant wins for the president's trade agenda and that shows,\" said a senior administration official close to Ross.\n\nAnother official close to Ross noted that the president \"has never voiced any discontent\" about the Commerce secretary.", "In a new agreement between tech giants Amazon and Apple, shoppers will soon see a selection of the latest Apple products on Amazon.com, Amazon told CNBC in statement.\n\nThe agreement means the latest Apple products like the iPhone XR, XS and XS Max will be available on Amazon.\n\nAmazon and Apple have a history of tentatively approaching deals with one another, careful not to give the other an undue advantage. Until last year, the companies were in a standoff over the Apple TV. Apple wanted Amazon to sell the product on its site, and in turn, Amazon wanted Apple to add its Prime Video streaming app to the device. Amazon stopped selling the Apple TV in 2015, which CEO Jeff Bezos later explained was to avoid confusing customers who would assume Amazon's streaming service would come standard on a device they buy on Amazon.\n\nNow, you can find Apple TVs on Amazon, and the Amazon Prime Video app on Apple TVs.\n\nCurrently, many Apple products are only available on Amazon through third-party resellers and the prices and conditions vary widely. The new deal, which will take effect on Amazon sites in the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan and India in the next few weeks, will limit resellers of Apple and Beats products to those authorized by Apple. Independent sellers of Apple products will have their listings removed after Jan. 4, 2019, but they can apply for authorization through Apple.\n\nStill, shoppers won't find Apple's smart speaker, the HomePod, on Amazon. Amazon doesn't sell the Google Home speaker either, and has a history of blocking potentially competitive Google products from its site.\n\nIn a statement, an Amazon spokesperson said the company \"is constantly working to enhance the customer experience, and one of the ways we do this is by increasing selection of the products we know customers want. We look forward to expanding our assortment of Apple and Beats products globally.\"\n\nAn Apple spokesperson said in a statement, \"We're working with Amazon to improve the experience for Apple customers on their site and we look forward to those customers having another great way to buy iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac and more.\"", "Navarro, known for his hawkish economic views toward China, has encouraged President Trump's tough talk with Beijing throughout an escalating trade war between the two countries. Both economic powerhouses have imposed and threatened tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of each other's goods.\n\nTrump \"has had the courage and wisdom to stand up to the globalist elites, to stand up to the countries of the world that are engaging in unfair trade practices,\" the trade advisor added. \"Donald J.Trump has done an amazing job of addressing that issue and he didn't need the help of Wall Street. He didn't need the help of Goldman Sachs. And he doesn't need it now.\"\n\nGary Cohn, the former top national economic adviser, argued against imposing tariffs on China. Cohn was formerly the president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs.\n\nNavarro also disparaged \"unpaid foreign agents\" and their \"so-called diplomacy\" in an apparent critique of those who have advised the president to settle with Beijing. \"All they do is weaken this president and his negotiating position.

Please refresh the page if you do not see a player above at that time.]\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense James Mattis are slated to hold a joint press conference to discuss US-China relations with Yang Jiechi and Wei Fenghe at the State Department on Friday afternoon. This presser comes in light of growing trade tensions between the two countries.\n\nThe talks were supposed to be held in Beijing last month, but were postponed after the Trump administration announced new arms sales to Taiwan and two U.S. and Chinese vessels almost came close to colliding in the South China Sea.\n\nThese talks are a predecessor to a meeting scheduled to happen at the end of the month between President Donald Trump and China's president Xi Jinping in Argentina.\n\nAmong the growing trade dispute between the two countries, the two leaders are likely to discuss issues such as dealing with North Korea, and how to better serve their respective constituents. The U.S. is also planning to ask for China's help in controlling the distribution of fentanyl, a synthetic form of opioids which is causing a surge of drug-related deaths across the United States.\n\nFriday's meeting will be followed by a joint news conference.", "Forecasts of a more extended November cold snap across the U.S. sent natural gas prices to a near two-year high, as investors worry about rising demand at a time when supplies are at the lowest level to start the winter heating season in 15 years.\n\nNatural gas futures for December spiked more than 6 percent to $3.76 per mmbtu, the highest price since December, 2016.\n\n\"We added a lot of heating demand over the last week,\" said Jacob Meisel, chief weather analyst at Bespoke Weather Services. \"This morning, there are more risks that the cold is going to linger a bit longer through November, not at the same intensity but it's enough to scare a market that has low storage levels and already has strong physical prices.\"\n\nMeisel said colder than average weather is expected from the Midwest into parts of the Northeast and East Coast. \"It looks like around November 16 to 17 we finally see the cold move out, but now there's one more system that could keep cold weather on the East Coast. There's still disagreement on the long range,\" he said.\n\nSource: the Climate Prediction Center/Bespoke Weather\n\nWeekly government data Thursday showed the amount of natural gas in U.S. storage facilities rose by 65 billion cubic feet to 3.208 trillion cubic feet in the week ended Nov. 2, but that is still 15 percent below the year-ago level of 3.788 tcf, and 16 percent below the five-year average.\n\n\"I think we're looking at the potential for shortages towards the end of the season, depending on how the winter goes,\" said John Kilduff, partner with Again Capital. In recent years, the U.S. has started the heating season with record supplies that were largely depleted by the end of the season.\n\nKilduff said, however, the amount of gas in storage this year at the Nov. 1 start of the winter heating season is unusually low. The last time supplies were this low in the first week of November was in 2003, and that year natural gas prices hit $12 per mmbtu.\n\n\"Now we'were going into the winter 15 percent in the hole, and prices could double or triple from here,\" said Kilduff. He said gas prices could easily cross the psychological threshold of $4 per mmbtu for the first time in two years.\n\nDecember may offer a reprieve. Meisel said the weather outlook is still unclear, but as of now December is not expected to be that cold. \"Most seasonal forecasts, including my own, show periods of warm temperatures, especially in December,\" he said. \"The cold may come back in January and February, but I'm still pretty confident that risks in December are to the warmer side.\"\n\nAnalysts say one reason for the low gas supplies is the fact that the warm weather stretched longer into the fall, requiring extended air conditioning usage across the country. There was no gap between the hot weather and the arrival of cooler weather, which required heating systems to be turned on.\n\n\"It's all because of that weather,\" said Meisel. Production levels remain near record highs, and if the weather stays warmer, gas in storage could be increased, he said.\n\n\"This is the first winter in several years that we haven't started with a record amount of gas in storage,\" Kilduff said. He said the deficit is also due in part to the fact that the U.S.' natural gas bounty has led to exports, as both liquified natural gas and gas through pipelines.\n\nWATCH:Here's what drives the price of oil", "Laura Perryman expected her medical company, Stimwave Technologies, would have to wait several years for its painkilling device to win U.S. approval as a treatment for chronic migraines.\n\nShe now thinks it could be done in months, thanks to a new initiative by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to use medical device-based treatments, diagnostic tests and mobile medical apps to address the country's opioid crisis.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump declared a public health emergency over the abuse of heavy-duty painkillers like oxycodone and hydrocodone, he ordered all government agencies to take action in response to the death of 70,000 Americans last year from opioid overdoses.\n\nThe FDA told Reuters it has received over 200 submissions from companies seeking a speedy approval process for their devices. These range from Stimwave's Halo to painkilling products made by Abbott Laboratories and other industry heavyweights as an alternative to opioids.\n\n\"We're pleased by the robust interest in this innovation challenge and the acknowledgement from developers about the unique and important role medical devices, including digital health technologies like mobile medical apps, have the potential to play in tackling the opioid crisis,\" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said.\n\nPerryman's Halo devices, which look like angel hair pasta and are so small they can be injected into a nerve, took four years to get U.S. approval under other names for easing leg and back pain.\n\nShe hopes a spot on the FDA program will see Halo approved within a year as an alternative to opioids, which are currently used to treat an estimated 50 percent of patients who come to emergency rooms with migraines.\n\n\"This is kind of perfect for something like ours...since the device is shown to be safe already,\" said Perryman, who founded privately-held Stimwave in South Florida seven years ago.\n\nThe FDA has been increasingly reluctant to greenlight new opioids for market but earlier this month approved a potent opioid-based painkiller from AcelRx Pharmaceuticals placing tight restrictions on its distribution and use. In a rare move, Gottlieb made a public statement at the time, explaining the decision.\n\nThe regulator's push for alternatives to opioids has helped drive interest from venture capital funds and institutional investors this year in firms promising to develop alternatives, according to interviews with device companies, financial services firms and brokerage Cowen & Co.\n\nFor example, privately-held Virpax Pharmaceuticals, which makes an aerosol spray that delivers a non-opioid pain drug, said it had four or five banks interested in running its Series A investment round this summer versus just one in the past.\n\nStimulation\n\nAbbott, like rivals Boston Scientific and Nevro, makes neuromodulation implants which stimulate the nervous system to mask pain signals before they reach the brain.\n\nAbbott has submitted an entry for the competition in the hope it will slash waiting times, which often stretch several months just to get an initial meeting, according to Dr. Allen Burton, Abbott's medical director of neuromodulation.\n\n\"Devices that are part of this (program) will be streamlined... their meeting will go to the top of the pile,\" said Burton.\n\nWhile neuromodulation is only a small part of Abbott's large medical device business, the unit is seen as a growth engine for the company. Burton estimates between 10-to-20 percent of the growth Abbott has seen in its neuromodulation business could be tied to doctors prescribing its devices for pain after surgery or from injury to patients that are opioid averse.\n\nBoston Scientific did not apply for the contest, but the company is investing \"heavily\" in its neuromodulation unit, which was its fastest-growing at nearly 23 percent in the latest quarter, according to Maulik Nanavaty, senior vice president at the device maker.\n\n\"We continue to make external investments in early (neuromodulation) technology,\" he told Reuters.\n\nTo be sure, these devices are not seen as a silver bullet for opioid addiction. Nirad Jain, a partner at consulting firm Bain & Co, believes many of the solutions on the table are just tinkering at the edges of a problem that needs to be solved by doctors simply settling for fewer or less potent opioids.\n\nAddiction\n\nAcademics and charitable groups dealing with the social fallout of the crisis say the bulk of the rise in deaths stems from misuse of prescription painkillers. That has put the onus on regulators in September to issue new rules cracking down on prescribing by doctors.\n\n\"The goal is that these guidelines will provide evidence-based information on the proper number of opioid doses that should be dispensed,\" Gottlieb said in a statement at the time.\n\n\"Our goal is to help prevent patients from becoming addicted by decreasing unnecessary or inappropriate exposure to opioids.\"\n\nAlthough the FDA contest is limited to devices and app-based solutions for pain and addiction, the current regulatory climate is also conducive to companies developing opioid-alternative pharmaceuticals.\n\nDrugmakers including Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Teva Pharmaceutical have been packing their pipelines with potential solutions to the crisis and there are 120 non-opioid drugs under FDA review this year, up some 650 percent since 2013, according to business intelligence firm Informa.\n\nPrivately-held SPR Therapeutics told Reuters it has entered its \"temporary\" neuromodulation device in the contest. Similarly to Stimwave's, its product is implanted into the body but can be surgically removed after about two months. Josh Boggs, a senior executive at the company, expects to get quicker feedback from the FDA and shorter review times in the wake of the crisis.\n\nAfter years in the business, he believes the crisis has increased the agency's desire to collaborate with medical technology companies like his.\n\n\"I feel like (FDA) people are coming well prepared to meetings and are very engaged in it. It feels like an atmosphere that's conducive to finding a solution,\" he said.", "General Electric responded Friday to questions about the company's financial situation raised by J.P.

The company has \"substantial sources to de-lever,\" the person told CNBC, through the separation of health care and the sale of its transportation assets.\n\nThe J.P.

Tusa said GE's third-quarter results \"appear to go against the notion that there is 'lots of restructuring' going on here.\"\n\n\"While the stock is down ~70% from the peak of $30, this move still does not sufficiently reflect the fundamental facts, in our view,\" Tusa said.\n\nWATCH:Three experts on GE's future after firing CEO John Flannery", "Andreessen Horowitz led a $154 million round in corporate travel management company TripActions.

We have some must hold levels for the XHB,\" Gordon said Thursday on CNBC's \"Trading Nation.\" \"If you look at the entire rally that we've seen since 2016, to do some technicals this is the two-thirds retracement.\"\n\nA technical retracement refers to a pullback within an uptrend that gives back some of the gains already logged. A two-thirds retracement implies that at least 60 percent of the initial move has been erased. It is often seen as a bullish trend where the charts find support and then resume an upward move.\n\nGordon said the XHB ETF must hold above the support zone of roughly $31 to $34. If it breaks below this, new lows are highly likely, he said. The ETF also needs to hold its old lows of $25 to $26, added Gordon.\n\n\"We've begun to hold, we're showing life, but we must hold that zone right there or else those high interest rates could continue to crush housing.

In China \u2014 the world's second-largest economy \u2014 economic growth slowed to 6.5 percent in the third quarter, missing estimates. Meanwhile, euro zone GDP growth decelerated to 0.2 percent in the third quarter from 0.4 percent in the second quarter.\n\nOn top of that, continuous trade tensions between the U.S. and China have also depressed commodity prices. Washington and Beijing have exchanged tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other's goods this year, sparking fears that tighter trading conditions could slow down global growth.\n\n\"What's happening in the commodity markets has to do with trade,\" said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Exencial Wealth Advisors. He added, however, that he does not think the commodity complex's broad decline is signaling an economic contraction ahead.\n\nThe decline in commodities has been especially hard on emerging markets as most are net commodity exporters. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) \u2014 which tracks a broad basket of emerging market stocks \u2014 is down nearly 14 percent for 2018 through Thursday's close. The iShares ETFs that track Mexican and Chinese stocks are also down 13.6 percent and 11.2 percent, respectively.\n\nEmerging markets will need to recover for the global economy to recover, Sri-Kumar said, noting: \"EM now accounts for 60 percent of the global economy.\"\n\nBut Matt Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management, said the sharp losses in commodities could be a buying opportunity for investors as we get closer to the end of the current economic cycle.\n\n\"We're late into the cycle and usually value outperforms growth at these stages,\" Lloyd said. \"Commodities have been in a depressed market for some time and that has to do with the fact that we've had an anemic recovery from the global recession.\"\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Gina Francolla contributed to this report.\n\nWATCH:Why you shouldn't panic when stocks are getting slammed", "At least 400,000 votes were still uncounted as of Friday morning, according to The Associated Press.

The following is a link to video of the interview on CNBC.com: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/11/08/disney-ceo-comments-on-companys-performance.html.\n\nAll references must be sourced to CNBC.\n\nJULIA BOORSTIN: Thanks so much. And Bob Iger thanks so much for joining us today, on this big earnings beat for you, both on the top and bottom line. Tell us what is driving this \u2013 this upside surprise for the company?\n\nBOB IGER: Well, if you don't mind, before we get to earnings, it has been a very difficult day in our country and in particular in our backyard in Southern California where 12 innocent people lost their lives through a senseless act of gun violence, including a heroic member of law enforcement. And these were people that were neighbors and relatives and our hearts go out to all of those victims. It is a very \u2013 just a very very difficult morning here.\n\nBOORSTIN: Certainly a tough time in Southern California with this shooting. Now, moving onto your \u2013 to your results, big upside surprises, especially at the studio. What was driving that growth?\n\nIGER: Well the studio had another record year with just incredible success across the board. And obviously a great, very strong film slate. And so that really helped drive not only our earnings for the quarter but for the year. No studio has ever done as well as our studio did in fiscal 18.\n\nBOORSTIN: And tell me about the media networks division, particularly strong growth in broadcasting, but what's going on at ESPN? What are you seeing in terms of cord cutting and subscriber losses, and also the ratings trends?\n\nIGER: Well we are on a same war on the call just after this interview but ESPN had its best quarter in quite a while, in terms of sub losses. And what we're seeing there is continued erosion in terms of traditional subs but the growth in the digital MVPDs continued through, not only the year but the quarter. And so the sub losses were bated substantially.\n\nBOORSTIN: So does that mean you see a quarter either next quarter or in the future when you'll actually start seeing the growth because of these digital MVPDs?\n\nIGER: Well I \u2013 we are not going to speculate about the year ahead because it's just begun. So it is a just little early. But the signs -- the trends have been good for a while. And these were the best numbers we've seen in a long time.\n\nBOORSTIN: And then in terms of the theme parks, it sounds like particular strength in the U.S., you've been making some really big investments both internationally and here at your U.S. Parks. Do you see those investments paying off? And what are you seeing in terms of consumer trends? Does the consumer seem confident that they're spending more?\n\nIGER: Well I think the results at the parks and resorts are the result of a number of things. What we have managed to build over the years and the fact that we're leveraging the great IP at the company has certainly helped. We have incredible operational excellence at our parks, not just domestically but you know, across the world. And we've also implemented a bunch of new strategies when it comes to ticketing and pricing, one more recent in Florida, which didn't really have much of an effect this year because it just kicked in, but to make things simpler, to not only spend demand a bit and improve guest experience, make it easier as well to buy the tickets and also to increase yield. And on top of that we are seeing, particularly domestically, a very strong economy and that clearly has helped us.\n\nBOORSTIN: And it seems like --- do you have any sense of how it is impacting consumers or their outlook in terms of bookings for the -- the calendar fourth quarter?\n\nIGER: All signs look good right now, suggesting that our product is resonating, the people still want to our parks and the economy domestically is helping.\n\nBOORSTIN: Great. Now, tell us a little bit about your digital strategy. We're about a year out from your launch of the disney direct to consumer app. What more can you tell us? Do you have name? Any more details?\n\nIGER: We are announcing a name, probably in about 15 minutes.\n\nBOORSTIN: Are you going to tell us?\n\nIGER: No. I'm going to wait for the call. I want people to listen to our earnings call. You know, we announced a year ago that we were going to the direct to consumer business in a fairly big way not to take advantage of trends that we are seeing, but to start shifting our business to address a lot of disruption and transformation that we're seeing overall. And since that announcement, we acquired the majority stake in BAMtech, the technology platform necessary to launch these products. We launched ESPN plus which is doing extremely well, and achieved over a million paid subs fairly quickly and that growth is continued but we are not getting specific in terms of updating it. And then in the end of calendar 19, we'll launch a Disney direct service that will feature Disney Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and ultimately national geographic. And then of course through the acquisition of 21st Century Fox, we'll end up with a controlling stake in Hulu, or 60% of Hulu, and that will be a priority as well in terms of investment and growth in the -- basically direct to consumer digital media space.\n\nBOORSTIN: And in terms of the Disney direct to consumer app, what is your plan in terms of acquiring or investing in more original content to make sure you have enough to launch with a year from now?\n\nIGER: Well we're doing a few things. First of all we're weaning ourselves of third party licensing, which we've already started, so that the product appears on our service and not on third party services. We're investing substantially in original content, really against what will be all of those brands but we're making Star Wars series and Marvel series and certainly series and Pixar original movies as well. And then there will be thousands of hours of library products that will be television and movies. And then there will be a lot of programming that the core Disney fan we believe will really love. You know there are ardent fans all over the world and we have the opportunity to pull back the curtain a bit and show them things they've never seen before, including a great docuseries on Walt Disney Imagineering.\n\nBOORSTIN: And as you get closer to the launch of this product, do you cleaner, clearer, a better sense of how many people are the target audience? Like how big this addressable market is?\n\nIGER: Well the good news for us is, first of all there's a huge family audience to target. And that's with the Disney service will be -- and I almost gave the name away -- and then \u2013 I've been using the name awhile \u2013 and then we also know that we have core fans that are Disney fans and then there are marvel fans and Pixar fans and of course star wars fans and when the acquisition is complete there are people who love national geographic. So this will be very brand centric, and that's a good thing, not just in terms of obviously attracting subs because of the importance of those brands and the interest people have in them but it will also be a navigational tool so we look to build what I'll call a really really elegant experience for people. You'll have enough volume to obviously support price and to attract customers but it will also be a lot of quality, and quality under those brand umbrellas, and simplified navigation because of those brands.\n\nBOORSTIN: You mentioned Hulu, of which you'll own 60%. Are you going to pursue acquiring the 30% of Hulu that Comcast owns or the 10% that Time -- Warner Media owns?\n\nIGER: Well, it is premature really except to say that if Comcast is interested in divesting, or if Time Warner or AT&T Time Warner is interested in divesting, we certainly would be interested in buying their stake. But with 60%, which is what we will own, we'll have enough control to manage Hulu in a way that is consistent with -- the strategy of the company is deploying.\n\nBOORSTIN: But would the ability to acquire more of it change how much you invested in it, in terms of content?\n\nIGER: No, not necessarily. Our plan is to invest in all three services: the ESPN service, the Disney service, and the Hulu service, so that we achieve our goals in terms of not just going in to the direct consumer space but transforming the company by being in that space. That will require investment, and those investments will be made across those three brands. We started with ESPN and Disney. Hulu obviously has been investing in content. It is increasing that is being made and to use production entities of what will be the new company, particularly on the television side thanks to the fox assets and the talent that we are bringing in to help fuel Hulu's growth as well.\n\nBOORSTIN: You're nearing final approvals for your Fox acquisition. What can you tell us about the state of the integration and where things stand now?\n\nIGER: Well obviously, there is just so much we can do until we get final approval. We are very happy that we achieved that in the EU just this week and there are just a few markets left to go. And we are optimistic that we will get regulatory approval in those markets. At a time that's probably meaningfully ahead of what we anticipated back in June, we said it could take as much as 12 months. So we feel good about that. While we are waiting, there is a lot of planning that is done. We are able to create basically the outline of an organization and we announced that for both television and for the studio. But we can't run the business as one. And we can't really influence how the business is being run in the interim. So, it's kind of a waiting period right now. But during that period we can identify not only the opportunities but a lot of things we are planning to implement as soon as the deal is approved.\n\nBOORSTIN: One of the markets that has not yet been approved, the deal is china. Are you at all concerned that China could block the deal as part of retaliation over trade issues?\n\nIGER: No. We don't see any signs of that. We're optimistic about gaining approval in China. We hope it doesn't take too long. But no \u2013 we don't think politics is going to enter into this.\n\nBOORSTIN: You don't \u2013 and if you don't think politics is going to enter into that approval, we're just a couple days after the midterms, do you think that outcome of that election is going to impact your company at all?\n\nIGER: No. Not that I \u2013 no. Not that i'm aware. No.\n\nBOORSTIN: Not that you're aware. No. Another question about fox is you're now getting to spend more time with these assets, you've getting closer to this approval. And you are paying significantly more than you had originally agreed to pay, thanks to Comcast coming in as a rival bid there --\n\nIGER: Are you thanking to that? Or am I supposed to thank it?\n\nBOORSTIN: -- I should say a result of Comcast coming in as a rival bid, they are paying about 19 billion more. Do you a sense that you might have overpaid or do you feel \u2013 how do you feel about those assets?\n\nIGER: When we made the second deal that we made, which was in June, we said at the time that we felt very good about the price that we were paying. There were changes that occurred between the time that we made the deal in December and the time that we made the deal later in 2018. For instance tax legislation in the United States, as a for instance. And so we feel very good about the deal we made and we are looking forward to getting the approvals so we can operate as one company.\n\nBOORSTIN: And as part of that, there's a lot of changes to your studio. Tell us what to expect in terms of the studio going forward, you're going have a big chunk of the box office market share here in the U.S. How are you going to approach this to make sure that you're able to grow the studio without over saturating the market?\n\nIGER: Well, first of all we have both been in the market. And so I don't think we're \u2013 we're not looking to make more movies as a combined entity. We're thrilled at the assets and the people that we're bringing on the studio side \u2013 under Fox, and Fox 2000, and Fox Searchlight. Some of those movies are perfectly complimentary to the films that we make. They have been in the family business a bit but typically they are not. It is more adult oriented. Obviously searchlight makes a different kind of movie than the movies Disney is making. So we think that the films that those studios will make, have made and will make, are complimentary to the films that that we've made as a studio. So we think it fits in perfectly in that regard, in that there isn't that much overlap. The great thing too is with this comes not only talent but some incredible properties, starting with Avatar. And Jim Cameron's busy making not one but a few Avatar films that will be part of a Disney slate. And that's extremely exciting to us.\n\nBOORSTIN: Great. Well, we look forward to following the completion of the fox deal and also we will be tuning into your earnings call where you announce the name of the new Disney streaming service. That was a good tease there.\n\nIGER: Yeah, you almost caught me too.\n\nBOORSTIN: Thank you much for joining us. We'll let you get off to your call.

Economists polled by Refinitiv expected the preliminary read to come in at 98, slightly below an October print of 98.6.\n\n\"Consumer sentiment remained virtually unchanged in early November from its October reading,\" Richard Curtin, chief economist for the Surveys of Consumers, said in a statement. \"The stability of consumer sentiment at high levels acts to mask some important underlying shifts. Income expectations have improved and consumers anticipate continued robust growth in employment, but consumers also anticipate rising inflation and higher interest rates.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged at its meeting this week, but kept the door open for a rate hike in December. The central bank has already raised rates three times this year.\n\nCurtin added, however, that the virtually unchanged print kept the index on pace for its best year since 2000.\n\nThe latest look at consumer sentiment comes shortly after the U.S. midterm elections. Democrats took control of the House, while Republicans maintained a majority in the Senate. This result was largely expected by experts.\n\nCurtin noted that interviews leading up to Friday's release went through Wednesday night, \"there was only a one-day overlap after the mid-term election results were known by consumers.\"", "French authorities grounded a Ryanair plane at Bordeaux airport in a dispute over money they say the Irish airline owes.\n\nThe civil aviation authority said on Friday the carrier was obliged to pay back money it received as aid related to its activities at the regional airport of Angouleme between 2008 and 2009.\n\nThe aid was later deemed illegal by the European Commission. The plane, bound for London's Stansted airport, was grounded on Thursday.\n\n\"It is unfortunate that the state had to take such action, which led to the inevitable inconvenience of the 149 passengers on board,\" the aviation authority said.\n\nThe passengers eventually took off five hours late on another Ryanair aircraft. The authority did not specify the amount owed by Ryanair, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis has been a turbulent autumn for the airline. In October, the airline warned on full-year profits in the wake of a surge in the oil price and disruption caused by strikes. While it has reached deals with several unions, it faces resistance from staff in a number of countries.\n\nThe European Commission in October opened an investigation into whether Ryanair had benefited from illegal state aid at Germany's Frankfurt-Hahn airport, and this week Italy's antitrust agency opened a probe against Ryanair's new hand luggage policies.", "If you've ever ended up in tears over money, you're in good company. More than half of Americans admit they've cried because they didn't feel like they had enough, according to The Secret Financial Lives of Americans report by Nonfiction Research based on research and a survey of over 2,200 U.S. adults.\n\nIt is, after all, incredibly common to be just scraping by. Over 70 percent of U.S. adults say they'd find it difficult if their paycheck was delayed by a week, according to a survey of over 30,000 adults conducted by the American Payroll Association released in September, and a majority of Americans have less than $1,000 in savings.\n\nBut even many high-earners feel overwhelmed: 41 percent of those who make over $200,000 say they've broken down at some point because they felt like they were coming up short.\n\nThat stress is largely about your mindset, your lifestyle and how much money Americans generally think is \"enough,\" Saundra Davis, a financial coach and adjunct professor at Golden State University, tells CNBC Make It.\n\n\"There are only three things you can do if you are not happy with your financial situation: Make more, spend less or a combination of the two,\" Davis says. \"There is no other magic.\"\n\nThat said, a few simple adjustments can make you feel vastly better about your situation. Here's a three-step process you can follow to get you on the right track.", "Tesla has rolled out a special driving mode for its Model 3 Performance cars, specifically designed for high-performance driving and racing.\n\nThe change, which was unveiled Thursday, further establishes the Performance version of the Model 3 as a car meant to be driven on racetracks in competitions or by enthusiasts.\n\nCars typically have stability and traction control systems that keep the car from sliding under different conditions \u2014 such as when it makes a tight turn. But sometimes drivers want to be able to slide just a bit when they enter a turn \u2014 it can actually improve speed.\n\nTesla said it has replaced the typical driving system that keeps tires from skidding through turns with its own in-house \"Vehicle Dynamics Controller,\" which improves performance on a track when Track Mode is engaged. The car's driving mode can be changed with a switch of a button.\n\nThe electric car maker said the system uses inputs to allow the car to slide just as much as a driver wants in a turn. It bases its adjustments on the driver's behavior. If the car is not sliding enough, it will send power to the rear wheels. If it is sliding too much, it will send a power to the front wheels to straighten the vehicle out.\n\nHere is what it looks like:", "Though the cancellations were expected, Yelp failed to compensate with lower-than-expected gross customer adds. The company reported revenue of $241 million for the quarter, just shy of analyst projections of $245 million.\n\n\"We do not believe that there was any one single factor behind the new sales shortfall relative to our expectations. Instead, a number of smaller, compounding issues arose, including slower-than-expected sales head count growth, a change in advertising promotions, a technical issue in flowing leads to our reps and a lower success rate in contacting business decision-makers by our outbound sales calls,\" Chief Financial Officer Charles Baker said on the company's earnings call.\n\nIn light of lower-than-expected net adds and corresponding advertising revenue, Yelp slashed its full-year revenue guidance to a range of $938 million to $942 million, down from a previously stated range of $952 million to $967 million.\n\n\"One of the reasons we've expressed this year some caution about the transition to non-term contract is a recognition that the business is operating at a bit of a different clock speed today than it was before. And so one of the things we've learned is that the business is now more sensitive to the short-term productivity issues that probably were there in the past as well,\" CEO Jeremy Stoppelman said on the call.\n\nYelp also saw negative impacts resulting from changes in Google's search algorithm and sales representatives leaving the company in higher-than-normal numbers, executives said.\n\nAt least three Wall Street firms downgraded their ratings or lowered their price targets for the stock following the report.\n\n\"Unfortunately, to compete more effectively against digital platforms like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Snap (among others) for local ad budgets, Yelp may need to eventually make more dramatic changes to its self-service ad platform,\" Stifel analysts wrote in a note. \"We have seen how disruptive this type of change can be for a publicly traded company from watching Snap over the past several quarters; however, we think Yelp will face challenges in penetrating its paying advertiser [total addressable market] without this level of ad platform flexibility.\"\n\nStifel maintained its hold rating on the stock but lowered its price target to $34.", "President Donald Trump on Friday said he had not discussed special counsel Robert Mueller's with acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the man overseeing the inquiry, at least for now.\n\n\"I didn't speak to Matt Whitaker about it, I don't know Matt Whitaker,\" Trump said.\n\nWhitaker faces increasing scrutiny over his criticism of Mueller's investigation.\n\nWhitaker, a Trump ally, has accused Mueller of \"going too far,\" and once tweeted a message likening Mueller's prosecutors as a \"lynch mob.\"\n\nHe told CNN last year that he could envision a scenario where the person overseeing the probe \"reduces [Mueller's] budget so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\"\n\nPeople close to the president said it was Whitaker's public skepticism of the probe that drew Trump to take an interest in him, according to a report in The New York Times. The president appointed him on Wednesday, and has Whitaker's comments should not disqualify him.\n\n\"I think everybody looking at a permanent position in any department has done many shows,\" Trump said. \"Does that mean we can't hire anybody? We have to hire somebody that's in a shell? I don't think so.\"\n\nLegal experts have suggested that Whitaker's appointment as acting head of the Justice Department may be unlawful because he was not confirmed by the Senate to his most recent position in government. Before Wednesday, Whitaker served as chief of staff to Jeff Sessions. If Trump formally nominates him as attorney general, he would face Senate confirmation.\n\nTrump addressed that criticism Friday. He said that Whitaker was confirmed by the Senate following his 2004 appointment as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa by President George W. Bush.\n\nThat argument is not certain to pass constitutional muster.\n\nIn an op-ed co-written by President Barack Obama's acting solicitor general Neal Katyal and George Conway, a Republican attorney and husband of White House advisor Kellyanne Conway, the two disputed that the 2004 confirmation would permit his appointment.\n\n\"Mr. Trump can't cut and paste that old, lapsed confirmation to today,\" they wrote in The New York Times. \"For the president to install Mr. Whitaker as our chief law enforcement officer is to betray the entire structure of our charter document.\"\n\nAsked about the argument on Friday, Trump said that Conway was just trying to get \"publicity\" for himself.\n\n\"Why don't you ask Kellyanne that question, all right?\" he said.", "Daniel Loeb's hedge fund, Third Point, has trimmed the number of nominees it is making to the Campbell Soup board to five, sources tell CNBC.\n\nLoeb has been locked in a battle for control of the board and had been trying to replace all 12 of the directors.

We think that raises all boats,\" Taylor said. \"It'd be good for the global economy, good for our country, good for China for a productive and constructive resolution of this.\"\n\nStill, Taylor noted he has not yet seen an impact on consumer confidence.\n\nProcter & Gamble tends to manufacture close to its customer base, so its products intended for Chinese buyers are typically made in China and products for American buyers are mostly made in the United States.

P&G successfully obtained an exemption from paying steel tariffs on its Gillette and Venus brand razor blades after arguing against the levies in a letter to the U.S. Trade Representative.\n\n\"Higher costs from tariffs may also translate into higher prices, reduce P&G sales, and undermine American jobs in P&G U.S. operations,\" P&G lobbyist Selina Jackson wrote.\n\nStill, Taylor said the U.S. remains a primary focus for the company. He said that with innovation of its brands like Olay Whips cream-to-liquid moisturizer and Tide Pods detergent packets, he is confident Americans will continue to be willing to \"pay a little more because they provide better value.\"\n\nThat's even as it sees competition from cheaper, store-owned brands.\n\nMeantime, the sprawling consumer products company announced plans Thursday to simplify its operations.\n\nThe announcement came after activist investor Nelson Peltz joined the board in March following a vigorous proxy battle. Peltz had previously pushed for a simplified structure, saying it would improve accountability, agility and responsiveness to local needs.\n\nUnder the new business structure, the company will now have six sector business units organized by industry. Each business will have a unit \"CEO\" responsible for running all major decisions, like marketing, costs and supply chain.\n\n\"We did certainly consult with all 12 of our external board members. And we have a very active and engaged board...But certainly any good ideas we'll take. I don't care where they come,\" said Taylor.\n\nShares of P&G have jumped by more than 29 percent since hitting a 52-week low of $70.73 a share in May, giving it a market value of $227.6 billion. They closed on Thursday at $91.36 a share and opened Friday's session little changed.\n\nWATCH:Twelve US execs explain how Trump's trade war affects their bottom lines", "Former first lady Michelle Obama said she will \"never forgive\" President Donald Trump for spreading the so-called birther conspiracy theory with \"reckless innuendos\" that she said threatened her family's safety.\n\nMichelle Obama wrote the scathing critique of Trump \u2014 among the harshest words she's ever had for the president \u2014 in her forthcoming memoir, \"Becoming,\" according to a Friday report from The Washington Post, which received an advance copy. The book will be released Tuesday.\n\n\"The whole [birther] thing was crazy and mean-spirited, of course, its underlying bigotry and xenophobia hardly . But it was also dangerous, deliberately meant to stir up the wingnuts and kooks,\" Obama writes in the book, according to the Post. \"What if someone with an unstable mind loaded a gun and drove to Washington? What if that person went looking for our girls? Donald Trump, with his loud and reckless innuendos, was putting my family's safety at risk. And for this I'd never forgive him.\"\n\nWhen Trump was asked about Obama's book, he deflected and instead criticized his President Obama.\n\n\"I'll never forgive him for what he did to our United States military. I'll never forgive him for many other things,\" Trump told reporters outside the White House on Friday morning.\n\nThe conspiracy theory, which alleged that former President Barack Obama was born outside the U.S. and therefore ineligible to serve as president, first surfaced in 2008. In 2011, Trump started pushing the theory in television interviews as he floated the possibility of a presidential run.\n\n\"Why doesn't he show his birth certificate?\" Trump asked in March 2011 on daytime talk show \"The View.\"\n\nOn NBC's \"Today Show\" the same month, Trump said, \"I would like to have him show his birth certificate, and can I be honest with you, I hope he can. Because if he can't, if he can't, if he wasn't born in this country, which is a real possibility ... then he has pulled one of the great cons in the history of politics.\"\n\nTrump injected a religious element into the conspiracy, as well, suggesting that he hasn't shown his birth certificate because \"maybe it says he's a Muslim.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\n\nThe 426-page book is divided into three sections, the Post reports: Becoming Me, Becoming Us and Becoming More. The first discusses her upbringing in Chicago and explores issues of race, class and education. The second recounts her romance and relationship with Barack Obama, and the final section focuses on their lives in politics and under the public eye.\n\nWATCH:Trump's fight against 'fake news' has been a boon for media companies", "Lawmakers in the U.K. have questioned online \"fast fashion\" retailers about the impact of their production processes on workers and the environment.\n\nMary Creagh, chair of the U.K. government's Environmental Audit Committee, wrote to five online-only fashion retailers \u2014 including global firms Amazon and ASOS \u2014 to request information on areas including staff wages, the life-cycle of the garments sold, and steps being taken to reduce the environmental and social impact of their businesses.\n\nThe committee said it was considering policy recommendations on reducing the harm caused by cheap garment production, and would factor in the retailers' responses when delivering those recommendations to fellow lawmakers.\n\nPublished Friday, letters to Amazon and ASOS asked the retailers how they had ensured that all garment workers are paid the minimum wage; whether they educated suppliers on the cost of U.K. labour; and what recycled materials were used in their products.\n\nRetailers were given a deadline of November 15 to respond to the letters, with MPs suggesting they could ask certain companies to give evidence in parliament.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Creagh said evidence the committee had heard on October 30 from industry experts \"raised alarm bells about the fast growing online-only retail sector.\"\n\n\"Low quality \u00a35 ($6.51) dresses aimed at young people are said to be made by workers on illegally low wages and are discarded almost instantly, causing mountains of non-recycled waste to pile up,\" she said.\n\n\"We will be calling some of these online retailers in front of the Committee to answer questions, but in the meantime, my letters encourage them to face up to the social and environmental consequences of their business models. We want to know that they are fully compliant with employment law, that garments have a decent life-span, and that profit is not put before environmental damage.\"\n\nStella Claxton, senior lecturer in fashion management, marketing and communication at Nottingham Trent University, said the UK fashion industry in its current form was \"not that environmentally sustainable.\"\n\n\"Coupled with that we have a situation where chasing low prices has led to global supply chains looking for cheaper manufacturing, which is normally in developing countries,\" she said. \"Thinking about how consumption in Asia is going to rise in the next few years and how UK brands are looking to service those markets. Although it is a UK problem, it is a global problem as well.\"\n\nFurther evidence raised concern that suppliers in developing countries outsourced to sweatshops or were not paying workers the minimum wage. \"Sweatshop\" is a term for a workplace that has very poor, socially unacceptable working conditions.\n\nAmazon declined to comment on the issue. In an email to CNBC, an ASOS spokesperson said: \"ASOS is looking forward to co-operating with the committee.\"\n\nWATCH: Here's how Target is making a comeback", "Musk has been accused by some critics, including Tesla workers, of trying to do too much, and as a result, setting Tesla back rather than helping it to reach goals in the most effective manner.

Both sides have clashed over Italy's 2019 budget plans after the anti-establishment government promised to increase spending, challenging European fiscal rules.\n\nOn Friday, Italy's Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said Brussels' proposed deficit cuts would be \"suicide\" for the country's economy.

The court is due to hear its next arguments on Nov. 26.\n\nIf Ginsburg were unable to continue serving, Trump could replace her with a conservative, further shifting the court to the right. A potentially dominant 6-3 conservative majority would have major consequences for issues including abortion, the death penalty, voting rights, gay rights and religious liberty.\n\nAs the oldest justice, Ginsburg is closely watched for any signs of deteriorating health. She has bounced back from previous medical issues and has fallen twice before at her home, in 2012 and 2013, leading to rib injuries.

The stock rebounded from both of those sell-offs.\n\n\"There's actually a lot of rhyme and rhythm and repetition in this chart,\" said Gordon. \"We're seeing a very clean setback, kind of corrective within an uptrend.\"\n\nThe shift in board leadership has not changed one vocal Tesla bear's position.\n\n\"It's great that there's a new chairman in place for checks and balances, but the choice does not ease my concern about the instability of management,\" Mark Tepper, president of Strategic Wealth Partners, said on \"Trading Nation\" on Thursday. \"Robyn has been part of the Musk team for quite some time.

Even as Mattis tries to forge ties to contain crises, the Pentagon is ramping up activity that irritates the Chinese government.\n\nIn the 12 months ending on Sept. 30, for example, there were six so-called \"Freedom of Navigation\" operations in the South China Sea, compared with four in the same period of the previous year, a U.S. official told Reuters.\n\nSuch operations involve sending warships into international waters if they are claimed by other countries. China claims most of the South China Sea and has been militarizing islands there.\n\nThe six operations are equivalent to what the Navy did during the last two years of President Barack Obama's administration.\n\nThe Pentagon is also running warships through the Taiwan Strait with greater frequency and this year weighed sending an aircraft carrier through the narrow waterway, U.S. officials said. China claims Taiwan as its own and sees U.S overtures to self-ruled Taiwan as meddling in its internal affairs.\n\nSusan Thornton, who until July was the State Department's top Asia adviser, said the increased military activity is ratcheting up the risks.\n\n\"We are doing things that are frankly more aggressive, and the Chinese are pushing back harder than they ever have before,\" Thornton said. \"The risk of a mishap is growing.\"\n\nSchriver acknowledged that it was hard to predict how resilient U.S.-Chinese military ties would be in an actual crisis. \"I guess we won't know until there's a crisis, and it's tested,\" he said.", "J.P. Morgan cut its 12-month price target on General Electric to just $6 a share on Friday, the lowest on Wall Street.\n\n\"The outcome of GE results was worse than expected on almost all fronts,\" J.P. Morgan's Stephen Tusa said of the company's third-quarter earnings. \"While liquidity is certainly debatable, we believe this is not really about liquidity, it's about a deterioration in run rate fundamentals.\"\n\nGE reported profits on Oct. 30 that were sharply below Wall Street forecasts. Moreover, GE slashed its quarterly dividend to a penny a share in a dramatic move under new Chairman and CEO Larry Culp. While the dividend cut will free up cash for GE, the overall results gave J.P. Morgan confidence to cut to $6 a share \"based on clarity of the new numbers,\" Tusa said.\n\nShares of GE closed down 5.7 percent at $8.58 a share in Friday trading. The stock plunged as far as $8.15 a share earlier in the day, hitting the lowest level in nearly a decade.\n\n\"While the stock is down ~70% from the peak of $30, this move still does not sufficiently reflect the fundamental facts, in our view,\" Tusa said.\n\nGE expects to \"fall short of previously indicated guidance\" for full-year 2018 earnings, the company said when it announced the removal of John Flannery as CEO. But Culp did not provide an update to the forecast, which was previously expected $1 to $1.07 in full-year 2018 earnings. While GE's results for this year may be lower, Tusa expects the next two years of earnings will be even worse. His analysis estimates earnings of 35 cents a share in 2019 and 41 cents a share in 2020 \u2014 both of which are about half of Wall Street's expectations for GE's future profits.\n\n\"Out of the 8 reported segments, all of which were profitable even 2 years ago, 6 are now likely either at or below zero in 2020, with leverage actually up since that time,\" Tusa wrote in a note. \"In other words, we estimate material dilution from weak fundamentals and portfolio moves, with little in return, going against the notion from a year ago that the company could get $20 [billion] in value without diluting the run rate of earnings/FCF.\"\n\nFlannery's 13-month tenure saw him focus on turning the company around through trimming down to three core businesses. Culp focused on the company's ailing power business in his first month at GE's helm. Culp called for \"accountability across the organization to deliver better results\" during the latest earning report, emphasizing a continuing need to rebuild GE. But Tusa expressed skepticism about those rebuilding efforts, saying the company's results \"appear to go against the notion that there is 'lots of restructuring' going on here.\"\n\nThe restructuring is \"far from a 'kitchen sink'\" situation, where all the company's bad news comes out at once, Tusa said. Despite this view, Tusa said his current estimate \"is not the worst case scenario.\"\n\n\"While hard to imagine two years ago, and even harder to imagine a mere two months ago, the cuts to the model, and generous approach to 2020, using a sector average multiple, results in a stock value of $6,\" Tusa said.\n\nWATCH:Three experts on GE's future after firing CEO John Flannery", "Microsoft's cloud business has won a marquee deal from one of the country's best-known retailers.\n\nThe company said Friday it has signed a five-year deal with Gap to make Microsoft Azure the apparel company's primary cloud provider.

Gap will use the Power BI business-intelligence software as well.\n\nGap is looking to Azure for e-commerce operations, inventory and workforce systems, Bransten said. The size of the contract was not disclosed.\n\nCompanies are moving to the cloud to take advantage of a wider array of real-time services than they can get from traditional data centers and to more efficiently spend their capital, which is of particular concern to older slow-growth businesses.\n\nGap-branded stores generated less revenue than analysts expected in the company's fiscal second quarter, and the company's stock is down 18 percent this year.\n\n\"Retailers don't have endless budgets,\" said Bransten, who spent more than 15 years at Gap and then worked at Salesforce before joining Microsoft in September. \"So certainly moving to the cloud is an opportunity to take costs out and then improve the efficiency of their businesses.\"\n\nThe two companies have other existing connections.

EDF said that the IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, had coordinated a lender group that included 11 development finance institutions and four local, commercial banks.\n\n\n\nThe International Energy Agency has described hydropower as the \"largest source of renewable electricity in the world.\" It adds that hydropower generates roughly 16 percent of the planet's electricity from more than 1,200 gigawatts of installed capacity.\n\n\n\nThe project in Cameroon will involve the design, construction and operation of the facility for 35 years, EDF said. A 50-kilometer power transmission line will also be built. It will be owned and operated by the Nachtigal Hydro Power Company, which is 40 percent owned by EDF. The IFC and Republic of Cameroon own 30 percent each.\n\n\n\nEDF added that Nachtigal's expected power generation would meet 30 percent of Cameroon's electricity demand and amount to an annual power output of almost 3 terawatt hours.

We've seen our unemployment rate fall to 5 percent, the lowest level since 2012, with strong, increased employment across various brackets including seniors, women as well as younger people and we've also seen a budget that is on track to come back to balance in 2019, 2020, a year earlier than expected, and we have had triple A credit rating reaffirmed by Fitch and Standard and Poors most recently. But when we look abroad and having just been to the IMF World Bank G20 meeting in Bali, there are some global headwinds. We're seeing some trade tensions between China and the US, and Australia would be affected if that were to accelerate or to expand. We've also seen global debt levels increase since the time of the GFC and we've also seen the impact of the normalization of US monetary policy, particularly in the strengthening US dollar vis-a-vis some of the emerging economies. So we're watching the global growth story very closely. There's still a good story to tell but obviously what happens internationally impacts us here in Australia as well.\n\nMATT: Yeah we'll talk more about what's happening internationally in a moment but you mentioned the budgetary position, of course we saw the final outcomes of the budget released just a few weeks ago. You're of course gearing up to the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook that I understand will be released next month, the budget deficit at its lowest level in a decade. Will we see that surplus when you front everyone in a few weeks' time and reveal the mid-year budget update because we saw a big improvement from what was handed down in May to what was just revealed at the end of September.\n\nFRYDENBERG: You are right we've seen improvements on the receipt side as companies are doing well, jobs and employment is increasing and that is leading to more government revenue at the same time lower government payments since the number of working age Australians on welfare has fallen to its lowest level in 25 years, but we're still on track to bring the budget back to balance in 2019, 2020. Everything will be revealed in terms of the 18, 19 year, when we go forward with the next statement in through MYEFO but we are pleased with where the economy's at. We're not complacent. The economy doesn't run on autopilot and therefore will continue to put in place good economic reforms like lower taxes, infrastructure spending and targeted programs to get people into work.\n\nMATT: You just mentioned some of what's going to drive the economy. Infrastructure spending, lower taxes. But in terms of what you're going to be selling as we head into the election cycle, the election is going to be held some time potentially in the middle half of next year. What's going to be your economic story to tell the electorate and seek re-election because we know that under the former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his former Treasurer Scott Morrison, the big keystone economic policy of the government was this cut to corporate tax particularly for the big end of town, that was seen to give the economy a shot in the arm. But that's been scrapped now, so what's your major economic cornerstone that you're going to be selling to the electorate as you try and get re-elected sometime in 2019?\n\nFRYDENBERG: Well just to point out we actually have recently legislated through the Parliament, tax relief for 3.3 million Australian businesses incorporated and unincorporated businesses employing some 7 million workers-- that's very significant. Our message to the Australian people is that the economy is strong following significant reforms that the Coalition has put in place. We're a center right government and therefore we reduce spending and we reduce taxes and we increase employment. We have done all of the above with more than a million jobs being created over the last five years. So whether it's a budgetary record of bringing the budget back to balance a year earlier than expected, whether it's a record with the triple A credit rating agencies, having seen triple A credit rating reaffirmed, whether it's the job numbers or whether it's the other economic programs and tax relief that we've provided, we believe that is a good record to go into an election campaign. And of course there will be other announcements and policies that we'll make in due course and while we point out the strengths of a Coalition government's economic plan, we'll also point out the weaknesses in our political opponents, particularly the 200 billion dollar plan for higher taxes - higher taxes on your income, higher taxes on your business, higher taxes on your property, higher taxes on your savings and higher taxes on your electricity.\n\nSRI: Can I get back to the external environment, and can I ask you Mr. Frydenberg, what's your message to the G20 audience in Buenos Aires later on this month. What's your message to Mr. Trump, to Mr. Xi, and how confident are you of any kind of breakthrough concession or detente in this trade conflict.\n\nFRYDENBERG: Well, as you know, the tit-for-tat tariffs that we've seen extended by both the US and China has only been affecting about 2 percent of world trade. So we would ask that cool heads prevail here, and that that is not expanded. And while we understand some of the legitimate concerns that the United States has, we think it's in the global economies' interests, certainly in Australia's economic interests for a multilateral rules based international trading system to be maintained. We believe that the WTO is the place where disputes should be resolved, bearing in mind that some countries do have concerns with some of the current WTO processes but we would just say to all countries, big and small, through the G20 and beyond, that an international rules based trading system has supported growth, has supported jobs and is the way to go into the future.\n\nMATT: How is Australia's relationship with China? I know the Foreign Minister's been there this week but earlier on in the week you of course announced that you'd be blocking that CKI bid for APA group saying that it was contrary to the national interest but not discriminatory. Are you expecting any kind of backlash from China, who likes to invest in Australia, and of course this is not the first time a significant deal like this has been blocked by the Australian government?\n\nFRYDENBERG: Well as you know, Australia is a capital importing country. We are a major trading country and China is our number one trade partner. So we continue to welcome Chinese investment and we continue to welcome foreign investment and the preliminary view that I have made is not about a particular company or a particular country, it's making a judgment based on advice that I've taken into account from the Foreign Investment Review Board, from our critical infrastructure committee about what the implications would be for Australia. We just see a concentration of foreign ownership by a sole company in such a key set of assets as in the gas transmission sector in Australia. APA is a unique company with more than 50 percent of the gas transmission business in Australia. More than 15,000 pipelines supplying gas and electricity into key markets. And I've made my preliminary view known and will make a final decision in the next couple of weeks.\n\nMATT: We await that decision. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, thank you very much for joining us this morning with your insights on everything from Australia to the world.\n\nEND\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nClarence Chen\n\nCommunications Manager APAC, CNBC International\n\nD: +65 6326 1123\n\nM: +65 9852 8630\n\nclarence.chen@cnbc.com\n\nAbout CNBC\n\nCNBC is the leading global broadcaster of live business and financial news and information, reporting directly from the major financial markets around the globe with regional headquarters Singapore, London and New York.

The interview was first broadcast on CNBC's Squawk Box Asia on 9 November 2018.\n\nAll references must be sourced to a \"CNBC Interview'.\n\nInterviewed by CNBC's Arjun Kharpal\n\nArjun: Daniel you joined Alibaba back in 2007. When you thought about what e-commerce would become all these years, when you look at 2018 now, has your expectations been met or have you been surprised?\n\nZhang: I joined Alibaba in 2007. I thought e-commerce would have a bright future. That was the key reason why I joined Alibaba - because I was then an online shopper already, and I thought more and more people would enjoy this, and especially young people, and with the penetration of internet, we will have more online shoppers. So that's why - that's a starting point, I joined Alibaba. But I think 11 years later, when we look back, I would say how e-commerce changed the life of the consumers - the impact is even bigger than what I expected, and this is not only about the shopping, it's about the whole lifestyle. And today, many millennials are living on the internet and they don't go to the brick and mortars. They don't go to the shopping malls but they live online. And I think if you look at the people even younger, I mean teenagers, internet to them is more like water, electricity; when they were born, this is there. So I think over time people will rely more on the life of the internet.\n\nArjun: You're the architect of the double 11 shopping festival. Many people also know that as singles' day. When you came up with the idea 10 years ago, what was your thought? How did you get prompted to think of starting this shopping festival?\n\nZhang: Well actually this is a very occasional case because at that time we just started our new business - b2c Taobao mall business, which is today's Tmall. And at the time nobody knew us actually. We wanted people to remember us, and that's the starting point of when we thought of, 'let's do something to make people remember us', and then we found the day, 'let's do a promotion on November 11' - and we didn't even realize this is a holiday and this is the holiday in the western society, because in China there is no November 11. But when we did this, we thought, 'Ok, we have a very good slogan, and if people are still single on the day, if people feel lonely, then please come to us for some shopping and just get some fun from this shopping'.\n\nArjun: It's interesting to look back at that first one in 2009 and actually the kind of sales that raked in 7.8 million dollars in Gross Merchandising Value (GMV). If you look at that compared to 2017's singles' day where it was over 25 billion dollars, that seems like such a huge and very quick rise in the popularity of that event. In that first one you had 10 years ago, what were your expectations? Did you think that it would take off the way it has?\n\nZhang: Well actually - I never expected that we could actually transform this day into a commercial day, a consumer day for the whole society. I think today, when you look at the scale, it's more like all the people enjoy the shopping on the same day and all the merchants, they participate and share their best products on that day. And I think obviously this, today, is more like a phenomenon.\n\nArjun: So what's changed? What other things have changed from your first single day to now, except the fact that more people are being moved in and more money is being spent with them?\n\nZhang: The biggest change is how business people look at the power of internet. On day 1, people just thought that this is a new channel to sell more products. But today, most of the businesses view digital technology and the internet as infrastructure to transform their existing business and to go to a new market to serve the new customers\n\nArjun: In a recent speech you gave a pledge that this would be the largest single day ever. What did you mean by that?\n\nZhang: Well it means a lot. And in terms of the level of engagement of the customers in terms of the participants to be involved in this singles' day - I think this will mean a lot to both consumers as well as the business people.\n\nArjun: Does that mean you're confident you could potentially break that record of GMV you guys set last year?\n\nZhang: Well, GMV is the outcome of the day. I think most important is what we can offer to our customers together and what we can achieve in terms of business disruption and business innovation.\n\nArjun: It's the tenth anniversary in 2018. When you look 10 years down the line, what does single's day look like to you? What is the future of this event?\n\nZhang: Singles' day needs to be innovative as we always did in the past 10 years. I think if you look ten years from now, I would say that the format of the day and the way we do this will totally change.\n\nArjun: You have spoken about new retail a lot over the past couple of years. There are a lot of buzz words around it - online, offline - and you are investing in things like logistics networks, cainiao, and of course, cloud computing. What does new retail mean to the people watching this show? What does new retail mean to the company?\n\nZhang: When we talk about new retail, we strongly believe that online commercial world and offline brick & mortars are not separate worlds. And if you look at the customer base today, everyone is living in the internet. Everybody is an internet user. So you have the same customer base, you must have the same commercial world. It's all about how to integrate online and offline to transform to a whole digitalized commercial world.\n\nArjun: And how do you do that? What are the steps you're taking to do that?\n\nZhang: Well we have made a lot of efforts in terms of digitalising the existing brick & mortars in terms of creating new retail formats like Hema to meet the growing demand of the customers in, for example, in the fresh food categories.\n\nArjun: Hema's a very interesting example of a futuristic grocery store, almost. What learnings have you had from this so far? What are the trends you're seeing of how consumers have reacted to this kind of experience that you putting out there? And do you see now that a store like hema and the experience that it brings really is what the future of retail looks like?\n\nZhang: Well actually Hema is one of the new retail formats. The reason why we created this is because when we look at the format of the traditional e-commerce, we don't think it meets the demands of the people in the food categories, especially fresh foods. So that's why we were thinking about, can we create a new format, which people can enjoy instore - the fresh foods - but also they can order from online and deliver from stores. So I think when we look at the pinpoints of the customers we can still find a lot more. But this means to us the new opportunities, and we can definitely create a new format to address these pinpoints and create new business.\n\nArjun: And another new format that has become very popular, of course, is on-demand delivery of food as well. You recently struck a big deal with Starbucks. What was the driving force behind that deal?\n\nZhang: Well actually we have made a strategic partnership with Starbucks, and we work together to integrate their membership program between Alibaba and Starbucks. We help them to build the intelligence stores online in Alibaba eco-system. Also, with the support of our logistic infrastructure, we are now helping them to deliver coffee to home. And people can order coffee online, and expand their coffee space into fullest of coffee space, of Starbucks.\n\nArjun: Sometimes people look on-demand delivery and wonder if it has a long-term future, if it is sustainable business model. From what you've seen so far, do you think that these on-demand deliveries, the way you carry it out, is a sustainable business model going forward?\n\nZhang: Well on-demand delivery, I think, is an infrastructure - and not only for the food delivery business. This is also the infrastructure for future retail. And in terms of food delivery, I think, today more and more young people need these services, and they either don't have time to cook or they don't cook, and so people need these food delivery. But when we look at this on-demand delivery network, this also can serve many other categories' products. For example, people can order from some pharmacies at night if they catch a cold. So I think this could be an infrastructure for the future integrated digital business.\n\nArjun: Alipay is another important part of your strategy - run by ant financial, one of your affiliates. Why do you see the whole payments and financial technology piece of the puzzle as an important part of the strategy?\n\nZhang: Well payment is very very important infra for Alibaba's ecosystem, and with this digital payment platform, people can not only can enjoy the easy payment, but business people can also leverage this digital payment to serve the customer better and know more about customer behaviour, which will create huge value for their future business.\n\nArjun: While we're speaking about Ant Financial, I have to ask you for our viewers watching as well. We've been hearing a lot about the future of this company. It's a huge company here in China now and it's expanding globally as well. We have heard a lot of talk about potential initial public offering. Do you have any more clarity of when Ant Financial might go public?\n\nZhang: Well we don't have the agenda to go public. I think we still focus on how to create the value for the customers, and especially in the new technology.\n\nArjun: Many people call Alibaba an e-commerce giant, but you're much more than that. There's a lot of investment going on in technology. A big focus in your 2017 letter to shareholders last year, you said data is the new fuel. What kind of role - how do you use data at Alibaba across the business?\n\nZhang: Well we started from e-commerce, but today we have already transformed from an ecommerce company, to a data company. The way we create the data is from real business cases - for example, Taobao, Tmall, in food delivery - all these businesses are not only separate businesses to us, but also cases to create data. What we do is to first create the data, mine the data, and get the value from the data - and refuel back into business cases to make them even better. So I think this is a positive cycle, to make data useful, and to make data the core of our future digital business.\n\nArjun: Another interesting part of the business I've seen in action as well is cainiao - last year on singles' day, over 800 million parcels they dealt with. You said that there could be even more this year. How are you making it more efficient at Alibaba, to deal with the growing number of packages people are ordering, and making sure that they're able to get to the customers on time and in the quickest way possible?\n\nZhang: If you look at the delivery industry in China, I think that today it's about 130 million packages a day, and we expect this to continue to grow. I think the delivery experience is a very important part of the shopping experience. So that's why we are taking a partnership approach. We worked with many delivery companies to make sure that we can help them to optimize the end-to-end experience. And I think we can still do a lot more to help them not only to digitalise and improve the customer experience, but also help them to optimize their operations to get more efficiency from their network operation. If you look at the relationship between Alibaba and these delivery companies in China, it's a very real reflection of the partnership and the eco-system, because we love each other, and we grow together, and we serve our mutual customers.\n\nArjun: And artificial intelligence is another buzzword in the technology world at this moment. It's another area that you are investing in - there was an announcement earlier this year that Alibaba is developing some AI chips as well. It could be seen as a strange area for Alibaba to be developing and designing chips. What's the thinking behind this?\n\nZhang: A chip is the core of computing power. If you want to apply AI in the business, it's not only about the algorithm, but all about computing power. Can you get better computing power with more efficient costs? That's why we think we have to spend time on chips, and we have to develop chips for AI, and for various types of computing business cases.\n\nArjun: This of course links to your cloud computing strategy as well, which accounts for around 6% of the revenue at this moment. How important is this business for you going forward - as it grows at a really fast pace at the moment?\n\nZhang: Cloud computing is our long-term strategy. We strongly believe that every business in the future will be powered by cloud. We are very happy to build this cloud infrastructure in the new digital era and support all the businesses going digital.\n\nArjun: Do you see it in the future being a very significant part of the business?\n\nZhang: Yes sure, I think cloud will be the main business of Alibaba in the future.\n\nArjun: Another interesting trend we've seen in the technology world is the rise of these voices assistants. You've of course debuted Tmall genie. Well how does this fit into your version of what new retail looks like, because many people have said the future, or a big part of the future, will be the way we interact with our services through voice and our devices through voice. Is that a strategy you think is viable in the long term?\n\nZhang: Well we believe that voice is the next entry point of internet so if you look at the history of internet then we have the p.c. times and people get into the internet by click, right? And then they have the mobile internet people go to internet by scrolling the screen. And now it comes to the voice age, so people can go to the virtual world via voice. So that's why we started work on our Tmall genie. We strongly believe it could be an entry point in the living room when people want to go to the virtual world. And this also helps people to not only enjoy the services by the voice, but also to monitor all the equipment and the facilities in the home.\n\nArjun: So do you believe there'll be a big part of the shopping experience in the future for Alibaba customers?\n\nZhang: Well shopping is definitely one of the services we will offer in this voice system.\n\nArjun: I want to just move on to a big topic at the moment and that's of course the announcement by Jack Ma to step down as Chairman and you to take up that role. I want to learn a little bit more about your relationship with Jack and how this came about. When was the first time you met Jack. And what were your impressions of him?\n\nZhang: I met him right before I joined Alibaba - I met him and he invited me to join, so I came. I think that jack is a very visionary guy, and he thinks for long term, and he cares about people. We have worked very closely together in the past eleven years. In terms of characteristics, we are very complementary to each other. He flew a lot in the past years - he spent a lot of his time in the air - but I spent most of the time in the campus, and with the day to day operations. I think he's given me a lot of ideas out of the box. And I think these ideas - many ideas, maybe - you will be surprised to hear them for the first time. But if you think again you will find some real opportunities there. And they will work well for you to think more. So I think this is more like a share of the ideas, share of the energies, but I'm very happy to work with him in the past few years.\n\nArjun: You've worked with him for many years now. How do you meet up, how do you talk to each other, how do you inspire each other with ideas to help take the business forward?\n\nZhang: Well he has a lot of ideas. So as he's always said - and this is also my discipline, which is, when I hear his ideas for the first time I will listen. I will take the ideas and I will think about them for a while. But if he repeated his ideas once, then once again, at least three times - then I would take it very seriously. I think of them as his very serious ideas.\n\nArjun: So he has to say it three times and then you know it's a serious idea?\n\nZhang: You have to think of this seriously. Because if he repeats three times then you have to treat it seriously as well, right?\n\nArjun: Now, I understand you often had meetings over tea with Jack and you obviously worked together. What was one of your most memorable meetings with him?\n\nZhang: Well it's actually more like a catch-up right? It's a sort of catch-up, and you just share what you think. Some things are relevant to the business, and some things are not that relevant - and it's about people, about your experiences. So it's more like brothers that haven't seen each other for some time, so you catch up for coffee and tea. That's it.\n\nArjun: So you weren't always talking about the company and the strategy. Sometimes there were other things as well.\n\nZhang: Well you know this. We cannot change strategy once a month. The strategy is very clear. It's all about the sharing of the experience and the sharing of the ideas.\n\nArjun: You said you two were complementary and have complementary styles. There must have been times though when you had some disagreements. Were there any that spring to mind where you both disagreed on something?\n\nZhang: I think if you have some different opinions, you have to voice out right? You have to let him know that this is your view. But I think the most important thing is that you have to express this in a very clear way. Maybe we will argue, but actually I know that he hears what i say, and maybe he still insists - you know that he is very confident about his ideas, and he will insist on his ideas - but he will also listen and he will think, and maybe he will change some days later.\n\nArjun: How did you find out that you would be the next chairman? And how did that make you feel?\n\nZhang: He told me that.\n\nArjun: When was that?\n\nZhang: Well more than half a year ago, he said it to me. But I know that he planned this for a long time, as he said. And this is not easy. Because we want to be a company for 102 years - and if that is the case, you have to think about the future, about the succession plan.\n\nArjun: Can you tell me what he said to you when he told you that you'd be the next chairman?\n\nZhang: Well actually I cannot remember clearly what we talked about. And he tried to convince me to accept this, and we had several conversations. But I understand why he decided this. It's all about the future of Alibaba.\n\nArjun: You know, he's praised what you've done, and you've achieved lots for the company - very successful things. But of course at the same time there were lots of questions that were written in the media about whether you were up to the job. Did that add a bit of pressure to the role?\n\nZhang: You know I have a finance background and when I joined Alibaba, my first job was the CFO of Taobao. I never imagined that I will take on the business role, and I never imagined that I will be the CEO of the company. So I'll try my best to do the jobs and to lead the company in the next journey, and forget about the pressure. And that's what I always did. And if you look back on what I did in Alibaba, in Tmall, in this mobile transition, in new retail - I think, try everything you can for the best results. And of course you need a little bit of luck.\n\nArjun: Of course you are thinking long term about the company. 102 years is a key number, you've been talking about these spanned three decades. But is there anything you might do differently when you become chairman? When it comes to the strategy or the culture of the company?\n\nZhang: Well as I said, I am a very logical person. I do think about the big picture and to be the chairman of the company in the future, I think I need to spend more time on the future, on the long term goals of the company rather than just the three to five years. As what Jack did as a chairman, he always think about what will happen in ten, twenty years. So, think longer but start from now. It's very important and I think this is what I will change in terms of role and in terms of the working style.\n\nArjun: Under your tenure as CEO, while you've been at the company, you've been really pushing the internationalization of the business. Lazada, of course, has become a key part of the strategy in Southeast Asia. So how do you expect alibaba's presence on the international sphere to grow as you go forward? Is that is that an area of the business that you will be putting a lot more emphasis on?\n\nZhang: Well, we have a very long term goal about globalization and we want to serve two billion people over the world by 2036. We are very serious about this goal. Globalization, it is a long-term job but we have to start from now and the Southeast Asia is our first pick. But we do realize that we still need a China feature and to keep one leg in China. For example, to help imports to China and to help business partners to enjoy the largest consumer market in the world and help the Chinese people to sell out of China. So, cross-border is still very important. But, over time, we will try to explore opportunity in certain local markets. Southeast Asia, obviously, is a very promising one and close to china enough. It has a big population, 600 million population in six countries, and the mobile, young and retail landscape is very similar to China eight to ten years ago.\n\nArjun: And when you say you look to certain local countries would that mean with some sort of perhaps Alibaba product in those markets? Similar to how Lazada serves Southeast Asia?\n\nZhang: Well, we strongly believe that the consumption is very relevant to local culture and local lifestyle. So when we think about local businesses, we do need to help the local people grow the business and to build a business. So that's what we think and Alibaba is very happy to share our technology, our knowhow, experience to them to help them to win in the local market.\n\nArjun: And you mentioned globalization as well, which has become a very key topic but of course it's a difficult time in the world right now. I think Jack mentioned in his recent shareholder letter that the global economy is in a state of turmoil. He mentioned a few reasons, stock markets and manufacturing consumer trends as well as the difficult trading environment, which continues to persist. He said that the trade environment at the moment is increasing the risk of instability. Does this keep you awake at night? And is it something that is a big risk to Alibaba's business?\n\nZhang: I would say nobody likes trade war and nobody likes the uncertainty of the economic condition. But we always try to find opportunities in a tough time. If people have some pain points that means there are some opportunities. How to help people, for example, in the tough times to get more business, not only in China but also in the global markets? This is one of the examples we can explore, one of the opportunities. So I think for Alibaba, we always think about our mission which is to make it easy to do business anywhere. I think this is more relevant today in this condition.\n\nArjun: Are you doing anything in particular or different to help navigate the company through the difficult macroeconomic environment at the moment?\n\nZhang: Well, I would say if you look our business, we still have very strong business growth and our financials are very strong. We always say that we work for today, we invest for tomorrow and we incubate for future. I think this is a good time for us to incubate for the future and to create a new business for Alibaba's next journey.\n\nArjun: What does the future of retail look like?\n\nZhang: Well, I think future retail is not about e-commerce or brick and mortars, it is about the digitalized commerce or not. So the whole commercial world, the whole retail world should be one world. Online and offline brick mortar should be a highly integrated operation and serving one customer base. They operate one product segment. So it should be data driven retail operation, online and offline together.\n\nArjun: Daniel, the economy in China has not always been stable, of course, that is true anywhere in the world. But you've managed to increase sales on double 11 as well as just revenues generally for the business over the past few years. They continue to grow at a very rapid pace. How did you managed to do that even when the environment hasn't been as easy as you'd like it?\n\nZhang: Well, when we started November 11th ten years ago, it was 2009. And in this time, ten years ago, generally I think the economy was going up, and November 11 is more like a real reflection of the consumption growth and the growth of the digital business. And today I think more and more people join this shopping day, I think for customers they want more shopping but for business people, they are not only thinking about sales on that day. They are thinking more about customer engagement and acquisition of new customers and how to innovate new products and deliver this to their existing customers. So, it's more like a day to reflect their growing power, their business power. So, I call this olympics for all these business people. So, I'm sure if we work together, if we continue to innovate, we can create more great days for our mutual customers.\n\nArjun: And are you confident that the consumer market in China will stay strong over the next few years? There's been a few concerns raised by economists about the health of the consumer market in china. Are you confident that those still remain strong and good for the business?\n\nZhang: Well we do see the up and down of consumptions by categories. I think overall speaking, I think Chinese people, especially young people, they are growing up in a new era and they like to spend and they want a better lifestyle. So I think we want to continue to serve them in a better way.\n\nArjun: Daniel in your 2017 letter to shareholders, you said data is the new fuel. Alibaba is not just an e-commerce company now like many think, it's also a very key technology player as well. So what role does data play at the company?\n\nZhang: Well, Alibaba already transformed from an e-commerce company to a data company to a digital economy. What we experience is that we create a lot of data from real business cases, like Taobao, Tmall, our food delivery businesses, ele.me, so on and so forth. We tried to utilize the data and create value from the data and feedback to these businesses to help participants make better business growth. So, we are in the process of building, in the digital area, an operating system. Alibaba's operating system to enable our business partners to transform in this digital era. And I think in the future, all business people need this data engine and a data driven operating system to do digital business.\n\nEND\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nClarence Chen\n\nCommunications Manager APAC, CNBC International\n\nD: +65 6326 1123\n\nM: +65 9852 8630\n\nclarence.chen@cnbc.com\n\nAbout CNBC\n\nCNBC is the leading global broadcaster of live business and financial news and information, reporting directly from the major financial markets around the globe with regional headquarters Singapore, London and New York.

The interview will play out in CNBC's latest episode of Managing Asia on 9 November 2018, 5.30PM SG/HK (in APAC) and 11.00PM BST time (in EMEA). If you choose to use anything, please attribute to CNBC and Christine Tan.\n\nBILLIE JEAN KING, Founder, WTA\n\nChristine Tan: Everyone is talking about Shenzhen and what they're doing to bring WTA finals to China. They're throwing in a brand new tennis arena for you, they're giving you 14 million dollars in prize money, Are you excited the WTA final is going to be in China for the next 10 years?\n\nBillie Jean King: I'm very excited that we're in Asia and Asia-Pacific here with Singapore, but I think it's just amazing what has evolved. It's interesting because even from the day we started the WTA back in 1973, actually 1970 with the Original 9 and the birth of professional women's tennis, one of our dreams was to be global. And we knew Asia would be a huge part of that in the future, because Asia has such potential: potential from a player point of view, a business point of view, audience point of view, I mean, I just see it's unlimited, the possibilities. And next year, moving to China and Shenzhen, having US$14 million dollars and of course, the winner will get a little over US$4 million. I was thinking back in the amateur days when I made $14 a day and I'm so glad we got pro tennis...\n\nChristine Tan: You've come a long way.\n\nBillie Jean King: We have. It's too bad the older players aren't getting a percentage of the gross or something. That would have been great. No, I just think it's amazing what's happened. I think Li Na helped a lot with the popularity when she won the French, being the first Asian ever to win a major and she's been very good on the WTA tour as well.\n\n\n\nChristine Tan: Do you think the next big tennis champion; the next big tennis legend is going to come from China?\n\nBillie Jean King: Well, you don't know right away whether it will come from China, we definitely will have more great champions from China but it takes about ten years to make a champion at least. We do have the Chan sisters, we do have players\u2026 but you have to let it mature because it takes at least ten years to be a champion. So what's going to happen, because this is a 10 year contract, I imagine near the last few years of having the tournament there, you'll start to see a lot more Chinese women playing and also you're going to have a lot of new fan base which is really exciting. Because we want to grow the popularity but we also want to help the young people to take up our sport. I have this saying that if you can see it, you can be it. So if they go to a live and watch these WTA finals, I hope that it will inspire at least one girl out of that audience to say, \"I'm going to do that, I want to be out there just like them.\" And I think that's what's so wonderful in spreading our sport throughout the world.\n\nChristine Tan: Well, you've led the way in the fight for equitable prize money. It has been 45 years since you founded WTA. Looking back at your journey, what's been the most challenging changing that mindset?\n\nBillie Jean King: Well, Plan A was to have one association, men and women together. The men rejected us, and I went back a few times and they rejected us. I still think we should be one association. They don't think so, the men. So we did plan B, which I think we've done amazingly well, thanks to the leadership. You know, Steve Simon's done a great job, Larry Scott, Stacey Allaster and all the different ones through the years. Jerry Diamond in the beginning made a huge difference. Choosing really the right people to lead, and then also the players doing their job, not just playing tennis, but doing the media, doing the things that you have to do. We're in the entertainment business. That's one thing I always tell the players, \"we are entertainers\". It's our job to make the people happy not their job to come and watch us. And I think once a player understands that. She can do a much better job because it's not just hitting tennis balls and winning matches, it is way beyond that. This is our profession.\n\nChristine Tan: Well, the last U.S. Open was pretty controversial because everyone was talking about whether Serena Williams was treated differently than a male player. How do you see it?\n\nBillie Jean King: I think there should be coaching in tennis. I think that if they want a coach from the stands, it is fine, I don't care. I believe in coaching. I think it hurts our sport that we don't make the coaches a bigger part of it because they get more column inches as we say in newspapers. We get more attention when you have one more aspect of the sport have a lot of focus on it. I mean in America we talk about the coaches as much as some of the players. Especially like American football or basketball. And as coaching goes, people are very interested in coaching. It's about leadership. It's about what makes a player better, what's their relationship. Those are all kinds of things we're not getting enough of that in our sport.\n\nChristine Tan: So just to be clear, you're saying coaching should be allowed?\n\nBillie Jean King: Absolutely. It should be allowed and it should be free and easy. But on the other hand, right now the rule is no coaching from the stands. But guess what? As a player I have no control over my coach. He or she, whoever is coaching me, I have no control, so why should I get penalized? So most of the time, the umpire will give what they call a \"soft warning\". Because here's how it works, if you get a warning, you get a warning. The next time, you lose a point, and the next time, a whole game. So I know Serena because I've talked to her. She didn't realize she got a warning the very first time, she thought she got a soft warning. So that's where it started in the first place. So when she broke her racquet, she actually lost a point. She was confused and got really upset. And then, she thought the umpire was calling her dishonest. And if you know Venus and Serena, I've known them since 9 and 10 years old, the one thing they are is honest and you do not attack their honesty. You just don't. If you're an umpire you should know I'm not going here, because and she said \"Well I want you to apologize\". Well, umpire can't apologize and Serena knows she was out of line. She was totally out of line. It wasn't fair to Osaka. But once you see red and once you've just gone, and I knew with the honesty issue, she'd be gone and she was gone\u2026 crazed. So all he had to say to her is \"Serena, I'm not attacking your honesty\". That was all he had to say. The whole time this was going on I was going, \"Just tell her you're not attacking her honesty\". That's not apologizing but yes it is but in a different way. It would have been so easy. But he just kept looking at her. And I don't know what he was saying. Anyway, it was a mess. It wasn't fair to Osaka who's one of our obviously our new up and coming player, exciting and she played better than Serena.\n\nCHRISTINE TAN: So any words, any personal words of advice for Naomi Osaka who was visibly upset at the way the match turned out?\n\nBillie Jean King: She was upset but she knew she was playing better. And she was very focused. And I noticed throughout, she went away and let them go at it. She didn't get involved, she really handled it well. Naomi Osaka is here to stay. She's going to be a great champion. She already is a champion but she's got such amazing future. She's consistent. She's quick. Hope her serve gets better. But oh my gosh. She's a wonderful player and she's a really nice person. Her future is very, very bright.\n\nChristine Tan: CEO of WTA Steve Simon is advocating a couple of changes. One of them is that he wants to reduce the time it takes to play a match from 3-4 hours, to 60-90 minutes, because media consumption habits are changing. Do you agree with him? Are you giving him your full support?\n\nBillie Jean King: I've been talking about this for over 40 years. So, of course I'm going to agree with him because I thought this 40, 45 years ago. So yes of course I would.\n\nChristine Tan: But more importantly, you do think shortening the matches will actually increase viewership?\n\nBillie Jean King: Yes because I think people just can't concentrate that long anymore especially with social media. And you know you look at people looking at their phones, every seven seconds something new is coming out there. No, that's why you have highlights; you have just little snippets, which is why you have tweeting or Instagram or whatever. That's why people just want one or two sentences. So, Steve Simon, I totally agree with him that matches have to get shorter I've been saying that for my whole lifetime. And our job is to please the fans. Our job is to please the fans. We're entertainers. And that's the most important thing.\n\nChristine Tan: So when is it going to happen?\n\nBillie Jean King: Tennis is very slow in changing. I think we've been way too slow over the years. I think we could have done it much faster. But we haven't. People who are traditionalist want to hold onto it. And I totally appreciate that. I love history. And I think the more you know about history the more you know about yourself and understand your sport. But guess what, what do you learn from history: how to shape the future. If you analyze the changes that are going on, and how rapid the changes are going on, we need to be more rapid in our change and responding and reacting to people what they want.\n\nChristine Tan: As someone who has fought hard for equal prize money and equality. What more do you want to add to your legacy?\n\nBillie Jean King: Well, I'm not finished yet. That's the main thing with as far as legacy goes. I also have a Billie Jean King leadership initiative now, which is very important to me, to try to get equal pay in the workplace, by gender, by culture, obviously by race. So all that's very important, I want people to be their authentic self. I just I'm having fun. I'm going to be 75 in 2018, November 22nd so, I'm having a great time. I love to see how well our sport's doing. You know, our goals were that any girls born in this world would have a place to compete. We were losing tournaments a lot, so a place to compete. Number two, that we'd be finally appreciated for our accomplishments not just our looks, and also to be able to make a living. Because money provides mobility, it provides opportunity and hopefully the players who make a lot of money, will have foundations and give back to the world and make this world a better place.\n\nChristine Tan: And finally, where do you see the WTA and the future of women's tennis?\n\nBillie Jean King: The future of women's tennis is so bright. With the young people coming up, you think of the generations that built us to this point. I would like to do a shout out to Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova. They were the second generation that came after my generation. Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova took us just like a huge step forward and up. And those two were responsible for that. And because of that we had Seles, Steffi Graf. We had Hingis, we had the different players that followed them. But that second generation was so important to the foundation and the continuance of growth. And they just took it beyond all measures.\n\nChristine Tan: What's going to drive the sport forward from here?\n\nBillie Jean King: The young players today. They have to step up to go sell it. First of all, they're great performers, they're great players, great athletes. But now that we're going to Asia I think that's huge, we're going to have a whole new population to inspire. Someone's going to be dreaming, \"I want to be out there, I want to be number one in the world, I can do this.\" And that's just what happened with all the past champions. Chris and Martina did, Seles, Graf all of them and they did it. They had something exceptional. Everyone does have a blessing or a gift they just have to find it. You know what are your strengths in life? But they certainly were right to play tennis and tennis was really lucky to have them as well.\n\nSTEVE SIMON, Chairman and CEO, WTA\n\nChristine Tan: So for a few years WTA in terms of financials was kind of flat, as CEO of the WTA, what steps did you take to increase revenue, to really turn WTA around?\n\nSteve Simon: One of the things when I came on in and it's the foundation for everything that I'm going to do is that I believe you have to evolve. Business has to evolve, if you don't evolve, you're going backwards. And when I came on in, what was real clear, what was happening was that the business was evolving from what we used to call the linear world, to the digital world. And that creates a fundamental change in your business approach. Because when you go to the digital world, you've gone from business- to- business, to now, business direct to the consumer. So, that's a full change and so the whole focus...\n\nChristine Tan: Requires a whole new business model.\n\nSteve Simon: Whole new business model. So, the whole focus has been on driving audience. The first goal is audience, the second goal is audience and the third goal is audience, because audience is the key that unlocks the value. Now, we've got almost 600 million viewers that will be coming in this year which is great. This past year on the digital side, we've had over 300 million video views, almost up 20% and what that has done has translated now back into revenue streams.\n\nChristine Tan: Well you're going to be in Shenzhen for the next 10 years, it's a huge commitment on your part to move everything there for the next decade or so, what impact do you think China is going to have on WTA or vice versa, what impact do you think the WTA is going to have on women's tennis in China?\n\nSteve Simon: Well, I think it is what you just said - it is going to be vice versa. It has to be a trade-off or it doesn't work, and I think that we have seen right now. Through the investments we've made, this has solidified the investment we've made into China, and I think it's showing the market place we're here to stay. We weren't here just to see what we could extract, we're here to invest back into to you and we're serious, we've already seen the tremendous growth in China since we've started working there. We now have, with the Finals going there, we have 8 events in mainland China which is a large number, and most of the year-end circuit is going to be in Asia. In 2000, if my memory is correct, we had 1 player from China in the top 100, and since that time when we began investing into it, you've now had a Grand Slam champion in Li Na, and a role model which is huge. China now has I believe four players in the Top 100, another 15-16 players in the Top 300, well you can see the growth. I think that's absolutely wonderful and I think that's showing that there is a pathway in this great sport for young women.\n\nChristine Tan: The Shenzhen bid is giving you a $500 million indoor tennis venue, plus a record prize money of 14 million dollars. Has Shenzhen made this whole debate about equal prize money go away?\n\nSteve Simon: Unfortunately, the argument over equal will never go away. I think, definitely, it was a huge statement. It's a huge statement of the value of women's tennis, and of the value within the marketplace of these athletes. And I think it truly shows that we can be competitive with anybody in the world. This is about, I think, showing what investment does. We have invested significantly into Asia-Pacific region as a sport, especially women's sport, and the region has reinvested back into us. I think what this showed was that when you make a commitment, and we were willing to make a commitment on a long term basis to the region and say \"This is going to be the foundation\", these are the type of results you get.\n\nChristine Tan: Do you think Shenzhen is going to be a big attractive draw to bring in new sponsors for you?\n\nSteve Simon: Well I hope so, I mean everybody tries to do that and I do think we are going to...\n\nChristine Tan: You talking to anyone?\n\nSteve Simon: We talk to a lot of people every day. But I believe that the platform we're going to put there, the world will want to be a part of this great event and that great city.\n\nChristine Tan: What's the status of the tennis venue being built now? Can you give us an update? And whether it will be completed in time?\n\nSteve Simon: Yeah, so it's scheduled to be completed for the 2020 event, the first year we're going to have the event hosted in the Shenzhen Bay arena, so it's an established venue, but we're excited about the new venue which will be in the heart of downtown Shenzhen.\n\nChristine Tan: Did you have any input in the design of the venue?\n\nSteve Simon: Yes, we are having input into the design, it's obviously going to be a multi-purpose stadium, they're definitely building specific to a lot of our specs to host this event, and it's a very, very exciting project and something we're going to be very proud of.\n\nChristine Tan: One of the things you're also advocating is to reduce the time it takes to play a match, from three to four hours, to 60 to 90 minutes. How's it going so far, are you meeting with a lot of resistance?\n\nSteve Simon: Yeah, that's not one of the more popular topics in our sport because the tradition of it. And with it, and I'm going to continue to take the position that I do, is that I think we have to look at this. If you look at how much the game has changed, you don't play in long pants, long dresses, wood racquets, white tennis balls, things evolve. The game has evolved. It's become so much more physical and so much more athletic. I do think we have to look at the duration of the athletes on court because in our sport which is unique: they play every day, they don't get the days off. How do we keep the players healthy by protecting the integrity of the competition? Getting the match times down to 90 minutes, two hour matches versus three and four hours matches. As well as for the consumer, I think that the consumer is consuming product, entertainment, sports differently. And I'm not sure that our future fans want to sit there for four to five hours to watch something.\n\nChristine Tan: Whether it's changing the tour calendar or trying to reduce the time it takes to play a match, it's always controversial and challenging to try to make these changes, something the players and sponsors are used to. What sort of leadership are you providing behind the scenes to get people to embrace these changes?\n\nSteve Simon: Well I think when you're going to them to talk about change, if your track record has shown that the recommendations you make have moved the needle forward, and you have more wins than losses, they have a tendency to accept your ideas a little bit more. But it is always about the selling process and the vision, and being able to go in and say, \"Look, here's where we are today, I think this is where we need to get to, which we can all agree to, and here are the steps we need to get there and there's going to be all these changes.\" It's being able to have those honest conversations with everybody. It's important to have relationships so that they trust you and they know you're not trying to have a certain angle or try to get away with something. And I think that throughout the organization we have a lot of trust, a lot of confidence and people are willing to engage in conversation and talk and get comfortable with things that maybe aren't in their comfort zone all the time.\n\nChristine Tan: What do you do with people who don't buy into your idea?\n\nSteve Simon: Well if they don't buy into them, we obviously respect their position, but we're not going to let that stop us from moving where we need to go to. You need to get on the train and join us, or well, it was nice visiting with you, I hope we can work with you down the road but we're going to keep on going.\n\n\n\nChristine Tan: How does it feel like to be the man heading the all-women's tour?\n\nSteve Simon: When I came on in, I said it was a very humbling thing to be asked to do it. I was very happy doing what I was doing, I wasn't looking for a new job, but it was humbling to be asked to be provided a platform like this to get off the area of being in the cheap seat and always saying what you think they should do and actually be in a position to maybe affect it and move the sport and make it better than when you got there. So this one's unique because it's not only tennis, as you said, it's also women's sport. And one of the things that I think has to happen in this world is that people such as myself, as the male gender, we have to step up and truly show equality and begin making changes because they're the right thing to do. Not try to justify it; it's simply the right thing to do. And hopefully through example, we can show that that's what's happening here, and more of us need to do that.\n\nChristine Tan: What did you learn that you never knew before?\n\nSteve Simon: Well, you never stop learning for sure. I think it might be just the passion that's there for the sport. I've been in it all my life, I've been lucky, but when you think of the different relationship especially with the athlete today, these are amazing women and I don't say that lightly. They're great athletes, but what's unique to me is how much they want to learn, how much they want to understand, how much they want this to be their business. And I think that's one of the best parts of it.\n\nChristine Tan: As CEO of the WTA, what's your number one on your priority list for 2019?\n\nSteve Simon: Well, I never have just one because there's a list. But it is to continue pushing everything forward. It isn't one specific issue. It's the entire agenda of moving forward. I want this property, the WTA property to be considered on the equal of other world class properties. It's not the number one women's sport property; it's a property, irrespective of the gender. And for us to be able to walk into that board room and we're being looked at on an equal basis with the Super Bowls and the Olympics and the World Cups and everything else which is a brand. Not a male or female brand, it's a brand.\n\nENDS\n\nFor more information:\n\nClarence Chen\n\nCommunications Manager APAC, CNBC International\n\nD: +65 6326 1123\n\nM: +65 9852 8630\n\nE: clarence.chen@cnbc.com\n\nAbout CNBC:\n\nCNBC is the leading global broadcaster of live business and financial news and information, reporting directly from the major financial markets around the globe with regional headquarters Singapore, Abu Dhabi, London and New York.

Harley-Davidson is doing everything it can to minimize the impact of tariffs on its profits, he said.\n\nMarkets are now keeping their eyes on a much-touted meeting later this month between U.S. President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping at the G-20 in Buenos Aires, Argentina for any signs of easing tensions in the trade war.\n\nWATCH: Twelve US execs explain how Trump's trade war affects their bottom lines", "Australia remains open to Chinese investments regardless of whether Canberra blocks an acquisition of a major energy company by a Hong Kong-led consortium, Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told CNBC on Friday.\n\nEarlier this year, a consortium led by Hong Kong property developer CK Infrastructure \u2014 owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing \u2014 offered a $9.4 billion takeover bid for APA Group, Australia's leading energy infrastructure business.\n\nThe deal would be \"contrary to the national interest,\" Frydenberg said in a statement released Wednesday. Speaking to CNBC on Friday, Frydenberg said his preliminary view was \"not about a particular company or country.\"\n\nThe judgement call was based on \"what the implications would be for Australia were we to see a concentration of foreign ownership by a sole company in such a key set of assets as is the gas transmission sector,\" Frydenberg stated.\n\n\"APA is a unique company, with more than 50 percent of the gas transmission business in Australia, more than 15,000 pipelines supplying gas and electricity into key markets,\" he added.\n\nThe company holds approximately $20 billion of energy assets and delivers half the nation's natural gas usage, according to the company.", "WUZHEN, China \u2014 The head of Sequoia Capital's China affiliate said Thursday there are still big opportunities for growth in the country's digital economy, contrary to many concerns about a slowdown.\n\n\"As an investment firm enthusiastically participating in China's information industry, we still think the Chinese Internet sector has good prospects,\" Neil Shen, founding and managing partner of Sequoia Capital China, said at a press event at the World Internet Conference, according to a CNBC translation. \"Every year, our investment size and pace has been increasing.\"\n\nShen also said he believes the consumer-oriented internet still has a very big opportunity for future development, and that the industrial-oriented internet will develop quickly, especially with the support of artificial intelligence.\n\nSequoia is an investor in China's largest technology companies, including e-commerce giant Alibaba, ride-hailing company Didi and Meituan Dianping, which went public in Hong Kong this year. Shen is also a co-founder of Chinese tourism booking site Ctrip.com.\n\nMany worry China's burgeoning technology industry will be hit by a national economic slowdown. Some recent data reports have been soft, adding to concerns that increasing trade tensions with the U.S. will cause growth to slow even further. Beijing, for its part, has announced a slew of policy measures in the last few months to support the economy.\n\nShen, however, pushed back Thursday against concerns about trade tensions and a cold spell for the Chinese tech sector.\n\n\"My sense is the digital economy is something unique to China,\" he said. \"I don't think it will be affected that much by a U.S.-China trade war.\"", "Kolkata, still commonly referred to as Calcutta, is the capital of India's eastern state of West Bengal. It's now known for its gentle pace of life, but back in the 18th century, the city was British India's most important trading post and the showpiece of colonial power.\n\nIn addition to its history, the gateway to eastern India is famous for its food. Bengali cuisine has evolved over time, but Kolkata still remains an ideal place to experience the cuisine characterized in part by mustard oil and fish.\n\nThere are many very good restaurants in the city, but if you want home cooked Bengali food, then that's possible, too. Iti Misra is one of a number of home chefs that host lunches for visitors to the city: Cooking from her kitchen, Iti dishes out authentic Bengali cuisine and gives her guests a glimpse into local life.\n\nHome to prominent intellectuals, Kolkata is regarded as an artistic and cultural capital of India. In northern Kolkata, the oldest part of the city, you'll find the stately mansions of famous Kolkatans such as Nobel Prize-winning poet Rabindranath Tagore.\n\nThat area of the city is also home to the busy Kumartuli clay making quarter. There, potters mold lifelike religious idols for the city's many festivals.", "A powerful quake of magnitude 6.8 struck off the eastern coast of Greenland on Friday, the U.S. Geological Survey said.\n\nThe quake, initially reported as a magnitude 7.1, struck at 0149 GMT. Its epicenter was in a remote area 253 miles (407 km) east of Ittoqqortoormiit in Greenland.\n\nIt was strong enough to cause local waves in the Greenland Sea but was not expected to cause a tsunami in more populated areas, the U.S. Tsunami Warning System said.", "US crude oil just entered bear market territory \u2014 Here's where three experts say it's headed next 8:37 AM ET Mon, 12 Nov 2018 | 03:39\n\nU.S. crude prices fell Friday for a 10th consecutive session, sinking deeper into bear market territory and wiping out the benchmark's gains for the year.\n\nThe 10-day decline is the longest losing streak for U.S. crude since mid-1984, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nCrude futures fell for a fifth straight week as growing output from key producers and a deteriorating outlook for oil demand deepen a sell-off spurred by October's broader market plunge. The drop marks a stunning reversal from last month, when oil prices hit nearly four-year highs as the market braced for potential shortages once U.S. sanctions on Iran snapped back into place.\n\n\"The market's not tight. I think there are windows where you could perceive it to be tight, and I think the markets got caught into that,\" Christian Malek, head of EMEA oil and gas research at J.P. Morgan, told CNBC on Friday. \"The reality is that we're still in a world where we're overproducing and we've got surplus.\"\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude settled 48 cents lower at $60.19 on Friday. The contract is now down nearly half a percent this year. It fell as low $59.26 on Friday, its weakest level in about nine months.\n\nWTI fell into a bear market in the previous session, tumbling more than 20 percent from a nearly four-year high last month at $76.90.\n\nInternational benchmark Brent crude was trading 39 cents lower at $70.26 by 2:29 p.m. ET, down 19 percent from its recent high. The contract touched a seven-month low at $69.13 on Friday.\n\nBrent has fallen in nine of the last 10 sessions, but is still up more than 4.5 percent this year.\n\nOil prices spiked in early October on fears that U.S. sanctions on Iran, OPEC's third biggest oil producer, would thin out global petroleum supplies. However, the Trump administration granted temporary sanctions exemptions to eight countries, allowing Iranian crude exports to continue and easing concern about undersupply.\n\nAnalysts now expect the loss of exports from Iran to be less severe than anticipated.\n\nMeanwhile, the world's top three producers, the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia are pumping at or near records. Other OPEC members and exporting nations are also turning on the taps.\n\nPreliminary data this week suggests U.S. production has hit an all-time high at 11.6 million barrels per day.", "China's factory-gate inflation slowed for the fourth month in October amid cooling domestic demand for raw materials and ebbing manufacturing activity, underscoring rising economic pressure in the face of simmering trade frictions with the United States.\n\nThe consumer price index (CPI), meanwhile, remained steady in October from the previous month with food prices stable, official data from National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Friday.\n\nThe producer price index (PPI), a measure of the prices businesses receive for their goods and services, rose 3.3 percent in October from a year earlier, easing from 3.6 percent in September, the statistics bureau said.\n\nAnalysts polled by Reuters had expected the October producer price inflation rate \u2014 also used by economists as a rough gauge of industrial profit trends \u2014 would ease to 3.3 percent. On a month-to-month basis, the PPI increased 0.4 percent.\n\nEconomic momentum in China has been softening in the past months. President Xi Jinping said last week that the world's second-largest economy is facing \"growing downward pressure.\"\n\nUnderlying factory-gate inflation in recent months has been crimped by easing consumption, with China's fixed-asset investment growth hovering around record lows and industrial firms' profits falling since May.\n\nBeijing's clamp-down on financial risks had also slowed credit demand somewhat, while some mid-sized companies have struggled to pass on higher prices to consumers.\n\nPrivate and official factory surveys have shown worrying months-long downturn on export orders, suggesting Beijing's intensifying trade dispute with the United States is starting to put a strain on businesses.\n\nGovernment data on exports, however, has shown remarkable strength, likely due to shippers rushing to beat higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods due to come into effect at the start of next year.\n\nThe rising headwinds to growth have prompted Beijing to ramp up stimulus measures to spur domestic demand.\n\nChina vowed to lower import tariffs and further broaden market access during the week-long China International Import Expo on Monday.\n\nPolicymakers have also committed to boosting infrastructure investment in \"weak areas\" such as railways, highways and airports.\n\nRaw material prices increased 6.7 percent in October from a year earlier, down from a 7.3 percent gain in September.\n\nThe consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.5 percent in October from a year earlier, same as September's rate and analysts' forecast.\n\nOn a monthly basis, the CPI rose 0.2 percent.\n\nChina has set its consumer inflation goal at 3 percent for 2018, same as last year.\n\nThe state planner recently said there is no sign of accelerating consumer inflation and expected prices to remain within a reasonable range.", "Housing slump in Australia is not 'a big problem': NAB\n\n8:59 PM ET Thu, 8 Nov 2018\n\nAlan Oster of National Australia Bank says falling house prices in Sydney and Melbourne are a \"midterm correction\" and not a big problem for the country's economy.", "China has been violating an agreement with the United States aimed at stopping cyber espionage through the hacking of government and corporate data, a senior U.S. intelligence official said on Thursday.\n\nWhen asked if China was violating the 2015 agreement between then President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, National Security Agency official Rob Joyce said: \"We think they are.\"\n\nBut he added that the quantity and number of attacks had dropped \"dramatically\" since the agreement.\n\n\"While it's not black and white, (China) met the agreement or they didn't meet the agreement, it's clear that they are well beyond the bounds today of the agreement that was forged between our countries,\" Joyce said.\n\nIn September 2015, Obama announced he had reached a \"common understanding\" with Xi on curbing economic cyber espionage, but threatened to impose U.S. sanctions on Chinese hackers who persist in committing cyber crimes.\n\nThe two leaders said they agreed that neither government would knowingly support cyber theft of corporate secrets or business information.\n\nThe agreement, however, stopped short of any promise to refrain from traditional government-to-government cyber spying for intelligence purposes.\n\nThat could include the massive hack of the U.S. federal government's personnel office this year that compromised the data of more than 20 million people. U.S. officials have traced that back to China, but have not said whether they believe the Chinese government was responsible.\n\nThe United States and China will hold a delayed top-level security dialogue on Friday, the latest sign of a thaw in the countries' strained relations amid an ongoing trade row ahead of a planned meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Argentina at the end of November.", "The Food and Drug Administration plans to limit sales of most flavored e-cigarettes to vape shops and move forward with a ban on menthol cigarettes as it tries to curb \"epidemic\" levels of teen e-cigarette use, according to senior FDA officials, who asked not to be named because the proposal is not yet public.\n\nFDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb in September gave five e-cigarette manufacturers \u2014 Juul, British American Tobacco's Vuse, Altria's MarkTen, Imperial Brands' Blu E-cigs and Japan Tobacco's Logic \u2014 until Sunday to submit proposals on how to prevent youth e-cigarette use. He has said the FDA will share its own plan sometime mid-November. Senior officials said the agency plans to announce its plan next week.\n\nThe agency plans to prohibit sales of flavored cartridge-based e-cigarettes in convenience stores and gas stations, allowing them to be sold only in vape and tobacco shops that tend to enforce age restrictions better, the officials said. The FDA also plans to ban online sales until manufacturers implement FDA-mandated guidelines for age verification, the sources said. Gottlieb first raised the idea of this policy in an interview with CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in October.\n\nThe flavor restrictions will exclude menthol, meaning menthol vapor products will still be allowed to be sold in convenience stores and gas stations \u2014 until the FDA removes menthol cigarettes from the market. Officials worry that in removing menthol e-cigarettes from places where menthol cigarettes are sold, consumers might opt for conventional cigarettes.\n\nThis spring, the FDA took the first step toward implementing a rule that would ban menthol or other flavors from cigarette and e-cigarette products. The agency banned certain flavors in cigarettes in 2009, but menthol was excluded from those new rules, as were other tobacco products. Critics have repeatedly called for FDA to reverse this because research has shown kids are more attracted to flavored products.\n\nThe bans won't take effect immediately. It would likely take weeks, if not months, for the FDA to adopt new rules and the changes to impact consumers.\n\nE-cigarette manufacturers are expected to soon make public their proposals to the FDA, with the 60-day mark falling on Sunday. Altria has already said it will remove its MarkTen pod-based products and will stop selling all flavors except for menthol or tobacco in its cig-a-like products until the FDA reviews and approves them.\n\nPreliminary data show a 77 percent increase in high school students using e-cigarettes, Gottlieb told CNBC in October. The full study is expected to be released this month.\n\nWATCH:How Juul made vaping cool and became a $15 billion e-cigarette giant", "The U.S. government on Thursday filed a civil fraud lawsuit accusing UBS Group, Switzerland's largest bank, of defrauding investors in its sale of residential mortgage-backed securities leading up to the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.\n\nUBS was accused of misleading investors about the quality of more than $41 billion of subprime and other risky mortgage loans backing 40 securities offerings in 2006 and 2007, the Department of Justice said in a complaint filed with the federal court in Brooklyn.\n\nThe lawsuit came after UBS rejected a government proposal that it pay nearly $2 billion to settle, according to a person familiar with the talks who was not authorized to speak publicly about them.\n\nWhile UBS was not a big originator of U.S. residential home loans, U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue in Brooklyn said investors suffered \"catastrophic losses\" from the bank's failure to fully disclose the risks of mortgage securities it helped sell.\n\nA UBS spokesman and a Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the settlement talks, but the bank said it will fight the lawsuit.\n\n\"The DOJ's claims are not supported by the facts or the law,\" it said in a statement. \"UBS is confident in its legal position and has been fully prepared for some time to defend itself in court.\"\n\nU.S. officials are seeking unspecified fines against UBS under a federal law allowing it to pursue penalties up to the amounts the bank gained or others lost from alleged misconduct.\n\nThe case is one of the last addressing alleged misconduct in the pooling and sale by large banks of mortgage securities that were a major cause of the financial crisis.\n\nBank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Scotland previously settled."]
