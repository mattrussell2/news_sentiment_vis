["Asia Pacific markets traded mostly lower on Monday as investors remained cautious over global growth prospects while Chinese President Xi Jinping tried to position China as a globalization champion in a major speech.\n\nXi's opening speech kicked off the week-long China International Import Expo that seeks to promote the world's second largest economy as a major consumer of global goods. The event, announced more than a year ago, will stand in contrast to the ongoing trade fight between Beijing and Washington.\n\nDuring the speech, Xi repeated his rhetoric against protectionism and promoted his country as an advocate for international openness and cooperation. He discussed at length about the benefits of an open international economy and said that China is pursuing \"a new round of high-standard opening up\" to broaden market access to the rest of the world.\n\nThe United States has levied tariffs on an extensive list of Chinese products. Beijing, for its part, unsuccessfully tried to negotiate on tariffs by offering to buy more U.S. goods, but ultimately responded with duties on products from the U.S.\n\nThe impact of the ongoing trade war is being felt as companies report higher production costs and trim outlook. On Friday, Chinese tech giant Alibaba lowered its full-year sales forecast, citing concerns about the economic impact of the trade war.\n\nXi's speech at the expo comes a day before Americans head to the polls for midterm elections.", "David Stockman warns a 40 percent stock market plunge is closing in on Wall Street.\n\nStockman, who served as President Reagan's Office of Management and Budget director, has long warned of a deep downturn that would shake Wall Street's most bullish investors. He believes the early rumblings of that epic downturn are finally here.\n\nIt comes as the S&P 500 Index tries to rebound from its worst month since 2011.\n\n\"No one has outlawed recessions. We're within a year or two of one,\" he said Thursday on CNBC's \"Futures Now.\" He added that: \"fair value of the S&P going into the next recession is well below 2000, 1500 \u2014 way below where we are today.\"\n\nThis is far from the first time he's issued a dire warning. But this time, he suggests the latest leg down is an early tremor of the pain that lies ahead.\n\n\"If you're a rational investor, you need only two words in your vocabulary: Trump and sell,\" said Stockman, in a reference to President Donald Trump. \"He's playing with fire at the very top of an aging expansion.\"\n\nAccording to Stockman, Trump's efforts to get the Federal Reserve to put the brakes on hiking interest rates from historical lows is misdirected.\n\n\"He's attacking the Fed for going too quick when it's been dithering for eight years. The funds rate at 2.13 percent is still below inflation,\" he said.\n\nStockman cited the trade war as another major reason why investors should brace for a prolonged sell-off.\n\n\"The trade war is not remotely rational,\" he said. If the dispute worsens, it \"is going to hit the whole goods economy with inflation like you've never seen before because China supplies about 30 percent of the goods in the categories we import.\"\n\nHis latest thoughts came as stocks will try to build on last week's rebound. The S&P 500 gained 2.4 percent the week ending Nov. 2. However, the index is still down 6.9 percent over the past month.\n\n\"We're going to be in a recession, and we're going to have another market correction which will be pretty brutal,\" Stockman said.\n\nThe White House didn't respond to CNBC for a comment on Stockman's remarks.", "Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who also is the GOP's gubernatorial candidate, released a statement on Sunday calling for an FBI investigation into what his office called a \"failed\" attempt to breach voter rolls.\n\nIn making his claim, Kemp cited unusual activity on the state's \"My Voter Page,\" which provides residents information about their registration status and voting locations, while accusing Democrats of culpability.\n\nIn a statement, the secretary's office said: \"We opened an investigation into the Democratic Party of Georgia after receiving information from our legal team about failed efforts to breach the online voter registration system and My Voter Page. We are working with our private sector vendors and investigators to review data logs.\"\n\nKemp is running against Stacey Abrams, who has lobbed accusations of voter suppression in the hotly contested governor's race. On Sunday, Abrams called the investigation \"desperate,\" echoing the state's Democratic Party, which called the allegations \"100 percent false.\"\n\nThe organization added: \"This so-called investigation was unknown to the Democratic Party of Georgia until a campaign operative in Kemp's official office released a statement this morning.\"\n\nKemp's move was unusual, as it's rare for organizations to speculate on the perpetrator of a cyberattack prior to an investigation, because a common tactic of cybercriminals to use technology to mask their affiliation and location. Attributing cyberattacks to any individual or entity is a process that typically takes weeks or months by trained investigators.\n\n\n\nIn an earlier statement, Kemp's press secretary Candice Broce said, \"While we cannot comment on the specifics of an ongoing investigation, I can confirm that the Democratic Party of Georgia is under investigation for possible cyber crimes. We can also confirm that no personal data was breached and our system remains secure.\"\n\nA Department of Homeland Security official told CNBC the office would defer to the Georgia Secretary's office for any further comment, and acknowledged \"the State of Georgia has notified us of this issue.\"\n\nThe Georgia Secretary of State's office was not immediately available for further comment.", "With market watchers debating the future of the economy, the cruise industry is making a bold bet on the consumer.\n\nAnalysts say 17 cruise ships are expected to hit the market next year on the expectation that demand for cruising will rise as more baby boomers retire and the industry carves out new offerings.\n\nTo increase the capacity at ports, terminals are being built and expanded to ensure there is enough room.\n\nRoyal Caribbean invested $250 million to launch Terminal A at Port Miami, often referred to as the cruise capital of the world.\n\nRoyal Caribbean plans to bring a number of its ships \u2014 including the Symphony of Seas \u2014 to Terminal A and over time, lease it out to other cruise lines in the industry.", "5 Hours Ago\n\nIn a lengthy statement, punctuated with eight exclamation points, Trump said that while \"we may never know all of the facts surrounding\" Khashoggi's death, \"our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\"", "Toby Cosgrove has a new job.\n\nAfter decades running one of the world's most famous hospitals, Cleveland Clinic, he's helping one of Silicon Valley's most prominent technology companies figure out how to sell its technology and services into health care.\n\nCosgrove announced earlier this year that he's taking a position at Google as an advisor to the Google Cloud health care and life sciences team.\n\nSurprisingly, he's not fighting to win large cloud contracts at the largest hospitals.\n\nThat's because most hospitals have already invested hundreds of millions of dollars into on-premises IT systems from companies like Epic Systems and Cerner, including installation, upgrades and training. At Cleveland Clinic, for instance, Cosgrove was one of the first big customers to invest in Epic Systems' electronic medical record software.\n\nCosgrove doesn't see these companies moving their entire infrastructures to a hosted cloud system like Google Cloud, or the more popular rival products from Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nInstead, he wants to figure out what kinds of apps can be built on top of these systems to help hospitals start to modernize.\n\nIn his view, the \"killer application\" for health care is voice for applications like transcribing physicians' medical notes, which leverage technologies like machine learning and natural language processing. (Cosgrove isn't involved, but another Alphabet team, Google Brain, is looking at doing just that).\n\nCosgrove thinks it'll take time before hospitals and smaller clinics across the country are using voice technology as a mainstream application, whether it's from Google or an enterprising start-up.\n\n\"I think it's going have to be specialty by specialty and probably the hardest is going to be the primary care physician because they have to see everything that comes through the door,\" said Cosgrove.", "Google's Owlchemy Labs is experimenting with ARcore to take its games to the next level \u2014 by taking players on a virtual getaway.\n\n\"Vacation Simulator\" \u2014 a follow up to the lab's hit game, \"Job Simulator\" \u2014 is set in the year 2060. The premise involves robots (the same ones who stole most of humanity's jobs in \"Job Simulator\") doing some research, and discovering that when people were not working, they would take vacations.\n\nIn this particular simulation, however, robots creating the environment for humans are struggling to grasp the concept of vacation. Unlike \"Job Simulator,\" the new game will feature a significantly more expanded environment instead of different ones confined to dedicated levels.\n\nNot only will players have more landscape to explore, but they'll have more of a narrative, as robots interact more within the virtual reality (VR) simulation.\n\n\"There's multiple different zones on the beach itself where you can interact. You can go play in the water. You can go build sandcastles, grill hot dogs,\" and a few other things, said Owlchemy Labs' CEO, Devin Reimer\n\n\"The game is a much bigger undertaking than 'Job Simulator' was. It opens up a lot more interesting things inside VR,\" he added.", "T-Mobile CEO John Legere is selling his luxury New York City penthouse, located in the exclusive Central Park West neighborhood, for nearly $18 million.\n\nThe penthouse, part of the 16-story 91 Central Park West building, was recently listed by Compass Real Estate\n\nLegere appears to have struggled to find a buyer for the palatial apartment, and the price tag reflects a hot luxury market that's showing signs of cooling off. In February, the Wall Street Journal reported that the penthouse was listed for $22 million, and the current asking price of $17.96 million is almost exactly what Legere paid for it back in 2015. The apartment once fetched a price tag of $27.5 million.", "Open enrollment, the annual period where you can sign up for plans that fall under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 also popularly called Obamacare \u2014 has started.\n\nIn 2016, about 16 percent of Americans bought private individual health plans, which includes Affordable Care Act offerings sold on government exchanges, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nEvery year, millions of people have to make decisions about the kind of care they need. During the 2018 annual enrollment, for example, nearly 11.8 million people signed up or were automatically enrolled through the ACA.\n\nBut another choice, known as a short-term health plan, is much cheaper and designed to appeal to younger, healthier people, or people of any age who want to save money. Unlike ACA plans, you can sign up for them throughout the year.\n\nSide-by-side, these plans cost far less. A 30-year-old woman in Chicago buying an ACA \"Bronze\" plan, according to Shaun Greene, senior vice president of AgileHealthInsurance, would pay $219.57 per month. If she buys a short-term plan, she'd pay approximately $120.\n\nThe White House earlier this month made a couple of important tweaks to short-term health plans, to increase their appeal to consumers. That's on top of ending the penalty for not buying standard health-care coverage.\n\nYou can now use subsidies to purchase short-term plans, depending on your state and income level. Next year, California will no longer allow these plans to be offered. Other states have enacted limits on how many times a plan can be renewed; still other states have expanded renewals.\n\nClaire McAndrew, director of campaigns and partnerships at Families USA, an advocacy organization for health-care consumers, calls the change concerning and potentially illegal. \"Federal law is very clear that those subsidies are for standard health insurance,\" she said.\n\nThe danger is that consumers could be diverted from buying regular health insurance.", "Medicaid expansion is on the ballot in three states this year, where local Republican leadership have opposed the wholesale extension of the safety net program under the Affordable Care Act. Many GOP leaders have cited budget concerns.\n\nVoters in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah will vote on expanding Medicaid in their states beginning in 2019. If the measures are passed, it could lead to new Medicaid coverage for 325,000 people across those three states, according to an analysis by Avalere.\n\nThose ballot initiatives follow a successful binding referendum vote in Maine last year, where voters approved Medicaid expansion of the program to cover 70,000 low-income residents.\n\nHowever, victory at the polls in Maine has not yet translated into actual implementation. Outgoing Republican governor, Paul LePage, has refused to carry out the measure despite court orders. He has argued that the state cannot afford the long term budget implications of coverage expansion.\n\nMaine is one of half a dozen Republican-led states with tight gubernatorial races this year, and Democratic wins there could usher in a new wave of Medicaid expansion. Since the law was implemented in 2014, 34 states and Washington, DC have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to date.\n\nThe ACA provision extends health care coverage under the safety net program to low-income adults earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which amounts to $16,600 for an individual this year, and up to $33,900 for a family of four.", "As robots pack more and more items into Amazon's fulfillment centers, reaching high up on shelves to store and retrieve toiletries, electronics and household goods, the company is reconsidering how it accounts for space.\n\nOn last week's earnings call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said that Amazon could start using cubic feet, instead of square footage, to measure its warehouse footprint. That would change the measurement from one of sheer size to one of volume, and give a clearer picture of how Amazon is becoming more efficient as its inventory grows.\n\n\"We are debating whether the dynamics of the warehouse are changing, so that square footage may not be the main indicator \u2014 it might be cubic feet,\" Olsavsky said. He said that if the company makes a change it will provide more detail to investors, but he didn't say when a decision will come.\n\nAs of now, Amazon expects its warehouse footage space to grow 15 percent in 2018, slower than the 30 percent growth rate over the prior two years. At the end of 2017, Amazon occupied almost 200 million square feet of space in its warehouses and data centers.\n\nThe company is moving in the direction of vertical expansion, filling up multi-story warehouses, which is particularly important as it builds in more densely populated urban areas. So its actual use of a warehouse is no longer shown by just length times width but increasingly includes height.\n\n\"Amazon is getting more and more efficient at using the warehouse space in a three-dimensional way,\" said Suvrat Dhanorkar, a supply chain management professor at Penn State University.", "It's been a record-setting year for Applebee's and the restaurant is showing no signs of slowing down, even as its competitors are struggling with getting guests in the door.\n\nCheap alcoholic beverages and dinner deals lured in customers during the third quarter and helped boost same-store sales up 7.7 percent, John Cywinski, president of Applebee's, told CNBC. This is massive growth compared to the rest of the industry, which saw same-store sales up 1.2 percent in the same period, according to Black Box Intelligence data.\n\nCywinski said this was the best performance for the brand in at least 14 years and that both dine-in and to-go sales grew in the quarter. Dine Brands, Applebee's parent, reported its results on Wednesday.\n\n\"Applebee's is back to its roots,\" he said. \"The evidence is four consecutive quarters of growth, 43 consecutive weeks of positive comp sales, [and] outperforming every segment of the restaurant industry.\"\n\nCompetition in the industry is getting stiff. Customers have more choices than ever of where to eat, how to eat and what to eat. Mobile apps and delivery has made getting meals so easy, that some customers are cutting back on trips to restaurants in favor of having food show up at home. Cheaper grocery prices, too, have driven diners to cook more meals at home. These issues persisted in the third quarter, as traffic industry-wide fell 1.2 percent, according to Black Box.\n\nThis was not the case at Applebee's, however, Cywinski said. In the first nine months of the year, same-store sales were up 5.5 percent, the bulk of the gain came from increased traffic, he said.\n\nIn 2017, the company began a campaign of offering $1 margaritas, dubbed Dollaritas, an effort to bring in younger diners, who tend to prefer limited-service chains like Chipotle, Chick-fil-A and Taco Bell, where they can order and go. The chain also does monthly drink promotions like its Halloween-themed $1 Zombie drink, which was garnished with a gummy brain.\n\n\"The beverage program is important to us,\" Cywinski said. \"Half of our growth is dine-in and a good chunk of that is beverage driven.\"\n\nCywinski also sees another upside: \"Frankly, because [customers] are getting a great value on the beverage side, they tend to be ordering desserts and appetizers.\"\n\nApplebee's is not only getting more people to dine-in at its restaurants, but has also improved its to-go sales with curbside pickup. In the third quarter, off-premise sales grew 37 percent and now account for 10 percent of total sales.\n\nCywinski expects these sales to double to 20 percent in the next few years. In addition, the company plans to have delivery available at about 1,000 restaurants by the end of 2018.\n\nRaymond James analyst Brian Vaccaro upgraded Dine Brands shares to a strong buy from outperform in the wake of the earnings report, saying he had \"increased confidence\" in Applebee's ability to sustain its same-store sales gains in 2019.\n\nHe set a price target of $108 on Dine Brands shares on Thursday. The stock, which is up about 70 percent since January, closed Friday just above $87.\n\nWATCH:How takeout took over America", "Polls in most of Florida will close at 7 p.m. ET on Tuesday, with some red-leaning parts of the Panhandle that sit in Central time closing an hour later. Results will start coming in a bit earlier than in other high-stakes states such as Pennsylvania.\n\nIn a state that supported Trump after backing Obama twice, the major parties have realized the importance of energizing their bases. Obama held a rally in Miami on Friday for Gillum, Nelson and House candidates, saying that Tuesday \"might be the most important election of our lifetimes.\" Trump rallied in the state Saturday night for the second time this week, as he aims to boost his ally DeSantis.\n\nIn the race to represent the state of more than 20 million as governor, observers see a test of the country's future. Gillum, Florida's first black gubernatorial nominee who has served as mayor of Tallahassee, has pushed for Medicaid expansion, tighter gun restrictions, and supports Trump's impeachment.\n\nDeSantis, a former congressman who won the GOP gubernatorial primary with a big boost from Trump, has aligned himself with the president on cracking down on immigration, and repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhile the gubernatorial race has huge stakes for Florida's future, the House and Senate races will give better clues of what could happen in congressional races nationwide on Tuesday. Nelson is one of 10 Senate Democrats running in a state Trump won in 2016, and finds himself locked in a tight race with Scott. The two campaigns and outside groups supporting them have spent a staggering $180 million on the race, driven by Scott's personal $50 million investment in his Senate bid.\n\nSchale said that in each recent election cycle, \"where the country broke late is where Florida landed.\" Therefore, he said he would be \"surprised\" if Nelson wins but other Senate Democrats in tight races \u2014 such as Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Joe Donnelly in Indiana \u2014 lose.\n\nRepublicans hold a 51-49 majority in the Senate, and are currently favored to maintain or increase their advantage in the chamber. If the 65-year-old Scott, denies the 76-year-old Nelson a fourth term, it would bode well for the GOP's prospects nationwide.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats will try to flip several House districts in the Sunshine State, as they push to gain a net 23 GOP-held seats nationwide and win a majority in the chamber. Nonpartisan forecasters favor Democrats to win Florida's Miami-area 27th District, in a closer than expected race for a Republican-held seat in a district that Democrat Hillary Clinton won by 20 percentage points in 2016.\n\nNonpartisan analysts differ on their ratings for Florida's other competitive House races. But Democrats will try to unseat Republicans in the following districts:\n\nFlorida 26: Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo aims to defend Florida's southernmost congressional seat against Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell. The district also voted for Clinton. Along with the 27th District, it is considered a test of how well Democrats can mobilize Hispanic voters. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report considers it a toss-up, while the nonpartisan Sabato's Crystal Ball lists it as lean Republican.\n\nRepublican Rep.

Still, Schale thinks that if any candidates from the group of Baer, Soderberg and Carlson triumph, it could mean Democrats are \"having a very good night\" in the suburban districts they need to flip to take a House majority.\n\nAt the same time, difficulties for House Democratic candidates in flipping GOP-held Florida seats could portend problems in the party's bid for a majority.", "If you're among the millions of older U.S. workers who will say farewell to full-time work in 2019, now's a good time to make sure you're truly prepared.\n\nWhether you're viewing the next phase of life as retirement, semi-retirement or an unknown adventure, experts say the transition should get more than just a passing once-over.\n\nRoughly 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 every day, the age most often associated with retirement.

That's down from a nine-percentage point lead last month.\n\nThat slightly narrowing reflects rising interest in the election from the foundation of Trump's support: White men, especially older, less educated, less affluent ones in small towns and rural areas. Most noteworthy for a mid-term election, the 2018 campaign has seized the attention of voters at presidential-campaign levels \u2014 and Trump has helped Republicans wipe out the advantage Democrats held earlier in the campaign.\n\n\"There has been some method to his madness,\" said Republican pollster Bill McInturff, who conducts the NBC/WSJ survey with his Democratic counterpart Peter Hart. \"The base is coming home.\"\n\nThe results presage the possibility of a split verdict on Tuesday. With many battleground House races taking place in more affluent suburbs, the unusual Trump-era advantage Democrats continue to maintain among college-educated whites \u2014 especially women \u2014 represent a strong sign for their prospects of gaining or exceeding the 23-seat gain they need to recapture the majority.", "To hear President Donald Trump tell it, the U.S. economy is experiencing an economic boom unlike any period in its history under his leadership.\n\nA closer look at the numbers, though, show that claim is questionable.\n\nWith just days left before a critical midterm election, Trump has been barnstorming the country in a series of rallies reminiscent of his 2016 presidential campaign. This time around, he is touting his record on the economy, claiming to have created more jobs and expanded economic growth at a pace that not seen by any of his predecessors in the White House.\n\n\"Nobody has ever been president that has the greatest economy in the history of our country,\" Trump told reporters at the White House Thursday. \"This is the greatest economy in the history of our country.\"\n\nTrump touted the latest sign of economic strength in Friday's employment report, which showed a net gain of 250,000 new jobs in October, and wage gains of 3.1 percent from a year ago. That boost in wages was the best since April 2009, when the U.S. was emerging from the Great Recession.\n\nBy any measure, those are good numbers. However, they're hardly the \"greatest\" in U.S. history.\n\nA better way to compare Trump's record is to compare the overall gains in the economy since he took office with those of his predecessors, during the same period in their presidencies. When viewed in that light, Trump's record on most of those measures is decidedly average. Below are four data points that suggest Trump's claims just don't add up.", "For one, running the streets of New York City with the 50,000 other participants, surrounded by the throngs of spectators who line the streets, is surreal.

In their statement of demands, the protest's leading organizers linked themselves to movements like the teachers strike in West Virginia and the \"Fight for $15\" demonstrations by fast-food workers.\n\nIndeed, the San Francisco demonstration was even held in Harry Bridges Plaza \u2014 Bridges was an influential union leader in the early 20th century \u2014 and speakers spoke of his and other examples of historical labor organizing.

To Affordable Groceries, which have already spent more than $25 million on the campaign. These advocacy organizations are largely financed by the big beverage companies, the report noted, who are fighting anti-obesity efforts pushed by state and local governments.\n\nHealth advocates hope the tax on sugar-packed drinks will reduce consumption of them. They point to the fact that nearly 40 percent of Americans are obese, according to the Center for Disease Control. However, the beverage giants are pushing back by funding ballot measures and legislation that would block municipalities from imposing taxes on key goods and services, The Times noted.\n\nYet William M. Dermody Jr, a vice president with the American Beverage Association, an trade group, took issue with elements of The Times' story.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Dermody insisted the effort to reject food and beverage taxes was largely a grassroots effort being driven by a broad local coalition of citizens. While big companies like Coke and Pepsi were involved in beating back levies on food and drink, he insisted those efforts were not solely about sugary drinks.\n\n\"The beverage industry is standing with small business and consumers locally who want to keep their groceries affordable,\" Dermody said on Sunday \u2013 even as he acknowledged the industry had funneled \"significant\" resources into local efforts to push back on the levies.\n\nData provided to CNBC by the association showed the industry has contributed around $3 million in cash and in-kind contributions to initiatives in Oregon, and $20 million in the state of Washington.\n\n\"What this is about is people wanting to protect their groceries from excessive taxes,\" Dermody said. These are democratic [constituencies] and people are saying 'enough' to higher taxes\"\n\nMore than 30 countries already tax sugary beverages. Municipalities across the U.S. are now considering doing the same, and sweet drinks are already pricier in seven cities, including Philadelphia, San Francisco and Boulder, Colo.\n\nThat beverage companies dislike the tax initiatives is perhaps unsurprising.

What's more, at current levels, many still see short-term bond ETFs as good value now that rates have gone up from rock-bottom levels.\n\nSome of BIL's direct competitors, such as the PIMCO Enhanced Short Maturity Active ETF (MINT) and the iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (SHV)\u2014funds that own bonds with up to one-year remaining maturity \u2014 have seen similar success year-to-date with net creations in the billions of dollars.", "Up and down.

However, as the longest bull market in history possibly wanes, it can be helpful to turn your attention to your own timeline.\n\n\"If you have 40 years left to invest, a bear market right now is just noise and should be ignored; in fact, often celebrated,\" said Doug Bellfy, a certified financial planner at Synergy Financial Planning in South Glastonbury, Connecticut.\n\nOn the other hand, Bellfy said, \"A stock market crash that starts the day after you retire can cause a permanent lifestyle impact if all your money is invested there.\"\n\nHere's how you should react and plan for volatility by age.", "Berkshire Hathaway Inc, the conglomerate run by billionaire Warren Buffett, on Saturday said its quarterly operating profit nearly doubled from the year prior due to stronger insurance results and lower taxes.\n\nHelping the company's massive insurance operations were lower estimated liabilities from property and casualty insurance in prior years and lower taxes.\n\nThe year prior included major losses due to three U.S. hurricanes and an earthquake in Mexico. The company added that it had made $928 million in share repurchases in the three-month period.\n\nOperating profit in the second quarter rose to $6.88 billion from $3.44 billion a year earlier, and higher than the $6.11 billion expected by Wall Street.", "If you don't have a retirement plan, start by talking about it with your company.\n\n\"Sometimes the employer doesn't know that there's a need for it, so they don't look at the options available and set one up for their employees,\" said financial advisor Winnie Sun, founder at Sun Group Wealth Partners.\n\nBe sure to let your employer know that there are incentives for them to offer such a plan.\n\nThat includes tax credits that are available for employers who sponsor a retirement plan, according to Aaron Pottichen, senior vice president at Alliant Retirement Consulting.\n\nThe owner, your boss, could use the plan to shelter their own taxable income. And instead of paying bonuses in cash, they can instead contribute to the savings program \u2014 and build incentives for employees to stay, Pottichen said.", "Seldom have America's mid-term elections been watched so closely across the globe.\n\nThe reasons are clear enough: what impact they'll have on the competitive attractiveness of US democracy around the world, what clues they will provide about the durability of the Trump administration and its foreign policies and \u2013 hardest to calculate --the impact they will have on populist and nationalist momentum globally.\n\nOn the first issue regarding US democracy, allies are worried that the American model is losing traction, prompting Chinese leaders to promote their state capitalist model as a viable alternative for developing and developed countries alike.\n\nAs Stephen Hadley, former national security advisor to President George W. Bush, recently said to CNN's Fareed Zakaria, \"If you're worried about the United States, we have a lot of tools to run a successful foreign policy that is in our interests and can provide prosperity and security for our people. But our brand is not doing well internationally. There's a reason why people are taking seriously China's claim to have a new model. It's because ours doesn't look very good.\"\n\nDuring the Cold War, Soviet officials failed over time in making a credible argument that their Communist system could deliver social and economic progress.

Last week, the kingdom's public prosecutor Saud Al Mojeb said the attack was premeditated.\n\n\"No one should dare to commit such acts on the soil of a NATO ally again.

Obama hit on a common theme of Democratic campaigns - defending his signature 2010 health care law, while urging Americans not to embrace hostility and division in politics.\n\n\"We have seen repeated attempts to divide us with rhetoric designed to make us angry and make us fearful,\" Obama said in Miami. \"But in four days, Florida, you can be a check on that kind of behavior.\"\n\nObama was flanked by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, who faces former congressman and strong Trump backer Ron DeSantis, and Senator Bill Nelson, who is being challenged by the outgoing governor, Rick Scott.\n\nTrump's campaign stops were aimed at bolstering Republicans challenging incumbent Democratic senators in West Virginia and Indiana, states he won in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of Mike Braun, who is trying to replace Joe Donnelly in the Senate, Trump told a rally in Indianapolis:\n\n\"If you want prosperity for your family, safety for your children and security for your country, vote for Mike Braun.\"\n\nTrump was joined on stage by former Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight, who led the crowd in a cheer \"Go get'em Donald.\"\n\nOpinion polls and non-partisan forecasters generally show Democrats with strong chances of winning 23 additional seats and taking a majority in the House of Representatives, which they could use to launch investigations into Trump's administration and block his legislative agenda.", "A gunman killed two people and wounded five others at a yoga studio in Florida's capital before killing himself Friday evening, officials said.\n\nTallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo told reporters Friday night that the man shot six people and pistol-whipped another after walking into the studio, which is part of a small Tallahassee shopping center.\n\nThe suspect then fatally shot himself, DeLeo said.\n\nEarly Saturday morning, the Tallahassee Police Department identified the shooter as Scott Paul Beierle, 40.\n\nThe department identified the two people who were killed as Dr. Nancy Van Vessem, 61, and Maura Binkley, 21.\n\nVan Vessem was an internist who served as chief medical director for Capital Health Plan, the Tallahassee Democrat newspaper reported.\n\nCapital Health Plan issued a statement praising Van Vessem, the Democrat reported.\n\n\"As CHP's longtime chief medical director, Nancy has been a guiding, visionary force in our daily work to serve the wellness and health care needs of thousands of families in this community. Her dedication, caring, leadership, humanity, and experience made her one of the most respected, inspiring, and accomplished medical professionals in the state and country. Our hearts are filled with sorrow and prayers for her family. We all have been so blessed to have Nancy in our lives,\" the company said.\n\nFlorida State University President John Thrasher says Van Vessem and Binkley had ties to the university, the Democrat reported.\n\n\"To lose one of our students and one of our faculty members in this tragic and violent way is just devastating to the Florida State University family. We feel this loss profoundly and we send our deepest sympathies to Maura's and Nancy's loved ones while we pray for the recovery of those who were injured,\" Thrasher said in a statement.\n\nDeLeo said police are asking for anyone who saw something unusual around the time of the shooting to contact police. He said the shooter acted alone and authorities are investigating possible motives. He declined to say what kind of gun the shooter had.\n\n\"We're all very saddened and shocked by the events that occurred, but it's important that people understand that there is no immediate threat outside of what has already occurred this evening,\" DeLeo said.\n\nMelissa Hutchinson said she helped treat a \"profusely\" bleeding man who rushed into a bar after the incident. She said three people from the studio ran in, and they were told there was an active shooter.\n\n\"It was a shocking moment something happened like this,\" Hutchinson said.\n\nThe people who came in were injured, including the bleeding man who was pistol-whipped while trying to stop the shooter. They told her the shooter kept coming in and out of the studio. When he loaded his gun, people started pounding the windows of the studio to warn people.\n\nCity Commissioner Scott Maddox was on the scene. He said on Facebook, \"In my public service career I have had to be on some bad scenes. This is the worst. Please pray.\"\n\nElle Welling said she was leaving a liquor store across the street from the shopping center and saw at least three people loaded into ambulances.\n\n\"You don't think about this in Tallahassee and now you have to,\" said Welling, 26, who lives in the neighborhood.\n\nThe plaza is home to popular restaurants, a jewelry store, a framing shop, a hair salon and other businesses.\n\nErskin Wesson, 64, said he was eating dinner with his family at a restaurant located below the yoga studio when they heard the gunshots above them.\n\n\"We just heard 'pow, pow, pow, pow,'\" Wesson said. \"It sounded like a limb falling on a tin roof and rolling.\"\n\nThe restaurant's owner came by a short time later, asking if anyone was a doctor, Wesson said. His step-daughter is an emergency room nurse and helped paramedics for about an hour, he said.\n\nTallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who is the Democratic nominee for governor, broke off the campaign trail to return to Tallahassee. He earlier appeared at a campaign event with former President Barack Obama.\n\nLate Friday night, Gillum spoke to reporters near the scene of the shooting to say that he had visited in the hospital two people who were shot at the yoga studio. The mayor said they were in good spirits despite their injuries.\n\nGillum asked residents to pray for those who survived and those who were killed in the shooting.\n\n\"We all feel a sense of added vulnerability\" because of the shooting, the mayor said.\n\nRepublican Gov. Rick Scott, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, called DeLeo and the head of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to get details of the shooting.\n\n\"I will remain in constant communication with law enforcement. We have offered state assistance,\" Scott tweeted.\n\nTallahassee's crime and murder rate has been an issue in the governor's race, with Gillum's opponent, Republican former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, calling the capital Florida's most crime-ridden city, a claim that is incorrect."]
