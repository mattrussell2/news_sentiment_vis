["A crypto financial crisis is happening, says Coinshare's Demirors 7:49 PM ET Wed, 14 Nov 2018 | 07:47\n\nBitcoin had been coasting in recent months on fairly low volatility until \"things exploded\" Wednesday and prices tanked more than 10 percent, BKCM founder and CEO Brian Kelly told CNBC.\n\nKelly, a cryptocurrency fund manager, said the sharp downturn had to do with bitcoin cash, which splintered off in August 2017 from regular bitcoin with the goal of being able to process more transactions.\n\nBitcoin cash is doing a \"hard fork\" or \"effectively a software upgrade,\" Kelly said on \"Fast Money.\" \"When you do a software upgrade, everybody usually agrees. But in this particular case, everybody is not agreeing.\"\n\n\"So, we've got ourselves a 'crypto civil war,'\" he said, adding that some traders are concerned the bitcoin and bitcoin cash markets would run into a slowdown or \"chaos\" after the software upgrade.\n\n\"People started selling. That triggered stops. Everybody got concerned,\" Kelly explained. \"And that's what happened today \u2014 the entire market sell-down.\"", "Stocks in Asia were mostly higher on Thursday on the back of an apparent improvement in market risk sentiment after British Prime Minister Theresa May managed to persuade her cabinet to back her draft Brexit agreement.

In (particular), its mobile gaming business is actually doing better than what we have expected as well,\" Ronald Wan, non-executive chairman at Partners Financial Holdings, told CNBC's \"Street Signs\" on Thursday.\n\nWan did, however, voice caution over the outlook for the Chinese tech giant. He said much of the gains achieved in the third quarter were \"one-off capital market transaction(s)\" and also attributed the gaming business' strong performance to the launch of many mini-games.\n\n\"I think in (the) fourth quarter and even till next year, the company is still subject to a lot of uncertainty,\" he added. \"I think the price, you know, increment today may not be sustainable so I think investors should be cautious about that.\"\n\nThe mainland China markets, which have been closely watched as a result of Beijing's ongoing trade spat with Washington, saw gains.

But he said overall the domestic picture looks good. He described the global picture as a \"gradual chipping away\" at the pace of growth but said it is \"not a terrible slowdown.\"\n\n\"I'm very happy about the state of the economy now,\" he said in an interview with Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan. \"Our policy is part of the reason why our economy is in such a good place right now.\"\n\nThat confidence has translated into a commitment by the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee to continue to increase short-term interest rates in a gradual but steady manner. The committee has approved three quarter-point increases this year and is expected to go through with a fourth in December.\n\nPowell noted potential headwinds to growth, including slowness in housing and the potential that fiscal stimulus through tax cuts could wear off in another year or so.\n\nPowell has faced some criticism for the Fed's policy. President Donald Trump has been vocal in his belief that the central bank's interest rate policy is the biggest threat to the growth seen during his administration.\n\nFor his part, Powell has refused to be drawn into a public debate with the president, maintaining that the Fed is independent and will continue to do what it thinks is best to maintain economic growth while keeping inflation under control and ensuring financial stability.\n\n\"We have a very important job that Congress has assigned us: Serve the public,\" he said. \"That's our sole focus.

There are hundreds of thousands of organizations who need to buy enterprise software to measure the sentiment of their employees [and] their customers.\"\n\nSpeaking after SVMK's third-quarter earnings report sent shares of the software provider up over 13 percent in Wednesday's trading session, Lurie added that he was \"all in favor\" of the price SAP paid for Qualtrics.\n\nQualtrics, a direct SurveyMonkey competitor, was reportedly planning to go public at a value of roughly $6 billion before SAP stepped in. Now, Qualtrics' $8 billion price tag may make investors think twice about how to value SVMK, which currently has a $1.6 billion market cap. SAP declined to comment on this story.\n\nSAP's size also didn't seem to worry the SVMK chief, who said on \"Mad Money\" that even Alphabet's Google, which offers its own data-collection software, \"is not a competitor.\"\n\n\"If you look at our competitor [Qualtrics] here, they're going to be a division of SAP, a large European company,\" he told Cramer. \"We're steering into where Microsoft and Salesforce and Adobe and Google have real market leadership.

Even then, it would be competing with other legislation and would not necessarily come to the floor.\n\nTrump did not respond to shouted questions after his announcement about whether he had sufficient votes for the legislation to pass.\n\nThe bipartisan compromise on criminal justice reform has attracted support from a broad range of groups including law enforcement associations, the libertarian-leaning network operated by billionaire industrialist Charles Koch, and the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n\"These members have reached a bipartisan agreement,\" Trump said Wednesday. \"Did I hear the word bipartisan?

House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., was also in attendance.\n\nThe new legislation is expected to give judges more leeway to bypass mandatory minimum sentences in certain types of offenses and to reduce penalties for drug-related offenses. One key provision would lower the minimum sentence for those convicted under the \"three strikes\" policy from life to 25 years.\n\nThe compromise bill would also retroactively apply a 2010 law reducing the disparity in sentencing between different forms of cocaine. Critics say that sentencing disparity has contributed to disproportionate penalties against African-Americans.\n\nThe legislation would radically overhaul the nation's sentencing policies.

The following is a link to video of the full interview on CNBC.com: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/11/14/watch-cnbcs-full-exclusive-interview-with-liberty-media-chairman-john-malone.html.\n\nAll references must be sourced to CNBC.\n\nMalone: Disney in middle of unique content 'food fight'\n\nJOHN MALONE: They're throwing Hail Mary passes in content. They're disrupting the traditional studio architecture\u2014 going directly to talent, bidding against each other for anything that looks unique. I mean, this is going to be a food fight for a while. And you know if Disney gets in the middle of the food fight, they're just going to have to live up to their brand in terms of what they deliver. And they're got to figure out how to make it somewhat unique because you know their contents been out there forever, so people are used to getting it and not paying for it. Right? Or not understanding that they're paying for it, right?\n\nFABER: Right. Right.\n\nMALONE: So to make that transition \u2013 and the question is how much pain are they willing to suffer pulling back rights from existing distribution, so that they create this appetite or starvation even for their brand and their content. So that when they then offer it as a premium direct consumer service people are willing to say \u2013\n\nFABER: There's real value.\n\nMALONE: -- I should pay for it now.\n\nFABER: And guys, and Jim, that goes back to this question we've been asking when it comes to Disney certainly is: what's it all going to cost? What's the incremental cost going to be to the company as it of course tries to compete robustly with Netflix and Amazon? And John was sort of pining a bit on -- on that and on the evolving world, in terms of that food fight he was talking about where so much money is being spent for those who create the content.\n\nMalone: Disney lacks massive direct consumer relationships\n\nMALONE: They have great brand, there's no question. And they really know the entertainment of business. What -- what they don't have is a massive number of global credit cards. They don't have massive direct consumer relationships at this point and those are not easy to come by. You know, if you look at the other people in the space: Amazon, because of their retailing businesses and the creation of Prime has been able to tie into consumer interest pretty globally, and -- and so it's very easy for Amazon to sell an incremental service. You have Apple wanting to be in this space. Apple is the big gorilla.\n\nFABER: When you say wanting to be in this space what do you mean?\n\nMALONE: Wanting to develop a direct consumer entertainment relationship beyond music, let's call it into video. And I -- I -- we're estimating that Apple has probably 650 to 700 million direct consumer relationships, in which Apple has a credit card, a lot of information about the consumer. They've started to put money into original content and they're certainly having lots of discussions in and around the content industry to figure this out. And you know they want to drive their consumer interface technology, their ecosystem into the video space in the living room, more heavily than Apple TV has so far. And Jeff is on a roll with his fire stick and his prime and his content and so he's in the living room. And Alexa is a \u2013 is a voice-activated interface that that works well as well, thought-through well, well-engineered, interfaces with Netflix. I mean well engineered, okay. So the technology side, if Disney has a problem, okay, I believe it's going to be those two things: it's going to be the technology platform and it's going to be establishing those one-to-one consumer relationships.\n\nFABER: All that said, when I did put the direct question to him he does say he believes Disney will be the third significant entrant and successful entrant overtime in direct consumer after Netflix and Amazon. Guys.\n\nLiberty Media' John Malone on Comcast, Verizon and Charter\n\nCARL QUINTANILLA: Let's get over to David Faber as we said earlier at Liberty Media's Investor Day once again. David?\n\nFABER: Thanks, Carl. Yeah, earlier today I had a chance to sit down with John Malone, of course the man who helped create the overall company and as its Chairman also still sits on nine boards of directors. Always like to talk to John about, well, a variety of things in the larger media business and about deals themselves, something he's no stranger to. We talked about globalization. It's been a key theme of his through the years. In particular we talked as well about our parent company, Comcast's, decision to buy Sky. And we went on as well to talk about a deal that didn't happen last year, namely the sale of Charter Communications, of which Malone and Liberty own more than a 20% stake. The first question that I asked was did Comcast get a good deal in purchasing Sky?\n\nMALONE: Brian will shoot me if I say no. He paid a lot of money for Sky. I think the proof is going to be how he goes -- the bulk of the Sky business is UK and the bulk of the UK business is a satellite-to-consumer business. He has to make the transition from satellite distribution to internet transmission over time.\n\nFABER: It seems to have passed. Do you --\n\nMALONE: For now.\n\nFABER: For now?\n\nMALONE: For now.\n\nFABER: Do you regret it passed? Do you regret there was an opportunity there that wasn't seized given the stock is 328 right now?\n\nMALONE: Look, you're always worth more dead than alive in the business world. Right? And on any given day you can usually sell a company for more than its market trading value. So in the short run, would that have been something to pursue and if you know, we owned -- instead of a 328 stock and you know, we had $350 worth of Verizon stock, would we be better off? Would the future be brighter? You know, I don't know. I mean, I think clearly some of us on the board and in the company thought we should have more aggressively pursued some of those interests. I can tell you that the deals that were on the table would not have gotten anybody's support. Okay? So Verizon would have had to get more aggressive for that deal to have had any chance. The problem with Masa's overture was it wasn't deemed to be equal for all shareholders. And as a result, some of us felt a) that it would be awkward to propose it.\n\nFABER: At the same time \u2013\n\nMALONE: Do you think a T-Mobile/Sprint wanting to go into -- just look forward a few years. If it turns out that 5g is an attractive -- involves to be, demonstrated to be an attractive fixed solution, Charter will have a maturing high speed powered network in the part of the world it serves. Very incrementally positive to add a 5g on that-to-that platform.\n\nFABER: Right now, Hans Vestberg, who is running Verizon --\n\nMALONE: He's focused \u2013\n\nFABER: He's very focused on 5g,\n\nMALONE: -- he's focused on 5g --\n\nFABER: -- and they've been rewarded in the marketplace for doing so overtime. Last time when they went to 4g.\n\nMALONE: Well, let me point out, Charter is trading at, what, 9.1 times. Comcast attributed to that business maybe seven. Tom is being rewarded for a clear pure play leveraged cash flow growth buyback story. Not experimenting over here, not trying to buy a content company or a \u2013 right? So Charter is currently, and the Charter shareholders are currently being rewarded the same way -- with premium valuation and a big buyback program that gives liquidity to its shareholders. Okay? Now that is not my traditional way of building a business but it's Tom's, and it's working.\n\nFABER: And you clearly believe there may be another opportunity to revisit, if it makes sense, a sale of Charter at some point?\n\nMALONE: Correct.\n\nFABER: And perhaps Tom will be in a different place in terms of his view of value as well?\n\nMALONE: Yes. And, you know, Tom is a terrific operator, right? And so he's got a very clear vision. This is a stage, right, where Tom is basically saying \"Don't bother me with all this other stuff. I've got this focus and this vision and this challenge and I've got to get this done and once I've got that done then you guys, you naysayers, right, can say 'Now what should we do?' But if I don't get this done everybody will be disappointed.\" So I think for that board, in a year, two years this there will be a big question. Okay. \"Now what?\" \"Now we're generating this big free cash flow. Are we going to have an opportunity to steal an NBC Universal from somebody like Brian did?\"\n\nFABER: Really?\n\nMALONE: Yes, really. I mean, you don't know. Timing, timing, if you have dry powder \u2013\n\nFABER: Are you trying to get Brian to split the company? Is that sort of what I'm hearing here too, John? Are you --\n\nMALONE: No I'm talking about him being Brian.\n\nFABER: I see. Okay.\n\nMALONE: I think he made a fabulous transaction.\n\nFABER: Always a good place to stop, saying that our boss made a fabulous transaction. Carl, back to you.\n\nLiberty Media' John Malone on Netflix's 'massive lead' in streaming landscape\n\nFABER: Thanks, Carl.

Typically we do talk about, of course, the changing media landscape, something you and I talk about every morning at 9:00 with Jim as well. And certainly we tend to focus on Netflix. As has Mr. Malone for years now, by the way, in terms of originally his belief that the cable companies should have gotten together to try to combat it and his admission that, well, its place is fairly cemented when it comes to being the number one player. I did ask him: does he believe that that will continue?\n\nMALONE: They've got a massive lead in that space. It's difficult to imagine that anybody can displace them.\n\nFABER: Is there any chance that Netflix hits a wall at some point?\n\nMALONE: So far it's an equity play that is based upon growth, valuation of growth, and the general belief that there will be a point at which they can take their foot a little bit off the throttle, right? They demonstrated -- their stock really took off, David, when they could demonstrate pricing power. So when they raised their prices and didn't lose any material subscribers, I think the financial markets said \"Aha, glue,\" right? So if you have glue and you have growth and pricing power, right, now the question is how to manage that. So unless Reed, you know, which he won't, does something really nuts, I think it's a question of modulating their spend and coasting in to maturity, at which point they should be enormously cash generative. Okay? And the only thing that I can see that interrupts that is number two comes in and starts a price war. But I don't see why number two would start a price war, right? I think Netflix right now provides a pricing umbrella, and as long as the competitors come at it either under that price umbrella or, like Amazon is doing where it's a whole different bundle, right, I think there's clearly room for two or three global providers in this space coming at it from slightly different perspectives. So, you know, I think Netflix, will be very successful in my opinion. And I think Amazon obviously is going to be very successful. And the question is who's going to be number three.\n\nFABER: I think you've answered it to a certain extent. You expect it to be Disney.\n\nMALONE: I expect it to be Disney.\n\nFABER: One question that I also put to Malone is his future. In the last year he stepped down from the boards of Charter and Lionsgate, raising at least some questions as to whether he was pulling back to a certain extent. Here is what he had to say:\n\nMALONE: First of all, my wife has a health condition that makes it much more difficult for me to travel for business. So the travel obligations of being on boards that aren't where I am, you know, is a challenge for us. You know, we're coming up on 60 years of marriage, so you know, she's very, very important to me and that's number one. And then I have ISS and those types of people saying I'm on way too many boards to begin with and they're recommending, \"Don't vote for John, he's on 13 boards,\" or something. And so I'm still on nine boards.\n\nFABER: That's plenty.\n\nMALONE: And the guys who are on the boards representing our collective interests are terrific people. So I don't think we lose a beat. On Charter, for instance, they've invited me to be an emeritus. So I call in, I listen to the board meeting. I do it. I read the board material. I call in. I'm an insider anyway, because of my ownership, so I get lots of connectivity there.\n\nFABER: For those who view it in a larger context, \"Well, John Malone is pulling back,\" or \"He's starting to think about what he wants to do with his empire.\"\n\nMALONE: No. But I would say, David, as you get older you have other interests, right? And so you want to spread your time \u2013 I have a lot of philanthropy interests. I have a forestry business. I have a hotel business in Ireland, I have a big thoroughbred racehorse business. These all -- these all are personal interest things.\n\nFABER: \"As you get older, you have other interests.\" I'm trying to figure that one out myself, Carl.

Jeff Flake said Wednesday that he will refuse to vote on dozens of President Donald Trump's judicial nominees until a bill protecting special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe comes to a vote in the Senate.\n\nThe Arizona Republican, who did not seek re-election and will retire at the end of his term, made the announcement on the Senate floor minutes after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., objected to his attempt to bring up the bill.\n\n\"I have informed the majority leader that I will not vote to advance any of the 21 judicial nominees pending in the Judiciary Committee, or vote to confirm the 32 judges awaiting a confirmation vote on the floor, until S. 2644 is brought to the full Senate for a vote,\" Flake said in the final sentence of the speech, referring to the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act.\n\n\"This bill is designed to do one thing: protect the integrity of the Special Counsel's investigation, and spare it of any interference from the executive branch, including from those who may themselves be subjects of the investigation,\" Flake said.\n\nThe departing senator's speech was itself a rhetorical defense of the special counsel, whose team is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible coordination between Trump's campaign and the Kremlin.\n\n\"How such an investigation could be a cause of controversy is beyond me \u2013 surely we all recognize that it is essential to understand this new form of foreign aggression so that we might better defend America against such attacks in the future, right?\" Flake said.\n\nThe firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from overseeing Mueller's investigation, proved to Flake that the president has the Russia probe in his crosshairs. Flake maintained his stated view that the appointment of Sessions' chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, as acting attorney general was \"improper,\" even after the Justice Department cleared Whitaker for the role earlier.\n\nAs he has done numerous times from the Senate floor, Flake also criticized Trump directly. This time, Flake ripped Trump for appearing at times \"eager to accept [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's denials at face value\" when it comes to the U.S. intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered with the election in Trump's favor.\n\nFlake promised that he and Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who has partnered with Flake in the effort, would raise the legislation \"again and again\" until it is brought to a vote on the Senate floor.\n\nFlake has voted with Trump 84 percent of the time, according to political data site FiveThirtyEight. When he departs the Senate in January, his seat will be filled by Democrat Kyrsten Sinema, who defeated Republican Martha McSally in a tightly contested election.\n\nA spokeswoman for McConnell did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. A spokesman for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, also did not immediately respond.\n\nFlake's vote is crucial for the nominees currently moving through the Judiciary Committee, which comprises 11 Republicans and 10 Democrats. Republicans cannot lose Flake's vote if they want to advance those judges.\n\nBut if Flake is the only senator voting across party lines in the full Senate body, Vice President Mike Pence will be able to cast the tie-breaker vote and push those nominees through.", "WASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. wars and military action in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Pakistan have cost American taxpayers $5.9 trillion since they began in 2001, according to a new study.\n\nThat total is almost $2 trillion more than all federal government spending during the recently completed 2017-18 fiscal year.\n\nThe report, from Watson Institute of International and Public Affairs at Brown University, also finds that more than 480,000 people have died as a direct result of fighting.

But she also used her fashion choices to give added visibility to the people she was photographed with or the platform she was trying to promote.\n\n\"If people flipped through a magazine primarily to see the clothes I was wearing, I hoped they'd also see the military spouse standing next to me or read what I had to say about children's health.\"\n\nOther women in high profile positions have faced this same scrutiny. In 2015, a reporter asked Amal Clooney what she was wearing while the human rights attorney walked into court to represent Armenia in a genocide denial case. Clooney laughed and responded, \"I'm wearing Ede & Ravenscroft,\" a reference to a maker of legal robes, one of the oldest established tailors in England.\n\nFellow politico Hillary Clinton also faced intense scrutiny over her appearance and has said she wore her signature pantsuits in an attempt to control the conversation about her. \"Since there wasn't much to say or report on what I wore, maybe people would focus on what I was saying instead,\" the Democratic presidential nominee wrote in her memoir \"What Happened.\"\n\nTo be sure, Obama served as first lady, where optics are paramount. Obama wrote that her staff spent hours ensuring that the designers, colors and styles chosen for any trip paid the proper respects to the people and places she visited.\n\nStill, the focus on her style choices could sometimes be disappointing, she wrote. That said, it pushed her to find new ways to find power in her situation as a public figure, a role she said she would not have chosen for herself.\n\nWrote Obama, \"I tried to reframe it as an opportunity to learn.\"\n\nLike this story? Like CNBC Make It on Facebook.\n\nDon't Miss: Michelle Obama: 'It's okay to be bossy'", "Investors need to remember that this is a new industry and Canada is the first G7 nation to legalize the drug, so hiccups are to be expected. Both Willis and Brochstein think the long-term opportunity is huge, with Grand View Research saying the global pot market will be worth $146 billion by 2025.\n\nFor things to really take off, though, other countries need to legalize weed. Canada, with 35 million people, is a decent size, but it's small compared to everyone else. If the U.K. legalizes marijuana \u2014 and the country did just start allowing doctors to prescribe it \u2014 and Germany comes around, and if the United States legalizes it on a federal level, then it becomes an industry on par with tobacco or booze.\n\nIt will still be years before this happens, but Canada's foray into legal weed should push other countries to get there faster, Willis said. \"The U.K. did an about-face; it flipped in three months from not allowing medical prescriptions to allowing them,\" he said. \"That shows the power of what Canada has done.\"\n\nEven if you believe in the long-term opportunity, Willis suggests waiting until the second half of 2019 to buy in. Valuations are still too high, with some of the big companies trading between 20 to 55 times earnings, but they will come down over the next few months. Eventually, they should be more in line with tobacco and alcohol businesses, which trade at around 10 to 14 times earnings.\n\nAny investor feeling the cannabis itch should consider some opportunities in the United States, which is less regulated than Canada. American companies have fewer restrictions on how they can market their wares, and they have more strains to sell. They're much smaller, so they carry even more risk, but companies like MedMen or iAnthus, which have operations in multiple states, trade at lower valuations than their Canadian counterparts. Both are down 7 percent on Wednesday, but still up on the year.\n\n\"They're expensive, but it's not as crazy,\" Willis said. \"It's kind of like Canada in 2013.\"\n\nWillis said the best advice is to look for the lowest-cost producers \u2014 it is currently Aphria in Canada \u2013 and for businesses that seem to be closer to generating a profit. Tilray had the smallest net loss among the big three reports this week, though its loss did widen from the year-ago quarter. Willis said none of them are close to making a real profit. Aphria is the closest to breaking even and should be generating net income by the second quarter of 2019 (June-ending quarter). Canopy is the farthest away from breaking even.\n\nThe best advice for investors determined to bet on the cannabis sector: Be patient.\n\n\"This is a long-term story,\" Brochstein said. \"It's a huge market, and things will get better.\"", "Citron Research's Andrew left reiterated his bet against the Canadian cannabis industry Wendesday, telling CNBC that he's short Canopy Growth and Cronos Group in addition to his already disclosed wager against Tilray.\n\nFielding a question from \"Halftime Report\" host Scott Wapner, Left said his doubts on the space aren't confined to just one company.\n\n\"I'm also short Cronos, I'm short Canopy, I'm short Tilray. So I'm short a basket of the names,\" he said. \"Once the U.S. licensed producers come on \u2014 the faster it becomes legal in the U.S., the quicker the Canada names go lower.\"\n\n\"They won't get the exposure in the U.S., they're not players internationally,\" Left added. \"I don't care how many press releases they put out, they're not going to be shipping cannabis from Canada to Australia. Not happening.\"\n\nShares of the three Canada-based marijuana producers sank Wednesday between Left's comments and Canopy Growth's earnings results. Tilray shed 11 percent and Canopy fell 15 percent in the U.S., while Cronos dropped 5.4 percent in Toronto.\n\nLeft's midday remarks came hours after Canopy Growth's second-quarter revenues results missed even the most conservative Wall Street estimate.\n\nThe company's total revenue of 23.3 million Canadian dollars fell well short of the average analyst expectation of CA$60 million despite growing 33 percent from the prior year's second quarter. The results represent Canopy's first sequential top-line decline.\n\nTo be sure, only a few analysts cover Canopy, a fact that makes any consensus projection less precise.\n\n\"With business opportunities expanding globally, we continue to make significant investments in building our international team and footprint,\" Bruce Linton, Canopy's chairman and co-CEO, said in a press release. \"The completion of, to our knowledge, a world first Canadian export of a U.S. federally legal DEA permitted product, and the announced acquisition of U.S. federally legal hemp R&D specialists, ebbu, are critical stepping stones for our broader entrance into the U.S. market.\"\n\nOf the few analysts that cover Canopy, Canaccord Genuity's Matt Bottomley said he's not too concerned that Canopy's second-quarter results suggest disappointments going forward. He maintained his buy rating on shares following the earnings release.\n\nThe weaker revenue is \"a hiccup in getting products to Germany, along with minimal initial shipments into provincial recreational channels,\" he wrote to clients. \"We believe we will see higher recreational sales impacting the company's top line next quarter. Given the company's leading position with 70,000 kilograms in supply agreements (excl. Ontario), we believe this could amount to more than $300 million in revenues and can support the company's leading position in the recreational market.\"\n\nCanopy has been seen as a better bet in the cannabis space thanks to a $5 billion strategic partnership from international brewer Constellation Brands. Access to capital is seen by some analysts as key to the future success of marijuana companies, which are struggling to build up enough production to meet swelling demand.\n\n\"We think Constellation Brand's recent investment provides significant additional financial capacity and operational capabilities to become a leading CPG company, longer-term,\" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer wrote Monday, before the earnings results. \"We think that demand for Canopy's products remains strong. As we have highlighted in our e-commerce platform checks, Canopy has steadily grown its product listings amongst our five province sample, covering 65 percent of Canada's population.\"\n\nAzer had forecast Canopy posting revenue of CA$60 million.\n\nNeither Canopy nor Tilray reported a significant bump in sales thanks to recreational cannabis. However, this is likely unrepresentative because Canada's prohibition against adult recreational use was overturned at the start of the third quarter, on Oct. 17.", "Amazon is a continually expanding company, not just in terms of its number of headquarters but also in the number of industries it is invested in.\n\nThe tech company dominates the e-commerce industry and is taking on sectors like groceries and pharmaceuticals. Amazon requires a massive and organized workforce, both inside and outside of their distribution centers.\n\n\"We're obviously expanding globally and continue to grow in marketplaces around the world,\" Kelley tells CNBC Make It. \"We're in a lot of business and a lot of markets and expanding.\"\n\nThat means the first step of getting a job at Amazon involves narrowing down the opportunities and finding the position that best matches your skills. Search through the job openings on Amazon's career page and filter opportunities based on job category, job type and location to find the role that is right for you.\n\n\"People shouldn't just take a job at Amazon \u2014 or any other company for that matter \u2014 without understanding what parts of the employment value proposition are the most important for them and how that aligns with potential employers. For some, the move to Amazon will be a great move, for others it will be a bad one,\" says Kropp. \"The key is to understand what the jobs are actually like.\"\n\nHe continues, \"The best place to get that information about Amazon or any other employer is not by reading the material from that employer, it is by talking to people that worked or still currently work for that employer to understand what it is actually like to work there.\"", "Before every Congress officially begins, lawmakers have a chance to ask for specific committee assignments. Freshman lawmakers, such as Romney, usually are last in line and don't always get what they want. However, people around Romney, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the connections he has made to GOP leaders throughout the last decade could help him as he looks to join the committees.\n\nRomney became one of the faces of the Republican Party during his two attempts at running for president. He lost to Sen. John McCain in the 2008 GOP primary, but won the nomination in 2012, only to fall to President Barack Obama. Romney also previously served as governor of Democratic-leaning Massachusetts, where he signed into law a health insurance measure that set the standard for the federal Obamacare health reform law.\n\nIf Romney does pick up a committee chair, he would follow in the footsteps of fellow Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee, who made his way onto the Senate Judiciary and Foreign Relations panels as a freshman.\n\nRomney is known to be an occasional critic of President Donald Trump. In July, he called out the president after he appeared to side with Russian leader Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence agencies on the matter of Russian attacks on the 2016 U.S. election.\n\n\"President Trump's decision to side with Putin over American intelligence agencies is disgraceful and detrimental to our Democratic principles,\" Romney said at the time.\n\nFollowing the 2016 election, however, Trump considered Romney to be his secretary of State but later chose Exxon Mobil executive Rex Tillerson instead. Tillerson had a rocky tenure in the administration and was ultimately fired. Mike Pompeo now serves as the nation's top diplomat.\n\nBeyond working the halls of Capitol Hill as he seeks committee seats, Romney is expected to hit the Washington social scene on Wednesday and attend a party honoring Hatch at the Ritz Carlton, according to one of Romney's associates, who declined to be named. Party leaders, senators and lobbyists are celebrating Hatch's four-decade tenure in the Senate. There will also be an announcement at the event of a library being named after Hatch at the University of Utah.\n\nLee is planning to attend the gathering, his spokesman told CNBC. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., is also expected to attend the festivities, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nFlake's spokeswoman, Elizabeth Jones, said he is going to be attending a reception for Hatch but did not elaborate if that was at the Ritz.\n\n\"He'll just be at the reception \u2013 he's one of the keynote speakers at the RTCA [Radio & Television Correspondents Association] dinner and will need to head over there,\" she said in an email.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Orrin Hatch Foundation later confirmed Wednesday's gala.\n\n\"The Orrin G.

Jim Jordan, a co-founder and former chairman of the hard-line conservative House Freedom Caucus. McCarthy defeated Jordan by a vote of 159 to 43.\n\nMcCarthy in January will succeed House Speaker Paul Ryan, who will retire at the end of his current term, as leader of the House GOP caucus. Republicans elected current Majority Whip Steve Scalise as minority whip, which will make him the No. 2 member of the GOP caucus next year.\n\nMcCarthy will have to balance the demands of governing in the minority and leading a party that has increasingly cast itself in the mold of President Donald Trump. The GOP representative, who has himself drifted more toward Trump since the president took office, will also try to figure out how to vault a party that suburban voters wary of the president's party rejected at the ballot box last week.", "Macy's is testing smaller stores to save money, leaving it with room to bring in new concepts.\n\nThe company said it's picked four of its existing stores to test as \"neighborhood\" locations, where it will cut as much as a fifth of square footage, thereby trimming excess inventory and staffing. CEO Jeff Gennette said Wednesday during a call with analysts that Macy's will look in 2019 to see what format works best before deciding what it will roll out to other stores across the U.S.\n\n\"We want to create a vibrant destination,\" Gennette told CNBC Wednesday after Macy's reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings. \"When you look at what the customer needs, it's more about fulfillment and convenience. You need less space in order to do that.\"\n\nDespite the earnings beat and an increased forecast, Macy's shares fell nearly 6 percent Wednesday. The stock is up about 35 percent so far this year.\n\nIn rethinking its real estate, there are three ways Macy's could fill the leftover space in its \"neighborhood\" stores, Gennette explained.\n\nOne way is by partnering with other retailers. Macy's already has brought Starbucks and Sunglass Hut into its stores, for example. Gennette said it will continue to look at food-and-beverage concepts and other retailers that don't cannibalize what Macy's is currently selling. This mimics a similar initiative taken by Kohl's, which is dividing some of its bigger stores to make space for retailers such as Aldi.\n\nThe CEO added that other retailers could include those currently trying out Macy's recently launched pop-up marketplaces, which are in a handful of cities today. \"You could turn that [excess space] over to a suite of retailers,\" he said.\n\nThen, Macy's will consider bringing its off-price concept, known as Macy's Backstage \u2014 a competitor with the likes of TJ Maxx and Nordstrom Rack \u2014 to move into the space, Gennette said. The company has said its full-price locations with Backstage shops inside them are helping lift sales. Macy's currently has 166 Backstage locations open across the U.S., and continues to add more.\n\nLast, Macy's could use the extra space to fill online orders, like a mini-fulfillment center, according to Gennette. He said one location in a market could be used to reach surrounding homes, and even other Macy's stores. Nordstrom, similarly, is trying a small-shop concept known as Nordstrom Local in Los Angeles, where it can pull inventory from other surrounding shops and serve as a hub for online orders.\n\n\"We will test and iterate until we land on the right formula to scale,\" Gennette told analysts Wednesday.", "WASHINGTON \u2014 At least 13 countries have expressed interest in buying a Russian missile system instead of platforms made by American companies, despite the potential for triggering U.S. sanctions, according to people with first-hand knowledge of a U.S. intelligence assessment.\n\nOne of the people, who declined to be named, said that Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Algeria, Morocco, Egypt, Vietnam, and Iraq have all discussed buying the S-400 missile system from Russia. However, the U.S. expects that a handful of countries will fold to diplomatic pressure.\n\nThe S-400, a mobile long-range surface-to-air missile system, is the Kremlin's answer to America's Patriot and THAAD platforms. Lockheed Martin makes the THAAD, or terminal high altitude area defense, system, while Raytheon makes the Patriot.\n\nThe Pentagon deferred questions about this story to the White House, which did not comment.\n\nAny potential economic or political penalties would come under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which President Donald Trump signed in August 2017. In September, the U.S. slapped sanctions on China for buying fighter jets and missiles from Russia. However, the U.S. could grant waivers.\n\nChina, India and Turkey have already signed purchase agreements with the Kremlin. China, which is embroiled in a trade battle with the U.S., is in the middle of receiving its final shipment of the S-400 system. India, the top buyer of Russian arms, signed a deal with Moscow for the S-400 last month. Turkey, a NATO ally, is slated to receive its S-400 next year and is expected to have the system ready for use by 2020.\n\nWhen asked why nations seek to buy the S-400 instead of America's Patriot or THAAD systems, one of the people with knowledge of the intelligence report explained that foreign militaries aren't willing to stick with the cumbersome process of buying weapons from the U.S. government.\n\n\"Many of these countries do not want to wait for U.S. regulatory hurdles,\" the person said. \"The S-400 has less export restrictions and the Kremlin is willing to expedite sales by skipping over any regulatory hurdles. It's like buying it off the shelf,\" the source added.\n\nAlso, while it's not clear how much the countries would pay for either system, Russian arms are generally considered less expensive than U.S. weapons and come without extensive maintenance support.", "Following the news that Snap has been subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. Justice Department for allegedly misleading investors in its IPO, short-seller Andrew Left was bullish on Snap stock, saying he was surprised shares didn't dip lower on the news.\n\n\"I own Snap.

Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, dipped below $65 a barrel this week, tumbling from a four-year high near $87 over the last six weeks.\n\nThe market has pinned the pullback on a broader stock market sell-off in October, forecasts that see oil demand growing less than originally anticipated, and rising oil supplies from major producers.\n\nBut Jeff Currie, head of commodity research at Goldman Sachs, believes supply and demand is only part of the story. He says investor positioning and one trading strategy in particular are largely responsible for deepening the oil market rout in recent days.\n\nThat suggests the worst losses for crude futures are likely in the rear view mirror.\n\n\"Our base case is we'll bounce around here,\" Currie told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Wednesday. \"I like to think about it like a pinball machine, but eventually the momentum is going to be to the upside.\"\n\nCurrie says concerns about deteriorating demand for oil are \"overblown.\" More pressing, he says, is the surge in output from the United States and Libya, and the Trump administration's decision to allow eight countries to keep importing Iranian crude despite U.S. sanctions on the Islamic Republic.\n\nThose factors added about 1 million barrels per day to the market, he said, but they still does not justify a more than 20 percent pullback in oil prices.\n\nCurrie believes the rapid decline over the last few days was driven by momentum trading, a strategy in which traders buy or sell assets as the price moves decisively higher or lower. That momentum selling largely accounts for U.S. crude prices falling below $60 a barrel and toward $55, according to Currie.\n\nAt that point, another quirk of the market kicked in. When oil fell to about $55, it triggered selling by swap dealers, who had sold options to oil producers giving them the right to sell the commodity at that price level.\n\nHistorically, this environment can last for three to four weeks, Currie says. However, rising volatility in oil markets will discourage momentum traders, who like low volatility markets that are either trending higher or lower.", "Come to Nevada for the roulette tables.

That differential has been narrowing, and that suggests the market may be expecting some positive development for U.S. farmers on the trade front.\n\n\"Narrowing US-Brazil soybean price differentials imply greater market optimism on the potential for a Trump-Xi trade deal or at least a de-escalation of US-Sino trade tensions in advance of the G20. This positive sentiment stands somewhat in contrast to other asset markets, including equities,\" the Citi strategists wrote.\n\nEven with the 25 percent tariff on U.S. soy beans, the average soy price differentials have shifted from a 24 percent U.S. Gulf Coast discount to Paranagua in mid-October, to a 17 percent discount last week and 13-15 percent discount this week.\n\nThe strategists said the differential could partly account for any movement of U.S. beans to South America for local crushing or even re-export. \"We think it is mostly a reflection of the physical trade becoming more optimistic about a 'surprise' breakthrough for US-China trade relations. Indeed, Brazil premiums to CBOT futures have also collapsed, from over 250 cents to below 200 cents over this period while soybean prices in Brazil for delivery into China have also fallen in both US$ and BRL terms,\" they wrote.\n\nThey also note that options traders on the CBOT seem more optimistic about U.S.-China trade and are factoring it in to prices.

Acosta traveled to Paris over the weekend to report on Trump's trip for the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, but \"he was told that he would not be allowed to access the President's events\" even though the French government had given him a press credential.\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Caller published Wednesday, Trump railed against Acosta and said his White House ought to win the lawsuit. \"Is it freedom of the press when somebody comes in and starts screaming questions and won't sit down?\" Trump asked.\n\nAt a news conference on Nov. 7, Acosta disputed Trump's use of the word \"invasion\" to describe a so-called caravan of Central American migrants traveling toward the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\"As you know, Mr. President, the caravan is not an invasion,\" Acosta said. \"It's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the U.S.\"\n\nAcosta continued to ask Trump questions as the president tried to move on to other reporters. A female White House intern approached Acosta and attempted to pull the microphone from his hands. Acosta initially refused to give up the mic. \"Pardon me, ma'am,\" Acosta said to the woman, still holding the microphone.\n\n\"You are a rude, terrible person,\" Trump said to Acosta at the time.\n\nSanders initially suggested the hard pass was revoked because Acosta was \"placing his hands on a young woman,\" a characterization that received immediate pushback. The White House response was further criticized after the press secretary tweeted a video of the exchange, which The Washington Post and other outlets said was doctored.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sanders' language changed to accuse Acosta of having \"physically refused\" to surrender the microphone. The White House's court filing only cited the more recent characterization.\n\nAs part of the legal response to CNN, the DOJ lawyers argued that \"Acosta's decision to engage in conduct that disrupts press events and impedes other reporters from asking questions provides a more-than-sufficient reason for revoking his hard pass.\" They also denied, as CNN had argued, that Acosta's pass had been revoked \"because the President and his administration do not like CNN or Acosta's reporting.\"\n\nMeanwhile, media organizations and journalists have offered statements of support for CNN. Fox News President Jay Wallace said in a statement that \"Secret Service passes for working White House journalists should never be weaponized.\"\n\nThe president of the White House Correspondents' Association, Olivier Knox, said Tuesday: \"Revoking access to the White House complex amounted to disproportionate reaction to the events of last Wednesday. We continue to urge the Administration to reverse course and fully reinstate CNN's correspondent.\"\n\nIn a joint statement, a bevy of other major news networks Wednesday, including NBC News, The New York Times, The Washington Post and Politico, came out in support of CNN:\n\n\"Whether the news of the day concerns national security, the economy, or the environment, reporters covering the White House must remain free to ask questions. It is imperative that independent journalists have access to the President and his activities, and that journalists are not barred for arbitrary reasons.

The first two revolutions were about mass production. The third turned us into knowledge workers bound in offices. This revolution is about breaking free of geography. It is being driven by the technology to help us do that.\n\nFourth industrial revolution change is coming from both sides: People want better lifestyles, and businesses are in hiring pain.\n\nPeople know that place-bound work no longer makes sense. Collaboration technologies, like Microsoft's Office 365, Slack, Google Hangouts and Atlassian, along with the ability to find work online via sites like ours, make it possible to work anywhere. The number of U.S. freelancers who found projects online increased 22 points in the past five years \u2014 from 42 percent in 2014 to 64 percent in 2018.\n\nWhile technology is the main enabler, another major force is hiring pain and huge talent shortages. The most talented professionals are increasingly used to being able to call the shots and shape their lives as they want to live them rather than as traditional 9-to-5 work requires. This means companies who want access to them need to allow remote work.\n\nWhat is your view on Yahoo, Bank of America, Aetna and IBM eliminating their work-from-home policy?\n\nThese remote-work policy reversals are extremely shortsighted. Forcing workers back into offices is archaic and a great way to lower the quality of your team. Top professionals will not trade the way they want to live to fit a company's policy. They will find new work with companies more open to remote work. The team members who are less motivated, lower performers are more likely to stay.\n\nCompanies that revoke remote work privileges not only risk talent loss, they signal that they are not a fit for future top talent, especially among younger generations coming of age at a time when flexible work is an option they're well aware of.\n\nReversing remote work policies is also the wrong thing for America. Big companies have social responsibilities. With so many areas of our country struggling, it's backward-looking for companies to make decisions that take away jobs from regions that need them most. That is exactly what these remote-work reversals do.\n\n\n\nYou had mentioned that the concept of the workplace is \"dead,\" yet organizations in this country haven't changed how they operate inside their four walls since Henry Ford created the 9-to-5 workday. Why are they so slow to change?\n\nThis brings to my mind the fable of the boiling frog. If a frog is suddenly put into boiling water, it will jump out. It senses danger immediately and takes action to save itself. But if a frog is put into water that is slowly brought up to a boil, it will perish because the change is so gradual, the frog doesn't perceive danger until it's too late.\n\nThis is the situation we are in with organizational change. Without having reached a boiling point, it's easier for companies to do more of the same than to revisit their assumptions. So they keep conducting painful searches to find people who can drive into their offices and sit, unnecessarily, bound by four walls. Meanwhile, local costs of living are going up. Commutes are increasingly painful. And every year, things keep getting a little bit worse. But because there hasn't been a major crisis, organizations having trouble finding the people complain but don't jump into action. Just because something is gradual does not mean it's okay not to rethink it. People need to wake up.\n\nWhen do you think companies across America will finally embrace this change?\n\nWithin the next 10 to 15 years, because of generational shift. Millennials will be the next CEOs and CXOs. Gen Z is going to take all of this as a natural way of working. They are flexible work natives. Many baby boomers will be out of the workforce, and Gen X will be starting to move out as well. Younger generations will see the trade-offs in quality of life and think traditional models are ridiculous. This is similar to how digital natives changed the way we use technology. As younger generations take management reins, remote-work and flexible-work models will just be the norm to them. They'll hire more remote people and empower their teams to work that way. Research points in this direction, too. Five times more hiring managers expect more of their team to work remotely in the next 10 years than expect less.\n\n\n\nWhat type of companies do you see getting disrupted if they don't soon embrace remote work?\n\nFortune 500s are seen as somewhat invincible \u2014 they're far from it. When the F500 list first came out in 1955, they had an average lifespan of 75 years. The average lifespan of an F500 company today is less than one third that \u2014 15 years. Only 12 percent of the original F500s remain on today's list. It's easier for smaller, younger companies to evolve so it's even more critical for F500s to embrace remote work if they want to prolong their lifespan.\n\nAgencies and traditional staffing firms are also ripe for disruption. Companies that hire via online marketplaces or build flexible remote teams can access the same quality talent at much faster speeds and usually with lower overall costs than they'd get via these traditional sources since they're going direct to the talent. The majority (90%) of hiring managers are open to working with freelancers rather than through a staffing firm, according to Future Workforce Report. Staffing firms that evolve will do better than the ones avoiding change and agencies themselves can move online to create a more distributed model.", "Alibaba Singles Day may not boost stock 10:49 AM ET Wed, 14 Nov 2018 | 01:21\n\nChina's largest online shopping event, Singles day, was Sunday \u2013 and from a sales-perspective, it didn't disappoint.\n\nThe shopping event, started by Alibaba 10 years ago, racked up over $30b in gross merchandise value \u2013 nearly a 27% gain from last year - setting a record for the company.\n\nTo put that in perspective, total online sales in the U.S. for Black Friday totaled just $5b in 2017.\n\nThe growth was driven by Alibaba's \"New Retail\" strategy, which brought together 180,000 brands and 2000,000 smart stores from the company's ecosystem.\n\nBut shares of Alibaba tend to sell off after the event.\n\nIn keeping with history, shares of Alibaba sold off November 12th, something the stock has done in the four previous Singles Days that it's been a public company.\n\nAnd a month later, the negative sentiment tends to continue.\n\nThe stock loses another 4 percent, a negative trade 75 percent of the time - underperforming the S&P.", "Waters is likely to take over as chair of the committee following the midterm elections that gave back House control to the Democrats. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican, currently presides over the committee.\n\nIn addition to Wednesday's remarks, she has indicated she might use subpoena power to investigate President Donald Trump's connection to Deutsche Bank and whether it loaned Trump money that was guaranteed by the Russian government.\n\nSince Trump began his term in early 2017, the administration has sought to loosen the regulatory reins imposed by the Dodd-Frank reforms that came into being after the financial crisis that exploded in 2008. In particular, the White House and the Fed have worked to tailor capital rules to be less onerous on regional and community banks.\n\nWaters seemed to direct her comments specifically to the bigger institutions, particularly the too-big-to-fail banks that helped trigger the crisis. She made her comments shortly before Quarles said the Fed is looking to further ease up on community banks.\n\n\"It is essential that the Fed keeps a watchful eye on the financial institutions it supervises and makes strong use of its existing enforcement tools to crank down on institutions that break the law,\" she said. \"I must say that I am concerned about proposals the Fed has put forth this year to reduce capital and liquidity requirements for the largest financial institutions which would weaken strong safeguards established by Dodd-Frank to protect the U.S. economy from another costly financial crisis.\"\n\nThere was some conciliation, though. Waters said the press and even some of her colleagues have wrongly portrayed her relationship with Republicans, and she hopes they can cooperate.\n\n\"I look forward to working with you in any and every way that I can,\" she said.\n\nWATCH: Trump's appointments in key agencies show focus on international coordination", "Leaving the European Union without a transitional trade deal would cost Britain about 6 percent of GDP -- roughly four years of economic growth -- compared with staying in the bloc, the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday.\n\nThe IMF, which warned of the costs of Brexit before Britons voted to leave in June 2016, said securing a trade deal would roughly halve the economic damage from trade barriers and reduced foreign investment and immigration.\n\n\"Directors emphasized the importance of a timely agreement with the EU, accompanied by an implementation period to avoid a cliff-edge exit in March 2019 and to allow firms and workers time to adjust to the new relationship,\" the IMF said.\n\nTwo months ago, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said she expected the world's fifth-biggest economy would shrink outright if it left the EU without a deal.\n\nThe IMF's estimates -- part of a regular review of Britain's economy -- come as Prime Minister Theresa May is attempting to secure her top ministers' agreement to a transitional deal, which will then need approval by parliament and the EU.\n\nSome supporters of Brexit have argued that Britain would be better off leaving without any deal with Brussels if they cannot secure their full demands, trading instead under World Trade Organization rules.\n\nThe IMF forecast this would carry a cost. \"In a scenario in which the UK and EU trade under World Trade Organization rules the level of output is likely to fall by between about 5 and 8 percent relative to a no-Brexit scenario, with an average of about 6 percent,\" the IMF said.\n\nBritain's economy has slowed since the Brexit vote. Its annual growth rate fell from the top of the G7 group of nations to near the bottom, as businesses put investment on hold and higher inflation reduced households' disposable income.\n\nSome euroskeptics in May's Conservative Party say a \"no-deal\" Brexit would allow Britain to reach trade deals with third countries more easily and determine its own regulations.\n\nBut May favors a transitional arrangement that she hopes will preserve free trade in goods, though not services, while placing controls on immigration from the EU.\n\nThe IMF said this type of free trade agreement would reduce British GDP by around 2.5 to 4 percent -- probably about 3 percent -- over an unspecified long-term period, compared with staying in the EU. May has ruled out staying in.\n\nBefore the referendum, the IMF estimated Brexit would have a short-run cost of between 1.4 percent and 5.6 percent of GDP, depending on the terms of departure.\n\nThe effect of Brexit would vary widely between industries, the IMF said.\n\nBritain's financial services, chemicals and automotive industries were likely to suffer most from new regulatory barriers and disrupted supply chains. By contrast, farms, food processors and oil and mining companies might do better.\n\nGovernment programs would be needed to retrain British workers for these jobs, the IMF added.", "The slate of Senate leaders for both major political parties will be picked in closed-door elections Wednesday, and while most of the top brass are expected to hold onto their power, a few key shifts are expected.\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., cruised to re-election as majority leader. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., was re-elected minority leader, NBC News reported.\n\nBoth leaders were all but assured to retain their positions in the wake of the midterm elections last week, where Republicans expanded their gains in the Senate by defeating multiple red-state Democrats.\n\nThe majority leader is the highest-ranking member of the Senate, followed by the majority whip. The two leaders represent the Republican party on the Senate floor and gather votes for legislation. The policy committee chair leads the committee's research efforts for Republican senators, while the conference chair and vice-chair manage the party's communications strategy.\n\nMcConnell, 76, who has served in Senate leadership longer than any other Republican, has not been challenged by his party since becoming leader in 2006, according to NPR. He's held a vice grip on the role even as he remains among the least popular senators in the country, a Morning Consult survey from October showed.\n\nBelow him, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, is leaving his No. 2 position as Majority Whip in accordance with the Senate GOP rules imposing a three-term limit on most of the top slots. He will be replaced by GOP Sen. John Thune of South Dakota \u2014 a promotion from his prior post as GOP conference chairman. That role goes to Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., who is current Republican Policy Committee chairman.\n\nMissouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt rises to Policy Committee chairman, leaving his current slot as GOP conference vice-chair open. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, beat Sen.

In that chamber, a band of red-state representatives elect in the party have already pledged not to vote for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to become Speaker of the House. But there appear to be few, if any, serious challengers to Pelosi for the role, and she has made it clear that she is \"a hundred percent\" confident she will become Speaker.\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., won his bid for House Minority Leader on Wednesday, defeating Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, who was backed by the conservative House Freedom Caucus. The top Republican post in the Democrat-controlled House grew competitive after Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., announced in April that he would not seek re-election after the end of his current term.\n\nWith its GOP majority intact, the Senate is expected to be a bulwark for President Donald Trump against the House, whose likely Democratic committee leaders have promised to launch investigations into the president's finances and further their probes of Russian election meddling.\n\nThis is a developing story.

Government data last week showed the amount of natural gas in U.S. storage facilities rose by 65 billion cubic feet to 3.208 trillion cubic feet, 15 percent below the year-ago level and 16 percent below the five-year average. That was also the lowest amount of gas in storage during a first week of November, since 2003, according to Kilduff.\n\n\"It looks like more of a short squeeze than anything else. There's more cold weather on the horizon. A couple of the weather forecasts strengthened,\" said Kilduff. \"Any kind of cold weather blast early season like this is going to cause anxiety and concerns about really tight supply as we get deeper into the winter.\"\n\nMark Fisher, MBF Asset Management CEO, tied the volatile morning trading to the unwind of a popular hedge fund strategy.\n\n\"What's happened is you had a tremendous number of macro funds that...for years have been basically buying oil, selling natural gas, and traders have done tremendously well, and in no short period of time this trade has imploded, and I'm sure there's a ton of people getting margin called out of that trade. They're being forced to buy nat gas and sell crude oil, and that has added to this new debacle in energy,\" said Fisher in an interview on \"Squawk Box.\"\n\nThe U.S. is the world's largest producer of natural gas, and gas prices have been tame in recent years. Gas prices were last above $4 per mmBtu in 2014, the year of the extreme cold weather, known as the 'polar vortex.'\n\n\"The March, April spread is blown out almost as much as the front month [futures contract],\" said Gene McGillian of Tradition Energy.\n\n\"That suggests the market got flat footed...We haven't seen this type of price strength since the polar vortex and that came on the heels of bitter cold in the winter of 2013/14,\" said McGillian. \"Here it is the middle of November, and we have an explosive situation primarily with extremely low storage levels and a reminder of what demand can be with a long, cold winter. That has created a volatile cocktail in the market.\"\n\nAnalysts said gas in storage fell as hot weather lingered into October, resulting in higher air conditioning use. Unlike other years, there was no break between air conditioning and heating use.\n\nSome analysts say U.S. exports are adding to the storage shortfall. The U.S.exports gas in the form of liquified natural gas on ships, as well as via pipeline, to Mexico.\n\nWATCH: Here's what drives the price of oil", "Renowned energy trader Mark Fisher on Wednesday said the \"worst is over\" for the crude oil market following a six-week rout that has seen U.S. crude lose over a quarter of its value.\n\nThe MBF Clearing founder and CEO said he'd be a buyer right now rather than a seller.\n\nThe market outlook for crude oil has recently flipped. Investors were worried about a shortage of oil as U.S. sanctions shrank Iran's crude exports. But the market now expects supply to outstrip demand as the outlook for consumption growth weakens and Washington allows some Iranian crude shipments to continue.\n\nHowever, Fisher theorized that much of the drop in oil prices is due to macro funds getting out of the crude trade and rotating into natural gas futures. He argued that for years, buying oil and selling natural gas has been a huge winner.\n\n\"In no short period of time this trade has imploded,\" he said. \"And I'm sure there is a ton of people getting, you know, margin called out of this trade, where they're being forced to buy nat gas and sell crude oil, and that's added to this ... new debacle.\"", "CNBC to Host Summit on Monday, December 3 in San Francisco\n\nEnglewood Cliffs, N.J.

Disney will have to carve out market share in a space dominated by Netflix as other tech giants like Amazon and Apple continue to invest in original streaming TV shows and movies.\n\n\"Amazon, because of their retailing businesses and the creation of Prime, has been able to tie into consumer interests pretty globally, and so it's very easy to sell an incremental service [like Amazon Prime Video],\" Malone said. \"Apple has probably 650 to 700 million direct consumer relationships in which Apple has a credit card [and] a lot of information about the consumer, so [it's] relatively easy for them to offer an incremental service.\"\n\nDisney sees billions of guests to its theme parks each year, and Malone predicts the company will market to those consumers.\n\nBut with billions of dollars pouring into original programming for over-the-top services, Disney is stepping into the middle of a \"food fight,\" he said.", "Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday he is \"beginning to see the first signs\" of inflation in the U.S. economy, speaking in an interview with Bloomberg Television .\n\n\"We're seeing it basically in the tightening of the labor markets first, which, as you know, have gotten very tight now.

The state of Maryland cited that claim when it filed a lawsuit Tuesday challenging Whitaker's appointment, calling him an \"unqualified\" partisan.\n\nBut NBC News reported Wednesday that the department told Trump, before he tapped Whitaker for the job, that he could appoint Whitaker as acting head of Justice.\n\nWhitaker was named to the post a week ago, after Trump forced out Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nHis temporary appointment immediately sparked concerns that he will squelch the ongoing investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller's office into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and possible coordinating with the Trump campaign in that effort.\n\nWhitaker before joining the Justice Department had been a critic of Mueller's probe.

We haven't quite seen the internal thrust that we like to see off durable lows,\" he said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Futures Now.\"\n\nIn a post-midterm election rally a week ago, for example, the move higher had a ratio of 4 to 1 advancers to decliners. Mills said a stronger \"internal thrust\" is seen when that ratio reaches at least more than 5 to 1.\n\nHistorical data also suggest markets have to return to October lows before they reach a bottom, said Mills.\n\n\"Go back to 1981, we've seen 21 declines of 10 percent or more and typically over 70 percent of the time you see a retest of that initial low so I think that's what we're living through right now but fundamentals still support us moving higher through 2019,\" he explained.\n\nThe S&P 500 has moved more than 4 percent higher since it bottomed out at 2,603 on Oct. 29. At those lows, it had fallen more than 11 percent from its record high of Sept. 21.\n\nEven after the S&P 500 bottoms out, Mills expects elevated volatility for markets that could spook investors. Typically, the late stage of a cycle is characterized by tightening monetary policy and flattening yield curves, two factors that tend to roil markets.\n\n\"I think there's a road higher, but \u2026 I think it could be bumpy,\" Mills said. \"We're moving into this market phase where higher volatility is probably here to stay to some degree.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 remains nearly 2 percent higher for the year, while the Dow has added almost 3 percent.", "The \"Fast Money\" traders shared their first moves for the market open.\n\nTim Seymour was a buyer of JPMorgan\n\nBrian Kelly was a buyer of Dunkin' Brands\n\nSteve Grasso was a buyer of Alibaba\n\nGuy Adami was a buyer of Cleveland-Cliffs\n\nTrader disclosure: On November 13, 2018 the following stocks and commodities mentioned or intended to be mentioned on CNBC's \"Fast Money\" were owned by the \"Fast Money\" traders: Tim Seymour is long ACBFF, AMZA, ACB, APC, APH, BABA, BAC, BIDU, BX, C, CCJ, CGC, CLF, CMG, CNTTF, CRON, CSCO, CWEB, CX, DAL, DIS, DPZ, DVYE, EA, EEM, ERJ, EUFN, EWM, FB, FXI, GE, GILD, GM, GOOGL, GTII, GWPH, HAL, HK.APH, HYYDF, INTC, ITHUF, JD, KHRNF, KSHB, LEAF, MAT, MCD, MJNE, MO, MOS, MPEL, MPX, MRMD, NKE, OGI, ORGMF, OTC, PAK, PHM, PYPL, RH, RL, SBUX, SQ, STZ, T, TIF, TGOD, TRSSF, TRST, TWTR, UA, UAL, VALE, VIAB, VOD, X, XLE, XRT, YNDX, 700.

The neurological disorder is usually found in infants and typically causes respiratory failure and death within two to three years.\n\n\"Potentially saving lives is appealing to me,\" Cuban told CNBC in an e-mail. He declined to provide the size of this investment, but Perlstein said a typical program requires funding of between $250,000 and $750,000. \"Rare/orphan diseases, by definition, have catastrophic consequences for the families affected,\" he said.\n\nCuban and Perlstein came together over a Twitter debate about drug pricing last year, and Cuban said by e-mail he plans to do more of this kind of investing.\n\nPerlara calls itself a public benefit corporation, a for-profit company that counts doing good for society among its corporate goals. For Perlstein, that means incorporating patients in the company in a more direct way, and taking a different approach to pricing potential medicines.\n\n\"We staked our whole brand on wanting to make a downward dent on drug pricing,\" he explained.\n\nPerlara's still a way's away from pricing a drug: it plans to start human testing of its first two projects next year, for NGLY1 Deficiency and PMM2-CDG, both extremely rare genetic diseases. Only about 800 people have been identified worldwide with the latter.\n\nIt's aiming to tackle both of those through \"PerlQuests\" as well, a system Perlara established to work with families or patient groups that want to invest in research.\n\n\"Right now we're living in a world where those families are told if you just raise a few million dollars for gene therapy, that's your panacea,\" Perlstein said, referring to technology that delivers a health copy of a gene to make up for one that causes disease.\n\nPerlara aims to find more near-term solutions at a lower cost by creating disease models in worms, flies, yeast or fish, for example, and then screening existing compounds to see if there may be therapeutic activity.\n\n\"For a tenth of the cost, we're building animal models and finding repurposing opportunities,\" Perlstein explained.\n\nThe goal, then, isn't necessarily a cure, but a therapy that can help treat the disease for the years it may take to develop one.\n\nThat's the focus of Cuban's investment to develop treatments for Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder that can be caused by mutations in one of more than 75 different genes.\n\n\"Families affected by rare disease are ready to move mountains, but they lack the financial resources to do so,\" Cuban said in a statement from Perlara. He said by e-mail he does expect a return on his investment, \"but we aren't looking to maximize ROI. We are looking to maximize health and wellness.\"\n\nHe noted a successful treatment for the disease could also hold implications for \"aging, sports medicine, traumatic brain injury, neurodegeneration and other indications.\"\n\nAs for drug pricing? Cuban's still interested in in it, pledging to \"significantly reduce the pricing of all orphan drugs we invest in.\"\n\nSo far, Perlara is his only investment in drug discovery or development, he said.\n\nHis take on the industry's pricing practices more broadly is blunt: the \"price of drugs,\" he said, \"is too damn high.\"", "Taking time at work to focus on mastering a new skill, learning a new software program or tool, or even just reading widely about your industry can do wonders for you mentally \u2014 as well as professionally.\n\nNew research conducted by LinkedIn found that the best way to ensure that you're happy at your job is to spend more time learning.\n\nAmong the professionals surveyed, those who were \"heavy\" learners \u2014 devoting more than five hours a week to things like reading, taking classes and watching online courses \u2014 reported being happier, less stressed, more productive and more confident than those who spent less time learning.\n\nFor instance, when compared to \"light\" learners, those who commit an hour or less each week, heavy learners were:\n\n74 percent more likely to know where they want to go in their career\n\n48 percent more likely to have found purpose in their work\n\n47 percent less likely to be stressed at work\n\n39 percent more likely to feel productive and successful\n\n21 percent more likely to feel confident in their work\n\nAnd finally, 21 percent more likely to be happy at work\n\nHeavy learners see almost three times as many positive results as light learners says Josh Bersin, an HR industry analyst who developed the survey with LinkedIn.\n\nThose who said they spent between one and five hours a week on education also had much happier work lives than the light learners (though not as happy as those of heavy learners.) They reported being 14 percent happier than light learners did, 13 percent less stressed, 16 percent more productive and 32 percent more likely to know where they want to go in their career.\n\n\"There is a clear relationship between time spent learning and a person's career satisfaction, career prospects and general happiness,\" says Bersin. \"People who either have the time or make the time to educate themselves are performing at higher levels.\"\n\nThe bad news? Few of us are actually heavy learners.\n\nOf the 2,049 workers surveyed, including freelancers and entrepreneurs, in the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, Iceland, Denmark, Finland, Norway, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, France, Australia, India, Singapore, and Hong Kong, only 7 percent said they spent five hours or more a week learning. That number may even skew a little high, admits Bersin, as LinkedIn only queried people who had recently paid for some form of online learning with the company.\n\nMost of people fall into one of the two other learning groups: 47 percent are \"medium\" learners, spending 1-5 hours a week educating themselves, and 46 percent are \"light\" learners, spending less than an hour a week.\n\nIt's an understandable reality, when you consider that two-thirds of workers already spend more than 40 hours a week at work performing necessary tasks. Bersin says that one key way to free up time in your week for more learning activities is simply to cut back on communications.\n\n\"One of the big messages I took out of this research is that people are so distracted at work that they need to force themselves to limit interacting,\" says Bersin.\n\nThings like email, social media and meetings eat up so much of a person's day that it leaves little extra time for this kind of learning, he adds. More than a quarter of people admit they waste a day a week on emails and messages that don't contribute to their jobs, the survey found.\n\n\"This is also a call on leaders and management to recognize that they need to give employees time to improve their core skills,\" says Bersin. \"It will pay off.\"\n\nLike this story?

He said the next proposal would be aimed at a leverage ratio proposal for community banks.\n\n\"We expect that this proposal would meaningfully reduce the compliance burden for community banking organizations, while preserving overall levels of capital at small banks and our ability to take prompt action when problems arise,\" he added.\n\nIn the most recent changes, the Fed put banks into four categories for leverage requirements but stressed that size was only one factor it would use in determining how much of a buffer banks would need. Beyond assets, the central bank said it would consider nonbank assets, short-term wholesale funding and off-balance-sheet exposure.\n\nThose changes were aimed primarily at easing conditions for banks with between $100 billion and $250 billion in assets.\n\nDodd-Frank reforms after the financial crisis sought to increase capital buffers, decrease risk-taking and institute a procedure for unwinding banks that fell into the \"too big to fail\" category.\n\nHowever, President Donald Trump has said some of those efforts went too far, and the administration has sought to loosen the reins for community and regional institutions while still keeping protections in place for larger institutions.\n\nQuarles said the reforms have largely worked and the system overall is in solid shape.\n\n\"The banking sector remains in strong condition, in line with strong U.S. economic performance, with lending growth, fewer nonperforming loans, and strong overall profitability,\" he said.\n\nHe did note that several areas of concern remain that the Fed is monitoring closely, with a particular focus on cyber and technology risks.", "Analyst remains bullish on market despite volatility\n\n8:45 AM ET Wed, 14 Nov 2018\n\nJeff Saut of Raymond James joins 'Squawk Box' to discuss markets amid volatility on trade news and oil concerns.", "What Ilieva makes each year varies but, in a typical year she brings in between $80,000 and $150,000, primarily as a brand consultant.

And if history is any indication, that may signal trouble for the broader market.\n\nThe Russell 2000, comprised of small-cap stocks, has taken it on the chin in recent weeks. On Wednesday, the index's 50-day moving average crossed beneath its 200-day moving average \u2014 what would be the \"death cross\" formation.\n\nThe index has also plunged 13 percent from its high at the end of August and sliced through its 200-day moving average amid widespread selling in October.\n\nThe last time the Russell 2000 saw a death cross, in 2015, the index plummeted another 17 percent to the so-called Dimon bottom in early 2016.\n\n\"Sometimes I'm quite skeptical on death crosses. Not only do you need the 50-day and 200-day moving averages to cross, but they both have to be declining. That's not always the case. Another thing is that it works really well with some assets, and not so well with others. For instance, it doesn't work well with gold, sending mixed signals all the time. However, in this case, they both work,\" Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Trading Nation.\"\n\nIn other words, not only are both moving averages declining, but the death cross for the Russell 2000 has served a reliable indicator over the years.\n\n\"If you took all four of the death crosses we've seen since the credit crisis, the average decline is about 14 percent. That doesn't even include the 42 percent decline we saw in 2008,\" Maley said, adding that he'd never advise forming an opinion about the market solely on a single technical indicator.\n\nOthers are more optimistic on the group's next move.

It has to back off,\" he said.\n\nTypically, gold and the greenback move in opposite directions. So, as the dollar softens, it should provide a positive catalyst for the yellow metal.\n\nHowever, LaForge doesn't believe it'll create enough momentum to push gold back above its record high of $1,891.90 hit in 2011. Rather, he predicts $1,300 an ounce within the next 12 months, an 8 percent gain from current levels.\n\n\"$1,200 [an ounce currently] is not so bad when you look around at all these different assets prices getting crushed,\" he said.\n\nGold is down more than 8 percent so far this year. LaForge cites a glut in the precious for much of the sluggishness.\n\n\"We're still working off all the excesses from when gold was at $1,900,\" LaForge said. \"When that happens, when you have excess supply like we do in the system, your bounces just don't become as meaningful.\"", "U.S. consumer prices increased by the most in nine months in October amid gains in the cost of gasoline and rents, pointing to steadily rising inflation that likely will keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates again next month.\n\nThe Labor Department said on Wednesday its Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in September.

The stock has rallied more than 80 percent from a year ago. And some analysts say they're still waiting to see if Macy's can pull off a strong fourth quarter, where it faces tougher comparisons.\n\n\"This is only the start of Macy's journey,\" GlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders said. \"A lot more work is still needed to make Macy's a unique and compelling retail destination.\"\n\nHere's what Macy's reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:\n\n* Earnings per share: 27 cents, adjusted, vs. 14 cents expected\n\n* Revenue: $5.40 billion vs. $5.41 billion expected\n\n* Same-store sales: up 3.3 percent, on an owned plus licensed basis, vs. growth of 2.8 percent expected\n\n\"We are ready for the fourth quarter,\" CEO Jeff Gennette told CNBC. \"I think the backdrop for consumer spending is good, their confidence is strong, the dotcom business is really humming. \u2026 For stores, we are going into the fourth quarter in a healthy place with momentum.\"\n\nMacy's reported fiscal third-quarter net income of $62 million, or 20 cents per share, up from $30 million, or 10 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Macy's earned 27 cents, ahead of the 14 cents expected by analysts polled by Refinitiv.\n\nNet sales climbed to $5.40 billion from $5.28 billion one year ago, falling roughly in line with analysts' expectations for $5.41 billion. The company said digital sales were up a double-digit percentage, fueled by growth of sales made via mobile devices. Macy's is on track to reach $1 billion in mobile sales by the end of the year.\n\nSales at stores open for at least 12 months were up 3.3 percent, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth for Macy's, and surpassing Wall Street expectations for growth of 2.8 percent.\n\nLooking to the full year, Macy's is now calling for earnings per share to fall within a range of $4.10 to $4.30, up from $3.95 to $4.15. It also narrowed its forecast for same-stores sales to climb between 2.3 percent and 2.5 percent, compared with a prior range of 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent. Estimates for net sales narrowed to an expected increase of between 0.3 percent and 0.7 percent, compared with flat to up 0.7 percent, previously.\n\nHoping to avoid the same fate as now-bankrupt Sears, Macy's has been testing new technology and other concepts in stores to lure shoppers and grow sales.\n\nThe department store chain is adding mini marketplaces to some locations to sell goods from lesser-known and local brands. It's adding augmented reality devices to stores to let shoppers try on make-up virtually, along with virtual reality headsets to let shoppers see furniture in real life. All of Macy's stores are also expected to be equipped with mobile checkout by the end of the year.\n\nThe company, meanwhile, has been adding its off-price brand, Macy's Backstage, to existing full-line shops to compete with the likes of TJ Maxx, Nordstrom Rack and Ross Stores. Macy's has said stores with Backstage see two times more shopping trips, with basket sizes up an average of 30 percent.\n\nMacy's is also starting to experiment with smaller stores, hoping to trim staffing and inventory costs. Retailers including Kohl's, Nordstrom and Target have either opened smaller locations or trimmed larger ones in recent months, as more people shop online.\n\nAccording to Gennette, the company is making progress with its turnaround plans, and it's showing up in results. He said October was the strongest month for Macy's during the third quarter, particularly in the last three weeks. He added the company is \"ahead of schedule\" for hiring 80,000 workers this holiday season, despite many retailers facing headwinds amid a tight labor market in the U.S.\n\n\"While Macy's has been working to make improvements in its own business, we believe this performance sets an optimistic tone for the sector,\" Telsey Advisory Group analyst Dana Telsey said in a research note.\n\nOther retailers including Kohl's, Nordstrom and J.C.

Sales had not been as high since early 2015, just before the rule was being put in place.\n\nBut the rule effectively died in June, when the Trump administration declined to pursue a U.S. Supreme Court appeal that might have kept it alive. While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and state regulators are working on their own versions, consumer advocates say they do not expect investors to be as protected, particularly when high-fee annuities are involved.\n\n\"It still permits egregious products and egregious sales,\" said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, about the most recent draft of a National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) proposal.\n\nIn the most basic annuity, a customer gives a lump sum of cash to an insurer and receives a payment each month over a set number of years, sometimes for life.\n\nConsumers can benefit from that kind of steady income during retirement, but problems often arise with complex products, like fixed-indexed or variable annuities, Roper said. Investors often do not understand the risks and costs, which can be hidden in the fine print, she said.\n\nFees for complicated annuities can be 4 percent to 9 percent of the principal, industry sources said.\n\nThe SEC is working on an investor protection rule it calls \"Regulation Best Interest,\" while the NAIC plans to meet on Thursday in San Francisco to smooth out differences among state regulators for a proposed model rule that other states could later choose to adopt.\n\nNew York moved ahead of other states in June by issuing a regulation that requires insurance agents and brokers to act in consumers' best interest when selling annuities and life insurance. Although the New York State Department of Financial Services wants others to adopt the rule, which becomes effective in August 2019, the NAIC opposed some of the language.\n\nIowa Insurance Commissioner Doug Ommen expressed concern about using the term \"best interest\" because it could trigger litigation against insurers and agents, according to minutes of an August meeting.\n\nThe NAIC's most recent draft of the rule would require insurers and agents to \"act in the interests of the consumer\" without placing their own financial interests first. It would not require them to recommend the best-priced products.\n\nBirny Birnbaum, executive director of the Center of Economic Justice, said the draft does not go far enough. \"There is nothing in the proposal that forces the consumers' interest ahead of the insurers' interest,\" he said.", "Germany's economy just saw its worst quarter for several years, flash data showed on Wednesday morning, but with news of a draft Brexit deal and Italy refusing to budge on its controversial budget plans, you'd be forgiven for not noticing.\n\nInitial third-quarter growth data showed the Germany economy shrunk by 0.2 percent quarter-on-quarter, the first time it has contracted since the first quarter of 2015, according to Reuters.

While tight supply of homes for sale had been plaguing buyers for much of this year, listings are increasing, but so are prices and interest rates, weakening affordability.\n\nThe average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($453,100 or less) increased to 5.17 percent from 5.15 percent, with points increasing to 0.55 from 0.51 (including the origination fee) for loans with 20 percent down payments. That is the highest level since 2010.\n\nApplications to refinance a home loan, which are highly rate sensitive, fell 4.3 percent for the week and were 40 percent lower compared with a year ago --- the lowest level in nearly 18 years. While homeowners now have more collective home equity than they ever have in history, thanks to higher home values, fewer are willing to tap that equity through a refinance, because it would require giving up their rock-bottom interest rate. Since rates sat so low for so long, there is a shrinking pool of borrowers who could now benefit from a refinance, cash-out or not.\n\nMortgage rates have not moved so far this week, as the bond market, which rates follow, was closed Monday for the Veteran's Day holiday.

Cramer called Williams, who has also written 11 books, created numerous technical indicators and runs the website IReallyTrade.com, a \"chart master.\"\n\nWilliams saw two ways to make money as 2018 comes to a close. Both were in the retail sector, which tends to perform strongly in November and December as companies offer Black Friday, Cyber Monday and general holiday sales.\n\nFirst, Williams turned to Home Depot, the country's largest big-box home improvement chain. He suggested buying shares of Home Depot five trading days before Thanksgiving \u2014 this year, that falls on Thursday, Nov. 15 \u2014 and then holding it for 10 more trading days before exiting the position.\n\n\"Williams has back-tested this trade,\" Cramer said. \"If you did this using a stop-loss order $5 below where you bought Home Depot, how often would this strategy have made you money? Williams ran the numbers, [and] get this: over the past 33 years, his Home Depot trade would have been successful 33 times. Yep, it's worked every year since 1984.\"\n\nThe \"Mad Money\" host clarified that Williams was recommending a trade, not an investment. Even as the technician believes Home Depot is gearing up for a rally, if his trade doesn't work, Cramer suggested simply ringing the register early.\n\nAnother way to play the strength in retail, which Cramer said could also boost shares of Target, Costco and Amazon, would be by buying into the SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund, or the XRT, Williams suggested.\n\nHe noted that since the XRT was created 11 years ago, buying the ETF between two and five trading days before Thanksgiving and selling it 10 days later has given investors a healthy gain every single year.\n\nLike for Home Depot, Williams said this Thursday would be the best moment for investors to pounce and suggested using a $5 stop order to protect against potential downside.\n\nAll in all, \"the charts, as interpreted by the legendary Larry Williams, suggest that Home Depot and [the] XRT would make terrific trades if you buy them on Thursday and sell them 10 days later,\" Cramer said. \"I think he's got a point, as this tends to be a good time of the year for retail, regardless of what else is going on in the market.\"", "Oil prices could 'potentially' move lower again: ClipperData\n\n6:19 PM ET Tue, 13 Nov 2018\n\nIncreasing oil production in the U.S. has aided in \"greasing the wheels\" for the sell-off in the market, says Matt Smith of ClipperData.", "The Federal Reserve needs to take note of the economic forces already weighing on the U.S. economy before it plans more rate hikes for 2019, CNBC's Jim Cramer argued after yet another wild trading session on Wall Street.\n\n\"It's important to recognize that the most important inputs ... for future inflation are already going lower, not higher. It'd be crazy to ignore that,\" he said Tuesday. \"While I think [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell's been mistaken in his approach, he's not crazy. The man is prudent \u2014 there's no reason for him to be rash, especially not with the deflationary impact of the strong dollar helping him.\"\n\nAs the strong dollar squeezes global companies' profits because overseas currencies are translated into fewer dollars, higher interest rates are crimping domestic demand for real estate, Cramer warned on \"Mad Money.\"\n\n\"We've seen steady deceleration in real estate and construction projects at a host of banks. American Electric Power, ... the biggest utility in the country, talked about a downtick in activity,\" he said. \"We know that housing starts and housing sales are just abysmal. And while Home Depot assured us of stronger sales, it acknowledged that housing is slowing.\"\n\nWorse, U.S. crude oil prices just reached a one-year low after 12 consecutive days of declines, and prices of basic economic building blocks including lumber, copper, chemicals and paper are falling, the \"Mad Money\" host noted.\n\n\"The action, to me, screams 'slowdown,'\" he said. \"Yes, we still have wage inflation, I know. People are making a little more money.

Even with all its data-privacy scandals, Facebook's advertising power and Instagram business are keeping the company afloat heading into 2019, he said.\n\n\"Facebook is one grown-up appointment away from having a stock that can go higher. Just one. They simply need to hire an outside adult at the C-suite level ... who won't tolerate any nonsense, and you know what'll happen? The stock will soar,\" he said. \"You don't have to like this company to realize that it remains the best way to reach younger consumers.\"\n\nAmazon is \"on the verge of having the biggest holiday season ever,\" he added. Netflix, which Cramer admitted has an expensive stock, still has the power to raise prices, create tiers of content and land high-profile deals, he said. Alphabet is the current leader in the self-driving car space with its Waymo division and has over $100 billion in cash.\n\n\"The bottom line? Do not be so quick to write off Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet [and] Apple,\" Cramer said. \"The Fab Five may be out of favor right now ... but there's a lot they could do to make a comeback. I know to bet against them right here, after this decline, ... seems maybe ill-advised. In fact, it might be right to actually start \u2014 yes, I'm going to whisper \u2014 buying them.\"", "Final Trades: JPM, DNKN & more\n\n6:09 PM ET Tue, 13 Nov 2018\n\nThe \"Fast Money\" traders share their final trades of the day, including JP Morgan, Dunkin, Alibaba and Cleveland Cliffs.", "Expect softness in US home prices, says analyst\n\n5:55 PM ET Tue, 13 Nov 2018\n\nBrandon Fletcher of Bernstein says there's a possibility of an overall \"disconnect\" between house prices and home improvement spending.", "Technician says investors shouldn't fear a death cross in small caps\n\n5:53 PM ET Tue, 13 Nov 2018\n\nAre small caps a big problem?

Weisman said 2017 was the first year in history in which consumers under 35 years old drank more espresso beverages than hot drip coffee, which ultimately pushed Dunkin' in to reevaluating its espresso.\n\nResearch shows that more than 50 percent of millennials are opting for espresso beverages when they order coffee, the first generation to do so, said Dan Wheeler, vice president of strategic initiatives.\n\n\"Espresso skews younger \u2014 I graduated from pop and soda to drip coffee, but my kids are graduating from Coolattas to lattes,\" Dunkin' CEO Dave Hoffmann told reporters Tuesday.\n\nAs the brand pushes out from its stronghold in the Northeast, there's demand for more specialty drinks. The company has said that 90 percent of its next 1,000 stores will be west of the Mississippi.\n\nHoffmann said he's hoping the combination of good flavor, cheap prices and fast service will be enough to lure \u2014 not only existing customers to try its espresso \u2014 but customers at other cafes.\n\nThe company created a new recipe for its espresso, increasing the amount of coffee used and decreasing the amount of water. The new shot is thicker, richer and less bitter than the old espresso, which launched in 2003 and was made with more water and brewed at a higher temperature.\n\nThis new espresso gives Dunkin's beverages a more premium taste, but it won't come at a premium cost, executives said.\n\nDunkin' will roll out its new espresso drinks at $2 during its initial promotion before rising to $3.39 for a medium drink, compared with $5 or $6 at Starbucks.\n\nIn addition to iced and hot espresso beverages, the company will also sell affogato, an Italian-style dessert in which a shot of hot espresso is poured over a scoop of ice cream, at locations that are both a Baskin Robbins and a Dunkin'.\n\nSo far, the company hasn't seen any cannibalization of its other beverages in offering these espresso drinks, executives said.\n\n\"We're going after market share,\" Parag Patel, a Dunkin' franchisee that owns 30 locations in California and Maryland. \"But, we are not just trading consumers from hot or iced coffee, we are targeting different consumers and different day parts.\"\n\nPatel, who was the franchisee that ran Dunkin's espresso test in Baltimore over the summer, said his stores sold a lot of espresso later in the day. Afternoon traffic is something that many restaurants have tried to cultivated with value offerings and new menu items. It is seen as an undervalued time of the day with the potential for boosting sales.\n\nPatel also said that close to 90 percent of customers who tried the new espresso said they would return to buy it again.\n\nAnd if the price isn't enticing enough, Dunkin' is promising to deliver its espresso beverages to consumers faster than its competitors.\n\n\"Dunkin' is a place to take five [minutes], not 50,\" Wheeler said to reporters.\n\nExecutives said they are rearranging and updating kitchen equipment so employees can make the new beverages fast.\n\n\"We may aspire to sit around and sip lattes,\" Meredith Morris, senior manager of consumer insights, said, alluding to rival Starbucks' reputation for being a destination location for coffee drinkers. \"But espresso gives you energy while you are on the run. We have busy lifestyles.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, second-generation franchisees Victor and Octavio Carvalho, who own the first Dunkin' Donuts location as well as the first Next Gen store, praised the company's collaborative efforts and said the financial commitment they had to make to revamp the espresso was \"the right thing to do.\"\n\n\"This is where it's heading,\" Octavio said. \"That's what people enjoy drinking.\"\n\n\"The commitment is worth it in the long run,\" Victor added.\n\nWATCH: Why Dunkin' is failing in India", "Tilray CEO: Our biggest challenge is that there's so much demand for product 4:34 PM ET Tue, 13 Nov 2018 | 03:01\n\n\"All of that revenue for this quarter is medical and we look forward to next quarter, when we'll start to see some Canadian adult-use revenue in that earnings report,\" Kennedy said.\n\n\"The biggest challenge is that there's just so much demand, which is interesting to see,\" he added. \"It definitely takes six to 12 months for supply and demand to reach some sort of equilibrium.\"\n\nThe pressure is on for Tilray to offer shareholders a reason for optimism as well as justify its steep valuation.\n\nTilray's stock has climbed more than 320 percent over the past three months, making it one of the most speculative names on the Street.

Trump had repeatedly criticized Sessions for recusing himself in March 2017 from the federal investigation, now headed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, into Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election, a probe Trump has called a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nDemocrats in Congress have voiced concern that Whitaker, a Trump loyalist, could undermine or even fire Mueller.\n\nMaryland asked U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander to bar Whitaker from appearing in an official capacity as acting attorney general in existing litigation related to the Affordable Care Act healthcare law and to substitute Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in Whitaker's place.\n\nWith Whitaker's appointment, Rosenstein is no longer in charge of the investigation.\n\nThe city of San Francisco, also involved in litigation against the Trump administration, on Monday also told the Justice Department it may sue to challenge Whitaker's appointment.\n\nWhitaker's appointment as the top U.S. law enforcement official gives him authority over Mueller's investigation, which already has led to criminal charges against a series of former Trump aides and has cast a cloud over his presidency. Whitaker, who had served as chief of staff for Sessions, previously questioned the scope of Mueller's investigation and spoke about the idea of reducing funding for the special counsel so the probe \"grinds to almost a halt.\"\n\nMaryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, a Democrat, said in a statement the state plans to challenge Whitaker's appointment on two legal grounds.\n\nMaryland argues that Rosenstein, the department's No. 2 official, should have succeeded Sessions under an existing federal succession law that vests full authority in the deputy attorney general should the office of attorney general become vacant. The state also argues that Trump violated the so-called Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution because the job of attorney general is a \"principal officer\" who must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.", "Who really won the midterms? Why both parties can claim victories 3:59 PM ET Fri, 9 Nov 2018 | 04:41\n\nAll those demographic trends expand the pool of Democratic-leaning voters. But they've been offset in recent midterm elections by low rates of voting among specific Democratic constituencies, most notably young voters and Latinos.\n\nThat's where the second current \u2014 Democratic mobilization \u2014 made a difference. In small but consistent ways, the party's campaigns altered turnout patterns in their favor.\n\nExit polls provide one basic measure. In 2010 and 2014, about the same number of Democrats and Republicans showed up to vote. This year, Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 4 percentage points.\n\nThe Democratic data firm Catalist, in a preliminary analysis of precinct, county and congressional district election results, adds more detail. It found the share of white voters dropped by 3 percentage points, from 79 percent to 76 percent, while the share of blacks, Latinos and Asian-Americans rose by 1 point apiece.\n\nSimilarly, the share of voters ages 18-24 and 25-29 each edged up by 1 percentage point; the share ages 30-39 ticked up 2 percentage points. The proportion of single voters and voters with college degrees swelled by 3 percentage points apiece.\n\nNon-college-educated white men, the most Republican demographic group, dropped to 22 percent of the electorate from 25 percent in 2014; college-educated women of all races edged by two points. Rural voters fell by three points to 26 percent overall.\n\nThose shifts occurred as turnout surged across the board. An estimated 49 percent of eligible voters cast ballots, up from 37 percent four years ago. Turnout of voters under 30, Tufts University researchers estimate, climbed to 31 percent from 21 percent in 2014.\n\nMoreover, Democrats benefited from better-targeted turnout boosts. \"They were more energized than Republicans in competitive races, but less so in targeted ones where their voters weren't as needed,\" says GOP pollster Patrick Ruffini.\n\nThe Trump factor powered Democratic mobilization and built on it. Alarm over Trump's policies and behavior propelled superior Democratic fundraising, which paid for late ads and turnout efforts.\n\nAt the same time, reaction to Trump made the Democratic-leaning constituencies that party strategists turned out even more Democratic-leaning than before. Thus exit polls showed that voters under 30, who backed Democrats by 11 percentage points in 2014, backed them by 35 points this time.", "DeepMind, the Alphabet subsidiary focused on health and AI, announced in a company blog post on Tuesday that its health group will be absorbed by Google. That news comes just days after Google disclosed plans to form a new, centralized health unit at its Silicon Valley, California headquarters led by David Feinberg, a physician and former hospital executive.\n\nAs part of the move, Google will now manage the Streams app that DeepMind created. Streams is a tool to help doctors and nurses figure out which of their patients are at increased risk for acute kidney injury. It does that by analyzing patient information and sending an alert to a clinician's phone to let them know that they're urgently needed.\n\nThe move concerns some privacy advocates, as DeepMind had previously promised not to share data with its parent company.\n\n\"Data collected by DeepMind Health will never be connected to Google accounts or services,\" the company said in a previous statement, which some privacy advocates are recirculating on Twitter:\n\nJulia Powles, a research fellow at NYU Law, tweeted \"DeepMind repeatedly, unconditionally promised to never connect people's intimate, identifiable health data to Google. This isn't transparency, it's trust demolition.\"\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, DeepMind stressed that it still won't be sharing health information with Google.\n\nA spokesperson said that DeepMind's work with the NHS will not be impacted. \"We're fully committed to all our NHS partners, and to delivering on our current projects and more,\" they said. Under Google Health, the team will continue to work closely with the NHS and \"information governance and safety remain our top priorities,\" the person explained.\n\nDeepMind also reiterated that patient data would remain under the control of these partners. They also said that the data will continue to be subject to \"strict audit and access controls and its processing remains subject to both our contracts and data protection legislation.\"\n\nUltimately, they said, \"the move to Google does not affect this.\"\n\nDeepMind has been criticized in the past for how its approach to managing health data. In particular, privacy advocates have raised concerns about the issue of consent and whether DeepMind should have asked patients for access to their clinical data.\n\nThese questions came up as the company began to work with doctors and nurses to get its Streams app into U.K. hospitals.\n\nTo bolster transparency in response to these concerns, DeepMind held regular patient forums in its native U.K. and set up an independent review panel of British physicians, academics and policymakers. That panel could now be disbanded, although no final decision has been made, according to a person familiar with the situation.\n\nPowles, the technology law researcher, remains unconvinced.\n\n\"There is nothing more precious and intimate than our personal health information,\" she said, referring to DeepMind's statement as a \"diversionary\" tactic. \"At what point do we say enough is enough?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "The company said its self-serve business accounted for 88 percent of sales during the quarter, but a sales-assisted segment is quickly scaling.\n\n\"We're still early in the development and expansion of our sales-assisted strategy and we saw great traction with our sales efforts during the quarter, signing agreements with companies such as LinkedIn, Nasdaq, Sky and Intercom,\" the company said in its shareholder letter. \"By selling SurveyMonkey to the enterprise, we expect to accelerate paying user growth and increase both monetization and retention within organizations.\"\n\nEnterprise clients likely account for the company's rising average revenue per user.

The company said the higher losses were largely related to changes in stock-based compensation now that it's public.\n\nSurveyMonkey revealed in its IPO filing that its losses are growing faster than revenue on a percentage basis. The company reported a negative operating margin of 145 percent in the third quarter, compared with a negative operating margin of 11 percent a year earlier.\n\nSurveyMonkey shares dropped last month when its larger and faster-growing rival Qualtrics filed to go public.

A move below it is sometimes seen as a sign of a trend change. In the case of the S&P 500, the 200-day is 2,762, and the S&P continued to trade below it on Tuesday.\n\nBespoke said historically the S&P has been positive both one week later and one year after falling below a downward sloping 200-day moving average. But gains in the year later averaged a small 1.7 percent, compared with an average S&P 500 return for all years of closer to 8 percent.\n\nBut the S&P's performance was choppy after falling below the 200-day. Its performance was negative on average a month later, three months later and also six months later, according to Bespoke.\n\nOn Tuesday, the S&P hit a high of 2,754 but failed to move back up toward the moving average, which now could be a zone of resistance for the market. \"Instead of buying dips, investors are selling rallies,\" Redler said.\n\nSource: Bespoke\n\nTech has also been tested. Apple, for instance, fell below its 200-day moving average Tuesday morning and struggled to hold above the $193.37 level all day. But Apple failed and closed below it, losing 1 percent to $192.23.\n\n\"We'll see in the next day or two if the 200-day can be reclaimed or not. If not it'll be an indicator that demand isn't there, and it will give us clues of lower prices to come, later this week or early next week. The next big support is closer to $180,\" said Redler.\n\n\"If they're not buying Apple, which is growth and value, they're not going to be in a rush to buy anything higher,\" said Redler.\n\nApple's ability to regain the moving average is also seen as a test for other tech names and even the broader market, since it is so widely held. Other tech and momentum names, such as Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, also broke or are challenging their 200-day moving averages.\n\n\"At the sector level, Technology's weakness remains consistent with market leadership breaking in the late stages of a broader correction. Despite Monday's weakness, and as noted here last week, many bellwether names are holding/testing key support levels defined by rising 200-dma's. We expect the recent lows to hold and support rebounds into year-end,\" writes Robert Sluymer, Fundstrat technical analyst.\n\nHow the market resolves these chart patterns could decide how stocks trade into the end of the year.

This government setup makes it harder for the government to move significantly forward on a number of issues. However, leaders from both parties have signaled they are willing to work together on infrastructure, opening the door for a bipartisan bill to move forward in Washington.\n\n\"This is a logical time to address the many US infrastructure deficiencies that have become an impediment to a variety of economic activities in the US, most notably transportation,\" Darby, the bank's chief global equity strategist, wrote on Monday. \"Public spending on infrastructure (transportation and water) as a share of GDP is near all-time lows (2.3%). Higher infrastructure spending would help US competitiveness and the associated jobs created would also help the economy.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week he and Democratic House Rep. Nancy Pelosi talked about bipartisan cooperation on infrastructure. On Tuesday, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said the Trump administration is looking into a multifaceted infrastructure plan that would improve the U.S. shipping industry and energy pipelines.\n\nThe S&P 500 materials sector, which includes Nucor and Vulcan Materials, traded more than 0.6 percent higher following Kudlow's comments. The industrials sector, which is also made up of several infrastructure-related companies, rose 1 percent on Tuesday.\n\nDarby included Nucor and Vulcan in Jefferies' \"Shifting Sands\" basket, which tracks infrastructure stocks. The basket also includes Reliance Steel, United Rentals and Commercial Metals, among others. These stocks have underperformed the broader market in 2018.

It's enormous. So big that you could fit 33 football fields \u2014 and it's only getting larger.\n\n\"The Gigafactory is critical to Tesla. There is more batteries produced here for electric vehicles than in the rest of the planet combined.

This year, the automaker is on track to sell 236,000 vehicles. Much of that growth is due to its latest vehicle, the Model 3, a sedan targeted to a broader audience than Tesla's previous cars. All of the Model 3's batteries are built at the Gigafactory.\n\nLast quarter, as Tesla hit its target of producing more than 5,000 Model 3 cars per week, the company posted a profit.

To be eligible, applicants must provide proof of employment, be 18 or older, work for a business that's based out of Tulsa County, and pledge to move to and live in Tulsa for a minimum of one year.\n\nParticipants can live in the City of Tulsa or in the county. Those who live in the county must work out of the co-working space the program has provided. The program will start with small groups of around 10 to 15 people at a time, Levit says. Eventually, he adds, the city hopes to have up to 300 remote workers in the program.\n\nTulsa joins a growing list of U.S. cities looking to attract young professionals, a list that includes: Baltimore, Maryland; St. Clair County, Michigan; and Marquette, Kansas.\n\nSimilarly, Vermont signed a bill into law last May that will pay workers $10,000 to move to the state and work remotely for an out-of-state employer.\n\n\"Remote workers have an economy already that they'll be bringing with them,\" says Levit. \"We want to target folks who show promise.\"\n\nLike this story?

A month ago, traders were concerned that a looming shortage of oil would push crude futures to $100 a barrel. Now, supply is expected to swamp demand at the start of 2019.\n\nAs a result, oil prices have plunged more than $20 a barrel since the start of October, when Brent crude rose to nearly $87 a barrel and U.S. crude traded just shy of $77. Both benchmarks are now trading firmly in bear market territory, having fallen more than 20 percent from their 52-week highs.\n\nAlong the way, U.S. crude has posted its longest losing streak since it began trading in New York more than three decades ago. The contract has now fallen for 12 consecutive sessions. It settled at $55.69 on Tuesday, its lowest closing price since Nov. 16, 2017.\n\nThe roots of the pullback can be traced back to the most recent rally itself. At the peak of the run-up, many energy analysts said oil prices never should have risen so far so fast.\n\nCrude futures rose to four-year highs on Oct. 3 as the market braced for renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran, OPEC's third biggest producer. Through September, the threat of sanctions wiped about 800,000 barrels a day off the market, fueling speculation that some oil importers would struggle to find supplies.", "FAO Schwarz is coming back to NYC, here's what to expect 8:40 AM ET Tue, 13 Nov 2018 | 04:35\n\nFAO Schwarz returns to the Big Apple this week, three years after closing its landmark Fifth Avenue store, offering holiday shoppers an experience they can't get online, including a new twist on the big floor piano that Tom Hanks danced on in the movie \"Big.\"\n\nCreating a bigger-than-life, \"experiential\" feel at physical stores is \"probably the biggest buzzword in retail,\" said David Conn, CEO of ThreeSixty Brands, whose parent company, ThreeSixty Group, bought FAO Schwarz in 2016.\n\n\"We joke that we have a brand that is 150 years old and was 'experiential' before it was cool,\" Conn told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday.

And therefore, we can charge somewhat of a premium for those.\"\n\nThreeSixty Group, whose portfolio also includes Sharper Image and Discovery Kids, purchased FAO Schwarz for an undisclosed amount about two years ago from struggling Toys \"R\" Us, which closed the Fifth Avenue location in 2015.\n\nHowever, some of the old favorites are coming over to the new flagship store, including a version of the colossal clock tower.\n\n\"And of course, it's FAO Schwarz, so we have the big dance-on piano. But this time, not just on the floor, it's also on the ceiling above,\" Conn added. \"We wanted the people who are standing in the plaza to see people dance and see the keys lighting up.\"\n\nThe new FAO Schwarz also plans to set up a permanent presence in Canada and China and open pop-up shops in Spain, Australia and London.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Lauren Thomas contributed to this report.", "The European Union and Britain have agreed to a draft text of a Brexit withdrawal agreement and Prime Minister Theresa May will present it to her senior ministers on Wednesday, after more than a year of tortuous negotiations.\n\nWhile officials choreograph the first withdrawal of a sovereign state from the EU, it remains unclear whether May can get any deal approved by the British parliament as hardline Brexiteers said she had surrendered to Brussels.\n\n\"Cabinet will meet at 2 p.m. (1400 GMT) tomorrow to consider the draft agreement the negotiating teams have reached in Brussels, and to decide on next steps,\" a spokesman at May's Downing Street office said.\n\n\"Cabinet ministers have been invited to read documentation ahead of that meeting,\" the spokesman said, after Irish and British media were leaked details of the breakthrough.\n\nA senior EU official confirmed that a draft text had been agreed upon.

Equity funds caused the biggest damage, down 4.3 percent, while derivatives fell 3.7 percent and broad multimarket managers saw a decline of close to 2.5 percent.\n\nThe only class to make money was foreign exchange/currency, which rose just over 1 percent.\n\nThe declines dragged funds into negative territory for the year, with a loss of 2.6 percent.\n\n\"The search for bright spots in the industry was difficult in October as almost every hedge fund primary market and primary strategy was in the red for the month, although many are still in positive territory\" year to date, eVestment said in a report. \"October's fund performance and resulting impact on YTD performance are in stark contrast to the largely positive results hedge funds saw in 2017 and 2016.\"\n\nIndeed, the industry has been on a winning streak, with returns of about 9 percent in 2017 and 5.8 percent the year before.\n\nBad as October was, hedge funds actually outperformed the stock market, as the S&P 500 fell 6.9 percent. The market's losses began in mid-October, when investors began worrying about higher interest rates, corporate earnings that may be close to peaking, and the looming midterms that ultimately saw Democrats wrest House control from the Republicans.\n\nFor the year, though, equities continue to hold the edge. Investors who bought a plain index fund that tracks the S&P 500 would have been up about 3 percent through October and paid only a low fee, while the hedge fund industry, much of which still operates on the 2-and-20 model \u2014 respectively representing the percentage charge on assets and performance \u2014 lagged behind.\n\nFrom a strategy standpoint, multistrategy credit led in October by being about flat, while event-driven activists lost 5.8 percent. For the year, multistrategy has been the best performer, with a 2.9 percent return, while activists have fared worst with a 6.9 percent decline.\n\nThe 10 largest funds have done best with a collective gain of 1.24 percent year to date, while the 10 largest managed futures funds are down 4.9 percent.

(In 2019, the threshold will rise to $125,000.) That HCE designation also automatically applies if you owned more than 5 percent of the business at any time in that preceding year.\n\nFurther, employers can elect to consider you a highly compensated employee if your pay puts you among the top 20 percent of employees.\n\nBecoming an HCE, however, can require extra planning at open enrollment.\n\nHighly compensated workers are often subject to reduced contribution limits or access to certain pre-tax benefits \u2014 notably, 401(k) plans and dependent care flexible spending accounts. They may also have an opportunity during open enrollment to sign up for something called a deferred compensation arrangement, whereby the company holds a portion of their salary to be paid out at a later date.\n\n\"Don't just assume your open enrollment choices are the same as last year,\" said certified financial planner Carolyn McClanahan, director of financial planning for Life Planning Partners in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nMore from Personal Finance:\n\nAvoid making these three bad assumptions during Medicare open enrollment\n\nInvestors welcome rising interest rates, despite Trump's resistance\n\nEmployment scams are on the rise in tight labor market\n\nRestrictions on highly compensated workers stem from so-called non-discrimination tests, which the IRS requires retirement plans and certain benefit offerings to pass every year to maintain their tax advantages. Broadly speaking, the tests compare how HCEs and non-HCEs are making use of those programs, to ensure the highly paid workers aren't disproportionately benefiting, said Nicole Wruck, national health leader at benefits administrator Alight.\n\n\"The burden is on the plan sponsor to make sure they pass those IRS tests,\" she said.\n\nRoughly 15 percent to 20 percent of companies curb highly compensated employees' 401(k) contributions in some way to keep their plans from failing those nondiscrimination tests, said Rob Austin, head of research for Alight.\n\n\"What is kind of an interesting angle is, these people who are newly highly compensated,\" he said. \"Crossing over the threshold, it can be jarring to see the percentage of pay you can contribute drop.\"\n\nHow companies handle that cutoff varies. Some plans cap highly paid workers' contributions either upfront or at some point during the year, Austin said. About 12 percent return excess pre-tax contributions to workers as taxable pay after the plan year ends, according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America's annual survey of profit sharing and 401(k) plans.", "WHEN: Today, Tuesday, November 13, 2018\n\nWHERE: CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\"\n\nThe following is the unofficial transcript of a CNBC interview with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow and CNBC's David Faber on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" (M-F 9AM \u2013 11AM) today, Tuesday, November 13th. The following is a link to video from the interview on CNBC.com: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/11/13/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-white-house-advisor-larry-kudlow.html.\n\nAll references must be sourced to CNBC.\n\nDAVID FABER: Stocks are near session lows, extending that selloff from yesterday. President Trump yesterday, as well, blaming the sharp downturn on the, quote, \"Prospect of presidential harassment,\" by the incoming democratically controlled house of representatives. Joining us now, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow. Larry, always good to see you, though I have to admit, I miss not having you to my right here on set.\n\nLARRY KUDLOW: Thank you.\n\nFABER: Where I can at least try to reach out and touch you. Stop you, sometimes, from talking.\n\nKUDLOW: I appreciate it very much.\n\nFABER: Larry, you know, trade -- it continues to be one of the big issues and certainly one we discuss with you. This morning I'm looking at a Strategas piece out, says \"Is the Kudlow trade framework crumbling?\" Maybe you've seen it.\n\nKUDLOW: I saw that.\n\nFABER: Give me your take.\n\nKUDLOW: I saw the headline from my pal, Dan Clifton. I didn't actually read the piece. Let me just guess. I'll lay out a framework for you, and you can go where every you want to go. First of all, we are again talking with China and I think that's very, very, very positive. The President initiated a phone call with President Xi. We now know that we will in fact discuss trade at the G20 meeting in Argentina. We didn't know that before but as a certainty, but there will be many things, security matters and so forth on that list, but trade is going to be one of them. Right now, we're having communications at all levels of U.S. and Chinese government. I spoke to Secretary Mnuchin this morning about that, as part of our preparation for the G20. So without even thinking about a prediction on the outcome, we are talking to them again. You know me. I think it's better to talk than not talk, so, that's a plus. We're in very good negotiations with the European Union. We're in very good negotiations with Japan. We did get the U.S./Mexican/Canadian \u2013 the NCA. So I think, you know, we're moving ahead on trade discussions and we had a very good deal in North America, so I think it's a pretty good story, to tell you the truth.\n\nFABER: Yeah. You know, Larry, the piece that I reference, we referenced at the top, it actually is trying to paint a more positive prospect for an agreement. But it's saying that because it's starting to -- they're starting to say they see signs, Dan Clifton, of slowness coming in the economy as a result of the dispute. Investment slowdown in the third quarter, they say, is a major red flag that tariffs are starting to impact CAPEX. Are you seeing that and are you concerned about it?\n\nKUDLOW: No. Not really. I mean, I agree that the capex numbers were a little soft in Q3. They had been very strong in the prior quarters. And actually, David, there may be some glitches in those numbers. Kevin Hasset, my colleague at CEA, the durable biz reports really look better than we saw in the GDP, we may get a revision upward, maybe next quarter. I think that's still a strong area. Look, the tariffs that we impose on china, because of their recalcitrant -- they won't seem to respond positively to our asks. Maybe that's going to change in the next month, I don't know. Those tariffs haven't really hit yet. They're not in place. I think some of these companies are worried. I understand that. Nonetheless we're doing what we must do with respect to China. In my judgment, I piece deal in transfer of technology, forced transfer ownership, high tariffs on a number of commodities, cyber hacking. We can't let that happen. So I think the president is doing the right thing. But \u2013\n\nFABER: Right, But \u2013\n\nKUDLOW: But, but, but my point to Dan Clifton who I have spoken to this morning is we are resuming talks with china. It will be part of the G20. And I have to believe that's a good thing. And we are talking to the EU and Japan, and we did get the USMCA done. So that's not bad.\n\nFABER: No. Larry, I think, Peter Navarro had some things to say recently in terms of when you term Wall Street bankers and the like, trying to get their influence felt by the white house. I think we have it. I would love for you to listen to his comments and respond to them, if you can.\n\nPETER NAVARRO: If there is a deal, if and when there is a deal, it will be on President Donald J. Trump's terms, not Wall Street terms. But if Wall Street is involved and continues to insinuate itself into these negotiations, there will be a stench, a stench around any deal that's consummated, because it will have the imprimatur of Goldman Sachs and Wall Street. So I would urge these unpaid foreign agents to stand down on this issue.\n\nFABER: Would you similarly urge Wall Street to stand down, Larry?\n\nKUDLOW: I would not. Look, Peter Navarro is a friend of mine, truly. We've known each other for 20 years, but he was not speaking for the president, nor was he speaking for the administration. His remarks were way off base. They were not authorized by anybody. I actually think he did the president a great disservice. Look, the president can talk to whomever he can talk to. He talks to people on Wall Street, yes. He talks to union leaders. I've been in some of those meetings. Yes. He talks to other outside advisers. He has every right to do so. And the president has said, and I've reflected this on your network and elsewhere, that if there is a deal to be had with China, it's a deal that has to be in American interests along the asks that I just mentioned on technology and so forth. That's got to happen. So I think Peter very badly misspoke. He was freelancing and he's not representing the president or the administration.\n\nMorgan Brennan: Larry, this is Morgan Brennan. I need to get your thoughts on the dollar, because it's really bucked expectations. We saw at the beginning of the year, strengthening pretty notably this year. On the one hand strong dollar tied with strong economy, on the other hand you're trying to increase U.S. exports and strike some of these trade deals, encourage U.S. companies to create more jobs at home. It's a headwind. How is the strong dollar being, I guess, discussed and is it being involved in shaping policy right now?\n\nKUDLOW: Well, look, the dollar, currency matters are the purview of the treasury department I Will only comment lightly that the dollar today, which is King Dollar, we have the best economy in the world. Investment is flowing here. I regard that as a good thing. I know it goes up and down. Basically if you go back and run a chart 18 or 20 years, actually, the dollar is sort of right at the midpoint of that long chart. Up, down, up, down. In fact, in recent years, the dollar has been pretty steady, in my judgment. It is on an upswing right now. By the way, one of the benefits of a steady dollar, steady, is a lower inflation rate. And one of the issues I've not heard enough discussion is disinflation. In the last nine months, the PCE \u2013 deflator, which the fed watches, has actually fallen from about 2.7 to 1.4%. That's a terrific thing. That's supply side tax cuts. We're increasing the potential of the economy to grow. When you create more, prices can come down. There was an inflation scare a little while ago. It's going away. I think this is a big plus. Inflation is the cruelest tax of all and I think it's going to give a lot of relief. And it's like a tax cut for the economy. So I like that. And the rest of the dollar story, I'll leave to Mr. Mnuchin. Right now, King dollar, we're attracting money all over the world. We're the hottest economy. We're crushing it right now. China is in a slump. The EU is slumping. So, they're coming to where the returns are best and the most hospitable environment.\n\nMICHAEL SANTOLI: Larry, with the democratic control of the house right now, obviously, a lot of the talk is stalled about feasible tax cut 2.0, things like that. What is the economic agenda on a going forward basis that's actually practically possible?\n\nKUDLOW: Well, look, the president has said that he is more than willing to discuss, negotiate, talk to Ms. Pelosi, if she becomes the speaker and so forth. He is willing to reach across the aisle. On the other hand, if they're more belligerent, he will fight back. He was clear about that in the press conference last week regarding our policy goals, we will be looking at additional tax reform, 2.0 if you will. There are other things we are noodling inside the administration, we're working with the house and the senate. The senate by the way is a very powerful body, so they're not going to let our tax cuts and deregulation and energy reform be overturned. And if they were, the president would veto it. So I don't want to get ahead of the story. We're going to have a tough budget, as you know, 5% reduction for the domestic nonentitlements. I think that's healthy for the economy. We're looking at infrastructure in many different ways. You know, the President, former construction man, real estate man. Infrastructure, I \u2013 particularly, we are working on at the National Economic Council, the NEC, I'd like to do energy infrastructure. I'd like to do pipelines. I'd like to do anything that will help LNG, terminals, shipping. We'd like to revise the U.S. shipping industry which has been dormant many years. We would like to export oil, Nat Gas, LNG, to Europe and to Asia. Those are very important issues\u2014\n\nFABER: Which we do.\n\nKUDLOW: -- they want LNG. They want it badly.\n\nFABER: Right.\n\nKUDLOW: And we're going to do whatever we can to accommodate.\n\nFABER: Larry, final question here. I want you to indulge me, I want you to take us back a year or so when you and I would typically be talking before you'd be coming on, and you'd say \"What's going on this morning?\" And I would say to you this morning if we were having that conversation, \"Well, the market is worried Powell's going to keep tighten to at least neutral. People are worried we are going to 25% on these tariffs on China. Earnings were pretty good, but guidance wasn't quite as good. And people seem to be more scared in the market right now.\" Your response would be, if we were having that conversation, what?\n\nKUDLOW: I would say corrections come and go. I mean, it's been a long bull market. We are way ahead of where we were in late 2016 after the president's election. The market has done very well. We've had these corrections. We had one last winter as you know. We're going through one now. I believe at least at close of business yesterday, the overall correction was 7%. I don't like that. I don't want anybody to ever lose money in their 401(k), but historically, as you know, that's a rather mild correction. So I think the economy is very healthy. I mean I think profits are strong. We had a tremendous NFIB Small Business Confidence number today, you had a good consumer sentiment number, profits continue to rise. The ISMs are very strong. I mean, I think this is a very healthy economy. The story here in my view, everybody said we couldn't get 3% plus growth, we're getting get 3% plus growth.

Juul is also banning sales to anyone under 21, even in states where the legal age is lower. Additionally, Burns said the company will more intensely police individual retailers by increasing its secret shopper visits from 500 to about 2,000 per month.\n\nThe new policy doesn't go as far as expected. A person briefed on the company's plan told CNBC last week that Juul would stop all retail sales of flavored pods. There was no mention of resuming sales at any point. It's unclear when sales could resume.\n\nBurns also said the company won't sell flavored pods to retailers that aren't legally allowed to sell them to the public, leaving the door open if federal regulators follow through on plans to restrict those sales to vape shops.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration this week plans to restrict sales of cartridge-based flavored e-cigarettes to places such as vape and tobacco shops, senior administration officials have told CNBC.\n\nRetailers that want to sell the sweeter flavors will need to comply with Juul's new distribution system and age restrictions. Clerks must electronically scan IDs and verify consumers are older than 21, regardless of local laws. The sale quantity will also be limited to prevent bulk purchases.\n\nThe company is also curbing some of its marketing practices, Burns said. Juul will shut down its Facebook and Instagram accounts and end promotional activity on Twitter, using it only for \"non-promotional\" communications, Burns said. The company has never used Snapchat. It will also use its YouTube account only to show former adult smokers' testimonials. Juul already works with Instagram and Facebook to scrape inappropriate content, including images and videos of teenagers using its products.\n\nFood and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb in a tweet said \"voluntary action is no substitute for regulatory steps\" the agency will soon take, but he wants to recognize Juul's actions and encourage others to take actions to reverse youth use.\n\nJuul is already dominating the e-cigarette industry, just three years since its popular nicotine pods hit the market. The company, valued at $16 billion, captured 75 percent of the market in the period ended Nov. 3, according to Nielsen data compiled by Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog.\n\nBut the e-cigarette's appeal among teenagers has undermined Juul's success and threatened its future.\n\nAfter months of parents and lawmakers begging the FDA to do something, Gottlieb in September ordered Juul and four other e-cigarette makers to fix what he labeled \"epidemic\" levels of teens using e-cigarettes. He said preliminary federal data show a more than 75 percent surge in high school students regularly using e-cigarettes.\n\nThat means roughly 3 million, or about 20 percent of high school kids, are using e-cigarettes, up from 1.73 million, or 11.7 percent in last year's National Youth Tobacco Survey. The complete data set is expected to be published this month.\n\n\"We're in alignment with [Gottlieb] that we need to take action and we need to get this category in a better position,\" Burns told CNBC in an October interview. The company declined to make Burns available for an interview Tuesday.\n\nThis week, the FDA will release its own proposal, which includes restricting sales of cartridge-based flavored e-cigarettes to places such as vape and tobacco shops that tend to enforce age restrictions better, senior FDA officials told CNBC last week. The agency also plans to ban online sales until manufacturers implement FDA-mandated guidelines for age verification, said the FDA officials, who asked not to be named because the proposal is not yet public.\n\nSome other e-cigarette makers have publicly shared their plans to cooperate with the FDA. Altria said it will voluntarily remove its MarkTen pod-based products and will stop selling all flavors except for menthol or tobacco in its \"cig-a-like\" products until the FDA reviews and approves them. The company said it also supports federal legislation to make 21 the minimum age to buy tobacco products.\n\nFontem Ventures, a unit of tobacco company Imperial Brands and maker of blu e-cigarettes, said it will raise the minimum age requirements to buy pods on its website to 21 across the U.S. and review its packaging and product descriptions.\n\nBritish American Tobacco, which makes Vuse e-cigarettes, will establish and enforce contractual penalties for retail partners that sell tobacco products to minors, a spokesman said in an email to CNBC on Tuesday. It will create a secret shopper program to check compliance and establish an enforcement monitoring program.\n\nBAT, along with Altria and Juul, said they support raising the minimum tobacco buying age to 21. Fontem Ventures said it will support raising the age for online purchases.\n\nJapan Tobacco International, which makes Logic e-cigarettes, has not made its plan public. A spokesman did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.", "WHEN: Today, Tuesday, November 13, 2018\n\nWHERE: CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\"\n\nThe following is the unofficial transcript of a CNBC EXCLUSIVE interview with U.S. Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Division Makan Delrahim and CNBC's David Faber on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" (M-F 9AM \u2013 11AM) today, Tuesday, November 13th. The following is a link to video from the interview on CNBC.com: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/11/13/department-of-justices-antitrust-chief-on-regulating-big-tech.html.\n\nAll references must be sourced to CNBC.\n\nDAVID FABER: Welcome back to \"Squawk on the Street.\" I'm David Faber here on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. I'm very excited to introduce our guest this morning, Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division: Makan Delrahim, a man I have not seen since we were together in the spring at the Milken Institute Annual Meeting. Very nice to have you for an official interview here this morning. And, Makan, let me get right to it. I can't remember a period of time, certainly, in the recent past where we've had more discussions, at least, both at the executive level by the president, but generally speaking as well, about the power of big business, in particular the power of some of our key technology companies. You're no stranger to what's going on in the news from your perch at the Department of Justice. How seriously do you think about \"the power of big,\" if I could put it that simply, and what it actually means from an anti-trust perspective?\n\nMAKAN DELRAHIM: Well, we've discussed this before. You know, one of our roles in the anti-trust laws is to make sure that the \u2013 you know, when companies get big \u2013 and we want to \u2013 we don't have any problem with companies being big, it's when they get big, they behave properly. And to make sure that the markets are open; that new entrants enter in, new competitors and ultimately the consumers and businesses will benefit from that.\n\nFABER: I'm sure you may have seen this article. Interestingly -- there's been lots of good press for our interview, not to mention the president which we'll get to. But Tim Wu, a law professor that specializes in anti-trust, New York Times editorial this weekend, talked about Congress passing the Anti-Merger Act of 1950 but he also said, \"It would be understandable if you assumed [it had been] repealed. But it remains on the books. It has merely been evaded, eroded and enfeebled by the corroding effect of decades of industry pressure and ideological drift, yielding\" what he says is, \"hesitant enforcers and a hostile judiciary.\" How do you respond to criticisms like that?\n\nDELRAHIM: Well look I respect him quite a bit. He's great. He has been very thoughtful. He has been certainly thoughtful on the At&T/Time Warner Merger that we challenged. I don't think there has been much hostility. I think the laws have been pretty well calibrated. Do we have challenges? Absolutely. But I think those are good challenges and checks and balances on our powers. We go to the court system. We have to prove our case. We have to prove it with good, strong evidence. We also have to prove it with sound economics. And over the last 30, 40 years, we've had pretty strong and bipartisan consensus on the -- what the balance, and the right balance for anti-trust enforcement is. Now, are there areas that, you know -- do we wish he'd go a different way? Are there cases we lose? Absolutely.\n\nFABER: Right. But do you agree with his contention then, and I'll read here, that \"there's a direct link between the concentration of business and the distortion of the democratic process\"?\n\nDELRAHIM: I don't think so. We have to be vigilant, make sure. That's why the anti-trust laws were enacted in the first place, to make sure that no single company or group of companies have the inordinate amount of power. That affects our lives. And there's been quite a bit of debate about these platforms, and what does that mean? Are they touching every aspect of our lives? Should they be this big? Should the government step in and somehow regulate their growth? And I think \u2013 you know, the anti-trust \u2013\n\nFABER: How close do you look at that issue when it comes to, in particular -- and again, we're talking about platforms, whether it be Amazon, Facebook or Alphabet, the existence of these enormous platforms and the influence they have? How seriously do you investigate it right now at the Department of Justice in terms of trying to get some answers?\n\nDELRAHIM: Well, we look at it. Whenever there's been challenges, we have -- the Justice Department brought a case on the eBooks matter not too long ago \u2013 just a couple of years ago, where some publishers and Apple had gotten together and successfully resolved that matter. We are constantly \u2013 what we look at we have to be careful in that we're just there to police the markets, we're not picking winners and losers. We are not trying to choose which technologies -- frankly, we're just not smart enough to be doing that. All we can do is make sure that markets are free for new entrants to come in and topple the old ones.\n\nFABER: And do you believe that's the case right now? I mean, we've had this discussion previously but this idea that innovation is somehow it's stymied by these giants who can conceivably presumably prevent capital flowing to new ideas because nobody wants to fund anybody getting into business to compete with them?\n\nDELRAHIM: Well, I don't know if that's true. I don't know if there's actual evidence of that. There might be in certain areas, certainly different investors. But it seems like Silicon Valley and the venture capital world, in this country in particularly, is alive and well. You're having new companies pop up, every now and then. But that's what we do. Anti-trust laws need to be there to make sure that they do not prevent the next competitor to come in. That was exactly what the justice department did in Microsoft 20 years ago. And a lot of people were worried about the power Microsoft had, and particularly when they were trying to suffocate the internet browser because it was challenging their monopoly power in the operating system. And I think that case probably led to a lot of the innovation we're seeing today.\n\nFABER: How do you respond to the president's tweets? I'm sure you hear about them if you don't read them directly. Yesterday, American Cable Association has big problems with Comcast, our parent company, by the way. They say that Comcast routinely violates anti-trust laws. When you see or hear something like that, what's your reaction?\n\nDELRAHIM: Well, look, the previous administration you know, brought an anti-trust case against Comcast when they bought NBC and settled it in a decree that just expired in September. We have been vigilant, and I think I owe that to the American consumer to continue to make sure the markets are working, despite the expiration of any consent decree. You know, I have - one of the things I've been both criticized and, I think, praised for is that I don't believe these behavioral consent decrees as a solution to these mergers. We come in and tell a company to withhold its natural tendencies, its natural incentives to make a profit and then they evaporate after five, seven, ten years. And it makes no sense. Because seven years before we're trying to guess where the market is. I believe in structural solutions. That's what we've suggested. We thought that's what it is --\n\nFABER: -- that's why you went after AT&T/Time Warner, the vertical merger that it was.\n\nDELRAHIM: Exactly. Yeah. Well only portions of it, not the whole merger. But the area where there was anti-competitive concern. And that was the solution we had provided. But that is one. But I think it's great that you know, you have the Administration, you also have members of Congress who are all very vigilant about anti-trust enforcement. And Comcast in particular, as well as At&T and other media because they affect so many Americans' lives.\n\nFABER: But when the president writes, and this is from this summer, \"In my opinion, The Washington Post is nothing more than an expensive lobbyist for Amazon as it uses protection against anti-trust claims, which many feel should be brought.\" Again, as the man who runs enforcement for the anti-trust division, when you hear something like that from the executive, is there a response that you have?\n\nDELRAHIM: Well, we hear that from executive and legislative. I mean, by the way, these types of concerns raised about Amazon are bipartisan. And Senators raise them, the president has raised it. It's -- again, I think it's great that we have such a debate about free markets and the anti-trust laws there to protect the free markets. As far as what we do in our enforcement, you know, we need the evidence, we need the economics, we go to court. And politics, you know, that goes on between various aspects of the government don't affect our decisions to make these cases.\n\nFABER: In the couple of minutes we have left, Makan, let me hit a couple of quick things: Time Warner/AT&T, when are you actually going to go to court again?\n\nDELRAHIM: The Court of Appeals in D.C. will be hearing the oral arguments December 6th. The parties, we had agreed with them to hold the Turner assets separate until the end of February and so they're supposed to be running that business a little bit separately so that in the event the court of appeals overturns the district court's decision as we argued -- and I think they should --\n\nFABER: I know you think they should. Whether or not they will \u2013\n\nDELRAHIM: Well, I think there's been a lot of support for our appeal. You know, you had those \u2013 the 29 or so economists, law professors, some of the country's biggest experts who supported our case because, frankly, the court's decision, and the lower court's decision had real serious flaws in economic logic. And so we'll see what happens there. If it does \u2013 but we hope there will be a decision before the end of February and then we'll take it from there.\n\nFABER: Talking about timelines. Can you give us any sense as to when the Department of Justice will complete its review of T-Mobile and Sprint's deal?\n\nDELRAHIM: A lot of times, these mergers, the parties control the timing \u2013 about the number of documents they provide. And in that particular transaction, we also \u2013 we're reviewing it, but also the Federal Communications Commission has a role in that transaction and I believe there's been a -- what they call the time clock over at the FCC for 180 days that has been stopped. I don't believe that has been restarted. So our timing will coincide together. I don't know exactly when it is, but, you know, I announced a number of reforms with the hope that if the parties cooperate with us, we'll be moving things forward and we hope to get every transaction reviewed within six months.\n\nFABER: Before going to three in the most important market for most people when it comes to the bill they pay, some would say simple violation of anti-trust law.\n\nDELRAHIM: Well, yes, except for simple violations of anti-trust law require evidence and the economics. So, we're reviewing the evidence in this case and if that's what the economics and the evidence shows, that it would substantially lessen competition, we would sue to block it. But if it doesn't, I don't think we have a magical number for any particular industry, which is what I've said in the past.\n\nFABER: Does leaving an enfeebled competitor worry you to act \u2013 sort of figure into your decision making? In other words, the idea that Sprint wouldn't ever be able to compete if it was truly left independent?\n\nDELRAHIM: That would certainly be one of the considerations that goes into a number of factors we would review to see, you know, what would happen to the competitive landscape. Does that -- what you're insinuating, does that mean there's only be then two competitors if this merger doesn't happen -- and one of them would fail or both of them might fail without this merger? Those would be factors we would consider. But I don't know if the evidence fully supports that.\n\nFABER: And, finally, your future. Some say, well, there's an opening now for Attorney General of the United States. Would you be interested?\n\nDELRAHIM: I have the best job, I think, in the government, running the anti-trust division. It's the job that I wanted. And I think the president has made a superb choice, as Deputy Rod Rosenstein said, in Matt Whitaker the acting Attorney General in the meantime. And I think there's gonna be a process, so I'm looking forward to see who will be the next AG. But as far me personally, I love the anti-trust division and I have the best job in the country.\n\nFABER: Well we appreciate your taking some time to talk about it with us.\n\nDELRAHIM: Thank you for having me.\n\nFABER: Makan Delrahim joining us.

She was discharged on Friday and worked from home, the court said.\n\nThe health of the 85-year-old liberal justice, the court's eldest, has been a matter of intense public concern in recent years. Her absence from the court would likely be filled by a conservative jurist appointed by President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Ginsburg has said recently that she plans to stay on the bench until she is at least 90. The former ACLU attorney has overcome a number of medical difficulties while on the bench with few signs of slowing down.\n\nAfter cracking two ribs in 2012, Ginsburg planned to work out the next day, her trainer Bryant Johnson told New York Magazine's The Cut in an interview last week.\n\nAfter the most recent fall, Johnson said that Ginsburg would likely have to hold off from working out for a week\n\n\"And then we'll pick back up just like we usually do, and I'll take in account for the ribs,\" he said. \"We may not do planks, we may, it all depends.\"\n\nGinsburg is the most senior member of the nine-member court's liberal wing, and has been influential in shaping American jurisprudence in matters of gender discrimination and women's reproductive health, among other areas.

The profit per month is down for mining from about $150 last summer, to an estimated $0 for November of this year, according to analysis by Susquehanna.\n\nIn mining, machines run 24 hours a day, competing against other computers around the world to solve complex math problems. The first computer, or multiple computers, to solve the problem earns a fixed amount of bitcoin or ethereum.\n\nThe \"hashrate,\" or speed at which a computer can complete that operation fell drastically for ethereum this year. A higher hashrate is better for miners and adds to the opportunity of finding the next \"block\" and therefore getting the reward of new cryptocurrency.\n\nThe value of ethereum meanwhile has dropped more than 70 percent this year, trading near $205 Tuesday, according to data from CoinDesk.\n\nThe combination of those factors means that mining ethereum using a GPU, Nvidia's flagship graphics card, is \"no longer profitable,\" Susquehanna semiconductor analyst Christopher Rolland said in a note to clients Tuesday.", "Behind the scenes at Mad Money's Veterans Day show: Q&A with Jim Cramer\n\n1:42 PM ET Tue, 13 Nov 2018\n\nJim Cramer answers current and former U.S. Armed Forces members' questions between takes at Mad Money's special Veterans Day show.", "Technologist Steve Wozniak told CNBC on Tuesday he had once hoped that Apple would build the first self-driving car.\n\nBut the Apple co-founder said, \"I do not believe in auto driving cars\" at this point. \"I don't really believe it's quite possible yet\" that cars will be able to drive themselves without a steering wheel, he added.\n\nWozniak said on \"Fast Money Halftime Report\" that roads are not prepared for autonomous vehicles because they are built by imperfect humans who are \"not as good as nature and mathematics and even evolution.\"\n\nHowever, Wozniak does support of advancements in \"assistive driving\" technology that can allow cars to \"spot red lights, and stop signs and avoid some of the accidents today.\"\n\nBut he warned that people should \"not to lose sight of the fact you're not going to get a car that drives itself.\"\n\nWozniak \u2014 who owns a Tesla and said he enjoys driving it \u2014 warned that the so-called Autopilot feature does not actually self-drive the car.\n\n\"Tesla makes so many mistakes,\" he said, but didn't elaborate. \"It really convinces me that auto piloting and auto steering car driving itself is not going to happen.\"\n\nWozniak said he kept upgrading his Tesla and then \"gave up\" on the idea of autonomous driving. \"I said, 'It's really not going to happen,'\" he recalled.\n\nTesla was not immediately available to respond to CNBC's request for comment on Wozniak's interview.", "WASHINGTON \u2014 Secretary of Defense James Mattis will travel to Texas on Wednesday to visit troops currently deployed in support of the Southwest border mission.\n\nMattis' trip comes amid a significant active-duty troop presence along the U.S. border with Mexico to deter a caravan of migrants seeking asylum.\n\nThe Department of Defense estimates that more than 7,000 troops will be positioned in California, Arizona and Texas in support of the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Democrats plan to investigate some of those attacks when they take the House of Representatives next year, according to a Sunday report in Axios. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSchiff cited the president's opposition to the $85 billion merger between CNN parent company Time Warner and AT&T, as well as an alleged plot to \"browbeat the postmaster [general] into raising postal rates on Amazon.\" Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, owns The Washington Post, and is a frequent target of the president's barbs.\n\nDelrahim said Tuesday that the department gets input on antitrust matters from both the executive and legislative branches.\n\n\"By the way, these types of concerns raised about Amazon are bipartisan,\" he said. \"Senators raise them. The president has raised it.\"\n\nThe Time Warner-AT&T merger was approved by a federal judge earlier this year, though the Justice Department has appealed the decision.\n\nAT&T accused Trump of wielding political influence over the department as it pursued its case against the media conglomerate. The DOJ denied any improper influence. In an affidavit at the time, Delrahim insisted he had received no \"orders, instructions, or directions\" in conjunction with the merger.\n\nThe president has said that he has stayed away from the Justice Department's litigation, though he has continued to comment on antitrust matters. As recently as Monday, Trump wrote in a post on Twitter that the American Cable Association has \"big problems\" with Comcast, which owns CNBC's parent company NBCUniversal.\n\n\"They say that Comcast routinely violates Antitrust Laws,\" Trump wrote. Citing a statement made by Fox Business Network correspondent Charles Gasparino, Trump suggested that Comcast posed bigger threats than the Time Warner-AT&T merger.\n\nThe ACA, which represents more than 700 video and broadband providers, is asking the Justice Department to open an investigation into Comcast.\n\nEarlier this month, the ACA sent a five-page letter to Delrahim alleging that Comcast has shown a \"willingness to harm rivals\" and offering its assistance in any potential inquiry.\n\nThe letter was sent amid reports that AT&T had approached Comcast subsidiary NBCUniversal to discuss potential licensing deals that could threaten media rivals such as Disney and Netflix. In a statement, Comcast said that ACA's letter was \"without merit and constitutes an inappropriate attempt to gain leverage in the commercial marketplace.\"\n\nPowerful Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., have raised antitrust issues regarding corporate giants such as Amazon and Comcast.\n\nWarren told The New York Times earlier this year that Amazon has \"got to pick one business or the other.\" Meanwhile, Blumenthal called for a renewed investigation into Comcast's integration with NBCUniversal, saying the merger of the two companies, approved in 2011, poses a \"very serious threat to competition.\"\n\nThe president has targeted NBC News, a unit of NBCUniversal, throughout his presidency. In September, the president threatened to \"look at\" NBC's television license, calling the network \"fake news\" and saying that he had \"long criticized NBC and its journalistic standards\u2014worse than even CNN.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, CNN filed a lawsuit against the president and his top associates alleging violations of the First and Fifth amendments of the Constitution for suspending the press pass of the network's chief White House correspondent, Jim Acosta.\n\nDisclosure: Comcast owns CNBC's parent company NBCUniversal.\n\n\n\nWATCH:Trump's tweets can cost a company billions of dollars.

But if you're sitting in traffic on your way to work every day, it's time to quit Google Maps and move over to Waze.\n\nWaze, which is owned by Google, has some of the same traffic information that you find on Google Maps, but it's provided in real time by other nearby drivers using the app. In my area, for example, it has data from more than 50,000 other drivers on nearby roads.\n\nIt's super useful because drivers ahead of you can tell you about road closures, traffic, police officers, accidents and more.

Depending on how a recount in Florida and runoff in Mississippi play out, Republicans could hold their current 51 seats or expand their majority to 53 seats in January. The election could have gone worse for Democrats: 26 Democratic senators and independents who caucus with them faced re-election this year, while only nine Republican-held seats were up for grabs.", "Conventional wisdom holds that you should negotiate your salary when you apply for a job, since that usually won't hurt your chances of landing an offer as long as you remain likable, and pocketing a few extra thousand dollars every year can add up as you get older. And when it comes to negotiating there's no shortage of advice on what works and what doesn't. You should know what you're worth, for instance, and be ready to justify why you're asking for more.\n\nBut regardless of how much you prepare, new research suggests that if you're black, racial bias can lessen the offer you end up receiving.\n\n\"Racially-biased job evaluators see black job-seekers as less deserving of higher monetary awards and take issue when the black job seekers ask for more,\" Morela Hernandez, an associate professor at the University of Virginia, tells CNBC Make It.\n\nIn the paper \"Bargaining While Black,\" Hernandez and her colleagues suggest this bias may help explain the significant racial wage gap in the U.S. In 2016 the Pew Research Center reported that college-educated black men earn 20 percent less than college-educated white men. That's the difference between making $25 and $32 per hour.\n\nMeanwhile, college-educated black women earn 8 percent less than college-educated white women. When you don't account for education, the gap becomes even more significant.\n\nThe researchers identified the salary negotiation process as a potential contributor to this trend through a series of experiments. In the first, study participants completed a survey to determine their own racial bias. Then they looked at resumes and headshots to estimate the likelihood that hypothetical job seekers would negotiate their salaries. Participants who demonstrated racial bias, the researchers found, expected black job-seekers would negotiate less than white job seekers.\n\nThen participants were randomly assigned to be either hiring evaluators or job candidates and, in one-on-one scenarios, negotiated for a salary between $82,000 to $90,000. Race had no real effect on how much the candidates negotiated, but some of the participants incorrectly thought it did.\n\n\"Racially-biased job evaluators consistently overestimated the number of offers and counteroffers black job seekers made,\" says Hernandez. \"This underlines how our brains can see something that isn't in fact there by virtue of the lens we use to interpret the situation.\"\n\nBiased evaluators expected black job-seekers to negotiate less than the white job-seekers. Yet once the researchers put it to the test, those evaluators thought the black job-seekers actually negotiated more. As a result, they were \"less willing to make concessions.\"\n\nIn other words, because their expectations were violated, they gave the black candidates less money.", "Starbucks is planning to cut approximately 5 percent of its global corporate workforce, according to a memo sent by CEO Kevin Johnson on Tuesday.\n\nAbout 350 employees in marketing, creative, product, technology and store development will be impacted, Johnson said in the memo obtained by CNBC.\n\nJohnson said affected divisions will undergo \"significant changes\" as Starbucks narrows its priorities and aims to become a more nimble company.

With up to 166 million shares in the offering, the full sale would see GE get about $4 billion in cash in the fourth quarter if executed near Baker Hughes' latest stock price of about $24 a share.\n\n\"The agreements announced today accelerate that plan in a manner that mutually benefits both companies and their shareholders,\" GE chairman and CEO Larry Culp said in a statement.\n\nGE shares rose 7.8 percent in trading Tuesday, closing with their best day since April 2015.

GE shares have been under steady pressure since the company reported disappointing third-quarter earnings and an expanding federal investigation into the company's accounting practices.\n\nThe Baker Hughes stake sale comes as the second action by Culp to level the company's balance sheet since taking GE's helm at the beginning of October. Culp slashed the company's quarter dividend to a penny a share in his first move as CEO. He acknowledged that the cut likely caused regular investors to flee the stock.\n\nGE negotiated a release from a previous lock-up period so it could sell Baker Hughes shares. The previous lock-up was set to last until July 2019. The release allows GE to perform this sale, accelerating the plan the company laid out in June.

Pelosi hosted the event for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which is the leading group dedicated to electing Democrats to the House.\n\nShe praised the financiers for out-raising their rivals, the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\nAccording to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, the Democratic committee brought in more than $250 million throughout the 2018 election cycle while the Republican committee raised just over $174 million.\n\nEvent attendees privately discussed how they were going to help Pelosi become the next speaker of the House, according to a person who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Several lawmakers within the Democratic House caucus have said they do not want Pelosi to have a second tenure as speaker. However, it remains unclear whether they will actually go through with voting against her in either the initial caucus vote in November or the full floor vote in January.\n\nOne potential tactic discussed by lobbyists in Pelosi's inner circle: telling lawmakers on the fence about her that voting against giving her the speaker's gavel would amount to blocking progress for women after a historic election. NBC News is projecting at least 101 women who ran for House seats will win their respective races this year. NBC also projects Democrats will gain at least 31 seats in the House, while Republicans are going to expand their thin majority in the Senate.\n\nPelosi became the first female speaker in 2007. She handed the gavel to Republican John Boehner in 2011.\n\nHer lieutenants plan to point to her successful fundraising effort in 2018 and will argue that it was one of the reasons so many women won House races.

Dell needs a majority of the holders of the tracking stock to approve the deal.\n\nDell issued the tracking stock in 2016 to buy data storage company EMC for $67 billion because it could not pay for the entire deal in cash and did not want to add to its debt burden.\n\nEMC owned a majority stake in VMware, which Dell inherited. The security \"tracks,\" or depends on, the financial performance of VMware, and has been trading at a significant discount to VMware's stock. This has emboldened investors such as Icahn to argue that Dell's offer undervalues the tracking stock.\n\nDell has so far offered $109 in cash for each tracking share, up to $9 billion in total, with the remainder payable with 1.3665 shares of Dell's Class C common stock for each tracking share. That is equivalent to a 41/59 cash-stock split.\n\nDell has said it plans to use a special dividend from VMware to fund the $9 billion portion of the deal.\n\nThe parties are close to a deal, according to the sources. Dell is hoping to conclude negotiations with owners of the tracking stock and table a new offer as early as this week, the sources said.\n\nNegotiations have focused on a valuation of between $120 and $130 for each tracking share, though a final decision has not been made, some of the sources added. The tracking stock was trading on Tuesday morning at around $100.\n\nThe sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Dell and Silver Lake declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal had reported last week that Dell was looking at improving on its tracking stock offer.\n\nThe tracking stock battle has echoes of the $24.9 billion deal that Dell and Silver Lake clinched to take the company private in 2013, a transaction that Icahn also opposed. In that case, Icahn also managed to secure a slight improvement to the offer.\n\nAs a public company, Dell could more easily use its stock as currency for acquisitions. While its debt has dropped from $57.3 billion following the EMC deal to $50.3 billion, it remains heavily indebted. The company continues to pay down debt and has told investors it aims for an investment-grade rating sometime next year.", "British and EU negotiators have agreed a draft text of a Brexit accord that has been sent to Prime Minister Theresa May for political endorsement, a senior EU official told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\n\"There is a common understanding on texts,\" the official said. A second official said that national envoys from the 27 member states would be briefed on the negotiations at 3 p.m. (1400 GMT) on Wednesday -- the same time as May will brief her fractious cabinet on the potential deal.\n\nA month ago, the negotiators completed a draft text which was rejected by the British government.

In the absence of a Withdrawal Agreement, the European Union will act to protect its interests, and should display a united and coordinated approach in all areas,\" the Commission said.\n\nIn London, the BBC said the EU and Britain had agreed a draft Brexit divorce deal text and Prime Minister Theresa May would present the agreement to her senior ministers on Wednesday. Any deal has to be approved by parliament.\n\nThe Commission said it intended to propose all necessary legislative measures and adopt all the legal acts required for preparing the EU for Britain crashing out without a divorce deal before Dec 31.\n\nIt said this deadline would give the European Parliament and EU governments the time needed to complete the procedures in time for Brexit day.\n\nThe Commission said the time needed for these procedure could not be contracted because EU treaties provided for an eight-week period for the consultation of national parliaments while some legal acts were subject to mandatory scrutiny by the European Parliament and governments.\n\nIt said the risks of financial instability in the event of a no-deal Brexit have \"diminished significantly\" due to ongoing contingency preparations, though such a scenario could still pose risks for cleared derivatives.\n\nAnnouncing its latest contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit, the EU's executive said it was looking at temporary bridging solutions to mitigate disruption in key areas.\n\nOn air traffic, the Commission said it would propose extending current rules to allow UK airlines to land in EU territory and take off from its airports, but that this was conditional on Britain applying equivalent measures for carriers from the bloc.\n\nFor road transport, however, the Commission said its unilateral contingency measures \"would allow for considerably less traffic than what currently takes place between the Union and the United Kingdom\".", "White House reportedly looking to replace Kelly, Nielsen 7:45 AM ET Wed, 14 Nov 2018 | 02:24\n\nMultiple outlets also reported that Trump also planned to remove deputy national security advisor Mira Ricardel, who is a top staffer to national security advisor John Bolton.\n\nIn an unusually harsh statement Tuesday, the first lady's spokeswoman said Ricardel \"no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, citing a White House official, reported shortly after that statement that Ricardel had been fired and escorted from the White House. But another official told reporters the story was untrue, and that Ricardel still worked at the White House.\n\nAsked to confirm or deny that Ricardel still worked at the White House, Grisham told CNBC: \"I have no idea.\"\n\nMultiple outlets had reported Tuesday that Ricardel had clashed with the first lady's staff during a trip to Africa last month, among other disputes.

Even though payrolls have been growing at a solid clip, complaints persist from companies that they are having a hard time finding qualified workers to fill positions because of a skills gap.\n\nKashkari, though, said he doesn't completely buy the argument that there aren't enough bodies out there.\n\n\"I oftentimes hear businesses saying I just can't find the workers that I need,\" the central bank official said during a conference on immigration in his home district. \"Now, I'm not entirely sympathetic with that view, because I've been saying you should try paying more, and you may be able to attract more workers.\"\n\n\"But nonetheless, the unemployment rate is going down, and there is a question about where the workforce is going to come from,\" he added.\n\nImmigration would be one answer to solving the issue, with low population and productivity growth, Kashkari said.\n\nIn talking to business contacts around his district, he said, \"You realize that immigration does have a role to play in helping both those problems.\"\n\nWage growth has been nudging higher lately, with average hourly earnings growth at 3.1 percent in October from the same period a year ago. That has helped the Fed stay around its 2 percent inflation goal as central bank officials maintain that the unemployment rate is below the long-term normal level.\n\nThe Fed has been gradually raising short-term rates in an attempt to tamp down a future inflation threat.

But the number of newly arriving students slid to about 271,000, the lowest levels since 2013.\n\nThe report's authors cited sharper competition from other countries including Australia and Canada, along with the rising cost of education in the U.S. They largely dismissed worries among some colleges that the White House's policies and rhetoric surrounding immigration could be driving students away.\n\n\"We're not hearing that students feel they can't come here. We're hearing that they have choices,\" Allan Goodman, president and CEO of the institute, said in a call with reporters. \"For the first time, we have real competition.\"\n\nBut some schools contacted by The Associated Press say the political climate in the U.S. has made international students feel unwelcome, leading some to enroll elsewhere.\n\nState Department officials underscored that the U.S. hosted nearly 1.1 million international students last year, more than any other country in the world.\n\nYet the 1.5 percent growth is the slowest since a period from 2002 through 2005, when international enrollment fell by 4 percent following the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, according to data provided by the institute.\n\nAmong new students, the steepest losses came from Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Mexico, while China and India continued to send the largest numbers, accounting for more than half of all foreign students in the U.S.\n\nThe 15 percent decrease from Saudi Arabia comes a year after the kingdom scaled back a scholarship program that covered costs for Saudis studying abroad.\n\nAlthough the report focuses on data from 2017, it also included preliminary findings for fall 2018. Among 540 schools surveyed, total international enrollment held level while the number of new students fell by about 2 percent, marking the third straight year of declines.\n\nCompared to the previous year, more schools attributed decreases to challenges in the visa process, the U.S. social and political climate, and student decisions to enroll in other countries.\n\nAt the University of Central Missouri, foreign enrollment surged to 2,600 in 2016 before plummeting to just 650 this year, according to data obtained by The AP. University officials have noticed increased competition but also cite the nation's political climate.\n\n\"We have had conversations with parents who feel like their children will not be safe here, that their son or daughter may not be physically safe,\" said Karen Goos, the school's assistant vice provost for enrollment management. \"I do think that it's a contributing factor.\"\n\nAt Purdue University, one of the nation's biggest hubs for international students, total foreign enrollment fell by 2 percent this year. Officials said they intentionally admitted fewer undergraduates from abroad amid worries that they might not accept the offer.\n\n\"There was concern that students might not find the U.S. to be as an attractive destination given certain political rhetoric these past two years,\" Michael Brzezinski, Purdue's dean of international programs, said in an email.\n\nLosing foreign students can carry financial implications for schools that rely on them for revenue. Unlike U.S. citizens, who often get scholarships or discounts, students from abroad are typically charged full tuition.\n\nAt Central Missouri, the declines have worsened a budget hole that led to more than $20 million in cuts last year.\n\nAt the same time, some other nations have drawn surging numbers of students from abroad. Canada reported a 20 percent jump in 2017, while Australia saw a 12 percent increase. Both countries have set ambitious goals to bolster international enrollments in the coming years.\n\nYet officials in Australia said they shouldn't be blamed for America's slowdown. Phil Honeywood, CEO of the International Education Association of Australia, said pinning it on competition is \"pure blame shifting,\" adding that Australia hasn't significantly changed its recruiting strategy over the past two years.\n\n\"Rather, everything we hear from prospective students and their education agents in Muslim countries and Latin American nations is that they no longer feel welcome or safe studying at U.S. colleges under President Trump,\" Honeywood said in a statement.\n\nDespite the downturn in new students, officials behind the report are optimistic that the U.S. will rebound. While foreign students account for a heavy share of the overall enrollment in Australia and other countries, they account for just 5 percent of all students in the United States.\n\n\"The U.S. has real competition,\" Goodman said. \"What we have going for us, though, is we have more space and capacity.\"\n\nThe report also found that the number of U.S. students studying abroad ticked up by 2 percent last year, continuing eight years of slow but steady growth. Europe remained the top destination, followed by Latin America and Asia.", "Wall Street is crazy for punishing Home Depot for a great quarterly earnings report, CNBC's Jim Cramer argued on Tuesday.\n\n\"Home Depot was not dead,\" Cramer said on \"Squawk on the Street\" as the Dow component was falling sharply.\n\nFor Advanced Auto Parts to be up so strongly \"on a very small comp beat and Home Depot to be down?\" Cramer asked.\n\nThat's \"absurd,\" he argued.\n\nBefore the bell on Tuesday, Home Depot reported third-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations.

It'll now just be part of Google. The company announced the news via a blog post on Tuesday, where it stressed that it will continue with health research through its academic partners, but that products ready to be deployed will now be under the Google umbrella.\n\nDeepMind's health team built an app called Streams, which helps doctors and other clinicians spot signs of kidney failure and other ailments. In June of 2018, the company disclosed that more than 100 people work solely in health care, and the app has signed deals to be used by 10 hospitals in the UK's National Health Service. Those people will remain in London and continue to work under Dominic King, the company's health lead.\n\nKing said Google provides a platform to \"bring our technologies to the wider world.\"\n\nStreams found itself at the center of a controversy in 2016 when the New Scientist reported that its collaboration with the U.K.'s National Health Service went far beyond what was publicly announced. The company appointed an independent review board in February of 2016, it said in a company blog post, to meet regularly and scrutinize its work. Sources say that board will now likely be shut down as Google looks to expand the scope of its app beyond the U.K.\n\nDeepMind, which is one of the Alphabet portfolio companies with a health team, was acquired by Alphabet about four years ago to do futuristic AI work, like teaching computer systems to beat top-ranked players of the Chinese board game Go. Other portions of DeepMind will remain independent.\n\nThe newly-formed Google Health entity will include a products division, which incorporates health hardware, as well as a research effort. The company has made significant investments in bringing digital technologies to the medical sector, as it looks to diversify its portfolio outside of advertising and search.\n\n\"It has been a phenomenal journey to see Streams go from initial idea to live deployment, and to hear how it's helped change the lives of patients and the nurses and doctors who treat them. I can't think of a better person than Dr. David Feinberg to lead health efforts at Google, helping to make a difference to the lives of millions of patients around the world,\" said Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of DeepMind, in a statement. \"I'm excited to watch Streams take flight.\"\n\nWATCH: This brainwave-reading headband is designed to help users meditate", "Americans are cutting back on how much money they spend. More than two-thirds of U.S. adults say they're making an effort to reduce their monthly budget in order to save more, according to a new survey from consumer-financial company Bankrate. But saving isn't the only reason they're cutting back.\n\nWhile 36 percent say their priority is saving, 24 percent say they're curbing their spending because their income hasn't changed. About 17 percent say they have too much debt, 11 percent say they're worried about the economy and 5 percent are concerned about job security.\n\nTrying to spend less makes sense for most people, regardless of the reason. A survey from personal-finance website GOBankingRates found that 42 percent of Americans have less than $10,000 put away for retirement, while a Northwestern Mutual study found that a third of Americans had less than $5,000 for retirement and 21 percent had nothing saved at all. And only 39 percent of adults say they have enough in savings to handle a $1,000 emergency.\n\nMeanwhile, middle-class incomes have shrunk in all but two states, credit card debt has hit $1 trillion and student loan debt exceeds $1.5 trillion.\n\nBankrate: Biggest reason to spend less\n\nHouseholds earning more are most likely to limit their spending in order to save. The survey finds that \"households with incomes of $50,000 per year, or more, were more likely to say they needed to limit their spending to save,\" and \"also more likely to report being frugal, on a budget or having no desire to spend more money.\"\n\nThat's compared to households with incomes under $30,000, which are more likely to cut back due to worries about the economy.\n\nYounger Americans also prioritize saving more than their older peers. About 45 percent of millennials who are cutting back are doing so to save, versus 41 percent of those in Generation X.\n\n\"Older Americans aren't showing the same dedication,\" says Bankrate. \"Stagnant income was the top response for Baby Boomers and the Silent Generation.\"\n\nBankrate: Generation most likely to limit spending\n\nWhatever the reason for cutting down on spending, there are some strategies that could help you out, \"starting with a budget,\" the survey says.\n\n\"After subtracting fixed monthly expenses\" like rent or a car payment from your income, allocating funds to variable expenses like food and entertainment \"will give a clearer picture of how much you should be spending each month. Experts recommend taking a monthly average of variable costs to determine how much you'll need to budget for; after, evaluate the categories and see where you can cut costs.\"\n\nTom Corley, author of \"Rich Kids: How to Raise Our Children to Be Happy and Successful in Life,\" recommends the 80:20 rule, in which you live off 80 percent of your paycheck and save the rest. \"It's a simple rule,\" he writes, that you can follow no matter how much you make.\n\nWhatever your income and expenses look like, know what you spend each month and create a budget.

And it turns out, that's no different if you're the first lady of the United States.\n\nMichelle Obama, in her new book \"Becoming,\" reveals that she felt \"overwhelmed,\" \"unworthy\" and \"uncertain of [her] purpose\" when her husband's appointment as president propelled her to become the country's first African-American first lady.\n\nIn fact, Obama said it wasn't until two months in, when she met with a group of schoolgirls from north London, that she figured out the real purpose of her role.\n\n\"At this point, I'd been first lady for just over two months,\" Obama writes in her memoir, released on Tuesday. \"In different moments, I'd felt overwhelmed by the pace, unworthy of the glamour, anxious about our children, and uncertain of my purpose.\"\n\nIt was early 2009, and the Obamas were in the U.K. on their first official overseas visit. While President Barack Obama was meeting with officials, the then-first lady was invited to a government-funded, all-girls secondary school in London's Islington neighborhood. Like herself, the majority of the girls there were ethnic minorities from modest backgrounds.", "Just a fraction of Americans are exercising as much as they're supposed to, costing the health-care system billions of dollars and contributing to people dying early.\n\nOnly 26 percent of men, 19 percent of women and 20 percent of adolescents meet the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' exercise recommendations, according to the agency. Failing to meet the suggested levels of aerobic physical activity adds nearly $117 billion in annual health-care costs and contributes to 10 percent of all premature mortality, HHS said Monday in announcing its latest guidelines.\n\nThe data highlight the challenges of persuading Americans to become more active. Between 2015 and 2016, about 93.3 million U.S. adults \u2014 nearly 40 percent \u2014 were considered obese, as were nearly 1 in 5 children and adolescents ages 6 to 19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAdults need 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity each week and two days of muscle strengthening activities to stay healthy, and children and adolescents ages 6 to 17 need 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity every day, HHS says. Most of their time should be spent on aerobic activity but should also include muscle-strengthening and bone-strengthening activities at least three days a week.\n\nPhysical activity leads to man immediate and long-term health benefits, the agency said in its updated guidelines.\n\nOne round of exercise can reduce anxiety and blood pressure, as well as leading to better sleep and improved insulin sensitivity, the agency said. In the long run, physical activity can improve brain health and reduce the risk for eight types of cancer, fall-related injuries in older adults and excessive weight gain, HHS added.\n\nThe agency first published activity guidelines in 2008 to help control the U.S. obesity epidemic. In 2008, the medical costs of obesity were estimated at $147 billion, with costs for people who were obese being $1,429 higher than people of normal weight, according to CDC.\n\nWATCH: Fitness trackers are terrible at counting calories", "The Ebola outbreak in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, which has already killed more than 200 people, is expected to last until mid-2019, a senior World Health Organization official said on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's very hard to predict timeframes in an outbreak as complicated as this with so many variables that are outside our control, but certainly we're planning on at least another six months before we can declare this outbreak over,\" WHO emergency response chief Peter Salama told reporters.\n\nThe outbreak in Congo's North Kivu province has caused 333 confirmed and probable cases of the deadly virus, and is now the worst in Congo's history.\n\nThe location of the disease is perhaps the most difficult the WHO has ever enountered, due to a dense and mobile local population, insecurity caused by two armed groups, and its spread by transmission in health centres, Salama said.\n\nOne of the major drivers of the spread of the disease was due to people visiting the several hundred \"tradi-modern\" health centres in the town of Beni, he said.\n\n\"Those facilities, we believe, are one of the major drivers of transmission,\" he said.\n\nThe tradi-modern facilities were unregulated, informal, and varied from being a standalone structure to a room in someone's house, and were not set up to spot Ebola, let alone tackle cases of the disease.\n\nMany had no running water for handwashing, and patients - who generally opted for injectable medicine because they felt it gave them a stronger form of medicine - would reuse needles.\n\n\"With the injections come the risks,\" Salama said.\n\nThere had been an epidemiological breakthrough around late October, when a change in the age distribution of Ebola patients revealed that many of them were children being treated for malaria in the tradi-modern health centres.", "PresidentDonald Trump's administration is looking at a multifaceted infrastructure plan, according to top White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow on Tuesday.\n\n\"We are looking at infrastructure in many different ways,\" Kudlow said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\"\n\n\"I'd like to do energy infrastructure. I'd like to do pipeline,\" Kudlow said. \"I'd like to do anything that will help LNG, terminals, shipping. We'd like to revise the U.S. shipping industry, which has been dormant for many years. We'd like to export oil, natural gas to Europe and to Asia.\"\n\nThere are early signs that European leaders would be willing to support the building of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, import terminals. New terminals could lead to an increase of American LNG exported to the continent. Trump met with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in July, and boosting natural gas trade was one of the top issues.\n\n\"They want LNG, they want it badly, and we're going to do everything we can to accommodate them,\" Kudlow said.\n\nAs the U.S. continues trade talks with Europe, the Trump administration has continued to push its European allies to import more LNG. The U.S. is also urging Europe to reduce its reliance on Russian state-controlled companies for natural gas transported by pipeline. Russia dominates Europe's supply of natural gas. But the U.S. is making some early inroads into the European market, as the German government offered support to build an LNG terminal in northern Germany.\n\nTrump has made infrastructure a priority in domestic politics as well. A day after the 2018 midterm elections, Trump said he hopes to work with congressional Democrats on infrastructure.

Some states' most unique jobs will have an outsize score. Washington, D.C.'s quotient of 117.08 for political scientists, for example, emphasizes politics as the city's biggest employer.\n\nBut other places, like Pennsylvania, have more diverse economies that aren't particularly dominated by one industry or job. Pennsylvania's most unique role, ambulance driver, earns a score of 3.66, which is above but still fairly close to the national average. Some states share the same most unique job.

The new age requirements will apply even for sales to consumers living in states with lower age limits, the company said.\n\nIt also plans to review its packaging and product descriptions, possibly changing them, to ensure they're \"responsible,\" CEO Richard Hill told CNBC. Unlike some of its competitors that are pulling flavored nicotine pods off the market, blu will continue selling its sweeter flavors, including \"honeymoon,\" \"neon dream,\" \"blue ice\" and \"melon time,\" according to a list on its website. Critics argue fruity flavors attract kids to e-cigarettes, but the company insists they help former adult smokers switch to its products.\n\n\"We don't think our products are attractive to kids but are for adults. I'm actually sitting here as we speak vaping on blueberry,\" Hill said during a phone interview with CNBC.\n\nFood and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb in September ordered Imperial Brands and four other manufacturers \u2014 Juul Labs, British American Tobacco, Altria and Japan Tobacco International \u2014 to come up with solutions to what he's calling \"epidemic\" levels of teens using e-cigarettes by last Sunday.\n\nSome of the companies have released their plans. Altria said it will voluntarily remove its MarkTen pod-based products and will stop selling all flavors except for menthol or tobacco in its \"cig-a-like\" products until the FDA reviews and approves them. The company said it also supports federal legislation to make 21 the minimum age to buy tobacco products.\n\nJuul, the market leader, plans to pull its mango, cucumber, fruit and creme flavored nicotine pods from convenience store and other retailers, a person briefed on the company's plan who asked not to be named because the proposal is not yet public told CNBC. The company plans to restrict most of its sales to its age-verified online shop, the person said.\n\nFontem Ventures' Hill said the manufacturer stands behind its flavors because research shows they're \"really important\" in helping smokers switch from conventional cigarettes. Plus, he's not convinced flavors alone caused a surge in teen use. Instead, he thinks it's the marketing practices of \"one brand,\" though he declined to name which one.\n\n\"When you look at the issue of youth access generally, let's be clear: We see this as being caused by the irresponsible actions of one brand in particular,\" he said. \"Thinking about this as an industry issue is slightly wrong, but nonetheless, we take this issue very seriously.\"\n\nFontem Ventures will instead focus most of its efforts on limiting teen access of its products.\n\nIt will also start a hotline for consumers to report underage sales of its products and create a new youth access officer to oversee efforts to monitor social media. Juul has already started scraping Instagram and Facebook to scrape inappropriate posts.\n\nFontem Ventures pledges to end contracts with retailers found illegally selling e-cigarettes to teens despite a federal ban on sales to minors.\n\nFontem Ventures also plans to start testing connected devices outside of the U.S. early next year that may be equipped child locks and geofencing technology to prevent minors from using the e-cigarettes. In order to introduce new e-cigarettes in the U.S., companies need to submit them to the FDA for review.\n\nGottlieb told CNBC in September he's considering fast-tracking the process for e-cigarettes with features proven to keep kids from using them. He's expected to announce this week new restrictions on where pod-based flavored e-cigarettes can be sold, barring them from convenience stores and gas stations, senior FDA officials told CNBC.\n\nSo even though Fontem Ventures doesn't plan to pull its flavored products from stores, regulators may limit where they can be sold.\n\nWATCH:How Juul made vaping cool and became a $15 billion e-cigarette giant", "1. For individual bonds, you can ladder them.\n\nThis means buying bonds with consecutive annual maturities, i.e., maturing every year for the next five years, and when the bond that matures in one year matures, reinvest the principal into a new bond with a five-year maturity. It's a compromise that allows for adjustments to changes in interest rates and inflation, but it lowers your interest income because you didn't invest all of your funds into just the five-year bond.\n\n2. With traditional mutual funds, you can build a diversified portfolio of bonds and maturities.\n\nSince these bond funds won't actually have a finite maturity date, you could rebalance them periodically since their dollar amounts will fluctuate, some more than others. This way, you could stick with an appropriate risk/reward level and take advantage of price discrepancies between the bond funds.\n\nFor example, let's say an investor invests an equal amount into a money market fund yielding 2 percent and three different kinds of investment-grade bond ETFs: short-term, mid-term and long-term. Due to rising interest rates, the long- term went down 12 percent, the mid-term one went down 6 percent, and the short term one went down 2 percent, while the money market fund was up by 2 percent. Obviously, the value of all four positions has changed, which offers a chance to the investor to rebalance the bond funds back to the original allocations.\n\n3. Newer bond ETFs offer the diversification of a bond fund with the maturity date of an individual bond.\n\nETF companies, including BlackRock and Invesco, have developed bond ETFs, both corporate and munis, with maturity dates. I use these to build highly diversified, laddered bond portfolios. They make this last part much easier to execute and understand. An investor can use these ETFs to build out a portfolio with consecutive annual maturities, reinvesting this year's maturing bond ETF into a new one five years out.\n\nIt's often been said that bonds are boring, but this year's declines as the Fed raises rates have made them more exciting \u2014 and frightening. But for most of my clients who invest in them, the boring nature for which bonds can usually be depended on is a good thing.", "The strong U.S. economy's continued success depends largely on infrastructure, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Tuesday.\n\n\"Corporate earnings certainly have been very, very strong. there's no question about that.

He added that the only real obstacle to passing an infrastructure bill is its funding.\n\n\"As you know, [the] president is very keen to have an infrastructure program, and the only real issue is how do you pay for it. How much does the federal government do, how much is done by [the] private sector,\" Ross said.\n\nThe concept of an executive-level infrastructure push has itself become a bit of a laughing matter to critics. In February, President Donald Trump proposed spending $200 billion in a bid to coax $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investing mainly from state and local governments, as well as private entities, but the plan went nowhere.\n\nThe administration's \"Infrastructure Week\" theme also became the butt of jokes.\n\nYet Democratic leaders, such as potential next House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Trump have suggested there could be common ground on a potential infrastructure package.

This includes a refundable tax credit through New York State's Excelsior Program of up to $1.2 billion calculated as a percentage of the salaries Amazon expects to pay employees over the next 10 years, which equates to $48,000 per job for 25,000 jobs with an average wage of over $150,000; and a cash grant from Empire State Development of $325 million based on the square footage of buildings occupied in the next 10 years. Amazon will receive these incentives over the next decade based on the incremental jobs it creates each year and as it reaches building occupancy targets. The company will separately apply for as-of-right incentives including New York City's Industrial & Commercial Abatement Program (ICAP) and New York City's Relocation and Employment Assistance Program (REAP).\n\n\u2014 The community will benefit from New York City providing funding through a Payment In Lieu Of Tax (PILOT) program based on Amazon's property taxes on a portion of the development site to fund community infrastructure improvements developed through input from residents during the planning process. Amazon has agreed to donate space on its campus for a tech startup incubator and for use by artists and industrial businesses, and Amazon will donate a site for a new primary or intermediary public school. The company will also invest in infrastructure improvements and new green spaces.\n\n\"When I took office, I said we would build a new New York State \u2013 one that is fiscally responsible and fosters a business climate that is attractive to growing companies and the industries of tomorrow. We've delivered on those promises and more, and today, with Amazon committing to expand its headquarters in Long Island City, New York can proudly say that we have attracted one of the largest, most competitive economic development investments in U.S. history,\" said Governor Andrew M. Cuomo of New York. \"With an average salary of $150,000 per year for the tens of thousands of new jobs Amazon is creating in Queens, economic opportunity and investment will flourish for the entire region. Amazon understands that New York has everything the company needs to continue its growth. The State's more than $100 billion transportation infrastructure program \u2013 the most ambitious in our history \u2013 combined with our education initiatives like K-12 tech education and the first-in-the-nation Excelsior Scholarship program, will help ensure long-term success and an unrivaled talent pool for Amazon.\"\n\n\"This is a giant step on our path to building an economy in New York City that leaves no one behind. We are thrilled that Amazon has selected New York City for its new headquarters,\" said Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City. \"New Yorkers will get tens of thousands of new, good-paying jobs, and Amazon will get the best talent anywhere in the world. We're going to use this opportunity to open up good careers in tech to thousands of people looking for their foothold in the new economy, including those in City colleges and public housing. The City and State are working closely together to make sure Amazon's expansion is planned smartly, and to ensure this fast growing neighborhood has the transportation, schools, and infrastructure it needs.\"\n\nAmazon in National Landing in Arlington, Virginia\n\n\u2014 National Landing is an urban community in Northern Virginia located less than 3 miles from downtown Washington, D.C. The area is served by 3 Metro stations, commuter rail access, and Reagan National Airport \u2013 all within walking distance. The community has a variety of hotels, restaurants, high-rise apartment buildings, retail, and commercial offices. National Landing has abundant parks and open space with sports and cultural events for residents of all ages throughout the year.\n\n\u2014 As part of Amazon's new headquarters, Virginia and Arlington will benefit from more than 25,000 full-time high-paying jobs; approximately $2.5 billion in Amazon investment; 4 million square feet of energy-efficient office space with the opportunity to expand to 8 million square feet; and an estimated incremental tax revenue of $3.2 billion over the next 20 years as a result of Amazon's investment and job creation.\n\n\u2014 Amazon will receive performance-based direct incentives of $573 million based on the company creating 25,000 jobs with an average wage of over $150,000 in Arlington. This includes a workforce cash grant from the Commonwealth of Virginia of up to $550 million based on $22,000 for each job created over the next 12 years. Amazon will only receive this incentive if it creates the forecasted high-paying jobs. The company will also receive a cash grant from Arlington of $23 million over 15 years based on the incremental growth of the existing local Transient Occupancy Tax, a tax on hotel rooms.\n\n\u2014 The community and Amazon employees will benefit from the Commonwealth investing $195 million in infrastructure in the neighborhood, including improvements to the Crystal City and the Potomac Yards Metro stations; a pedestrian bridge connecting National Landing and Reagan National Airport; and work to improve safety, accessibility, and the pedestrian experience crossing Route 1 over the next 10 years. Arlington will also dedicate an estimated $28 million based on 12% of future property tax revenues earned from an existing Tax Increment Financing (TIF) district for on-site infrastructure and open space in National Landing.\n\n\"This is a big win for Virginia \u2013 I'm proud Amazon recognizes the tremendous assets the Commonwealth has to offer and plans to deepen its roots here,\" said Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia. \"Virginia put together a proposal for Amazon that we believe represents a new model of economic development for the 21st century, and I'm excited to say that our innovative approach was successful. The majority of Virginia's partnership proposal consists of investments in our education and transportation infrastructure that will bolster the features that make Virginia so attractive: a strong and talented workforce, a stable and competitive business climate, and a world-class higher education system.\"\n\n\"We are proud that Amazon has selected National Landing for a major new headquarters. This is, above all, a validation of our community's commitment to sustainability, transit-oriented development, affordable housing, and diversity,\" said Arlington County Board Chair Katie Cristol. \"The strength of our workforce coupled with our proximity to the nation's capital makes us an attractive business location. But Arlington's real strength is the decades of planning that have produced one of the most vibrant, civically engaged communities in the world. Those plans have paved the way for this investment, and we look forward to engaging the Arlington community about Amazon's plans and how we can grow together.\"\n\nAmazon's new Operations Center of Excellence in Nashville\n\n\u2014 Downtown Nashville, along the Cumberland River, is the heart of the city just north of the Gulch and is home to urban living, retail, restaurants, entertainment venues, hospitality, open green spaces, and offices. The area is served by commuter rail, more than a dozen bus routes, and is a 15-minute drive to Nashville International Airport.\n\n\u2014 As part of Amazon's investment, Tennessee, Davidson County and the city of Nashville will benefit from 5,000 full-time, high-paying jobs; over $230 million in investment; 1 million square feet of energy-efficient office space; and an estimated incremental tax revenue of more than $1 billion over the next 10 years as a result of Amazon's investment and job creation.\n\n\u2014 Amazon will receive performance-based direct incentives of up to $102 million based on the company creating 5,000 jobs with an average wage of over $150,000 in Nashville. This includes a cash grant for capital expenditures from the state of Tennessee of $65 million based on the company creating 5,000 jobs over the next 7 years, which is equivalent to $13,000 per job; a cash grant from the city of Nashville of up to $15 million based on $500 for each job created over the next 7 years; and a job tax credit to offset franchise and excise taxes from the state of Tennessee of $21.7 million based on $4,500 per new job over the next 7 years.\n\n\"We want to thank Amazon for its continued investment in the state of Tennessee and are excited about the additional 5,000 corporate jobs they will be creating in Nashville,\" said Governor Bill Haslam of Tennessee. \"It has never been clearer that Tennessee is a great place to do business, and we continue to attract a wide variety of global companies that provide high-paying, quality jobs for our residents.\"\n\n\"Amazon's decision to expand its presence in Nashville is a direct result of the talented workforce and strong community we've built here,\" said Mayor David Briley of Nashville. \"These are quality, high-paying jobs that will boost our economy, provide our workers with new opportunities, and show the rest of the world that Nashville is a premiere location for business investment. We thank Amazon for investing in Nashville, and we look forward to welcoming them to this community.\"\n\nWith more than 610,000 employees worldwide, including over 250,000 in North America, Amazon ranks #1 on American Customer Satisfaction Index, #2 on Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies, #1 on The Harris Poll's Corporate Reputation survey, and #1 on LinkedIn's U.S. Top Companies, a ranking recognizing the most desirable workplaces in the country.

John McCain.\n\nMark Salter, who was a confidant to and co-author for the Republican Arizona lawmaker and Washington icon for decades, responded to Sinema's victory, which became apparent nearly a week after Election Day, by breaking down what it meant for President Donald Trump and the GOP in the state.\n\nRead more: Here are the seven senators most likely to lose their seats in 2020\n\nHis prognosis isn't good for Republicans \u2014 particularly if they tie themselves tightly to Trump, as Sinema's opponent, Martha McSally, did during the campaign.\n\n\"Trump, who barely won AZ two years ago, is even more disliked there now,\" Salter wrote, suggesting it could get worse for the president when he is up for re-election in two years. Salter, like McCain, is known to be critical of Trump.\n\nThe numbers back up Salter's argument about Trump's favorability and performance in the state. According to polling from Morning Consult, Trump had a net positive approval rating of 2 percentage points in Arizona in October, sharply down from 20 in January 2017, when he took office.\n\nTrump won Arizona in 2016 by a margin of about 3.5 percentage points. It was a surprisingly small victory, given that Republicans have a strong presidential track record there. They have won the state in all but one election year dating to 1952. (Bill Clinton edged Bob Dole there in 1996.)", "Amid headlines of turmoil in the stock market, heightened global trade tensions and political tumult, it may seem like the safest place to store your money is in a savings account.\n\nBut actually, just holding your money in cash is a bad idea, according to billionaire hedge fund magnate Ray Dalio.\n\n\"That's the worst thing you could do because it is the surest tax on your money,\" Dalio tells CNBC Make It. \"You will bleed slowly to death, because the after-tax returns are lower than inflation by a little per year.\"\n\nHere's what he means: Over time, inflation causes the goods and services you buy every day to become more expensive relative to the value of the dollars in your wallet. For example, it would take saving over $1,495 in September 2018 (the latest data available) to match the buying power of $1,000 in January of 2000, according to the BLS' Inflation Calculator.\n\nAnd over the long term, inflation becomes increasingly powerful. It would take about $10,742 in September 2018 to match the buying power of $1,000 in January of 1950, according to the calculator.\n\nAlthough you do earn interest on money deposited in a savings account at a bank, the amount is far too low to keep up with the negative impact of inflation, Dalio points out.\n\n\"When you put your money in cash or short-term deposit, look at the interest rate you're getting in relationship to the inflation rate,\" Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, explains. \"You will see that your after tax return will be below the inflation rate. That means that you're experiencing a tax on that [money] equal to that difference. So you can't keep your money in cash. If you think that's safe, you're looking at it wrong \u2014 it's a sure losing strategy.\"\n\nRight now, the national average interest rate for a savings account is only 0.09 percent, according to data from Bankrate. Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index \u2014 which measures inflation \u2014 rose 2.7 percent in the past year.\n\nSince keeping your money in a savings account is a guaranteed way to lose money, you have to turn your savings into investments, Dalio says. Then, your money is growing while you sleep.\n\n\"Over a longer period of time, equities [or stocks] will have a higher return, bonds will have a higher return, real estate will have a higher return than cash,\" he explains. While there are no guarantees in the stock market, from 1928 through 2017, the S&P 500 index produced a 9.8 percent average annualized total return.\n\n\"People with great ideas create productivity and get paid for it,\" Dalio says. \"It is better to invest in productivity than to not invest in productivity, because otherwise your money will lose buying power.\"\n\nDon't miss: Billionaire Ray Dalio remembers the moment he saw the financial crisis coming: 'This is the big one'\n\nLike this story?

However, Washington has not yet settled separate battles with Beijing and Brussels.\n\nOn Monday, Bloomberg News reported that President Trump plans to meet with his trade team to discuss a draft report on tariffs for European autos.

Ford's sales in China dropped 43 percent in September over the same month in 2017.\n\nThe drop is due partly to a slowdown in sales across the industry and partly to problems unique to Ford.\n\nOne major factor hurting sales is a government crackdown on certain forms of lending that made credit available to a wide swath of buyers in China's middle class, especially in its growing second-tier cities, said Michael Dunne, CEO of ZoZoGo, a firm that advises automakers on doing business in the country.\n\nChina had for some time allowed peer-to-peer lending schemes, where wealthier people could lend money to the less wealthy. But the recent crackdown on such practices has shut down several companies facilitating the process and left those remaining lenders skittish, along with many consumers, Dunne said.\n\nHowever, Ford has been hit particularly hard, while U.S. rival General Motors seems to have fared well in the face of those challenges.\n\nFord's product line in China is a bit stale, and has failed to keep up with the rapidly changing demand in the country, said IHS Markit analyst Stephanie Brinley, who follows the automotive industry.\n\n\"Ford is in a unique situation to the degree that they really did have a product problem,\" she said. \"That market wants to see fresh product faster, and Ford just wasn't delivering it. It is not that their products were inherently bad, it is just that they weren't updating them fast enough for what the market wants.

The press secretary received even more criticism after she tweeted a video of the exchange, which The Washington Post and other outlets said was doctored. That video was first shared by a right-wing commentator associated with conspiracy theory website Infowars, the Post reported.\n\nLater that week, Trump appeared to discard the notion that Acosta had inappropriately placed his hands on the intern \u2014 the reason stated by Trump's administration for revoking the pass in the first place.\n\nAcosta \"was not nice to that young woman,\" Trump said in remarks to reporters Friday, but \"I don't hold him for that because it wasn't overly, you know, horrible.\"\n\nCNN is asking the court for a preliminary injunction that would reinstate Acosta's press credentials as soon as possible.\n\n\"While the suit is specific to CNN and Acosta, this could have happened to anyone,\" CNN said in a statement Tuesday morning. \"If left unchallenged, the actions of the White House would create a dangerous chilling effect for any journalist who covers our elected officials.\"\n\nMinutes after the lawsuit was reported Tuesday morning, White House Correspondents' Association President Olivier Knox offered a statement of support for the media outlet.\n\n\"Revoking access to the White House complex amounted to disproportionate reaction to the events of last Wednesday.

They were in town for press meetings during the day before heading to Palo Alto to meet with employees at SAP's Silicon Valley office.\n\nSAP, which specializes in enterprise resource management software, had been in casual talks for several months with Qualtrics. In late summer, McDermott had lunch with Ryan Smith, his brother and co-founder, Jared, and Scott at Marea, an Italian restaurant in midtown Manhattan. They talked about entrepreneurship, building a business and some areas where their companies overlap. SAP serves critical software to the world's biggest companies, and Qualtrics, at a much smaller scale, sells software to help companies understand and retain their customers and employees.\n\n\"We really weren't in M&A discussions at that point,\" McDermott said. \"We were like-minded individuals, very cloud oriented, very growth oriented. I'm obsessed with customers. Ryan is obsessed with their experiences.\"\n\nSometimes a lunch is just a lunch. And while McDermott was running a company with 95,000 people across the globe, Smith was working full speed towards an IPO.\n\nQualtrics hired Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to lead its offering and publicly filed its prospectus in October.

From 39,000 feet in the air, he called Smith with a proposal. He wanted to see if Smith would be willing to pass up a Nasdaq listing and join forces with SAP. At the time, investors were clamoring for shares in a company that was likely to be valued at between $5 billion and $6 billion and, given how cloud software companies trade, was almost guaranteed to pop in its debut.", "Real friendship is the key to our long-term career success, health and happiness.

Those with few friends said they felt lonely either very often or always and disengaged in their work. Almost two-thirds said they would be more inclined to stay at their company longer if they had more friends. This is especially true for millennials, who consider their manager as their work parent and their co-workers their work family.\n\nA separate study, by Officevibe, found that 70 percent of employees say friends at work is the most crucial element to a happy working life, and 58 percent of men would refuse a higher-paying job if it meant not getting along with co-workers.", "Check out the companies making headlines before the bell:\n\nAmazon \u2014 Amazon has picked New York City and Northern Virginia as the sites for its additional headquarters, according to multiple reports.

Electricity will account for a quarter of energy used by end users such as consumers and industry by 2040, it said.\n\nCoal and renewables will swap their positions in the power generation mix.\n\nThe share of coal is forecast to fall from about 40 percent today to a quarter in 2040 while renewables would grow to just over 40 percent from a quarter now.\n\nEnergy-related carbon dioxide emissions will continue to grow at a slow but steady pace to 2040. From 2017 levels, the IEA said CO2 emissions would rise by 10 percent to 36 gigatonnes in 2040, mostly driven by growth in oil and gas.\n\nThis trajectory was \"far out of step\" with what scientific knowledge says would be required to tackle climate change, the report said.\n\nWATCH:Here's what drives the price of oil", "\"I think there may be a dialogue around some potential second steps, but I think the bulk, the core of what's being proposed will stay the same.\"\n\n\"I don't expect the Italian government to make any substantial revisions,\" Lorenzo Fioramonti, a junior minister for the Five Star Movement and one of the architects of the party's economic policy, told CNBC's Willem Marx.\n\n\"I think there may be a dialogue around some potential second steps, but I think the bulk, the core of what's being proposed will stay the same,\" Fioramonti said, suggesting the ongoing exchanges between Brussels and Rome are more about what will happen next, rather than the actual content of the budget.\n\nItalian news media suggested the government could alter its growth forecasts in order to bring them more in line with the commission's.

Let's start with home. Twenty years ago, Gordon Brown, the then chancellor of the U.K., gave the Bank of England its much-needed independence. Market commentators jumped to applaud this move, and newspapers screamed with headlines of the \"Old Lady\" being set free. But subsequent governments have constantly tried meddling with the central bank's policies, with the BOE often finding itself walking on a tightrope.\n\nThe trend is not just limited to the U.K. In the past few years, there have been innumerable examples of governments encroaching into this space. Central banks across the world are struggling to keep politics out of their day-to-day functioning. The U.S. Federal Reserve is a classic example of this.\n\nIn July this year, U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the Fed for increasing interest-rates and later admitting that he \"maybe\" regretted appointing Jerome Powell as Fed chairman. Last month, Trump continued his tirade against the Fed when he blamed the central bank's policy decisions for a sharp market decline. \"The Fed is going loco and there's no reason for them to do it. I'm not happy about it,\" Trump told Fox News in a televised interview. While the government is well within its rights to question the central bank, the trouble starts to brew when they look to influence decisions.\n\nAnother example is India where a recent standoff between Narendra Modi-led government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has led to speculation that the current governor Urijit Patel may look to resign. This came days after the RBI's deputy governor said undermining a central bank's independence could be \"potentially catastrophic.\"\n\nIn another dramatic move, Turkey's currency went tumbling after President Erdogan put his son-in-law in charge of economic policies in June this year. The list goes on with countries like Russia, Nigeria, South Africa and Argentina often seeing their governments meddling with central bank's policies.\n\nHanding control of the central bank to the government will be foolish. However, ever since the financial crisis, a lot of attention has turned to central bank policies and their impact on the general consumer, making it more and more tough for them to escape constant questioning and meddling \u2013 whether they like it or not.", "The oil market is 'in for volatile times,' analyst says\n\n12:37 AM ET Tue, 13 Nov 2018\n\nVirendra Chauhan of Energy Aspects discusses the oil market and the various geopolitical factors playing into oil prices.", "Major oil producing countries in the Middle East and its neighbors might benefit from higher crude prices in 2019, according to the latest outlook from International Monetary Fund (IMF), but there are numerous uncertainties in the region.\n\nThe Fund's latest regional economic outlook for the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan (MENAP) region, published Tuesday, warns that \"multiple and intertwined risks cloud the outlook of the MENAP region.\"\n\n\"These include a faster-than-anticipated tightening of global financial conditions, escalating trade tensions that could affect global growth and hurt key MENAP trading partners, geopolitical strains, and spillovers from regional conflicts,\" the report stated.\n\nThese risks could trigger a deterioration in financial market sentiment and greater financial market volatility, the Fund said, \"aggravating the financing challenges for countries with high levels of debt or large refinancing needs.\"\n\nOil producing countries in the Middle East have traditionally relied on oil exports as their source of government revenue. Volatility in oil markets amid imbalances in supply and demand have prompted a number of countries, particularly in the Gulf, to look to diversify their economies away from oil and to create more jobs in other sectors of the economy. In its latest summary on the MENAP region's outlook, it encouraged countries to commit to further reforms.\n\n\"The outlook and the rising risks underscore the need to intensify efforts to raise growth to levels that generate enough jobs for the benefit of all,\" the IMF said. \"In this context, countries should expand access to finance, strengthen governance, improve education outcomes, and enhance labor market flexibility, particularly in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).\"\n\nTo ensure that future fiscal adjustment is as growth-friendly and equitable as possible, the Fund said countries need to both prioritize expenditure on \"growth-enhancing and high-quality investment in human capital and physical infrastructure, while sustaining well-targeted social spending.\" It also advocated a move to a more progressive tax structure to diversify the governments' revenue bases.\n\nJihad Azour, director of the Middle East and Central Asia at the IMF, told CNBC on Tuesday that the MENAP report comes amid an uncertain global growth outlook.\n\n\"Global conditions are changing in terms of the risk metrics,\" Azour told CNBC's Dan Murphy. \"Although we're still enjoying a high level of growth, that growth is plateauing,\" he added.", "The IMF forecasts global growth for 2018-2019 to remain steady at its 2017 level of 3.7 percent, but the growth outlook for a number of major economies has been marked down.\n\nIn the United States, while the real GDP growth outlook for 2018 is unchanged at 2.9 percent, the forecast for 2019 has been revised down to 2.5 percent due to the recently announced trade measures.\n\nThe United States has entered a serious tariff dispute with China, and it remains unclear how long that conflict will last.\n\nThe outlook for emerging and developing economies is also weaker, reflecting downward revisions for some large emerging market economies due to country-specific factors, tighter financial conditions, geopolitical tensions and higher oil prices, according to the report.\n\n\"Real GDP in the Euro area will slow to 1.9 percent in 2019, compared to 2.9 percent in 2018.

Each brand will have its own mini store inside an 11,000-square-foot space, with new retailers funneling in and out each year. The mall owner says it will provide fixtures like shelving, data on foot traffic, radio-frequency identification tagging for inventory, marketing and even help finding staffing \u2014 the retailers simply need to show up and pay rent.\n\nThe rollout of BrandBox comes as more than 140 million square feet of retail space has been shuttered across the U.S. in malls and shopping centers already this year, according to real estate research group CoStar. That's easily more than the 105 million square feet of space that closed in 2017. Closures by Sears and Toys R Us are leaving a blank canvas at many malls for new uses like these so-called pint-sized and modern-day department stores.\n\nMacerich plans to take BrandBox to its malls in Santa Monica, California, Philadelphia and Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nThe idea could eventually end up at all of its U.S. malls in some way. It also envisions adding multiple BrandBox locations inside some shopping centers, where there's more demand for smaller retailers over department stores.\n\n\"I think what we're learning as an industry is that we need to have modular space that can be reconfigured,\" Macerich Chief Digital Officer Kevin McKenzie told CNBC. The physical walls within each BrandBox will be movable, he said. Sometimes two companies might fill the space, sometimes seven.\n\nDKNY, an already established fashion brand, will also be inside BrandBox at Tysons Corner Center at launch to test a new concept. McKenzie said the space can be a way for even traditional retailers to try out a new market before investing in establishing a permanent presence there.\n\nThe space also can help retailers born online come to life, which is a key goal of the undertaking, according to McKenzie.\n\n\"These companies don't have the real estate groups like Lululemon has, Tesla has or Apple has,\" he said. \"Traditionally you get a broker, a store designer and a lawyer. You figure out what technology you want to put in. There's a lot of things that can go wrong that these companies can't afford.\"\n\nBrands are appreciative of the real estate and the perks.\n\n\"We view BrandBox as a safe environment to test our brand in a mall environment,\" said Matt Scanlan, co-founder and CEO of Naadam.

Similar to The Gathering Shops, Fourpost will offer its tenants fixtures, Wi-Fi and point-of-sale hardware to make the move from the web to bricks-and-mortar retail as painless as possible. Fourpost's investors include Warby Parker co-founder Dave Gilboa and Parachute founder Ariel Kaye, putting the concept in good hands with already well-established e-commerce brands.\n\n\"This is disrupting the department store model,\" Ghermezian said. \"I want it to be like you are walking through story by story, getting that individual experience on a per-brand basis.\"\n\nAnother company that bills itself as \"a new type of department store\" \u2014 Neighborhood Goods \u2014 opens in a shopping center in Plano, Texas this month.

But here we're doing something very positive, the economy and finances are recovering, it's much less now that it was when we took over and we have only six months, so that should be taken into considerations by the rating agencies.\n\n\n\nSri: Rating agencies do say that Malaysia is too dependent on oil revenues, and not enough has been done in terms of significant revenue raising policies? How would you respond to that, Prime Minister?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: We're not dependent on oil revenues. You see, we're a small producer of oil, 600K barrels a day, nothing compared to countries like Saudi which is entirely dependent upon oil revenue. We have other sources of revenue, we produce a lot of palm oil which used to fetch good prices. 82% of our exports is made up of manufactured goods, so how can you say we're dependent upon oil revenue. It's not.\n\n\n\nSri: The issue seems to be, Prime minister, GST - zero-rated. That was one of the actions your administration took when you were elected. The issue seems to be revenue generation and filling that shortfall. What's been done to fill that GST shortfall?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: We have introduced SST: sales and services tax (Sri: is that enough?) It's enough, it's more than enough. Actually the figure given about the revenue from GST was inflated, money that should be returned to the tax payers were included as revenue, put into the consolidated account, that is wrong. Actually it's not 40 billion, it's about 25 billion. And from that SST, we can get 25billion, so it's not affecting us at all.\n\nSri: How confident are you that fiscal deficit comes down to 3-percent of GDP by 2020? That's your target. What's been done to achieve this? And how confident are you that this target will be met?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: If you take the real figures during the previous regime, you will find that the figure was extremely high. Now it's 3.7% and I think we can bring it down further. But of course the fact is that the previous government borrowed huge sums of money, we have to pay interest on that, we have to pay the money that we borrowed and that of course affects our ability to attend to other issues. We're not... we're still able to pay salaries and things like that, but we have to cut back on development. That is all.\n\n\n\nSri: According to Bank Negara's figures and this is a figure that I've read in the Malaysian press. Total public debt stands in the region of 983.6 billion ringgit as of the second quarter. That is, in the region of almost 71% of annual GDP? What are your reflections on that figure?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: Well, it was 1.2 ... 1.3 trillion before. So if it is 900billion now, it is already a good reduction of some 300billion ringgit. So we think the situation has improved. But one has to take into consideration that the amount of money that was borrowed before. If you don't pay, all you can ... other ways is to hide. We're not hiding. We're telling what's the truth about the borrowing.\n\n\n\nSri: What that is the extend of the inherited debt, if I can put it that way, the liabilities that were inherited by your administration by the Najib-era administration?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: In terms of the absolute number, it's about 1.2 trillion. That's a big number.\n\n\n\nSri: You do believe that the ratings agencies have taken account of this number or they should take account of this number?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: The previous regime mentioned a figure of about 600billion or 700billion. And rating agencies apparently accepted their figures. When we took over the government, we found that the amount of money borrowed was much more than that. It was 1.2 trillion dollars, so the figure of course is quite different, the ratings should be different.\n\n\n\nSri: And on that basis, do you believe that you can, sovereign Malaysia, can avoid downgrade, because they recognize or should recognize the extent of the inherited debt?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: They should recognize that, inherited debt. They should also recognize the fact that we have been able to reduce the amount. Everybody knows that we're not going ahead with huge projects like the high-speed rail and also the East coast Railway.\n\n\n\nSri: And you can avoid the downgrade? Malaysia can avoid the downgrade you believe?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: We can avoid downgrade if the rating agencies take into consideration the success of our ability to reduce the amount of loans from 1.2 trillion to about 900 billion.\n\n\n\nSri: Prime minister, how high are the downside risks to Malaysia economy in 2019 considering the deepening trade conflict?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: If you are going to xxx a figure, that I can't do. What I can say if the figure now is not as high as it was before we took over.\n\n\n\nSri: Do you think that the downside risks are higher in 2019 because of the trade conflict? Malaysia seems to be very exposed given the export dependency - almost 70% of the GDP, if I am not mistaken.\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: Yes we are in a way very exposed because we're a trading nation. Or economy is based on what we export and what we import; therefore whatever happens to the markets affect us. But it has not so far affected us to the point where we cannot manage the government, we can still keep up the wages and all that, we can pay. Really development expenditure is reduced.\n\n\n\nSri: What's the risk of that Malaysian economic growth falls below 4.5% in 2019?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: That's not much of a risk. I think we will do better than that.\n\n\n\nSri: External conditions are very challenging right now.\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: Yes, it is so, but we have been very resilient. We have faced many crises before, and we have learnt from our experience of handling crisis.\n\n\n\nSri: Are you worried about currency depreciation? Given the fact that US Dollars remains quite strong. U.S. Fed is committed to gradual pace of tightening.\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: Unless there is deliberate trade in currencies that tends to fiddle with the ratings, I think our currency will not depreciate that much.\n\n\n\nSri: Do you think the trade conflict between the U.S. and China which seems to be really at the heart of some rather bleak forecasts from the IMF, for 2019 beyond, do you think that trade conflict is going to be prolonged in nature? Are we going to see an economic cold war or even, and the situation that lasts years and not months before it is resolved?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: It all depends on whether Mr. Trump remains the President of the United States. As you can see from the mid-terms elections, he has not fared so well. The chances of him getting a second term is a bit, oh well, bleak at the moment. If Trump is not there, I think the other members of the U.S. government, whether they be republican or Democrats, they will not continue with this very disruptive trade war.\n\n\n\nSri: So it is your belief, Prime Minister, that President Trump will not be elected, re-elected in 2020?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: I will be surprised if he's re-elected after what his poor showing in the midterm election. And the comments that we hear among Americans as to his performance. He's very fond of dismissing people. He is accused of getting Russian help during the election. In order to stop people from investigating, he has sacked people. That kind of thing doesn't bear a good future for him.\n\n\n\nSri: In the near term, how confident are you that there will be any kind of breakthrough or any kind of compromise on this trade conflict between the U.S. and China when Mr. Xi and President Trump meet as expected on the sidelines of the G20 summit at the Buenos Aires?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: With Trump, you can't predict anything. We don't know how he will react. We never expected him to meet the President of North Korea, but then he met. He was patting his back, he was so friendly yet at one time he says he didn't want to meet. So with Trump, you can't predict.\n\n\n\nSri: Oil prices are currently trading in the low 70s - low 70 dollars a barrel. That cannot be good for Malaysia from a revenue sustainability point of view.\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: Better than 40 dollars. It was 40 dollars at one time and everybody suffered. But now at 70 dollars we are much better off than at 40 dollars. There is a possibility that oil prices will go up.\n\n\n\nSri: And you don't expect oil prices remain depressed in 2019 given the global headwinds, given the downside risks to the global economy, the trade war, the effect that's going to have on global demand?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: When oil price hit 80 dollar, there was talks about 100 dollar per barrel price. So people are really unable to predict things. For me to predict the future is something that is beyond me.\n\n\n\nSri: What's OPEC's role in this? Should they take actions to stabilize the price of oil and cut production when they meet in December?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: OPEC is not effective. They are always at loggerheads with each other, so they cannot make decision. What is important the production of shale oil from America.\n\n\n\nSri: Why do you believe that's important? Is it because increasingly the U.S. is being perceived as the swing producer, not Saudi?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: The only problem with U.S. is the environment and the people who are concerned about the pollution caused by shale ... extracting oil from shale.\n\n\n\nSri: And if we can bring the conversation about oil back to Malaysia. Establishing a sovereign wealth fund, I am not talking about a political slush fund. What's been done to create a fund for Malaysia's oil wealth that provides for the longer-term security and benefit of the nation, and is the Norwegian model, Prime Minister, an appropriate one for Malaysia?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: The Malaysia oil business, although it's 100% owned by the government, is not managed like other sovereign oil companies. In other cases, they were only interested in collecting royalties. We have gone in the, all the the different aspects of the oil industry. We're producing oil, we are also consuming oil. We are very big in gas production. So I think Malaysia will not feel as severely as other people because we're not just a producer, collecting ... we are not just depending on the collection of royalty. We are producing oil in other countries, not only in Malaysia. And there are prospects of our producing gas in Canada for example that we will give us which will give us very good return.\n\n\n\nSri: That is one topic we will end here, that is the trade, the economy etc. I will move to the domestic political scene. Prime Minister, let's talk about the transition. And let me start by asking you how long you are going to be Prime Minister of Malaysia for?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: Well, I have promised that I will step down after 2 years or so. And I will keep my promise. But of course lots of things can be done in two years; but lots more need to be done. So it's up to my successor to deal with it. But as far as I can see, 6 months after taking over, we have cleaned up the government; We have already improved the financial situations. So it looks like we can improve further, we're working like ... getting Japanese Yen loan and things like that. This will contribute to our efforts to reduce the amount of loans that we have to bear.\n\n\n\nSri: Would you consider stepping down earlier than 2020?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: If the people want me to step down earlier, I have no problem.\n\n\n\nSri: What would have to change for you to consider stepping down before 2020, Prime Minister?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: If people were to tell me that I'm not performing, I will step down. No problem.\n\n\n\nSri: Who, in your opinion, is worthy potential successor to yourself? Is it Mr. Anwar? And another name has been mentioned, and that is Azmin Ali.\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: Well, anybody can be. But the promise is that if I step down or when I step down. Anwar will succeed me. That was a promise, that was undertaking of the party.\n\n\n\nSri: And you 've said if the people want Anwar Ibrahim as prime minister, they are entitled to have him. Does that imply that there will be a popular vote? Or what exactly would be the process under the Malaysia constitution that will decide the next Prime Minister, your successor?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: We still believe in democracy and the rights of the people to choose their leader, their government.\n\n\n\nSri: So there wouldn't be some popular vote, would there?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: If they want do, they can do that. But what happens is that as a party, as a coalition, we promise that, but it doesn't bind the people.\n\n\n\nSri: Does it bother you that there is something of a leadership struggle emerging within PKR? the largest party in Pakatan Harapan coalition?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: There is a struggle at the lower level, at the second level. As far as their leader is concerned, there is no dispute.\n\n\n\nSri: But this doesn't point towards divided government, in anyway?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: Well, we will have to see. I am not good at predicting the future.\n\n\n\nSri: Well, let's talk about reforming institutions. And let's talk about the legacy of 1MDB, and closure. It is alleged that Malaysia financier Jho Low masterminded the 1MDB fraud. Just bring us up to speed, prime minister with where you believe he is, wh is it taking such a long time to locate him? And for him to answer these claims in the court of law in Malaysia?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: We suspect that he's in China, but China has denied. So we are in no position to prove that the denial is without basis, so we have to accept that. He is a man with many passports, he can move around, he has shown that he can move around quite easily in the past, maybe he's hiding somewhere.\n\n\n\nSri: It's been alleged that Jho Low helped engineer some of China infrastructure deals that your government froze, the China infrastructure deals under the Najib era. Is there any truth to that?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: I think there is some truth, because he has tremendous influence over the prime minister. You know this new book that has come out (Sri: Billion Dollar Whale) There are many...many stories about how he managed to influence decision simply by calling up the prime minister.\n\n\n\nSri: Can Jho Low be guaranteed a fair trial if he comes back to Malaysia?\n\n\n\nDr Mahathir: There will be a fair trial. I must admit that in the previous regime there is an attempt to fiddle with the judiciary, but we want a fair judiciary. And we hope that there will not be bias.\n\nSri: Can you say the same for the former prime minister? Can he be guaranteed a fair trial?\n\nDr. Mahathir: Yes, we will get a fair trial.\n\n\n\nSri: Ultimately, is it your intention to see him and those who have aided and betted the alleged fraud at 1MDB sentenced and serving jail time? Is that what Malaysia needs to achieve real closure on this story?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: We believe in the rule of law. Whatever the law says, we accept. If he has to be tried, he should be tried, if he's charged and he's found guilty, then the rule of law will apply. If he's found innocent, then the rule of law will also apply.\n\n\n\nSri: Has any date been set for Najib's trial?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: Judge fixed the date in February next year.\n\n\n\nSri: Will you allow international observers?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: Yes, Yes. Anybody can come and see. We are open.\n\n\n\nSri: And if you can talk about Goldman Sachs. Revelations are emerging now about the involvement of Goldman, the underwriting of 1MDB bonds, former Goldman partner, Tim Leissner, who pledged guilty to conspiring to laud the money etc. Is it safe to say that Goldman Sachs will never be permitted to do business in Malaysia again? Are they persona non grata in your country?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: We are watching. Of course, there is evidence that Goldman Sachs has done things which were wrong. They shouldn't have done that, but we want to see the results of all these investigations and the actions taken against Leissner for example.\n\n\n\nSri: What does this tell you about compliance control at Goldman Sachs?\n\n\n\nDr. M: It doesn't work very well.\n\n\n\nSri: And Malaysia seeking restitution from Goldman as well? How much could we be talking about, Prime Minister?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: I don't know the exact amount. But obviously we have been cheated through the compliance by Goldman Sachs people.\n\n\n\nSri: Institutional reform, do you admit that corruption existed during your administration.\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: Corruption is found in every country at any period of time, but it is the extent that is the important.\n\n\n\nSri: But do you admit that it happened during your watch?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: There was corruption I believe, but what we can detect we detect. But the kind of corruption you see during Najib's team was not seen during my term.\n\nSri: So what guarantee can you give Malaysia public that you can start the eradication of abuse of power that happened in prior governments, your own government, and former Prime Minister Najib's government? What guarantees can you give, here and now, to the Malaysia people that you have started the process to eradicate corruption?\n\nDr. Mahathir: We have reduced the power of PM for example, he can serve only two terms. And most of the decision-making is now transferred to parliament.\n\n\n\nSri: How long do you think you have to go before you can truly say that you have meaningfully reformed the institutions in Malaysia?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: I think even now people don't talk anymore about corruption in Malaysia. There can be corruption but certainly on the scale that is so obvious to the public.\n\n\n\nSri: Prime Minister let's move on to foreign relations. One of the first things that you did when you were elected was review the Najib-era Chinese infrastructure deals. You visited Beijing this year too. Have those deals been restructured on more favorable terms or are they completely abandoned now?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: It does not reflect on China, it reflects on Najib. It is Najib who decided to have the railway for example. It was he who decided to borrow $55bn and all that. So we are blaming Najib. Our relationship with China is normal, like before. But it is getting at Najib. In the process of course it may involve some contracts entered into with Chinese companies.\n\n\n\nSri: But are those deals being restructured? Are they more transparent and are they more economically viable? And have they been restructured on more economically favorable terms?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: On the East Coast Railway for example we have stopped the work on this because they have overpaid the contractor because of the terms of the previous contract was that they paid equity to the timetable without regard for the work done. So that has been stopped, so we are now considering deferment or some other solution to the railway construction, because we feel that at this moment we cannot afford.\n\n\n\nSri: How would you describe economic relations with China?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: Very good. China is still our best and biggest trading partner\n\n\n\nSri: Are you pivoting more towards Japan as the preferred provider of FDI?\n\n\n\nDr. Mahathir: We are friendly with all countries in the world. Any country that is beneficial for us in terms of being a good market for us, we will do our best to be friendly with them. The fact that we are friendly with Japan does not reflect on our friendliness with China.\n\n\n\nSri: Malaysia has been named one of the potential beneficiaries of the trade conflict and by that I mean companies doing business in China - they could be Chinese companies - are looking at relocating their supply chain to South East Asia because of the trade conflict. Are you seeing any evidence of that transfer happening towards Malaysia?\n\nDr. Mahathir: Nothing is yet happening but that is one of the possibilities. We are hoping that if the people want to produce things to sell to the U.S., it should be better to invest in Malaysia and other countries than in China, at this moment.\n\nSri: And this recent tussle that occurred between your country and China and any bad blood that occurred during that renegotiation process, that's not jeopardizing any of that inflow?\n\nDr. Mahathir: There's no bad blood between us and China. I was there, I was received very well by them, I had the full series of negotiations and they were very forthright, very friendly.\n\nSri: Why is it taking Malaysia so long, Prime Minister, to ratify the CPTPP?\n\nDr. Mahathir: Because it may affect our domestic business and politics.\n\nSri: So in other words taking down the trade barriers, that may create inequalities of wealth and that's what you're worried about? Can you just elaborate on why the process is taking so long?\n\nDr. Mahathir: It is a negotiation of countries with unequal status of development. Obviously when you bring down borders, the people with the goods to cross the borders will benefit the most. The richer countries can then enter into the poorer countries. The poorer countries don't have much to sell except probably raw materials. And that too is controlled by market forces. For example, tin. The tin market has been - not manipulated - has been in London all this while. I mean we have no say until now. It is the country with the biggest amount of things to export who will benefit most from bringing down borders. But what do we get in return, that is the question that we must ask ourselves.\n\nSri: Do you simply need more time to sell this proposition to the Malaysian public?\n\nDr. Mahathir: There are lots of protests in the country about entering into this agreement because many people feel that it's not beneficial for the country.\n\nSri: And where does Malaysia stand in terms of the negotiations with another very major trade deal and that is the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership?\n\nDr. Mahathir: Well we are still studying it to see whether there are any negative things about that trade negotiation\n\nSri: And is it potentially the same set of issues that is delaying the ratification of CPTPP that are delaying RCEP as well? You're worried about inequality?\n\nDr. Mahathir: Malaysia is a developing country. In addition to that we have a multi-racial population and the multiracial population do not have equal distribution in terms of wealth. So we need to avoid these disparities in our country and the racial problem. Whenever we enter into negotiations with other countries, because other countries will be thinking only about trade, we have to think about our domestic politics.\n\nSri: Racial politics has been an incredibly divisive issue for your country. How can you ever begin that process of \u2026 how can I describe this diplomatically \u2026 harmonizing or reforming maybe I should say \u2026 race-based politics in Malaysia?\n\nDr. Mahathir: That's what some people say. But we have managed racial politics much better than other countries. In many countries when they became independent, they expelled foreigners. Indians were expelled from Myanmar, from Fuji, from Tanganyika and other places. We, on the other hand, allowed people of foreign origin to stay in our country, we give them scholarships, they are able to retain their language, to have schools, etc. So we have managed our racial relations much better than other countries to the point where Malaysia is very stable. And only once was there any racial complaint.\n\nSri: But the Bumiputera policy, you are open to reforming it? It's going to be a very long process but you are open to reforming it?\n\nDr. Mahathir: I mean you have to understand what the Bumiputera policy is all about. In even a single ethnic country, if there is a huge disparity between rich and poor, there will be revolution, there will be civil war. But in Malaysia that can be amplified by racial differences. So we have to be very careful about this. That we have managed to keep the country stable and peaceful is something that people should appreciate because normally in a multi-racial country there will be fights. Even a multi-religious country like Northern Ireland you see how long it took them? And of course in the Arab countries you see a lot of things like that.\n\nSri: It's a very fine balance. ASEAN. What's your message, Prime Minister, to this 33rd ASEAN Summit?\n\nDr. Mahathir: ASEAN has tremendous potential. But we are countries of people with different ethnic and racial groups. And our economic performance is not at the same level. Europe I think is much more able to overcome these differences in economic advancement. But ASEAN -- you see great disparities between the members. We need I think for example to ensure that whatever we do, we do observe the development of the least developed countries in the ASEAN region. But what is important is that ASEAN is a very big entity. It has more than 600 million people. 600 million people, even if they are poor they form a good market. We need to look inside our markets and to find ways and means where we can help the less-developed country catch up with those.\n\nSri: Does it bother you that President Trump won't be attending this ASEAN summit?\n\nDr. Mahathir: It doesn't bother me.\n\nSri: And why is that?\n\nDr. Mahathir: Because I don't know what he's going to say. And he's not committed.\n\nSri: And what's your message to Aung San Suu Kyi? Because you've made it very clear your position on the Rohingya matter. Have you lost faith in Aung San Suu Kyi?\n\nDr. Mahathir: When Malaysia became independent we gave citizenship to people who were obviously of foreign origin. We made them citizens, they became a part of the government, there was less discrimination, only some discrimination on certain issues. But Myanmar cannot even allow people who have been there for 800 years. They have been there. And in fact when Myanmar was formed, actually by the British, the British set up a single government to govern the area they called Burma. But inside Burma were these Rohingya. They are not foreigner. They are people who were living there.\n\nSri: Do you support her anymore? And if you don't support her, what does that mean from the standpoint of diplomatic relations, foreign relations between Malaysia and Myanmar?\n\nDr. Mahathir: Well, we still continue with our diplomatic relations, but we feel very unhappy indeed with the behavior of Myanmar.\n\nSri: Singapore-Malaysia relations. How rocky are they, Prime Minister?\n\nDr. Mahathir: Well neighbours, who compete with each other, we have some tough crisis and problems, but we can resolve these problem. It's not going to lead to confrontation or violence of any kind. But obviously when you are competing, there are times when you win, sometimes when you lose and sometimes there will be disappointment or even satisfaction with the relation.\n\nSri: The two-year deferment of the high-speed rail link has been worked out. Can you guarantee from your side that there will be no more delays to the HSR project beyond 2020?\n\nDr. Mahathir: Well we said two years and we hope to be able to recover enough to have the money to finance a new line. But is it necessary that we should continue with something that was costly and perhaps not as give-return as we expect.\n\nSri: And Prime Minister can we finish our conversation by asking you to offer a few words on the situation in the Middle East. How concerned are you about deeper political stability in that region?\n\nDr. Mahathir: The problem with the Middle East is a refusal to recognize the problem. You see, before there was no problem in the Middle East. The whole area was ruled by Turkey at one time and they were not fighting each other. Syria for example was one country, it is now divided into five countries now. All these things were perpetrated by the British and the French, dividing up. And then on the top of that they decided to take land belonging to the Arabs and give it to the Jews because they had a Jewish problem. Their solution to the holocaust is to take other people's land and give it to the Jews. There were 94% Arabs in Palestine at that time. Naturally they are very angry. Unless you attend to that, the problem, the frustration felt by the Arabs and find ways to stop them from feeling that way, you will not solve the problem of the Middle East.\n\nSri: Have relations between Malaysia and Saudi Arabia changed since the killing of Jamal Khashoggi?\n\nDr. Mahathir: Our relations with Saudi Arabia is not influence by just one issue. We are really unwilling to be associated with wars. And currently Saudi Arabia is fighting a war with Yemen and we cannot have our troops there, because people may suspect that we are helping Saudi fight a war in Yemen. That is our main problem. Of course the Khashoggi thing has come up and if it is true then I think\u2026\n\nSri: And there is a historically severe famine in Yemen. And it's cost the lives of thousands of Yemenese. Proxy wars continue in Syria. What role can Malaysia play as a Muslim country to stop the killing?\n\nDr. Mahathir: Preach Islam. Because Islam does not promote those things. They are doing things against the teachings of Islam. They have forgotten their religion. They are being lured, they are being led by the sentiments, the leadership of their leaders. They do not follow their Muslim religion, they follow their leaders. That's why these things happen.\n\nSri: Prime Minister, I'm very grateful for your time today.\n\nDr. Mahathir: You're welcome.\n\nSri: Thank you very much. Thank you.\n\nEND\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nClarence Chen\n\nCommunications Manager APAC, CNBC International\n\nD: +65 6326 1123\n\nM: +65 9852 8630\n\nclarence.chen@cnbc.com\n\nAbout CNBC\n\nCNBC is the leading global broadcaster of live business and financial news and information, reporting directly from the major financial markets around the globe with regional headquarters Singapore, London and New York.

Amazon has said it will invest more than $5 billion over almost two decades to expand its 613,000-strong workforce by 50,000.\n\nThat build-out will offer opportunities aplenty for the tens of thousands of techies who dream of working at the e-commerce behemoth. But with the new roles offering average salaries of $150,000, and the typical Amazon job posting receiving thousands of applications, competition is set to be fierce.\n\nSo, it's important to figure out how you can get ahead of the crowd.\n\nOne person who understands that better than most is Sandi Lin. Between 2011 and 2013, she conducted thousands of interviews at the company's Seattle HQ in her role as an Amazon \"bar raiser.\"\n\nThe position, which is held in addition to an employee's regular role, is designed to make sure every new hire raise the talent bar across the company, while ensuring a fair final decision-making process. The idea is that they can provide a layer of objectivity to the hiring process in departments outside of their own, Amazon confirmed to CNBC Make It.\n\n\"It's sort of like a secret society,\" said Lin, noting that employees can express an interest in the role, but typically they're \"tapped\" for it.\n\nUsually only half of the employees who join the three-month program make it through to become an official bar raiser. But, for those who do, it provides a unique insight into the Amazon interview process, as Lin explained to CNBC Make It.\n\nThat process can be broken down into four main steps:", "She is the first woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate from the state of Arizona and the first Democrat that the state elected to the Senate in 30 years.\n\nAs the votes trickled in, Republicans launched a lawsuit challenging a mail-in ballot-counting practice in two Arizona counties that allowed voters to fix issues for up to five days after Election Day.\n\nThe tug-of-war over the remaining ballots came amid another roiling in controversy over vote totals in Broward County, Florida. President Donald Trump weighed in on both races in tweets Friday.\n\nThe Sinema-McSally race was widely viewed as one of the Democrats' best opportunities to gain seats in an unfavorable Senate election map. Democrats were defending 26 Senate seats in the midterms, while Republicans were defending nine.", "Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and his counterpart Vice Premier Liu He have resumed discussions about a possible deal that would ease trade tensions, just weeks before President Trump and President Xi are set to meet in Argentina for the G20 summit.\n\nMnuchin and He spoke via phone on Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people briefed on the conversation. The US is demanding that China put forth an offer before negotiations on a trade deal can begin, while China would like discussion to begin before making a formal proposal.\n\nChinese officials are not expecting to come to an agreement during the G20 summit, but instead a framework followed by negotiations on the details, The Wall Street Journal said. At most, the US and China may be able to come to a ceasefire in their ongoing trade war, with the US not raising prices.\n\nThe US has put $250 billion worth of tariffs on Chinese imports. On Jan. 1, $200 billion of goods are set to increase to 25% from 10%. The US is also reportedly considering tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports, worth $257 billion, if an agreement is not reached at the G20. These new tariffs would be the US's final push to force concessions from China.\n\n\n\nRead the full story in The Wall Street Journal\n\nWATCH:This trade deal may be what Trump needs to take on China", "Apple will sell fewer iPhones in the fourth quarter and cause \"a ripple effect throughout the supply chain,\" AlphaOne Capital Partners founding partner Dan Niles told CNBC on Monday.\n\nHis prediction followed a report that Lumentum, a facial recognition and augmented reality parts supplier for the tech giant, lowered its outlook because \"one of our largest Industrial and Consumer customers\" cut back on 3-D sensing shipments.\n\nThat's \"code for, pretty much, Apple,\" Niles said on \"Closing Bell.\"\n\n\"So, my belief is that fourth-quarter sales of iPhones is going to be less than expected, and I think what you're seeing today \u2014 with Lumentum cutting their estimates just 11 days after they already lowered guidance when they reported \u2014 is that things are definitely running worse than what was expected,\" he said.\n\nAdjustments to Lumentum's guidance amount to a \"21 million unit shortfall\" for Apple, which left investors with mixed feelings after it announced it would end reporting unit sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs in its earnings reports, Niles said.\n\nShares of Apple fell more than 5 percent on Monday, closing at $194.17. Lumentum took a bigger hit, plummeting nearly 33 percent to end the day at $37.50.\n\nApple will run into more problems selling its iPhone and other products because of issues facing markets in China, Brazil and India, Niles said.\n\n\"What people should be really nervous about is all the hardware companies underneath [Apple and] how that's going to impact them, because I don't think Lumentum is going to be the only one that's going to preannounce negatively driven by Apple when you get through this year,\" he said.\n\nSome Apple bulls defended the company's decision to stop reporting unit sales as a sign that investors should take Apple's services business into consideration moving forward.\n\n\"AAPL will stop disclosing unit sales figures next qtr, fueling fears the company has something to hide,\" Jefferies Group, who calls the stock a buy, said earlier this month. \"But AAPL will disclose Services gross margin for the first time ever, a potential catalyst for the stock. We believe AAPL intends to tell a compelling Services story, which we believe has 2x higher gross margin than hardware and improving.\"\n\nNiles, who is short Apple, said the Apple bulls \"are wrong\" because the company's \"ecosystem\" that's built on iPhone customers will not grow.\n\nNiles acknowledged there is a lot of \"optimism\" because Apple, which is up more than 20 percent year to date, is outperforming the S&P 500, which is up about 2 percent year to date. But Niles said that Apple \"should be under-performing the market.\"\n\n\"You can't sell services to somebody if they don't have an iPhone,\" he said. \"Services is a lagging indicator, it's not a leading indicator. And if you're selling that many less iPhones to users, you can't sell them services.\""]
