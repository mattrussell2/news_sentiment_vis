["WASHINGTON \u2014 The State Department improperly seized the passports of at least 31 American citizens trying to obtain vital records and other paperwork from the United States Embassy in Yemen, according to an inspector general\u2019s report released on Friday.\n\nThe passports were taken between December 2012 and June 2013, just as Yemen\u2019s fragile political system began descending into chaos. Consular officials claimed they confiscated the passports of citizens after finding that their printed names were false or fraudulent.\n\nIn many cases, the citizens had gone to the embassy to obtain American passports or birth records for children born in Yemen.

But as he hit the campaign trail this fall, Mr. Obama has vented his exasperation loud and often, assailing his successor in a sharper, more systematic way arguably than any former president has done in three-quarters of a century.\n\nAlthough some admirers believe he remains too restrained in an era of Trumpian bombast, Mr. Obama has excoriated the incumbent for \u201clying\u201d and \u201cfear-mongering\u201d and pulling \u201ca political stunt\u201d by sending troops to the border. As he opened a final weekend of campaigning before Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, Mr. Obama has re-emerged as the Democrats\u2019 most prominent face, pitting president versus president over the future of the country.\n\nIn a fiery speech in Miami on Friday afternoon before heading to Georgia for another rally, Mr. Obama said that even conservatives should be disturbed by Mr. Trump\u2019s disregard for the Constitution and basic decency. \u201cI know there are sincere conservatives who are compassionate and must think there is nothing compassionate about ripping immigrant children from the arms of their mothers at the border,\u201d he said.", "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing unusual about a new cabinet secretary coming to office inclined to favor a different policy direction, soliciting support from other agencies to bolster his views, disagreeing with staff or cutting through red tape,\u201d Justice Gorsuch wrote. \u201cOf course, some people may disagree with the policy and process.

The harms to the government from such a proceeding are self-evident.\u201d\n\nThe advocacy groups said that Mr. Ross\u2019s motives were a key element of the case. He initially said that he had acted in response to a December 2017 request from the Justice Department and that he had not consulted with the White House.\n\nLater, Mr. Ross acknowledged that he had been exploring the idea long before receiving a letter from the Justice Department and that he had discussed the issue with Stephen K.

Previously, transfers had to request a release from their team and were barred from direct contact with other coaches until they received it, creating a murky system of back-channel communication and uncertainty. Starting Oct. 15, they merely had to notify their team of their intention to transfer, after which their name would be put into a database and other coaches could reach out to them.\n\nAnother new rule permits players to compete in up to four games and still redshirt that season. Clemson\u2019s Kelly Bryant announced that he would transfer after this season\u2019s fourth game \u2014 and after Coach Dabo Swinney announced that the freshman Trevor Lawrence would be the starter.

Holgorsen and Jake Spavital, the offensive coordinator, have between them coached the future pro quarterbacks Case Keenum, Geno Smith and Johnny Manziel.

He emphasized that Dsuvia is delivered through a \u201cpre-filled, single-dose applicator,\u201d and said that its only permitted use will be in hospitals, surgical centers and other medically supervised settings. It is ideally suited for certain special circumstances, he said, particularly for soldiers wounded on the battlefield who might not have access to intravenous painkillers.\n\nDr. Gottlieb wrote that Dsuvia will not be dispensed to patients for home use or available at retail pharmacies, and that it should only be administered by health care providers with the single-dose applicators.

In synagogue on Rosh Hashana, they read the old words begging God for compassion, \u201cfor the sake of those killed for your holy name,\u201d and \u201cfor the sake of those slaughtered for your uniqueness.\u201d My husband\u2019s grandparents came here after those massacres, their previous spouses and children slaughtered like the people in the prayer. They kept reciting the prayer, and for their new American family it reverted to metaphor.\n\nIn the decades that followed, Jews from other places joined American synagogues, many bringing memories that American Jews had forgotten. Those memories were waiting for them in the synagogue\u2019s books. On the holiday of Purim, they recited the Book of Esther, about an ancient Persian leader\u2019s failed attempt at a Jewish genocide. It\u2019s a time for costumes and levity, for shaking noisemakers to blot out the evildoer\u2019s name. One year my brother dressed as the ayatollah, and the Persians in our congregation laughed. Another year someone dressed as Gorbachev; the Russians loved it. The evildoers seemed defeated.\n\nIn 2000, when Ms. Mallinger was 79, a Jewish senator was his party\u2019s nominee for vice president. A year later the White House hosted its first official Hanukkah party. About a decade later I attended one myself. In the White House we recited ancient words thanking God for rescuing us from hatred. To older Jews, this felt miraculous: My parents and grandfather gawked at my photos, awe-struck . But at the party I met younger Jewish leaders who often attended these events. To them, this was normal. The ancient hatred was a memory, words on a page.\n\nOr maybe it wasn\u2019t. In 2001, after terrorists attacked American cities, concrete barriers sprouted in front of my family\u2019s synagogue , police cruisers parked in the lot. This felt practical in a nation on edge; we assumed it affected everyone. As my children were born and grew, the barriers and guards became their normal. When I took my children to an interfaith Thanksgiving service at a church down the street from our synagogue, one of them asked me why no one was guarding the door.", "A Senate inquiry faulted state and federal oversight for fatal heat strokes and chaotic evacuations at nursing homes after last year\u2019s hurricanes, calling for tougher disaster preparedness standards on Friday.\n\nOfficials with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a federal agency that was a subject of the inquiry, have said they would clarify expectations for how nursing homes must maintain safe temperatures in emergencies. Officials added in an interview this week that they were actively seeking lessons from recent disasters. But they defended the agency\u2019s new preparedness requirements for health care providers, which did not come under enforcement until just after last year\u2019s hurricane season.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s report, released on Friday by the minority staff of the Finance Committee, comes weeks after several nursing homes in North Carolina and Florida flooded, lost power and required help evacuating after hurricanes. \u201cToo many of them are not equipped to handle matters of basic safety in disasters,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said in an interview.\n\nWhile the report noted that most nursing homes fared adequately after hurricanes in Florida and Texas last year, it concluded that tragic exceptions \u201cresulted from inadequate regulation and oversight, ineffective planning and communications protocols, and questionable decision-making by facility administrators.\u201d", "KANDAHAR, Afghanistan \u2014 Minutes before killing one of the most important generals in Afghanistan, the infiltrator made a final call to the Taliban.\n\nThough only a teenager, the assassin managed to get hired as an elite guard, slipping into government service with a fake ID and no background check.\n\nIt put him so close to the center of power in Afghanistan that he was just paces away from Gen.

Mr. Rebagliati recalled that at ski areas in California, snowboarders were often banned and ski patrols would call the police to complain that riders were trespassing.\n\nWhen he was unable to find a snowboard in a ski shop in British Columbia while he was in high school, Mr. Rebagliati built a makeshift snowboard from plywood, cutting off the toes of his ski boots and using the inner tube of a bike as a strap to hold his feet in place. He and his friends would train by sneaking into ski resorts in the Vancouver area before ski season began and hiking up the mountains.", "HONG KONG \u2014 Jin Yong, a literary giant of the Chinese-speaking world whose fantastical epic novels inspired countless film, television and video game adaptations and were read by generations of ethnic Chinese, died on Oct. 30 in Hong Kong.

If the findings are confirmed, the stone flakes and butchered animal bones the researchers uncovered would be evidence that early hominins \u2014 extinct members of the genus Homo, but most likely not of our species \u2014 were present in the Arabian Peninsula at least 100,000 years earlier than previously known.\n\nThe findings, which were published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution, also suggest early hominins did not need any special evolutionary adaptations before they ventured out from the grasslands of Africa and into the wilds of Arabia.\n\n\u201cAs the savanna expanded, so did humans of this period,\u201d said Michael Petraglia, an archaeologist from the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany and an author on the paper.", "Subscribe: iTunes | Google Play Music | How to Listen\n\nThe stories in Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah\u2019s debut collection, \u201cFriday Black,\u201d feel very much of this moment: Funny and violent and angry in equal measure, they cast a cleareyed look at themes of race and class in America. \u201cI was in college when Trayvon Martin was murdered.

She contacted the gift shop (which was once run by the Secret Service but is now a separate for-profit business no longer affiliated with the executive branch) to ask if it had any samples that had never been used.\n\nThe gift shop\u2019s director, Anthony Giannini, sent her a pair of prototypes given to him by a Secret Service agent, now retired, who had acquired them under Ronald Reagan. Never produced, they are slightly smaller than usual, more recessed and \u201celegant\u201d and, according to Mr. Giannini, \u201cthe only ones of their kind.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Ms. Wright wears a lot of shirts and dresses with French cuffs, the better to show them off.\n\n\u201cBut you never see a male president with a briefcase or a wallet,\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cSo even though I had a lot of designers reaching out to me to offer their new bags, I thought: \u2018Claire is not carrying a bag.

The problem, Ms. Harris said, is that \u201ca lot of stuff you see on the runway now is street wear, and it just didn\u2019t translate.\u201d She ended up making about 80 percent of Ms. Wright\u2019s wardrobe herself, she said, with the tailor LaVonne Richards.\n\n(Given the number of women currently running for office, that\u2019s a significant lesson \u2014 and one that fashion itself might do well to note.)", "\u201cWe spent the week crying and burying the dead,\u201d the rabbi said.\n\n\u201cCommunities all over the world gather in their sanctuaries,\u2019\u2019 she said, \u201cto turn them into sanctuaries again.\n\n\u201cThe pain doesn\u2019t diminish the hope.\u201d\n\nRector Jolly spoke about Richard Godfried, one of the people killed in the Pittsburgh attack, who was a friend\u2019s uncle.

But I know every single one of them.\u201d\n\nHeads nodded in the packed pews at Valley Beth Shalom, a thriving synagogue that is one of the largest in Judaism\u2019s Conservative movement. The men and women who were killed in Pittsburgh are familiar to every synagogue. These are the faithful congregants who show up early, cut the bagels for the social hour afterward, greet the worshipers and hand out the prayer books at the sanctuary door.\n\nThe service on Friday, Rabbi Feinstein said, was a \u201ccommunal sitting shiva,\u201d the mourning period observed by Jews for close family and friends. \u201cWe need to sit shiva because all of us have been wounded deeply this week,\u201d he told the congregation.\n\nHe had spent the last week receiving emails and phone calls from clergy of many faiths, offering solace and support \u2014 which made him hopeful. But he had also been counseling parents who wanted advice on how to talk to their children about what had happened in Pittsburgh. He said he soon came to realize that what they really wanted was help processing the tragedy for themselves.\n\nIn the car on the way to temple on Friday, Jamie Weissman decided to broach the issue with her 6-year-old son.

Here in Washington, the industry has spent over $20 million to promote Initiative 1634, according to state finance filings. Those fighting the ballot measure have raised $100,000.\n\nStarting last year, legislatures in Michigan, Arizona and California passed laws that pre-emptively bar local governments from imposing such taxes in the future. The outcome in Oregon and Washington, political analysts say, could determine the future of the country\u2019s soda tax movement by encouraging soda companies to embrace ballot measures in states across the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pivotal moment,\u201d said Mark Pertschuk, director of the advocacy group Grassroots Change. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to overstate the chilling effect of having soda taxes barred from the whole West Coast, where so many progressive policies are born.\u201d\n\nOpponents of the approach criticize it as overreach. The Oregon initiative, for example, takes the form of a constitutional amendment and critics say it is so vaguely worded that it could be used to block future taxes on restaurant meals, electronic cigarettes, catering halls and trucking companies that transport McDonald\u2019s Happy Meals.\n\n\u201cThese pre-emptive measures undermine democracy and completely take away a local government\u2019s ability to do what\u2019s best for their communities,\u201d said Jennifer L.

Maurice R. Greenberg, a former chief executive of the American International Group, finally settled a lawsuit last year that rested on the law. Initially filed in 2005 by Eliot Spitzer when he was attorney general of New York, the case related to two transactions that inaccurately portrayed A.I.G.\u2019s financial results over four years. The settlement required Mr. Greenberg to pay $9 million, which represented the bonuses he received during the period when the transactions took place.\n\nMr. Greenberg\u2019s dislike for the Martin Act did not end with the settlement. He joined with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to support legislation that would effectively prohibit states from pursuing fraud claims involving corporate disclosures, as The New York Times reported in April. \u201cI fought two wars for my country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is another war.\u201d\n\nThe bill, introduced this year by Representative Tom MacArthur, a Republican from New Jersey, would require that all securities fraud claims be filed in federal court. That would mean that only federal antifraud provisions applied.\n\nThe legislation also stipulates that \u201cno law, rule, regulation, judgment, agreement, order or other action of any state or political subdivision thereof shall regulate securities fraud with respect to an issuer.\u201d That would prevent states from adopting provisions to address fraud involving companies operating within their jurisdiction unless those laws were based on the same requirements as the federal securities laws.\n\nThis approach is consistent with laws passed by Congress in the 1990s to require that most private securities fraud lawsuits be filed in the federal courts rather than state courts and impose heightened standards for proving a violation. These laws effectively limit the authority of states to use their own courts to pursue fraud claims against corporations.\n\nMr. MacArthur\u2019s bill has not moved forward, but there is a chance Congress will adopt it after the midterm elections, especially if the Republicans lose control of the House. That would largely undermine the power of the state attorneys general to police corporate conduct and leave it to the Securities and Exchange Commission or private investors to pursue cases. And the S.E.C. has not been focused on corporate disclosure (unless a chief executive takes to Twitter and makes highly publicized statements that turn out to be false).\n\nThe lawsuit against Exxon shows that the Martin Act retains its vitality as a means to police corporate conduct. A case like this can become a lightning rod for those who want to keep the states from using their authority to get involved in corporate disclosure. It remains to be seen if that might generate the attention required to help Mr. MacArthur\u2019s bill advance.", "LOS ANGELES \u2014 It was the golden hour here when Sunny Suljic tumbled out of a black S.U.V. and onto Sawtelle Boulevard, a commercial strip just west of Route 405 lined with Japanese noodle joints and third-wave coffee shops.

The researchers estimated the value of public parks to homeowners living near them using data on 600,000 homes sold in New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago. The study, \u201cUnlocking Amenities: Estimating Public-Good Complementarity,\u201d found that when the crime rate in a city neighborhood declined, the value of private real estate near parks soared.

Closing a national monument to allow oil drilling \u2014 or terminating the Land and Water Conservation Fund \u2014 might help a company make more profit in the short run. But a vast array of benefits will also be destroyed. In a direct effect, hunters, kayakers, backpackers and visitors will simply stop going, and the Interior Department says these people spent $50 billion on recreation in federal lands last year.\n\nBut think about the broader harm done by this zero-sum mentality.

He was certainly no Beethoven when it came to ambitious musical forms. At 20, urged by a mentor, he wrote a symphony but soon withdrew it and never completed another. He came under pressure to compose a stirring Norwegian national opera and tried to do it, but got no further than some choral scenes and sketches. He wrote the wonderful, if modest, Lyric Pieces, some chamber works, a few volumes of elegant songs. His incidental music for Ibsen\u2019s play \u201cPeer Gynt\u201d were fashioned into two popular orchestra suites. A nd there is, of course, his justly beloved Piano Concerto.\n\nA great? No. Should that matter? Absolutely not.\n\nYet I\u2019ve come to accept that I and other lovers of music, like lovers of any art form, can\u2019t help being swept up in the search for, and identification of, greatness. Your first time hearing some exhilarating or mystifying work by a composer of the past \u2014 Mozart\u2019s \u201cJupiter\u201d Symphony, Beethoven\u2019s searching Fourth Piano Concerto, Wagner\u2019s trance-inducing \u201cTristan und Isolde,\u201d Stravinsky\u2019s shattering \u201cRite of Spring,\u201d take your pick \u2014 can be as formative a moment as anything in your life. These works, and the composers who wrote them, become living presences; it\u2019s natural to acknowledge the place they hold for us, and to seek reassurance that the things we love are important to others, too.\n\nMy most brazen venture into grappling with greatness came in 2011, with my Top 10 Composers project, a two-week series of articles I wrote for The New York Times. The goal was to determine a list of the top 10 composers in history. Of course, the whole project was an intellectual game, though one played seriously by me and the more than 1,500 readers whose comments were posted during the two weeks.\n\nSome of the most interesting reactions came from music-lovers who actually found the game harmful. Others, while dismissing the exercise as absurd, sent in their own top 10 lists, often with injunctions like \u201cDon\u2019t you dare leave out Mahler!\u201d For me, the game was also a genuine exercise in trying to be precise about what makes a composer\u2019s music great, about why a composer merits a place. The final list, as I emphasized, was not the point. The analysis involved in determining it was.\n\nAs a ground rule I omitted living composers from consideration, arguing that we are just too close to these creators to have enough perspective. I think that one of the most rewarding things about taking in music by living composers, as with new work in any artistic field, is that questions of the greatness of a piece, and predictions of its longevity, are irrelevant. If an exciting new novel comes along, literary-minded people want to read it, talk about it, maybe argue over it. But the question of whether the novelist is another Dickens or Proust is absurd. The same goes for new plays, new films, new pop groups, new television dramas.\n\nIn the end, I think of my job as bifurcated. I will always be unapologetically hooked by the reality that there is greatness in music. In my reviews and other stories, I try to explain, for example, why Schubert was absolutely great; why Debussy; why Wagner.", "\u201cFaith & Freedom monitors voters\u2019 databases to see which of the people they have interacted with vote early,\u201d Lance Lemmonds, the communications director of the coalition told The Christian Post. \u201cFor those that haven\u2019t voted early, the organization will send out about 28 million digital ads encouraging them to vote in the last weekend and Monday.\u201d The coalition, he added, \u201cwill inundate Christian conservative voters in the last weekend.

According to a 2012 article on NPR\u2019s website, the organization assigns citizens points for certain characteristics, such as membership on anti-abortion lists or an interest in Nascar. If a voter\u2019s score \u201ctotaled over 600 points,\u201d Mr. Dallas said, \u201cwe run that person against the voter registration database.\u201d If not registered, \u201cthat became one of the key people we were going to target.\u201d\n\nIn a 2016 interview on Daystar TV, Mr. Dallas was even clearer: \u201cWe have a ministry consultant who will work with each church to help them get their people out to vote on Election Day.\u201d\n\nIt would be inaccurate to assume that Christian nationalists are targeting only white evangelicals. Conservative Catholics are very much part of the focus, as are nonwhite evangelicals. Latino pastors and churches are targeted with messages about abortion, \u201creligious freedom\u201d and economic self-sufficiency.\n\n\u201cMaybe because you believe that when American Democrats offer you free stuff they care about you?\u201d said the Spanish-speaking narrator of a Prager University video that aired at an event for dozens of Latino pastors in the San Diego area last month. The event, held at the Ocean View Church, was organized by Alianza de Pastores Unidos de San Diego, a regional affiliate of Church United. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d the narrator said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t come to the U.S. for free stuff; you came here for the opportunity that allows you to work and earn money.\u201d\n\nAt the same event, a businessman named Craig Huey, speaking through a translator, told the assembled pastors: \u201cYou need to be able to explain to your fellowship these issues. When we talk about abortion, for example, what is more important, talking about the minimum wage or about life?\u201d Mr. Huey volunteered to host election forums at the pastors\u2019 churches. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do it for you. And if you want to do it, we have a PowerPoint that you can use to go straight down the ballot. It\u2019s not Republican, it\u2019s not Democrat. But where do they stand on abortion?\u201d\n\nLeaders of the Christian nationalist movement appear to be aware that their political activity may raise questions about their compliance with the legal and tax guidelines intended to prevent churches from engaging in direct campaigning for political candidates and parties. At the Unionville pastor briefing, Tami Fitzgerald instructed pastors on how to thread the needle: \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you can talk about issues all day long as a pastor, you can tell people who you\u2019re going to vote for,\u201d she said.

That\u2019s the problem with this pattern: Because presidential motivations and actions aren\u2019t sufficiently documented, there is no conclusive explanation, though a great deal of academic work has been done on this subject, as I\u2019ve written just before the last two midterm elections.\n\nThe main working hypothesis is a cynical one: Presidents are politicians who care overwhelmingly about their own re-election. (And to a much lesser extent, two-term presidents look to ensure the election of their successors.) They stimulate the economy \u2014 and, indirectly, the stock market \u2014 for maximum effect as their own elections grow closer, or so the theory goes.\n\nThat implies that their first year in office is the best time to make politically painful moves, which won\u2019t hurt them in the polls later.

The one case with a smoking gun occurred, naturally enough, in the Nixon administration.\n\nSecret White House tapes, combined with the investigations of the special prosecutor and the House Judiciary Committee, as well as efforts by private individuals and researchers, are gradually giving us a more precise view of the internal workings of the government in that era than is available for other administrations.\n\nThanks to those Nixon White House tapes, Burton A. Abrams, an economics professor at the University of Delaware, has shown that in 1971 and early in the 1972 election year, President Richard Nixon secretly pressured the Federal Reserve chairman, Arthur F. Burns, to expand the money supply, with the goal of ensuring Mr. Nixon\u2019s second term.\n\nMr. Nixon took other actions, including the imposition of wage and price controls to curb inflation, all aimed at improving his standing in the polls.

On Friday night, the Phil would begin its final run of performances before moving for the summer from the Disney Hall (indoors, posh) to the Hollywood Bowl (outdoors, Sting plays there, you can eat a Snickers in your seat). For the finale of the orchestra\u2019s 99th season, essentially the lead-in to this year\u2019s centennial extravaganza, Dudamel was putting on \u201cDas Paradies und die Peri,\u201d Schumann\u2019s gigantic concert oratorio: nearly two hours long, renowned singers in dramatic roles, a huge chorus, shattering climaxes, tunes for days. The text tells the story of a Peri, a kind of benevolent fallen angel, who can gain admission to heaven only by bringing the proper gift to the gates of paradise. She tries three times, in escalatingly romantic-allegorical ways, and it\u2019s the third gift, the last tear of a sinner who repented on his deathbed, that causes the gates to open. The Peri enters heaven, to cloudbursts and hosannas.\n\nFamous in Schumann\u2019s lifetime, \u201cDas Paradies,\u201d composed in 1843, is seldom performed now; Dudamel came across it a few years ago and immediately felt he\u2019d discovered a masterpiece. \u201cI was like, my God,\u201d he whispers, recalling the moment. \u201cWhat is this? My God, how to deal for such a long time with that amount of beauty?\u201d\n\nThe difficulty seemed great enough when he was studying the score on his own, but once he began working with the musicians, it became even more pronounced. On Tuesday of that week, when the full chorus came in to rehearse with the soloists, Dudamel realized that the production design had caused them to be seated too far back, all the way behind the stage, in seats normally reserved for audience members, from which hinterland they couldn\u2019t see him properly and couldn\u2019t hear the soloists. The chorus members had little LED lights that clipped onto their music folders so they could see their scores in the dark; from the podium, they looked like a sea of distant white pinpricks. Then on Wednesday, when the singers were joined by the full orchestra, it became clear that the location of the soloists\u2019 elevated platform, which was positioned above and behind the instrumentalists, would make it hard for the Peri and others to be heard over the strings and winds. Now the singers were all out of sync, and the orchestra members were playing too loudly, because they weren\u2019t listening to the singers at all.\n\nDudamel\u2019s jean jacket was draped over his seat back. His sneakers, dangling above the floor, tapped on the stool\u2019s chrome ring. He insisted on moving the chorus closer to the orchestra \u2014 moving them onstage, out of the audience seats, a change that demanded a serious reconfiguration of the planned arrangement of forces. Then he addressed the musicians. When Rousseau was a young man, he said, he loved to talk more than to listen. But as Rousseau grew older, he came to understand that listening was sometimes more important. \u201cIt is so important here, this concept,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about not playing \u2014 I\u2019m not telling you not to play. But if you aren\u2019t willing to do this kind of listening-playing, then you\u2019ll never be able to do this. We\u2019ll never have the space of the \u2014 the magic of that uniqueness. It\u2019s not about where the singers are. They could be here in front, and I\u2019m sure we would still have this problem.

So please.\u201d\n\nHe raised the baton, a levare. On his downbeat the orchestra began to play. The winds came in first, with a fey, lilting figure, light but energetic, like the sound of water splashing in a fountain. Then a quartet began to sing. They had rehearsed this number a dozen times over the course of the week, but now something had changed. The violins began to double the singers, while the winds played extravagant swirls around them. The effect was astonishing. Where the chorus had sounded diluted, it was now vividly alive and present in the music. By the time Dudamel finished his adjustments, one of the singers had called out to him: \u201cThank you!\u201d\n\nThe way Dudamel looks at it, he\u2019s not a ruler; he\u2019s more like an ally of the players. He is on hand to offer his thoughts, help them sound their best. Cooperation gets better results. Musicians, he thinks, are like everyone else. Music is supposed to feel good. Doesn\u2019t everyone do their best when they feel good?", "This is not Ted Cruz\u2019s Texas. Neither is Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s hometown (and mine) of El Paso. It\u2019s a tattooed, blue-collar, Latino city of nearly one million. Mr. Cruz hardly comes here; his last visit he attracted just 2,000 people at a West Side high school \u2014 on a Saturday. This Texas hasn\u2019t benefited from a quarter-century of unbroken Republican power. The biggest employer, the Army, ships people out just as quickly as it ships them in. A sprawling city of rail yards and refineries, El Paso has one of the highest illiteracy rates in America and some of its worst access to health care.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more of this Texas: the Lower Rio Grande Valley, San Antonio, South Dallas, East Austin and inside the Loop in Houston. This is a young Texas, about which there is a prevailing myth: It doesn\u2019t vote. But that myth is being sorely tested. Some 15.6 million people are registered to vote this year, 1.6 million more than in 2014. More than four million have voted so far; so far in El Paso this year\u2019s turnout has looked more like a presidential contest than a midterm.\n\nThere\u2019s another myth about Texas: \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s still Texas.\u201d Which is to say, whatever the personalities and trends might indicate, in the end, Texas will vote as it always has, for crimson-red candidates.\n\nAs Erica Grieder at The Houston Chronicle has pointed out, that\u2019s about the laziest thing that non-Texan experts on politics can say. The number of Texans who identify as conservative has flattened, according to the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, while the number who identify as progressive has swollen.\n\nThis election is an exercise in brute electoral force: the full on clash of the real, modern Texas with a worn out, calcified caricature. \u201cThis is not a persuasion election,\u201d said James Henson, a University of Texas political scientist. \u201cThis is a mobilization election.\u201d\n\nThe Cruz-O\u2019Rourke race may be the main event, but the ballot is full of competitive matchups. Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, may lose to a Houston lawyer named Justin Nelson. Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller has his hands full with his Democratic opponent, a retired Air Force colonel named Kim Olson. Up in Dallas, Representative Pete Sessions, a Republican, is hearing the footsteps of the former N.F.L. player Colin Allred. In the western Houston suburbs, the Democrat, Lizzie Fletcher, is just a few points behind the incumbent, John Culberson. The Texas Tribune reports that Republicans may even lose their supermajority in the State Senate.\n\nAnother myth? Latinos don\u2019t vote. In fact, Latino turnout in Texas has been creeping up, though it\u2019s not yet at the same rate as Anglos. It\u2019s a chicken-and-egg problem: Candidates spend so much time talking to Anglo voters they get around to Latinos late, so they\u2019re less motivated.", "bad url", "9 U.S.\n\n\u2018Can The President Be Impeached?\u2019 We Answer Your Questions", "DAKAR, Senegal \u2014 The Nigerian Army, part of a military criticized for rampant human rights abuses, on Friday used the words of President Trump to justify its fatal shootings of rock-throwing protesters.\n\nSoldiers fired this Monday on a march of about 1,000 Islamic Shiite activists who had blocked traffic on the outskirts of the capital, Abuja.

Worth\n\nGetting back to Yemen was probably the hardest trip I\u2019ve ever had to arrange. It took months of work, two separate visas, talks with three different governments and endless negotiations with Yemeni friends and helpers. We had to overcome the understandable doubts of The Times about the safety of our travel plan. But in the end, the 11-hour drive from Aden to northern Yemen \u2014 the most dangerous stretch \u2014 proved strangely anticlimactic. Every time we approached one of the checkpoints manned by young Yemeni gunmen, I\u2019d slink lower in my seat and take off my shades, in hopes of looking a bit less like a Blackwater mercenary. (Lynsey Addario, in a full black niqab, was less conspicuous.) We were traveling through a lawless desert where all kinds of gangs and jihadists, including Al Qaeda, are active. But our 19 year-old driver just looked over at me and laughed. \u201cYou can keep them on,\u201d he said.\n\nThe key to safety in Yemen is social networks. If you know a family with local and tribal connections, they can protect you in almost any situation. Our trip was made possible by a southern family I\u2019ve been close to for more than a decade. Their knowledge of the terrain, and their ties to various factions across the south, were worth more than any number of bodyguards or cars. But their influence extended only to the south, the non-Houthi areas of Yemen. In the north, I depended on another old friend named Nasser, who has negotiated Yemen\u2019s chaotic politics with unusual skill (and some luck). He always maintained a good relationship with Yemen\u2019s longtime ruler, Ali Abdullah Saleh. After the Houthis captured Yemen\u2019s capital, Sana, in 2014, he made sure to stay on their good side. He helped link me to the people I needed to meet, as did a couple of other old Yemeni friends.\n\n[Get a weekly roundup of Times coverage of war delivered to your inbox.

They were happy to show us houses bombed by their enemies, and to recite their propaganda. But they initially refused to let us talk to any fighters or clerics, or to attend funerals. Halfway through our trip, Lynsey and I were talking to a young Houthi official when it suddenly became clear: This guy understood what we wanted. Not only that, he was willing to push hard to help us get it. From then on, we exploited him as much as we dared, asking him to wake up at 7 a.m., and to accompany us everywhere \u2014 because only he, the insider, could persuade the Houthis to talk to us in the short time frame we had.\n\nThis week\u2019s cover story for The Times Magazine is the culmination of reporting from that trip to Yemen. Today the Houthis fight on in a war that has created the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.", "KARACHI, Pakistan \u2014 After protesters blocked highways and forced the closing of schools and businesses, the Pakistani government and Islamist leaders enraged over the acquittal of a Christian woman accused of blasphemy reached an agreement on Friday night that allows further appeals and bars her from leaving the country.\n\nThe woman, Asia Bibi, was convicted in 2010 on little evidence of violating Pakistan\u2019s law against blasphemy by insulting the Prophet Muhammad. She spent years on death row before she was acquitted on Wednesday by the country\u2019s Supreme Court.\n\nDespite her legal victory, which was hailed worldwide by rights groups, Ms. Bibi\u2019s lawyers and her family have expressed fears for her safety because hard-line Islamist parties in Pakistan have called for her execution.\n\nUnder the accord, which some analysts viewed as a capitulation to extremists, the government agreed not to oppose the filing of an appeal in the Supreme Court of Ms. Bibi\u2019s acquittal.

Her upbringing was Roman Catholic, suburban and comfortably middle class. At Yale, she fell under the tutelage of John Hersey, author of \u201cHiroshima,\u201d one of many influential figures who would shape her career. She got her start livening up a newsletter for the Teamsters in New York, jumped from there to U.P.I. and was soon dispatched to Paris. Hired away by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Sunday Times, she made her name in 1987 with a story about watching a young woman die after being shot by a sniper during a militia siege of a Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut. The reporting she did there \u2014 excruciatingly close, filled with intimate glimpses of human suffering \u2014 established a template. \u201cIt has always seemed to me that what I write about is humanity in extremis,\u201d she would say in a 2001 feature article, \u201cpushed to the unendurable, and that it is important to tell people what really happens in wars.\u201d\n\nHilsum unpacks one terrifying story after another to illustrate how far Colvin was willing to go to expose the truth. Trapped in Chechnya in December 1999 during an aerial bombing campaign by the Russian Army, she and a young Russian photographer were forced to hike for days through the snowbound Caucasus to the Georgian border. Stopping to rest meant becoming a target for bombs. \u201cShe struggled to breathe, regretting every cigarette she had smoked,\u201d Hilsum writes in an excruciatingly vivid account. \u201cDima sat down, saying he could go no further. Marie knew that despair was even more dangerous than the cold. \u2018Get up! Keep moving!\u2019 she urged.\u201d\n\nColvin also had a knack for gaining the confidence of dictators and demagogues. In 1986 she talked her way into the compound of the Libyan strongman Muammar el-Qaddafi in Tripoli. Hilsum delights in describing their first meeting: \u201cAfter a few minutes Qaddafi entered dressed in a gray padded flight suit, sockless feet peeking from lizard skin slip-on shoes. \u2018I am Qaddafi,\u2019 he announced. \u2018No kidding,\u2019 Marie thought.\u201d She landed an exclusive interview and maintained contact with him for years. She befriended Yasir Arafat in exile in Tunisia, joined him on his return from the 1993 Oslo Accords and visited his Ramallah compound when it was besieged by the Israel Defense Forces in 2002. Colvin liked Arafat but sparred with him over his failure to suppress Palestinian violence; she was commissioned to write an Arafat biography, but could never find the discipline to finish it.\n\nAway from combat zones, Colvin moved easily through London high society and hosted memorable soirees in her Hammersmith home. \u201cElegant in a black cocktail dress, she mixed vodka martinis, the house full of actors, poets and politicians as well as journalists,\u201d Hilsum writes of one such gathering. She drank to excess, took many lovers and married twice. Her relationships with gifted but unreliable men who abused her trust left her emotionally shattered. Some anecdotes that Hilsum relates will be familiar to those who have read Marie Brenner\u2019s fine profile of Colvin in Vanity Fair, now adapted for film and republished in an anthology of Brenner\u2019s pieces, \u201cA Private War: Marie Colvin and Other Tales of Heroes, Scoundrels, and Renegades\u201d (Simon & Schuster, paper, $16). But Hilsum, who had full access to Colvin\u2019s notes and journals, is able to delve far deeper into her subject\u2019s complicated inner life. \u201cI was blinded by your looks and the sex and so tried to ignore what my brain was telling me,\u201d Colvin writes in her diary after discovering her longtime partner\u2019s multiple affairs. \u201cSo I drank more and read less and my world telescoped down to yours \u2014 sex, looks and money.\u201d", "It shouldn\u2019t be so hard. Take, again, wages. Expanding overtime pay, raising wages, even doing something about the enormous and under-discussed problem of wage theft \u2014 we don\u2019t wish to address these problems, Democrats should say, out of fairness or compassion or some desire to punish capitalists. We want to address them because putting more money in working- and middle-class people\u2019s pockets is a better way to spur on the economy than giving rich people more tax cuts.\n\nThat\u2019s an argument that might appeal broadly, but it\u2019s backed up by a theory that in our time is practically seditious: that the public sector can make better decisions about where money should go than the private sector. That is a principle Democrats have been skittish about supporting. But it is one they must start defending without apology.\n\nThey should defend it because it\u2019s what more and more economists argue and because it\u2019s what Democrats believe. There\u2019s a lot of ideological space between Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Representative Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona, who is among the most left-leaning members of the House. But they\u2019re both Democrats for a reason, and presumably that reason is they think government can be a force for good in people\u2019s lives. So, if Democrats think it, they should say it.\n\nAnd now we have arrived at an alternate theory, a story: Giving more money to working people and investing in their needs is how an economy grows. That\u2019s a direct counterargument to supply-side economics. If enough Democrats say it and say it and say it, they can drive a stake through supply-side\u2019s heart.\n\nOnce Democrats can make that case, they\u2019ll be able to turn the tables on the supply-siders. Republicans will argue that government investments and wage increases are \u201cjob killers.\u201d But Democrats, rather than merely appealing to people\u2019s consciences, will be able to respond that government investments and wage increases are growth producers that will spread benefits well beyond the top 5 percent or 10 percent.\n\nThe story could use a name. The venture capitalist Nick Hanauer and Eric Liu, a former Bill Clinton domestic policy adviser, coined \u201cmiddle-out economics\u201d five years ago. President Obama even used the phrase a few times.\n\nThe important thing is the idea. Democrats must persuade America that there\u2019s a better way to expand the economy than the way Republicans have been advocating for decades. Just as inflation and other ills opened the door for critiques of Keynesianism in the 1970s, so have inequality and disinvestment done the same for critiques of supply-side today.

The book fuses fantasy and even Joycean tropes to create an entertaining, passionate story.

This is irresponsible, and shows that Republican handwringing over deficits was always phony \u2013 which some of us pointed out at the time.\n\nBut something that has been pointed out less is that this is actually part of a broader story: fiscal policy has been off the rails since 2010, not because of what it has done to the national debt, but because of what it has done to the macroeconomy.\n\nHere\u2019s what fiscal policy should do: it should support demand when the economy is weak, and it should pull that support back when the economy is strong. As John Maynard Keynes said, \u201cThe boom, not the slump, is the right time for austerity.\u201d And up until 2010 the U.S. more or less followed that prescription.

Unsurprisingly, he had never heard Shirley\u2019s music before, but speaking about it now, he borders on reverence. \u201c\u2018Lullaby of Birdland\u2019 was one of the first ones that I knew I wanted to include, because he starts off quoting a couple of classical pieces, and then when he goes into the song, it\u2019s almost like a false start, because he uses the melody as the beginning of a fugue,\u201d Bowers said in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s doing a proper fugue, exposing the subject, et cetera, within a jazz context. I listened to that and said, \u2018Wow, I\u2019ve never heard anybody do that before.\u2019\u201d\n\nBy the early 1960s, Shirley was recording regularly for Cadence Records and was represented by Columbia Artists management (whose roster included Igor Stravinsky, Paul Robeson and Aaron Copland). This helped him become a fixture of New York cabarets like the Cookery, though he despised playing in clubs, where he rarely felt the audiences respected his music enough. Columbia also booked the tour depicted in \u201cGreen Book.\u201d\n\nSix years earlier, Nat King Cole had been brutally assaulted onstage in Birmingham, Ala., and swore he would never return to the segregated South. The region remained dangerous for black travelers into the 1960s (the movie title refers to a guide, similar to one that AAA might have issued, to help them find safe passage), but Shirley undertook his tour of whites-only theaters and parlor venues out of civic obligation \u2014 and stubbornness. He refused to be told, yet again, what he could play where.\n\nIn \u201cGreen Book,\u201d the tour begins at Shirley\u2019s resplendent apartment in the artists\u2019 units above Carnegie Hall, where he lived for more than 50 years. You can imagine that he enjoyed the real estate but also felt trapped in a kind of bell tower, overhearing the symphonies that he would rather have been performing. Yet Shirley did have illustrious moments on Carnegie\u2019s stage. He played concerts with his trio there once a year. And he held the piano chair during the Carnegie Hall debut of Duke Ellington\u2019s \u201cNew World a-Comin\u2019,\u201d in 1955, playing big, flourishing chords during his cadenzas and strutting proudly in the left hand under the combined jazz ensemble and symphony orchestra.", "In this royal comedy, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz play two ladies at court who manipulate the diminished Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) to suit their own ambitions, and to judge from screen time alone, all three women are evenly matched leads. Yet to throw the three of them into the same best actress race might split the vote in what is shaping up to be a very competitive category.\n\nThe film\u2019s distributor, Fox Searchlight, has come up with a unique fix: The studio is positioning Colman as the sole lead and the marketing will suggest that voters consider Stone and Weisz for supporting slots. While that order upholds the royal hierarchy, it seems outrageous to argue that Stone and Weisz are not the protagonists of \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d since they do all of the film\u2019s plotting.\n\nStill, with this strategy, Fox Searchlight is probably mindful of Oscar history. No movie has placed more than one woman in the best actress category since Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis were nominated for \u201cThelma and Louise\u201d in 1992, yet a twofer is so common in the best supporting actress category that \u201cUp in the Air,\u201d \u201cThe Fighter\u201d \u201cThe Help\u201d and \u201cDoubt\u201d all managed it in the last decade. To split up the women of \u201cThe Favourite\u201d in this fashion may be the only way to get all three nominated.\n\nThe supporting-actor gambit feels more questionable when it comes to \u201cGreen Book\u201d (Nov. 21), a 1960s road-trip dramedy with Mahershala Ali as a virtuoso pianist who hires a lightly racist palooka (Viggo Mortensen) to serve as his chauffeur while touring the Deep South. \u201cGreen Book,\u201d based on a true story, wouldn\u2019t work if these two actors were anything less than equals; in fact, during the film\u2019s centerpiece scene, Ali\u2019s character argues to a bigoted restaurateur that he deserves the same seat at the table as Mortensen.\n\nBut Universal will push Mortensen as the film\u2019s sole lead, while Ali will contend in the supporting-actor category. I\u2019m told that Ali made the choice himself, based on the fact that he enters \u201cGreen Book\u201d 15 minutes later than Mortensen, and this distinction may earn him his second Oscar (after his supporting win for \u201cMoonlight\u201d). Ali is that strong in the role, and his screen time will swamp other contenders in his category. It\u2019s the same strategy that was used by Viola Davis, who positioned herself as a supporting actress for \u201cFences\u201d and won her first Oscar, even though she\u2019d previously taken home a lead-actress Tony for the same role on Broadway.", "Even after paring back service twice this year because it could not muster enough engineers and equipment to fulfill its schedule, New Jersey Transit is still aggravating customers by canceling trains.\n\nOn the line that Mr. Leon rides, the railroad canceled the same train on three straight days.\n\nMr. Leon, 58, has been riding New Jersey Transit long enough to remember when it was a model of efficiency, held in high regard across the country.\n\nAn audit of the railroad that Mr. Murphy ordered just after his inauguration in January concluded that the fleet is so old that failing to replace any of its train cars in the next five years would pose \u201csignificant risk to the network and passengers.\u201d\n\nBy next year, nearly 90 percent of those coaches will be at least 12 years old, absent any replacements, the audit showed.\n\nReports filed with the Federal Transit Administration show that the fleet has been shrinking and aging. The average age of its rail fleet was 18.6 years in 2017. By contrast, Metro-North Railroad, which serves the suburbs north of New York City, reported last year that the average age of its fleet was 15.7 years.\n\nFour of New Jersey Transit\u2019s locomotives were 37 years old, each having traveled more than 2.2 million miles, according to the 2017 data, and more than 150 of its passenger cars were at least 40 years old.\n\nNew Jersey Transit\u2019s trains also break down more frequently than other commuter railroads. Data compiled by the Federal Transit Administration showed that New Jersey Transit\u2019s trains had 236 major mechanical failures in 2017. That was far more than the 89 reported by Metro-North or the 132 reported by the Long Island Rail Road.", "The October employment numbers feature everything you might hope for in a jobs report.\n\nEmployers keep creating jobs at a healthy clip, 250,000 of them in October, a boom that was apparent in every major sector and that continued unabated even as the American economy inched closer to full employment.\n\nThe unemployment rate remained at a multidecade low of 3.7 percent. More notably, the proportion of the population either working or looking for work rose 0.2 percent. The number of adults not in the labor force at all fell by 487,000.\n\nAnd employers evidently needed to pay higher wages to coax these workers off the sidelines. Long the soft underbelly of this expansion, average hourly earnings are now up 3.1 percent over the last year, from 2.8 percent in the previous reading.\n\nPut it together, and this is the best time for the American labor market in at least 18 years and maybe closer to 50 \u2014 though it would be nice to see sustained wage growth substantially higher than inflation, not just in a single month, before making any comparisons to the boom of the late 1960s.", "Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.\n\n__________\n\nDan Loeb could win even if he loses his battle at Campbell Soup.\n\nThe activist investor and founder of the hedge fund Third Point has sought to instigate change at the food maker. He blames poor deal making for the near-halving of the company\u2019s share price over the past three years, and wants its shareholders to replace the entire board of 12 people.\n\nBut cutting costs from those bad deals should raise Campbell\u2019s valuation whatever happens.\n\nMr. Loeb described a 100-day plan for the company in a presentation that he published on Tuesday, which included a proposal to \u201chit the ground running\u201d in order to revive the company\u2019s soup. He believes that Campbell\u2019s stock could be worth $70 a share by 2022 if he can overhaul the board and implement other changes. That\u2019s roughly 45 percent higher than its current price, and almost where the stock traded in early 2016 before Campbell bought Pacific Foods and Snyder\u2019s-Lance, leaving it financially and operationally stretched.\n\nThe idea is to boost earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization to $2 billion by 2020, from an estimated $1.6 billion in 2019.

Also, Nancy Moonves, the ex-wife of Leslie Moonves, the ousted CBS chief executive, traded one Upper East Side co-op for another around the corner.\n\nAnd in Chelsea, the screenwriters Henry Bean and Leora Barish sold a townhouse with a private yoga studio.\n\nThe limestone-and-red brick mansion on East 74th Street, sold by Mr. Lasry, sits on one of the neighborhood\u2019s most desired streets, between Fifth and Madison Avenues. It was designed at the turn of the 20th century by Alexander Welch and built for Francis Lynde Stetson and his wife, Elizabeth Ruff Stetson. Stetson was a law partner with Grover Cleveland between Cleveland\u2019s two split terms as president.\n\nOver the years, many residents have come and gone from the mansion, including Chagall, who lived on the top floor with his wife, the writer Bella Chagall, shortly after arriving in New York in 1941. They decorated their apartment with his artwork. Jackson rented the house for six months, from August 1999 to February 2000. (The asking rent was $75,000 a month in 1998.)\n\nThe building also has been featured on the big and small screens.

Facebook\u2019s quarterly financial results, which it announced on Tuesday, showed a slowdown in revenue that appears to have been caused, at least in part, by the company\u2019s efforts to rein in bad actors.\n\nBut a flurry of reports this week underscored how ineffective these measures have been. A Vice reporter, William Turton, found that despite Facebook\u2019s new efforts at advertising transparency, he was able to get approval for ads that he posted in the name of fake political groups and sitting senators. When Twitter unveiled a page dedicated to capturing news on the midterm elections, BuzzFeed quickly noticed that the page was spotlighting disinformation.\n\nEven when one social network manages to drive away bad actors, those bad actors are generally able to find other online outlets for their activities. Sheera Frenkel, Mike Isaac and Kate Conger shined a spotlight on how Instagram has become the latest hot spot for anti-Semitic material. A few days after the synagogue shooting, a social network that began as a place to post happy vacation photos was found to be hosting over 11,000 posts with a hashtag that blamed Jews for the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nKara Swisher, who has been covering the tech world for decades, wrote a column for The Times this week where she described how the internet, which promised to promote global harmony, has instead become a tool of hate.\n\nAll in all, it was enough to make at least this reporter long for a time when a new iPad was the thing everything was talking about.\n\nSome other tech stories of note this week:\n\n\u25a0 Nellie Bowles wrote a powerful trio of stories about our troubled relationship with the screens that dominate our lives.

On the other side are people (including me) who believe this story is too simplistic and that, while race played a big role, economic factors did too.\n\nIn a new book, Steven Pearlstein of The Washington Post has a chart that reminds me of this debate.

Washington and Beijing seem to be hunkering down for a protracted conflict, one in which disagreements about trade seem inextricable from broader questions involving geopolitical and technological dominance.\n\nFor Alibaba, the timing is inopportune.\n\nInvestors have already been selling off shares in technology companies on both sides of the Pacific this year. Alibaba stock, which trades in the United States, has lost around 30 percent of its value since June. Other major Chinese internet companies have fared even worse, as fears spread over a frostier regulatory environment for the country\u2019s most vibrant enterprises.\n\nAlibaba has long enjoyed an unmatched grip on how Chinese consumers shop on their phones and computers. Lately, the company has said its future depends on extending its consumer empire into the wider, nondigital world.\n\nThe company now has nearly 80 of its lavish, full-service Hema supermarkets, up from 20 a year ago.

Younger and more liberal voters find little appeal in Mr. Clinton\u2019s reputation for ideological centrism on issues like financial regulation and crime.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that with all the issues he has, he could really be that helpful to the candidates,\u201d said Tamika D. Mallory, an organizer of the Women\u2019s March, who\u2019s now promoting female candidates across the country. \u201cIt would do the Democratic Party well to have Bill Clinton focus on his humanitarian efforts.\u201d\n\nRebecca Kirszner Katz, a veteran Democratic strategist, says many Democrats have reassessed the party\u2019s support for Clinton\u2019s behavior in light of changing views about women, power and sexual misconduct.\n\n\u201cIt was an abuse of power that shouldn\u2019t have happened and if the Clintons can\u2019t accept that fact 20 years later, it\u2019s hard to see how they can be part of the future of the Democratic Party,\u201d said Ms. Katz, who worked as a top strategist on Cynthia Nixon\u2019s bid to unseat Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York this year.\n\nMr. Clinton, 72, currently chairs the board of the Clinton Foundation, helping to promote and manage the philanthropic organization he founded after leaving the White House. Angel Ure\u00f1a, a spokesman for Mr. Clinton, said the former president believes \u201cthis election should be about these times and these candidates.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Clinton is encouraged by the large number of impressive Democrats running for office who are personally telling their stories and laying out their vision for how to get America back on track,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are the people voters need to hear from.\u201d", "(Want to get this briefing by email?

This Monday, 28 new people joined, the group said.\n\nBrad, a 36-year-old math professor, is a founder of the S.R.A.\u2019s North Georgia chapter and a member of the S.R.A.\u2019s central committee. \u201cSome people are scared with what\u2019s going on in the country right now,\u201d he told me. He only recently started carrying a gun, after getting death threats for the socialist organizing he was doing in his small town. \u201cPeople want to be able to protect themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, parts of the radical left fetishized firearms. Back then, some conservatives supported gun control as a way to disarm African-American militants; Ronald Reagan signed a bill banning open carry of loaded weapons when he was governor of California. \u201cThe Black Panthers and other extremists of the 1960s inspired some of the strictest gun control laws in American history,\u201d the U.C.L.A. law professor Adam Winkler wrote in his book, \u201cGunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America.\u201d\n\nSince then, however, gun culture has become virtually synonymous with American conservatism. The National Rifle Association is now perhaps the most powerful Republican lobby in the country, and its rhetoric increasingly echoes that of the apocalyptic far right. Over the last 20 or 30 years, Winkler told me, \u201cnot only has the N.R.A. become more and more associated with the right, but there\u2019s an increasingly militaristic, rebellious tone to the N.R.A. and the gun rights movement.\u201d It\u2019s become, he said, \u201call about arming up to fight the tyranny that\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, most of the left has embraced gun control, something that\u2019s unlikely to change anytime soon. But it was probably inevitable that, as our politics have become more polarized and violent, a nascent left-wing gun culture would emerge.", "The House bill, called the American Health Care Act, had provisions that would have weakened current protections for people with pre-existing illnesses. It would have allowed states to eliminate Obamacare\u2019s rules that health insurance must cover a standard set of benefits, like prescription drugs and mental health care, and its rule that insurance companies must charge the same prices to customers whether they are healthy or sick.\n\nThe House bill created a small pool of money for states to help sick customers who might be shut out of such markets. A majority of House Republicans voted for this bill.\n\nHad this bill become law, the precise results would have depended on the choices by individual states. But the Congressional Budget Office estimated that nearly half of all Americans lived in a state that would have pursued such a waiver from standard benefits. The consequences, the C.B.O. said, would have been coverage that was unaffordable to many with pre-existing illnesses, along with holes in coverage for many serious conditions. For example, someone with a substance-abuse disorder might have lived where plans for people with that condition were very expensive and didn\u2019t include addiction treatment.\n\nThe Senate considered several bills. A majority of Republican senators supported them all. Two would have included slightly different programs that would have allowed states to sidestep Obamacare protections.\n\nNearly every Republican incumbent who is now pledging to protect pre-existing conditions supported one of these measures. That\u2019s true of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who once helped to shut down the entire federal government over a demand that Obamacare be reversed. It is also true of Dana Rohrabacher, a congressman from California, and Martha McSally, a congresswoman running for Senate in Arizona.\n\nPresident Trump has said he continues to back repeal efforts. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said recently that Congress would consider such legislation if Republicans retained their control after the election.\n\nSeveral Republican senators have co-sponsored a bill that would ensure that people with pre-existing illnesses could buy insurance at standard prices if Obamacare were repealed or overturned. But that bill includes a large loophole: Insurers would not have to cover any care related to that condition. That bill is not scheduled for a vote, and the president has not endorsed it.", "When she moved to the United States in 1963 she was about 5 feet tall and weighed 90 pounds.\n\nShe married Michael Gorman and one day confided in him about her looks. \u201cI was embarrassed that I was so small,\u201d she said.\n\nHe encouraged her to go with him to an athletic club, where she began running on an indoor track.\n\nShe learned about a competition to complete the most miles on the track in a month, including a 100-mile race.\n\n\u201cThe first year I stopped at 86 miles,\u201d she said. \u201cI cried.\u201d\n\nShe returned the following year and crushed all 100 miles, then did it again the next three years.\n\nShe went on to compete in other races and is the only woman known to have won the Boston and New York City Marathons twice.

That affects the body\u2019s ability to maintain a fast pace when tired \u2014 unless a runner incorporates speed work and strength training into preparation for races. That is how Meb Keflezighi, who is 43 and retired but toying with a comeback, set a personal record at 38 in 2014 and qualified for the United States Olympic team two years later, beating out plenty of runners a decade younger.\n\nIn addition to running anywhere from 85 to 130 miles each week at varying distance intervals and speeds as they prepared for New York, Abdirahman, Lagat and Barrios spent several afternoons each week in the gym to maintain the strength that age is naturally sapping from them.\n\nIn fact, those workouts have become increasingly common among lay runners, too, which might help explain why more serious runners far below the elite level may be getting faster, too.\n\nEarlier this year, the Boston Athletic Association announced that it needed to lower the qualifying standards for runners trying to qualify for the Boston Marathon. Boston is the rare marathon that requires runners to attain a qualifying time to get a place in the field (unless they take one of the spots reserved for those who raise money for charity).\n\nIn recent years, the race\u2019s organizers have been unable to accept all runners who have met the qualifying standards, which vary by age. In 2017, runners had to be 2 minutes 9 seconds below the qualifying standard. In 2018, they had to be 3:23 lower. For 2019, they will have to have run 4:52 lower. Because of increasing applications and an apparent spike in the number of people running qualifying times in 2018, race organizers lowered qualifying standards for all age groups by five minutes this year, meaning their analysis suggested it wasn\u2019t just younger runners who were getting faster but older ones, too.", "The language in Luca Guadagnino\u2019s remake of the horror film \u201cSuspiria\u201d goes beyond words. His witches speak in movement.\n\nIn one scene, a dancer \u2014 Susie (Dakota Johnson) \u2014 performs in a studio, expelling sharp, sudden breaths as she rises and falls, her arms shooting out like daggers. Another dancer, older and worn down, finds herself locked in a mirrored room; she twitches and contorts as she slams into walls and onto the floor to the sound of her own snapping bones. They protrude through her flesh like splitting seams.\n\nWhat\u2019s stunning about the scene isn\u2019t just the violence (though that is shocking), but how Susie\u2019s movements control the other dancer, and how the energy sweeping through Susie\u2019s body is palpably wild and free.\n\nThe scene also serves as a sly metaphor for what happens when an aging dancer is confronted with a younger, fresher version of herself. There may not be broken bones, but the result can feel just as violent. \u201cIn one room, you see the force of life,\u201d the film\u2019s choreographer, Damien Jalet, said in an interview. \u201cAnd in the other it is the force of destruction.\u201d", "Standing out will require one nonnegotiable quality: the vividness to loosen Trump\u2019s stranglehold on the media. To that end, any serious challenger has to figure out how to tell his or her story in a riveting way.\n\n\u201cHigh emotion\u201d was how Naomi Burton described what a candidate should reach for. She and Nick Hayes run the Detroit firm Means of Production, which helped with the viral biographical video at the center of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s stunning rise. Hayes told me that candidates should be wary of relying on \u201ctraditional commercials, which people are bombarded with on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nTrump tweets to bold if bilious effect. His opponent must also bend social media to his or her will. Many Democratic politicians have been trying to do that, with varying success. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s defense of football players who kneel during the national anthem went as viral as imaginable, and his live streaming of everyday minutiae on Facebook has been the perfect complement to his folksy, hyper-accessible brand. But Senator Cory Booker\u2019s self-described Spartacus moment during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings didn\u2019t quite pan out \u2014 his rebellion was more transparently stagy and less audacious than advertised.\n\nThere\u2019s no exaggerating the hell of jostling for space at the media trough where Trump gorges to the point of bursting. He has shamelessness on his side. Look at last Tuesday: His claim that he might end birthright citizenship through an executive order became the main news story, even though he can do no such thing, almost certainly knows that and was engaged in a political stunt meant to energize the base for the midterms. Some morsels are just too delicious for journalists and pundits not to sup on.\n\nSo there\u2019s pressure on a Democratic challenger not just to communicate memorably but to say memorable things \u2014 i.e., new ones.\n\n\u201cCandidacies need to have a level of originality and ambition,\u201d said Pete Buttigieg, the young mayor of South Bend, Ind., and a rising star in the Democratic Party. He stressed the policy side of this and possible discussions about \u201cwhether guaranteed income is now right \u2014 a more novel idea like that. I think you\u2019re going to hear more people talking about constitutional amendments in a way that we really haven\u2019t since the E.R.A.\u201d Those amendments might touch on the Electoral College, on campaign financing, on voting rights. His point \u2014 a vital one \u2014 was that mere tinkering with the tax code or amorphous job-training proposals are yawners for duller times. They pale beside a border wall and a Muslim ban.", "Ahead of the last election the same people who are now demanding the army chief\u2019s head laid siege to the capital. They were protesting against the government for changing one word in the oath that you are required to take as a member of parliament. This blasphemy brigade was egged on by the media and opposition political parties. Khan, who was the opposition leader at the time, said that his followers were rearing to join the protest. Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, the army\u2019s top commander, said publicly that it couldn\u2019t be expected to use force against its own people, an honorable sentiment with little precedent in Pakistan\u2019s history.\n\nAfter a botched police operation, the army triumphantly negotiated with the protesters, and an agreement was signed conceding many of their demands. The law minister was fired. The word change in the law was changed back. A general was seen distributing 1,000-rupee notes to demonstrators and patting them on the back: Are we not with you? Aren\u2019t we all part of the same brotherhood?\n\nNow those brothers have returned to bite our military and civilian establishment. An arm around the shoulder and some petty cash may be a good law-and-order strategy in some potentially explosive situations. But not when you play politics with the Prophet\u2019s honor.\n\nIt\u2019s almost certain that Bibi will not be able to live in the country after her acquittal. And a lot of people like her are still languishing in cells waiting to be tried. There\u2019s a literature professor, Junaid Hafeez, who has been in jail for the last five years facing bogus blasphemy charges. After he was arrested, his lawyer was shot dead for defending him. His current lawyer can\u2019t be named. Hafeez has to be kept in solitary confinement to protect him from other prisoners who might take it upon themselves himself to avenge the Prophet\u2019s good name.\n\nNow that the prime minister himself is in the righteous\u2019s sight \u2014 protecting a blasphemer may be even graver blasphemy \u2014 and a man even more powerful than him, Bajwa, has been declared kafir, an infidel, one can only hope their respective institutions won\u2019t use the blasphemy card against their perceived enemies. There were about a dozen reported cases of blasphemy between 1927 and 1986, but there have been more than 4,000 since then, when the laws were reinforced.\n\nPakistani liberals are asking the government and the army to go and crush the mullahs and take the country back. It might be more useful to go after these blasphemy laws that seem to be turning all of us into blasphemers.", "Good Friday.

It seems his first hit (\u201chit\u201d being a relative term for him) was a song about the woman in Montreal.\n\nI have no idea what\u2019s happened to her.\n\nI see that I was right to end the affair before it started. I feel sure the poem and the song wouldn\u2019t have been written if he\u2019d put his hand over hers on that long-ago afternoon and she\u2019d answered with a kiss, if they\u2019d had time to reach the irritations and disappointments \u2014 the finger taps on the tabletop, the laundry piles, the uneasy silences \u2014 that are inevitable in our lives but may not be all that helpful where certain love poems are concerned.\n\nI told him to choose the poem about the woman over the woman herself. I don\u2019t regret it. It did get me transferred to Saskatoon, though.\n\nNot that there\u2019s anything wrong with Saskatoon. People call it the Paris of the Prairies, I\u2019m not making that up.\n\nPoems and songs survive. That\u2019s part of why we care about them. Which is why I have no second thoughts, hardly any, about turning the poet away from the woman while she was still a poem to him.\n\nI do wonder, sometimes, what happened to her.

The total number of workers and job searchers is up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the strongest part of the broader economy at the moment,\u201d Michelle Girard, chief United States economist at NatWest Markets, said of the labor market.\n\nA swerving stock market, tariffs and weakening growth in other countries may be causing agita, but they have done little to dent economic momentum in the United States. Employers added 250,000 jobs in October, extending a record streak of growth to 97 months, the Labor Department reported on Friday.\n\nThe economy has historically not played an outsize role in midterm elections, and this political season, border control, health care and Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court have gobbled up airtime and political ad space. Still, about three-quarters of registered voters say the economy is \u201cvery important\u201d in determining their vote, according to polls conducted by the Pew Research Center. Among Republicans, that number is even higher at 85 percent.", "Call it the LeBron James hangover.\n\n\u201cThere was a total dependence on LeBron,\u201d said Larry Drew, the team\u2019s longtime lead assistant, who found himself suddenly elevated to the uncertain position of what the Cavaliers called the \u201cacting\u201d head coach when Lue was fired last weekend. \u201cA total dependence,\u201d he said, to emphasize the point.\n\n\u201cI am not just talking about his talent, but the whole presence,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could sense it just when he walked into the gym. And when that is taken away, when he is gone, it is like, where do you go? The whole organization feels it, has had to deal with it, even the whole city. And that is the struggle.\u201d\n\nSo far, the struggle is real, and it is not going well.\n\nWhen James left Cleveland, for the second time, the team made the conscious decision to make a clean break from its historic superstar (without the bitter rancor that existed between ownership and James following his free-agent signing with the Miami Heat in 2010).\n\nThat massive mural of James that had stretched across the wide flank of a building near Quicken Loans arena? Gone.

That person will have to deal with an open investigation into sexual harassment claims that implicate former bosses and the culture of the company they oversaw. He or she will also have to grapple with a rapidly shifting business landscape and pay attention to the long-term wishes of the controlling owner of CBS, Shari Redstone.\n\nThe industry backdrop is daunting, too. CBS, the most-watched network for the past decade, is still the king of prime time, but it presides over a dwindling empire. Audiences across television have eroded as tech platforms like YouTube, Instagram and Netflix attract more of their time.\n\nRichard D. Parsons, who was leading the board before stepping down last week for medical reasons, had informal discussions with a few executives to gauge their interest in leading CBS. Those executives included the HBO chief Richard Plepler, according to two people with knowledge of the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the conversations were private.\n\nMr. Plepler was not interested, and no formal offers were made, the people said. But the casual approach befits the style of Mr. Parsons, who is known for talking through an idea with a small group before broaching it more widely.", "Welcome to The Tip Sheet, a daily political analysis of the 2018 elections, based on interviews with Republican and Democratic officials, pollsters, strategists and voters.\n\n\u201cIt Could Happen\u201d\n\nPresident Trump, at the rally Friday afternoon in West Virginia, acknowledged four days before the midterm election that Republicans could lose the House.\n\n\u201cIt could happen, could happen.

One contractor did the audit for free; the other offered a free audit and a more extensive test for $250. I went for the more extensive test.\n\nHomeowners are told that there is no obligation to make any of the changes recommended in an audit, but those who get work done can qualify for low- or no-cost loans, and for state rebates based on how much energy they will save by making the recommended changes.\n\nMr. Sheehan said that contractors who are certified and accredited by the state of New Jersey offer free or cheap audits because they know they can pitch homeowners to do the work. Those contractors also become part of a marketing cooperative that provides marketing materials and rebates for some marketing costs.\n\nOn New Jersey\u2019s energy website, njcleanenergy.com, I searched for local contractors, choosing five within a 10-mile radius of my house. Two never got back to me; another left a strange voice mail message. The other two responded to my emails right away, and I scheduled audits with both.\n\nThe audit process itself was relatively simple.\n\nThe contractors asked similar questions about the house, whether I had allergies or asthma and where I felt variations in temperature. They also asked for a copy of my utility bills to see how much energy I was using, as the amount helps determine how much of a rebate I could get from New Jersey. Contractors usually want a full year of bills, but since I had been in the house only since July, they looked at what I had available.\n\nThen they poked around and performed a few basic tests to see where I was losing heated or cooled air. The tests included using a thermal camera to document changes in temperature; identifying which parts of the house bumped out from the main structure; and going into the crawl space, attic and basement to see what kind of insulation (if any) was there. Each audit took about three hours.", "Barnard College, the women\u2019s college in Manhattan that is part of Columbia University, last spring started Beyond Barnard, a major reorganization of its career services office.\n\n\u201cOne thing I realized right off the bat was that we really needed a one-stop shop where students could go to think about their experiences at Barnard outside the classroom, whether it was internships or fellowships, or work-study and a pathway from that to what was next after their time at Barnard,\u201d said Sian Beilock, Barnard\u2019s president since July 2017.\n\nThat the office now reports to the provost and the dean of the college \u201celevates it and tells an important story that this is part of the academic experience,\u201d Dr. Beilock said.\n\nFor Stefani Shoreibah, 19, a sophomore at Barnard who is majoring in art history and also pursuing a premedical path, her campus routine is regularly touched by Beyond Barnard events \u2014 from speaking at a recent STEM Network Panel to personalized academic advising.\n\n\u201cWith advising from Beyond Barnard faculty, this past summer I successfully completed a 10-week paid internship as a student researcher at the Watson Clinic Cancer and Research Center of West Central Florida,\u201d said Ms. Shoreibah, who is from Lakeland, Fla. \u201cThe Beyond Barnard advisers and I developed a strategy to start my undergraduate research at a local medical practice close to my home and branch out from that experience.\u201d\n\nBeyond Barnard will hold more than 2,500 one-on-one advising appointments this year and upward of 125 programs on topics like career exploration and job applications, research opportunities across disciplines and mentoring opportunities that connect students with alumnae, according to Dr. Beilock. \u201cAnd we are committing more than $1 million over the next three years to expand internship opportunities for students.\u201d", "In an election shaped by the #MeToo movement, where female candidates and voters are likely to drive any Democratic gains, Mr. Clinton finds his legacy tarnished by what some in the party see as his inability to reckon with his sexual indiscretions as president with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, as well as with past allegations of sexual assault.

It made us wonder: What novelists were popular 25, 50 and 75 years ago?\n\nWell, 25 years ago, Grisham was. In November 1993, his fourth novel, \u201cThe Client,\u201d had been on the list for 33 weeks. The Times gave it a double-edged review: \u201cOnce again ... Mr. Grisham enraptures us with a story that has hardly any point.\u201d\n\nPlenty of other familiar names joined Grisham on the 1993 list: Stephen King, Danielle Steel, Anne Rice, Ken Follett, Dean Koontz. The top spots, though, were occupied by Robert James Waller. His word-of-mouth hit, \u201cThe Bridges of Madison County,\u201d was at No. 2, having spent 66 weeks on the list, and his follow-up, \u201cSlow Waltz at Cedar Bend,\u201d was at No. 1. The Times was not a fan: \u201c\u2018Slow Waltz at Cedar Bend\u2019 and \u2018The Bridges of Madison County\u2019 are out of the same mold. But the self-conscious preachiness and gaseous prose of the first book have been toned down. Some.\u201d\n\nGo back another 25 years, to November 1968, and the fiction list gets more interesting. No. 1 was Helen MacInnes\u2019s Cold War thriller \u201cThe Salzburg Connection,\u201d which The Times loved \u2014 sort of, admitting that the author \u201chas won and deserved a far wider readership than the average whodunit carpenter.\u201d John Updike\u2019s \u201cCouples\u201d \u2014 derided by many as titillating and graphic \u2014 was No. 4. The Times, however, did not find it salacious. \u201cIf this is a dirty book, then I don\u2019t see how sex can be written about at all,\u201d Wilfrid Sheed wrote in his review. \u201cUpdike\u2019s treatment of sex \u2026 is that of a fictional biochemist approaching mankind with a tray of hypersensitive gadgets.\u201d The paper was a big fan of the novel at No. 8, Charles Portis\u2019s \u201cTrue Grit,\u201d calling it \u201ca western in a yarn-spinning tradition that goes back at least to Mark Twain.\u201d", "VIRGIL WANDER\n\nBy Leif Enger\n\n300 pp. Grove Atlantic. $27.\n\nWhat a wondrous miracle, to wake up, memory muddled, slightly unmoored, with just the task of relearning yourself, your friends, your hometown nestled along the ruggedly beautiful shores of Lake Superior. Everything that once was rundown and rusted suddenly seems new and exotic, buffed to a striking shine.\n\nSuch is the plight of Virgil Wander, who gives Leif Enger\u2019s new novel its name and is one of the most engaging protagonists I\u2019ve encountered in years. Wander is an orphan, a fallen seminarian, a movie-theater owner. After his car plunges off a cliff into the icy waters of the lake below, his memory and capacity for language are compromised.\n\nThe world of fiction has always rewarded the obsession, the fetish, and \u201cVirgil Wander\u201d is jam-packed with such eccentricities \u2014 baseball, surfing, beachcombing, fishing, classic films, taxidermy, Jeep Wagoneers. Reading the novel is like walking into your beloved uncle\u2019s bachelor pad: Every page is packed with curios and brimming with delightful nostalgia. But the nostalgia is well modulated. As Virgil\u2019s memory begins to resolve, so does the glimmer of his small town begin to fade. Greenstone, Minn., is a Rust Belt port, a little pockmark along Highway 61 up to Canada. Is it beautiful? Sure, but mostly because of the lake and seasons. Its monolithic ore dock is an everyday reminder of the town\u2019s decay, as are the vacancies along Main Street and Virgil\u2019s own derelict movie theater.\n\nImage\n\nAgainst this richly drawn background, Enger weaves in a few different strands, including some that explore notions of fatherlessness and orphanhood. Every narrative thread is infused with the magical. Greenstone is a place where phantoms lurk out on the big lake, where old men fly kites into the fangs of lightning and where there\u2019s always an outside chance Bob Dylan might stroll onto the Main Street stage.

She knows that smack in the middle of the river of love in which we hope to swim there\u2019s a rock that will split your shin, and there\u2019s a snake coiled beside that rock. Possibly, you will just die of snakebite but more likely, you will live with venom pouring through your veins, festering and suppurating for the rest of your days. Rosellen Brown knows that regret is more likely than redemption and that people may talk the talk like nobody\u2019s business (and her characters do talk the talk of every liberal American belief and movement of the last 70 years) and still lose their grip on their ideals. Hell, not just \u201cmay.\u201d They are very likely to.\n\nRosellen Brown has a great ear, a great eye, a great love of the painful twists and turns that happen in a human life and the big twists and turns of American history.

And you\u2019ve got to produce some results now.\u201d\n\nThat a purge of hard-right lawmakers had even been considered is a function of the scale of Republican domination in Oklahoma. Long a minority party operating chiefly out of the Chambers of Commerce and Rotary Clubs of Tulsa and Oklahoma City, Republicans went on a partisan land rush over the past couple of decades, winning rural and small town seats that had been in Democratic hands since statehood.\n\n\u201cWhen I got elected it was kind of a fluke,\u201d said Mr. Faught, who in 2006 won a seat in Muskogee that had never been held by a Republican.\n\nWith ever-expanding majorities, longtime Republicans saw a chance to pass long-delayed priorities like tort reform, but the arrivals from the party\u2019s new frontiers came with their own ideas. Lawmakers barely known by the party leaders were now in the headlines for forming a legislative caucus to stamp out the Muslim Brotherhood in Oklahoma or proposing to screen thousands of students for possible deportation.\n\nThis was messy but manageable in the good times. Then the fiscal emergency hit. Party leaders knew they had to come up with a plan, but a vote to raise taxes, already extremely difficult in Oklahoma, was proving next to impossible, even with a supermajority. In March, the House finally, and barely, managed to pass a tax package to pay for teacher raises. Nineteen Republicans voted against it.\n\n\u201cYou had the governing Republicans versus what I call the \u2018Let\u2019s barely keep the doors open\u2019 Republicans,\u201d said Chad Alexander, a former chairman of the state Republican Party. \u201cAnd the Democrats.\u201d\n\nOf those 19 \u2018no\u2019 votes on the tax package, only four are left running in the general election.

The brothers gave Mr. Shrem $250,000 in September 2012, but the lawsuit says that a month later, he delivered only around $189,000 worth of Bitcoin at the going price, which was around $12.50.\n\nThe 5,000 or so missing Bitcoins became a point of tension between the twins and Mr. Shrem. They asked him numerous times for an accounting of the Bitcoins he had purchased and eventually brought in an accountant who documented the missing funds, according to court documents.\n\n\u201cI have been patient, and at this point it\u2019s getting a bit absurd,\u201d Cameron Winklevoss wrote to Mr. Shrem in 2013 in an email quoted in the lawsuit. \u201cI don\u2019t take this lightly.\u201d\n\nThe missing Bitcoins, which were worth 98 percent less at the time, appeared to have been forgotten in a broader battle between the brothers and Mr. Shrem over an investment in Bitinstant.\n\nIn 2013, Bitinstant fell apart, and the twins blocked Mr. Shrem\u2019s efforts to revive the company with new investors because of their concerns about his management style.

There are 23 students on e-sports scholarships at U.C.I. this year, on varsity and junior varsity teams, said Mark Deppe, who runs the university\u2019s e-sports program.\n\nE-sports players at U.C.I. devote 15 to 20 hours a week to the sport, Mr. Deppe said. Players scrimmage other teams, watch Video on Demand footage to evaluate performance, participate in team meetings, sit for biweekly sessions with a team psychologist and work out once a week with a personal trainer. The physical workout is e-sports-inspired: aside from general cardio, routines emphasize strengthening core muscles, arms, shoulders and wrists.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s discipline involved, there\u2019s practice involved, there\u2019s teamwork and collaboration involved, but also the physical aspect,\u201d said Mark Candella, known as Garvey, the director of strategic partnerships for the streaming platform Twitch. \u201cThese young people can do up to 360 controlled precise actions per minute.

I, for one, was hoping the answer would not involve a book aimed at teenagers in which a candidate\u2019s obscene reference to female anatomy appears on Page 2, but that is where we are. In UNPRESIDENTED: A Biography of Donald Trump (Feiwel and Friends, 384 pp., $19.99; ages 12 and up), Martha Brockenbrough provides an encyclopedic tale of the rise of Donald J. Trump. Brockenbrough\u2019s version is, unapologetically, a liberal\u2019s framing of events. Then again, I\u2019m not sure if a nonpartisan book about Trump could grow out of the current climate. For now, there is this thorough, hard-hitting volume that seeks to explain Trump, from the time he was born with a silver spoon and \u201cgolden hair, pink cheeks and a tiny pucker of a mouth,\u201d to his shocker of a presidential campaign (\u201ccandidates typically don\u2019t insult the parents of soldiers who die in combat\u201d).\n\nThe tone isn\u2019t lighthearted, yet I laughed out loud in Chapter 4. Is there any more telling symbol of our bizarre (and yes, unprecedented) times than Roy Cohn appearing prominently in a young adult book, and not one about the bygone days of McCarthyism? Brockenbrough describes Trump\u2019s infamous lawyer and fixer (or \u201cattack dog,\u201d as she calls him) in such stark, terrifying terms that he seems almost like a cartoon villain, a closeted Cruella de Vil \u201cwith weatherworn skin, dark eyes and a nose that looked like it had encountered many fists in his 46 years.\u201d\n\nHalfway through \u201cUnpresidented,\u201d I found myself craving a different type of children\u2019s book, something that would enlighten kids about the current climate, educate them on the historical struggles that got us here, but also offer bipartisan hope. I wanted a respite from the partisan rancor, preferably with appealing illustrations that didn\u2019t include a 2016 Electoral College map.\n\nI found all of this and more in several immersive picture books about women leaders. The standout books of the bunch tell the stories of two remarkable women of color. In WHAT DO YOU DO WITH A VOICE LIKE THAT? (Beach Lane, 48 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8), a biography of Representative Barbara Jordan written by Chris Barton and illustrated by Ekua Holmes, we go from Jordan\u2019s modest upbringing in Houston to her civil rights activism to the halls of Congress and back to Texas after a multiple sclerosis diagnosis takes her out of public life. All the way, Jordan\u2019s distinct \u201cbig, bold, booming, crisp, clear, confident voice\u201d guides us.", "I first came across the name \u201cGilgi\u201d on a page of my grandmother K\u00e4the\u2019s diary from 1932, tucked between mentions of \u201cShanghai Express\u201d with Marlene Dietrich and a performance by the Jewish cabaret star Dela Lipinskaja. \u201cSuch courage!\u201d K\u00e4the wrote, of the character Gilgi. I was curious for any glimpse into my grandmother\u2019s mind during this chapter of her life when she was an expressionist dancer in Hamburg and sported boyish haircuts and berets. She had recently fallen in love with my grandfather Hermann and was summoning the courage to divorce her husband. From Wikipedia I learned that \u201cGilgi\u201d was the first novel by a writer named Irmgard Keun (1905-82), who had been the It Girl of the German literary scene in the final years of the Weimar Republic. Intrigued, I ordered a copy.\n\nWhen I read \u201cGilgi\u201d I was struck by how contemporary the novel feels, with its portrait of a woman fighting to maintain control over her life and her body in a politically polarized society. Gilgi\u2019s experiences of workplace harassment, her scruples about privilege and her unease with the narcotic effects of romantic love are all colored by Keun\u2019s left-leaning politics. But they\u2019re sketched with a light hand: This is a beach-worthy read with a social conscience.\n\nA female Times reviewer in 1932, praising the novel\u2019s \u201cwholesome freshness,\u201d noted that \u201ccountless hard-working, industrious, healthy young girls recognized themselves in the heroine.\u201d I suspect many members of our #MeToo generation will do so as well.\n\n[ Read the paper\u2019s original review of \u201cGilgi.\u201d ]\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to trace the parallels between our time and those interwar years without thinking of what came next: a vicious backlash against female freedom and ruthless suppression of the open society that had made it possible.", "Now comes Albert Samaha, a first-time author, with \u201cNever Ran, Never Will.\u201d Whether deliberately or by coincidence, he has set himself an especially daunting task, because his book about two seasons with a youth football team takes place in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, just down Linden Boulevard from Telander\u2019s Flatbush, and considers in almost identical ways how sports impacts the lives of young, nonwhite, often at-risk players. Does a game like football offer lifesaving discipline, fatherly coaches and means to a scholarship? Or is it just a cruel chimera, holding out the allure of an elusive pro career? And, to add a very current concern, is the risk of a head injury at a tender age worth the potential rewards of stardom?\n\nImage\n\nIn plumbing these profound questions, Samaha immerses himself with the Mo Better Jaguars for the 2013 and 2014 seasons. Even though the Jaguars\u2019 three teams extend only from ages 7 to 13, existential consequences hang over their efforts. The team\u2019s head coach, Chris Legree, who was motivated to found the Jaguars by his participation in the Million Man March, has sent four players into the N.F.L., others to college scholarships at top-rung football schools like Syracuse, and dozens to scholarships at elite private high schools like Poly Prep. But despite his ardent, paternal efforts, which Samaha captures vividly, Legree has also watched about 30 former players end up in prison. One of Legree\u2019s best players ever was shot dead at age 19.\n\nAs Legree tells one player who shows signs of choosing the street over the gridiron: \u201cYou ain\u2019t the first guy. I\u2019ve been around guys like you a lot of years and I know the signs. I\u2019m always worried about you getting hooked up with the wrong people. You could get out of it and get on the right track, but you gotta be honest with me and I got to know what you want. Some guys don\u2019t wanna be helped. The coaches, they were looking for you the other day. Because I think you got a future. You got a chance. But no one wants to deal with problems. Courts, cops, gangs, stealing, drugs.\u201d\n\nA former college football player who now reports on criminal justice for BuzzFeed, Samaha brings empathy and scrutiny to his reporting. But his book suffers from structural problems and an inexplicable lapse in ethical judgment when it comes to identifying his characters. Sadly, these problems all could have been rectified with a firmer editing hand.\n\nThe 2014 season supplies the core of the book\u2019s drama, yet Samaha devotes the first 70-plus pages to the essentially ephemeral 2013 games. Some of his finest character portraits of coaches and parents turn up only toward the book\u2019s end. It\u2019s also hard to understand why Samaha uses only partial names or nicknames for all of the players \u2014 even though, in a recent essay for The Times, he was perfectly capable of fully identifying several of the Jaguars and even using their photographs.", "In the authors\u2019 approving view, men like the banker John Pierpont Morgan, the oil baron John D. Rockefeller and the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, all born within a few years of one another in the 1830s, were \u201cgiants of energy and ambition\u201d who \u201cexercised more power than anybody other than kings or generals had exercised before.\u201d These men (and they were all men) are \u201cheroes of creative destruction\u201d because they \u201chelped to produce a massive improvement in living standards for all.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThat they also produced social and economic upheaval for many is a small price to pay, the authors contend. The rise of their great corporations, not to mention the industries they helped build and finance, from railroads to autos to retail chains like Sears, Roebuck, displaced millions of workers and small-business owners who were rendered obsolete. Cyrus McCormack\u2019s threshing machine displaced a quarter of the world\u2019s agricultural workers. \u201cPeople seldom achieve great things without being willing to ride roughshod over the opposition,\u201d the authors note.\n\nNot surprisingly, these \u201cgiants\u201d attracted popular hostility and resentment \u2014 Teddy Roosevelt called them \u201cmalefactors of great wealth.\u201d Their success and attendant wealth unleashed a populist backlash. Williams Jennings Bryan campaigned against Wall Street and its \u201ccross of gold.\u201d Congress passed the first antitrust laws. The first federal income tax paved the way to income redistribution.\n\nHistory\u2019s harsh judgment of the era (which culminated in the 1929 stock market crash and ensuing Great Depression) suggests why creative destruction has had trouble gaining much of a following. Like the Robber Barons, today\u2019s drivers of creative destruction, technology and internet entrepreneurs, \u201care seldom the easiest of heroes, nor the nicest,\u201d the authors note. \u201cThey will sacrifice anything, from their own peace of mind to the lives of those around them, to build a business empire and then protect that business empire from destruction.\u201d Such people are prone \u201cto what the Norwegians call Stormannsgalskap, or the \u2018madness of great men.\u2019\u201d Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk, who merits several approving mentions, comes to mind. The disruptive forces they unleash generate \u201cunease: the fiercer the gale the greater the unease.\u201d\n\nAnd not all destruction, it should be said, is creative. In a nod to the exotic derivatives and mortgage-backed securities that led to the Great Recession (and went largely undetected by Greenspan\u2019s Fed), Greenspan and Wooldridge acknowledge that \u201ccreative destruction can sometimes be all destruction and no creation.\u201d\n\nThe popular reaction is typically a well-intentioned but misguided effort to preserve the status quo. \u201cPeople link arms to protect threatened jobs and save dying industries. They denounce capitalists for their ruthless greed. The result is stagnation: In trying to tame the creative destruction, for example by preserving jobs or keeping factories open, they end up killing it,\u201d the authors contend.\n\nIn their view, America today is already well along that path to stagnation. \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d barely mentions Trump beyond condemning his \u201cdangerous\u201d trade policies and warning about the fiscal recklessness of his tax cuts. But the entire book is an indictment of Trump\u2019s stands on immigration and protectionism and his attempts to resurrect fading mining and industrial concerns \u2014 attempts that, as \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d shows repeatedly, are almost surely doomed.", "THE KING AND THE CATHOLICS\n\nEngland, Ireland, and the Fight for Religious Freedom, 1780-1829\n\nBy Antonia Fraser\n\nIllustrated. 319 pp. Nan A. Talese/ Doubleday. $29.95.\n\nWhen Amazon Prime finally starts delivering to heaven, Evelyn Waugh should order a copy of Antonia Fraser\u2019s new book, \u201cThe King and the Catholics: England, Ireland, and the Fight for Religious Freedom, 1780-1829.\u201d Fraser\u2019s latest considers a topic close to Waugh\u2019s tart heart: bleak Roman Catholic prospects in aggressively Anglican England. The reference to religious freedom in the book\u2019s subtitle suggests why more earthly readers would find the book of interest, but, refreshingly, Fraser makes no effort to convince us that a centuries-old story of religious and political conflicts and competing minority rights remains relevant. Such confidence is rare today, given the easy temptation to gravely invoke Brexit and ISIS and Donald Trump and the Vatican. Instead, Fraser trusts that we can make the germane connections \u2014 or not. As far as she\u2019s concerned, the story matters anyway.\n\nImage\n\n\u201cThe King and the Catholics\u201d isn\u2019t as magisterial as \u201cMary Queen of Scots\u201d or as flat-out exciting as \u201cFaith and Treason: The Story of the Gunpowder Plot.\u201d Instead, it\u2019s a convincing and worthy addition to the already impressive Fraser corpus. It opens boldly. \u201cThe story begins with violence: In the summer of 1780 London was the scene of the worst riots the city had ever experienced.\u201d About 1,000 people died, and \u201cthe physical damage to the structure of the city would not be surpassed until the Blitz in the Second World War.\u201d The riots were a reaction to the Catholic Relief Act, passed two years before under George III, which proposed to repeal measures that had been in place since the Jesuit martyr Edmund Campion\u2019s day, including the arrest and imprisonment of Catholic priests and teachers, and the prohibition against Catholics purchasing land. A new Oath of Allegiance, featuring a repudiation of the pope\u2019s temporal authority and prayers for the king, was also included, but this didn\u2019t mollify the act\u2019s opponents, elite Protestants who stirred up popular resistance that was in turn fed by \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d-worthy rumors, including one declaring the presence of \u201c20,000 Jesuit priests lurking in the tunnels beneath the Thames, only waiting for orders from Rome to blow up the banks and bed of the river in order to flood the whole of London.\u201d There were no more than 80,000 Catholics in England at the time, in a population of seven million.", "Q. What is the evidence that dietary cholesterol or other fat influences serum cholesterol?\n\nA. Foods high in cholesterol, like eggs or cheese, can raise blood cholesterol levels, though the effect is relatively modest and varies from person to person. The best evidence available suggests that saturated fat, rather than dietary cholesterol per se, is the major contributor to serum cholesterol.\n\nIn 1991, The New England Journal of Medicine described the case of an 88-year-old man who ate 25 eggs a day for at least 15 years and had normal cholesterol levels and apparently normal arteries. This report challenged a central dogma of medicine: namely, that dietary cholesterol leads to elevated serum cholesterol and atherosclerosis. That belief arose in 1913, when the Russian scientist Nikolai Anichkov observed that rabbits developed atherosclerosis after being fed a high-cholesterol diet.\n\nOver the years, the association between diet and atherosclerotic plaque grew, but controversy grew as well. Critics noted that rabbits do not consume cholesterol in the wild, and humans do not consume cholesterol in isolation. The vast majority of foods that are high in cholesterol, like steak or butter, are also high in saturated fats. Notable exceptions to this rule are egg yolks and shellfish, such as shrimp, lobster and crab.\n\nIn 1965, a landmark Harvard study \u2014 one which could not be replicated today because of evolving ethical standards, as it was performed on schizophrenic patients confined to a mental hospital \u2014 showed that saturated fat exerted a greater effect on serum cholesterol than dietary cholesterol did. Subsequent studies supported this conclusion, including the 20-year Western Electric Study of 1,900 men from 1981 and an analysis of 395 experiments that appeared in the British Medical Journal in 1997.", "Fortunately for publishers and my library, unread books remind me of the many pleasures to come.

The Tibetan government in exile, which is based in the northern Indian town of Dharamsala, credited him with Congress\u2019s passage of the Tibet Policy Act in 2002. The law guides American policy over Tibet, encouraging dialogue between exiled Tibetans and the Chinese authorities with the goal of protecting Tibetans\u2019 distinct identity.\n\nLodi Gyaltsen Gyari was born in 1949 in Nyarong, a Tibetan district that is now in western Sichuan Province. He was recognized as a rinpoche, or reincarnated lama, and educated as a child in the traditional monastic system of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nHe became active in the cause of Tibetan independence as a young man in exile in India, and at one point was recruited to work as a translator for a C.I.A. effort to train Tibetan fighters. But he went into journalism instead, editing a Tibetan-language newspaper and then an English-language publication that became The Tibetan Review.\n\nIn 1970 he co-founded the Tibetan Youth Congress, which is now the largest Tibetan exile organization seeking independence from China. But his own position became more moderate, and as he held increasingly prominent positions within the exile government, including speaker of Parliament and cabinet member, he became a leading advocate of the Dalai Lama\u2019s Middle Way.\n\nMr. Gyari traveled to China in 1982 and 1984 as part of Tibetan delegations that held exploratory talks with officials. He later said that the Chinese government\u2019s deadly crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 had frightened the Chinese leadership, inhibiting political liberalization and the possibility of a changed relationship with Tibet.\n\nIn a 2014 talk, Mr. Gyari said he still felt some optimism despite decades of unsuccessful negotiations with the Chinese. Xi Zhongxun, the father of China\u2019s current leader, Xi Jinping, had met with the Dalai Lama in the 1950s, and the Tibetan leader had given him a luxury watch that he showed to Mr. Gyari during their meeting in 1982. Mr. Gyari hoped that Xi Jinping had inherited some of his father\u2019s affinity for Tibet.\n\n\u201cThose 30 years have been challenging and disappointing \u2014 disappointing because I left the responsibility without really making any major breakthrough,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, those 30 years of dealing with the Chinese government in some ways have deepened my heart and given me some hope.\u201d", "1 of 11\n\nEleven people were killed at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, one of the deadliest attacks against the Jewish community on U.S. soil.\n\nWhat is the name of the synagogue?", "bad url", "\u201cOne of the hardest things to do is to make a successful musical,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean financially successful, I mean artistically.

When they\u2019re all working in tandem, I do not think there is a more thrilling art form, full stop.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, the challenge of creating those moments becomes even greater onscreen. \u201cWhen you make a movie musical, the suspension of disbelief is much higher and it\u2019s harder to buy people singing,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because the settings are more realistic, but when someone bursts into song in a movie, for some reason we really have to earn it.\u201d\n\nAnd still more art forms have to work together with film: \u201cYou\u2019re adding cinematography, and you\u2019re adding camera movement so it\u2019s even harder to make the magic trick, but when it does it\u2019s even more powerful.\u201d\n\nWhat do those moments look like?

The party understands that its fortunes depend on an increasingly threatened British nationalism.\n\nUnionism is dying in Northern Ireland. During the 30-year war, the Protestant majority was mostly loyal, even though Northern Ireland was one of the the poorest parts of the United Kingdom. With a dwindling industrial base, it was subsidized by war, infused with money for an occupying army and giant, garrisoned stations full of police officers.\n\nWhen I was growing up in the 1980s, in a small Protestant town in the east of the six counties, Protestants could believe that those men of violence were there for us, that the Union was ours.

I recall that one year during my childhood, members of a local Loyalist flute band stabbed a Catholic bus driver repeatedly; a woman tried to stanch the bleeding by wrapping him in towels, but when the ambulance arrived, he was dead. We heard this story on the radio, on the way back from watching a parade. Many paid with blood for Protestant loyalty to Britain.", "The morning of my wedding, I woke up looking grotesque.\n\nI could hardly open my eyes because my eyelids were so swollen. In despair, I called out to Damian, my soon-to-be-husband. Then we called my doctor, who said, \u201cLooks like your bone marrow transplant came to your wedding.\u201d\n\nI had received a bone-marrow transplant several years earlier, which vanquished the leukemia in my blood and saved my life. But my new immune system sometimes went haywire. Submerging myself in the hotel bathtub the night before with a moist, fragrant washcloth over my eyes had probably been a bad idea; it likely vexed my sensitive system.\n\nOr maybe this was caused by stress? It hurt to look at myself. Why did my body have to go rogue today of all days?\n\nJust two and a half years before, I didn\u2019t think this day would happen. At lunch with my mother, I said, \u201cMom, I\u2019m probably not going to find a partner.\u201d I was 30 then and full-body irradiation had made me infertile. \u201cI\u2019m not what guys are looking

"In life, drama queens, those extravagantly emotional beings who suck up all the oxygen in a room, are fatiguing souls, to be avoided at all costs when one is tired. But, ah, in fiction \u2014 in books and film, and especially on the stage \u2014 these same creatures can be an energizing joy, as stimulating as four shots of espresso.\n\nThat\u2019s why I am advising you to make the acquaintance of a grade-A specimen of this spectacular genus, whose presence is overflowing the Helen Hayes Theater. His undramatic name is Arnold Beckoff, though he also goes by the more promising moniker of Virginia Ham. And, as embodied by Michael Urie in the happy revival of Harvey Fierstein\u2019s \u201cTorch Song,\u201d which opened on Thursday night, Arnold is just the guy and gal to pull you out of your election-season weariness.\n\nHe may also cause you to shed a few sentimental tears, but isn\u2019t that what you expect of a drama queen? And wait until you meet Arnold\u2019s mother, who is played, if you please, by Mercedes Ruehl.\n\nThough a slender fellow, Mr. Urie reads so exultantly big in this production that you almost forget the man who indelibly created Arnold. That\u2019s Mr. Fierstein, the author and original star of \u201cTorch Song Trilogy,\u201d as it was known when it shook up Broadway in the early 1980s, copping Tony Awards for best play and best leading actor in a play.", "The lawsuit, which was filed in 2016, said the episode occurred at a swing that was hanging from a tree and had a separate rope used to pull it higher. The girl said she was standing to the side when she felt the rope pulled around her neck, violently jerking her to the ground.\n\nThe girl said her classmates had bullied her before the school trip, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe family\u2019s lawyer, Levi G. McCathern II, said that he saw race as playing a role in the school\u2019s failure to notify the girl\u2019s parents after the episode. \u201cIf it had been a little white girl they would have been on the phone with her mother within the hour,\u201d he said on Thursday.\n\nDavid N. Deaconson, the lawyer for the school, rejected the assertion that the girl\u2019s injury was a result of bullying and that the school\u2019s response had anything to do with race. He said the school recognized that it erred in failing to call the girl\u2019s mother after her daughter was injured and in not having a chaperone with the children playing at the swing.\n\nMr. Deaconson has described the scene this way: Several children were pulling on the rope to raise the swing into the air, he said, and when they let go, the rope whipped past the girl and hit her in the neck.\n\nOn Wednesday, the jury for the court in Travis County ordered the school to pay $55,000 for the girl\u2019s physical pain and mental anguish, $10,000 for disfigurement sustained during the episode and $3,000 for medical expenses. The verdict was not unanimous; one juror disagreed, but the court documents did not say why.", "HOUSTON \u2014 Two years ago, the presidential election hinged in large part on a rightward shift among working-class whites who deserted Democrats.\n\nTuesday\u2019s House election may turn on an equally significant and opposite force: a generational break with the Republican Party among educated, wealthier whites \u2014 especially women \u2014 who like the party\u2019s pro-business policies but recoil from President Trump\u2019s divisive language on race and gender.\n\nRather than seeking to coax voters like these back into the Republican coalition, Mr. Trump appears to have all but written them off, spending the final days of the campaign delivering a scorching message about preoccupations like birthright citizenship and a migrant \u201cinvasion\u201d from Mexico that these voters see through as alarmist.\n\nIn Republican-leaning districts that include diverse populations or abut cities that do \u2014 from bulwarks of Sunbelt conservatism like Houston and Orange County, Calif., to the well-manicured bedroom communities outside Philadelphia and Minneapolis \u2014 the party is in danger of losing its House majority next week because Mr. Trump\u2019s racially-tinged nationalism has alienated these voters who once made up a dependable constituency.", "\u201c\u6709\u65f6\u4f60\u4f1a\u5728\u591c\u91cc\u6beb\u65e0\u7f18\u6545\u5730\u54ed\u3002\u201d\u4e00\u540d\u8131\u5317\u7684\u5973\u5546\u8d29\u8bf4\u3002\u90a3\u4e9b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u8b66\u536b\u6216\u8005\u8b66\u5b98\u4f1a\u628a\u5979\u558a\u5230\u5e02\u573a\u5916\u7684\u7a7a\u623f\u95f4\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u4ed6\u4eec\u9009\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u5730\u65b9\u3002\u5979\u7684\u4e08\u592b\u5bf9\u6b64\u6beb\u65e0\u529e\u6cd5\u3002\u9003\u8dd1\u7684\u4e5f\u6709\uff0c\u53ef\u4e00\u65e6\u88ab\u6293\uff0c\u7b49\u5728\u9762\u524d\u7684\uff0c\u540c\u6837\u662f\u6765\u81ea\u8b66\u5b98\u548c\u706b\u8f66\u67e5\u7968\u5458\u7684\u6027\u4fb5\u72af\u3002\n\n\u5728\u671d\u9c9c\uff0c\u5b98\u5458\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u5fc3\u6240\u6b32\u5730\u5ba3\u5e03\u5973\u6027\u7684\u51fa\u884c\u548c\u4ea4\u6613\u975e\u6cd5\uff0c\u6ca1\u6536\u5979\u4eec\u7684\u5546\u54c1\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5c06\u5979\u4eec\u9001\u8fdb\u76d1\u72f1\u3002\u6027\u80c1\u8feb\u51e0\u4e4e\u6210\u4e86\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u7537\u4eba\u4e0d\u89c9\u5f97\u6709\u9519\uff0c\u5973\u4eba\u751a\u81f3\u63a5\u53d7\u4e86\u5b83\u30022008\u5e74\u8fd9\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u4ec5\u67099\u4eba\u88ab\u5224\u5f3a\u5978\u7f6a\uff0c2011\u5e74\u67097\u4eba\uff0c2015\u5e74\u51cf\u5c11\u5230\u4e865\u4eba\u3002\n\n_____\n\n\n\n\u2022 \u5173\u4e8e\u4e2d\u671f\u9009\u4e3e\uff0c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u77e5\u9053\u7684\u4e00\u5207", "ATLANTA \u2014 President Trump disparaged Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia, in ambiguous and unusually personal terms on Thursday, warning that \u201cher past\u201d left her \u201cnot qualified to be the governor.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump did not elaborate and offered no evidence for his assertion, which seemed to be a potential preview of the political message he will deliver on Sunday, two days ahead of the election, at a Georgia rally for Brian Kemp, Ms. Abrams\u2019s Republican rival.\n\nBut the decision of the president, who has been criticized for inflammatory language, to invoke Ms. Abrams\u2019s background so broadly was a distinct escalation in his attacks on her bid to become the first black woman to be elected governor in the United States. Ms. Abrams, a former Democratic leader of the Georgia House of Representatives, has staked out an array of liberal positions during her campaign, but her tenure in the Legislature has drawn measured praise from the Republicans who led the State Capitol.\n\nMr. Trump had previously attacked Ms. Abrams on Twitter, but he had not made any overt references to her background until Thursday.", "what trump said\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not letting them into our country.

Data from the Justice Department shows that most immigrants do, in fact, show up to their court hearings.\n\nIn the 2017 fiscal year, about 28 percent of immigrants failed to attend their court hearings \u2014 not the 97 percent Mr. Trump estimated.\n\nAmong asylum seekers, only 11 percent did not show up for legal proceedings. Of the asylum seekers who participated in a pilot program tested as an alternative to detention, 99 percent attended Immigration and Custom Enforcement check-ins and appointments. And 100 percent turned up for court hearings.\n\nThe Trump administration ended the pilot program last June.\n\nwhat trump said\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t get any Democrat votes to change them.

Polls show a tight race between Ms. Abrams and Brian Kemp, the Republican nominee.\n\nThe entire encounter lasted eight to 10 minutes. Ms. Jones said it was somewhat surreal to have Oprah Winfrey (and her rather large entourage) on the lawn of her quiet suburban street. Then again, part of the Oprah mystique is that after someone does a double-take after seeing her in person, she just seems to get on with the business of being a normal human. You open the door, and there she is canvassing, clipboard in hand, and maybe you give a wild yawp of recognition and excitement.\n\nThen again, such audiences do not come every day, and Ms. Jones made the most of it. She told Ms. Winfrey about a speech she saw her give at the Kennedy Center, and how it had brought tears to her eyes and made her think that maybe the problems of race and politics in this troubled country really can improve.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I hope you run in 2020,\u2019\u201d Ms Jones recalls saying. \u201cShe said, \u2018No, no.\u2019\u201d", "The chairman of the University System of Maryland\u2019s Board of Regents announced his resignation Thursday, a stunning turnabout barely 48 hours after the board recommended that the University of Maryland\u2019s head football coach D.

Brady, and the university\u2019s president, Wallace D. Loh, announced on Tuesday that Mr. Durkin would stay on despite the death of one of his players, who experienced heatstroke during a practice in the spring, and a report detailing cultural problems in the football program.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Brady said that he had become an untenable distraction. \u201cI have become the public face of both the board and its decisions related to these matters,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a separate statement, the board acknowledged that Mr. Loh had ultimately rejected its recommendation to retain Mr. Durkin when he fired him on Wednesday. At the news conference on Tuesday announcing that the coach would stay, Mr. Loh said he accepted the board\u2019s recommendation, but he was visibly unenthusiastic about the decision. Mr. Loh also announced that he would retire at the end of the academic year.", "One of the pleasures and challenges of this job is you do a lot of traveling.

In urban and suburban America, Donald Trump\u2019s outrage du jour is on everybody\u2019s lips: Did you see what he tweeted now? Did you see his racist ad? Where will the Mueller investigation go?\n\nIn rural America, by contrast, all that stuff is like a thunderstorm in Inner Mongolia. It\u2019s something happening very far away with no particular relevance here, and so no one\u2019s paying much attention.\n\nIn urban America people talk about Trump constantly. In rural America people generally avoid the subject.

The country became a democracy only in 1 989. And government advertising for everything from the national lottery to the state opera is still a key source of revenue for media companies, and has long been doled out to friends.\n\nStill, journalists I met in Budapest were struck by how quickly the press had changed, and that all it took to break this pillar of democracy was a combination of money and fear. \u201cIt\u2019s not Russia,\u201d Csaba Lukacs told me. \u201cNo one thinks that someone will be shot. Everyone thinks that he will lose his job. It\u2019s enough.\u201d\n\nMr. Lukacs was a senior reporter at Magyar Nemzet, an 80-year-old daily newspaper that closed in April. (Its government advertising evaporated after its owner broke with Mr. Orban.)\n\nIn May, Mr. Lukacs and two dozen former colleagues started a weekly called Magyar Hang (Hungarian Voice), which operates out of a one-room Budapest storefront. Most of its issues have no advertisements, because companies fear drawing the government\u2019s ire by association, Mr. Lukacs said.

He has distanced himself from the national Republican Party, saying he wrote in the name of former Representative Chris Gibson in the 2016 presidential election rather than vote for Donald Trump. The father of a daughter with special needs, he has focused on advocating for the rights of people with disabilities. He has criticized the state\u2019s high tax rates, a significant burden for many New Yorkers. He has embraced the ambitious rescue plan for the city\u2019s subway system put forward by the New York City Transit chief, Andy Byford, and has proposed far-reaching ethics reform, including an initiative to create an independent redistricting body for the state.\n\nHis legislative record , however, presents few signs of the centrist politics he has recently espoused.\n\nWhile in the State Assembly, from 2007 to 2011, Mr. Molinaro voted against limiting access to firearms for domestic abusers. He voted against sensible rent regulations several times. He voted against a measure that would have stopped the shackling of pregnant prisoners while in labor. He opposed Mr. Cuomo\u2019s signature gun safety law. He says he has evolved on gay marriage, which he voted against while in the State Legislature but now sees as a civil right. He also voted against a proposal to allow unmarried partners to adopt a child.\n\nNew York is best served by robust democratic competition, with healthy political parties guaranteeing voters a true choice at the polls. But Mr. Molinaro\u2019s record puts him far out of line with the views of the average New Yorker. His aversion to raising taxes also risks hampering the effort to repair the subway. And while split control of government might be seen as a way to force effective compromise, more often over the years in Albany it has provided excuses for stalemate and inaction.\n\nVoters will be best served by casting their ballots for Mr. Cuomo. He is better positioned to lead this diverse, dynamic state, particularly at a time in which too many of its residents \u2014 immigrants, minorities and the poor and middle class \u2014 are under attack from a hostile administration in Washington.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Mr. Cuomo seeks to leave a lasting legacy in New York. To do so, he will need to keep his campaign promises.\n\nFixing the subway, and finding the political will to pay for the repairs, is the most urgent task before him. That will mean working with legislative leaders to find the votes to approve congestion pricing, to pay for the biggest chunk of the subway fixes.", "Yet Riley, then coaching the Lakers, repeatedly found a forward to start ahead of McAdoo, who had established a league record by winning three scoring titles in Buffalo before he turned 25 \u2014 but who had also found himself increasingly painted with the \u201cselfish\u201d label as injuries and ringless seasons piled up. The famed Boston Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach, in one instance, told The New York Times: \u201cBob was more concerned with personal achievements than team achievements.\u201d\n\nCheckered stints with the Celtics, the Detroit Pistons and the New Jersey Nets led McAdoo to the Lakers \u2014 only for Jim Brewer, Mark Landsberger and ultimately Kurt Rambis to get turns starting ahead of the league\u2019s 1975 most valuable player.\n\n\u201cBut I dealt with it,\u201d McAdoo said, \u201cbecause I had never been on a championship team. And I\u2019ve never been one to cause disruption or anything like that. I wasn\u2019t happy about it. But what could I do? I was frustrated for four years, but I dealt with it. I never said anything. But I was frustrated with the whole deal.\u201d\n\nDuring the 1982 playoffs, his first postseason with the Lakers, McAdoo was quoted by The Washington Post as saying: \u201cThat championship is the one thing I don\u2019t have \u2026 I\u2019ll do whatever I need to ... get it.\u201d By consistently biting his tongue in the moment and only expounding on that frustration years after the fact, McAdoo highlighted the mind-set that not only won Riley\u2019s eternal respect for his sacrifice but also led the game\u2019s historians to view his career with the sort of appreciation and reverence that Anthony has only found on the international stage.\n\nOlympic Melo has won plaudits for his role in helping U.S.A. Basketball secure gold medals in 2008, 2012 and 2016, but he\u2019ll have to be a positive force on an N.B.A. title team like Eighties McAdoo if he hopes to really change his on-court legacy.\n\nPinning the Rockets\u2019 1-5 start on Anthony, mind you, would be grossly unfair. For starters, there have been no indications that he\u2019s putting up any resistance to what D\u2019Antoni has asked to him to do. Furthermore, Chris Paul has missed two games because of a suspension, while James Harden remains out with a hamstring strain as the most notable of multiple Houston injuries.

But the notion that a major party\u2019s presidential candidate would go beyond spin to outright lies still seemed outrageous, and saying it was considered beyond the pale.\n\nObviously that prohibition no longer holds on this opinion page, and major media organizations have become increasingly willing to point out raw falsehoods. But they\u2019ve been chasing a moving target, because the lies just keep getting bigger and more pervasive. In fact, at this point the G.O.P.\u2019s campaign message consists of nothing but lies; it\u2019s hard to think of a single true thing Republicans are running on.\n\nAnd yes, it\u2019s a Republican problem (and it\u2019s not just Donald Trump). Democrats aren\u2019t saints, but they campaign mostly on real issues, and generally do, in fact, stand for more or less what they claim to stand for. Republicans don\u2019t.

I think the idea really emanated from what happened the week before, because it focused everyone\u2019s attention on the fact we went through another type of attack.\u201d\n\nMr. de Blasio appeared to be referring to the delivery a week ago of pipe bombs to the Manhattan offices of CNN and the actor Robert De Niro, as well as to prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump around the country; and the shooting in the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, in which 11 Jewish worshipers were killed.\n\nMr. de Blasio\u2019s press secretary, Eric F.

Wearing helmets, flak vests and battle fatigues, they crouched on their knees and aimed military-style rifles at various points in the distance. As a woman who had just crossed over the bridge stopped to record the scene on her cellphone, the helicopter landed again; the officers formed a line, ran inside and were gone.\n\nThe first wave of the new Army deployment President Trump has ordered at the southern border?\n\nNot quite.\n\nThe helicopter and the officers were with the Border Patrol\u2019s parent agency, Customs and Border Protection. But as thousands of soldiers prepared to deploy to South Texas and other points along the border as part of Mr. Trump\u2019s mobilization of active-duty troops, the training drill was a sign of a new hardening of the border slowly taking shape involving multiple agencies, not just the Army.", "Now we need to ban the use of lead bullets for hunting.\n\nFor centuries, lead has been the ideal metal for bullets because of its weight, density and availability. Where I live in Virginia, nearby lead mines supplied much of the ore for the bullets used in the Revolutionary War.\n\nToday w e have the technology to make highly effective bullets with other, safer metals like copper, and this technology has answered many hunter objections. These bullets are also lethal and accurate, though admittedly more expensive .\n\nIn California, hunters have been required to use non-lead bullets for the past 10 years in territory frequented by the critically endangered California condor, which faced a significant threat from lead poisoning that continues. Next July, California will become the first state to ban the use of lead bullets to hunt wildlife, though about a half-dozen states already require some form of \u201cnontoxic ammunition\u201d for hunting in certain circumstances.\n\nThe Obama administration, in its waning days in 2016, imposed a ban on the use of lead ammunition and fishing tackle on federal lands and waters, arguing that exposure to them \u201chas resulted in harmful effects to fish and wildlife species.\u201d But President Trump\u2019s interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, quickly rescinded the ban, which was opposed by the National Rifle Association and hunting groups, writing that the order was \u201cnot mandated by any existing statutory or regulatory requirement.\u201d\n\nHe was wrong to do that. And no, fellow hunters, this is not about taking away our guns or protecting Bambi or outlawing hunting. This is about protecting and ensuring the health of the wild world on which we depend.\n\nAnd not just the health of the wild world. One 2009 study in the journal PLOS One found that people risked exposure to lead when they ate venison from deer killed with standard lead-based rifle bullets and processed under normal commercial procedures. That same year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found in a study that among 736 people in North Dakota tested for lead, those who ate wild game had 50 percent more lead in their blood and those who did not. Critics at the time complained these were based on small sample sizes, but the co-author of the C.D.C. study nonetheless recommended that pregnant women should not eat wild game.\n\nIn the United States, hunters number over 11 million . We all have a responsibility to protect what we love. To protect our children, we outlawed lead paint. To keep the air we breathe healthy, we got rid of lead in our gasoline. We should do the same with bullets to protect our wildlife. The lead has got to go.\n\n\n\nJim Minick teaches at Augusta University and is the author of five books.\n\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion).", "Patrick Chappatte is an editorial cartoonist for The New York Times.

He also branded those who invoked their constitutional rights not to testify as \u201cFifth Amendment Communists.\u201d These disgraceful tactics ended in McCarthy\u2019s own disgrace after he was censured by the Senate in 1954.\n\nMcCarthy would cheer the methods of today\u2019s Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee. They have conducted much of their business through so-called confidential interviews and depositions that are not public, binding witnesses to silence while lawmakers leak selectively from the testimony.\n\nRepublicans have used this practice to wreck reputations and careers. They have gratuitously exposed the private lives of dedicated civil servants. They have deprived Americans of some of the nation\u2019s most dogged, experienced crime fighters, falsely accusing whistle-blowers of criminal wrongdoing and mocking their invocation of constitutional rights.\n\nA senior F.B.I. lawyer, Lisa Page, was forced to resign after being pilloried by House Republicans. A senior F.B.I. counterintelligence agent, Peter Strzok, was fired for his texts with Ms. Page , but not before enduring crude questioning about his personal life by a Republican congressman, Louie Gohmert. Committee attacks on Bruce Ohr led to his removal as associate deputy attorney general. His wife, Nellie, a former contractor for us, was subjected to the misogyny of the president.\n\nFinally, there is the constant pleas from Mr. Trump and his allies on the Hill for criminal investigations of those who have tried to raise the alarm about Russia. The low: Senators Charles Grassley and Lindsey Graham referring Mr. Steele to the Justice Department to investigate if he \u201clied\u201d to the F.B.I., a false allegation made to discredit a long-valued bureau source.\n\nOne of the most astonishing recent examples of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s character assassination involves Republican leaks to conservative news outlets of the closed-door testimony of James Baker, who was the F.B.I.\u2019s general counsel from 2014 to December 2017. If reports based on those leaks are to be believed, Mr. Baker testified that a former senior Justice Department attorney came to him weeks before the 2016 election with information regarding possible Russian efforts to collude with the Trump campaign.\n\nIn other words, a sworn officer of the court reported a possible crime in progress to another sworn officer of the court, knowing full well that to do so falsely is a crime.

He was 67.\n\nHis death was announced by his wife, Itsuko Aono. She did not specify the cause.\n\nMr. Ragin took his nickname from the gadget that gave him his trademark sound: the wah-wah pedal, a filter that altered the tone of his guitar to make notes and chords wriggle, moan or seem to say \u201cwah.\u201d\n\nWorking the pedal with prodigious and playful subtlety, he used it on many hit songs \u2014 for crunching syncopations and floating, curling chords in the Temptations\u2019 \u201cPapa Was a Rolling Stone\u201d; for slinky countermelodies in Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On\u201d; for chattering propulsion in Rose Royce\u2019s \u201cCar Wash\u201d; for little bluesy sighs and rhythmic nudges in Gloria Gaynor\u2019s \u201cI Will Survive\u201d; and for airborne, echoing interjections in Maxwell\u2019s \u201cAscension (Don\u2019t Ever Wonder).\u201d\n\nOne of his signature sounds was a luxuriant swoon, a combination of wah-wah, echo-delay, fast tremolo picking and a downward glissando that became synonymous with sensual R&B.

For decades, the Flyers were one of the few N.H.L. teams without a mascot. Team executives began to feel bereft during the 2016 and 2017 All-Star Games, where mascots like Iceburgh the penguin of the Pittsburgh Penguins and Youppi of the Montreal Canadiens, competed in their own game. They decided last year to fill the role.\n\nThis July, the team asked Brian Allen, a concept artist in Bellefonte, Pa., to send them sketches. He said the Flyers\u2019 art directors suggested a bulldog, a monster or \u201can amorphic creature\u201d like the Phillie Phanatic \u2014 the furry, green, long-snouted mascot who represents Philadelphia\u2019s baseball team.\n\n\u201cThey wanted it to look like the Phillie Phanatic and him could come from the same weird family or go to the same family reunion,\u201d Mr. Allen said. \u201cThey wanted it to be somebody you wanted to high-five, but not hug.\u201d\n\nSarah Schwab, the Flyers\u2019 director of marketing, said the team\u2019s senior leadership reviewed two final options. \u201cOne was kind of a safer option, and one more \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say unsafe \u2014 but one that kind of pushed the boundaries,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was Gritty.\u201d", "Judge Hovland has been sympathetic to the tribes\u2019 arguments in the past and in fact blocked the law\u2019s enforcement earlier this year, ruling that it unconstitutionally discriminated against Native Americans, who often don\u2019t use addresses on their reservations. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that injunction in late September, in a decision quickly upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nIn its ruling allowing the requirement to take effect, the appeals court wrote that opponents had not identified any instance in which a North Dakotan was actually disenfranchised as a result of the requirement. If a voter were so disenfranchised, it wrote, \u201cthe courthouse doors remain open.\u201d The latest lawsuit was essentially a response to that invitation.\n\nJudge Hovland, who was appointed by President George W.

He wrote on Thursday that the allegations gave him \u201cgreat cause for concern\u201d and would \u201crequire a detailed response from the secretary of state as this case proceeds.\u201d But he concluded that halting the law\u2019s enforcement now, with the election five days away and early voting in progress, would \u201ccreate as much confusion as it will alleviate.\u201d\n\nMark Gaber, senior legal counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, said he and the other lawyers were reviewing their options.

A black man and woman gunned down in a grocery store, allegedly by a white man who had, moments before, tried to storm a black church. A mass shooting at a synagogue. The past two weeks have been ones of heartbreak and fear for many Americans. Even for those not directly touched by the horror, it is hard to escape the feeling that something has gone very wrong.\n\nIn the face of such tragedy, a president is expected to serve as the consoler in chief, setting aside the petty elements of politics to comfort a scared and grieving nation. Historically, the role has been pretty straightforward, as the presidential historian Michael Beschloss noted this week: \u201cThey heal. They unite. They inspire. It\u2019s not exactly rocket science.\u201d\n\nBut with this president, observed Mr. Beschloss, things don\u2019t work that way: \u201cIt\u2019s not in Donald Trump\u2019s software to do this. He\u2019s a one-trick pony. His single political m.o. is to try to divide and conquer, to pit groups against one another and benefit from it politically.\u201d\n\nThe violence of late has driven home just how reluctant President Trump is to focus on matters beyond the purely political. He knows, or at least is told, what he is supposed to say or do in such situations. But he has a devil of a time staying on that message for more than a few hours \u2014 especially with a high-stakes election just days away.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers overrode Mr. Brownback\u2019s veto last year and reversed most of the tax policy.\n\nLast fall, a survey of Kansans found 70 percent of people dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with Mr. Brownback\u2019s performance. But Democrats have tried to capitalize on that before, with mixed results. In 2014, when Mr. Brownback was seeking a second term, the Democrat lost the governor\u2019s race despite leading in pre-election polls. In 2016, Democrats and moderate Republicans made some gains in the state Legislature.\n\nMr. Kobach, a Breitbart columnist and steadfast ally of Mr. Trump, has long made national headlines for crafting and defending local restrictions on undocumented immigrants and for making unsupported claims about rampant voter fraud. Mr. Kobach has stressed those issues on the campaign trail. But he has also tried to draw a distinction between himself and Mr. Brownback, saying the ex-governor erred by cutting taxes without first making large cuts to state government, as he would do. Mr. Kobach even suggested that Ms. Kelly was the more Brownback-like candidate.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not actually running against me, she\u2019s running against Sam Brownback,\u201d Mr. Kobach said in the Garden City debate. After listing off points where he disagreed with Mr. Brownback, he added: \u201cWould the real Sam Brownback please stand up?\u201d\n\nKansas Democrats, currently on the sidelines in Topeka and shut out of the congressional delegation, see this election as a rare opportunity to reclaim their footing. In addition to Ms. Kelly\u2019s race, party leaders think they can flip two House seats in the eastern part of the state. And in recent days, outraged Democrats have rallied around the issue of Dodge City\u2019s only Election Day polling place being moved outside town, which many see as a blatant attempt to suppress Hispanic votes. A federal judge on Thursday rejected a request to order that a second voting location be opened in Dodge City.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 enthusiasm aside, there are reasons for skepticism about their chances. Ms. Kelly\u2019s support for abortion rights and some forms of gun control could scare off swing voters. And Kansans wary of Mr. Kobach but not eager to vote for a Democrat have other options. Greg Orman, a businessman running for governor as an independent, has polled in the high single-digits in many polls and could tip a close race to the Republicans.\n\nThere is also the matter of Mr. Brownback, Ms. Kelly\u2019s favorite rhetorical target, not being in Kansas anymore.", "NASHVILLE \u2014 Standing onstage at the Ryman Auditorium last week between her Pistol Annies\u2019 bandmates Ashley Monroe and Miranda Lambert, Angaleena Presley set up the gleeful divorce tune \u201cGot My Name Changed Back\u201d by announcing, \u201cThis next song is not about anyone in this band.\u201d Lambert, who has endured more than a few tabloid headlines, quickly disagreed. \u201cShe\u2019s full of it,\u201d she said in stronger language.\n\nThat\u2019s the attitude that has endeared this country supergroup to its fans \u2014 the Annies seem like they\u2019re both letting it all hang out and inhabiting personas that are larger than life.

But there are two caveats: You need to make sure the device isn\u2019t software-locked to another carrier, and you need to make sure its hardware is optimized for your carrier.\n\nWhen you buy a phone directly from Verizon, AT&T or another carrier, it usually comes \u201ccarrier locked.\u201d That means that phone will only be usable on Verizon, AT&T or whatever carrier you bought it from unless you ask them to unlock it.\n\nIf you\u2019re buying a used phone, you want to make sure it isn\u2019t locked to a carrier other than your own. If you\u2019re on AT&T, you can\u2019t buy a phone that\u2019s locked to Verizon. You\u2019ll either want an AT&T-branded phone or a phone that\u2019s listed as \u201cunlocked\u201d by the seller.\n\nIn addition, \u201csome phones have a few different numeric models that work better on some carriers than others,\u201d Mr. Edwards said. \u201cFor full and optimal compatibility, you need to pay attention to the specifics.\u201d\n\nThat means you shouldn\u2019t just search for \u201ciPhone 7\u201d and buy the cheapest listing that pops up.

In other cases, you may run into \u201cinternational\u201d models, which can lack support for certain features (like Samsung Pay, in the case of the international version of the Galaxy S7).\n\nWhen you punch the IMEI into your carrier\u2019s website, it will tell you if a phone is generally compatible with their network, but it will not tell you if it is optimal for their network. If a certain model is compatible with Sprint\u2019s network but doesn\u2019t support all of its LTE bands, your carrier\u2019s IMEI checker will not tell you \u2014 and you may not get the best possible speeds.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t sure which model numbers are compatible with your network, check on the manufacturer\u2019s website, or Google around to find out which model your carrier sells; then, search for that on your marketplace of choice.", "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The federal judge who doomed former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\u2019s bid to return to power by convicting him on corruption charges last year, agreed on Thursday to take a cabinet post in the government of the country\u2019s new president, Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nThe decision by the judge, S\u00e9rgio Moro, to take the helm of the Justice Ministry was met with both outrage and jubilation, a reflection of how polarizing he has become.\n\nThe position is newly reconfigured to oversee efforts to fight organized crime and corruption. Mr. Moro, the most visible law enforcement figure in a sweeping corruption inquiry that began in 2014, has been hailed at home and abroad as a crusading disrupter of a political class many saw as descending into kleptocracy.\n\nYet some Brazilians also came to regard him as a political operator doing the bidding of conservative politicians, particularly as he oversaw the swift prosecution of Mr. da Silva on corruption and money laundering charges.", "When the Department of Veterans Affairs released the annual ratings of its hospitals this fall, the facility in Atlanta dropped to the bottom, while the one in West Haven, Conn., shot to the top.

But the spirit of inquiry survives, enough for me to keep tuning in.\n\nI always half expect that one night Trumpism will join the lineup of strange, negative-energy phenomena, to be debated right alongside curses and devil worship.

And these are often alongside the fees that they have already racked up. These include $60 to determine whether a person is too poor to afford a lawyer, $10 a day for each day that he or she is jailed pretrial because bail was unaffordable, and $600 if the prosecutor tests evidence at the state crime lab.\n\nA national research project collecting information from 14 states found families owe on average $13,600 in court-related fees and fines.

This enchanting illustrated collection of essays and lectures by the British author best known for his children\u2019s trilogy \u201cHis Dark Materials\u201d is animated by wit, erudition and a passionate interest in how stories are made. It closes with a call for a secular, egalitarian understanding of humanity and the universe, and asks how that might be expressed in children\u2019s literature. \u201cIf that sounds like a tall order for kids\u2019 books,\u201d our reviewer, Laura Miller, writes, \u201cthis is in fact the essence of Pullman\u2019s appeal: He takes children seriously.

In this Gothic stunner, set chiefly in contemporary Prague and based loosely on the 19th-century horror novel \u201cMelmoth the Wanderer,\u201d a cursed woman has roamed the earth throughout history, bearing witness to human suffering. \u201cIt is a scary novel that chills to the bone even as it points the way to a warmer, more humane, place,\u201d Danielle Trussoni writes in a roundup of recent horror books. \u201cTerror is not the point, nor is menace, exactly, although the novel offers both. The real horror of this novel is not the ghostly Melmoth at all, but the cruelty we human beings enact upon one another.\u201d\n\nSONS OF CAIN: A History of Serial Killers From the Stone Age to the Present, by Peter Vronsky.

A lineup of fabled murderers, with special emphasis on the \u201cgolden age\u201d of serial killers in America (1950-2000), draws a link between the trained killers of wartime and the generations that follow them. \u201cVronsky has an alarming theory about the \u2018enormous glut\u2019 of American serial murderers who came of age during World War II and the postwar baby boom,\u201d Marilyn Stasio writes, reviewing the book alongside other recent true-crime titles. \u201cHe observes that the offenders who made their first kill during the peak years \u2026 \u2018all lived in the wake of a receding shock wave of humanity\u2019s biggest, most viciously primitive and most lethal war.\u2019\u201d\n\nIN THE NAME OF THE CHILDREN: An F.B.I.

Hunt evokes countless stories embedded in the American consciousness \u2014 and then makes them even more terrifying. \u201cIt is tempting to seek a moral in the end. \u2026 But Hunt isn\u2019t that predictable or didactic,\u201d Eowyn Ivey writes in her review. \u201cThis is a perfect book to read when you\u2019re safely tucked in your home, your back to the wall, while outside your door the wind rips the leaves from the trees and the woods grow dark.\u201d", "The Russian space agency announced on Thursday that it was planning to launch three astronauts to the International Space Station on Dec. 3., signaling that it believes the country\u2019s Soyuz spacecraft is safe for travel after an in-flight failure last month.\n\nThe Soyuz is the only way for people to get to the space station. In October, two astronauts made a harrowing but safe emergency return after the Soyuz they were riding in suddenly lost control. Thursday\u2019s announcement also heads off a situation that could have left the space station with no crew aboard as early as January.\n\n[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]\n\nRoscosmos, the Russian agency, said an investigation has figured out what went wrong during the October failure. A bent pin, part of the system that senses when the four side boosters fall away from the Soyuz\u2019s central core, prevented one of the side boosters from falling away cleanly. The nose of the side booster then hit the central core.\n\n\u201cIt resulted in its decompression and, as consequence, the space rocket lost its attitude control,\u201d the investigation committee reported.", "Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.\n\n__________\n\nNancy Dubuc, the newly installed chief executive of Vice Media, announced the company would be profitable by \u201cthe next fiscal year\u201d \u2014 an important milestone for a business that was most recently valued at $5.7 billion.\n\n\u201cIt actually was profitable a couple years ago, and then with all the expansion and investment, we made it not profitable,\u201d Ms. Dubuc said at DealBook\u2019s Playing for the Long Term conference on Thursday. \u201cBut very, very quickly it\u2019ll be profitable again.\u201d\n\n(Check out the latest from the DealBook conference.)\n\nCost-cutting will help.

End birthright citizenship. Fear the caravan. Send active-duty troops to the border. Refuse asylum.\n\nImmigration has been the animating issue of the Trump presidency, and now \u2014 with the possibility that Republicans could face significant losses in the midterm elections on Tuesday \u2014 the president has fully embraced a dark, anti-immigrant message in the hope that stoking fear will motivate voters to reject Democrats.\n\nIn a rambling speech on Thursday afternoon that was riddled with falsehoods and vague promises to confront a \u201ccrisis\u201d at the border, Mr. Trump used the official backdrop of the White House to step up his efforts to demonize a caravan of Central Americans that has been making its way through Mexico, assail Democrats, and promote a vision of a United States that would be better off with fewer immigrants.\n\nThe president said he had ordered troops to respond to any migrants in the caravan who throw rocks as if they were brandishing firearms, saying, \u201cI told them: Consider it a rifle.\u201d He said his government had already begun to construct \u201cmassive cities of tents\u201d to imprison legal and illegal immigrants who try to enter the United States.", "In Boot\u2019s initial telling of his story, conservatism is inspiring, principled, responsible, morally demanding, wise. It collapses only when Donald Trump assaults the citadel from the outside, like a rampaging army or deadly contagion. The heroes of this narrative are Boot and his allies, who take a noble if futile stand against this evil invader in the name of their conservative ideals.\n\nBut the story Boot recounts in the concluding chapters is different. Now, in light of the present, Boot sees rot on the right that has been there from the start \u2014 in William F. Buckley\u2019s pro-segregationist editorials in National Review, in Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s best-selling screed \u201cA Choice Not an Echo,\u201d in Newt Gingrich\u2019s take-no-prisoners tenure as speaker of the House, in rabble-rousing talk radio shock jocks and above all in the polarizing and poisonous influence of Fox News. All of this leads Boot to conclude that \u201cextremism is embedded in the DNA of the modern conservative movement,\u201d as if Trump is where the movement had been headed, or fated to end up, from the start.\n\nThis implies that it\u2019s mostly Boot, and not conservatism or the Republican Party, that has changed. Scales have fallen from his eyes. Once he was blind, but now he sees. He even adopts the quasi-religious language of the social justice left in describing an intellectual awakening about the persistence of racism and sexism in American society.\n\nBut then what are we to make of Boot\u2019s epilogue, where he lists the policies he now supports and ends up saying pretty much the same thing he always has? He\u2019s fiscally conservative and socially liberal, favors free markets, free trade and high rates of immigration, and internationalism in foreign policy backed up by the threat (and generous use) of military force around the globe. These were exactly Boot\u2019s views in 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2015.\n\nThe one thing that clearly has changed is that Boot now regards the Iraq war, which he giddily championed in explicitly imperialistic terms, as a mistake \u2014 one that has taught him the \u201climits of American power.\u201d That\u2019s refreshing, though it would have been nice to see more evidence that this lesson is being translated into greater restraint about America\u2019s conduct in the world generally. Instead, we get reflexively hawkish comments about America\u2019s Obama-era and present-day dealings with Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, North Korea, China and Russia. Many of these statements follow from the same misguided assumptions that convinced Boot and so many others that a war of choice to oust Saddam Hussein was a splendid idea.\n\nOne wonders how the book would have turned out had Boot taken a few more steps back from the fray, to place his lifelong ideological commitments in a wider frame. In that case, he might have seen that the principles and assumptions that first drew him to the Republican Party were not especially \u201cconservative\u201d at all. They were, instead, the expression of a particularly bellicose strand of Cold War liberalism that migrated from the center-left to the center-right in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, when a shellshocked Democratic Party temporarily abandoned it. By the election of Bill Clinton in 1992, this brand of muscular, centrist liberalism was back, dominating (with minor differences in emphasis) both parties.", "To the Editor:\n\nRe \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t Get Too Excited,\u2019\u201d by Elisabeth Rosenthal and Shefali Luthra (Sunday Review, Oct. 21):\n\nAlthough almost every major country in the world has medical care that is significantly less expensive than ours and most have medical outcomes that are as good or better than ours , your article is correct in pointing out that very few of these countries have what amounts to \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d\n\nThe most common systems involve taxpayer-funded, nonprofit insurance, provided by private companies that are regulated by the government. The insurance companies earn operating costs and salaries for their employees but not large profits. There is no benefit to denying coverage for pre-existing medical conditions or conditions that require frequent or extensive medical care. Prices for medical care, medical devices and drugs are usually determined by negotiation and are uniform throughout a country.\n\nBy contrast, we have unregulated for-profit medical insurance with a middleman whose \u201cproduct\u201d we must buy, a product that adds nothing to medical care except unnecessary hassle and enormously increased cost. Medicare for all addresses this problem by eliminating the middleman.\n\nSamuel L.

This movie has a mountain of them. But that doesn\u2019t make this 1977 Steven Spielberg classic a Thanksgiving movie. And it\u2019s not quite a family film in the traditional sense, either \u2014 not when the hero walks away from his wife and kids to go on a galactic joy ride. What \u201cClose Encounters\u201d is, is a paean to optimism \u2014 to the idea that world governments and the international scientific community could come together to plan a friendly welcome for some unexpected extraterrestrial visitors.

After the Parkland shooting, gun safety activists launched boycotts against companies deemed sympathetic to the firearms industry; Delta, MetLife and several other businesses dropped deals with the National Rifle Association.\n\nGun rights supporters quickly responded with their own boycott campaigns. Some companies remain reluctant to make changes in strategy in reaction to shootings. Earlier this week, FedEx backed out of a marketing arrangement with the N.R.A., but stressed the decision was unrelated to a gunman\u2019s recent rampage at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.\n\nAfter the shooting in Parkland, BlackRock canvassed its clients across the country and eventually said it would help invest in funds without links to the firearms industry.\n\nThe company also asked gun manufacturers for more information about their business practices.

Execution \u201cby the one-eyed Cyclops,\u201d he called it. In almost every surviving photograph, he looks fugitive and uneasy, \u201cas if his clothes are borrowed,\u201d Sue Prideaux writes in an exemplary new biography, \u201cI Am Dynamite!\u201d \u201cThe elbows and knees are not in the right places and the jackets strain at the buttons.\u201d\n\nA man stuffed into the wrong clothes. This is how Nietzsche has come to us through history, for decades notoriously misappropriated by Nazis and nationalists. Under the watch of his sister, Elisabeth, handmaiden to Hitler, this philosopher who deplored German nationalism (\u201cDeutschland, Deutschland \u00fcber alles, that is the end of German philosophy\u201d) and anti-Semitism (\u201cI will have all anti-Semites shot\u201d) was refashioned into an intellectual architect of the Third Reich. The Nazis distributed copies of \u201cThus Spake Zarathustra\u201d to troops in the field.\n\nFifty years of scholarship has done much to rehabilitate Nietzsche\u2019s reputation and to reveal the extent of Elisabeth\u2019s meddling. She assumed care of him in his final years, when fame had found him but he was long gone to madness. With the tacit approval of Heidegger, she strung together uncollected notes into poisonous little tracts, piecing together a Nietzsche to serve as a Nazi mouthpiece. His ideas of the \u00dcbermensch and will to power were stripped of their provocation and clowning and rendered as crudely authoritarian. The \u201chard maxims\u201d he proposed to the individual \u2014 to be courageous, to seek out the enemy and relish war \u2014 were made bluntly literal and adopted by nations, bizarrely, given that the only thing Nietzsche loathed more than war between nations (to him a form of madness) was the idea of the nation itself. He relinquished Prussian citizenship early in his career and remained proudly stateless.\n\nIn this biography, Nietzsche steps out of the mists of obfuscation and rumor, vividly evoked with his beautiful manners and ridiculous mustache, the blue-lensed glasses to protect his delicate eyes. Prideaux relies on the mapmaker\u2019s method of triangulation, using time not place as the fixed point and drawing her subject into focus by examining the events in his life, his personal writing and his published work. \u201cThis falls into the biographical fallacy, I know,\u201d she has said in interviews, \u201cbut my justification is a passage from \u2018Beyond Good and Evil\u2019 where Nietzsche says that every great philosophy is a form of involuntary and unperceived memoir. In other words, all philosophy is, to an extent, autobiography. One illuminates the other.\u201d", "The Pittsburgh project was the first time the Tablet had dispatched a team for a breaking news event.

When Iran fired missiles into Syria days later, in what it said was retaliation for the massacre, it identified the target as an Islamic State base.\n\nAn Arab separatist group, the Ahvaz National Resistance, took responsibility for Ahvaz attack, but Mr. Jabor\u2019s group insisted that it was not involved. The two organizations have links, but the relationship between them is murky.\n\nThe Danish and Swedish police said that a Norwegian man of Iranian decent was arrested on Oct. 21 in Sweden and remains in solitary confinement, but has denied all charges.\n\nIn late September, the authorities noticed the man taking photographs of Mr. Jabor\u2019s residence and \u201cintended to pass on the information to an Iranian intelligence service with a view to the information forming part of the plans to assassinate the leader\u201d the security service said.\n\nA year ago another member of Mr. Jabor\u2019s separatist group was gunned down outside his home in Amsterdam, and last month Belgium charged an Iranian diplomat over alleged plans to bomb a meeting of Iranian exiles.", "What would you like to see here?

Its artists\u2019 examination, and occasional embrace, of wild skepticism appears prescient now that the most violent acts \u2014 the murder of students in Parkland, Fla., the mailing of pipe bombs to former presidents \u2014 are dismissed as \u201cfalse flags\u201d even on a leading cable news channel.

If voters in all three states approve, an estimated 340,000 additional low-income adults would be eligible for free health coverage through the government program, as the health law allows, starting next year.\n\nBut the ballot questions also cover a wide range of other issues: whether to ease penalties for low-level drug offenders in Ohio; consider a ban on vaping in indoor work spaces in Florida; and whether to remove abortion protections from state constitutions in Alabama and West Virginia.\n\nMedicaid Expansion\n\nIn addition to the ballot questions in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah, the outcome of tight governor\u2019s races in seven states that have so far resisted expanding Medicaid could change the equation there.", "Our feast is festive, but maybe not so grand. We imagine, with a crowd, that stemware might not be an option. If not, glass tumblers are fine for these wines. If you must use plastic, beware the flimsy pretend stemware. The benefits are negligible and not worth the risk of spills. Opt for tumblers instead.\n\nWe emphasize that choosing wines for Thanksgiving is not an exercise in pairing. The meal \u2014 especially the sort of potluck buffet where guests bring all sorts of family favorites \u2014 is too complex and disparate to worry about precision matching.\n\nInstead, we suggest picking versatile wines that go with many different sorts of flavors. And we are wary of wines that are more than 14 percent alcohol.\n\nSome people argue that the alcohol level is meaningless, as long as the wine is balanced. I don\u2019t buy that in general. But Thanksgiving in particular is a long, fatiguing journey, literally and figuratively: Many people travel over hills, dales and interstates to feast on the myriad filling dishes that cover the table. Don\u2019t add to the languor with heavy, alcoholic wines.\n\nWe prefer wines that are nimble and energetic, that refresh the palate rather than enervate. Usually, these are wines with lively acidity, which snaps the mouth to attention and merges well with many flavors. While acidity is a friend, pronounced tannins, oakiness and unbalanced sweetness are not. Avoid them if possible.\n\nAt Thanksgiving, no host would risk running out of food. The principle of Thanksgiving is plenty. The same is true of wine. Figure at minimum about one bottle per drinking guest. As with food, you will have leftovers. Give extra bottles as take-home gifts or keep them for yourself.

Welles takes on a lot in \u201cThe Other Side\u201d \u2014 men, women, the decline of Hollywood, the persistence of vision, and the charms, torments and betrayals of close male friendships. \u201cFor years, I personally didn\u2019t want this document shown,\u201d Bogdanovich continues, as a lonely horn wails, \u201cfrankly, I didn\u2019t like the way I came off in the piece.

A handful of others did, including Bogdanovich and the producers Frank Marshall and Filip Jan Rymsza, who relied on memories, script notes and a postproduction team that included the editor Bob Murawski to put Welles\u2019s presumed intentions into commercially acceptable shape. It\u2019s an admirable undertaking, though what relation it bears to the project that Welles carried around in his head \u2014 and that he shot and edited for years, massaging it like sculptor\u2019s clay \u2014 is a question that only a s\u00e9ance could answer.\n\nWhat we have is something of a seductive tease, a haunted film that at times entrances and delights and at times offends and embarrasses.

Mr. DeSantis\u2019s campaign has countered that resorting to accusations of racism is a way for Mr. Gillum to avoid scrutiny on his lobbyist dealings.\n\nThe Democratic emphasis on racial politics could push more white voters, who make up a majority of Florida\u2019s electorate and came out in droves for Mr. Trump in 2016, to the polls for Mr. DeSantis this year.

Any ideas for making this better?", "Ms. Abrams and her team, including her deputy campaign manager, Ms. Byrd, have spent a majority of campaign funds on canvassing and get-out-the-vote efforts. A heavy field strategy may seem counterintuitive in this digital era, but the chance to look someone in the eyes and connect might just be the thing to slice through \u201cfake news\u201d that exposes voters to so many conflicting messages that they often don\u2019t know what to believe.\n\nAnd it\u2019s working. The New Georgia Project, which Ms. Abrams started in 2014, has registered more than 200,000 voters, many of them young or of color or both. In response, the Republican candidate for governor, Brian Kemp, has unleashed a wave of voter suppression, tossing 53,000 registered voters off the rolls, 70 percent of whom are black.\n\nJessica Byrd began her electoral consulting firm Three Points Strategies after Michael Brown Jr. was killed in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014. She had two goals. The first was to bridge electoral work with activism, which has led to the creation of the Electoral Justice Project within the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of groups across the country. Her second goal, she said, was to \u201cspecifically focus on electing really unapologetic, hyperprogressive black women.\u201d\n\nHer goal as a millennial and a member of the Black Lives Matter generation, which is skeptical of liberal politics, is to get close enough to the operations of political power to transform electoral politics. Given increasing evidence of rampant voter suppression nationwide, some radical kind of transformation is urgent and necessary. Expanding the voter rolls won\u2019t help if in the end, voters are still disenfranchised.\n\nMs. Byrd says the two-party system is \u201cthe greatest barrier to black political participation of all other systemic barriers,\u201d even though she manages and strategizes for campaigns of black female Democrats, including, in 2017, several mayoral campaigns.

The American government used the power of the dollar and its influence over obscure organizations such as the Swift financial messaging service to monitor what its adversaries and terrorists were doing and, in some cases, to cut entire states, such as North Korea, out of world financial flows. These policies effectively pressed foreign banks into service as agents of American influence and helped bring states like Iran to the negotiating table.\n\nOn Nov. 4, the United States is set to escalate sanctions against Iran as part of its decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. These sanctions include financial messaging, so the Trump administration could press for Swift, a private cooperative based in Brussels, to disconnect Iranian banks from its network. Swift is like a global post office for banks, providing a secure messaging system for the vast majority of international transactions, so disconnecting Iran would isolate it almost completely from the global financial system and would have drastic and immediate consequences for the Iranian economy.\n\nIf the Trump administration goes ahead with this plan, it will have serious consequences for the United States as well. It will undermine America\u2019s influence over the international financial architecture and diminish its power over allies and adversaries alike.", "PITTSBURGH \u2014 Robert Bowers, the man accused of murdering 11 people in a hate-fueled massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue, entered a plea of not guilty in a federal courtroom on Thursday.\n\nMr. Bowers, 46, walked into the courtroom on foot, showing little sign of the injuries he sustained from the shootout that ended the attack on Saturday, besides a heavily bandaged left elbow.

He sat down with little effort.\n\nThe arraignment, which took less than 15 minutes, began with prosecutors reading him a summary of the 44 counts in his indictment, which was handed down Wednesday.

For the rats, the exposures started before birth and continued until they were about 2 years old.\n\nSome 2 to 3 percent of the male rats exposed to the radiation developed malignant gliomas, a deadly brain cancer, compared to none in a control group that received no radiation. Many epidemiologists see no overall rise in the incidence of gliomas in the human population.\n\nThe study also found that about 5 to 7 percent of the male rats exposed to the highest level of radiation developed certain heart tumors, called malignant schwannomas, compared to none in the control group. Malignant schwannomas are similar to acoustic neuromas, benign tumors that can develop in people, in the nerve that connects the ear to the brain.\n\nThe rats were exposed to radiation at a frequency of 900 megahertz \u2014 typical of the second generation of cellphones that prevailed in the 1990s, when the study was first conceived.\n\nCurrent cellphones represent a fourth generation, known as 4G, and 5G phones are expected to debut around 2020.

The bank was not expecting a leader of its Asian investment bank to be implicated as well. Goldman on Thursday suspended Mr. Vella, according to a person with direct knowledge but was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nGoldman has repeatedly played down its role in the 1MDB scandal, saying it was unaware of how money from the fund was being used.

But mostly it serves as a warm-up for \u201cThe Other Side of the Wind,\u201d which Welles started shooting in 1970 but is just now being released \u2014 33 years after his death.\n\n\u201cThe Other Side of the Wind\u201d has often served either to burnish Welles\u2019s legendary status or to further establish what dreary minds like to call his unfulfilled promise. By the time he began production on it, he had long ago written himself into history, having triumphed in theater, radio and film. His movie output was relatively modest compared with some of his peers, including those who worked in a Hollywood system and culture that remained hostile to him to the end.

He\u2019s also been instrumental in the release of \u201cThe Other Side of the Wind.\u201d His prominence here is understandable, although it complicates a movie that can seem less interested in Welles as an artist than in ideas about him (genius, failure, father, god, monster) that formed in the minds of others, among them some who worked on \u201cThe Other Side.\u201d", "Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z create social media excitement no matter what they do, but their Halloween costumes this year seemed to create even more hullabaloo than usual.

Walt Drenth, her college coach, who is now at Michigan State, is guiding her once more.\n\nTo get ready for New York, she has trained about 120 miles per week, the same as at Hansons-Brooks.

The Swedish playwright, theater director and filmmaker, who died in 2007, remains one of the most praised and, to a certain extent, most misunderstood 20th-century artists. The praise stems from his cinematic mastery and treatment of profound themes; the misunderstanding, from the conventional wisdom that because Bergman treated profound themes, his work must be a slog.\n\nBut Bergman was a gripping storyteller. You could even call him an entertainer. The German director Margarethe Von Trotta makes that clear in the opening of her new documentary, \u201cSearching for Ingmar Bergman,\u201d in which she breaks down the opening scene of Bergman\u2019s 1957 classic \u201cThe Seventh Seal.\u201d This picture, she says, both engrossed her as a viewer and made her want to be a filmmaker.

And although it\u2019s loaded with sex, the most brazen thing about \u201cMarfa Girl 2\u201d might be that it presupposes some knowledge of \u201cMarfa Girl,\u201d which played the Rome Film Festival in 2012, received limited theatrical distribution in 2015 and made little impact with critics or audiences. Even stranger: Clark actually includes scenes from the earlier film in this one, though they only add minimal context.\n\nLike the previous movie, \u201cMarfa Girl 2\u201d follows the lives of some young, down-and-out characters in the dusty town of Marfa, Texas. Chief among them is the skater Adam (Adam Mediano), who has two children from two different women, and Marfa Girl (Drake Burnette), who herself is now saddled with an infant, the result of a brutal rape that occurred in the earlier movie.", "With visuals as kinetic as its language, Joseph Kahn\u2019s \u201cBodied\u201d is an outrageously smart, shockingly funny satire of P.C. culture whose words gush so quickly you\u2019ll want to see it twice.\n\nSet in the world of battle rap where combatants square off to exchange what amounts to exquisitely tuned insult poetry, the story (by Alex Larsen, a.k.a. Kid Twist, a 10-year veteran of the battle rap scene) follows Adam (Calum Worthy), a gawky grad student and a paperwhite audience surrogate. Researching rap\u2019s use of the N-word, Adam is entranced by the vim and creativity of the performers and their utter lack of linguistic inhibition. But when he discovers his own talent for the form, his enthusiasm and na\u00efvet\u00e9 threaten not just his relationship with his uptight girlfriend and culturally sensitive cohort, but his academic future to boot.", "Into this low boiling chaos walks Jess (Sonya Harum), John\u2019s pregnant teenage daughter from a previous relationship, who seems to have a complicated history with the Ryries but is invited to stay with them during her pregnancy. Early on, Jess befriends Gordie (Mike Faist), a young man who is also dealing with loss; his home is still filled with piles of his recently deceased father\u2019s stuff, including a series of handmade dioramas built out of assorted junk.\n\nThose eclectic dioramas serve as a playful aesthetic reference point for Wang\u2019s film, which mixes styles and modes. Though we are watching what often appear to be unnervingly even-keeled characters, sometimes we\u2019ll glimpse a painful flashback, or hear a person\u2019s true thoughts. In one marvelous instance, the family gathers in their kitchen, and then, as they leave the room, a part of the frame opens up to reveal the scene\u2019s touching conclusion elsewhere.\n\nAs with the director\u2019s other works, there\u2019s a self-conscious, constructed quality to \u201cThe Grief of Others,\u201d but it rarely veers into the precious or the phony. It\u2019s an artful portrait of a world that refuses the order we try to impose on it when we close ourselves off to heartache, doubt and pain.", "Even an extraordinary person doesn\u2019t necessarily make for a dynamic movie subject. That appears to the case with Kailash Satyarthi, an activist in India who was one of two Nobel Peace Prize winners in 2014 and has devoted his career to rescuing children working as factory slaves. He is the focus of \u201cThe Price of Free,\u201d a routine awareness documentary.\n\nIt is difficult to argue with the premises that child labor is wrong; that everyone deserves an education; and that persons who risk their lives to rescue trafficked children \u2014 as we see Satyarthi and others in his organization, Bachpan Bachao Andolan, doing in the film \u2014 are selfless and worthy of the world\u2019s attention. But because of this, watching \u201cThe Price of Free\u201d is largely a process of nodding in agreement.\n\nThe director, Derek Doneen, adds a bit of striking animation for flashbacks, and there are a few strands that generate tension. A village head arrives at Satyarthi\u2019s ashram to retrieve rescued children, ostensibly to return them to their homes; Satyarthi is duly skeptical. And the film focuses with particular intensity \u2014 with the help of clandestinely shot footage \u2014 on the search for one boy named Sonu.\n\nMostly, however, \u201cThe Price of Free\u201d is interested in spreading the word about Satyarthi\u2019s work, both in India and globally, and in getting consumers to approach what they buy with a critical eye, so as not to support child labor. That\u2019s an important message, and it\u2019s not essential to watch the movie to receive it.", "Good Thursday. (Want this by email?

I was born two years later, in 1952, and lived in the same neighborhoods he lived in. Ara Guler\u2019s Istanbul is my Istanbul.\n\nI first heard of Ara in the 1960s when I saw his photographs in Hayat, a widely read weekly news and gossip magazine with a strong emphasis on photography.

Much of what already exists is at or above market rate, with some buildings offering additional amenities to residents.\n\nThe city\u2019s pilot, called ShareNYC, will seek proposals for private development sites that favor mostly income-restricted units, including those for very low-income renters. The units will vary in design, but will likely run between 150 and 400 square feet per bedroom, may or may not have private bathrooms, and will include a common kitchen and living space that is shared with other roommates, according to a briefing on the program and an agency official. A mix of conventional and market-rate units will also be considered.\n\nThe deadline for submissions is March 14, 2019.\n\nVersions of this kind of housing have already sprung up around the city, but restrictions on the maximum number of unrelated roommates (up to three), and constraints on most ground-up construction in this category, sometimes called \u201csingle-room occupancy,\u201d or S.R.O., have limited what developers can build.", "Even as Republicans grow hopeful about at least keeping the Senate during the midterm elections, one part of America looks sure to be brutal for their party: the Rust Belt.

The prospect of another pendulum swing back to blue illuminates what Mr. Trump\u2019s election in 2016 really meant.\n\nRust Belt voters in the last election and in this one were and are declaring a deep dissatisfaction that persists even in good economic times, because it is grounded in something cultural and deeply local: the collapse of community.\n\nDemocrats are polling way ahead in this year\u2019s governor\u2019s races in Pennsylvania and Michigan, and they have very good chances of taking over the governor\u2019s mansions in Ohio and Wisconsin. These, famously, were the four Rust Belt states Mr. Trump swung from Democrat in 2012 to Republican in 2016 and that carried him to the White House.\n\nThe picture is similar in Rust Belt Senate races: Democrats will easily win Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan, and they will probably win Wisconsin.", "When reporters asked President Trump last week if he bore any responsibility for the pipe bombs sent to many of his critics and adversaries, he declared his innocence:\n\n\u201cNot at all, no. There is no blame. There is no anything.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, an Oct. 29 PRRI survey revealed that 69 percent of voters believe that Trump has \u201cdamaged the dignity of the presidency.\u201d\n\nTrump reinforced this public assessment in his answer to another question: Did he plan to phone any of the officials who had been targeted with bombs, including his predecessors in the White House, the Clintons and the Obamas? His reply:\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll probably pass, thank you very much.\u201d\n\nThese exchanges raise the same two questions that have been posed repeatedly during the Trump presidency:\n\nHow could this man have been elected to the highest office in the land?

He was responding to a question about federal criminal charges filed hours earlier against two former Goldman investment bankers over their role in helping to finance a Malaysian government fund from which about $4 billion went missing. \u201cBut here in this case, at the very least, and this part I know, one of our people lied to us and evaded our systems and our controls.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d he added.\n\nOn Oct. 1, the longtime investment-banking chief David M.

Beyond joking about the idea of unfettered tweeting, he has said little so far about his future plans.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, looking relaxed in a navy suit and blue tie, he reminisced about his more than twelve years running Goldman and addressed some of the c-suite mysteries that had enveloped his tenure. As to whether longtime firm president Gary D.

In particular, he spoke about the newspaper business under News Corp, a roster that includes The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post, as well as The Times and The Sun in Britain.\n\nThe sale of Fox\u2019s film and TV studios to Disney prompted a question about whether his father would ever sell The Wall Street Journal, which Mr. Murdoch acquired in 2007 for over $5 billion.\n\n\u201cI never thought we\u2019d sell the TV studio, the film studio, so who knows?\u201d Lachlan responded. In the next breath, he said of his father, \u201cHe loves journalism. He loves The Wall Street Journal and what it represents.\u201d\n\nThe businesses that will remain under the control of the Murdochs after the close of the Disney deal early next year will center on news and sports. That means Lachlan will run Fox News, the Fox Broadcasting network and the FS1 cable sports network.\n\nFox News, in particular, has come under heavy criticism for its close ties to the Trump administration. That has led to charges from critics that Fox News, and the larger Murdoch TV business, is actually a red state media organization.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLachlan disagreed. \u201cI think about it as an all-state media organization,\u201d he said, later adding that, \u201cwe program to everyone.

The women discussed how the #MeToo movement continued to revolutionize gender dynamics across the workplace, culture, in social circles and in sports and education. Both have become vocal leaders.\n\nMs. Lakshmi, the host and an executive producer of \u201cTop Chef\u201d as well as a model, wrote an op-ed in The New York Times in September revealing that she was raped at the age of 16 and empathizing with women who waited years to disclose sexual assault.\n\nThe op-ed was published as two women came forward to detail accusations against Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and President Trump questioned why one of the women, Christine Blasey Ford, didn\u2019t report the incident when it happened more than 30 years ago.\n\nMs. Borders, formerly the president of the W.N.B.A., was named chief executive of Time\u2019s Up, a legal advocacy group for women in the workplace, last month, and her first day on the job was Thursday. The organization aims to tackle workplace discrimination around the world.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe conversation was wide-ranging as Ms. Borders and Ms. Lakshmi described the need for a cultural shift, not just in the workplace, but particularly in how men are socialized and boys are raised.\n\n\u201cWe need to stop equating aggression and masculinity because I think that\u2019s a big part of it,\u201d Ms. Lakshmi said.\n\nMs. Borders said there needed to be more transparency, particularly on the issue of salaries, so women would know if they were being underpaid. She said that companies should understand that policies and practices that empower women also help organizations as a whole.\n\n\u201cWe add value,\u201d Ms. Borders said.\n\nBoth women said the ability to share stories through social media had helped strengthen the #MeToo movement and create a time of real social change. Ms. Borders said there was a recognition among what she called survivors of sexual abuse that their stories were not \u201cour burden to bear but society\u2019s burden to bear.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it lit fire,\u201d she said.\n\nPhoto\n\nSnap Chief: Broadcasting Regulations Offer a Lesson in Social Media Age\n\nEvan Spiegel, the chief executive of Snap, the maker of the disappearing-message app Snapchat, said broadcasting regulations offer a framework for how to think about the dangers of social media.\n\n\u201cIf you look historically at America, a place that\u2019s always celebrated things like free speech, we\u2019ve actually always thought about broadcasting really differently than how we thought about communication,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Americans have long accepted most forms of speech, even the distasteful kind, they have been less tolerant when that speech is widely distributed, he said, noting that broadcasters are subject to regulations on what they can and can\u2019t say or show.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Where do we draw the line in terms of where broadcasting is versus communication with friends?\u201d\n\nSome have argued that social media has enabled social change, but Mr. Spiegel said that view is overly simplistic.\n\n\u201cOne of the more dangerous things that I\u2019ve seen is this idea that just using your voice is going to make a big difference,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a piece of it, that\u2019s half of it, but the other half is really taking action to implement that change.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Niraj Chokshi\n\nPhoto\n\nMerck\u2019s Ken Frazier explains why C.E.O.s need principles\n\nTo address corporate America\u2019s diversity problem, Ken Frazier sees a lesson in his own past.\n\nThe chief executive of Merck is one of only three black chief executives in the Fortune 500. But growing up as the son of a janitor in inner-city Philadelphia, Mr. Frazier faced an opportunity gap. Fortunately for him, a desegregation policy and a 90-minute daily bus ride that gave him time to read helped to overcome it.\n\n\u201cI look back at my own life and I realize that I was treated in an extraordinary way in this country,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the nation increasingly self-segregates, Mr. Frazier said, the workplace is one of the few remaining places that offers that same opportunity for people of different backgrounds to interact \u2014 and business leaders, he says, have a responsibility to uphold that basic American value.\n\nThat conviction led Mr. Frazier to step down last year from President Trump\u2019s manufacturing advisory council, the first of many executives to do so after the president equivocated in his response to white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFor me, it was a very clear personal decision as a matter of conscience,\u201d Mr. Frazier said. \u201cI happen to believe that political discourse, political speech, has consequences.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Niraj Chokshi\n\nPhoto\n\nMary Barra says G.M. is \u2018on track\u2019 to roll out autonomous vehicles next year\n\nMary T.

If Republicans suffer humiliating defeats in the midterm elections, they suggest, President Trump will get the blame. Influential donors and grass-roots Republicans will turn on him, and the party will get back to normal. Not so long ago this was the party of Paul Ryan and free trade. This was the party of George W. Bush and compassionate conservatism. This was a party whose self-performed autopsy after the 2012 election called for more minority outreach. After Mr. Trump, why can\u2019t the Republicans be that party again?\n\nThe ranks of anti-Trump Republicans grow thinner by the day. They\u2019re retiring from Congress. They\u2019re writing memoirs blasting their former friends. But they hold out hope for the future. If the Republican Party could undergo such a profound change in personality and policy thanks to just one man in a mere three years, who\u2019s to say it can\u2019t change back? The Trump coalition seems so impermanent, after all, a motley mix of Southern evangelicals, businessmen who think like the Chamber of Commerce and disaffected white voters from the Rust Belt. Throw in foreign-policy hawks and anti-interventionist America Firsters, and Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican Party looks like an impossible contradiction. It can\u2019t last. Can it?\n\nYes, it can. In fact, the party that President Trump has remade in his image is arguably less divided and in a better position to keep winning the White House than it has been at any time since the 1980s. What Mr. Trump has done is to rediscover the formula that made the landslide Republican Electoral College victories of the Nixon and Reagan years possible. Mr. Trump\u2019s signature themes of economic nationalism and immigration restriction are only 21st-century updates to the issues that brought the Republican Party triumph in all but one of the six presidential elections between 1968 and 1988.\n\nSome of the parallels are obvious. President Trump talks about crime and left-wing agitation in much the same way that Richard Nixon once did \u2014 and Ronald Reagan, too, especially during his time as governor of California. Mr. Trump\u2019s combination of force with an aversion to large-scale military interventions and nation-building also bears a resemblance to the policies of Republican presidents past. Dwight Eisenhower and Mr. Reagan also preferred to build up military strength without engaging in the kinds of prolonged wars for which Lyndon Johnson and George W. Bush are remembered. And while Mr. Nixon was mired in Vietnam, he ran as a candidate eager to find an exit.", "People who still qualify for subsidies but earn a bit more have other factors to consider. Some may see their subsidies shrink a bit this year \u2014 that\u2019s because prices on silver plans, which are used to calculate subsidies, have declined slightly. In some places, those subsidies may still be large enough to offset most of the monthly premium costs of, say, a bronze plan or to make a gold plan more reasonable.\n\nIf you\u2019re not eligible for a subsidy, it could be worthwhile to consider plans that comply with the law but are offered off the exchange directly through an insurer or a broker. Given the inflated prices of certain silver plans, buying the same metal plan outside the exchange could save you roughly 10 percent on average, according to Cynthia Cox, a health insurance policy expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nA 40-year-old single person would pay about $480 a month on average for a full- price, benchmark silver plan on the state and federal exchanges, Ms. Cox said.

I started thinking, \u2018Is this really worth it for me?\u2019\u201d", "Some argue that no German chancellor could have held on to the office while behaving much differently in the realm of economic policy. Given a deep cultural proclivity toward thrift, moral revulsion over debt and a fear of rising prices dating to the hyperinflation after World War I, Germans were aghast at any arrangement in which their savings were on the hook for the recklessness of Greeks and Italians.\n\n\u201cShe had to sell German voters on the idea that Germany would send resources to bail out European countries that were already engaged in irresponsible policies,\u201d said Nicola Borri, a finance professor at Luiss, a university in Rome. \u201cThat was the problem. Politically, it\u2019s really hard to criticize Merkel.\u201d\n\nIn Mr. Borri\u2019s view, Italy and other nations on Europe\u2019s southern periphery did receive a significant infusion of wealth from the north when the euro was created nearly two decades ago. Investors began lending money to Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal at rates that were practically the same as those in Germany, no longer demanding a premium for extra risk. Here was a choice dividend from sharing a currency with Germany and its rock-solid credit.\n\n\u201cThese are de facto transfers from rich to poor countries,\u201d Mr. Borri said. \u201cRather than use this money to reform their economies, these countries increased their spending.\u201d\n\nBut other economists say Ms. Merkel squandered an opportunity to use the crisis as a teachable moment that could have altered German public opinion. She might have fostered a sense of responsibility in Germany to see the nation as a primary beneficiary of the European Union, with the responsibility to aid those in distress.\n\nInstead, she catered to stereotypes of lazy Greeks, at one point suggesting they take too much vacation. She used their troubles to inaccurately depict the breadth of the crisis. Though Greece\u2019s government had been profligate, those in Ireland and Spain had enjoyed budget surpluses before they landed in crisis, falling into perilous debts only after bailing out banks.\n\nEurope\u2019s economic troubles have frequently centered on a dearth of faith in the endurance of the euro, the currency shared by 19 members of the bloc. Since the euro\u2019s inception, critics have warned that it is structurally unsound \u2014 a currency union lacking an accompanying political apparatus to coordinate policy and collective aid when trouble emerges.", "\u201cAt our office, there is not a week that goes by that we don\u2019t get video from parents of an 8-year-old playing soccer or football and the parent wants us to look at the call,\u201d said Barry Mano, the president and founder of NASO.\n\nSports psychologists are now trying to better understand why a growing number of parents are becoming increasingly emotionally overinvested in their children\u2019s athletics. They cite several reasons some parents take their child\u2019s swim meet or soccer match very seriously.\n\nMoney is a top reason. Parents spend a lot of time and financial resources on youth sports, which can prompt some to want a payoff greater than watching their children perform well or enjoy themselves. Some expect a significant return on their investment, perhaps through a college scholarship or professional sports contract.\n\nParents\u2019 behavior covers a wide continuum, said Travis Dorsch, an assistant professor and founding director of the Families in Sport Lab at Utah State University. On one end, \u201cMom and Dad are content to spend the money, and they are supportive and they don\u2019t say a lot,\u201d Dr. Dorsch said. At the other end, parents expect their child to perform well and express disappointment if their child or the team does not meet expectations. \u201cIn other families, little Johnny goes to Orlando for a tournament and doesn\u2019t play, and on the plane ride home they have a discussion,\u201d he said.\n\nA 2016 study in the Journal of Family Relations by Dr. Dorsch and colleagues found an inverse relationship between a child\u2019s perception of their family\u2019s commitment to youth athletics and their enjoyment of the sport. The study examined data from a national sample of 163 parent-child pairs \u2014 78 fathers and 85 mothers. The families were fairly affluent, with a median income topping $120,000 a year, and more than three-fourths of the parents had a college degree.", "I told my doctor recently that I sometimes experience rapid heart rate. She wasn\u2019t too concerned but gave me an EKG anyway, perhaps for liability purposes. I\u2019m in my 50s, after all, a decade in which important organs often begin to show their wear.\n\nA medical assistant came into the room and placed a dozen little tabs on my chest and legs and then attached little wires to them with clips that looked like telephone jacks.\n\nThe technology had certainly advanced from the 1970s, when I had my first EKG at the age of 12, before undergoing surgery to repair a hole between the upper chambers of my heart. By the time I\u2019d graduated from sixth grade, I\u2019d had about a dozen EKGs, as well as a catheterization, a procedure in which a small tube or catheter is inserted into a vein in your leg and photographed as it makes its way toward your heart. The doctors made a short video of my procedure that they let me watch afterward. At the start of the film, my name was spelled out in white block letters on a black background, as an actress\u2019s name might be on her screen test.\n\nThat period of my life has become part of the fabric of who I am, like an outside force that makes a tree grow one way or another.

Some said they have left evangelicalism altogether.\n\nWe read every submission and spent many hours interviewing respondents. Here\u2019s what we learned:\n\nYoung evangelicals are questioning the typical ties between evangelicalism and Republican politics. Many said it had caused schisms within their families.

And tracking where food comes from!\n\nPerhaps it will save journalism, too?\n\nNov. 1, 2018\n\nAlas, the Blockchain Won\u2019t Save Journalism After All\n\nHype around the technology has led to incomprehensible applications of it.\n\nCivil Media Company was introduced earlier this year as both a media platform and a network, to be owned and operated by journalists and concerned citizens in tandem. It was an exciting proposal. Its technology (powered by the blockchain!) would churn under dozens of independent newsrooms, its machinery creating a new, utopian model, free from the clutches of miserly businessmen or politically compromised publishers threatening to gum up the works.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the ad-driven business model is slowly killing good journalism \u2014 which is itself a critical foundation for free, democratic societies,\u201d wrote one of the company\u2019s founders, Matt Coolidge, in one of many, many, many blog posts that have been written trying to explain Civil. \u201cSo, we\u2019re introducing a new model.\u201d\n\nFundamental to the model was an option for readers: They could buy into Civil, with a Civil-specific crypto token, which would somehow free journalists to take advantage of \u201cself-governance\u201d and \u201cpermanence,\u201d Mr. Coolidge wrote. With this financing, Civil would be able to cut out advertisers, clickbaiters and all the other bad actors so often accused of screwing up journalism.\n\nCivil took its currency to market in September for a month. In the end, it fell short of the minimum number of tokens it had hoped to sell by more than $6 million. Of the approximately $1.4 million worth of tokens the company did sell, about 80 percent was purchased by ConsenSys \u2014 the blockchain software company that underwrote Civil in the first place.

Nearly one in every four people killed here since March have died at the hands of the state.\n\nOpinion polls suggest a broad majority of people in Rio de Janeiro support the military intervention.

Here is an edited version of the conversation:\n\nWhy is it important to you to take your children along on trips?\n\nThe main reason we take our kids is because we want to go and we don\u2019t want to be apart from them. They\u2019re still too little to truly enjoy the magic and adventure of travel, although Vale is getting there. We went to Wyoming this summer and on the flight home she said she didn\u2019t want to return to New York City because it was \u201cboring\u201d compared to our trip.\n\nWhat was the first trip you took with your children?\n\nWe took Vale to a friend\u2019s wedding in Jamaica when she was 4 months old. I remember being so nervous about the travel but little did I know, traveling with an infant is as easy as traveling with children will ever get. I think she slept the whole flight. The hardest part was all the \u201cstuff.\u201d My personal rule is take three times what you need for the carry-on: triple the number of diapers, triple the number of outfits, triple the number of bottles, bibs, burp cloths etc. etc. Bring quintuple the number of pacifiers and some wipes because all they do is throw them under the seat.\n\nHow do you decide when to bring the whole family along?\n\nOur default position is to take the kids. But the biggest factor is the length of the trip. If it is just a quick weekend and we are doing mostly adult things (such as our trip to Chicago in September to watch tennis at the Laver Cup) then we leave them home. They\u2019re happier at home in their own beds, and there is no point in bringing them and then leaving them in the hotel room with a babysitter. But by and large, we don\u2019t travel unless we can bring the little ones.\n\nAny advice on getting through a flight with children?\n\nWe are pretty strict about screen time at home but our basic policy for travel is \u201cPirate Rules\u201d \u2014 which, loosely translated, means \u201canything goes.\u201d We let Vale watch movies for a long time if it keeps her happy and under control. Same rule for snacks \u2014 we let them have treats they wouldn\u2019t normally have if it keeps the peace. We are doing it for fellow passengers as much as ourselves.\n\nHow do you choose which hotel to stay in with your family?\n\nI don\u2019t have particular recommendations but obviously hotels that are used to hosting children are better. I don\u2019t like bringing the kids to a hotel where other adult guests might be annoyed.", "Now, according to an annual survey by the Babson Survey Research Group and the Online Learning Consortium, more than 6.3 million students took at least one distance education course in the Fall 2016 semester (the most recent academic year for which data is available). That\u2019s 31.6 percent of all higher education enrollments, according to the study, and about half of them were taking all of their classes online.\n\nMany of these students are traditional age. But for adult students (generally defined as those 25 and over, working full-time jobs or with parenting responsibilities) online education is a particularly attractive option. Citing several studies, Louis Soares, chief learning and innovation officer for the American Council on Education, says that about a third of all adult students \u2014 roughly 13 million \u2014 are pursuing advanced degrees online.\n\n\u201cI think it has given adult students more opportunities,\u201d Mr. Soares said. \u201cIf done correctly, online education can create a robust learning experience.\u201d\n\nResearch has shown that students can learn as well online as they can in a face to face classroom, according to Jovita Ross-Gordon, a professor at Texas State University.\n\n\u201cIn terms of pros and cons, it offers great convenience and access for populations who might not otherwise have it,\u201d said Professor Ross-Gordon, an expert on adult education. \u201cBut a certain degree of self direction is required. And it can be isolating for some folks.\u201d\n\nThe vast majority of colleges and universities in the United States offer at least some online classes, but there are still those who question its legitimacy and also the quality of for-profit colleges whose curriculum is offered solely online.\n\nWalden University, where Mr. Haynes is earning his doctoral degree, is one such institution. He said that he researched the school through the V.A. and other sources, and heard positive reports from a friend who was also pursuing his doctorate in business administration at Walden, which Mr. Haynes learned was accredited by the Accreditation Council for Business Schools.", "There is no parenting book that explains how to walk your daughter through the standard operating procedures for sniper fire.

We would read that instead. I was disgusted by our minutes reliving part of my past. The choose-your-adventure format felt breezy and cavalier, recklessly presenting a bloody contest between the Taliban and the Marines in a manner largely devoid of consequences. I know what the book did not say. My friends and I killed in Marjah, and Marines in my rifle company lost limbs and lives. No notional exercise in choice will erase the fact that both my battalion and the battalion to our north killed many civilians in the opening days of Operation Moshtarak, when American high-explosive rockets struck occupied Afghan homes. Then, in the end, American plans for the area failed. Today Marjah is again under of the control of the Taliban and warlords.\n\nMaybe this moment of discomfort in my home was inevitable. My daughters were, quite naturally, trying to figure out a piece of their lives that everyone seemed to know more about than they did. Eventually I will honestly discuss my time in Marjah with them. I will tell them about the time one of their uncles and I commandeered an Afghan National Army truck for a joy ride. I will tell them about the Marines who died, and how much I miss them every day. Finally, I will tell them about the family I escorted to a graveyard. Their baby had died because, fearing the Taliban, they couldn\u2019t get to a hospital. I will tell them about the white blanket that enveloped their child held tightly in the father\u2019s arms as we led them to the burial grounds.\n\nI will tell them that I took lives in combat, because they deserve to hear it. I will tell them the truth. I pray that by then the truth won\u2019t tarnish their idea of who I was in the Marine Corps. Until then, I won\u2019t participate in the presentation of the Afghan war as an adventure. Some who were among us never came home. Those who did can\u2019t turn to page 103 and see the conclusion or turn to page 11 and start a new adventure.

For example, single-parent families can choose to dine with others like them and may also be paired for shore excursions, so children have a chance to make new friends, and parents have other adults to interact with. Additionally, all four of Disney\u2019s ships have planned activities for solo parents and every sailing offers kids and teen clubs with activities all day that are included in the cost of the cruise.\n\nMs. McNally and her sons had such a good time on that trip, roughly four years ago, that they\u2019ve since been on nine more Disney cruises, including one last December to the Bahamas. \u201cThe setup on the boats made me and the boys completely relaxed,\u201d Ms. McNally said.\n\nDisney Cruise Line is among the several travel companies that increasingly cater to single parent families by grouping them with others who have a similar family setup and offering them price breaks. Some companies have even introduced specific single-parent itineraries.\n\nThe river cruise line CroisiEurope, for example, normally charges single adult travelers a supplement fee that\u2019s 30 percent of the total cruise fare (a weeklong all-inclusive trip costs around $2500). In July and August, however, this fee is waived for single parents on select European cruises when they\u2019re traveling with children who are 16 or younger; children on these itineraries also sail for free. In addition, the supplement is waived on the company\u2019s Christmas market cruises on the Danube and Rhine River.\n\nMichael DaCosta, CroisiEurope\u2019s marketing manager, said that the company introduced these incentives a few years ago in an attempt to broaden its customer base.", "Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night\u2019s highlights that lets you sleep \u2014 and lets us get paid to watch comedy.

After years of stardom in Pop Art, he pondered his future. \u201cI was confused because I wasn\u2019t painting and I wasn\u2019t filming there,\u201d he recalled.\n\nInstead, he watched his minions taking care of business. They were shooting movies under his name, selling his prints and finding him portrait commissions \u2014 one way or another, making money with art. \u201cI knew that work was going on, even if I didn\u2019t have any idea what the work would come to.\u201d\n\nThat corporate work, Warhol soon came to realize, was actually some of the most important art he ever made. Business Art, he came to call it, \u201cthe step that comes after art.\u201d It established that everything this artist had done or would do, as head of Andy Warhol Enterprises, Inc. \u2014 as portraitist, publisher, publicist or salesman \u2014 counted as components in one boundless work: part performance art, part conceptual art and part picture of the market world he lived in and that we all still inhabit.\n\nNow the Whitney Museum of American Art is about to open a major new Warhol survey. Titled \u201cAndy Warhol \u2014 From A to B and Back Again,\u201d it stars a full cross-section of his epochal creations: The Soup Cans and Marilyns of the early 1960s, which held up a mirror to American commodity culture; the experimental films of his Factory years; the society portraits, homoerotica and almost-abstractions of his last two decades. All treasures, without a doubt, but maybe just as significant for the times we now live in as aspects of his Business Art project.", "At times my goal is to broaden my audience by using iconography or symbols so that anyone can relate to the work. I think about stencils and Warhol, and the way his hand is not present in the work, which at one point might have been controversial. Is that important? Or is the art really about the thoughts behind it? All my stencils I make myself, but I use everyday imagery as inspiration, to make a new kind of gesture loaded with many meanings.\n\nI relate to the way Andy Warhol used pop imagery that aspires to some kind of universality. You see this in \u201cLittle Race Riot\u201d from his \u201cDeath and Disasters\u201d series, which deals with how ubiquitous media portrayals of violence, over time, make us numb to them. It\u2019s similar to how social media presents images today, over and over, making us indifferent to things that are important. In my pieces centered around police brutality, like \u201cWhy\u201d \u2014 where I use an \u201cX\u201d to cover text and to make a word appear as two different possibilities \u2014 I was thinking about the ambiguity of Andy Warhol. He never wanted to give a specific meaning, so the viewer could participate equally. He was great at making us refocus on important things by blowing them up into symbols, but he didn\u2019t give too much away.\n\nThis idea of accessibility led me to do merchandise and murals. It\u2019s challenging myself to go into spaces where there might not be a lot of women of color. It also allowed me to challenge the idea that I couldn\u2019t have a painting that\u2019s in the Whitney collection and then have a pair of sneakers in a store. Can a very expensive painting and my work in an alleyway function in the same way? Warhol showed us it could. Someone who might play on a basketball court painted by me might not go in an art gallery but I want to reach them. This desire comes from my own encounters with art. I never went to a lot of museums growing up, and I was exposed to the gallery scene very late.\n\n\u201cNina Chanel Abney: Royal Flush\u201d is at the California African-American Museum in Los Angeles through Jan. 20.", "But all together they create a predigital Facebook, she added, \u201cmapping subcultures\u201d from socialites to rock stars. \u201cIt\u2019s their desire to be painted by Warhol, to receive his imprimatur, that brings it all together,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite different than having your portrait done by any of the great 19th-century painters.\u201d\n\nThe portraits certainly weren\u2019t seen that way at the time of their making. In November 1979, when the Whitney staged a show including 112 commissioned portraits, the media reception was largely brutal. \u201cWarhol\u2019s admirers,\u201d Robert Hughes of Time magazine wrote, \u201care given to claiming that Warhol has \u2018revived\u2019 the social portrait as a form. It would be nearer the truth to say he has zipped its corpse into a Halston, painted its eyelids and propped it in the back of a limo, where it moves but cannot speak.\u201d\n\nYet despite the critical eye-rolling, Mr. Colacello called these portraits \u201cthe bread and butter\u201d for Warhol\u2019s empire. During the \u201970s, shows of new work like the Skulls series in Europe \u2014 where Warhol still had a loyal base of collectors \u2014 generated about $800,000 each ($2.3 million in today\u2019s dollars), hardly enough to cover the growing overhead. The $25,000 commissioned portraits, with an extra $15,000 typically charged for every additional panel, made up the difference. \u201cWe\u2019d have people for lunch at the Factory a lot, and we\u2019d conveniently have Marella Agnelli\u2019s or Mick Jagger\u2019s portrait leaning against the wall,\u201d Mr. Colacello said. \u201cPeople would say \u2018Those are so great! How much are they? I should have my wife done!\u2019\u201d\n\nFirst came a photography session. A Polaroid shot of the subject was then blown up into a 40 x 40 image and silk-screened onto canvas, but only after Warhol had meticulously cut away any less-than-flattering wrinkles and double chins. Upon delivery of the finished portrait, the salesmanship began anew. \u201cIf someone ordered two panels, he would paint four, hoping they would then take them all. Sometimes when people saw how great four looked side by side, they would open their checkbooks a little more,\u201d Mr. Colacello recalled. By the early \u201980s, new commissions had soared. Warhol was painting about 50 a year, grossing nearly $5 million annually when adjusted for inflation.\n\nFor generations who have come of age long after Warhol\u2019s death in 1987, grids of these portraits are often viewed as his signature work \u2014 their eye-popping colors and scattershot brushwork atop a repeating washed-out image serving as shorthand for not only the artist\u2019s overall style, but the very aura of fame itself. Even the art world establishment has come around: Museums worldwide now embrace them as essential examples of modern-day portraiture.", "bad url", "bad url", "The social network also put me on the phone with a top executive who argued boisterously for Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s leadership, but declined to do so on the record.

The executive argued that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s total domination of Facebook\u2019s equity, plus the reverence in which employees hold him, allowed him to weather the financial consequences of these changes better than any other leader.\n\nFacebook\u2019s stock price plunged nearly 20 percent on a single day this summer after it reported slowing revenue growth and increased operational costs. This week, Facebook repeated its slower-growth warning. A \u201cprofessional C.E.O.,\u201d one without such a huge stake in the company, would be tempted to try the easy way out, the executive suggested.

He has said fixing Facebook was his personal challenge for 2018. But there are signs that its culture remains the same.\n\nConsider its promise that a new home-hub device, Portal, which it unveiled this month, would not collect information on users that could be used in ads. It had to swiftly walk back that promise because Facebook\u2019s data-collection system is so pervasive that even some of its employees don\u2019t seem to understand it.\n\n\u201cI think he has demonstrably failed over the last two years, and the reason he\u2019s failed is because he\u2019s unaccountable,\u201d said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook employee who is now chief strategy officer for the Center of Humane Technology, an activist organization. \u201cGiven a scenario where shareholders and board members had more influence, it\u2019s hard to imagine that there would not have been changes faster.\u201d", "bad url", "Until now, South Korea has prosecuted more young men for conscientious objection than any other country, and it was one of the few that treated it as a crime without offering a different form of national service.

"McCovey was honored with his fellow Giants Hall of Famers Mays, Gaylord Perry, Juan Marichal and Orlando Cepeda at the team\u2019s AT&T Park before Game 3 of the 2014 World Series, in which the Giants defeated the Kansas City Royals in seven games. The Giants have presented a Willie Mac Award annually since 1980 to a San Francisco player exemplifying McCovey\u2019s spirit and leadership.\n\nWillie Lee McCovey was born in Mobile, Ala., on Jan. 10, 1938, the seventh of 10 children of Frank and Ester McCovey. His father was a railroad laborer. An outstanding first baseman in sandlot baseball, he was signed to the New York Giants\u2019 minor league system in 1955 and soon earned a reputation as a power hitter.\n\nMcCovey made his major league debut with a flourish on July 30, 1959, when he went 4 for 4, hitting two triples and two singles off Robin Roberts, the Philadelphia Phillies\u2019 future Hall of Fame right-hander.\n\nMcCovey played in only 52 games that season, but he hit .354 with 13 home runs and was named rookie of the year.\n\nMany San Francisco fans regarded Mays as the symbol of New York baseball in its golden age of the 1950s, a hero of the Polo Grounds. They focused their adulation on McCovey and the slugging Cepeda, who switched to the outfield to make room for McCovey at first base. They were local heroes in the pioneering years of major league baseball on the West Coast, with the Giants in San Francisco and the Brooklyn Dodgers having moved to Los Angeles.\n\nMcCovey tied Hank Aaron as the N.L.\u2019s home run leader in 1963 with 44, which coincidentally was also both men\u2019s jersey number. (McCovey had chosen the number to honor Aaron, a fellow Mobile native.) He had 36 homers and 105 R.B.I. in 1968, and 45 homers and 126 R.B.I. in 1969, leading the league in both categories each of those seasons. He hit .320 in 1969, when he won most valuable player honors.", "\u201cMarket guards or police officials would ask me to follow them to an empty room outside the market, or some other place they\u2019d pick,\u201d said a former trader in her 40s. \u201cThey consider us toys. We are at the mercy of men.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d she said of the psychological torment from such abuse, \u201cout of nowhere, you cry at night and don\u2019t know why.\u201d\n\nThe women interviewed by Human Rights Watch said they seldom reported the crimes for fear of reprisal, and because of widespread stigma attached to rape victims. The coerced sex has become so common that the men don\u2019t think their actions are wrong, and the women have come to accept such behavior, some said.\n\n\u201cCorruption is so rampant that anybody without power has no choice,\u201d said the husband of the trader in her 40s. \u201cTraders like my wife have to accept that sexual coercion is part of social and market dynamics. It is the only way to survive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what I know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d\n\nAlso vulnerable are women who enter China illegally to find work or smuggle goods. When they are caught and repatriated, they are exposed to widespread sexual and other abuse in holding centers and prisons, according to Human Rights Watch, whose report echoed earlier findings on that issue.\n\nIn a 2014 survey of 1,125 North Korean defectors by the South\u2019s Korea Institute for National Unification, nearly 38 percent said that sexual harassment and rape were \u201ccommon\u201d in those facilities. Thirty-three of the defectors said they had been raped there.\n\n\u201cEvery night, some woman would be forced to leave with a guard and be raped,\u201d a former trader in her 30s who was detained in a holding center told Human Rights Watch. \u201cClick, click, click was the most horrible sound I ever heard.

(\u201cI love what \u201cPose\u201d did,\u201d Smollett said, because \u201cthey\u2019re right in the heart of the beginning, and we\u2019re able to tell it in present day.\u201d)", "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Netflix softened its longstanding view on movie distribution, saying late Wednesday that it would release three prestige movies in a way that it had repeatedly said was a nonstarter \u2014 in cinemas first, and on the streaming service later.\n\nA limited number of theaters in the United States and overseas will receive an exclusive period of one to three weeks to play the films, which include Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cRoma,\u201d a black-and-white drama hailed as a masterpiece by critics who have seen it at festivals. After that, Netflix will make the films available for streaming.\n\nNetflix expects theaters to continue playing the films even after it flips them to streaming, with the number of locations dependent on ticket sales, reviews and whether Academy Awards attention materializes as Netflix hopes. The other films are \u201cThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs,\u201d a six-part frontier anthology written and directed by Ethan and Joel Coen, and \u201cBird Box,\u201d a thriller starring Sandra Bullock and Sarah Paulson.\n\nMost theater chains, including AMC and Regal, insist on a 90-day period of exclusivity. They worry that moviegoers will be reluctant to buy tickets if they know they can catch the same film just a few weeks (or days) later in their living rooms, and for less money. Single tickets cost $15 or more in New York and Los Angeles. A basic Netflix subscription is $8 monthly.", "MADRID \u2014 A Spanish artist painted a dove on the tomb of Gen. Francisco Franco on Wednesday as a protest against the former dictator, the latest in a series of controversies over his tomb and plans to move his remains.\n\nThe artist, Enrique Tenreiro, smuggled red paint through the security gate of the huge underground basilica that Franco had built, spray-painting the words \u201cFor Freedom\u201d along with the dove on the tomb.\n\nMr. Tenreiro, who was taken away by a guard and faces a police investigation, issued a statement saying that he had not meant to offend Franco\u2019s family and supporters, but had wanted to \u201calleviate the suffering of those who lost a Civil War that shouldn\u2019t have occurred.\u201d\n\nWhat does the government plan to do with Franco\u2019s remains?\n\nThe protest came amid a heated debate set off by Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s decision to exhume Franco\u2019s remains from the basilica, built on a site known as the Valley of the Fallen, an hour\u2019s drive from Madrid.", "The worst thing about the rallies is that Trump keeps coming back to immigration, even though recent events have made it crystal clear that this is poisoning the nation. (\u201cWe\u2019re getting prepared for the caravan folks, you don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d)\n\nHe\u2019s now adding a plug for his new plan to toss out the part of the Constitution that says if you\u2019re born here, you\u2019re a citizen \u2014 an idea that has even Paul Ryan reeling. (\u201cPeople didn\u2019t want to bring it up. I said we have to bring it up.\u201d)\n\nWe know now that both the alleged pipe bomb-maker and the synagogue shooting suspect were obsessed with immigrants. Immigrant-bashing is what Trump thinks is the key to winning the midterms. It\u2019s also the place where Trump becomes an abettor in the right-wing, white nationalist turmoil that\u2019s torturing the country.\n\nIt\u2019s insane to expect him to lift up the nation. But is it too much to ask that he just avoid the violence-inducing themes in his repertoire?\n\nFor instance, he loves to remind his fans that he won the election, and that\u2019s a safe topic. Maybe he could devote half an hour of every rally to his theory that it\u2019s harder to win electoral votes than the popular vote. Plus crowd estimates \u2014 he could spend some time claiming that 47 percent of the entire population of Fort Wayne, Ind., was standing outside the door, in terrible weather, just to watch him on closed-circuit television.\n\nWe\u2019re better off if he talks about the mysterious promise of a 10 percent tax cut known to no one in Washington but Donald Trump. And the Space Force! (\u201cSo important. That\u2019s where it\u2019s at.\u201d)\n\nWhat else could he say that isn\u2019t dangerous? Well \u2014 he could talk about the things the Republican majority did over the last two years. O.K., that definitely wouldn\u2019t fill up an hour.", "Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Ryan Zinke, the secretary of the Interior Department and a key figure in President Trump\u2019s push to roll back environmental regulations and ramp up oil drilling, is facing increased scrutiny amid federal investigations into allegations that he abused travel spending and maintained close ties with industries he oversees.\n\nThe criticism escalated sharply after reports this week that the Interior Department\u2019s inspector general had referred one of the inquiries to the Justice Department, a potential prelude to a criminal investigation.\n\nT\u200bhe\u200b\u200b investigations have raised questions about Mr. Zinke\u2019s oversight of the Interior Department, where he is essentially the largest land manager in the United States. He has authority over the nation\u2019s 300 million acres of public lands as well as vast waters off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nMr. Zinke faces at least a half-dozen ethics investigations. At least nine other inquiries into alleged ethics violations have been closed, in some cases because Mr. Zinke was cleared, in others because of a lack of cooperation with investigators.", "A federal grand jury on Wednesday indicted a man who the authorities say killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue while spewing anti-Semitic slurs on 44 counts, including hate crimes. He could face the death penalty.\n\nThe indictment, handed up by a federal grand jury in western Pennsylvania, charges Robert Bowers, 46, with 11 counts of obstruction of free exercise of religious freedom resulting in death, and 11 counts of using a firearm during a crime of violence.\n\nMr. Bowers pleaded not guilty in federal court on Thursday. The maximum penalty he could receive if convicted is death, or life without parole plus 535 additional years of imprisonment.\n\n\u201cEvery American has the right to attend their house of worship in safety,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThe defendant in this case allegedly murdered 11 innocent people during religious services and injured four law enforcement officers. These alleged crimes are incomprehensibly evil and utterly repugnant to the values of this nation.\u201d", "Editors\u2019 Note: November 14, 2018\n\nAn earlier version of this article included a conclusion from a stdy about ocean warming that is now in doubt. The authors of the study are working to revise their report because of errors detected in their calculations and it appears unlikely that they will be able to support their original conclusion that the oceans have warmed an average of 60 percent more per year than the current official estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The sections of the article dealing with that conclusion have been removed and the headline has been updated.\n\nHow do you take the ocean\u2019s temperature?\n\nThe question might sound like the prelude to a children\u2019s joke. But for climate scientists, the answer has serious consequences.\n\nClimate change is rapidly warming the world\u2019s oceans, killing off aquatic organisms \u2014 like coral reefs and kelp forests \u2014 that anchor entire ecosystems. The warmer waters also cause sea levels to rise and make extreme weather events like hurricanes more destructive.\n\nIn October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the global organization for climate data, released a major report predicting that some of the worst effects of climate change \u2014 including coastal flooding, food shortages and a mass die-off of coral reefs \u2014 could come to pass as soon as 2040 if human greenhouse gas emissions continue at current levels. The I.P.C.C. report showed that scientists may have been underestimating the severity of the world\u2019s present climate trajectory.", "A similar point of view characterizes the films of Dinesh D\u2019Souza, the polemicist who had pleaded guilty to making illegal campaign contributions in 2014, only to be pardoned by President Trump this year. Moviegoers did not have to go out of their way to catch Mr. D\u2019Souza\u2019s most recent effort, \u201cDeath of a Nation.\u201d The film had a wide release last summer, playing in more than 1,000 theaters, including those belonging to the AMC and Cinemark chains.\n\nThe film makes the case that the Nazi platform was similar to that of today\u2019s Democratic Party. Prominent among its villains is George Soros, who was allegedly sent a pipe bomb by Cesar Sayoc Jr., who also is accused of sending similar packages to Hillary Clinton and Mr. Obama.\n\n\u201cThe progressive Democrats are the true racists,\u201d the film\u2019s narrator intones. \u201cThey are the true fascists. They want to steal our income. They want to steal our earnings and our wealth and our freedom and our lives.\u201d\n\nThe PG-13 rated film had a box office take of roughly $6 million, which paled next to the $33 million brought in by \u201cObama\u2019s America,\u201d a 2012 film by Mr. D\u2019Souza that claimed Mr. Obama, as the president, sought to destroy the United States from within to sate the \u201canti-Colonialism\u201d impulses of the African father he hardly knew.\n\n\u201cDeath of a Nation\u201d will have a second life on the streaming platforms Amazon, iTunes and Google Play, as well as on DVD, sold at Walmart, Best Buy and other retailers. The distribution is being handled by Quality Flix and Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.\n\nThe Incitement Industry can also be a driving force at Fox News, which has lately featured guests who have asserted without evidence that Mr. Soros financed the migrant caravan making its slow way toward the southern border of the United States. Someone who shared that view was the man charged with killing 11 congregants during a hate-driven shooting rampage at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.", "A trail of blood led from one apartment to another. That was the first clue that led the police to suspect a 24-year-old woman in the fatal stabbing of her neighbor in an Upper West Side co-op.\n\nDetectives made inquiries. The young woman, who lived with her mother, had been hospitalized for mental illness. A search of her apartment turned up other evidence, the police said, including blood on a shoe.\n\nOn Wednesday, more than a week later, the police arrested the woman, Anya Johnston, on charges she slashed the throat of Susan Trott, a 70-year-old advertising copywriter who lived one floor below her, the police said.\n\nMs. Johnston was charged with murder and burglary. The police said she was emotionally disturbed. The week of the murder, Ms. Johnston had been reported missing by her mother, but eventually had returned home, the police said. She told her family that she was mentally unstable and was taken to Mount Sinai St. Luke\u2019s hospital on the day of the murder, the police said. She had undergone a psychiatric evaluation before she was taken into custody on Wednesday.", "On the Sabbath, which starts at sundown on Friday, the Jewish tradition is to say a prayer while lighting two candles, attend synagogue and have dinner with family, along with prayers over wine and challah. On Saturday morning, Jews return to synagogue for services.\n\nMr. Harris said he saw no better place for people to show support for the Jewish community than at a synagogue, a space meant for peace and community that was turned into one of brutal violence in Pittsburgh last week.\n\nAt Park East Synagogue in Manhattan, clergy members are expecting a significantly larger crowd than on a typical Sabbath, said Benny Rogosnitzky, a cantor at the congregation. They plan to address the tragedy in Pittsburgh directly in a prayer and the rabbi\u2019s sermon, Mr. Rogosnitzky said.\n\nSince Saturday\u2019s shooting, religious people outside the Jewish faith have found other ways to demonstrate their solidarity with Jews. For example, two Muslim organizations have raised more than $200,000 to help victims and their families following the massacre.\n\nAnd Greg Zanis, a retired carpenter who has made tens of thousands of wooden crosses to memorialize the dead, traveled to Pittsburgh from Illinois this week to install 11 Stars of David near the Tree of Life synagogue. Mr. Zanis, who has been constructing such memorials for about 20 years, said he tried to honor all faiths \u2014 as well as those who did not subscribe to one during their lives."]
