It was her fourth victory here, and the second fastest race any woman has run on this course.\n\nIt started out typically enough. For the first half of the race, Keitany, 36, tucked into a pack of about 24 women, including some of the top talent in this event.

You can sometimes go to a county\u2019s website and find an open data or geography section, where you can download the shapes. But that\u2019s not always the case. You may have to contact the counties and ask them to send the information. A couple of places wanted to mail maps to us because they didn\u2019t have them electronically. The next step is matching the precinct maps with the data.\n\nHow has The Times\u2019s approach to interactive election maps evolved?\n\nBLOCH The first election I worked on was the presidential one in 2008. One of the models for designing an interactive map then involved pretty complex interactions, like using buttons to see different views of the data. Whenever possible, we\u2019ve tried to pare away interactions that readers may not understand by just looking at a map. Simplicity is one of our guiding principles.\n\nWe also had more stand-alone interactives in the past. Along with making our graphics simpler, we now combine them with blocks of text.\n\nWe\u2019ve turned against the kind of map that just shows a lot of data and puts the burden of analyzing it on the user \u2014 though our election results maps show a bit more data because we feel it\u2019s important to display the full outcome of elections.\n\nLEE We\u2019ve also made space for people to explore the data. We want to give you the necessary information when you first get to the page so that, if you find that interesting, you can dig deeper.\n\nHow do you come up with ideas for new interactive maps?\n\nTSE They come from a lot of different places in the newsroom, from within our department and from The Upshot, with which we collaborate very frequently. We\u2019re always thinking about what could help readers understand the world better.\n\nWhat maps have been most popular with readers?\n\nTSE The \u201cExtremely Detailed Map of the 2016 Election\u201d was very well received. Readers really enjoyed seeing how their block voted, how their neighborhood voted.", "With Election Day at hand, we know one thing for sure: Voter turnout is huge. In fact, it looks like we will have the highest midterm turnout since 1966. The rationale for a gigantic blue wave that would represent a repudiation of the 2016 election has been that millions of Americans are so turned off by President Trump and his agenda that they will come out en masse and hand Congress to Democrats with large majorities, proving what has been an article of faith among Trump-haters, that his election was an anomaly and that American politics would quickly revert to the mean.\n\nBut that\u2019s not going to happen \u2014 because it relies on a false premise. Republicans don\u2019t want to go back to the Bush-McCain-Romney era any more than Democrats want to go back to Clintonism. And since the Kavanaugh hearings, Republicans are just as energized and united as Democrats. That means everything is up for grabs. This election, in other words, is part of a process in which the electorate is working toward a new political dispensation that will replace the one that prevailed from the end of World War II until sometime during the Obama administration.\n\nWhat seems most likely is that we will get a split decision. As of now, Republicans are set up to increase their majority in the Senate, while Democrats have some advantages in the House. Though things are moving quickly and Democrats have had to spend money to defend incumbents in what should be safe seats. Senator Bob Menendez in New Jersey and Representative Jim Costa in California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley both have Republicans nipping at their heels. Democrats remain likely to win both races, but if this were really a wave election they wouldn\u2019t be close.\n\nSavvy Democrats who have worked elections \u2014 and not just keyboards \u2014 realized early-on that they over-promised and began to lower expectations for a wave election. The wholesale rejection of Mr. Trump that has been confidently predicted since the Women\u2019s March that took place the day after his inauguration is not in the cards. It never was. His opponents should remember that whatever they think of the man or his policies, he won more votes than any Republican ever, remains very popular with his own party and is presiding over an economic boom. We have robust economic growth, the lowest unemployment rate since 1969 and \u2014 finally \u2014 somewhat higher wages. What\u2019s more, the country is at peace, having largely wound down its ill-advised wars in Afghanistan and the Middle East while still pursuing a policy that has degraded Isis as a threat. A lot of voters who are not deeply ideological will look at that, or simply experience it in their own lives, and wonder why they should make a change. Things are going well.", "DELRAY BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Let me take you back to a time when Democrats and Republicans could breathe the same air without choking on it.\n\nIt was in 2002 that they worked together to make the ads that flood the airwaves every election season a little less nasty.\n\nThat year, the \u201cStand By Your Ad\u201d provision was passed as part of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. Ever since, anyone running for federal office has had to utter this brief refrain as part of every commercial: \u201cI\u2019m so-and-so and I approve this message.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers\u2019 idea was simple.

Desisa and Kitata, for instance, have each run more than a full minute faster on other courses.\n\nKitata was making his debut in New York and appeared to make a rookie mistake by jumping in front early and pushing the pace. The runner-up in the London Marathon this year, Kitata was unable to shake a pack of runners that included Kamworor, Desisa and Daniel Wanjiru of Kenya, who won the London Marathon in 2017.\n\nKitata held his ground as the pack caught up to him coming off the Queensboro Bridge, the second-highest point in the race, around Mile 16. At that point, the lead runners were on pace to run about 2:07, a very fast time for New York. As the group headed up First Avenue, Kamworor started to assert himself. He let Kitata push the pace, but a couple of times, he motioned to other runners to help box in Kitata.\n\nBut the lead pack was down to Kitata, Desisa and Kamworor as they passed quickly through the Bronx, down the Madison Avenue Bridge and back into Manhattan. Heading down Fifth Avenue, Kamworor took off his gloves and threw them to the ground, as if to taunt Desisa and Kitata.\n\nKitata slowed and appeared spent, but Desisa stuck with Kamworor as they entered Central Park with about two miles to go.

The protest arrives as increasing attention is being paid to the extensive power that Amazon wields as a retailer \u2014 a power that is greatest in books.\n\nThe stores are calling their action Banned Booksellers Week.

It takes place during the reign of the 13th-century king Endre II, who is off at war when the action starts. Left behind is his queen, Gertrud, whose Meranian descent makes her suspiciously foreign in the eyes of Hungarian noblemen allied with the king. In the opening scene, Gertrud is seen blithely entertaining a roster of Meranian revelers at court.\n\nBank, the viceroy, the opera\u2019s tormented hero, learns that Melinda, his beloved wife, has been pursued by the queen\u2019s self-indulgent younger brother Otto, an overture Gertrud has encouraged. Melinda is repelled by Otto, who forces himself upon her, driving her to madness.\n\nThere are hints of Donizetti and Verdi in Erkel\u2019s score, passages of plaintive harmonic writing, and hymnlike choruses. Still, the opera is run through with arias that sound like four-square songs. And after the third or fourth (I lost count) stirring choral anthem in praise of the homeland, I had had enough.

The movie also brought in about $72.5 million internationally, according to Fox, for a global total of about $122.5 million.\n\nThe film received a somewhat lackluster reception from critics.

The young actress Mackenzie Foy stars alongside Keira Knightley, Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren, a celebrity cast that likely helped convince some families to see a holiday movie on the first weekend of November. But the initial results were disappointing for Disney, which spent well over $100 million to make the movie.", "\u4ece1955\u5e74\u52301972\u5e74\uff0c\u91d1\u5eb8\u5199\u4e8614\u90e8\u957f\u7bc7\u3001\u4e2d\u7bc7\u548c1\u90e8\u77ed\u7bc7\u6b66\u4fa0\u5c0f\u8bf4\u3002\u6b66\u4fa0\u662f\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u5c0f\u8bf4\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u8bb2\u8ff0\u5938\u5f20\u7684\u529f\u592b\u5192\u9669\u3002\n\n\u4ed6\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\u6b66\u4fa0\u5c0f\u8bf4\u300a\u4e66\u5251\u6069\u4ec7\u5f55\u300b\uff081955\u5e74\uff09\u7684\u7075\u611f\u6765\u81ea\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f20\u8bf4\uff1a\u6ee1\u65cf\u7687\u5e1d\u4e7e\u9686\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u662f\u4e2a\u6c49\u4eba\uff0c\u4ed6\u5728\u51fa\u751f\u65f6\u88ab\u6389\u5305\u3002\u5c0f\u8bf4\u5728\u300a\u65b0\u665a\u62a5\u300b\u8fde\u8f7d\uff0c\u4e00\u70ae\u800c\u7ea2\u3002\n\n\u4ed6\u5f00\u59cb\u5199\u4f5c\u7684\u90a3\u4e2a\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u7981\u6b62\u4e86\u6b66\u4fa0\u6587\u5b66\uff0c\u79f0\u4e4b\u4e3a\u201c\u8150\u673d\u201d\u201c\u5c01\u5efa\u201d\u3002\u7981\u4ee4\u4e5f\u53cd\u6620\u51fa\u4e2d\u56fd\u6587\u5b66\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u53e4\u8001\u89c2\u70b9\uff1a\u6b66\u4fa0\u662f\u4e0d\u5165\u6d41\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u9999\u6e2f\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u6563\u5c45\u6d77\u5916\u7684\u534e\u4eba\u5f53\u4e2d\uff0c\u91d1\u5eb8\u7684\u5c0f\u8bf4\u5728\u4e94\u516d\u5341\u5e74\u4ee3\u6380\u8d77\u4e86\u4e00\u80a1\u65b0\u7684\u6b66\u4fa0\u5c0f\u8bf4\u70ed\u6f6e\u3002\n\n\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u8bd7\u6b4c\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u5e7b\u60f3\uff0c\u91d1\u5eb8\u62d4\u9ad8\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5df2\u7ecf\u76f8\u5f53\u5957\u8def\u5316\u7684\u5c0f\u8bf4\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u521b\u9020\u51fa\u51e0\u767e\u4e2a\u751f\u52a8\u4eba\u7269\uff0c\u7a7f\u884c\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f9d\u7167\u81ea\u8eab\u6cd5\u5219\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u89c4\u8303\u8fd0\u884c\u800c\u53c8\u6620\u5c04\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u4fd7\u4e16\u3002\n\n\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bb2\u8ff0\u7231\u60c5\u3001\u4fa0\u4e49\u3001\u53cb\u60c5\u548c\u5b5d\u9053\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u91cc\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u8bf8\u591a\u4eba\u7269\u5e76\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff0c\u6709\u7740\u9519\u7efc\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5f80\u4e8b\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ea\u8ba9\u4ed6\u4eec\u66f4\u4e3a\u52a8\u4eba\u3002", "MILAN \u2014 Nine members of two families were killed in the same house in Sicily when the torrential rains and high winds that have been lashing Italy caused a river to burst its banks Saturday night.\n\nIn just moments, rushing water filled the villa where the families were staying, drowning those inside.\n\nA father and his daughter escaped harm because they had left the house to do some shopping.

And his language has been picked up by a number of leaders in other countries to offer justification of their own actions and to promote like-minded policies.\n\nSome leaders \u2014 or leaders of national institutions \u2014 have used similar language to go after political opponents, push their own populist agendas or even shield themselves from criticism of human rights abuses or the erosion of democratic norms.\n\nThe latest example came on Friday, when the Nigerian army cited remarks by Mr. Trump to defend its owns actions after fatally shooting unarmed protesters.", "All of which places Mr. Swan at a sticky nexus of journalistic ethics and best practices in an era when the audience for White House reporting has never been bigger \u2014 and the judgments never harsher. Ratings and subscriptions are up, and reporters become household names, but they are often denounced as \u201cfake news\u201d by the right and as brown-nosers by the left.\n\n\u201cHow do you practice insider journalism with an administration that a large share of the country is rooting for, regardless of the truth of the president\u2019s claims, and that another large part thinks is morally repugnant?\u201d said Ben Smith, editor in chief of BuzzFeed News (and a former employee of Mr. VandeHei\u2019s). \u201cThat is a really hard challenge.\u201d\n\nFor all the slings and arrows sent his way, Mr. Swan, who declined to comment for this article in the wake of last week\u2019s dust-up, has lived his own American dream.\n\nThe son of Norman Swan, a prominent television journalist in Australia, he arrived here in 2014 after a promising career in the Canberra trenches, where among other scoops he discovered video of an Australian senator hurling the feces of a kangaroo.\n\nOn a visa for a congressional fellowship, he spent nearly a year being rejected for reporting positions until landing a job at The Hill. \u201cI probably interviewed five or six hundred people in my life, and I just knew right away that he was going to be a great reporter,\u201d said Bob Cusack, the editor in chief.\n\nSources and competitors of Mr. Swan, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because, well, it\u2019s Washington, described a hustler and charmer with a herculean work ethic, often squeezing in four source meetings a day. \u201cHe seemed drawn to me,\u201d recalled Ms. Quinn, who met him at an Axios party at Nobu. \u201cHe asked me to dinner.\u201d", "Since President Trump\u2019s election, his loyalists online have provided him with a steady stream of provocative posts and shareable memes, often filtered up from platforms like Reddit through media channels like Fox News. In return, Mr. Trump has championed many of their messages as his own, amplifying them back to his larger base.\n\nThis feedback loop is how #JobsNotMobs came to be. In less than two weeks, the three-word phrase expanded from corners of the right-wing internet onto some of the most prominent political stages in the country, days before the midterm elections.\n\nOn Oct. 11, a video went viral on Twitter. The clip alternated between footage of angry protesters and clips of cable news anchors discouraging the use of the word \u201cmobs\u201d to describe those activists. The \u201cmob\u201d depiction is rooted in the right-wing talking point that Republicans are the rational alternatives to violent left-wing protesters, like the so-called anti-fascists who clashed with far-right groups last year. Soon after the \u201csupercut\u201d video went viral, the phrase \u201cjobs not mobs\u201d began gaining momentum. The \u201cjobs\u201d part of the phrase refers to the record low unemployment and job growth in the United States, for which Mr. Trump has taken credit. Scott Adams, the creator of the \u201cDilbert\u201d cartoon strip, quickly endorsed \u201cjobs not mobs\u201d as a potential slogan. Because of the cartoonist\u2019s popularity among the pro-Trump crowd online, this was a key moment. A screenshot of Mr. Adams\u2019s tweet was posted to Reddit, followed by a meme with the phrase laid over an image of factory workers at the top and a violent protest at the bottom. \u201cThis meme can go far,\u201d one Reddit user wrote. The creator of the meme, who goes by the pen name \u201cBryan Machiavelli,\u201d told The New York Times he charges $200 an hour for his \u201cmemetic warfare consulting\u201d services. Users on Reddit and Twitter continued to push the slogan, as popular pages on Facebook began to pick it up. The transfer of a message across social networks is one way a meme like this becomes amplified.\n\nOver the following days, #JobsNotMobs was used in reference to everyone from liberal protesters to Central American migrants trying to come into the United States.\n\nThe phrase was pushed by a series of increasingly prominent conservatives who have often railed against anti-fascist protesters. James Woods, the actor, tweeted it on Oct. 13. The next day, Charlie Kirk, a pro-Trump activist with a large internet following, sent it out. Women for Trump Movement, a Facebook page, wrote about it in a post that was shared 1,200 times.\n\nConservative media outlets routinely pick up stories that are gaining traction on the pro-Trump internet, and #JobsNotMobs was no exception. On Oct. 15, \u201cFox & Friends\u201d aired a segment on the phrase, saying: \u201cThe Trump administration is focusing on what Americans really care about. Not mobs, but jobs!\u201d\n\nSoon, Republicans around the country were racing to feature #JobsNotMobs in campaign materials.", "\u2022 U.S. election nears.\n\nThe tumultuous 2018 midterm campaign barreled through its final weekend and toward the day of decision, Tuesday.\n\nThe most prominent campaigners are on opposite sides of the country\u2019s vast political divide. President Trump has been crisscrossing the country to deliver fear-based messages on immigration and other issues. Former President Barack Obama has been assailing him in a surprisingly sharp, systematic way.\n\nOur live polling has many races too close to call, but there\u2019s a consensus in both parties that Democrats could take control of the House \u2014 and that the outlook for the Senate is unclear.", "The White House press office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nRight-wing extremists \u2014 a catchall category for a messy constellation of neo-Nazis, white nationalists, crypto-fascists, nihilists and attention-seeking trolls \u2014 vary widely in style and ideology. Some congregate out in the open, on forums like 4chan and Reddit as well as public platforms like Gab, the Twitter-like social network used by the suspect in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. Others communicate in private channels on Discord, a chat platform, or over encrypted messaging apps like Telegram or Wire. Some are ardent supporters of Mr. Trump, while others oppose him on the grounds that he is not extreme enough.\n\nWhat they have in common is a feeling of empowerment \u2014 a sense that the boundaries of acceptable speech are widening in the Trump era, and a suspicion that when they talk, Mr. Trump, or those with access to him, may be listening.\n\nEven small phrases can set off speculation. Last month, when Mr. Trump tweeted an unfounded accusation that left-wing protesters outside the confirmation hearings for Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh were \u201cpaid for by Soros and others,\u201d some extremists took it as evidence that the president shared their view of a global Jewish-led conspiracy led by Mr. Soros, a leading donor to many liberal causes.\n\n\u201cTrump has officially named the Jew,\u201d wrote one user on 4chan. \u201cTrump knows,\u201d wrote another, who said that the \u201cothers\u201d Mr. Trump referred to in his tweet might be a sly reference to other shadowy Jewish benefactors.\n\nThese extremists\u2019 sense of influence is almost certainly exaggerated. Mr. Trump, who has Jewish family members including his daughter, has said nothing about Mr. Soros\u2019s religion or a larger Jewish conspiracy. And it is unlikely that the president, who has said that he does not use a computer, is wading through obscure message boards in search of talking points.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped those extremists from interpreting his words as a signal that the president shares their views.\n\nIt is difficult to quantify how many right-wing extremists exist in America \u2014 many operate anonymously or pseudonymously online, and few real-world gatherings take place. But some private channels for neo-Nazis and other extremist groups have thousands of members, and more mainstream right-wing spaces \u2014 such as a pro-Trump Reddit forum, r/the_donald, which has more than 600,000 members \u2014 have amplified extremist messages.", "My dentist, a registered Republican, did not vote in the last midterm elections, in 2014.\n\nBut the owner of my local bookstore, a registered Democrat, did vote then. So did my accountant, who is not registered with either party.\n\nI know these details not because the dentist, the bookseller and the accountant volunteered to share their voting histories with me.

His only minor brushes with scandal came in 2006, when he left his wife to live with a male interior decorator, and in 2012, while serving as energy minister, when he made the tabloids for using a microwave at Parliament to warm a cushion for his pet dachshund, Otto.\n\nLord Barker\u2019s appointment, the company declared, was proof of its \u201ccommitment to the best standard of corporate governance.\u201d His allies say his efforts since then have been focused on what is best for the company \u2014 its employees and all of its shareholders \u2014 rather than on Mr. Deripaska\u2019s personal benefit.\n\nOthers saw Lord Barker\u2019s appointment as chairman of EN+ as proof of a phenomenon known as \u201cLords on Boards,\u201d a long line of eminent Britons willing to lend their names and connections to Russia\u2019s scandal-singed elite.\n\nBefore entering politics in the early 2000s, Lord Barker had worked in Moscow as the head of investor relations for Sibneft, a Russian oil company connected to two Russian oligarchs, Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich, a onetime business partner of Mr. Deripaska\u2019s. Lord Barker\u2019s job was to persuade often skeptical investors and financial journalists that Sibneft had shaken off its shady past in rigged privatization deals and broken with the habits of its oligarch founders.\n\nNow, Lord Barker assumed the chairmanship of EN+ and the London listing was a success. Mr. Deripaska, with his family, took around $1.5 billion from the stock sale and was able to repay VTB.\n\nThen in April came the sanctions announcement from Washington, which Mr. Deripaska described in a statement as \u201cgroundless, ridiculous and absurd.\u201d The world\u2019s aluminum market shook, as shares of EN+ went into a nosedive on the London exchange, where the company quickly lost more than half of its value.\n\nThe sanctions, which punish third parties that do business with designated companies and individuals, led to a mass exodus of his advisers. In London, Mr. Rudd\u2019s public relations company bailed, as did the consultancy business run by Lord Mandelson. Citigroup and Credit Suisse, which EN+ named in January as \u201cjoint corporate brokers\u201d and which earlier had worked on the company\u2019s public offering along with other banks, swiftly severed relations. In Washington, Mr. Waldman terminated his representation of Mr. Deripaska and Rusal.", "\u2022 Candidates are making a final pitch to voters across the United States.\n\nATLANTA \u2014 For weeks, Brian Kemp, the Georgia secretary of state and Republican candidate for governor, has faced accusations that he is trying to suppress the minority vote in his race against Stacey Abrams. And just days ago, a federal judge ruled that the state needed to adjust elements of its so-called \u201cexact match\u201d voting requirement, calling them needlessly burdensome.\n\nNow, in what Democrats said was a desperate attempt to deflect attention just two days before a crucial midterm election, Mr. Kemp used his official position Sunday to announce, with scant evidence, that the Democrats were under investigation for allegedly trying to hack the state\u2019s voter registration files.\n\nDemocrats immediately denounced the claim as bogus and called it an abuse of power.\n\nThe controversy over voting rights, and the basic mechanics of Georgia\u2019s electoral process, has roiled one of the nation\u2019s marquee races. Mr. Kemp is locked in a tight contest with Ms. Abrams, the Democratic nominee, who would become the first African-American woman to lead any state if she wins.

It is another of the super-tight California contests.\n\nAsians now make up about 22 percent of the district\u2019s population, and Ms. Kim has relied heavily on her biography: Her parents left Korea in the 1940s and raised her in Guam and Hawaii, where she often served as their translator.\n\n\u201cMost Democrats don\u2019t know what to make of me,\u201d she said. \u201cI am a different kind of Republican \u2014 I am an immigrant.

Because of strong currents, he didn\u2019t make it to the shore, he said, which prompted him to take on an even more demanding aquatic challenge.\n\n\u201cThe adventurer in me had unfinished business,\u201d he said after the Caribbean exercise.\n\nAfter he returned to Britain, he asked the Royal Marines if he could be allowed to swim for 48 hours straight, \u201cjust to see what I\u2019ve got in the locker,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the marines mentioned the idea of swimming around the entirety of Britain \u2014 something that\u2019s never been done before, And I thought, \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next after five months of swimming?\n\nMr. Edgley said that his plans involved something much more practical.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to learn to walk again,\u201d he said.", "With record numbers of women on the ballot this year, 12 women discussed their motivations to help other women get elected.\n\nBy Alyssa Schukar and Kate Zernike Produced by Tanner Curtis\n\nSome object to calling this \"The Year of the Woman\" \u2014 why should women get only one year?\n\nStill, there must be some way to recognize the records women have broken in American politics in 2018.

And there are more women behind the scenes, too: campaign managers, fund-raisers and volunteers.\n\nThe New York Times talked to some of these women who are working behind the candidates to change the face of American politics.\n\nSome say the events and upheavals of the last two years \u2014 the loss by the first woman to be a major party presidential nominee, the women's marches, more school shootings and the Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh \u2014 made them realize that to have a voice, they have to get involved. Others say it's time for a woman's perspective in leadership.\n\nAnd many were simply inspired by the women running, and the potential for so many firsts this year.

He also said he knew of no talks with the White House about the matter.\n\nBut that story has since unraveled.\n\nInternal government documents produced in the principal lawsuit on the issue, in New York, show Mr. Ross pressured the Justice Department to request the citizenship question, not the other way around.

After Mr. Bannon requested that Mr. Ross \u201ctalk to someone about the census,\u201d Mr. Ross met with Kris Kobach, a fierce immigration opponent whom President Trump had appointed to a panel on voter fraud.\n\nThe federal judge in the main lawsuit ordered Mr. Ross to testify under oath, stating that \u201chis intent and credibility are directly at issue,\u201d but last month the Supreme Court at least temporarily blocked the testimony. Another deposition of a senior Justice Department official who worked with Mr. Ross on the question went ahead as scheduled.\n\nThe lawsuit, which goes to trial on Monday, could have profound ramifications. Census figures determine not only where hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds are spent, but how the House of Representatives \u2014 and by extension, the Electoral College \u2014 and other political districts are remapped every decade to reflect population changes. Because immigrants and minorities disproportionately vote Democratic, a depressed head count could also expand Republican Party control when new political boundaries are drawn in 2021.\n\nWhile Mr. Ross has insisted that there is no clear evidence that the citizenship question would deter people from filling out census forms, the Census Bureau\u2019s own researchers repeatedly have found just that. In a memo last fall and in summaries of focus groups this spring, they noted that a wide range of ethnic minorities had voiced fears that the government would use citizenship information to persecute or even deport them \u2014 and one group with Vietnamese heritage even abandoned a focus group after learning that the next census would ask about citizenship.", "\u2022 If Democrats manage to lose just the Heitkamp seat, they have a (remote) chance of winning the Senate.

Or not.\n\nWhen North Carolina\u2019s Republican legislature ordered all early-voting sites to stay open 12 hours a day for 18 days this year, they called it a move to boost voting.\n\nIt\u2019s not turning out that way.\n\nMany poorer counties don\u2019t have the resources to comply, and more than half \u2014 including many rural, disproportionately minority ones \u2014 have had to close some early-voting sites\n\nSprawling Halifax County, 700 square miles and 52 percent African-American, closed two of its three early-voting sites. Now a drive to cast a ballot is as long as 20 miles. It had cost about $6,000 to open the sites for the last week of early voting in 2014. The new policy raised that to nearly $48,000, \u201cwhich didn\u2019t include overtime,\u201d said David Hines, the county election board chairman.\n\n[In Tuesday\u2019s election, the right to vote is still at issue.]\n\nThis was not the first such effort. In 2016, a federal appeals court struck down another legislative early-voting measure, saying it targeted \u201cAfrican-Americans with almost surgical precision.\u201d Many counties saw no need for the latest requirement, since they had been operating more sites for fewer hours or fewer days to affordably meet the needs of their voters.", "On Saturday, Maryland looked like a football team suffering under the weight of the previous week. It looked like a football team whose head coach had been reinstated, led a day of practices, and then been fired, all within 24 hours. It looked like a team whose players were compelled to spend the week ensuring some measure of justice for their dead friend and teammate.\n\nMichigan State scored on its first two drives of the game and went ahead, 10-0, on its way to an easy 24-3 victory. Maryland gained only 8 yards in the first quarter and 100 in the game. Its standout player was punter Wade Lees, who averaged 45 yards on eight punts. But as more evidence of the program\u2019s rough stretch, he had been involved in a scuffle involving teammates after practice during the week that resulted in a call to the police.\n\nMaryland\u2019s last, best chance at a victory on Saturday came with 11 minutes left in the fourth quarter, down, 17-3. Maryland defensive lineman Byron Cowart intercepted Rocky Lombardi\u2019s pass and was rumbling toward a touchdown, but just before the end zone, the ball was chopped out of his arms for a touchback.\n\nOn the next play, Michigan State scored on an 80-yard run.\n\n\u201cWe are right there playing one of the top programs in the nation, certainly one of the top programs in our league, and we\u2019re that far away from it being 17-10,\u201d Maryland\u2019s interim head coach, Matt Canada, said after the game.\n\nCanada blamed himself for the loss, repeatedly saying he needed to coach better, and acknowledged it had been a tough week. \u201cThis week was a challenging week,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a fact. You guys all know that.\u201d", "For Mr. Johnson, an independent, getting to other polling sites is difficult.

Colorado, Washington and Oregon now allow all voters to cast ballots by mail, while 37 states and the District of Columbia let voters cast ballots early. Florida voters will decide next week whether to end the disenfranchisement of felons, while 23 states have already loosened similar policies. Six million Americans with felony convictions still cannot cast ballots.\n\nSome experts say that even intentional suppression, while contrary to democratic elections, is not likely to have a huge impact on vote totals.\n\n\u201cThe estimates you get are that these sorts of changes might reduce turnout by a percentage point or two,\u201d said Charles Stewart III, an expert on election administration at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nBut with dozens of congressional and governor\u2019s races now within the margin of polling error, a point or two could easily decide many races \u2014 with control of Congress at stake.", "DOHA, Qatar \u2014 Simone Biles returned to training last November wondering if she could ever return to the form that made her an Olympic champion.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have to wonder anymore.

The department wanted Walmart to pay penalties of about $600 million, according to people with knowledge of the meeting. A guilty plea was on the table for the company or one of its subsidiaries, and the S.E.C. was pushing for a steep punishment as well.\n\nWalmart bristled, and as the election came and went, the two sides continued to negotiate, leading Walmart to receive more favorable terms from the Justice Department. But at the tail end of the Obama administration, it became increasingly difficult to get Walmart\u2019s lawyers to schedule meetings, according to two people with knowledge of the negotiations, who spoke about the private discussions on the condition of anonymity.\n\nWalmart had reason to hope that the Trump administration might have a more open mind. After the Walmart bribery scandal first came to light in an investigation published in The Times in 2012, Mr. Trump, then a real estate mogul with international holdings, said on CNBC that it was unfair to expect a company like Walmart not to engage in bribery when doing business overseas. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, he said, was a \u201chorrible law, and it should be changed.\u201d\n\nA person briefed on the matter said that negotiations gained steam in the early months of the Trump administration. Although Walmart was negotiating with the same career officials as it had during the Obama administration, the company closed in on a more favorable deal. Negotiations stalled again, and to date, the case against Walmart has not been resolved, though an announcement could come soon, the person briefed said. The company has said publicly that it set aside $283 million to cover potential settlements.\n\nA Walmart spokesman said the company was \u201ccontinuing discussions with the government agencies as we work to reach a solution.\u201d Mr. Stafford, the Justice Department spokesman, objected to The Times\u2019s account of the negotiations, without specifying what the department disputed.\n\nAs part of the analyses of enforcement activity under Mr. Trump, The Times asked Duke Law School and the Legal Data Lab at the University of Virginia School of Law to analyze corporate criminal prosecutions at the Justice Department, which they track.", "A number of the applicants were signed up by the New Georgia Project, a voter-drive group that Ms. Abrams founded to boost minority participation in the electoral process. Mr. Kemp has blamed the group for turning in sloppy paper applications.\n\nSome observers said they are worried that the \u201cpending\u201d status of these voters will lead to confusion when they go to the polls. In Friday\u2019s ruling, United States District Judge Eleanor L. Ross said that Mr. Oren, after learning he was on the pending list, went through \u201ca burdensome process requiring two trips to the polls, his own research and his hunting down a name and telephone number to give to election officials so that his citizenship status could be verified, all after he had already submitted proof of citizenship with his voter application.\u201d \u2019\n\nMr. Oren\u2019s ability to vote was held up by Fulton County poll workers who struggled to reach someone who could change his status from pending to active when he showed up with his proof of citizenship. The judge\u2019s order on Friday broadened the list of poll workers authorized to verify citizenship documents, and directed Mr. Kemp\u2019s office to issue a news release and update its website to clarify how such residents may vote.\n\nPurging inactive voters\n\nAccording to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, Georgia, under Mr. Kemp, purged 1.5 million voters from its rolls between 2012 and 2016. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that an additional 665,000 Georgia voters were purged last year.\n\nThe state is one of a handful that removes voters from the rolls after they are deemed \u201cinactive.\u201d Such removals were upheld in June by the United States Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision that considered a similar program in Ohio.\n\nSupporters of the purges say their intent, much like the \u201cexact match\u201d law, is to prevent fraud. But the policies remain highly controversial.", "Finally, there are the millions of eligible voters who are their own worst enemies. They may be unhappy with the choices before them or unconvinced that their votes will make a difference. Either way, they sit out Election Day, nursing their grudges and telling themselves that they\u2019re making a political statement. Wrong.\n\nWhether or not the cynics believe it, every vote really can make a difference. An election in 2017 for a legislative seat in Newport News, Va. \u2014 a seat that happened to determine control of the state\u2019s House of Delegates \u2014 was effectively decided by a single vote, out of more than 23,000 cast.\n\nOr take an even more consequential example: In the 2014 midterm elections, barely more than one in three eligible voters turned out; 143 million others stayed home. It was the worst showing in 70 years, and one of the weakest midterm turnouts in United States history. The only people celebrating were Republicans, because smaller electorates tend to be more conservative ones. The abysmal turnout in 2014 followed that pattern, and it allowed Republicans to seize control of the Senate. That gave Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, the power to shift the Supreme Court to the hard right for at least a generation.\n\nStill think voting doesn\u2019t matter?\n\nThis message is especially important for young people like Mr. Hagezom, who lean strongly Democratic and yet are notoriously bad about showing up to the polls. In 2014, the turnout rate for voters under age 30 was less than 20 percent. This year\u2019s numbers, so far, are looking much better, and they will very likely remain high in 2020, when President Trump will be on the ballot. But beyond that, the struggle to keep young voters politically engaged will continue.\n\nNo matter who wins, higher turnout is a good thing. It reaffirms the essence of the democratic process, and it tends to help candidates who are both more reasonable and more representative of the public at large.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that when more people vote, the electorate becomes more liberal. If Americans voted in proportion to their actual numbers, a majority would most likely support a vision for the country far different from that of Mr. Trump and the Republicans in Congress. This includes broader access to health care, higher taxes on the wealthy, more aggressive action against climate change and more racial equality in the criminal justice system.\n\nRepublicans are aware of this, which is why the party has gone to such lengths to drive down turnout among Democratic-leaning groups. A recent example: In North Dakota, the Republican-led Legislature changed the law to make it harder for Native Americans to cast a ballot.\n\nIt comes down to this: Democracy isn\u2019t self-activating. It depends on citizens getting involved and making themselves heard. So if you haven\u2019t yet cast a ballot, get out and do it on Tuesday, or earlier if your state allows early voting. Help your family, friends and neighbors do the same. Help a stranger. Vote as if the future of the country depends on it. Because it does.\n\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.", "A second methodology measured only cases that were simultaneously announced and settled, meaning the Obama totals did not include cases that were challenged by defendants and settled later under Mr. Trump.\n\nFor another approach, Urska Velikonja, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center who has compiled many years of S.E.C. penalty data, replicated, as close as possible, the S.E.C.\u2019s approach to measuring enforcement. This approach is based on when cases were settled, not when they were filed, and also includes money paid to government agencies other than the S.E.C., including overseas.\n\nThe S.E.C. rejected The Times\u2019s approach, saying it would have been more appropriate to have compared the first 20 months of the Trump administration with either the first 20 months of the Obama era or the second Obama term. That comparison would show more cases filed under the Trump period, the agency said.\n\nThe Times focused on penalties, not case totals, however. And it did not look at the first months of the Obama administration because the agency was in turmoil after the financial crisis, whereas the final months represented the agency Mr. Trump was inheriting.\n\nTo peruse the Times case data, click here.\n\nThe Justice Department\n\nThe Times asked the Legal Data Lab at the University of Virginia School of Law and Duke Law School, which maintains a registry of corporate criminal prosecutions, to analyze all such cases filed in the first 20 months of the Trump administration and compare them with those filed in the first and last 20 months of the Obama White House. The analysis reflects sums paid to federal prosecutions, whether in fines, restitution or forfeiture. It does not reflect sums paid to civil regulators or state or foreign enforcers.\n\nThe Times also analyzed civil fraud actions against financial institutions, based on a list of such cases that the law firm Buckley Sandler compiled from public announcements. The Justice Department has two primary methods for pursuing such cases, which require a lower burden of proof than criminal cases: the False Claims Act and the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act.\n\nOther Agencies\n\nAnalysis of enforcement activity by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission was based on data provided by the commission.\n\nPublic Citizen, a left-leaning oversight group, published a report in July that examined enforcement at other agencies. The report was based on data from the Corporate Research Project, a nonprofit group whose Violation Tracker records enforcement actions across the federal government.", "The lawyer for a Christian woman acquitted of blasphemy charges after spending eight years on death row in Pakistan has fled the country, fearing for his safety, her brother said Saturday.\n\nJames Masih said Asia Bibi\u2019s lawyer, Saiful Malook, left Pakistan, without providing further details.

In return, the Islamists halted their protests, which had blocked roads and brought life to a standstill in parts of the country.", "I love to bake. My favorite thing about fall is that I have an excuse to make my mom\u2019s towering apple cake again. So, I always thought, once my first child was in elementary school, I would delight in taking part in bake sale fund-raisers. This is my jam!\n\nInstead, I dread them.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not a monster. I\u2019m not opposed to kids going on field trips. I do not imagine that funds for soccer uniforms materialize out of thin air. So I dutifully show up to each bake sale with a tray of sugary, homemade kid bait. (Also, um , it would be awkward if the mom who is the author of two cookbooks and who runs a cooking website came empty-handed.)\n\nStill, bake sales trouble me.\n\nThey feel like a holdover from a time when many moms didn\u2019t work ( even in 2018, it\u2019s always the moms) and it was presumed they had loads of time to bake cookies for kids. That\u2019s what we imagined full-time child rearing entailed.\n\nBake sales can, unintentionally, perpetuate some deeply seated sexist stereotypes, the same ones that compel us to ask potential first ladies and female candidates for their favorite cookie recipe.

Eventually, death will separate them from me, and I have no idea how or when. None of us do. If we abide by objective time, we are temporary passengers on a bizarre machine that does not care about our driving urge to love the people we love longer than forever. It moves how it moves. Love feels eternal, yet we, in this bodily form, at least, are finite. It doesn\u2019t add up.\n\nBut here in Johor \u2014 12 or more hours ahead of the people I want to protect from death \u2014 I\u2019m disassociated from the threat of their permanent departure.

Conversely, when they\u2019re awake and animated, out in the dangerous world, sleep numbs my anxiety.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m ahead of the people I love in time.

Death can never catch up.\n\nThe other night over FaceTime, my 6-year-old nephew asked why it was dark where I was in Malaysia and light where he was in the United States. I said to imagine a giant flashlight shining down on earth. I told him it takes a day for our planet to rotate, a year to revolve. \u201cThe light can\u2019t touch everything at once,\u201d I said.\n\nI\u2019m well aware that my theory is a strategy, that in my attempt to shirk time and prevent death from robbing me of my loved ones, I am merely deceiving myself. And of course, I realize that all this does not protect my fianc\u00e9, here in the same time zone. I\u2019d protect him myself, but it\u2019s not easy when he\u2019s out in the Malaysian jungle shooting a movie, texting me that there are four men with shotguns and machetes to defend him and his crew from snakes, leopards and boars. He sends me a photo of a baby king cobra they caught, trapped in a water bottle, its eyes lidless, its mouth agape. Not today, snake, not today.\n\nI know there is no trick or tool that will shield anyone I love, not with my hands, nor with time\u2019s.

In the first, the last 21 months proceeded in exactly the same fashion \u2014 with the strongest economy since the 1990s, full employment almost nigh, ISIS defeated, no new overseas wars or major terrorist attacks \u2014 except that Donald Trump let his staffers dictate his Twitter feed, avoided the press except to tout good economic news, eschewed cruelties and insults and weird behavior around Vladimir Putin, and found a way to make his White House a no-drama zone.\n\nIn this scenario it\u2019s hard to imagine that Trump\u2019s approval ratings wouldn\u2019t have floated up into the high 40s; they float up into the mid-40s as it is whenever he manages to shut up. Even with their threadbare and unpopular policy agenda, Republicans would be favored to keep the House and maintain their state-legislature advantages. All the structural impediments to a Democratic recovery would loom much larger, Trump\u2019s re-election would be more likely than not, and his opposition would be stuck waiting for a recession to have any chance of coming back.\n\nThen consider a second counterfactual. Imagine that instead of just containing himself and behaving like a generic Republican, Trump had actually followed through on the populism that he promised in 2016, dragging his party toward the economic center and ditching the G.O.P.\u2019s most unpopular ideas. Imagine that he followed through on Steve Bannon\u2019s boasts about a big infrastructure bill instead of trying for Obamacare repeal; imagine that he listened to Marco Rubio and his daughter and tilted his tax cut more toward middle-class families; imagine that he spent more time bullying Silicon Valley into inshoring factory jobs than whining about Fake News; imagine that he made lower Medicare drug prices a signature issue rather than a last-minute pre-election gambit.\n\nThis strategy could have easily cut the knees out from under the Democrats\u2019 strongest appeal, their more middle-class-friendly economic agenda, and highlighted their biggest liability, which is the way the party\u2019s base is pulling liberalism way left of the middle on issues of race and culture and identity. It would have given Trump a chance to expand his support among minorities while holding working-class whites, and to claim the kind of decisive power that many nationalist leaders around the world enjoy. It would have threatened liberalism not just with more years out of power, but outright irrelevance under long-term right-of-center rule.", "By Damon Winter Mr. Winter is a staff photographer currently on assignment for Opinion.\n\nOver the past few years I have wondered on many occasions whether our work matters. When I traveled to Pittsburgh to cover the aftermath of the horrific mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue, I spent time with a friend and fellow photojournalist, a Pittsburgh native who recalled covering nearly 20 mass shootings, some not far from home. Although shocked, he seemed to accept that it was only a matter of time before it happened in his own back yard.\n\nIn the days to come, we would see and make images that have become all too familiar, scenes that could as easily be from Parkland, Orlando, Las Vegas, Newtown, Aurora, Columbine, places whose names have become shorthand for the tragedies that have befallen them.\n\nWhat does it feel like to be touched by such brutality? Every life lost, every loved one taken away is an ocean of pain on a scale that can never truly be conveyed. But time after time, we go through the motions. As a nation, we experience these tragedies largely from a distance, through imagery several degrees removed from the ugly truth. The horror is unimaginable, but the images that follow are often achingly beautiful. They depict intense suffering and genuine grief, but they also make it easier for us to swallow and over time we become numb. They give cover to politicians who offer thoughts and prayers and then do nothing.\n\nIn 1955, Mamie Till-Bradley demanded that we look evil squarely in the face by insisting that the swollen, battered body of her 14-year-old son, Emmett Till, be photographed. \u201cLet the people see what I\u2019ve seen,\u201d she told the funeral director, insisting on an open-coffin funeral.

Nope! This casserole mostly contains just potatoes, which are unfortunately useless in the attempt to time travel, except, of course, when used to defend oneself from baffled torch-wielding serfs in 15th-century France.

Many people, of course, favor the groups they belong to and dislike groups they don\u2019t belong to; that is the regrettable foundation of prejudice. But not all groups are disliked the same way: Why are some groups (such as homeless people) dismissed or neglected in a relatively steady stream of scorn, while other groups (such as Jewish people) are subjected to sudden waves of virulent, even exterminatory attacks?\n\nFor many decades psychologists conceived of prejudice as a one-dimensional antipathy: People love their \u201cin-groups\u201d and hate \u201cout-groups.\u201d But this us-versus-them approach failed to account for prejudice\u2019s real-world complexities.\n\nTo better understand the various ways in which bigotry manifests, the psychologists Susan Fiske, Peter Glick and I developed a new theory of prejudice, one that focuses on the content of stereotypes of out-groups.

I followed the green one to a seating area from which I could see the rest of the people in the room, the visitors and the other-visas, make their way to the interview booths.

During Johnson\u2019s tenure, Nate Snyder says, his office received calls from evangelical pastors worried about far-right recruitment in their congregations. There was also concern about reports of white supremacy in the military.\n\nJohnson, who told me that fear of another ISIS-style attack kept him up at night, held regular round tables with imams and other members of the Islamic community. He resisted the pressure from some members of his staff, and some in Congress, like Thompson, to make similar overtures to communities concerned about antigovernment or white-supremacist groups. He thought it would be absurd to hold round tables with sovereign citizens and white supremacists. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that would have been a very effective use of my time to try,\u201d he told me.\n\nJohnson never called Dylann Roof a domestic terrorist, a phrase commonly applied to Timothy McVeigh. \u201cIf there was ever an opportunity to define white extremists as domestic terrorists, Dylann Roof was it,\u201d Snyder says. \u201cBut people went back and forth, and it went down the same careful deliberation that happens with active shooters: Maybe it was a mental-health issue. Maybe he was \u2018disturbed.\u2019 Maybe he had a predisposition to violence.\u201d\n\nWhen I spoke to Johnson, he felt it was not his place to call Roof a terrorist. There isn\u2019t a crime of \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d to charge someone with. \u201cThere is a certain type of violent extremism that is by nature more of a matter for law enforcement, and another that is about engaging communities at the local level,\u201d he said. But the country\u2019s chief law-enforcement official at the time, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, also didn\u2019t call Roof a terrorist \u2014 though she did note that his mass shooting, which she was prosecuting as a hate crime, seemed to meet the definition of terrorism. \u201cHate crimes are the original domestic terrorism,\u201d she said. James Comey, then director of the F.B.I., wasn\u2019t sure. Terrorism, he stated in June 2015, was \u201cmore of a political act,\u201d and he didn\u2019t see the Charleston shooting as political. Even after a racist manifesto Roof penned surfaced online stating his intent to \u201cprotect the white race\u201d by instigating a race war, Comey still wasn\u2019t sure it met the definition. \u201cI only operate in a legal framework,\u201d he told HuffPost.\n\nThe refusal to name the attack as \u201cterrorism\u201d was, in some critics\u2019 eyes, a crucial misstep that would have far broader implications. \u201cI was very pleased when the Obama administration started and said, We\u2019re not going to use the phrase \u2018war on terror,\u2019 \u201d says Erroll Southers, a former F.B.I. agent and now director of the Safe Communities Institute at the University of Southern California. \u201cI think the Obama people decided, O.K., we\u2019re not going to call it \u2018terrorism,\u2019 thinking it was a good thing. The problem was they didn\u2019t realize how much it emboldened the other side and gave them political cover.\u201d\n\nIn the months following Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, security analysts noted with increasing alarm what seemed to be a systematic erosion of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s analytic and operational capabilities with regard to countering violent extremism. It began with the appointment of a new national-security team. Like their counterparts now running immigration policy, the team came from the fringe of conservative politics, some of them with connections to Islamophobic think tanks and organizations like ACT for America or the Center for Security Policy, whose founder, Frank Gaffney, was Washington\u2019s most prominent peddler of anti-Muslim conspiracy theories.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition to Gaffney, whose biased and statistically flawed data on the \u201cMuslim threat\u201d became the premise for Trump\u2019s so-called Muslim ban, there were other ideological fellow travelers like Sebastian and Katharine Gorka, the husband-and-wife national-security team. Sebastian Gorka became a senior White House adviser, and Katharine Gorka became a senior adviser to the Department of Homeland Security. During the transition, Sebastian Gorka predicted the demise of \u201cC.V.E.,\u201d which he suggested was a fuzzy, politically correct approach to a problem \u2014 terrorism \u2014 that needed a better fix. Shortly afterward, Katharine Gorka, who once criticized the Obama administration for \u201callowing Islamists to dictate national-security policy,\u201d made it clear, Nate Snyder recalls, that she didn\u2019t like the phrase \u201ccountering violent extremism.\u201d From now on, the mission would be focused on \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d the White House\u2019s go-to phrase, which, as Sebastian Gorka later explained, was intended to \u201cjettison the political correctness of the last eight years.\u201d\n\nA surreal scene, replicated in nearly every department and agency, soon began to play out inside the Department of Homeland Security. George Selim, a longtime national-security expert in both the Bush and Obama administrations who headed the Office of Community Partnerships, which worked with local government and civic groups on C.V.E. efforts, noted that as the months passed, \u201cit was clear that there were fewer and fewer of the career civil servants at the table for critical policy decisions.\u201d Some political appointees seemed to have virtually no experience with the issues they had been tapped to advise on. Katharine Gorka, as her own LinkedIn biography notes, had never held a public-sector job before joining the department, nor did she seem to have any practical experience in national security, or law enforcement, or intelligence. Another new senior Homeland Security official, the retired Navy officer Frank Wuco, had made a career of lecturing to the military about the jihadi mind-set, often while role-playing as a member of the Taliban in a Pashtun hat and kaffiyeh. \u201cThat\u2019s who was trying to tell me he understands the threat,\u201d an official said dryly.\n\nBy February 2017, after the Trump administration issued its first executive order trying to ban citizens of Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, several American Muslim groups decided to reject federal C.V.E. grant money they were awarded under the Obama administration out of concern over the new administration\u2019s framing of the issue. That March, the White House froze the $10 million the previous administration had allotted for the grants, pending review. While that review was underway, the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. issued a joint intelligence bulletin, dated May 10, warning that white supremacists might pose \u201ca threat of lethal violence\u201d over the next year. The report, which some analysts said reflected a fraction of the actual numbers, said that white supremacists \u201cwere responsible for 49 homicides in 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016 . . . more than any other domestic extremist movement.\u201d\n\nAt the end of June, the Department of Homeland Security withheld grant money from several previously approved applicants whose focus was on studying extremists\u2019 online networks and helping both white supremacists and Muslim extremists leave their movements. Though the total budget for C.V.E. was minuscule given the department\u2019s overall grant budget, rejecting those programs nonetheless produced \u201ca real chilling effect,\u201d as one policy analyst recalls. Some researchers withdrew from plans to brief lawmakers on far-right extremism.\n\nIn July 2017, Selim tendered his resignation. Not long afterward, a senior official on the interagency task force running C.V.E. efforts withdrew. More departures followed. The Department of Homeland Security renamed the Office of Community Partnerships the Office of Terrorism Prevention Partnerships. At the department\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis, analysts specifically looking at domestic terrorism and coordinating with local law enforcement were reassigned as public-affairs liaisons, Snyder says. \u201cSo no one is looking at the intelligence and connecting the dots, which is what the Department of Homeland Security was created to do.\u201d\n\nIn the lingo of the counterterrorism world, the department\u2019s responsibility is anything \u201cleft of boom,\u201d meaning all the pre-emptive steps that might prevent an attack, from securing the borders to synthesizing and sharing intelligence to working with community leaders and local law enforcement to help them better identify risks. Today, at least for the federal government, Snyder says \u201cleft of boom is dead.\u201d\n\nWilliam Fears was born in 1987 and spent his childhood in Jasper, Tex., a tiny and deeply segregated town about 130 miles northeast of Houston. East Texas is Klan country, and Jasper holds a notable spot in the racist history of the region as the town where, in 1998, when Fears was 10, three white men lynched a black man named James Byrd Jr., chaining him to the back of a truck and dragging him to death.\n\nEarly in his life, Fears, searching for identity, cycled through a long list of ideologies. He was 14 on Sept. 11, 2001, old enough to absorb the patriotic fervor of that moment but too young to enlist. For a year or two, he was a Michael Moore-style populist, having been \u201cred-pilled on \u2018Bowling for Columbine.\u2019 \u201d Then, having spent a great deal of his spare time stoned and watching YouTube, Fears embraced the Sept. 11 \u201ctruthers\u201d movement. As he spent more and more time on sites like Infowars, he was exposed to notions that the government, backed by the Illumi-nati, the globalists, the Freemasons \u2014 Jews, but not \u201cthe Jews\u201d as he would later come to see them \u2014 had blown up the towers, crashed the financial markets and plunged the country into economic crisis. This led to his next great obsession: the candidacy of the G.O.P. presidential hopeful Ron Paul, a libertarian who had amassed a large grass-roots following of what The New York Times then called \u201ciconoclastic white men.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Fears eventually grew bored with Paul, just as he had grown bored with Michael Moore, and it was in this state of vague political disillusionment, and heavy drug use, that Fears kidnapped a former girlfriend in 2009 and stabbed her in the face, legs and neck before she managed to escape. In 2010, he was sentenced to seven years in prison.\n\nFears doesn\u2019t like to talk much about his sojourn in the Texas state-prison system, though like many young men who went from the penitentiary to the far right, he was introduced to the basic tenets of white supremacy there. \u201cWhite guys got to stick together,\u201d he says, referring to an admitted friendship with members of the Texas branch of the Aryan Brotherhood, one of the most notoriously brutal white-supremacist gangs in the country. But he dropped those friendships after prison, he insists. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the whole Nazi skinhead thing with tattoos on their face and beating up minorities for no reason,\u201d he says, implying that they represented an earlier generation: \u201cThey\u2019re like 1.0s.\u201d\n\nSix years later, Fears was paroled and emerged from prison drug-free but otherwise largely the same. He was still a conspiracy theorist, though he was less obsessed with the government, his friend John Canales noticed when they reconnected that summer. \u201cNow it was all about the Jews,\u201d Canales says. At home in the Houston suburb of Pasadena, Fears submerged himself in what to him was the new, hyperconnected world of the internet, where every YouTube video he watched algorithmically directed him to others with increasingly far-right political agendas. He was fascinated by men like Richard Spencer, who fashioned himself as the second coming of George Lincoln Rockwell, the founder of the American Nazi Party. He was also intrigued by Donald Trump, the troubadour of a new generation of angry white men, the alt-right movement \u2014 white supremacy 2.0 \u2014 with its in-jokes and symbols that were mostly lost on U.S. law enforcement.\n\nFears believed in the power of memes, though alt-right memes, while dripping in irony, were also, in essence, hate speech, part of a propaganda war arguably intended to spread terror just as much as any ISIS execution video. Fears, his friend Canales says, was one of the first people Canales knew to understand this and promote the memes as broadly as he could, standing on street corners and \u201csieg heil-ing\u201d at passers-by or waving a swastika-laden Pepe the Frog sign reading \u201cFree Helicopter Rides,\u201d an allusion to the murder of political enemies, notably leftists.\n\nIn December 2016, less than six months after getting out of prison, Fears went to his first Richard Spencer event, on the campus of Texas A&M. More so-called free-speech events followed, where young white men in red MAGA hats and polo shirts descended upon college campuses or progressive enclaves in otherwise blood-red states: a clean-cut Trumpian army, marching in formation or hurling insults at activists who, outraged by their very presence, would try to fight them.\n\nSometimes the police would intervene, or not. Fears, for one, always felt safe with the police in Texas, though he said \u201cthey work for ZOG\u201d \u2014 the so-called Zionist Occupied Government. \u201cThey\u2019ll take their paycheck over the country.\u201d\n\nCops would stand watch at events, sometimes on horseback, and while they might not have been ideologically aligned with the alt-right, they still tolerated them. Fears said the cops were far less forgiving of Antifa, a catchall term that has been used to describe dedicated anti-fascists and so-called anarchist extremists, as well as animal rights activists, immigration rights activists, members of the local Socialist movement, environmental protesters like those who had recently been blasted by water cannons and rubber bullets at Standing Rock, and Black Lives Matter supporters, whose protests have been met by dozens of cops in riot gear, as well as sometimes members of a paramilitary support unit. One Houston activist, who went to high school with Fears, recalls a rally where the police posed for pictures with members of the alt-right. \u201cVery buddy-buddy,\u201d he says.\n\nThe same essential scenario played out across the country. At a rally in Sacramento in June 2016 organized by the white-supremacist Traditionalist Worker Party, a throng of counterprotesters showed up. \u201cThe police didn\u2019t step in really at all,\u201d a police observer and representative of the National Lawyers Guild later told The Sacramento Bee. \u201cThey basically just let people do what they wanted to do,\u201d the observer said. \u201cIn this case, someone made a decision just to let them fight it out.\u201d Ten people were hospitalized, at least five for stabbing wounds and other lacerations, most of them left-wing counterprotesters, some of whom were later charged with assault. Only one white supremacist was arrested, though court records originally acquired by The Guardian mentioned at least four T.W.P.-affiliated men who came armed with knives to the rally but were not charged. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at you as a victim,\u201d an investigator with the California Highway Patrol reportedly assured a member of the T.W.P. after the rally.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne domestic-terrorism expert who conducts hate-crimes training for law enforcement was baffled by the pushback she received from police officers who didn\u2019t seem to view white-supremacist groups as a law-enforcement problem. \u201cThey\u2019d say things like, \u2018Why aren\u2019t you calling Black Lives Matter or Antifa a hate group?\u2019 The answer is, because they\u2019re not hate groups! But they didn\u2019t see it that way.\u201d\n\nIt was in this atmosphere that Fears made his progress through various protests. He traveled to Charlottesville with a backpack of dystopian gear: goggles, gloves and a helmet, though he disguised himself as a Trump supporter in a suit. It was war. It was also fun. By the summer of 2017, the media had begun to cover more far-right events, leading more people to show up in protest, which furthered the right\u2019s victimization narrative, which in turn led to more events and more violence, all of which was packaged into neat selling points for a movement whose actual real-life followers may have been far fewer than they appeared.\n\nA person\u2019s willingness to brawl was a point of pride. Some of the most ardent fighters, many of them felons, became celebrities in their own right, offered speaking slots at rallies, where their V.I.P. status earned them police protection. The Rise Above Movement, led in part by a gang member who had gone to prison for an attack, turned beat-downs into an art form, which they promoted on YouTube, drawing recruits. Nathan Damigo, a former Marine who was incarcerated for five years for armed robbery, used footage of his punching a young woman in the face during a Berkeley protest as a recruiting video for his white-nationalist organization, Identity Evropa. The Proud Boys went as far as to create an entire culture around gang-style rituals, including initiation beatings.\n\nOn Facebook, various white men were stating their intention of going to Charlottesville for what they understood would be a huge gathering of the tribes, making plans of whom to meet up with and what to bring. Fears initially advised against carrying weapons, but he suggested keeping them close by. \u201cIt all comes down to police,\u201d he said on Facebook. \u201cIf they leave us to fight for ourselves like in Berkeley, we know to get ready for bricks to start flying.\u201d\n\nIn private communications on the chat service Discord, posted online by the progressive watchdog Unicorn Riot, organizers of Unite the Right spent weeks discussing tactics. The F.B.I. itself was limited in its surveillance capacity (though many left-wing groups argued that this did not prevent the bureau from monitoring their activities), and in the absence of comprehensive federal scrutiny, right-wing activists trawled through left-wing websites, shared photos of leading anti-fascist and racial-justice activists and infiltrated real-life gatherings. In advance of the event, leaked chats documented potential attendees openly advising their comrades to take note of any threats of violence so they could share them with the police. Erroll Southers later remarked on the sophistication of advising their followers not to bring cellphones, and sharing information among small cells of affinity groups: \u201cFrom an intelligence perspective, it was very impressive.\u201d", "In 2011, the White House described the threat of Al Qaeda and its affiliates as the \u201cpre-eminent security threat to our country.\u201d By 2013, a new threat had emerged: so-called homegrown violent extremists, or H.V.E.s, a category of people who, though born in the United States, were inspired by a nondomestic ideology to commit violence.

The report, which some analysts said reflected a fraction of the actual numbers, said that white supremacists \u201cwere responsible for 49 homicides in 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016 . . . more than any other domestic extremist movement.\u201d\n\nAt the end of June, the Department of Homeland Security withheld grant money from several previously approved applicants whose focus was on studying extremists\u2019 online networks and helping both white supremacists and Muslim extremists leave their movements. Though the total budget for C.V.E. was minuscule given the department\u2019s overall grant budget, rejecting those programs nonetheless produced \u201ca real chilling effect,\u201d as one policy analyst recalls. Some researchers withdrew from plans to brief lawmakers on far-right extremism.\n\nIn July 2017, Selim tendered his resignation. Not long afterward, a senior official on the interagency task force running C.V.E. efforts withdrew. More departures followed. The Department of Homeland Security renamed the Office of Community Partnerships the Office of Terrorism Prevention Partnerships. At the department\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis, analysts specifically looking at domestic terrorism and coordinating with local law enforcement were reassigned as public-affairs liaisons, Snyder says. \u201cSo no one is looking at the intelligence and connecting the dots, which is what the Department of Homeland Security was created to do.\u201d\n\nIn the lingo of the counterterrorism world, the department\u2019s responsibility is anything \u201cleft of boom,\u201d meaning all the pre-emptive steps that might prevent an attack, from securing the borders to synthesizing and sharing intelligence to working with community leaders and local law enforcement to help them better identify risks. Today, at least for the federal government, Snyder says \u201cleft of boom is dead.\u201d\n\nWilliam Fears was born in 1987 and spent his childhood in Jasper, Tex., a tiny and deeply segregated town about 130 miles northeast of Houston. East Texas is Klan country, and Jasper holds a notable spot in the racist history of the region as the town where, in 1998, when Fears was 10, three white men lynched a black man named James Byrd Jr., chaining him to the back of a truck and dragging him to death.\n\nEarly in his life, Fears, searching for identity, cycled through a long list of ideologies. He was 14 on Sept. 11, 2001, old enough to absorb the patriotic fervor of that moment but too young to enlist. For a year or two, he was a Michael Moore-style populist, having been \u201cred-pilled on \u2018Bowling for Columbine.\u2019 \u201d Then, having spent a great deal of his spare time stoned and watching YouTube, Fears embraced the Sept. 11 \u201ctruthers\u201d movement. As he spent more and more time on sites like Infowars, he was exposed to notions that the government, backed by the Illumi-nati, the globalists, the Freemasons \u2014 Jews, but not \u201cthe Jews\u201d as he would later come to see them \u2014 had blown up the towers, crashed the financial markets and plunged the country into economic crisis. This led to his next great obsession: the candidacy of the G.O.P. presidential hopeful Ron Paul, a libertarian who had amassed a large grass-roots following of what The New York Times then called \u201ciconoclastic white men.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Fears eventually grew bored with Paul, just as he had grown bored with Michael Moore, and it was in this state of vague political disillusionment, and heavy drug use, that Fears kidnapped a former girlfriend in 2009 and stabbed her in the face, legs and neck before she managed to escape. In 2010, he was sentenced to seven years in prison.\n\nFears doesn\u2019t like to talk much about his sojourn in the Texas state-prison system, though like many young men who went from the penitentiary to the far right, he was introduced to the basic tenets of white supremacy there. \u201cWhite guys got to stick together,\u201d he says, referring to an admitted friendship with members of the Texas branch of the Aryan Brotherhood, one of the most notoriously brutal white-supremacist gangs in the country. But he dropped those friendships after prison, he insists. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the whole Nazi skinhead thing with tattoos on their face and beating up minorities for no reason,\u201d he says, implying that they represented an earlier generation: \u201cThey\u2019re like 1.0s.\u201d\n\nSix years later, Fears was paroled and emerged from prison drug-free but otherwise largely the same. He was still a conspiracy theorist, though he was less obsessed with the government, his friend John Canales noticed when they reconnected that summer. \u201cNow it was all about the Jews,\u201d Canales says. At home in the Houston suburb of Pasadena, Fears submerged himself in what to him was the new, hyperconnected world of the internet, where every YouTube video he watched algorithmically directed him to others with increasingly far-right political agendas. He was fascinated by men like Richard Spencer, who fashioned himself as the second coming of George Lincoln Rockwell, the founder of the American Nazi Party. He was also intrigued by Donald Trump, the troubadour of a new generation of angry white men, the alt-right movement \u2014 white supremacy 2.0 \u2014 with its in-jokes and symbols that were mostly lost on U.S. law enforcement.\n\nFears believed in the power of memes, though alt-right memes, while dripping in irony, were also, in essence, hate speech, part of a propaganda war arguably intended to spread terror just as much as any ISIS execution video. Fears, his friend Canales says, was one of the first people Canales knew to understand this and promote the memes as broadly as he could, standing on street corners and \u201csieg heil-ing\u201d at passers-by or waving a swastika-laden Pepe the Frog sign reading \u201cFree Helicopter Rides,\u201d an allusion to the murder of political enemies, notably leftists.\n\nIn December 2016, less than six months after getting out of prison, Fears went to his first Richard Spencer event, on the campus of Texas A&M. More so-called free-speech events followed, where young white men in red MAGA hats and polo shirts descended upon college campuses or progressive enclaves in otherwise blood-red states: a clean-cut Trumpian army, marching in formation or hurling insults at activists who, outraged by their very presence, would try to fight them.\n\nSometimes the police would intervene, or not. Fears, for one, always felt safe with the police in Texas, though he said \u201cthey work for ZOG\u201d \u2014 the so-called Zionist Occupied Government. \u201cThey\u2019ll take their paycheck over the country.\u201d\n\nCops would stand watch at events, sometimes on horseback, and while they might not have been ideologically aligned with the alt-right, they still tolerated them. Fears said the cops were far less forgiving of Antifa, a catchall term that has been used to describe dedicated anti-fascists and so-called anarchist extremists, as well as animal rights activists, immigration rights activists, members of the local Socialist movement, environmental protesters like those who had recently been blasted by water cannons and rubber bullets at Standing Rock, and Black Lives Matter supporters, whose protests have been met by dozens of cops in riot gear, as well as sometimes members of a paramilitary support unit. One Houston activist, who went to high school with Fears, recalls a rally where the police posed for pictures with members of the alt-right. \u201cVery buddy-buddy,\u201d he says.\n\nThe same essential scenario played out across the country. At a rally in Sacramento in June 2016 organized by the white-supremacist Traditionalist Worker Party, a throng of counterprotesters showed up. \u201cThe police didn\u2019t step in really at all,\u201d a police observer and representative of the National Lawyers Guild later told The Sacramento Bee. \u201cThey basically just let people do what they wanted to do,\u201d the observer said. \u201cIn this case, someone made a decision just to let them fight it out.\u201d Ten people were hospitalized, at least five for stabbing wounds and other lacerations, most of them left-wing counterprotesters, some of whom were later charged with assault. Only one white supremacist was arrested, though court records originally acquired by The Guardian mentioned at least four T.W.P.-affiliated men who came armed with knives to the rally but were not charged. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at you as a victim,\u201d an investigator with the California Highway Patrol reportedly assured a member of the T.W.P. after the rally.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne domestic-terrorism expert who conducts hate-crimes training for law enforcement was baffled by the pushback she received from police officers who didn\u2019t seem to view white-supremacist groups as a law-enforcement problem. \u201cThey\u2019d say things like, \u2018Why aren\u2019t you calling Black Lives Matter or Antifa a hate group?\u2019 The answer is, because they\u2019re not hate groups! But they didn\u2019t see it that way.\u201d\n\nIt was in this atmosphere that Fears made his progress through various protests. He traveled to Charlottesville with a backpack of dystopian gear: goggles, gloves and a helmet, though he disguised himself as a Trump supporter in a suit. It was war. It was also fun. By the summer of 2017, the media had begun to cover more far-right events, leading more people to show up in protest, which furthered the right\u2019s victimization narrative, which in turn led to more events and more violence, all of which was packaged into neat selling points for a movement whose actual real-life followers may have been far fewer than they appeared.\n\nA person\u2019s willingness to brawl was a point of pride. Some of the most ardent fighters, many of them felons, became celebrities in their own right, offered speaking slots at rallies, where their V.I.P. status earned them police protection. The Rise Above Movement, led in part by a gang member who had gone to prison for an attack, turned beat-downs into an art form, which they promoted on YouTube, drawing recruits. Nathan Damigo, a former Marine who was incarcerated for five years for armed robbery, used footage of his punching a young woman in the face during a Berkeley protest as a recruiting video for his white-nationalist organization, Identity Evropa. The Proud Boys went as far as to create an entire culture around gang-style rituals, including initiation beatings.\n\nOn Facebook, various white men were stating their intention of going to Charlottesville for what they understood would be a huge gathering of the tribes, making plans of whom to meet up with and what to bring. Fears initially advised against carrying weapons, but he suggested keeping them close by. \u201cIt all comes down to police,\u201d he said on Facebook. \u201cIf they leave us to fight for ourselves like in Berkeley, we know to get ready for bricks to start flying.\u201d\n\nIn private communications on the chat service Discord, posted online by the progressive watchdog Unicorn Riot, organizers of Unite the Right spent weeks discussing tactics. The F.B.I. itself was limited in its surveillance capacity (though many left-wing groups argued that this did not prevent the bureau from monitoring their activities), and in the absence of comprehensive federal scrutiny, right-wing activists trawled through left-wing websites, shared photos of leading anti-fascist and racial-justice activists and infiltrated real-life gatherings. In advance of the event, leaked chats documented potential attendees openly advising their comrades to take note of any threats of violence so they could share them with the police. Erroll Southers later remarked on the sophistication of advising their followers not to bring cellphones, and sharing information among small cells of affinity groups: \u201cFrom an intelligence perspective, it was very impressive.\u201d", "A letter addressed to the superintendent from 12 community groups \u2014 including the American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho, Planned Parenthood and Immigrant Justice Idaho \u2014 said that \u201cthe school and community climate in Idaho continues to grow more harmful against specific groups and identities, including our Latinx friends, family and neighbors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe intent or misjudgments of the individuals involved does not undo the trauma experienced by students, families and communities,\u201d the letter said.\n\nMiddleton, Idaho, is a city of 7,400 just over 20 miles northwest of Boise. During the 2015-16 school year, about 12 percent of students at Middleton Heights Elementary School were Hispanic, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nIt was unclear why the employees dressed up the way they did. Two parents who visited the elementary school on Halloween, and who spoke only on the condition that their names not be used for safety reasons, said the faculty was having a costume competition where groups of teachers dressed up to represent various countries.\n\nState education officials said complaints \u2014 and any possible disciplinary or corrective action \u2014 would be handled by the local school board. Dr. Middleton and other school district officials, including board members, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nJ.J.

At their peak in 2012, 61 coalition soldiers were killed by such attacks.\n\nMajor Taylor decided to join the military someday after the Sept. 11 attacks while attending Brigham Young University, according to a profile published in January in The Deseret News, a Salt Lake City newspaper. His five brothers also joined the Army in the years after the 2001 attacks, it said.\n\nHis wife, Jennie Taylor, said in the article that service was an important part of their lives, and an example for their seven children. \u201cI hope they know that in our family, we help,\u201d she said. \u201cIn our family, we do what we can. If it\u2019s something we can do, and the call comes to serve, we say yes.\u201d\n\nMajor Taylor urged others to action as well, saying on Facebook in January that whether \u201creading to children at a school, or simply helping a neighbor, there are ways all around us to brighten someone\u2019s day.\u201d\n\nLast Sunday in what appeared to be his last Facebook post, he called on all Americans to vote. \u201cWhether the Republicans or the Democrats win,\u201d he said, it is important \u201cthat we all remember that we have far more as Americans that unites us than divides us.\u201d\n\nAccolades poured out for Major Taylor late Saturday across social media.\n\n\u201cHe was the best of men with the ability to see potential and possibility in everything around him,\u201d North Ogden\u2019s website said in announcing his death. It added, \u201cHe was patriotic to the core and a shining example of what an American politician should be.\u201d\n\nMitt Romney, the 2012 presidential candidate who is now running for the Senate in Utah, said on Twitter that he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d over the news.", "The city of Los Angeles is steeped in a rich punk tradition that dates back to the late 1970s. The films that make up \u201cThe Decline of Western Civilization,\u201d by Penelope Spheeris, are among its most compelling visual documents.\n\nIn the first of the series, Ms. Spheeris tells the story of Hollywood at the end of the 1970s, when Black Flag, the Germs, X, Fear and other bands were coming up.

Their wealth \u2014 the value of their home \u2014 has risen a bit in two years. The median sale price for a home in the United States was $214,000 in November 2016, according to data from Zillow, and the national appreciation rate since then implies such a house would now be worth $230,000.\n\nThings are trickier for a renter looking to buy a home, because of rising mortgage rates. A side effect of the surging economy and deficit-increasing tax cuts has been higher rates, which means that even though home prices aren\u2019t up all that much in the last two years, the cost for a buyer needing credit is considerably higher.\n\nThe rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.5 percent at election time two years ago, and is now 4.83 percent. Combined with the rise in the price of the median home, a middle-income American family looking to buy with 20 percent down would be looking at a monthly mortgage payment that is $196 a month higher now than in November 2016, wiping out gains from higher wages and lower taxes.\n\nA market boom for a few, and higher interest rates for others\n\nThe Trump administration has pointed to the booming stock market as evidence of success: The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index has returned about 29 percent, including reinvested dividends, since November 2016.\n\nBut middle-income families typically have minimal direct exposure to the stock market. Their financial holdings tend to be modest at best, meaning that rising stock prices create only a small wealth increase.\n\nAmong middle-income families in 2016, only 52 percent held stocks either directly or indirectly, such as through a mutual fund. And of those 52 percent, median stock holdings were only $15,000. (That would be up to around $19,000 now if they left the money in an S.&P. 500 index fund since then without making further contributions.)\n\nStock investments are much more a feature of upper-income brackets. The same survey showed that 94.7 percent of families in the top 10 percent of income held stocks, with a median value of $363,400.", "The Duterte administration has taken similar action against a number of foreign critics of the president\u2019s policies. In August, the immigration bureau detained an 84-year-old Australian professor, Gill Boehringer, at the Manila airport and barred him from entering the country because he had joined protests against Mr. Duterte.\n\nAlso this year, three foreign missionaries, including an American, were detained and deported in July after visiting the southern Philippines to investigate allegations that the army had carried out abuses there, including the December killings of at least eight members of an indigenous community in the province of Lake Sebu.\n\nOne of Sister Fox\u2019s lawyers, Katherine Panguban, said they would continue to appeal her case to the immigration bureau while the nun is in her native Melbourne. \u201cThis clearly shows that this government is intolerant of dissent,\u201d Ms. Panguban said of the case.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Duterte, Salvador Panelo, said on Saturday: \u201cThe departure of Sister Patricia Fox is a timely reminder to all foreigners who stay or sojourn in this country that they are not entitled to all the rights and privileges granted to the citizens of the Philippines.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe underwent a legal process where she was given the opportunity to be heard,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe wish Sister Fox well in her travel, and we thank her for whatever good deeds she has performed during her stay in the country.\u201d\n\nOfficials in the Catholic Church, which has considerable influence in the Philippines and has been active in the opposition to Mr. Duterte, said Sister Fox\u2019s expulsion was a \u201cblow to the missionary spirit\u201d of the church.\n\n\u201cThe government should have taken the moral high ground in taking up the case of the embattled nun,\u201d said Father Jerome Secillano of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines.", "At a recent gala benefit for the Getty Center in Los Angeles, Agnes Gund accepted an award for her achievements in philanthropy and did something fairly unusual among people in her social set: She barely spoke about herself.\n\nInstead, Ms. Gund used her six minutes at the lectern to praise the museum for its contributions to culture and toasted her fellow medal recipients \u2014 the curator Thelma Golden and the sculptor Richard Serra \u2014 whose work enriched her life.\n\nMs. Gund, 80, is patently uncomfortable accepting awards.

Those absent from the six letters of reprimand include the two senior officers who approved the mission and who then oversaw the operation as it went fatally awry.\n\nThe punishments appear to run counter to another narrative the Army has pushed in past months: the heroism displayed by the troops under fire. Almost all of the soldiers on the 11-man team, including those who were killed, have been nominated for valor awards, though they have yet to be approved. According to one official, senior officers at Special Operations Command believe that members of the team can be held responsible for failures before the mission and still be awarded commendations for their actions during the ambush.\n\nCapt.

It is another example of how the kinds of disasters exacerbated by climate change often hit minorities and the poor the hardest.\n\nFloods, hurricanes and fires may be natural phenomena, Mr. Davies said, \u201cbut what makes them dangerous, what turns them into the disaster, is the social and political factors.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019re in the break-down-the-walls, kick-the-glass-ceiling business.

The number of migrants in the Calais area has since dropped to 400 from 8,000. Many, including some who once lived in the Jungle and hoped to cross the English Channel, have decided to stay in St.-Omer.\n\nThey study, work or seek jobs and, in the case of some Soccs players, hope that their sport will help them establish themselves in the town of 16,000 people. St.-Omer has sheltered more than 5,600 since 2015, most of them in a center for underage refugees.\n\n\u201cWhenever young Afghans arrive in St.-Omer, one of the first things they ask is where they can play cricket,\u201d said Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Roger, the regional director of France Terre d\u2019Asile, a state-funded organization that helps refugees. \u201cSoccs gives them a framework. It helps them move forward and build something here.\u201d\n\nFrance is not exactly known for cricket, a sport played primarily in the former British Empire. It hardly figures in the national sports pantheon, with 1,800 cricket players in some 50 French clubs, compared with 2.2 million registered soccer players. Yet with the influx of migrants from Afghanistan, the number of cricket teams in northern France has grown to nine from two.\n\nThe Soccs are among them. In summer 2016, Mr. Ahmadzai and other Afghans were playing cricket with a homemade ball in a public park in St.-Omer when a local businessman who was out running, Christophe Silvie, stopped to ask them about the game. A few months later, Mr. Silvie and Mr. Ahmadzai founded the club with another volunteer living nearby, Nicolas Rochas.\n\nThe team practiced in a local gymnasium and won a first tournament.

This is not the first time America has been torn apart over how to respond to people of color desperate to escape inhuman conditions. Nor is it the first time a president has threatened to deploy federal troops to return them to the horrors from which they fled.\n\nI\u2019m thinking, of course, of African-Americans, who were regarded for much of American history not as human beings but as a species of animate property no different from cattle and sheep. Their circumstances under slavery were certainly different from those of illegal immigrants today. For one thing, the authorities in their \u201chomeland,\u201d the American South, wanted to keep them rather than lose them. Slave owners worked hard to prevent their slaves from running away. South Carolina adopted its first \u201cAct to Prevent Runaways\u201d as early as 1683. A hundred years later, Georgia established a nightly slave patrol in its main port city that came to be known as the \u201cSavannah Watch.\u201d In the waning years of British rule, colonial officials favored draining wetlands in order to prevent \u201cdeserting slaves and wild beasts\u201d from finding shelter in the swamps.\n\nYet despite such efforts, when delegates from the former British colonies convened at Philadelphia in 1787, the problem of runaway slaves posed a serious threat to the project of creating a new nation. If a durable union was to be forged between the South, where slavery was the bedrock of economy and culture, and the North, where it appeared headed toward extinction, slaves running for freedom across America\u2019s internal border would have to be stopped. In Article IV, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution, the founding fathers attempted to stop them:\n\nNo Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due.\n\nCharles Cotesworth Pinckney, delegate from South Carolina, exulted that \u201cwe have obtained a right to recover our slaves in whatever part of America they may take refuge, which is a right we had not before.\u201d", "The sisters, who were seen roughly between 158th and 163rd Streets, were seated several feet from the river, which could explain why they were found downriver, Chief Shea said.\n\nAt about 3 p.m. that day, a passer-by discovered their bodies, clad in similar black jackets and black leggings, below a pier about 100 blocks south near 68th Street.

We also have sources that detectives have developed thus far, statements that they would rather inflict harm on themselves, commit suicide, than return to Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nThe Farea family moved from Jeddah, a port city in Saudi Arabia, to Fairfax, Va., about three years ago.

The explanation for Mr. Trump\u2019s newly soothing tone lies less in the state of trade negotiations \u2014 which remain on hold \u2014 than in the president\u2019s domestic political calculations, particularly in states heavily dependent on trade, like Indiana.\n\nFour days before a midterm election that features a nip-and-tuck Senate race in this state, Mr. Trump is trying to quell fears of a protracted trade war with China.

They very much want to make a deal.\u201d", "The right way to deal with the caravan crisis is to make clear that it is no crisis. The marchers pose no threat. The United States has clear laws governing refugees and well-funded agencies to enforce those laws, and it\u2019s an embarrassing waste of money to send troops to the border. In fact, illegal border crossings have significantly declined in recent years. The country must and will continue to enforce the laws that control its borders, as Mr. Obama himself did as president during an earlier, actual surge of Central American migrants, when he took the difficult step of dispatching National Guard troops to the border and detaining many mothers and children.\n\nLonger-term questions about how to put the country\u2019s approach to immigration back on a rational, moral foundation are more difficult. Republican hard-liners defeated bipartisan attempts at comprehensive immigration reform in 2007 and 2014. In the Trump era, Democrats have found the issue of immigration even more confusing; a couple of Democratic senatorial candidates have even lined up behind Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s cruel treatment of immigrants and race-baiting about nonexistent threats do not amount to a solution. Managing the entry of refugees and other immigrants, and creating a fair system to deal with the millions of undocumented immigrants within the borders, are serious matters in need of common sense and elemental humanity.\n\nThe country needs to streamline the asylum system and establish generous quotas of immigrants and refugees from around the world. To be effective, any immigration plan has to include serious development aid to Central America\u2019s troubled states. Cutting off what little aid they get, as Mr. Trump has threatened to do, will only create more caravans.\n\nPeople seeking to partake of the American dream have always been central to America\u2019s identity and strength. How the country treats them goes straight to its core values. The Democrats cannot sit this one out, especially when the Republican leader is so blind to the true sources of America\u2019s greatness.\n\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.", "But the trial has also shed light on a school\u2019s unwavering commitment to diversity and to enrolling underrepresented minorities, whom it views as crucial to its educational mission.\n\nHarvard turned the case into a referendum on diversity and the future of affirmative action.
