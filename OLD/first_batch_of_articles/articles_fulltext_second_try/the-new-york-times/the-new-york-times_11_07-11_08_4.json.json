["By wading into the topic of player value, with a new off-season just underway, James may have launched himself into the kind of Twitter lava that has caused others \u2014 in entertainment, media and elsewhere \u2014 to lose their jobs. James hopes not.\n\n\u201cI enjoy working for the Red Sox,\u201d he said, \u201cand I would like to continue that as much as I can.\u201d\n\nIn the baseball industry, few things are as politically poisonous as floating the notion that players are replaceable. Players were furious last winter by teams\u2019 sluggish approach to free agency, and many suspected the owners of colluding against them as they did in the 1980s. The former agent Brodie Van Wagenen \u2014 now the Mets\u2019 general manager, of all things \u2014 even threatened a boycott of spring training.\n\nThe owners\u2019 reluctance to spend on free agents was often tied to analytics, and the movement James spawned by highlighting the objective reasoning behind the metrics. Front offices increasingly strive to be efficient in finding value, and rewarding free agents for past performance can be wasteful compared with using younger and cheaper talent.\n\nMany of the free agents who signed late last winter did turn out to be overvalued. Could a replacement-level starter have matched the production of, say, Baltimore\u2019s Alex Cobb, who was 5-15 with a 4.90 earned run average after signing a four-year, $57 million contract in March? What about Lance Lynn, who signed with Minnesota in March for one year and $12 million, then was 10-10, 4.77, for the Twins and the Yankees?\n\nOn Twitter, James cited no specific examples of players being overpaid. But he said it was \u201casinine to say that players making only a few million a year are underpaid,\u201d as fans and reporters often say when comparing players\u2019 salaries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of which perspective you choose,\u201d James said on Thursday, adding later: \u201cI got in trouble by trying to tell people you don\u2019t have to choose the players\u2019 perspective. That is what I was trying to say: You can choose the perspective of broader society. It makes equal sense to do so. But the sabermetric perspective of it \u2014 the view from the marketplace \u2014 has become so dominant that it squashes its opposition.\u201d", "Lina Hidalgo never thought she would work in politics or run for office.\n\nShe and her family fled their home country of Colombia as a drug war raged, arriving in the United States in 2005. She studied law, public policy and political science at elite universities as she pursued a career influencing government from the outside.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Ms. Hidalgo, a 27-year-old Democrat, narrowly won an upset election to lead Harris County, which includes Houston and is the third-most populous county in the country and the largest in Texas. She beat the 11-year Republican incumbent to become the first woman and the first Latina elected to the county judge office.\n\nMs. Hidalgo said she decided to run for office after the 2016 election because of the divisiveness it displayed. She ran as an outsider candidate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not tied to the powers that be,\u201d she said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cPeople were inspired. Their hearts led them to speak up in a year in which our democracy seemed to be under threat.\u201d", "1. Investigators were searching for clues to why a former Marine armed with a .45-caliber handgun opened fire at a crowded California dance hall on Wednesday night, killing 12 people.\n\nHe was identified as Ian David Long, 28. He died after being confronted by police officers, including one who became his victim, a 29-year veteran of the local sheriff\u2019s office, Sgt. Ron Helus. Above, an investigator interviewing a witness.\n\nWitnesses described a chaotic scene at the club, which was filled with hundreds of people, many of them college students. Patrons rushed toward the exits and broke windows to escape.", "Then, too, there is the lingering issue of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s primary challenger, Cynthia Nixon, who is friends with Mr. de Blasio. The mayor didn\u2019t officially take sides in the primary, but the legislative session could be the first test of whether Mr. Cuomo exercises his gold-medal skills in holding a grudge.\n\nIn a radio interview on Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo described his relationship with Mr. de Blasio as complicated but functional. \u201cI have my idea of what an effective Democratic progressive is; he has his idea of what it means to be a Democratic progressive,\u201d the governor said on WVOX. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not friends. It doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t work on things together.\u201d\n\nCompromise, of course, is usually easier when members are of similar political persuasions, and if you peer closely, you could discern signs on Wednesday of a d\u00e9tente on a congestion pricing proposal for the city, an idea that Mr. Cuomo supports. Mr. de Blasio has been softening his public statements on congestion pricing in recent weeks, and on Wednesday he again said that it could be part of a mixture of financing sources for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.\n\nMr. de Blasio also said that the new dynamic in Albany could improve relations with Mr. Cuomo. \u201cWe\u2019ve both said publicly and privately we want to try, in his new term, to do better at finding common ground, and I\u2019m going to work on that consistently.\u201d\n\nThe State Assembly has always been the friendliest terrain for Mr. de Blasio, with dozens of city-based Democrats, and will likely remain that way. Mr. Heastie has usually been viewed as his closest ally.\n\nBut the State Senate was a snake pit for the mayor, largely stemming from an attempt in 2014 by Mr. de Blasio to defeat Senate Republicans that backfired badly. Republicans won seats, and his aggressive fund-raising tactics led to state and federal investigations that became a major distraction through part of his first term.\n\nSenate Republicans subsequently tormented him whenever possible, blocking his initiatives or letting him turn slowly before they agreed to extend mayoral control of city schools (for much shorter periods than he desired).", "WASHINGTON \u2014 A Democratic senator has urged President Trump to allow American humanitarian aid workers into North Korea, despite a recent ban on travel to what officials consider a hostile nuclear state but also one of the world\u2019s poorest nations.\n\nThe senator, Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said in a letter dated Nov. 7 that he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by reports that the Trump administration was barring aid workers \u201cfrom shipping supplies or traveling to North Korea as they seek to provide the most basic humanitarian assistance.\u201d\n\nMr. Markey praised Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to engage in diplomacy with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, but said the aid workers needed to be allowed to do their jobs. Aid groups provide a range of services, including agricultural training and surgery, but are finding it impossible to enter North Korea because of new State Department restrictions.\n\n\u201cThe humanitarian situation in North Korea is far too dire for these draconian policies,\u201d Mr. Markey wrote in the letter to Mr. Trump that was also sent to Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary.", "The project came together in early 2018. Well, sort of. Mr. Thomas and Ms. Shur planned to shoot the tableaus at the \u201cInto Action\u201d festival in downtown Los Angeles in January. But the morning of the shoot, they lost their space. \u201cThe logistics were crazy,\u201d Ms. Shur said. \u201cHe has the ideas and I have to execute.\u201d They were prepared to drop the project altogether, but within hours Mr. Thomas found an empty studio across the street.\n\nThat weekend a parade of people streamed through the front doors to be photographed for recreations of Mr. Rockwell\u2019s \u201cFreedom of Speech\u201d and \u201cFreedom of Worship.\u201d The actress Rosario Dawson showed up. So, too, did the rapper Chuck D, a founder of Public Enemy. Mr. Thomas said Gina Belafonte, the daughter of the actor and activist Harry Belafonte, came with a group of ecumenical leaders. Even Dolores Huerta, a co-founder of the United Farm Workers with the activist Cesar Chavez, stopped by. By the end of the weekend, more than 150 people had been photographed, Mr. Thomas said. They became the underpinnings for the final photographic compilations.\n\n\u201cAll of these people have their own communities,\u201d he said of those photographed. \u201cEveryone wants to be a good person. The demonizing of people doesn\u2019t help.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what led Maggie Meiners, an artist from suburban Chicago, to create a series of her own. In 2008, she visited the Norman Rockwell Museum with her husband and was struck by the elderly couple at the head of the table in \u201cFreedom From Want.\u201d That year, Californians had voted to overturn an earlier decision of the California Supreme Court to legalize same-sex marriage.", "[Read our review of \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\u201d]\n\nNot much has happened since the last movie; mostly, people and parts have been shifted in preparation for the next great narrative heave forward. Once again, Newt is scurrying about while nefarious doings unfold in separate story lines. One is dominated by Gellert Grindelwald (a perfectly unmemorable Johnny Depp), an evil wizard who looks like he\u2019s been dipped in flour (and who last appeared in the more flattering form of Colin Farrell). Grindelwald is consolidating his power and has big plans. These have become more transparent as fascism has seeped into the story, totalitarianism\u2019s threat increasingly giving dark meaning to all the violence and ugly phrases like \u201cpure blood.\u201d\n\nRowling is a literary magpie and first-rate synthesizer, and her stated inspirations for the Harry Potter books range from classical mythology to Jane Austen. Traces of the Bible, Shakespeare, Tolkien and other Western-lit staples are sprinkled throughout that series and therefore this one, too. However intentional, they form part of a cultural database, which is as smart as it is appealing. (The influences flatter but don\u2019t overwhelm readers, and offer different interpretive portals into the tale.) Given some of these influences, it\u2019s no surprise that the series is touched by death; given the arc of history, it\u2019s also no surprise that it has morphed into an apocalyptic war story.\n\nA bleak, violent end \u2014 and the intimation of a worldwide cataclysm \u2014 looms from the very first scene of \u201cThe Crimes of Grindelwald.\u201d Directed by David Yates and written by Rowling, the movie opens with a fierce, visually chaotic prison break that springs Grindelwald and sets the angry mood. The bad times rush in along with the assorted villains bringing escalating violence. By the time Newt materializes with his magical suitcase, where he often keeps his roaring, scuttling menagerie (mostly, sometimes) contained, the movie already seems like a series finale. It\u2019s so freighted with foreboding that even the would-be whimsy feels leaden.", "THE ARTIST TINO SEHGAL believes there are enough objects in the world. His art involves people, not things, and the process of selling it is entirely verbal. Sehgal does not issue receipts. He does not permit his work to be photographed or filmed, nor does he produce catalogs or even wall labels to accompany his exhibitions. In fact, he eschews all forms of documentation, written or otherwise, in relation to the sale, presentation and care of his work. His pieces, which he calls \u201cconstructed situations,\u201d usually involve \u201cplayers\u201d or \u201cparticipants\u201d who have been trained by the artist to enact specific actions. At the 2005 Venice Biennale, in a piece titled \u201cThis Is So Contemporary,\u201d participants dressed as security guards leapt around visitors to the German Pavilion chanting, \u201cOoh, this is so contemporary, contemporary, contemporary!\u201d before resuming nonchalant poses. For a 2010 show at the Guggenheim Museum called \u201cThis Progress,\u201d a series of increasingly older interpreters guided visitors up the museum\u2019s spiraled rotunda while carrying on free-form conversations that began with the visitor\u2019s personal definition of progress. His most famous work, \u201cKiss,\u201d from 2002, involves a man and a woman recreating iconic embraces from artworks throughout history, inspired by oeuvres as distinct as those of Auguste Rodin and Jeff Koons, on the floor of an exhibition space.\n\nDespite its lack of physical existence outside of the moment of actual enactment, Sehgal does sell his art \u2014 and often for quite a lot of money. His situations, or rather, the right to stage them, can be bought in editions, generally for five-figure sums, and can only be purchased by oral contract at mandatory in-person meetings between representatives from his New York City gallery, Marian Goodman, a notary and the prospective buyer; Sehgal or members of his studio are also usually present. No paper contracts, bills of sale or certificates of authenticity are exchanged. Potentially complicating this transaction further: The artist, who lives in Berlin, rarely makes trans-Atlantic trips in an effort to reduce his carbon footprint.\n\nIt is an understatement to say that the 42-year-old Sehgal is obsessive about his work, from its concept to the lexicon used to describe it. His practice has more to do with theater and acting techniques (many of his players are professional actors) than it does with the tradition of performance art, the de facto description for any kind of live experimentation in the art world. And it\u2019s not strictly conceptual art, either, if one goes by Sol LeWitt\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe execution\u201d of such art \u201cis a perfunctory affair.\u201d The reverence Sehgal inspires among curators, collectors and other artists is informed by his particularities: Following an interview for this piece, one slightly panicked museum official wrote to request that any accidental uses of the word \u201cperformance\u201d be corrected. (Sehgal feels that term suggests works that are more fleeting and have more of a wall between audience and performer than exists in his art.) \u201cI would hate for that slip-up to offend Tino,\u201d the employee wrote. \u201cI think it would be a bit serious, actually.\u201d\n\nAsad Raza, an artist and frequent collaborator of Sehgal\u2019s, describes the process of purchasing a Sehgal as \u201calmost like a kind of therapy\u201d for those who buy it \u2014 an altogether different process than the moneyed art world is used to, even as museums and collectors expand their holdings to include unconventional performance and conceptual art. Last August, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, part of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., announced the acquisition of its first-ever live, experiential artwork: a 2006 piece by Sehgal called \u201cThis You,\u201d which began a six-week run at the museum over Labor Day weekend. It consisted of a female singer, stationed in one of the museum\u2019s outdoor spaces, serenading individual visitors one at a time with a song of her choice (depending on how the visitor inspired her). It\u2019s one thing for a collector to agree to Sehgal\u2019s terms \u2014 certainly there are individuals wealthy enough to spend five figures and have nothing to show for it but the memory of a handshake \u2014 but Sehgal\u2019s process seems particularly daunting for institutions, especially federally funded ones like the Hirshhorn: How does a government-owned museum buy something without a paper trail? And how do conservators preserve nothing for posterity?", "It has become my habit to check social media when I first wake up, a consequence of this modern age. I wasn\u2019t sleeping well, so this morning I checked my phone around 5 a.m., expecting to see continued analysis of the midterm elections and maybe a charming news item about Cardi B. I should have known better.\n\nAccording to statistics from the Gun Violence Archive, there have been 307 mass shootings in the 312 days of 2018. They are a commonplace occurrence. This is a horrifying thing to say, but it is the truth. We need to say this truth over and over. We need to face this horror without looking away. We live in a country where there are relatively few restrictions on gun ownership and where our cultural tolerance for mass murder appears to be infinite.\n\nLess than a month ago I visited California State University Channel Islands, not far from where the shooting on Wednesday night took place. I was greeted by a deeply engaged audience. We had a thoughtful discussion about sexual violence, justice, trauma and healing. Some of those students might have been at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, Calif., Wednesday night, doing what college students are supposed to be doing \u2014 dancing and hanging out with friends, having fun. As I read the news Thursday morning, my chest tightened. I read quotes from students from that campus describing the sparks and the smoke they saw. I felt resignation creeping in.\n\nOver the past two years there has been increased security at my events, armed guards. Sometimes they are there because I have received a threat. Sometimes they are there because I am a black woman with opinions and the threat is already implied. Every time I go on stage, I look out into the audience and wonder if there is a man with a gun in the sea of faces. I am not scared of him. I am resigned to the inevitability of him pointing that gun at me, at the crowd, and pulling the trigger. I don\u2019t want to be this resigned. I don\u2019t want you to be, either.", "Not all his pictures were of war zones and refugee camps; he documented a rehabilitation hospital in Laos, dissident artists in Moscow, a tour of the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande. Whatever the subject, the label \u201chumanist\u201d was invariably attached to him and his pictures; he had the ability to infuse an image with heart and respect.\n\n\u201cWhen he works with people, he becomes almost invisible,\u201d Mr. Berger, the critic, essayist and novelist who died last year, once noted. \u201cThat is to say, after a few minutes, he is there, he is taking pictures and people (even people who are being photographed) do not know. And I believe that this gift \u2014 because it is a gift to John \u2014 comes because of an extraordinary discretion, a discretion that is related to how he can relate to others. So it gives people the opportunity to keep their own presence and their own soul.\u201d\n\nImage \u201cThe Photograph Photographed, Jerusalem,\u201d 1979. Credit Jean Mohr, via Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Elys\u00e9e\n\nMr. Mohr collaborated with Mr. Berger on three books: \u201cA Fortunate Man: The Story of a Country Doctor\u201d (1967); \u201cA Seventh Man,\u201d about migrant workers (1975); and \u201cAnother Way of Telling\u201d (1982). All were praised for the intricacy of the collaboration.\n\n\u201cJean Mohr\u2019s defining characteristic \u2014 the one repeated by others, the one certainly in evidence every time I met him, and perhaps the one which made the eloquence of his photographs possible \u2014 was his humility,\u201d Tom Overton, who has edited two books about Mr. Berger, said by email. \u201cJohn Berger admitted himself somewhat less humble when he claimed the three books they worked on together \u2018considerably extended the narrative dialogues that are possible between text and images in book form.\u2019 Looking back now, they still haven\u2019t really been surpassed.\u201d\n\nIn 1986 Mr. Mohr was involved in a similar collaboration with Dr. Said, the literary scholar, called \u201cAfter the Last Sky: Palestinian Lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe saw us as we would have seen ourselves, at once inside and outside our world,\u201d Dr. Said, an advocate of Palestinian independence who died in 2003, wrote in that book of Mr. Mohr\u2019s photographs.", "Once the president makes a proclamation identifying who is barred by the new regulations, an official said, those people could apply for two other, smaller programs that are much less likely to result in them being allowed to stay in the United States.\n\nAn administration official who briefed reporters said the two programs would satisfy the United States\u2019 treaty obligations \u2014 a claim critics say is not true. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details of the rules before they are published, said the new regulations were supported by laws that gave the president broad authority to control who entered the United States.\n\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act says the president \u201cmay by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\u201d\n\nIn writing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision upholding the president\u2019s travel ban this summer, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said the immigration act \u201cexudes deference to the president in every clause.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has fumed at his advisers for months about the surge of immigrants crossing into the United States from Mexico. Enraged by the caravan of several thousand migrants that began forming in Honduras and has been slowly making its way to the United States-Mexico border, he ordered more than 5,000 active-duty troops to the border to prevent the migrants from crossing.\n\nBy early this week, that caravan still had about 4,000 or 5,000 people and had made it to Mexico City. Smaller caravans of several hundred people each are reportedly also headed toward the United States.\n\nSince taking office nearly two years ago, Mr. Trump has railed against what he calls weak laws that allow migrants who are caught crossing illegally to claim asylum under false pretenses and then be released into the United States, sometimes for years, as they wait for the courts to determine the validity of their asylum claim.", "A federal grand jury on Thursday indicted the captain of a duck boat that sank in July during a violent thunderstorm on a Missouri lake, killing 17 passengers, including nine from the same family.\n\nThe captain, Kenneth Scott McKee, 51, faces 17 counts of misconduct, negligence or inattention to duty by a ship\u2019s officer resulting in death.\n\nThe indictment accused Mr. McKee of failing to adequately assess the weather conditions before the duck boat set off on a tour of Table Rock Lake in southwestern Missouri, near the tourist town of Branson.

Yet when the Supreme Court formally welcomed Brett M. Kavanaugh as an associate justice on Thursday, there were still echoes of the rancor his nomination to the court ignited.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh skipped the most public element of the ceremony, a traditional walk down the court\u2019s front steps with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., \u201cout of an abundance of caution, due to security concerns,\u201d according to a spokeswoman for the court, Kathleen Arberg.\n\nInside the majestic chamber, where members of Washington\u2019s Republican establishment mingled amid the marble columns before the investiture began, there were reminders not just of the contentious confirmation process but also of the turmoil on the Trump legal team, which deepened this week after President Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nAround Justice Kavanaugh was a vivid tableau of Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington, a city rived by the battle over the Supreme Court and shadowed by questions about the rule of law. For about 15 minutes, many of the key players were gathered in the same room.", "This is not the first time Mr. Koons has found himself in trouble thanks to works that originally appeared in his landmark 1988 exhibition \u201cBanality,\u201d based on images from advertising and magazines. Shortly after the original show, at the Sonnabend Gallery in New York, he was sued by the photographer Art Rogers, whose image of a couple holding eight German shepherd puppies formed the basis of the sculpture \u201cString of Puppies.\u201d The case was settled for an undisclosed amount.\n\nHe also settled two subsequent lawsuits stemming from the show, one with United Feature Syndicate over his use of the character Odie from the \u201cGarfield\u201d comic strip. Last year, a Paris court decided that Mr. Koons had infringed the copyright of another French photographer to make a porcelain sculpture of two naked children holding some flowers.\n\nPhotographs of that sculpture, called \u201cNaked,\u201d were also used in the 2014 exhibition at the Pompidou Center; the actual statue did not appear because it was damaged on the way there.\n\nThe Gagosian Gallery, which represents Mr. Koons, did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the Pompidou Center said it had no comment as it had only just started reading the judgment.\n\nMr. Koons has been on the other side of copyright cases, too. In 2010, his lawyers sent cease and desist letters to two businesses making and selling $30 bookends that resembled his famous \u201cBalloon Dog\u201d sculptures \u2014 prompting much internet mockery about whether Mr. Koons was claiming the rights to all balloon dogs.\n\nThursday\u2019s ruling is nowhere near the biggest stir Mr. Koons has caused in Paris recently. For two years, he has been trying to find a home for his sculpture \u201cBouquet of Tulips,\u201d a monumental gift to the city meant to be a tribute to the victims of the 2015 and 2016 terror attacks.\n\nHe has faced complaints that the sculpture, 34 feet high and 27 feet wide, is more product placement than tribute, and seen opposition to potential locations. But in October, he appeared to find a solution.

Ms. De Salvo has made sure that we do. Right at the start we find a lineup of his Pop classics: Brillo Box sculptures, paintings of Campbell Soup cans, Coca-Cola bottles, camouflage patterns, and a whole gallery filled with silk-screened flowers and electric pink cows. It\u2019s as if the curator wanted to ground us in the familiar, in order to move us on.\n\nMoving on, in this case, means going backward in time, to when the artist was young, and still living at home in Pittsburgh, and still named Andrew Warhola. It could not have been easy to grow up, as he did, a sickly femme kid with bad skin and big ambitions in a Pennsylvania industrial town during the Depression. Almost inevitably, because he was gay and the child of immigrant parents, he stood at once outside and inside mainstream American culture. (He said that his mother, Julia Warhola, spoke English with such a heavy Slovak accent that he had trouble understanding her.)\n\nHis aesthetic sense developed from this dual culture positioning too. On the one hand, he was entranced by American pop culture: newspapers, advertising, product design, Hollywood fanzines. At the same time, he was deeply influenced by the religious art he saw \u2014 gold-painted icons of saints, Crucifixions, Last Judgments \u2014 in the Byzantine Catholic church he devoutly attended, and by the ornamental embroideries and drawings made by his mother at home.", "A federal appeals court on Thursday upheld a nationwide injunction against the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to revoke deportation protections for some 700,000 young \u201cDreamers\u201d who were brought into the United States illegally as children.\n\nJeff Sessions, who until Wednesday was President Trump\u2019s attorney general, announced in September that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program would end gradually over six months, prompting legal challenges and protests. Mr. Trump has criticized the program, known as DACA, as an \u201camnesty-first approach,\u201d and said that President Barack Obama had overstepped his authority by introducing it.\n\nThursday\u2019s ruling, from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, was the first time that a federal circuit court had weighed in at this stage on one of the country\u2019s most contentious immigration issues. It brought DACA closer to review by the United States Supreme Court, which ultimately will have to resolve the various legal claims swirling around the program.\n\nThe review may already be on a faster track after the Trump administration earlier this week petitioned the Supreme Court to consider the issue immediately, without waiting for rulings in the lower courts. The Supreme Court in February had denied a previous request for expedited review, signaling that the justices at least at that point had preferred to wait for appellate courts to weigh in.", "SPARKILL, N.Y. \u2014 In much of the United States, this is an era of disappearing tackle football programs.\n\nTightening budgets and concerns about safety and liability have combined to spell the end of football at colleges like Hofstra in Hempstead, N.Y., and St. Mary\u2019s College of California.\n\nThen there is St. Thomas Aquinas, a 65-year-old college founded by Dominican nuns, which is currently running a counter play. It started a football program this season instead of ending one. The move, part of a strategy to increase male enrollment, not really one to compete for gridiron glory, came with a wrinkle: At St. Thomas Aquinas, students would compete in sprint football, in which the players cannot weigh more than 178 pounds.\n\nThere is blocking and tackling, and players wear helmets and shoulder pads, and the game has plenty of opportunity for injury. But in sprint football, punishing collisions between 300-pound linemen and 190-pound tailbacks cannot occur. The game is more about speed and swing plays out wide than about pounding runs into the line and passes over the middle.", "Everyone is delivering post-mortems on Tuesday\u2019s elections, so for what it\u2019s worth, here\u2019s mine: Despite some bitter disappointments and lost ground in the Senate, Democrats won a huge victory. They broke the Republican monopoly on federal power, and that\u2019s a very big deal for an administration that has engaged in blatant corruption and abuse of power, in the belief that an impenetrable red wall would always protect it from accountability. They also made major gains at the state level, which will have a big impact on future elections.\n\nBut given this overall success, how do we explain those Senate losses? Many people have pointed out that this year\u2019s Senate map was unusually bad for Democrats, consisting disproportionately of states Donald Trump won in 2016. But there was actually a deeper problem, one that will pose long-term problems, not just for Democrats, but for the legitimacy of our whole political system. For economic and demographic trends have interacted with political change to make the Senate deeply unrepresentative of American reality.\n\nHow is America changing? Immigration and our growing racial and cultural diversity are only part of the story. We\u2019re also witnessing a transformation in the geography of our economy, as dynamic industries increasingly gravitate to big metropolitan areas where there are already large numbers of highly educated workers. It\u2019s not an accident that Amazon is planning to put its two new headquarters in New York and the Washington D.C. metropolitan area, both places with an existing deep pool of talent.\n\nObviously not everyone lives \u2014 or wants to live \u2014 in these growth centers of the new economy. But we are increasingly a nation of urbanites and suburbanites. Almost 60 percent of us live in metropolitan areas with more than a million people, more than 70 percent in areas with more than 500,000 residents. Conservative politicians may extol the virtues of a \u201creal America\u201d of rural areas and small towns, but the real real America in which we live, while it contains small towns, is mostly metropolitan.", "California, where a gunman killed 12 people in a bar in Thousand Oaks on Wednesday night, has some of the strictest gun laws in the country. It was the first state to ban assault weapons in 1989 after a shooting at a Stockton elementary school left five students dead. In the wake of several recent mass shootings \u2014 including one in February in Parkland, Fla., where a gunman killed 17 students and employees at a high school \u2014 state legislators put forward at least nine new gun control bills in response. Here\u2019s a look at the state of gun regulations in California:\n\nRecent Legislation\n\n\u2022 Raised the age for buying rifles and shotguns from 18 to 21.\n\n\u2022 Imposed lifetime bans on gun ownership for those convicted of domestic violence or involuntarily hospitalized for mental illness more than once in a one-year period.\n\n\u2022 Strengthened a law prohibiting multiburst trigger devices, including bump stocks.\n\n\u2022 Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed two other measures. One would have prohibited the purchase of more than one long gun a month. The other would have allowed teachers and employers to petition the courts to have guns confiscated from people who are a danger to themselves and others.\n\nPrevious Regulations\n\n\u2022 All firearm and ammunition dealers must obtain a state license. Private gun sales must be completed through a licensed firearms dealer, requiring a background check and mandatory waiting period. The state maintains permanent records of firearm sales.\n\n\u2022 In 2016, Governor Brown signed a law expanding the prohibition on assault weapons and regulating the sale of ammunition. With few exceptions, the possession, manufacture, transfer, sale, or lending of assault weapons is prohibited within the state. The state can issue permits for the possession of assault rifles to certain law enforcement agencies or other approved individuals.", "Francis Lai, the French composer best known for his themes for the movies \u201cLove Story\u201d and \u201cA Man and a Woman,\u201d died on Wednesday. He was 86.\n\nHis death was announced by France\u2019s Culture Ministry, which did not say where he died or specify the cause.\n\nBorn on April 6, 1932, in Nice, France, Mr. Lai was a self-taught musician who began his career playing piano and accordion. He worked as the singer \u00c9dith Piaf\u2019s accompanist in Paris and later wrote songs for her, Yves Montand and others.", "My hope for release from the waking nightmare of our political world was waning as I went to bed on Tuesday night. Although I live in Massachusetts (which re-elected its intrepid Democratic senator) by way of Michigan (which elected a Democratic governor), I was keeping an anxious watch on the tight race in Montana, where it looked as though the incumbent Democratic senator Jon Tester might lose.\n\nYes, Montana. It is hard for most people on the eastern side of the Mississippi to believe that I have ties to the place. Once, when I was mailing a package from Ann Arbor to Whitefish, the postal clerk, a black man with whom I often joked, insisted that I had made a mistake on the address. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anybody in Montana,\u201d he said. I told him the package was for my sister-in-law, and that I did, in fact, know her. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve never been there,\u201d he teased.\n\nI have been there. I have lived in, visited and driven through Montana\u2019s cities, towns and reservations for more than 25 years. I have researched and published on African-American history in the state. My husband is a Montana native, in both meanings of the phrase, and I have Native American as well as white relatives there. We all love Senator Tester, who is from a ranching family in Big Sandy (down the highway from my husband\u2019s home reservation), because he is an old-school, boots on the dusty ground Democrat; because he wanted to hire my sister-in-law (a different one) as his liaison to Native communities; because he castigated Donald Trump\u2019s policy of separating immigrant families; and because he was willing to vote his conscience against Brett Kavanaugh. And Mr. Tester was under attack.", "The problem here, however, is that exercise of the inherent power, while legally sound, has long been considered cumbersome, constitutionally suspect and politically unpalatable. For that reason, it hasn\u2019t been employed since 1935, and the new Democratic majority is very unlikely to dust it off.\n\nSecond, the House can file criminal contempt charges with the local United States attorney under a statute that says that the prosecutor has the \u201cduty\u201d to bring the matter before the grand jury.\n\nThe rub here is that the executive branch has taken the position that its duty is really its prerogative, under the argument that separation of power concerns preclude another branch from instructing it when to bring a case. Thus, a command from the president not to bring the case is a functional checkmate.\n\nThat leaves a final tool, which has become the de facto sole option: Congress can bring a civil enforcement action under the 1978 Ethics in Government Act. If the district court agrees that the subpoena is valid, it can order compliance, backed by its own contempt powers in the event of continued intransigence, including jailing the offender until he complies.\n\nIt seems straightforward. And in fact, until about 15 years ago, the House had never had to bring an enforcement action to prevail in a subpoena battle with the executive branch. Just the threat of a contempt action was sufficient to produce a negotiated compromise.\n\nBut the political dynamic underwent a seismic shift in 2007, with the House\u2019s investigation of the mass firing of United States attorneys by the George W. Bush administration. Congress pulled the trigger on a contempt action but the executive branch returned fire. The House issued a subpoena to Harriet Miers, by then the former White House counsel, and the White House asserted executive privilege.\n\nThe district court held for Congress, but the appeal was still pending when the 110th Congress, the legal entity bringing suit, expired in January 2009. The parties reached a settlement under which Congress got some of the documents it was seeking. But it took two years \u2014 longer than the life of the Congress. A similar protracted and mixed verdict occurred when the House brought suit to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt over his noncompliance with a subpoena in an inquiry into the Justice Department\u2019s handling of a gun trafficking investigation.", "Devah Pager, a Harvard sociologist best known for rigorously measuring and documenting racial discrimination in the labor market and in the criminal justice system, died on Nov. 2 at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 46.\n\nMichael Shohl, her husband, said the cause was pancreatic cancer.\n\nIn her seminal work, Dr. Pager, who was the Peter and Isabel Malkin professor of public policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and a professor of sociology at the university, documented what she called the \u201cpowerful effects of race\u201d on hiring decisions, which she said contributed to persistent inequality. Employers, she found, were more likely to hire a white man, even if he had a felony conviction, than a black man with no criminal record.\n\n\u201cThis suggests that being black in America today is essentially like having a felony conviction in terms of one\u2019s chances of finding employment,\u201d Dr. Pager said in a video interview with the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality.\n\nHer finding, which appeared first in her doctoral dissertation in 2003 at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, surprised many.", "\u4ed6\u7684\u51fa\u5e2d\u4ee4\u4eba\u60f3\u8d77\u7f8e\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u6301\u7eed\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u8fd8\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u52a0\u6df1\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u5728\u9ad8\u79d1\u6280\u9738\u6743\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u4e89\u6597\u4e0d\u4f11\u3002\u5728\u906d\u4e2d\u56fd\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u673a\u6784\u62d2\u7edd\u6279\u51c6\u540e\uff0c\u9ad8\u901a\u516c\u53f8\u4eca\u5e74\u53d6\u6d88\u4e86\u4ee5440\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u6536\u8d2d\u4e00\u5bb6\u8377\u5170\u82af\u7247\u5236\u9020\u5546\u7684\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u6b64\u4e3e\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u89c6\u4e3a\u8d38\u6613\u6218\u4e2d\u7684\u62a5\u590d\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u79d1\u6280\u4ea7\u4e1a\u6b63\u5728\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u8ba4\u771f\u5730\u5bf9\u5f85\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u610f\u5916\u540e\u679c\u2014\u2014\u4ee5\u53ca\u5e2e\u52a9\u653f\u5e9c\u3002 Jonathan Browning for The New York Times\n\n\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u5f53\u4e2d\uff0c\u79c1\u8425\u4f01\u4e1a\u672c\u5468\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u589e\u52a0\u653f\u5e9c\u652f\u6301\u4e0e\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u56fd\u6709\u516c\u53f8\u5219\u8bc1\u660e\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u79d1\u6280\u65b9\u9762\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u6ce8\u5b9a\u843d\u540e\u3002\n\n\u817e\u8baf\u9ad8\u7ba1\u9648\u52c7\u5728\u63a5\u53d7\u91c7\u8bbf\u65f6\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4e0e\u6267\u6cd5\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\n\n\u636e\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u653f\u6cbb\u6d3b\u52a8\u4eba\u58eb\u56e0\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u5fae\u4fe1\u4e0a\u6240\u8bf4\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u800c\u906d\u5230\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002\u804a\u5929\u8bb0\u5f55\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u6cd5\u5ead\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u81f3\u4e8e\u4eba\u4eec\u5728\u731c\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u4e5f\u8bb8\u662f\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u5546\u817e\u8baf\u3002\n\n\u9648\u52c7\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u817e\u8baf\u4f1a\u5411\u653f\u5e9c\u62a5\u544a\u5728\u5176\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u975e\u6cd5\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u4e4b\u540e\u5f53\u5c40\u53ef\u4ee5\u8981\u6c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4ed6\u8bf4\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7528\u6237\u767b\u5f55\u817e\u8baf\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5730\u70b9\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b58\u50a8\u957f\u8fbe\u516d\u4e2a\u6708\u3002\u4f46\u9648\u52c7\u5426\u8ba4\u516c\u53f8\u7ed9\u6267\u6cd5\u4eba\u5458\u7559\u4e86\u540e\u95e8\uff0c\u4f9b\u4ed6\u4eec\u81ea\u7531\u5730\u6d4f\u89c8\u804a\u5929\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u3002\n\n\u4e2d\u79d1\u8679\u9738\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u653f\u5e9c\u7684\u5927\u529b\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\uff0c\u7814\u53d1\u51fa\u5e2e\u52a9\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u627e\u5230\u88ab\u62d0\u5356\u513f\u7ae5\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u4e0e\u65b0\u7586\u6709\u5173\u90e8\u95e8\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u6240\u6709\u5c45\u6c11\u7684\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u3002 Jonathan Browning for The New York Times\n\n\u201c\u6211\u4eec\u53ea\u5b58\u50a8\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89c4\u5b9a\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u201d\u4ed6\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89c4\u5b9a\u5b58\u591a\u4e45\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c31\u5b58\u591a\u4e45\u3002\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89c4\u5b9a\u5b58\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c31\u5b58\u4ec0\u4e48\u3002\u201d", "Others say that the term comes from \u201cmenteri,\u201d the Malay for \u201ccourt councilor\u201d or \u201cminister,\u201d and that the 16th-century Portuguese who used Malaysia as a steppingstone into China wrote it as \u201cMandarin.\u201d\n\nThe little duck in Central Park has been solo, but in China, its cousins are believed to be lifelong couples.

He was 62.\n\nHis son Micah, who confirmed the death, said the cause was hypertensive heart failure. Mr. Pickerell had been attending WhiskyFest San Francisco, an event that lets consumers taste whiskeys from around the world.\n\nMr. Pickerell was a burly former college football player who liked to tell stories and dressed in costumes for marketing events. But he was also a well-educated chemical engineer who enforced high quality standards in distilling whiskey, whether at a major company like Maker\u2019s Mark or at small operations like Nelson\u2019s Green Brier Distillery, which makes bourbon and Tennessee whiskey.\n\nHe was once nicknamed the Johnny Appleseed of American whiskey for having his hand in myriad brands, and for advocating for the production of higher-priced premium whiskeys.", "The show\u2019s curator, Rebecca Zorach, said she saw the exhibition, which she started working on five years ago, as an opportunity to belatedly give South Side artists the wider recognition they deserve. \u201cThe Time Is Now!\u201d is part of a series called South Side Stories, which is backed by a grant from the Terra Foundation\u2019s Art Design Chicago, a joint effort of more than 60 organizations with over 25 exhibitions and hundreds of public programs in the city. (The Terra Foundation is a privately run nonprofit that supports art exhibitions and projects.)\n\n\u201cIt started as a broad survey of the South Side but then inescapable themes emerged like politics, unity, struggle, displacement, gentrification, and we decided to start focus on some of those,\u201d Ms. Zorach said.\n\nThe Smart has been on the South Side since 1974, but its new director, Alison Gass, arrived at the museum last year and said she was determined to show the work of artists from a range of backgrounds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re humbled to work with these artists who have been excluded from the canon and haven\u2019t gotten their due,\u201d Ms. Gass said. \u201cWe are course-correcting.\u201d\n\nThe Smart\u2019s efforts go beyond a handful of exhibitions.

In truth, it\u2019s just the easiest way to protect the balance of power in Washington. But by trying to meet a corrupt Republican Party halfway, instead of taking clear stands for what\u2019s right, they have failed to define the party and failed to protect their constituents.\n\nWe see the same approach on impeachment: As a way to delay making a decision, Democratic leaders have insisted on waiting for the special counsel, Robert Mueller, to deliver his report. But now the investigation is at risk, because Mr. Whitaker could prevent the special counsel\u2019s team from reaching a just conclusion or even releasing its findings to the public.\n\nThe current, Republican-led Congress could have already taken action to shield Mr. Mueller or to put Mr. Trump in check. It still can. If it does not, House Democrats must prepare subpoenas, to be issued as soon as they take over, to ensure that the public learns the truth uncovered by the special counsel, and call on his team to testify under oath in public hearings.\n\nShould the establishment refuse to give up conventional orthodoxy and take up impeachment proceedings when the new Congress convenes, freshmen members \u2014 many of whom ran and won because of their promise to stand up to the president \u2014 must challenge the establishment and demand a say over the agenda. An overwhelming majority of people in this country elected them to hold this president accountable. There is no majority without them. That means no one has the votes for a leadership title without their support.\n\nAt a moment when just one-third of all Americans trust their government to do what is right, winning a majority has to mean much more than just frustrating Republican legislative goals and scoring debating points. Democrats must stand up for the safety of the American people and our entire democratic system.\n\nWe cannot allow this to be an argument about what Republicans will permit \u2014 it\u2019s about demanding the truth and protecting the foundations of our free society.

She wrote: \u201cThere are other incidents which plagued my reading with doubt, identified in other reviews as \u2018unbelievable\u2019 and as \u2018an accumulation of implausible details [which] gnaws at reality\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn reality, life at Auschwitz was a cataclysmic zero-sum game. The Sokolov of the novel is an anxious but rather noble hero, who helps many of his fellow prisoners. In his 1996 interview, he comes across as an immensely likable opportunist, whose genius seemed to be finding every angle in any situation. There\u2019s no doubt he really helped many prisoners. He also said he traded black market goods with many guards and his commandant. \u201cI was close to the top brass in the SS,\u201d he said frankly. \u201cBut no one in the camp knew about it.\u201d", "Travis Huggett thought of the subway as a means of getting from one place to another. Then he had a son on the autism spectrum.\n\nTo Orson, now 9, a train was something more than transportation. It was soothing, endlessly fascinating, more intriguing than any destination it might reach. At his school for children with autism, other boys shared the same passion. When Mr. Huggett started photographing some of them, asking them about their interest in trains, he discovered how many different ways they were drawn.\n\n\u201cSome were really interested in maps and timetables,\u201d Mr. Huggett said. Some liked model trains more than the real thing. Some found crowded cars too stimulating, but one wanted even more stimulation: his idea was to ride the subway to Coney Island and then ride the Cyclone roller coaster. \u201cIt was incredible how different they all are,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned a lot about how diverse the community is.\u201d", "Flynn grew up in Kansas City, Mo., to parents who make a lot of sense. Her mother was a reading-comprehension professor at the local community college. Her father was a film professor at the same school, and the movies he took her to see before age 10 were rarely, in her words, \u201cprincess-led\u201d: \u201cThe Great Santini,\u201d \u201cAlien,\u201d \u201cThe Elephant Man.\u201d After college at the University of Kansas, Flynn moved to California, planning to establish residency and apply to Berkeley to get a graduate degree in English. In the meantime, she found a job working at a trade magazine for human-resources professionals based in Orange County. When it came time to apply for graduate school, she went to Northwestern for a journalism degree instead, and from there moved to New York. She got a job at Entertainment Weekly, where she worked for 10 years, serving as both the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d beat writer and the television critic. She was able to move back to Chicago, a city she felt was \u201cher place,\u201d and keep the job, until she was laid off in 2008, not long before her second novel was to be published.\n\nShe went for a depressing meal at a diner called the Hollywood Caf\u00e9 and briefly wondered if she\u2019d have to respond to the Help Wanted sign in the window. She\u2019d been a waitress before, she reasoned; she could do it again. But she\u2019d already written two novels, and her time as a journalist had instilled in her a helpful work ethic and lack of preciousness: She could write fast, under pressure.\n\nThough she didn\u2019t have an idea for a new novel when she got laid off, she decided to use her severance to work out the first chapter of \u201cGone Girl.\u201d She sold the book on the strength of those pages, not expecting that it would go on to become a massive hit \u2014 just as a reactive mode of feminist critique was starting to shape online discourse. Headlines like \u201cIs \u2018Gone Girl\u2019 Feminist or Misogynist?\u201d and \u201cHow \u2018Gone Girl\u2019 Is Misogynistic Literature\u201d gave way to editorials outlining Flynn\u2019s transgressions against women: though, of course, not all female characters must be likable, none of hers were, except maybe Amy\u2019s sister-in-law, Go, who nevertheless has what one writer deemed stereotypical \u201cdaddy issues.\u201d Amy was seen to fortify all sorts of harmful clich\u00e9s about women, particularly for the craven way she falsifies a rape allegation, but also because she\u2019s superannoying.\n\nThe book is told in his-and-hers alternating viewpoints, and at first Amy\u2019s side of the story comes in the form of grating diary entries written in the semi-ironic, overadjectived voice of a young person trying to conceal that she really wants to be a writer but is too in love with how clever she is to manage it. In fact, she is a 38-year-old woman who only recently lost most of her trust fund because her parents \u2014 rich off a long-running series of children\u2019s books called \u201cAmazing Amy\u201d \u2014 overspent. She lies about everything, which we know because she tells us, smugly. Though her husband, Nick, is not innocent of the crimes of lying and of writerly obnoxiousness (they\u2019re both writers, sort of), he\u2019s at least self-hating and working class. Given the choice, Amy is not the one you would rather hang out with.\n\nThe question that spawned a thousand think pieces is whether Amy\u2019s overbearing, sociopathic self-awareness was an intentional artistic choice, and therefore whether Flynn is reflecting the pressures of patriarchy or blindly perpetuating them. This is further complicated by the fact that the diaries are later revealed to have been fabricated by Amy as evidence of Nick\u2019s abuse, which could be read as either another point for \u201csexist portrayal of women as crazy liars\u201d or for \u201ca capable woman, driven to extremes by the patriarchy, is establishing her agency, and in a really messed-up way becoming the writer she\u2019s always dreamed of being.\u201d\n\nFlynn\u2019s response to these questions is refreshingly pragmatic: She wrote a character, and she wanted to see what that character would do under certain conditions. Still, the furor upset her. Though she has always been aware of feminism in general, and identifies as a feminist, she says she could be better versed in feminist theory, and was blindsided by the occasionally vitriolic accusations of misogyny she faced. No, most women don\u2019t falsify rape claims, she says, but most women also don\u2019t frame their cheating husbands for their own murders. Flynn remembers one negative review in particular \u2014 of the movie adaptation, directed by David Fincher \u2014 which she paraphrased for me: \u201cIt ended by saying that Fincher and I had found in each other evil soul twins of death, that we were riding off into the sunset into hell and that on the back of our car it said, \u2018Just Married.\u2019 \u201d Reading it made her wonder, only half-jokingly, if she\u2019d \u201ckilled\u201d feminism.\n\nFlynn drives a cherry red Jeep Wrangler Rubicon convertible, which is a little dirty, the floor inside covered in dead leaves. The day after I visited her office, she suggested we drive to her old Chicago neighborhood, Ukrainian Village, to recreate the daily \u201cwalk of woe\u201d she took while writing \u201cGone Girl.\u201d \u201cGirls\u2019 trip!\u201d she said, in a sardonic imitation of a Valley Girl accent, as she got in the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about female empowerment!\u201d As we pulled out of her garage, she dropped the ironic act to earnestly make sure I had sunscreen; the top was liberatingly down.", "\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff1abait-and-switch \u8bf1\u8d2d\u3001\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8f6c\u5411\n\n\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u603b\u90e8\u4f1a\u843d\u811a\u4e39\u4f5b\u5417\uff1f\u8fd8\u662f\u4e9a\u7279\u5170\u5927\uff1f\u80af\u5b9a\u662f\u829d\u52a0\u54e5\u5427\uff1f\n\n\u6279\u8bc4\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u8086\u5ba3\u4f20\u201c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u603b\u90e8\u201d\u6765\u6269\u5927\u5176\u5546\u4e1a\u5229\u76ca\u3002\u8fd9\u573a\u582a\u6bd4\u9009\u7f8e\u5927\u8d5b\u7684\u9009\u5740\u6d3b\u52a8\u662f\u4e00\u573a\u76db\u5927\u7684\u516c\u5173\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u54c1\u724c\u5e26\u6765\u66dd\u5149\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u8fd8\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u57fa\u5efa\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u7528\u6237\u652f\u4ed8\u4fe1\u606f\u2014\u2014\u6beb\u65e0\u7591\u95ee\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u62d3\u5c55\u3002\n\n", "Nearly 11,000 years ago, a man died in what is now Nevada.

The findings lend astonishing detail to a story once lost to prehistory: how and when humans spread across the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe earliest known arrivals from Asia were already splitting into recognizably distinct groups, the research suggests. Some of these populations thrived, becoming the ancestors of indigenous peoples throughout the hemisphere.\n\nBut other groups died out entirely, leaving no trace save for what can be discerned in ancient DNA.

It was held at the same time as another big event: a six-day import expo in Shanghai aimed at showing China as a big buyer of foreign goods. With American tariffs threatening to slow a weakening Chinese economy, the country\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, spoke at the expo on Monday to proclaim that China could be a positive force in global trade.\n\nAt Wuzhen, by contrast, Mr. Xi appeared only by proxy. The head of the Communist Party\u2019s propaganda department, Huang Kunming, conveyed a message of thanks from Mr. Xi and then delivered an opening address that extolled the world-changing power of internet access.\n\nEmissaries from Silicon Valley were also in short supply. Last year, the speakers at Wuzhen included Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, as well as Sundar Pichai of Google. This year, the sole Western tech executive to give a keynote address was Steve Mollenkopf, the chief executive of the chip maker Qualcomm.\n\nHis appearance served as a reminder of American companies\u2019 continuing travails in China, which could deepen as the two powers wrestle over high-tech supremacy.

Mr. Whitaker has said publicly, on multiple occasions, that the Mueller investigation was close to crossing a red line and should be curtailed. He has also defended Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s taking a meeting with Russians who offered to provide dirt about Hillary Clinton. Ethical standards would mandate that Mr. Whitaker recuse himself from any role in overseeing the Mueller investigation.\n\nThat is not going to happen. While Mr. Whitaker may be foreclosed by law from firing Mr. Mueller without good cause, he is likely to claim falsely the existence of such cause. Alternatively, Mr. Whitaker will move to impede Mr. Mueller and ensure that his findings never see the light of day.\n\nThe response to this unfolding outrage must be immediate and robust. Congress must enact protective legislation. The soon-to-be chairmen of the House Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee should instruct Mr. Mueller to deliver his findings to their committees.

To deny press credentials to a well-known, legitimate reporter for no other reason than that the president doesn\u2019t like his questions is unprecedented in the United States and reveals the autocratic intentions of this president.\n\nThis action must not pass unnoticed in the chaotic swirl of events unleashed by President Trump.

The Times and other mainstream media should all turn in their White House press credentials and refuse to enter the White House until Jim Acosta\u2019s credentials are restored.

She reveals herself as hurt and humiliated and devastated in characteristically electric prose: \u201cHe told me the truth about the femme fatale, which freed my knowledge to sit about in the light of day, like an object, to be coped with, not hid like some hair monster. And I didn\u2019t die.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThe letters to Beuscher are moving and revelatory because they add a dimension to the hard, brilliant, glittering fury of the late poems. We are familiar with Plath\u2019s fierceness, the power of her imagination to exact revenge, to correct humiliations, to create dark drama out of despair. But we are notably less familiar with the Plath of these letters, trying so hard to steady herself, to gain perspective, to find her way toward the independence and health she could so clearly make out, just in the distance.\n\nThe decline of her marriage and her subsequent breakdown have been subject to so much projection and politicizing that it is an enormous contribution to see the poet tackle these events in her own words. These letters take the grand archetype of suicidal Plath, the elaborate, brittle mythologies that have sprung up around her, and give them an unforgettable human specificity. What has been missing from the biographical record of the final months is Plath\u2019s own voice.\n\nThe saddest thing to watch is how hard she was working to get better. Beuscher advised her not to imagine that she couldn\u2019t exist without Hughes: \u201cFirst, middle and last, do not give up your personal one-ness.\u201d She warns her not to imagine that her entire life hinges on one particular man. Plath was trying to make her way to the doctor\u2019s words. \u201cThe part about keeping my personal one-ness is a real help. I must. But my god I can\u2019t see to thinking straight.\u201d\n\nWhat comes across so clearly and heartbreakingly in these letters is how hard she is trying. She is actively engaged in the intellectual work of getting better. Beuscher recommends Erich Fromm to her, and she reads and stars a passage: \u201cI have finally read the Fromm & think that I have been guilty of what he calls \u2018Idolatrous love,\u2019 that I lost myself in Ted instead of finding myself.\u201d\n\nShe wanted so badly to be able to see a life without Hughes, to be able to inhabit it. She could almost see it. She writes to Beuscher, \u201cIf I could study, read, enjoy people on my own, Ted\u2019s leaving would be hard, but manageable.\u201d Seven days later, she was dead.", "I know a family who regularly skinny-dip in the Atlantic after the sun has set. I also know a family who live in a gated community, in a house stocked with more guns than they have hands to fire their guns.

When Monster\u2019s powers begin to fail, Tiger steps up, taking on a nightmare by denouncing its reality. But real or not, nightmares affect us, and so the true victory in Tetri\u2019s book comes in unlikely collaborations and creativity in the face of terror. It comes from befriending a \u201cmonster.\u201d\n\nWhich makes me wonder, how can we stop fear before it ever blooms?

Abrams, who likes to think of his stories as \u201cmystery boxes\u201d \u2014 but let\u2019s just say that there are unidentifiable carcasses strewn in the forest, shadowy characters kept behind closed doors and a Nazi doctor who seems eager for freshly executed bodies.\n\nThe idea of merging a World War II adventure with supernatural elements is certainly nothing new; examples abound, from \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d to \u201cThe Keep\u201d to (sort of) the zombie thriller \u201cDead Snow.\u201d At times \u201cOverlord\u201d recalls these movies, and it also seems to be aware that its ostensibly twisty premise is actually fairly predictable: The film doesn\u2019t try to surprise us with narrative revelations so much as it tries to jolt us with gore.\n\nThat results in a curiously undernourished story that at times feels like it\u2019s setting up mysteries and subplots that never quite go anywhere. Nevertheless, as seen in the film\u2019s terrifying opening and its gruesome climax, Avery deftly orchestrates some grisly, intense set pieces. He delivers on the thrills, even if the story leaves something to be desired.", "The Allard J2 and J2X, rakish British sports cars stuffed with high-performance American V-8 engines, terrorized racetracks on both sides of the Atlantic from 1949 into the 1950s. Memories of the marque have faded with time, but it was a precursor to the hugely popular AC Cobra designed by Carroll Shelby.\n\nModern versions of the Allard J2X, made by a man named Roger Allard, are now cruising American roads, but they\u2019re rare sights, because few have been made, and many of their owners don\u2019t drive them often.\n\nThis would be a heartwarming story of family perseverance were it not for one fact: Mr. Allard, 72, is Canadian, and no relation to Sydney Allard, the British racer who produced the original J2X and other fast cars (and who died in 1966). In fact, Sydney Allard\u2019s descendants are working to produce their own cars, and they take exception to Roger Allard\u2019s creations.\n\nRoger Allard\u2019s path to building Allard cars is the result of a happy accident. A plan to buy an Austin-Healey 3000 when he was 50 fell through when the owner crashed it on the night before delivery, Mr. Allard said. On a vacation to England in 1995, he visited a car show and started leafing through literature at one stall.

Gymnastics, according to the Olympic committee, which had also grown increasingly alarmed by turmoil in the management of the federation.\n\nAlthough it is not clear whether the discovery of the documents points to somebody trying to hide them, Olympic committee officials said they decided they could not abide that possibility leading to more turbulence in a popular and successful sport consisting of thousands of athletes, including Olympians, looking for new direction.\n\nThe investigators consider the documents central to an investigation into the gymnastics national team doctor Lawrence G.

Immediately, feet alight on alien terrain, ears channel novel sounds and noses breathe in unfamiliar scents.

Immer wenn mir meine Emotionen zusetzen, nahm ich mir die Tabelle vor und f\u00fcgte eine neue Zeile oder Spalte hinzu und verlor mich in Tagtr\u00e4umen von endlosen Stra\u00dfen.\n\nAlles in allem w\u00fcrde unsere Route durch 17 Bundesstaaten f\u00fchren und knapp 10.000 km lang sein.

Es war ein unglaubliches Abenteuer.\n\nJeder von uns hatte seine Lieblingserlebnisse. Die Sonnenfinsternis, die wir durch die d\u00fcnnen Wolken \u00fcber dem Cosmo Park in Columbia, Missouri, sehen konnten, war atemberaubend. Trotz meiner H\u00f6henangst haben mich vor allem der hoch aufragende Devils Tower und der Gateway Arch beeindruckt. Meine Frau genoss besonders die Nacht, die wir im Park Inn von Mason City verbrachten, dem letzten noch existierenden Hotel, das von Frank Lloyd Wright entworfen wurde. Das einstimmige Highlight f\u00fcr die Jungen war das Asheville Pinball Museum, wo man f\u00fcr 15 Dollar (12 Dollar f\u00fcr Kinder) unbegrenzt oft an Dutzenden von historischen Pinball- und Arcade-Automaten spielen kann.\n\nAuf der gesamten Tour sammelten unsere S\u00f6hne Andenken: Von dreckigen Kronkorken bis hin zu den beliebten Junior-Ranger-Abzeichen, die man in Nationalparks, Museen und Gedenkst\u00e4tten erwerben kann. (Unser \u00e4lterer Sohn hatte gerade die vierte Klasse abgeschlossen, so dass diese Besuche im Rahmen des Programms \u201eEvery Kid in a Park\u201c f\u00fcr ihn kostenlos waren.) Nach dem Ausf\u00fcllen eines Aktivit\u00e4ten-B\u00fcchleins wurden sie vom Park-Ranger feierlich mit einem kleinen Plastikabzeichen dekoriert. Sie sammelten auf der gesamten Reise jeweils 17 Abzeichen, darunter ein spezielles \u201cSonnenfinsternis-Forscher\u201d-Abzeichen, auf das beide besonders stolz waren.\n\nDoch ein zerm\u00fcrbend langer Tag in Charleston, South Carolina, - \u201cWir k\u00f6nnen hier drei Abzeichen bekommen!\u201d - verpasste unserer Jagd auf Abzeichen einen D\u00e4mpfer. Fort Sumter war beeindruckend und Fort Moutrie auch recht interessant. Doch als ich dabei helfen sollte, noch ein weiteres Wortr\u00e4tsel auf der Veranda des historischen, aber relativ unspektakul\u00e4ren Charles Pinckney National Historic Site auszuf\u00fcllen, schwor ich, nie wieder nur wegen eines Abzeichens in einem Nationalpark Halt zu machen.\n\nNat\u00fcrlich gab es ein paar Orte, die den Kindern weniger Spa\u00df machten.

It\u2019s illegal. And it means that anything Mr. Whitaker does, or tries to do, in that position is invalid.\n\nMuch of the commentary about Mr. Whitaker\u2019s appointment has focused on all sorts of technical points about the Vacancies Reform Act and Justice Department succession statutes. But the flaw in the appointment of Mr. Whitaker, who was Mr. Sessions\u2019s chief of staff at the Justice Department, runs much deeper. It defies one of the explicit checks and balances set out in the Constitution, a provision designed to protect us all against the centralization of government power.\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe us, then take it from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, whom Mr. Trump once called his \u201cfavorite\u201d sitting justice. Last year, the Supreme Court examined the question of whether the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board had been lawfully appointed to his job without Senate confirmation. The Supreme Court held the appointment invalid on a statutory ground.\n\nJustice Thomas agreed with the judgment, but wrote separately to emphasize that even if the statute had allowed the appointment, the Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause would not have. The officer in question was a principal officer, he concluded. And the public interest protected by the Appointments Clause was a critical one: The Constitution\u2019s drafters, Justice Thomas argued, \u201crecognized the serious risk for abuse and corruption posed by permitting one person to fill every office in the government.\u201d Which is why, he pointed out, the framers provided for advice and consent of the Senate.\n\nWhat goes for a mere lawyer at the N.L.R.B. goes in spades for the attorney general of the United States, the head of the Justice Department and one of the most important people in the federal government. It is one thing to appoint an acting underling, like an acting solicitor general, a post one of us held.

Ms. Abrams has not conceded, and The Associated Press and other major news organizations say the race is still too close to call.\n\nMr. Kemp attracted mounting criticism during the campaign for his management of an election in which he was also a candidate, but he had dismissed repeated calls from Democrats for him to resign in the weeks before Election Day.\n\nMr. Kemp made no mention of the elections process on Thursday in his resignation letter to the outgoing Republican governor, Nathan Deal, saying he was resigning because he wished \u201cto focus on the transition to my gubernatorial administration.\u201d", "Winning against the Cardinals (2-5) should be easy enough \u2014 even if Mahomes somehow doesn\u2019t break Dawson\u2019s record \u2014 but Las Vegas is very likely underrating Arizona\u2019s recent improvement with such an enormous point spread. Pick: Cardinals +16.5\n\nLions at Bears, 1 p.m., Fox\n\nThe Bears (5-3) may have had their best defensive effort of the season last week, and they did it without Khalil Mack, the superstar linebacker who sat out for a second straight week. Now Chicago gets Mack back for an N.F.C. North showdown with the Lions (3-5). A division title is in the Bears\u2019 reach if they can keep plugging away, and if Mack is truly back to full-strength, Detroit should be little more than a speed bump. Pick: Bears -6.5\n\nFalcons at Browns, 1 p.m., Fox\n\nEnding an epic losing streak was nice, but a few wins early in the season created some unrealistic expectations for where the Browns (2-6-1) are as a team. That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t room for optimism. Denzel Ward has been fantastic, Baker Mayfield has had his moments, and there is a very young and very talented core to the team. But they are still a team that is rightly an underdog at home, especially against a team like the Falcons (4-4) that can attack Cleveland\u2019s defense in several different ways to find the holes that are invariably created by a lack of overall depth. Pick: Falcons -4\n\nPatriots at Titans, 1 p.m., CBS\n\nThe hallmark of a mixed-bag season for the Titans (4-4) under first-year Coach Mike Vrabel has been the team imposing its style of play on their opponents, slowing things down and keeping the score low on both sides. They have not scored more than 28 points and they have not allowed more than 27. Now Vrabel, a longtime star for the Patriots (7-2) will be going up against his former team, and Coach Bill Belichick, a man who largely influenced that grinding style of play. If anyone can avoid falling into Vrabel\u2019s traps, it\u2019s Belichick.

Then it raced up alongside, getting perilously close. For a few tense minutes, a collision seemed imminent.\n\nThe American vessel, the Decatur, blasted its whistle. The Chinese took no notice. Instead, the crew prepared to throw overboard large, shock-absorbing fenders to protect their ship.

Mr. Pichai attended, but not Google\u2019s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who sometimes appear at staff meetings.\n\nThe meeting lasted over an hour, the people said. Some workers asked why contractors did not get the same protection from harassment as full-time employees. In an answer to another question about how to change Google\u2019s executive culture, Urs H\u00f6lzle, a senior vice president and one of the earliest employees, urged staff members to view executives as individuals and not as one group, the people said.\n\nAnother employee said Mr. Pichai also seemed dismissive of the idea of an employee representative on the board.

(Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $26.) WELCOME HOME: A Memoir With Selected Photographs and Letters, by Lucia Berlin. Edited and with a foreword by Jeff Berlin. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25.) The revival of the work of Lucia Berlin (1936-2004), which began in earnest with \u201cA Manual for Cleaning Women,\u201d an important selection of her stories that appeared in 2015, continues with another collection of stories along with and uncompleted memoir and some personal correspondence. \u201cOne thing that makes Berlin so valuable is her gift for evoking the sweetness and earnestness of young women who fall in love,\u201d our critic Dwight Garner writes, \u201cand then catching them at that moment when things begin to turn, when the trees of their being are forced to grow bark.\u201d\n\nI AM DYNAMITE! A Life of Nietzsche, by Sue Prideaux. (Tim Duggan Books, $30.) In this biography, Nietzsche steps out of the mists of obfuscation and rumor. Prideaux draws her subject into focus by examining the events in his life, his personal writing and his published work. \u201cTo see Nietzsche, it seems helpful to have binocular vision that can accommodate the sublime and the ridiculous. His was a life of prodigious work and self-sacrifice but also profound blundering,\u201d our critic Parul Sehgal writes. \u201cFreud said that of all men only Nietzsche truly knew himself, and his letters can be wildly funny and full of comic set pieces.

The police have recommended criminal bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges against Mr. Netanyahu in two other corruption investigations.\n\nThe police said they had sufficient evidence to charge David Shimron, a second cousin of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s as well as his personal lawyer, with bribery and money laundering.\n\nMr. Shimron, they said, had exploited his \u201cstatus and closeness to the prime minister\u201d to promote the submarine purchase on behalf of Michael Ganor, an Israeli agent working for ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, the shipyard that build the vessels. In exchange, Mr. Shimron was paid a \u201creward for success\u201d of nearly $75,000 for \u201copening doors\u201d and influencing officials in favor of the deal, the police said.

Most range from roughly 7 to 9 percent alcohol, much less than the typical 12 to 14 percent of wine, for those concerned with overdoing it.\n\nOver in the Hudson Valley , nobody doubts the suitability of the region to apples. Mr. Soons, whose family has grown apples for more than a century, believes it is among the best regions in the country for the fruit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the nature of the soils,\u201d he said, \u201cvery old, very rocky, decent natural pH and drainage. Apples like them, and the climate is right.\u201d\n\nMost apples, at least. Over the last few years, Mr. Soons has added almost five acres of English cider apples, which, as he and others have learned, are not so well adapted to the Hudson Valley. They are particularly susceptible to fire blight, a withering bacterial disease.\n\nWith the English apples they were able to harvest in 2017, Orchard Hill made Bitters and Sharps, which is still aging at the cidery, but is taut, tart and lip-smacking, with great freshness and energy. Another cider, Gold Label, is gently sweet but well-balanced and refreshing. Orchard Hill also makes Ten66 Pommeau, a blend of apple brandy and juice that tastes like a buttery caramel apple. Mixed with tonic, it would make a fine Thanksgiving aperitif.\n\nMr. Morgenthau at Fishkill Farms and Treasury Cider, too, has faced challenges growing European cider apples. When he returned to his family farm in 2008 with a degree in fine arts, he had intended to practice landscape painting. Instead, he fell in love with farming and apples.\n\nFishkill was purchased in 1913 by his grandfather Henry Morgenthau Jr., who went on to serve as Treasury secretary under President Franklin D.

His son Robert Morgenthau kept the farm going even as he served from 1975 until 2009 as district attorney in Manhattan, and his son Josh Morgenthau is now in charge.", "Alarm, grief and determination also shape the story, its relative lulls (with family and friends) followed by organizing and spasms of violence and so on. It opens with Robert and the other Scottish nobles \u2014 once led by an unseen William Wallace \u2014 licking their wounds, having recently been routed by the English. The enemy invaders in turn are led by King Edward (the characteristically excellent Stephen Dillane), a ruler whose perpetual disdain for the rest of humanity periodically swerves into disgust. In other words, \u201cOutlaw King\u201d more or less picks up where Mel Gibson\u2019s \u201cBraveheart\u201d left off; to that end, Wallace\u2019s legend and one of his body parts put in appearances here.\n\nRobert and the other nobles make uneasy peace with Edward but are shortly pushed back into violent rebellion, which is where Mackenzie seems happiest to have them. There are periodic cutaways, including to Robert\u2019s new English bride, Elizabeth (the appealing Florence Pugh), whom Edward marries off for diplomatic reasons. Pugh helps elevate this thin character, furnishing Elizabeth with enough of an inner life that you, like Robert, miss her whenever they separate. The attempts to invest Elizabeth with a little overly modern-sounding feminist resolve fall short, though, and are reminders that historical fiction rarely knows what to do with the little ladies left at home.\n\nMackenzie does nice, tight work now and again, mostly in more intimate sequences, but too many scenes drag, and his fetishistization of violence proves numbing. In one, a gutted, dying man\u2019s entrails spill to the ground; in another, screaming horses and men are impaled on spikes. It\u2019s telling that while the story turns on nationalism, the movie feels untethered from life. It takes the Scottish desire for sovereignty for granted (also: the English are greedy and pathologically sadistic).

They had their blood pressure measured on two occasions at the start and were followed for an average of 19 years. Over the period, there were 228 instances of coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure or peripheral artery disease.\n\nAbout half the group had normal blood pressure of 120/80 or lower. Compared with them, those with elevated pressure \u2014 120-129/80 or higher \u2014 were 67 percent more likely to have had cardiovascular problems. People with readings of 130-139/80-89 had a 75 percent increased risk, and those with readings above 140/90 were three and a half times as likely to have some type of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe lead author, Dr. Yuichiro Yano, an assistant professor of community and family medicine at Duke, said that a young person with elevated blood pressure should pursue heart-healthy measures, especially weight control.", "Yesterday, all of Google\u2019s vice presidents met, and today, the company will deliver some answers.

Global offices can call in at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. According to a just-released letter to employees from Sundar Pichai, the Google chief executive, that I obtained, Google will meet many of the protesters\u2019 demands.\n\nThose protesters had a long list, which included: An end to forced arbitration when filing a sexual harassment allegation, which has become a tool to suppress the accuser instead of protecting him or her; equality in pay and opportunity, which, by giving a wider range of people money and power, would help stop these kind of abuses; a public report on sexual harassment (news flash: sometimes shame is a perfectly fine motivator of good behavior); a uniform process for reporting sexual harassment charges in offices worldwide, which would prevent a piecemeal approach from hindering best practices; a chief diversity officer who reports to the chief executive officer, because clout comes with access; and creating an employee representative to the board, which seems like the smartest idea of all.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that we have not always gotten everything right in the past and we are sincerely sorry for that,\u201d Mr. Pichai wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s clear we need to make some changes.\u201d His letter said that arbitration will no longer be mandatory, announced improvements to sexual harassment reporting and training, and emphasized the company\u2019s commitment to diversity.\n\nIt\u2019s just unfortunate that it took a public protest by its employees for the company to move these issues to the front burner. Google shouldn\u2019t stop here. Next, and perhaps more painfully, all the executives who paid off their colleagues or let them off the hook should explain in detail to employees how that happened. That would include releasing all pertinent emails and other communications to help figure out how these decisions were made. While some think such disclosures are legally problematic, truth and reconciliation is the first step to true change. One of Silicon Valley\u2019s worst characteristics is an inability to reflect on itself. This is part of its laudable proclivity to push forward, but in this case, looking back is the best way to move ahead.\n\nFinally, these issues aren\u2019t limited to Google, and the company now has a chance to become a real leader of changes across tech and all of business. Imagine if it took the tens of millions of dollars it had given to each of the problematic executives and instead handed it over to a range of public advocacy organizations that could hold companies like Google to account.", "Sometimes it seems as if we\u2019re living under a constant barrage of heavy news.

Nobody would argue that the news media is infallible, and that, in the terrible polarization of American society, news reporters would feel targeted for attack for doing their jobs. Mr. Acosta, for one, has been outspoken in his frustration with the White House press operation.\n\nBut it is Mr. Trump, with his incessant demonization of \u201cfake news\u201d and inflammatory characterization of news organizations as the \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d who has systematically and dangerously done everything in his power to undermine a free and independent press. That someone like Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who surely knows better, joins in bashing the press underscores the effectiveness of Mr. Trump\u2019s poison.\n\nMr. Trump would no doubt prefer that every member of the White House press corps be like Sean Hannity or Jeanine Pirro, the Fox News personalities who happily joined the president onstage at his last pre-election campaign rally in Missouri on Monday. Mr. Hannity has long been an unapologetic booster of Mr. Trump, but even his colleagues and managers at Fox were aghast at his participation in the rally, at which he went so far as to join in attacking \u201cfake news\u201d reporters at the back of the room, among whom was a Fox News White House correspondent, Kristin Fisher.\n\nMr. Trump is not likely to temper his rhetoric. But those he listens to, including Ms. Sanders, Senator Graham and the executives at Fox News, should try to impress on him the danger of confounding loyalty to Donald Trump with loyalty to the Constitution and to democracy.\n\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.", "NEWBURY PARK, Calif. \u2014 In photos that Ian D. Long\u2019s mother proudly posted to Facebook, her son is a young Marine: smiling, crew-cut, in a crisp uniform. When he opened fire in a crowded bar late on Wednesday, killing 12 people, his face was covered and he was dressed in black. He was armed with smoke grenades and a high-capacity magazine for his pistol, and was full of an inexplicable rage.\n\nWhat changed Mr. Long has this Southern California community scrambling for answers. The authorities said they suspected that he might have had post traumatic stress after a deployment in Afghanistan but was ultimately determined to have posed no threat. Neighbors said he was a solitary figure who lived with his mother, and often clashed with her.\n\n[What stereotypes do you see around veterans and PTSD?]\n\nAs news of the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, Calif., spread to his former battalion, shocked veterans wondered if the troubles that led their fellow Marine to kill innocent civilians in a crowded bar had resided in him before the military, or if he had brought them home from war.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised someone I knew ended up doing a mass shooting. We had another guy recently committed suicide by cops in Texas,\u201d said Sam Tanner, who served with Mr. Long and described him as a friend. \u201cGuys struggle.

During deranged monologues, the president \u2014 a liberal Democrat named Mark Hollenbach \u2014 rants about his perceived political enemies and imaginary plots against him. He rails against the media and accuses a newspaper columnist of leading a \u201cconspiracy\u201d to discredit him. He tries to undo America\u2019s longstanding alliances with Western Europe, and arranges \u201ca high-level conference with the Soviet Premiere that could damage our national security,\u201d according to The New York Times review. (Bizarrely, there\u2019s even a Supreme Court justice in the novel whose last name is Cavanaugh.)\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether \u201cNight of Camp David\u201d will attract political junkies who have been obsessively following the real-life political melodrama unfolding daily in Washington. Two of this year\u2019s biggest blockbusters \u2014 \u201cFear\u201d by Bob Woodward and \u201cFire and Fury\u201d by Michael Wolff \u2014 offered blistering insider accounts of the drama and dysfunction in the Trump White House, and have sold millions of copies. But as readers have been glued to the nonstop political news cycle, interest in fiction seems to have flagged, while nonfiction sales have surged.\n\nThere have been some notable exceptions. \u201cThe President Is Missing,\u201d a novel about a fictional president that was written by Bill Clinton and James Patterson, has sold more than a million copies. But other works of political fiction have fallen flat, perhaps because the genre has limited appeal at a moment when the headlines are often more dramatic than anything a screenwriter or novelist could dream up.\n\nA handful of novelists have written fictional critiques of Trump, mostly with disappointing commercial results. Howard Jacobson published a satirical political allegory about a vain, vulgar prince that fell flat with critics and readers. (The Guardian said Jacobson \u201cmisses his punches.\u201d) Last month, an anonymous author published a thriller titled \u201cThe Kingfisher Secret,\u201d about an American tycoon who is about to become president of the United States, and has secret ties to the Russian government. Despite its ripped-from-the-headlines premise, or maybe because of it, \u201cThe Kingfisher Secret\u201d was panned by some critics as a poor substitute for the actual news: \u201cAdmittedly, the confirmed and speculative details of the president\u2019s malfeasant career are hard for fiction to match, but this plot doesn\u2019t exert itself any more than Donald Trump lumbering around his golf course,\u201d Ron Charles wrote in The Washington Post.\n\nLast year, Jonathan Freedland, a columnist for The Guardian, published a novel under a pen name about a moody and impulsive American president who brings the country to the brink of nuclear war with North Korea and emboldens white supremacists by stoking racial fears. The novel, \u201cTo Kill a President,\u201d which also wrestled with the question of how to remove an unfit president from office, was apparently too plausible for some: \u201cGot a bit fed up with it about three-quarters through. A little bit too close to reality,\u201d one reader wrote on Amazon.\n\nSome felt similarly about \u201cNight of Camp David\u201d when it first came out. (A Times critic complained that it was too realistic, writing that \u201cas a suspense novel it is probably a great deal too honest for its own good.\u201d) But many readers were riveted: The book spent 18 weeks on the best-seller list in hardcover.", "There is comedy, and then there is dark comedy, and then there is Julia Davis\u2019s comedy.\n\nThe British actress creates and stars in series in which people are either predator or prey.

In cities like San Jose, Calif., local governments are using streetlight poles to facilitate equitable access to high-speed internet to dramatically improve educational outcomes for low-income students and expand economic opportunity for their families. Unfortunately, a recent mandate by the Federal Communications Commission might halt the progress made by these cities.\n\nAccess to reliable, high-speed internet service \u2014 commonly referred to broadband \u2014 has become a necessity, not a luxury. An overwhelming majority of public-school teachers assign homework that requires online access, leaving far too many students unable to perform the basic tasks critical for academic success. The sight of public-school students finishing their algebra homework in fast-food restaurants and coffee shops, where they have access to free public Wi-Fi, has compelled hundreds of cities and school districts to find ways to bridge what one official has called \u201cthe cruelest part of the digital divide\u201d: the homework gap.\n\nCities throughout the United States increasingly look to their own streetlight poles to meet this challenge. Because of their optimal height and access to power, the poles can enable emerging telecommunications technologies to deliver high-quality cellular and data service (and eventually 5G service) using small cell devices, and public broadband using Wi-Fi-transmitting hardware. In addition, the ubiquitous presence of streetlight poles can make it easier to deliver high-quality wireless and internet service more equitably throughout a city and connect those low-income neighborhoods that remain vastly underserved.\n\nSensing this enormous opportunity, many mayors in the United States have welcomed the opportunity to partner with the private sector to equip their city-owned streetlight poles with these new technologies and achieve more equitable access in their communities. However, the telecommunications industry has quietly worked to usurp control over these coveted public assets and utilize publicly owned streetlight poles for their own profit, not the public benefit.", "T\u2019s Nov. 11 Travel issue is dedicated to a series of five fairy tales written exclusively for us \u2014 the kinds of stories that will inspire your own adventures, if not of the body, then at least of the mind.

Originally from New York, she speaks with a hint of a Brooklyn accent and once described herself as \u201cthis little tiny little woman.\u201d\n\nThe justice, who is known for her lifetime of work fighting for women\u2019s rights, was the subject of a documentary over the summer, and Hollywood is making a movie from her life story. She gained social media popularity in recent years with her own meme and nickname, \u201cNotorious R.B.G.\u201d As the news about Justice Ginsburg spread on social media on Thursday, some Twitter users volunteered to donate their ribs to her, and others called for protective bubble wrap to be sent her way.\n\nDuring the Obama administration, Professor Chemerinsky and other liberals called for Justice Ginsburg to step down sometime during the summer before the 2014 midterm elections so that Mr. Obama could name her successor. The Democrats went on to cede control of the Senate \u2014 and thus the ability to confirm Supreme Court justices \u2014 in those elections.\n\nWhen Justice Antonin Scalia died in 2016, Mr. Obama nominated a centrist appellate judge, Merrick B. Garland, who had been praised by both parties, to replace him. But the Republican-led Senate refused to consider his nomination so that a new president could make the decision. Mr. Trump chose Neil M. Gorsuch to replace Justice Scalia, preserving the court\u2019s 5-to-4 split between conservatives and liberals.\n\nIn an interview in 2013, Justice Ginsburg said that she would not base her retirement plans on who was currently in the Oval Office. She said she would stay put \u201cas long as I can do the job full steam, and that, at my age, is not predictable.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement. He had been a critical swing vote, generally voting with the court\u2019s conservatives but at times embracing liberal views in major cases.\n\nMr. Trump and Republican allies had hoped Justice Kennedy would step down so that a more conservative justice could be put in place while Senate Republicans were in the majority. Justice Kennedy was replaced by Justice Kavanaugh, one of his former clerks. The Kavanaugh nomination proceedings were the most contentious in decades, and the justice was confirmed in the closest Senate vote since the 19th century.\n\nA hospital spokeswoman on Thursday directed questions about Justice Ginsburg\u2019s condition to the Supreme Court\u2019s press office.", "Four-Bedroom in Westport \u2022 $1,825,000 \u2022 FAIRFIELD \u2022 10 Island Way\n\nA renovated, four-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath, 3,062-square foot home with radiant heat floors, a kitchen with a center island, quartz counters and a water filtration system, a family room with doors to a deck, an office, a front-to-back master suite, a heated salt water pool, patio, outdoor fireplace and two-car garage, on 0.26 acres on Saugatuck Island.

The 2018 midterms sure did not seem to deliver a clear repudiation of President Trump\u2019s racist campaign strategy. His closing ad was so offensive that Fox News wouldn\u2019t even run it. Yet candidates who embraced him and his message won statewide races in Florida, Georgia, Texas, Indiana, Missouri and elsewhere.\n\nIn the new episode of The Argument podcast, I mentioned this pattern as the most disappointing part of the midterms to me. And I was surprised to hear both Ross Douthat and Michelle Goldberg talk me out of my despair. In other places, Michelle pointed out, racism failed as a campaign strategy, and diverse candidates won. Ross argued that the evidence for straight-out racism as an effective strategy actually got weaker this week: If it worked so well, why did Republicans lose across the Midwest \u2014 from Pennsylvania to Iowa \u2014 in the very states that Trump flipped in 2016?", "Good morning.\n\n(Want to get California Today by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\n\nMore money for subsidized housing and a resounding defeat for rent control and activists: That was the message Californians seemed to send to state and local governments on Election Day. Housing issues were scattered across Tuesday\u2019s ballot, including a pair of bond measures that would raise billions for subsidized affordable housing and a much-debated rent control measure that landlords spent heavily to defeat.\n\nThe bond measures both passed, as did Proposition C, a San Francisco initiative that will vastly increase the city\u2019s homeless spending (if it survives a legal challenge). Voters also defeated Proposition 5, a proposal that would have allowed homeowners to take lower property taxes with them when they move.\n\nAt the same time, Californians voted overwhelmingly against expanding rent control by rejecting two local measures and a statewide initiative that would have allowed cities to broaden tenant protections.\n\nActivists were also out. In San Francisco, Matt Haney, a member of the local school board, crushed the insurgent campaign of Sonja Trauss, a housing activist, in a race for a seat on the board of supervisors. But across the Bay in Oakland, Buffy Wicks, a former staffer for President Barack Obama who pushed a pro-housing platform in a run for a State Assembly seat, defeated Jovanka Beckles, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.

Blake\u2019s negotiations with wealth and power are communicated through simple choices in design. Stone finds a perfectly fitted summer dress that allows Blake to pass among the rich, but by contrasting her bare-bones dorm with the self-consciously minimalist style of Ian\u2019s bachelor pad, Stone also elegantly shows the imbalance of power in their relationship.\n\nWhen the dialogue addresses Blake\u2019s choices, the effect is like a needle scratch on one of Ian\u2019s vintage records. Blake obsesses over her dynamic with Ian, imploring friends to reassure her that she is not a hooker. Stone never introduces a perspective that might push back at Blake\u2019s disparaging attitude toward prostitution. So, unlike the sensibly romantic heroines Blake admires, she is never confronted by her own hypocrisies. Over time, even the soft lighting appears to wallow with her in sanctimony.

Per Barron\u2019s: \u201cIt\u2019s finally over.\u201d\n\nCorporate leaders still have much to fear, including President Trump\u2019s trade fight with China. But they view Washington gridlock as largely positive, as it will ward off sweeping policy changes that could upset the strong environment for business. (These are the economic indicators that will show if that theory holds.)\n\nHere are some other key corporate takeaways from the midterms:\n\n\u2022 Energy: Renewables companies benefited from Democratic victories on the state level, where a lot of energy policy is set. Oil producers suffered setbacks in some states, but blocked a carbon tax initiative in Washington State.\n\n\u2022 Tech: Both parties are expected to come together on potential new privacy regulations, but they are likely to clash on net neutrality rules.", "HANOI \u2014 Vietnam wants 50 percent of its social media customers to use domestic social networks by 2020 and plans to prevent \"toxic information\" on Facebook and Google, the information ministry said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThe ministry has been drafting a code of conduct for the internet to \"build a healthy and safe network environment\".\n\n\"We are also conducting research into measures which would prevent negative and toxic information on two foreign platforms, Facebook and Google,\" the ministry said in its statement.\n\nDespite sweeping economic reforms and growing openness to social change, Vietnam's ruling Communist Party tolerates little dissent and exercises strict controls over media.", "Legalizing recreational marijuana. Earlier this year, Mr. Cuomo studied legalizing marijuana in the state. A report issued by the Health Department concluded that the state should have a regulated and taxed market for marijuana. In the past, Senate Republicans have refused to take up the issue, saying that legalizing marijuana was not a priority for them.\n\nStrengthen rent regulation. Facing an affordable housing crisis in the city, a Democrat-run Legislature could roll back some of the changes made to the rent regulation system in the last few decades. They could end rules that take apartments out of regulation when the rent hits $2,733.75 and end the 20 percent bonus that landlords are allowed to tack on to rent when a tenant vacates.\n\nWriting Roe v. Wade protections into state law. In the past, Mr. Cuomo has pushed legislation that would codify the protections guaranteed under Roe v Wade into state law and update the state\u2019s law to allow late-term abortions when the health of the mother is in danger or the fetus is not viable. Senate Republicans have stymied the bill\u2019s passage in the past, but Mr. Cuomo said he wants it passed during the first month of the new legislative season.\n\nSingle payer health care. While it might be a pipe dream for Democrats, the State Assembly has passed a measure to create a single payer health care system for the last four years in a row. The proposal would allow New Yorkers to sign on to health coverage without deductibles or copays. Republicans were unwilling to take up the measure when it was last passed by the Assembly in June.", "What do these four have in common? They voted against Brett Kavanaugh. This fact will become a major problem for Chuck Schumer, the Senate Minority leader, when he tries to round up votes in opposition to Trump court and administration nominees next year or perhaps even more crucially, during the presidential campaign season the following year.\n\nCompounding Schumer\u2019s difficulty: Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, was the one red-state Democrat who voted for Kavanaugh, and he won re-election easily.\n\nLooking forward toward 2020, Democratic prospects of wresting control of the upper chamber are bleak. At the moment, only one Republican incumbent up for re-election in 2020, Cory Gardner of Colorado, looks vulnerable. And Gardner\u2019s chances look better than those of Doug Jones, Democrat of Alabama, who may find himself running against former Senator Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General Trump forced to resign on Wednesday.\n\nJim Newell, writing in Slate in October, described the situation well:\n\nThe 2020 Senate election is shaping up to be the moment when the organic Republican majority within the Senate falls into place. Trump won 46 percent of the popular vote in 2016 but 60 percent of states, and states like Idaho and Wyoming get just as many senators as California. Unless a whole bunch of red states suddenly turn blue, Democrats will be stuck where they are: in the minority.\n\nThe Republican structural advantage in Senate races is reflected in the votes received by each party in Senate contests on Nov. 6. As the political website 538 reported yesterday,\n\nVoters cast 44.7 million votes for Democratic Senate candidates and 32.9 million votes for Republican Senate candidates \u2014 in other words 57 percent of Senate votes went for Democrats.\u201d Despite this huge gap \u2014 Democrats won 11.8 million more votes than Republicans \u2014 \u201cthere will be at least a two-seat gain for Republicans.\u201d\n\nThis pattern outraged Marc Hetherington, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina, who emailed me:\n\nIf there is one thing the election underscores it is how malapportioned America\u2019s representative institutions are. President Trump, of course, won the presidency while losing the popular vote by millions in 2016. Democrats in 2018 managed to eke out a 35-seat pickup while winning a national popular vote margin that is apparently going to be over 7 percentage points. A 7-point victory almost always produces a wave election type margin when translated into seats. But not this year.\n\nHetherington cited the House election in North Carolina:\n\nIn 2018, the GOP maintained their 9-3 majority despite the fact that the Democrats won roughly 100,000 more votes than Republicans did in these 12 contests combined.\n\n\u201cDemocrats in red states felt good about increased turnout. They fielded good candidates in a lot of places,\u201d Hetherington said:\n\nAnd they came up exactly 0 Senate seat wins from the Great Plains to the Atlantic Ocean. Democrats need to figure out a way to win in places they haven\u2019t been winning, and it is not clear that they got a template for that on Tuesday.\n\nMatt Grossmann, a political scientist at Michigan State, also wrote to me along similar lines:\n\nThe Senate looks harder than ever as a long-term prospect for Democrats: without Red State senators, winning and holding the chamber will be near impossible.\n\nGrossmann argues that the ideological positioning of candidates this year had consequences, particularly in contested districts:\n\nLiberal insurgent House nominees who beat establishment alternatives in swing district primaries went 0 for 3 (NE-2, PA-1, CA-45) whereas establishment picks who defeated liberal alternatives went 3 for 3 (PA-7, KS-3, TX-7).\n\nThe same factors were at play for the Republicans, who \u201calso paid for extremism,\u201d Grossmann wrote: \u201cKris Kobach for governor in Kansas and Scott Walker for Wisconsin governor,\u201d but Republicans\n\nwon both of the direct gubernatorial conflicts between candidates from the far left and right: Brian Kemp vs. Stacey Abrams in Georgia and Ron DeSantis vs. Andrew Gillum in Florida.\n\n(Abrams is not conceding defeat and still hopes to force Kemp into a runoff; she campaigned as a progressive, as did Gillum, not as someone on the \u201cfar left.\u201d)\n\nBrian Schaffner, a political scientist at Tufts who helps run polling for the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, told me that suburban voters leaned Democratic by more than ten percentage points but that this \u201cpattern did not extend to the suburbs in the South\u201d where Republican candidates \u201cheld a narrow advantage over Democrats.\u201d", "For months we\u2019ve heard from sundry media apocalypticians that this year\u2019s midterms were the last exit off the road to autocracy. On Tuesday, the American people delivered a less dramatic verdict about the significance of the occasion.\n\nIn a word: meh.\n\nAre you interested in seeing Donald Trump voted out of office in two years? I hope so \u2014 which is why you should think hard about that \u201cmeh.\u201d This week\u2019s elections were, at most, a very modest rebuke of a president reviled by many of his opponents, this columnist included, as an unprecedented danger to the health of liberal democracy at home and abroad. The American people don\u2019t entirely agree.\n\nWe might consider listening to them a bit more \u2014 and to ourselves somewhat less.\n\nA 37-seat swing gave Democrats control of the House\u2014a definite gain, but still less than the 63 seats Republicans won in 2011. Yet even that shellacking (to use Barack Obama\u2019s word) did nothing to help Mitt Romney\u2019s chances two years later. The Republican gain in the Senate (the result in Arizona isn\u2019t clear at this writing) was more predictable in a year when so many red-state Democrats were up for re-election. But it underscores what a non-wave election this was.\n\nIt also underscores that while \u201cthe Resistance\u201d is good at generating lots of votes, it hasn\u2019t figured out how to turn the votes into seats. Liberals are free to bellyache all they want that they have repeatedly won the overall popular vote for the presidency and Congress while still losing elections, and that the system is therefore \u201crigged.\u201d", "Democrats pulled off a significant victory on Tuesday night. No, it wasn\u2019t taking back the House in Congress. It\u2019s what they did in state legislatures around the country.\n\nDemocrats made strides in a number of statehouses. They seized control of seven legislative chambers, flipping the State Senates in Colorado, Maine, and New York; the House in Minnesota; and both chambers in New Hampshire. Connecticut\u2019s Senate, previously evenly split, is now held by Democrats. They broke Republican supermajorities in Michigan and Pennsylvania\u2019s Senates and both chambers in North Carolina.\n\nDemocrats also flipped seven governorships on Tuesday. They now completely control all three statehouse branches in 13 states and Washington, D.C., compared to the seven statehouses where they held trifecta control before Election Day.\n\nThese victories arguably hold the same, if not more, heft than the inroads Democrats made in Congress. At the federal level, legislative achievements have ground to nearly a complete halt in recent years.", "Ross: Speak not of that awful show, which with or without Kevin Spacey shames the memory of the British original. As for soothsaying, were Trump a normal president, or person, you would expect him to seize this opportunity to return to his 2016 populism and triangulate against his own party by, say, finally doing that infrastructure bill. But again, you watched the news conference. Did that seem like a man ready to triangulate? I think not.\n\nFrank: I\u2019m not sure Trump could define or spell \u201ctriangulate,\u201d let alone try it. He would probably blush if you said it to him, mistaking it as counsel from the Kama Sutra. We will not have a big infrastructure bill, because we never get a big infrastructure bill, even though it\u2019s the no-brainer piece of needed legislation and its absence is a complete betrayal of the American children who will inherit our crumbling bridges, cramped airports and constipated trains. But go back to Democrats and a possible subpoena-palooza.\n\n[Go beyond the headlines and behind the curtain with Frank Bruni\u2019s candid reflections on politics, culture, higher education and more every week. Sign up for his newsletter.]\n\nRoss: I think the key for Democrats is to stay focused. That means going after corruption, both Trump\u2019s own and the shady doings of some of his functionaries, without going down every rabbit hole that the party\u2019s conspiracy theorists want investigated. It means getting the Trump tax returns, or trying to, while leaving the Russia stuff to Mueller as long as he\u2019s still allowed to do his work. It means resisting the temptation, which apparently is strong enough that The Federalist\u2019s Mollie Hemingway overheard Jerrold Nadler going on and on about it in a phone call on the Acela today, to try to impeach Justice Kavanaugh for perjury \u2014 and resisting a rush to impeachment for Trump as well. It means treating their newfound investigative power mostly as means to check Trump\u2019s behavior now and weaken him before 2020 \u2014 and recognizing that it would take more extraordinary developments for a path to open to actually removing him. That\u2019s my sense, at least. What do you think?\n\nFrank: I think that Nadler must just ride the Acela between New York and D.C. multiple times daily, because I rarely ride it without spotting him. More seriously: I think that what the most impassioned warriors of the Democratic base want is Trump\u2019s impeachment, because they recognize him \u2014 rightly \u2014 as a danger and a disgrace. But what most Americans want more is a government that seems to be doing its mature, earnest best to govern.\n\nThe next two years will likely be stalemate, but if Democrats are wise, they will show voters that they are doing their damnedest to draft and move along sensible, helpful legislation. Bob Kerrey shared some thoughts about this with me for my Wednesday newsletter this week, and I think he made excellent points.\n\nRoss: Yes, I think that\u2019s right: If you assume that no big, beautiful deals are possible, it makes sense for Democrats to pick a few (but only a few) discrete pieces of potentially popular legislation and march them through the House so that they can attack the Republicans for obstructing them two years hence. (My zeal for family policy makes me wish for a House version of the Sherrod Brown-Michael Bennet child tax credit bill, but that\u2019s relatively unlikely.) My main caution for the Democrats is that despite all their wins this week, their most ambitious progressive candidates \u2014 the Medicare for All endorsees, especially \u2014 often fell short. Which might suggest that the public will respond better to liberal incrementalism (a minimum wage hike, a modest Obamacare fix) than some of the more sweeping ideas that the 2020 candidates are likely to endorse.", "Last month, with a trial date approaching for the New York lawsuit, the administration went to the Supreme Court with a request to block the plaintiffs from taking pretrial testimony from Secretary Ross and John Gore, the acting assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division. Federal District Judge Jesse Furman, presiding over the case, had refused to block the depositions on the ground that the plaintiffs had already made a sufficiently \u201cstrong showing of bad faith\u201d on the part of the two officials to justify further investigation of the decision-making process. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld Judge Furman\u2019s order.\n\nIn the administration\u2019s request to the Supreme Court, Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco argued that because \u201can agency decision maker\u2019s mental processes are generally irrelevant to evaluating the legality of agency action,\u201d there was no reason to \u201cprobe the secretary\u2019s mental processes.\u201d In an unsigned order, the justices agreed, apparently unanimously, to block the deposition of Secretary Ross, while voting 7 to 2 to allow the deposition of Mr. Gore to go forward. The dissenters were Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas, who said the court should have stopped the questioning of both men. Their separate opinion contained a strong hint to Judge Furman: \u201cOne would expect that the court\u2019s order today would prompt the district court to postpone the schedule d trial and await further guidance.\u201d\n\nThat was a hint that Judge Furman chose not to take a few days later, when the administration asked him to stay the entire trial. Rejecting that request, the judge elaborated on his earlier reference to \u201cbad faith.\u201d In a pointed 15-page opinion, he wrote that he had \u201cfound reason to believe that Secretary Ross had provided false explanations of his reasons for, and the genesis of, the citizenship question.\u201d Three days later, the administration was back at the Supreme Court, quoting from the two justices\u2019 earlier dissenting opinion and seeking an immediate stay of the trial. In an unsigned one-sentence order, issued last Friday, the justices refused. The vote this time was 6 to 3. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. joined Justices Gorsuch and Thomas. The trial began in Judge Furman\u2019s courtroom in Manhattan on Monday.\n\nIt takes the votes of five justices to grant any kind of stay. Conspicuously missing from the votes on the administration\u2019s side were Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. and his newest colleague, Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The majority\u2019s silence gives no hint of their reasoning. Maybe the chief justice and Justice Kavanaugh simply found Solicitor General Francisco\u2019s hyperbolic rhetoric unpersuasive. Or maybe it was something deeper, a sense that a 5-to-4 vote to shield the Trump administration from ordinary legal process would have been a needless step on the road to disaster for a court already seen as polarized by political allegiances. By just such incremental developments will the line between comedy and tragedy be etched by the newly constituted Roberts court.\n\nBut for those of us hanging on the court\u2019s every move, there was hardly time to catch our breath before the Trump administration was back at it again, trying to bend the court to its will. On Monday night, it filed three highly unusual petitions at the court, this time seeking immediate review of decisions by three Federal District Courts that have prevented the administration from shutting down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. All three decisions, from courts in New York, San Francisco and Washington, are already in federal appeals courts, with one appeal having been argued and another scheduled to be heard in January. So what\u2019s the rush?", "Another letter, dated Tuesday and sent by the American College of National Security Leaders, a group of former high-level military officers, said: \u201cThe INF Treaty is a bedrock to our current arms control regime and serves rather than hampers American interests.\u201d\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Trump administration on the letters.\n\nThe treaty\u2019s fate may come up this weekend if Mr. Trump sees President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia during a memorial event in France celebrating the centennial of the end of World War I. But there have been conflicting accounts from the White House and the Kremlin on whether the two will even meet.\n\nMr. Putin and his subordinates have warned of a new arms race should Mr. Trump make good on his pledge to renounce the accord. It would be the first time Mr. Trump has scrapped an arms-control treaty, American officials have said.\n\nMany European leaders also have objected to Mr. Trump\u2019s plan.\n\nMr. Trump and his hard-line aides, particularly John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, have long disparaged the treaty, asserting that Russia has cheated on its terms and that it should include China, which is not a signatory.\n\nThe treaty ended a crisis of the 1980s that had come to be seen as a hair-trigger for a nuclear war. The Soviet Union had deployed a missile in Europe called the SS-20, capable of carrying three nuclear warheads. The United States had deployed cruise and Pershing II missiles. All had the capability of reaching targets in as little as 10 minutes.", "You started at Google 14 years ago. Does it still feel like the same company you joined?\n\nWhen I first joined Google I was struck by the fact that it was a very idealistic, optimistic place. I still see that idealism and optimism a lot in many things we do today. But the world is different. Maybe there\u2019s more realism of how hard some things are. We\u2019ve had more failures, too. But there\u2019s always been a strong streak of idealism in the company, and you still see it today.\n\nWhat\u2019s your approach to technology and screen time with your family?\n\nWhen I come home on a Friday evening, I really do want to let go of my devices for a couple days. I haven\u2019t quite succeeded in doing that. At home, our television is not easily accessible, so that there is \u201cactivation energy\u201d before you can easily go watch TV. I\u2019m genuinely conflicted, because I see what my kids learn from all this. My son is 11 years old, and he is mining Ethereum and earning money. He\u2019s getting some insight into how the world works, how commerce works.\n\nEvery generation is worried about the new technology, and feels like this time it\u2019s different. Our parents worried about Elvis Presley\u2019s influence on kids. So, I\u2019m always asking the question, \u201cWhy would it be any different this time?\u201d Having said that, I do realize the change that\u2019s happening now is much faster than ever before. My son still doesn\u2019t have a phone.\n\nWhy does it seem so easy for tech companies like Google to ban pornography and graphic violence from social media platforms, but so much harder for them to root out propaganda, misinformation and disturbing content aimed at kids?\n\nThere are areas where society clearly agrees what is O.K. and not O.K., and then there are areas where it is hard as a society to draw the line. What is the difference between freedom of speech on something where you feel you\u2019re being discriminated against by another group, versus hate speech? The U.S. and Europe draw the line differently on this question in a very fundamental way. We\u2019ve had to defend videos which we allow in the U.S. but in Europe people view as disseminating hate speech.\n\nShould people be able to say that they don\u2019t believe climate change is real? Or that vaccines don\u2019t work? It\u2019s just a genuinely hard problem. We\u2019re all using human reviewers, but human reviewers make mistakes, too.\n\nHow do you approach this in China, where Google is considering returning to the market with a search engine?", "WASHINGTON \u2014 The night before he was fired, Attorney General Jeff Sessions was in high spirits.\n\nHe was watching the midterm election results at the Justice Department with his wife and staff members, according to two people present, and enjoying a final, welcome evening of normalcy before President Trump abruptly ended his bumpy tenure on Wednesday as the United States\u2019 highest law enforcement officer.\n\nWhile Mr. Sessions, 71, did more to carry out Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda than almost any other cabinet official, delivering on immigration and combating violent crime and opioids, he also soured their relationship after only weeks in the position by recusing himself from the Russia investigation. The president, who has made clear that he expected protection from his law enforcement officials, viewed the step as a betrayal.\n\n\u201cThe one laudable thing he did was to recuse himself from the Russia investigation, and for that, he is being fired,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, a frequent critic of Mr. Sessions and the chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.\n\nMr. Trump installed Mr. Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, Matthew G. Whitaker, who had served as a liaison to the White House and gained the president\u2019s trust, as acting attorney general.", "LAWRENCE, Kan. \u2014 A decade ago, a Democrat was governor of Kansas. And Illinois. And Michigan. And Wisconsin. Since then, Republicans dominated, winning governor\u2019s races across much of the Midwest and enacting conservative policies that reshaped the region in their image.\n\nOn Tuesday, there were signs of a shift back toward the politics that had long defined the region. Though Republicans remain the more powerful party in the center of the country, voters flipped governor\u2019s offices back to Democrats in those four states and sent Democrats to Congress in several suburban districts that had long been firmly Republican. Moderation plays well in the Midwest.\n\nThe results suggested that the much-discussed demise of the Midwestern Democrat may have been exaggerated after President Trump\u2019s victory in 2016.\n\nWhat happened in the Midwest this week, bringing an end to total Republican control in three state capitals, was in some cases less a sharp shift on matters of national ideology and more a return to the once-familiar political middle.", "What\u2019s the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently?\n\nCarol Anderson\u2019s \u201cWhite Rage\u201d takes what many of us have known, perhaps existentially or intuitively, and puts it in a new framework, adding a synthesis of thoroughly researched archival evidence that documents the deeply entrenched and ubiquitous nature of white rage \u2014 white backlash, across time and space \u2014 as response to black advancement. She rigorously outlines the opposition to the exercise, by black Americans, of the rights granted to all American citizens in our Constitution. It\u2019s a sobering lesson for understanding where we are in this country right now.\n\nWhat moves you most in a work of literature?\n\nSomething I find in both Banville and Morrison: the ability of the best works to challenge me with difficult knowledge, to show me something about myself through the intimate interaction with a voice and characters different from myself; the ability to show us, across time and space, not that we are different but how we are alike; the ability to historicize the complexities of human nature, as Robert Penn Warren put it, and to evoke the noblest of our human capabilities: the power to empathize \u2014 even with characters we might find reprehensible, whose actions I cannot condone. What moves me most is how great literature enables me to comprehend something of the people I encounter there, how they might have come to be who they are, to do the things they do. In spite of everything, the best literature reaffirms my love for and abiding faith in humanity, in the human potential for goodness and justice.\n\nDid you read poetry as a child? What books made you fall in love with poetry?\n\nMy father, Eric Trethewey, was a poet, and very early in my life he began reciting all kinds of poetry to me, especially the poems of Wordsworth, W. B. Yeats and Robert Hayden. But my father\u2019s poems were some of the earliest I read, even before I could understand them, because I wanted to share that language \u2014 the language of poetry \u2014 with him.\n\nOver the years I came to see that poetry was the best way we had of communicating, of really hearing each other. Beyond that, I think that what made me fall in love with poetic language (if not exactly poetry at first) \u2014 the lyricism and rhythm of syntax, the power of the figurative to make the mind leap to a new apprehension of things \u2014 was Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address. Before I ever committed any poems to memory I had memorized his speech and would recite it to myself over and over.\n\nWas there a book of poems or a poet in particular that inspired you to write?\n\nI loved stories when I was growing up, and for a while I thought I wanted to tell stories in prose, to be a fiction writer. Then my father gave me a copy of Rita Dove\u2019s \u201cThomas and Beulah.\u201d The narrative lyric mode of those poems, as well as their subject matter, opened a new pathway for me \u2014 a new way of thinking of how I might, as Phil Levine put it, \u201cwrite what\u2019s given me to write.\u201d And it was also Levine\u2019s \u201cWhat Work Is,\u201d Yusef Komunyakaa\u2019s \u201cMagic City\u201d and Seamus Heaney\u2019s \u201cNorth\u201d that first inspired me to write poems that could tell the stories I needed to tell. Though she is a prose writer, I would include Toni Morrison in this list.", "BEIJING \u2014 Beijing\u2019s latest urban preservation campaign swung like a wrecking ball this summer through the colorful shops along Yonghegong Street, a tree-lined road between two of the city\u2019s landmarks: the Confucius and Lama Temples.\n\nWorkers wielding crowbars, jackhammers and written orders from the city knocked out tiled eaves and wooden columns decorated with red lanterns and Tibetan prayer flags. Then they bricked up and painted over spaces that had once been doors or windows.\n\nYuan Hong, who a decade ago opened a hair salon on one of the distinctive alleyways known as hutongs not far from Yonghegong, showed up there early one morning recently to find workers knocking out her glass storefront.\n\n\u201cCan you wait for me to get my face washed first?\u201d she said she implored the workers. \u201cCan you slow down a little bit?\u201d", "David Leonhardt\n\nImage\n\nI\u2019ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago \u2014 first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I\u2019ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at BusinessWeek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.\n\nMy politics are left of center. But I\u2019m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today\u2019s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme.

Levenson Institute of Gaming, Hospitality and Tourism at Stockton University in New Jersey. \u201cMany people have time off during the holidays and want to get away, and, in turn, hotels charge premium prices.

Here is Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa\u2019s: He was 8 years old. He was in the supermarket. Next to the register he saw an Archie Comics double digest. He begged his mom to buy it for him. \u201cI kind of never let the Archies go,\u201d he said.\n\nAguirre-Sacasa, 46, \u201cthe good middle age,\u201d he calls it, was speaking in a suite at the Fairmont hotel here. He lives in Los Angeles with his husband and a dog named Ms. Molly, but every week he flies to Vancouver where the CW\u2019s \u201cRiverdale,\u201d now in its third season, and Netflix\u2019s \u201cChilling Adventures of Sabrina,\u201d which began streaming its first season Oct. 26, both shoot. He\u2019s the showrunner for both, corollaries to his role as the chief creative officer of Archie Comics.\n\nThat he\u2019s a (very) senior executive for a company that once sent him a strongly worded cease-and-desist letter (in his 20s, he wrote \u201cArchie\u2019s Weird Fantasy,\u201d a play in which Archie meets up with the murderers Leopold and Loeb and is later revealed as gay, and it\u2019s unclear which was the bigger problem) is just whipped cream on the malted.\n\nWith \u201cRiverdale\u201d and \u201cSabrina,\u201d Aguirre-Sacasa has become an auteur of moody, sexy teen angst. He is a John Hughes for a darker, more cynical, way more libidinous age. When I asked him if \u201cRiverdale\u201d was a thirsty show, he laughed and said: \u201cBig time. Biiiig time. Big time.\u201d", "\u201cThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs\u201d is one of the darkest movies by Joel and Ethan Coen, and also among the silliest.

Ever since \u201cBlood Simple,\u201d the brothers have tended to treat whimsy and fatalism as sides of the same coin. The jokes that the universe plays on hapless human creatures may be cruel, but they\u2019re also funny, and the Coens are skilled and wily metaphysical pranksters. The hangings, shootings, scalpings and other grim ends awaiting the hapless cowboys, prospectors and wagon-train pioneers in this anthology of western tales are incidents of mortal slapstick.

Mr. Musk stepped down as chairman last month but remains Tesla\u2019s chief executive.\n\nMs. Denholm, 55, is the chief financial officer of Telstra, which dominates telecommunications in Australia. She is a longtime technology executive with experience in Silicon Valley, where Tesla is based, and once worked for Toyota in Australia.\n\nThe move to replace Mr. Musk as chairman, announced late Wednesday night, was part of a settlement reached with the Securities and Exchange Commission in September to deal with the fallout from his assertion that he had secured funding for a private buyout of the company. That claim, in a Twitter post in August, quickly fell into doubt. (Mr. Musk later explained in a blog post that discussions with Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund led him to believe that it had both money and enthusiasm for such a deal.)", "The news sent convulsions through the community of Las Vegas shooting survivors who have come to call themselves the Route 91 Family, posting constantly on private Facebook groups and getting together for what they call \u201cmeet-greets.\u201d\n\nBorderline is one of several places that the survivors use for these gatherings, which are meant to heal the trauma of the October 2017 shooting.\n\nJanie Scott, 42, a Las Vegas survivor who runs a Facebook page for others, said that 47 people who made it out of that shooting had posted on her page that they were at Borderline last night.\n\nShe\u2019d spoken with 10 of them today.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just broken,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m hearing a lot of: Why is this our new norm?

Last night he was on his way to the Borderline from a country music concert in Los Angeles to meet friends, when they got a call about the shooting. They rushed to the scene, standing outside the police perimeter awaiting word on the fate of their friends. And last year he planned to attend the Vegas festival, but backed out at the last minute.\n\n\u201cSomeone is looking over me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for the people who got out last night, someone was looking over them too.\u201d\n\nMany of the people he knew from the Borderline were casual acquaintances, familiar faces they saw each week, drinking beer and dancing and listening to music, even if he didn\u2019t know their names.\n\n\u201cNow as I look back I wish I could say I was better friends with them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he knew many people who were present at both shootings. \u201cNo one should have to go through a shooting, let alone twice,\u201d he said.\n\nMichael Millar, 25, an accountant from Thousand Oaks, grew up hanging out at the Borderline, but was not there Wednesday night, unlike many of his friends. He said that for those from Thousand Oaks it is a point of pride to not be from Los Angeles, 40 miles to the east \u2014 he said residents love their 805 area code and country music is a big thing.\n\nThe community is conservative and popular with law enforcement and military veterans. It prides itself on its safety, and has been on a list of America\u2019s safest communities. In 2017, the Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Office handled just five murders in its jurisdiction, which covers thousands of square miles.\n\nOn Thursday Mr. Millar was speaking to a friend who survived both mass shootings. He said that just like in Vegas, when he heard the first shots he thought they were firecrackers. But this time, at the Borderline, a learned response kicked in.\n\nHe told Mr. Millar, \u201cI learned from Vegas not to think twice, but to just get out.\u201d", "It turns out that New York City subway conductors are like actors: They have scripts they are supposed to follow.\n\nThe scripts are in a blue booklet issued by New York City Transit, which wants conductors to keep it close to the vest \u2014 almost literally.

It was the best performance since the start of the global financial crisis in 2008 and current volatility trends are expected to keep the upswing going, according to research firm IHS Markit.\n\nNew regulatory disclosure rules that took effect last year and fresh academic research show, however, there can be a bigger downside to securities lending than previously thought.\n\nFor one, mutual funds may overweight high-demand stocks and bonds because they generate higher fees from short-selling hedge funds. Securities lending, especially for money managers keeping a bigger portion of the fees from fund investors, could distort stock-picking behavior and hurt performance, said Travis Johnson, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin.", "This degree of isolation leaves Mrs. May cut off from the insights that she needs for Britain to avoid calamity. Furious and frustrated politicians, experts, diplomats and business leaders have been blocked, sidelined or ignored when they have tried to brief the prime minister on the catastrophic complexities of Brexit. Even those she listens to rarely hear what she thinks. They often deduce it from how she acts afterward.\n\nBy being so silent, Mrs. May has not made the case for the Brexit deal she wants. Even if she gets Brussels to agree to it, it will fail unless she can get the cabinet and members of Parliament to back it \u2014 not by secrecy and shrewd bluffs, but by full-throated advocacy and persuasion.\n\nAnd that is the fatal flaw in Mrs. May\u2019s punching-bag strategy. She needs support she has not bothered to build. Ever since taking power in 2016, she should have been telling Britain the truth: The Brexit you hoped for is undeliverable because it promised a fantasy. The Brexiteers lied to you. We cannot have all the benefits of the European Union and none of the costs. We must compromise or face disaster.\n\nEven some of Mrs. May\u2019s close supporters say privately that her deal cannot survive. If it reaches the House of Commons, which must approve any Brexit agreement, many Conservative Euroskeptics will rebel, and not enough of the opposition will step in to save her. There will be uproar, chaos, talk of a second referendum and fears of \u201cno deal.\u201d\n\nThis situation was never inevitable. It is the product of an overcautious leader\u2019s fundamental misjudgment of her party\u2019s politics. Mrs. May has always been stronger than she thought; she had defeated the Brexiteers to become prime minister, and none, despite all their sniping and plotting, has had the backing to replace her since. A more courageous leader would have argued publicly for the least disruptive Brexit from the start, persuading a divided country to follow her, avoiding the immense damage we have already inflicted on our businesses, our international reputation and our relationship with our alienated, exhausted European Union partners.\n\nMrs. May has been inadequate, but she was the best her party could agree on. \u201cWould anyone else step up?\u201d an insider asked. \u201cEveryone wants her job after March,\u201d when Britain is set to leave the European Union. \u201cNo one else wants it now.\u201d\n\nJenni Russell (@jennirsl) is a columnist for The Times of London and a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times.", "\u2022 More concerns over Boeing instruments.\n\nAircraft problems may have played a role in the fatal crash of a brand-new Boeing 737 Max 8 in Indonesia last week, investigators said.\n\nAn Indonesian official suggested that inaccurate readings could have prompted the Lion Air plane to enter a sudden, automatic descent.

Their exchange grew heated when Mr. Acosta repeatedly challenged the president\u2019s characterization of a Central American migrant caravan as an invasion. Mr. Trump responded by lashing out at Mr. Acosta, saying, \u201cHonestly, I think you should let me run the country \u2014 you run CNN.\u201d\n\nMr. Acosta, who was in the front row just feet from the president, refused several times to sit down or to return a microphone to a White House intern who sought to retrieve it.

I felt like it was just time to stand up with a positive campaign.\u201d\n\nAnother congressional race in New Mexico involving a Native American candidate was decided on Wednesday night, with the Republican, Yvette Herrell, a member of the Cherokee Nation, losing to Xochitl Torres Small, a Democrat and water rights lawyer, after absentee ballots were counted. Unlike many Native American politicians in other races, Ms. Herrell did not promote her indigenous heritage while campaigning.\n\nIn Kansas, Ms. Davids can add another first to the record books: She is the first openly lesbian candidate to be elected to Congress from the state. She attended Cornell Law School and was a White House fellow in the Obama administration before mounting a campaign highlighting her heritage, sexual orientation and martial-arts mettle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 2018 and women, Native Americans, gay people, the unemployed and underemployed have to fight like hell to survive,\u201d Ms. Davids, 38, said in one of her campaign ads. \u201cIt\u2019s clear Trump and the Republicans in Washington don\u2019t give a damn about anyone like me or anyone who doesn\u2019t think like them.\u201d\n\nJean Schroedel, a professor of political science at Claremont Graduate University in California, who studies Native American voting rights, said Ms. Davids\u2019s campaign offered a blueprint for other candidates seeking to frame issues from a Native American perspective.\n\n\u201cSharice not only won but just took out a rising star of the Republican Party,\u201d Professor Schroedel said, referring to Ms. Davids\u2019s opponent, Representative Kevin Yoder, a four-term incumbent who championed conservative causes. \u201cDemocrats have been targeting that seat for several cycles and she showed them how to get it done.\u201d", "I have had problems with cleaning vomit stains made by my cat. Kitty has excellent litter box habits, mercifully, but she tends to throw up at least once a week. Sometimes, it\u2019s a hairball; other times for seemingly no apparent reason (there\u2019s nothing medically wrong with her). I\u2019ve tried Nature\u2019s Miracle, which did a pretty good job but didn\u2019t get the stain out completely \u2014 I have white wall-to-wall carpeting, so this is really an issue!\n\nYou\u2019ve done the most important thing, which is to check with your vet to make sure that Kitty doesn\u2019t have any medical issues that are causing her to upchuck so regularly. But, based on anecdata from cat owners I have known, a cat\u2019s food can cause frequent upset in our feline friends. So the next time you see the vet, you might ask if a change to her diet might help to minimize the vomiting.\n\nThat said, I can certainly point you to some stain removal products that may help. You mentioned that Nature\u2019s Miracle removed some, but not all, of the staining; it might be that a second pass with that product is all that\u2019s required. An enzyme-based stain remover like Zout or Biz might be more effective than Nature\u2019s Miracle.\n\nIt also might be, as can be the case with doggy diarrhea messes, that the problem is less with the product you\u2019re using to treat the stain and more with the tool. A portable carpet cleaner like the Bissell SpotClean Pro, which performed best in Wirecutter\u2019s test of those machines, might be needed to fully eliminate those stains. But before investing in one, try the toothbrush trick that worked for our friend with the mess-making canine.\n\nMy couch seems to hold on to cat hair like it\u2019s glued there. No vacuum or lint roller gets it all off. What\u2019s the best way to get the hair off materials that seems to attract it? I\u2019m also concerned about allergies \u2014 will vacuuming get rid of dander, even if it leaves behind hair?\n\nRubber, I\u2019m fond of telling people dramatically, is the natural enemy of hair. It\u2019s one of the reasons that rubber brooms, rather than the more common rush-style brooms, are the best choice for sweeping up human or animal hair. And when it comes to furniture, a rubber dishwashing glove is all you\u2019ll need to relieve that couch of its furry slipcover. Simply don the glove on your dominant hand and go over the hair-covered areas. The rubber will cause the hair to ball up into little clumps you can just toss in the trash.", "WASHINGTON \u2014 Matthew G. Whitaker, the attorney general\u2019s chief of staff, jockeyed over the last two months to replace his boss by forging a close relationship with the White House, where he was seen as a reliable political ally. On Wednesday, President Trump fired Jeff Sessions and named Mr. Whitaker acting attorney general, rewarding his loyalty.\n\nInside the Justice Department, senior officials, including Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, have viewed Mr. Whitaker with intense suspicion. Before his current job at the Justice Department, Mr. Whitaker, a former college football tight end, was openly hostile on television and social media toward the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and was seen by department officials as a partisan and a White House spy.\n\nThe special counsel is leading the investigation into whether any of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates conspired with Russia during 2016 election and whether the president tried to obstruct the inquiry. Now Mr. Whitaker will oversee Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation, prompting concerns that he could move swiftly to shut it down or hobble it, despite serious questions about his own potential conflicts in supervising it.\n\n[Read more about how Mr. Sessions\u2019s firing could affect the Russia investigation.]\n\nIn August 2017, Mr. Whitaker highlighted on Twitter a Philly.com opinion article with the headline \u201cNote to Trump\u2019s Lawyer: Do Not Cooperate With Mueller Lynch Mob.\u201d In his tweet, Mr. Whitaker wrote that it was \u201cworth a read.\u201d", "\u7f8e\u671d\u95dc\u4fc2\u300c\u871c\u6708\u671f\u300d\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5df2\u904e\uff0c\u4eca\u5929\u4f86\u770b\uff0c\u96d9\u65b9\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u671f\u671b\u90fd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002\u5e73\u58e4\u8a8d\u70ba\u7f8e\u570b\u5fc5\u9808\u9996\u5148\u6b63\u5f0f\u5ba3\u5e03\u671d\u9bae\u6230\u722d\u7684\u7d50\u675f\uff0c\u4e26\u653e\u9b06\u5236\u88c1\uff1b\u83ef\u76db\u9813\u5247\u5e0c\u671b\u671d\u9bae\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u95dc\u5176\u6838\u9805\u76ee\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8aaa\u660e\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u5236\u88c1\u65b9\u9762\u4e0d\u80af\u9b06\u53e3\u3002\n\n\u7f8e\u671d\u4e92\u52d5\u7684\u53d6\u6d88\u5df2\u662f\u5e38\u4e8b\uff0c\u8209\u4e16\u77da\u76ee\u7684\u300c\u5ddd\u91d1\u6703\u300d\u62c9\u626f\u4e86\u597d\u5e7e\u500b\u56de\u5408\uff0c\u624d\u6700\u7d42\u6572\u5b9a\u3002\u5206\u6790\u7a31\uff0c\u9f90\u76ae\u6b50\u518d\u6b21\u9677\u5165\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u671d\u9bae\u6e05\u695a\u81ea\u5df1\u4e0d\u9858\u505a\u4ec0\u9ebc\u3002\n\n_____\n\n\n\n\u5289\u96f2\u749e\uff08\u53f3\u4e00\uff09\u9078\u64c7\u5c31\u8b80\u7684\u52a0\u5dde\u5927\u5b78\u6d1b\u6749\u78ef\u5206\u6821\u4e26\u4e0d\u5728\u901a\u7528\u7533\u8acb\u7684\u7bc4\u570d\u4e4b\u5167\u3002\u5979\u8aaa\uff0c\u901a\u7528\u7533\u8acb\u7cfb\u7d71\u88e1\u7684\u5b78\u6821\u7533\u8acb\u7d50\u679c\u4e0d\u5920\u7406\u60f3\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u56e0\u70ba\u6587\u66f8\u6c92\u6709\u5beb\u597d\u3002 Courtesy Of Liu Yunpu\n\n\u7de8\u8f2f\u63a8\u85a6\uff1a\u5982\u4f55\u50cf\u500b\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u4eba\uff1f\u4e2d\u570b\u7533\u8acb\u8005\u53cd\u601d\u54c8\u4f5b\u62db\u751f\u6848\n\n\u901a\u5f80\u7f8e\u570b\u9802\u5c16\u5927\u5b78\u7684\u9053\u8def\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e2d\u570b\u5b78\u751f\u901a\u5e38\u611f\u5230\u66f4\u52a0\u70ba\u96e3\u3002\u9019\u500b\u570b\u5bb6\u7684\u50b3\u7d71\u6559\u80b2\u7406\u5ff5\u57f9\u990a\u4e86\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u8003\u8a66\u9078\u624b\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u81e8\u53e6\u4e00\u5957\u8a55\u50f9\u9ad4\u7cfb\u7684\u7be9\u9078\u6642\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u614c\u4e86\u795e\u3002", "State Representative Jeanette Nu\u00f1ez, Mr. DeSantis\u2019s running mate on the governor\u2019s ticket, said Republicans prevailed because Floridians were not ready to accept a candidate like Mr. Gillum who campaigned on hiking the corporate tax rate.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t just be all charisma and a terrible platform,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone, including Ron, talked about what a formidable opponent Andrew Gillum was in terms of his ability to appeal to certain audiences and his ability to communicate with average Floridians.

Under the plea agreement, a judge ordered him to pay $9,404.46 to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which manages the Walk of Fame. That represents the actual cost of repairs to the star, said Leron Gubler, chief executive of the chamber.\n\nIn a YouTube video published shortly after the vandalism, Mr. Clay said his destruction of the star was a \u201cone-man protest\u201d against the president and the Republican Party. \u201cFor as long as that star remains on Hollywood Boulevard, there\u2019s going to be a really negative presence there,\u201d he said in the video.\n\nMr. Clay, of Glendale, Calif., was also sentenced to three years of formal probation, one day in county jail (which he already served) and 20 days of community labor, according to the news release.

The A.P. sent an advisory to its members on Wednesday saying that the race remained too close to call, in part because \u201celection officials say tabulation continues in several large counties.\u201d\n\nIf a runoff is required, it will only intensify a race that was already among the nation\u2019s most contentious \u2014 not least because of Mr. Kemp\u2019s decision to remain secretary of state.\n\nDemocrats have sharply criticized his record on voting issues in the state. Mr. Kemp, who has called accusations that he encouraged voter suppression a \u201cfarce,\u201d oversaw legal purges of voter rolls and embraced a rigorous \u201cexact match\u201d approach to processing voter registrations, among other steps that have drawn criticism.\n\nThe argument over Mr. Kemp\u2019s role sharpened on Sunday, when his office announced that it had opened an inquiry into the Democratic Party of Georgia for what state officials said was an attempted hacking of the voter registration system. Mr. Kemp\u2019s office provided little information about its allegations, which sparked an inquiry by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Democrats assailed the announcement as a political stunt.\n\nMistrust of Mr. Kemp and the state\u2019s election machinery was palpable on the campus of Morehouse College, the historically black men\u2019s school west of downtown Atlanta. The polling place on the campus had stayed open three extra hours Tuesday evening after reports emerged that numerous students who had registered to vote were not listed in the poll books.\n\nAt lunchtime on Wednesday, William Pounds, 19, of Macon, Ga., stood on the Morehouse campus with a group of fellow students who had all voted absentee. Mr. Pounds said that it was difficult not to consider that Mr. Kemp, who is white and bragged that he would round up \u201ccriminal illegals\u201d in his campaign ads, might be acting to disenfranchise people of color.", "Mr. Trudeau\u2019s apology came less than two weeks after a gunman opened fire in a Pittsburgh synagogue, killing 11 worshipers, and at a time when anti-Semitism is rising across North America. It was not lost on many that it was delivered the day after an American election campaign marked by refugee-bashing.\n\n\u201cThe rhetoric we are hearing across the border is very similar to the rhetoric we heard in the 1930s \u2014 the vilification of the other, the vilification of the press. It\u2019s really scary,\u201d said Danny Gruner, who attended Wednesday\u2019s apology with his mother, Ana Maria Gordon, the sole survivor of the St. Louis living in Canada today.\n\nMs. Gordon, who met with Mr. Trudeau privately, was surrounded by many of her great-grandchildren and grandchildren.\n\nLast week, Mr. Trudeau apologized to a British Columbia First Nation for the government\u2019s treachery in inviting six Tsilhqot\u2019in chiefs to peace talks 150 years ago. Instead of talking, the government arrested them, put them on trial and hanged them.\n\nHe has also apologized to Omar Khadr, the only Canadian who was held at the United States military base at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. He emotionally apologized to gay members of the army, the police and in public service who were persecuted \u2014 some even imprisoned \u2014 because of their sexual orientation.\n\nAnd he tearfully said sorry to indigenous people in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, where for much of the 20th century indigenous children were torn from their families and compelled to attend boarding schools, where many were abused.\n\n\u201cYou will not remove the guilt from the perpetrators of the horror,\u201d Mr. Gruner said. \u201cBut at least you can come to terms with what the country was at the time, and try to understand where we are at this particular time and where we want to be.\u201d", "WASHINGTON \u2014 Republican victories in crucial Senate and governors\u2019 races this week have tightened social conservatives\u2019 grip across American government, strengthening the party\u2019s power as it seeks to limit abortion rights and push harder to the right on a number of divisive cultural issues.\n\nEven as Democrats captured the House and promised to act as a check on President Trump and Republican policy priorities, conservatives were breathing a deep sigh of relief on Wednesday after strengthening their majority in the Senate. Their gains in the upper chamber could have a far-reaching impact on the remainder of the president\u2019s term, particularly on his ability to continue shifting the ideological balance on the federal courts.\n\nThe election of conservatives to Democratic-held Senate seats in Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota \u2014 as well as to an open seat in Tennessee, and possibly in Arizona, Florida and Mississippi, where races have not been decided \u2014 will almost certainly add to the Republicans\u2019 one-seat majority. It will also dilute the votes of moderate Republicans like Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom are abortion rights supporters who have opposed judges on the grounds that they could threaten Roe v. Wade.\n\nPresident Trump, who has already filled vacancies on the federal bench at a faster pace than most previous presidents, and cemented a conservative majority on the Supreme Court with two appointments so far, is now in a stronger position to put forward even more conservative judicial nominees if he chooses to.", "The midterm elections on Tuesday laid bare the growing chasm between urban and rural America, leaving Republicans deeply concerned about their declining fortunes in the metropolitan areas that extinguished their House majority and Democrats just as alarmed about their own struggles to win over voters in states that strengthened the G.O.P.\u2019s grip on the Senate.\n\nFor both parties, the election represented an acceleration of dizzying realignment along cultural lines. Districts that once represented the beating heart of the Republican Party rejected President Trump\u2019s avowed nationalism as a form of bigotry, while Democrats further retrenched from the agricultural and industrial communities where they once dominated.\n\nDemocrats took control of the House not merely by making gains in coastal states that supported Hillary Clinton, but also by penetrating deeply into suburban corners of traditionally conservative states in the South and across the Plains, like Georgia, Texas and Oklahoma. The House results made clear that the Trump-induced difficulties Republicans are suffering with once-reliable voters are hardly limited to blue states and could make it substantially harder for the president to remake his upscale-downscale coalition in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe party should be concerned when you look at what was once one of its bases and see how increasingly vulnerable we are with them,\u201d said Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee, an old-guard Republican who heads the Republican Governors Association, pointing to Democratic incursions into localities like Cobb County, Ga., that were once conservative bulwarks.", "The good news is that no one, including Mr. Whitaker, can stop the multiple prosecutions or litigation already in progress \u2014 including the cooperation of Paul Manafort; the sentencing of Michael Flynn; or the continuing investigation of Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump's former lawyer, and the Trump Organization by federal prosecutors in New York. The courts will have the final say on what happens in each of those cases.\n\nDemocrats will also soon be running the House, returning it to its place as a coequal branch of government and holding Mr. Trump to account for the first time since he took office. \u201cWe are immediately issuing multiple letters to key officials demanding that they preserve all relevant documents related to this action to make sure that the investigation and any evidence remains safe from improper interference or destruction,\u201d Representative Jerrold Nadler, the New York Democrat who is expected to soon head the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe bad news is, well, pretty much everything else. Mr. Whitaker \u2014 who has been called the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of the White House inside the Justice Department by John Kelly, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff \u2014 has expressed a Trumpian degree of hostility to the investigation he is now charged with overseeing. He has called it a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and, in its earliest months, wrote an opinion piece arguing that Mr. Mueller was coming \u201cdangerously close\u201d to crossing a \u201cred line\u201d by investigating the president\u2019s finances. He has suggested there was nothing wrong in Mr. Trump\u2019s 2017 firing of James Comey, the F.B.I. director, and he has supported the prosecution of Hillary Clinton. In an interview last year he described \u201ca scenario where Jeff Sessions is replaced with a recess appointment, and that attorney general doesn\u2019t fire Bob Mueller, but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\u201d In 2014, he headed the political campaign for Iowa state treasurer of Sam Clovis, who later became a Trump campaign aide and, more recently, a witness in the Russia investigation.\n\nConflicts of interest like this are what led Mr. Sessions to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. That was the ethical thing to do, even if it sent Mr. Trump into a spiral of rage.\n\nMr. Sessions, a veteran of the Senate, is an institutionalist at heart. \u201cThe Department of Justice,\u201d he once said, \u201cwill not be improperly influenced by political considerations.\u201d That sentiment was never going to survive long under Mr. Trump, for whom improper influence has been a central plank of governing philosophy. Ethics, not so much.", "He has already moved to potentially change the infrastructure of the Russia investigation being conducted by the special counsel, Robert Mueller.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump requested the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and received it. Matthew Whitaker, Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, will replace him, at least on an acting basis. Before he became chief of staff last year, CNN described Mr. Whitaker this way:\n\n\u201cMatthew Whitaker is a CNN legal commentator and former U.S. attorney who directs the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT), a conservative ethics watchdog group. He ran in the Republican primary for Iowa Senate in 2014.\u201d\n\nIn an article Mr. Whitaker wrote then for CNN under the headline \u201cMueller\u2019s Investigation of Trump Is Going Too Far,\u201d he complained:\n\nIt does not take a lawyer or even a former federal prosecutor like myself to conclude that investigating Donald Trump\u2019s finances or his family\u2019s finances falls completely outside of the realm of his 2016 campaign and allegations that the campaign coordinated with the Russian government or anyone else. That goes beyond the scope of the appointment of the special counsel.\n\nIn another part of the article Whitaker wrote:\n\nAny investigation into President Trump\u2019s finances or the finances of his family would require Mueller to return to Rod Rosenstein for additional authority under Mueller\u2019s appointment as special counsel. If he were to continue to investigate the financial relationships without a broadened scope in his appointment, then this would raise serious concerns that the special counsel\u2019s investigation was a mere witch hunt. If Mueller is indeed going down this path, Rosenstein should act to ensure the investigation is within its jurisdiction and within the authority of the original directive.\n\nIt is unclear at this point how this staff change will affect Mueller and his investigation, now that oversight for his work is being taken away from Rosenstein. But there is no way to view this move and not worry about the future of the investigation.\n\nTrump now has at least two avenues to appoint a permanent successor to Jeff Sessions: Send a new nominee before a more favorable Senate with even more Republican votes, or make a recess appointment over the holidays.\n\nAs Steve Vladeck pointed out last year in Slate:\n\nArticle II, Section 2, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution empowers the president \u201cto fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.\u201d And as the Supreme Court concluded three years ago in the Noel Canning case, \u201cthe Recess of the Senate\u201d can include just about any formal recess that lasts 10 or more days \u2014 no matter whether it\u2019s an intersession or intrasession recess \u2014 and the vacancy at issue need not arise during the recess. (Both these holdings were over the nominal dissents of four of the more conservative justices.)\n\nAs Vladeck explained, the Senate need only recess for 10 or more days with no formal business on the Senate floor \u2014 for the Christmas holidays, for instance \u2014 and \u201cTrump could simply recess-appoint whoever he wants to serve as attorney general until the end of the next Senate session.\u201d In this case, that next session would end in January 2020.\n\nThe incoming Democratic majority in the House would have absolutely no say in this.\n\nDemocrats did well in the elections for the House in part because representation there is a reflection of where people are. The Senate, on the other hand, is tied to land. Indeed, the fewer people in these states, many of them solidly Republican, the more weight each person\u2019s vote carries. The Electoral College lives between the two equations.", "A former United States representative from Texas was sentenced Wednesday to 10 years in prison and ordered to pay about $1 million in restitution after being convicted of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars meant for charity and using it to pay for personal expenses and his political campaigns.\n\nIn April, a federal jury found the former congressman, Steve Stockman, 61, guilty on 23 counts \u2014 including money laundering, conspiracy and making false statements \u2014 after prosecutors alleged that he had orchestrated a yearslong scheme to defraud charitable donors.\n\nTwo of Mr. Stockman\u2019s former aides also pleaded guilty last year to multiple counts connected to the case.\n\n\u201cAt trial, the government proved to the jury that former Congressman Stockman ran his campaign and fraudulent charities to simply enrich himself and defrauded well-meaning donors,\u201d Ryan K. Patrick, United States attorney for the Southern District of Texas, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThis type of corruption by public officials gives our entire democratic system a black eye.\u201d", "WASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans\u2019 expansion of their Senate majority means that the conservative legal movement is poised to expand and entrench its influence over the federal courts, leaving Democrats with dwindling hopes of being able to swiftly diminish that imprint even if they win the White House in 2020.\n\nThe net pickup by Republicans of about three seats leaves President Trump and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, positioned to accelerate their already record-breaking pace of appointing federal judges through at least 2020. The White House and Mr. McConnell will now have more running room to get young and outspoken conservatives through even if a few Republicans break ranks, and they can consolidate the new conservative majority on the Supreme Court if a justice leaves during the next two years.\n\nBut the midterm results have longer-term implications as well. By broadening their Senate majority from 51 seats to about 54 (some races have yet to be decided), Republicans have expanded their chances of retaining control of the chamber after 2020. Only a handful of Republican Senate incumbents will be up in states where Democrats are competitive, and they have their own vulnerable incumbents, too.\n\nAs a result, even if a Democrat defeats Mr. Trump and takes over the White House in 2021, Mr. McConnell is likely to retain sufficient power in the Senate to prevent that president from appointing judges to start swinging the pendulum back. That situation would be similar to what happened in President Barack Obama\u2019s final two years in office, when Republicans, after taking control of the Senate, systematically blocked his nominees to fill vacancies on both federal appeals courts and the Supreme Court.", "\u201cTed is a champion for conservative causes,\u201d said Jeff Roe, Mr. Cruz\u2019s chief strategist. \u201cHe\u2019s a champion in Texas and he\u2019s a champion nationally. So I don\u2019t think you should look for him to start straying from his principles.\u201d\n\nA political culture transformed\n\nRepublicans have long claimed the pop culture of Texas as their own \u2014 the barbecue joints and country music stars and pickup trucks. Mr. O\u2019Rourke embraced those Texas symbols and reclaimed them for Democrats, jamming with Willie Nelson, steering his San Antonio-built Toyota pickup truck through rural Texas and air-drumming post-debate in the drive-through lane at Whataburger. It used to be an awkward counterculture stretch to be a Texas Democrat. He made it cool.\n\nEven before Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s narrow defeat, his yard signs had become one of the biggest visible displays of blue Texas in a generation. His signs easily outnumbered Cruz signs and helped convince the public, the news media and Republicans, long before the polls showed a tight race, that change was coming. It was a mass front-lawn revolt. If you were a Democrat in Texas, the question this fall became: \u201cWhere\u2019s your sign?\u201d Up until now, Republicans rarely had yard signs \u2014 why bother with a sign when you ruled the state? The strategy on political merchandise is likely to change in the future.\n\nTurning to 2020\n\nThere might be a sequel to all this in two years.\n\nJohn Cornyn, the state\u2019s Republican senior senator, is up for re-election in 2020. Democrats are likely to fire up once again. Will it be Mr. O\u2019Rourke? No one knows for sure.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke failed to turn a well-funded, well-publicized and well-run campaign for Senate into a win. Now, strategists are asking a question: If he couldn\u2019t do it, then who can? And if not now, then when? One of the other Texas Democratic stars \u2014 Julian Castro, the Obama-era secretary of housing and urban development \u2014 may be booked up in 2020, as he is seriously considering a run for president.\n\nCould even bigger things also be in store for Mr. O\u2019Rourke? He is that rare Texas Democrat whom even Republicans generally have nice things to say about. In the wake of Tuesday\u2019s election, an unlikely voice seemed to be urging Mr. O\u2019Rourke to consider running for president in 2020, even though he has said he\u2019s not interested. That voice belonged to Mr. Roe, Mr. Cruz\u2019s chief strategist.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t predict Democratic politics, but the fervent following that he has nationally, no one else compares to him on their side,\u201d Mr. Roe told reporters at the Houston hotel ballroom where Mr. Cruz held his victory party. \u201cNo one does. He is in a league of his own in the Democratic Party, and if he doesn\u2019t use that to run for president, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019d do with it.\u201d", "The unexpected victory of Max Rose in the 11th Congressional district, which encompasses Staten Island and a sliver of southern Brooklyn, now means that the current president cannot count a single Republican in the House of Representatives from New York, the city that invented him.\n\nStaten Island, a Republican stronghold, skewed heavily for Donald Trump in 2016, but now even voters who remained loyal to the president were willing to give Mr. Rose, a 31-year-old former combat veteran and health care executive, a chance to prove he could reshape the fortunes of working people.\n\nThe last time this district sent a Democrat to Congress was in 2008.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the election, I saw 15 Beto O\u2019Rourke T-shirts for every one Max Rose T-shirt in brownstone Brooklyn, which is to say that the race failed to enrapture many New Yorkers despite the fact that it was happening in New York. In light of that, Mr. Rose\u2019s accomplishment seems singularly impressive \u2014 as well as instructive \u2014 more so even than what Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez managed to do in her primary fight against a longtime Democratic Party loyalist, a feat that left her anointed as the future of liberal politics.\n\nBut Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s gifts of charisma are not easily scalable.\n\nWe might begin with what Mr. Rose had to overcome \u2014 the lack of any telegenic appeal or especially inspired and passionate speaking style or a claim to Staten Island imparted by birth. If you were a Vogue editor, your first instinct upon seeing or hearing him would not be to commission a 3,000-word profile and dress him in Tom Ford for the portrait.", "What Trump Said\n\nPeople within the Democrat Party at a high level have suggested getting rid of ICE, getting rid of law enforcement. That\u2019s not going to happen.\n\nThis is exaggerated.\n\nIt is true that some left-wing Democratic lawmakers \u2014 including several potential presidential candidates \u2014 have called for abolishing or replacing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. But most Democratic leaders have stopped short of demanding the elimination of the agency that is part of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leaders, support overhauling ICE but not abolishing it. That position also is backed by Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the second-ranking Democrats in their chambers.\n\n\u201cICE does some functions that are very much needed,\u201d Mr. Schumer said in June. \u201cReform ICE, yes. That\u2019s what I think we should do.\u201d\n\nAsked in August where she stands on abolishing ICE, Ms. Pelosi said: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with that at all. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. I don\u2019t like some of the policies of ICE, and we have to have oversight over ICE and we have to reform ICE as to some of how they do work.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that any Democrat has broadly suggested \u201cgetting rid of law enforcement.\u201d\n\nWhat Trump Said\n\nReporter: My question is on health care. How is it possible to keep premiums down and cover pre-existing conditions without the individual mandate to fund it?\n\nMr. Trump: Well, first of all, what we're doing \u2014 and we\u2019re, if you look at the Department of Labor also, secretary \u2014 separately, Secretary Azar, what they\u2019ve done, they\u2019ve come up with some incredible health care plans, which is causing great competition and driving the prices right down.\n\nThis is misleading.\n\nUnder Secretary Alex M. Azar II, the Health and Human Services Department issued a rule in August that allowed consumers to purchase short-term health insurance plans. Those plans are not required to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nSeparately, the Labor Department issued a rule in June allowing small businesses to band together to buy health insurance plans, known as association plans. While the plans are not allowed to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, or charge them more, the insurance does not have to cover benefits like maternity care or mental health services.\n\nWhat Trump Said\n\nWe have close to a $100 billion trade deficit with Japan.\n\nThis is exaggerated.\n\nThe United States had an overall trade deficit of $56.6 billion with Japan in 2017 \u2014 about half of Mr. Trump\u2019s estimate.", "Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we\u2019re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times.\n\nBy Talya Minsberg\n\nWomen have cleared many barriers in sports, but few exploits have been as stunning, and steeped in mystery, as the day Jackie Mitchell struck out two of baseball\u2019s giants, Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.\n\nIt was April 2, 1931, and Mitchell, all of 17, was on the roster of the otherwise all-male Tennessee minor league team the Chattanooga Lookouts, which had signed her to a contract just a week before. The Yankees were in town for an exhibition game as they made their way from spring training in Florida back to New York, and 4,000 people had filled the Lookouts\u2019 stands.\n\nMitchell took the mound in the first inning, in relief. \u201cThe Babe performed his role very ably,\u201d William E. Brandt, a reporter for The New York Times, wrote. \u201cHe swung hard at two pitches then demanded that Umpire Owens inspect the ball, just as batters do when utterly baffled by a pitcher\u2019s delivery.\u201d\n\nThe third pitch was a strike that left Ruth looking. When the umpire called him out, the Bambino flung his bat away, \u201cregistering disgust with his shoulder and chin,\u201d The Times reported. Gehrig took \u201cthree hefty swings\u201d and struck out, too.", "\u201cThere was nothing reported that morning,\u201d he said.\n\nRegardless, the appearance of Darnold in a walking boot on Wednesday is an alarming blow to the Jets, who took Darnold with the No. 3 pick in this year\u2019s draft. They have lost three in a row and were set for a favorable matchup at home against the Buffalo Bills on Sunday, a game which would have presented their 21-year-old franchise quarterback a chance to bounce back after two difficult games on the road.\n\nBowles would not rule Darnold out for Sunday and said surgery was not on the table at the moment. But if Darnold does not practice again on Thursday and Friday, Bowles said it was a \u201cforegone conclusion\u201d that the 39-year-old backup, Josh McCown, would start.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re torn because your friend and teammate can\u2019t go,\u201d McCown said. \u201cI don\u2019t wish that on anybody.

That\u2019s why you play this game.\u201d\n\nDarnold was named the starter for Week 1 after beating out McCown in training camp. But his rookie season has been full of ups and downs. His four interceptions in a loss to the Dolphins on Sunday gave him an N.F.L.-high 14 over all.\n\nHe could not pinpoint the cause of the injury or when it happened, saying only that he felt a little \u201cnicked up\u201d after the game. Darnold was sacked four times and hit seven.", "HBO has long been the crown jewel of American television.

Last week, HBO went dark for both DISH and DISH-Sling, the main competitors to DirecTV and DirecTV Now, AT&T\u2019s television services. This brazenly anticompetitive strategy does not portend a happy future for the viewing public, or for HBO itself.\n\nAt the risk of saying \u201cwe told you so,\u201d it was widely predicted before the merger that AT&T would use HBO and other Time Warner media properties in just this way. When the Justice Department sued (unsuccessfully) to block the merger last year, its case was premised on the idea that AT&T would use its ownership of such properties to hurt its rivals in telecommunications. And now it is doing so.\n\nPost-merger, AT&T has the means and the incentive to raise prices on valuable content (like HBO or the coverage of the N.C.A.A. \u201cMarch Madness\u201d basketball tournament) for cheaper, \u201cunintegrated\u201d telecom competitors that have been saving consumers money.

The fact that the Democrats now control one house of Congress means that President Trump\u2019s pillage of environmental regulations will at least proceed under the spotlight of investigation. Half a dozen new states now have governors and legislatures willing to consider cutting greenhouse gas emissions significantly.\n\nAnd yet I confess I came away from Tuesday night feeling unsure that there really is the political space to get done what needs doing in the time that we have left.

As acting attorney general in that capacity, Mr. Rosenstein has overseen and vigorously defended the investigation, led by Mr. Mueller.\n\nAfter requesting and receiving Mr. Sessions\u2019s resignation on Wednesday, President Trump wasted no time in naming Matthew Whitaker, Mr. Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, as acting attorney general, and shifted the oversight role from Mr. Rosenstein back to the attorney general\u2019s office and its new acting head.\n\nAs ethics experts, we believe Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself from the investigation.

In Michigan and North Dakota, initiatives gave voters the opportunity to legalize marijuana for recreational use. In Missouri and Utah, voters chose whether to allow people who are sick to use the drug for medical reasons.\n\nHere are the results of those initiatives.\n\nMichigan voters legalized the sale and use of marijuana\n\nMichigan became the first Midwestern state to legalize recreational marijuana, and the 10th state, in addition to the District of Columbia, to allow adults to possess the drug in small amounts for recreational use. Fifty-six percent of the state\u2019s voters cast ballots in favor of the measure.\n\nIn doing so, voters endorsed Proposal 1, the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act, which permits people who are 21 or older to possess and grow cannabis and related concentrates for personal use. It also licenses commercial production and retail sales of marijuana.\n\n[Voters weighed in on key issues through more than 150 ballot initiatives nationwide.]\n\nAdvocates of legalization said the measure would curb arrests and redirect tax money. The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, which tracked the progress of the Michigan vote and the marijuana ballot initiatives in other states, said voters\u2019 approval of Proposal 1 was a \u201cresounding rebuke\u201d of the state\u2019s policy of prohibition and of its \u201cracist application\u201d of arrests.", "Vic Zoschak, president of the Antiquarian Booksellers\u2019 Association of America, was optimistic on the sudden resolution. \u201cI choose to believe yesterday\u2019s dialogue between the two camps will be but a start to improved communications and relations, each dedicated to a continued win-win association,\u201d he said.\n\nExperts in selling on Amazon said that such parity was difficult to achieve.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anything like this has ever happened before with any part of Amazon,\u201d said Juozas Kaziukenas, chief executive of Marketplace Pulse, an e-commerce analytics firm. \u201cIt would be much harder to have a strike on Amazon itself, just because there are so many sellers there and they are not part of an organized community.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhoever owns the platform owns the power. As a seller you are a small module in a massively complicated system. If a thousand of you say you will not do something anymore, 2,000 others will replace you. This is the harsh reality of being a seller.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Brown of Eureka Books, the lesson of Banned Booksellers Week was clear.\n\n\u201cWe are entirely subject to their whims,\u201d he said of Amazon. \u201cWe need to spend more time focusing our energies on our own business outside of the Amazon ecosphere.\u201d\n\nThere was recently an effort to organize Amazon sellers as a trade association called the Online Merchants Guild. It was largely focused on sales tax issues, but the group said on its website that \u201cthe sky\u2019s the limit in terms of how we can leverage our collective strength to improve the quality of life for all members.\u201d\n\nIf nothing else, Banned Booksellers Week was the sort of public relations stumble for Amazon that seems a bit more common than it once was.\n\nThe company thrives on secrecy, preferring to release minimal information. It began as a bookseller and is now the largest in the world, controlling more of the market than any bookseller has ever done, and yet the number of serious books about Amazon itself could be counted on the fingers of one hand.", "As of Wednesday afternoon, he had received more than 63 percent of the vote.\n\nMr. Hof had previously run for State Assembly as a libertarian in 2016. It was his first run at public office, Mr. Muth said, and he lost to the incumbent, James Oscarson. In June, Mr. Hof defeated Mr. Oscarson in the Republican primary.\n\nMr. Hof was born in Phoenix on Oct. 14, 1946, according to his website. His first job was delivering newspapers, and he later pumped gas. He went on to open several gas stations of his own, first in Arizona and then in Nevada, before entering the brothel business.\n\nWhen he died, Mr. Hof had gained a national reputation as an outspoken supporter of brothels in Nevada, the only state in the country where they are legal in some counties. Nye County said in a report this year that in 2016 and 2017, brothels generated more than $392,000 for the county, offset by costs of just over $31,000.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with Channel 4 News in Britain, Mr. Hof said that if prostitution were illegal, it would be run by criminals instead of being safe and regulated in a legal sphere. Mr. Hof was the star of the HBO television series \u201cCathouse,\u201d which focused on the Moonlite BunnyRanch, his brothel east of Carson City.\n\nIn 2015, the former N.B.A. player Lamar Odom was hospitalized after he was found unconscious at one of Mr. Hof\u2019s brothels.\n\nIn April, two women told The Las Vegas Review-Journal that Mr. Hof had sexually assaulted them. One of them, Jennifer O\u2019Kane, said that he put his hands around her throat one night in 2011, told her she \u201cwas his\u201d and raped her, and that she was \u201craped and battered daily\u201d by Mr. Hof.\n\nMr. Hof denied the claims, telling The Review-Journal that they were \u201cmuckraking in the political cesspool that keeps so many good people from running for office.\u201d", "Under the regulation, if Mr. Whitaker were to block any of Mr. Mueller\u2019s steps, Congress must be notified.\n\nMr. Trump was \u201cclearly\u201d motivated to replace Mr. Sessions to affect the Mueller investigation, said David Kris, a founder of the Culper Partners consulting firm who led the Justice Department\u2019s national security division during the Obama administration.\n\nAn open question, he said, is what Mr. Whitaker will do \u2014 and what reactions that will provoke from Mr. Mueller, other federal prosecutors and House Democrats.\n\n\u201cWhat guerrilla-war tactics will he try to take to limit Mueller\u2019s activities?\u201d Mr. Kris said of Mr. Whitaker. \u201cUnder the regulation, he has a bunch of supervisory actions he can take and if he does undertake those actions, the more extreme they are, the more likely they will provoke reactions from other players in this drama.\u201d\n\nCan Mr. Whitaker fire Mr. Mueller?\n\nThe regulation that Mr. Rosenstein invoked when appointing Mr. Mueller also made it more difficult to fire him. It said that the attorney general may remove the special counsel only for cause, like misconduct of some kind, rather than at will.\n\nMr. Whitaker could decide that Mr. Mueller has committed misconduct and fire him, or he could revoke the protections that the regulation provides to Mr. Mueller and then fire him without cause.\n\nCan Mr. Whitaker quash a Mueller report?\n\nWhen Mr. Mueller completes his work, he is to deliver a report about his findings to the attorney general, according to the regulation.

The group endorsed 225 candidates in this election cycle, nearly all of whom were Democrats.\n\nL.G.B.T. candidates ran for office in record numbers this year. \u201cSuccess breeds success,\u201d said Annise Parker, the president and chief executive of the Victory Fund and former mayor of Houston.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going out and pleading with people to run,\u201d she added. \u201cThese are people who say, \u2018I want to go out and do this and bring my whole self to the campaign.\u2019\u201d", "Image\n\nBabies of older fathers are at greater risk of premature birth, low birth weight and other neonatal problems, a new study reports.\n\nMothers may also be affected: Those with older partners were more likely to have gestational diabetes, probably because older paternity is associated with changes in the placenta.\n\nThe study, published in BMJ, used data gathered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on more than 40 million live births between 2007 and 2016.\n\nCompared with babies of fathers 25 to 34, those whose fathers were 45 to 54 had a 15 percent increased risk for premature birth, and an 18 percent increased risk for seizure. They were 14 percent more likely to be admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit, and 9 percent more likely to need antibiotics. Babies of fathers older than 55, although there were few in the study, were at even greater risk. The study controlled for maternal age and other factors.", "\u201cThis is a very rational decision for Amazon to make in the micro; in the macro, it reinforces a really challenging trend for the U.S. economy,\u201d said John Lettieri, the president of E.I.G. \u201cThe divide between prosperous and distressed regions is growing wider. And it\u2019s because of things like this.\u201d\n\nIn previous economic expansions, E.I.G. has found, the benefits were more broadly felt, and growth was driven by more places, including rural communities. Today, data points about the national economy no longer describe well what\u2019s happening on the ground in many places.\n\nPart of what has changed is that the American economy has become dominated more by companies like Amazon, which produce services instead of manufactured products, and thus employ software engineers instead of assembly line workers.\n\nDrop a big Amazon headquarters into Washington or New York, and economists expect the 50,000 workers there to be more productive than if the same 50,000 jobs were dropped into Indianapolis. Simply putting them in New York, near so many other tech workers, increases the likelihood that Amazon invents more services, connects to more markets, makes more money.\n\nThose added benefits are so strong, economists say, that it\u2019s worth it to companies like Amazon to pay more \u2014 a lot more \u2014 for office space and employee salaries in New York City.\n\n\u201cIf you are in the business of making new things \u2014 whether it\u2019s a new product, or a new way of delivering things, or a new service \u2014 and it\u2019s something that is unique, and it keeps changing and it needs updating, the most important factor of all is human capital,\u201d said Enrico Moretti, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cIt\u2019s not like making soap, or like making textiles.\u201d\n\nMr. Moretti\u2019s latest research suggests that scientists who move from small to larger clusters of experts produce more inventions, a pattern that plays out regularly in Silicon Valley. Looked at another way, a majority of patents come out of the largest metro areas. If we spread their inventors evenly across the country, Mr. Moretti said, we\u2019d probably have significantly less innovation in America.", "Others said that thinking was outdated, and many prominent liberals and conservatives immediately called on MSNBC to reinstate Mr. Olbermann, who is normally outspoken but who had no comment on his suspension on Friday.\n\nAbout 100,000 people signed a petition circulated by a progressive group. \u201cFree Keith Olbermann!\u201d wrote David Weigel, a Slate columnist and a contributor to MSNBC, who called cable news an \u201cever-evolving petri dish of political/journalistic ethics.\u201d\n\nIn suspending Mr. Olbermann, MSNBC, a favorite of liberals, appeared to be trying to differentiate itself from the Fox News Channel, a favorite of conservatives, which does not discourage employees from making personal donations to candidates or political causes. Fox\u2019s parent company, the News Corporation, came under fire from Mr. Olbermann and others in recent months for donating $1.25 million to Republicans. One of the top hosts on Fox, Sean Hannity, contributed thousands of dollars to two Republican Congressional candidates this year.\n\nOn Friday night, the MSNBC host Rachel Maddow made the difference between the two explicit, citing Mr. Hannity\u2019s contributions, saying: \u201cWe are not a political operation. Fox is. We are a news operation. And the rules around here are part of how you know that.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHosts on both MSNBC and Fox News have become political actors in recent years, giving broadcast time to favored candidates and in some cases allowing those candidates to make fund-raising pitches. MSNBC\u2019s shift to the left has caused squeamishness internally, especially among sibling NBC journalists. But the shift has also increased the ratings and the profits of MSNBC.\n\nPhil Griffin, the MSNBC president, made the decision to suspend Mr. Olbermann after consulting with Steve Capus, the president of NBC News, and Jeff Zucker, the chief executive of NBC Universal. Early Friday afternoon, Mr. Griffin said in a statement, \u201cMindful of NBC News policy and standards, I have suspended him indefinitely without pay.\u201d\n\nOne NBC executive agreed with the point, suggested by senior executives at other television news divisions, that Mr. Olbermann\u2019s transgression in making the donations was compounded by the fact that he had anchored the election coverage \u2014 not simply worked as a commentator.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Years ago, Mr. Olbermann gave voice to dissenting views about the Iraq war and about Bush administration policies when few others on television would, and more recently he helped advance the Obama administration\u2019s push for a health care overhaul. Mr. Griffin has called the seven-year-old \u201cCountdown\u201d the tent pole of MSNBC, which has rebuilt itself as a home for liberal-minded Americans.\n\nMr. Olbermann has long been a volatile figure inside the network. He has repeatedly fought with Mr. Griffin and other managers over editorial decisions and has been harshly critical of his former bosses.\n\nStill, some MSNBC employees were stunned by the suspension. Some bloggers seized on the fact that another MSNBC host, Joe Scarborough, had not been reprimanded when he made a contribution to a Republican in 2006 (although an NBC spokesman said he had asked for permission). Others said Mr. Olbermann was being held to a strange standard; a writer for the libertarian magazine Reason, Michael C. Moynihan, wondered why MSNBC had a \u201cone-size-fits-all policy\u201d on contributions.\n\n\u201c \u2018Countdown\u2019 exists to promote Democratic candidates and liberal policies, which is just fine by me,\u201d Mr. Moynihan wrote. \u201cSo why shouldn\u2019t Olbermann, as a private citizen, be allowed to donate money to those candidates he plumps for on television?\u201d\n\nSome networks differentiate between anchors and reporters and those offering opinions.\n\nThe suspension comes at a particularly tricky time for MSNBC. NBC Universal is in the midst of a change of ownership, with its potential new owner, Comcast, seeking final federal approval for the sale. It hopes to conclude the deal by the end of the year.\n\nSenator Bernard Sanders, the independent from Vermont, in a statement called Mr. Olbermann\u2019s suspension \u201coutrageous,\u201d adding, \u201cThis is a real threat to political discourse in America and will have a chilling impact on every commentator for MSNBC.\u201d\n\nMSNBC initially said that Chris Hayes, the Washington editor of The Nation magazine and an MSNBC contributor, would fill in for Mr. Olbermann. But Mr. Hayes said he did not feel comfortable doing so under the circumstances, and the channel ended up having a straightforward news anchor, Thomas Roberts, fill in Friday night.", "Mike Duhaime, a Republican strategist in New Jersey who has worked on national campaigns, said his fear is that \u201cwe\u2019re shrinking ideologically as a party \u2014 and that\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of the diversity of the party is leaving. If we\u2019re going to be competitive in these suburban areas, if we\u2019re going to take back Congress, it is going to have to be in these suburban areas,\u201d Mr. Duhaime said. \u201cAnd our brand is going to need to be more than just Trump.\u201d\n\nNowhere was the fracture with the Trump-led Republican Party more potent than in a swath of wealthy suburban enclaves in the northeastern part of New Jersey, where Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy helicopter pilot and federal prosecutor, defeated her Republican opponent by more than 12 percentage points. It was a stunning margin in a seat that had been held for 24 years by Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, a genteel, moderate Republican deal maker who rose to become the powerful chairman of the Appropriations Committee. The district had not elected a Democrat since President Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration.\n\nMs. Sherrill\u2019s victory was one of seven for Democrats along the so-called Acela corridor between Washington and New York: one in Northern Virginia, three in the Philadelphia region, three in New Jersey and one in New York City. In New York, Max Rose, a 31-year-old military veteran, ousted Representative Dan Donovan in a district centered on Staten Island, long a Republican stronghold and where Mr. Trump had remained relatively popular.\n\nJohn McLaughlin, who served as a pollster for Mr. Trump in 2016 and who was involved in House races in 2018, blamed Republican congressional leaders more than the president for the losses in the region, citing the tax bill in particular as \u201ca policy mistake that hurt many Republicans in the Northeast and others in high-income suburbs.\u201d\n\nWhile the measure cut taxes across the board, it placed a cap on the popular state and local tax deduction that is heavily used in the wealthier parts of high-tax states like New York and New Jersey. \u201cThe tax cut was good policy to grow the economy and create jobs, but when Republican leadership refused to negotiate a higher cap or phase it out over time, it made many suburban Republicans vulnerable,\u201d Mr. McLaughlin said.", "\u5e15\u7279\u91cc\u514b\u00b7\u6070\u5e15\u7279(Patrick Chappatte)\u662f\u300a\u7ebd\u7ea6\u65f6\u62a5\u300b\u793e\u8bba\u6f2b\u753b\u5e08\u3002\n\n\u6b22\u8fce\u8bbf\u95ee\u5176\u4e2a\u4eba\u7f51\u7ad9\u6216\u5728Twitter\u4e0a\u5173\u6ce8\u4ed6\u3002\n\n\u70b9\u51fb\u67e5\u770b\u672c\u6587\u82f1\u6587\u7248\u3002\n\n\u70b9\u51fb\u67e5\u770b\u66f4\u591a\u6f2b\u753b\u4f5c\u54c1\u3002", "The latest TVs pack better image quality than ever before into impossibly thin bodies, but their designs leave little room for decent built-in speakers.

Installation is as simple as plugging in a single cable (in addition to the power cord). Once it\u2019s connected, any sound that would have come out of the TV\u2019s tinny speakers routes through the soundbar\u2019s superior speaker instead. A single bar of speakers and a subwoofer can\u2019t match the immersive sound of a full surround-sound system with separate speakers wired into every corner of the room, but the ease of installation is worth the trade-off.\n\nAfter testing multiple soundbars, Wirecutter found that the Vizio SB3651-E6 offers the best value. It typically costs less than $250 yet sounds comparable to models that cost much more. Whereas most other soundbars only simulate surround sound, the Vizio actually has rear speakers, which plug into the wireless subwoofer.

And while Mr. Trump made comments suggesting that the tariffs would be lifted once the previous trade deal, the North American Free Trade Agreement, was renegotiated, that has not happened.\n\nCongress does not have direct control over tariffs, so it is unclear whether the Democrats could influence them.\n\nBut the change in congressional power could effect climate change policy and environmental law.\n\nWhen Mr. Trudeau came to office in 2015, he made climate change one of his top priorities and swiftly moved to work with the Obama administration on the subject. Mr. Trump has since unwound many of those measures.\n\nMr. Trudeau is now working to keep Canada\u2019s national carbon pricing program intact after some provinces refused to participate or withdrew from it. Critics argue that taxes on emissions from Canadian industries put them at a competitive disadvantage with their American counterparts, though Mr. Trudeau\u2019s system makes allowances to prevent that.\n\nIt\u2019s likely, Professor Rowlands said, that the House will fight any further environmental rollbacks by the Trump administration. Still, he said, he doubted it would be able to reverse the many significant changes it has made to date.\n\n\u201cThe view here is that the House will be able to contain some of the things the administration has done that, from a Canadian perspective, have been a disaster,\u201d he said.", "A driver charged with manslaughter after she fatally struck two young children and injured a pregnant mother in Brooklyn last March was found dead in her Staten Island home on Tuesday in what appeared to be a suicide, the police said.\n\nThe body of the driver, Dorothy Bruns, 44, was discovered by a friend in her Targee Street apartment around 5 p.m., the police said. A bottle of prescription pills and a suicide note were near her body. The medical examiner has not yet determined a cause of death, but the police are investigating the case as a likely suicide.\n\nMs. Bruns had multiple sclerosis and was prone to seizures. Though her doctors had ordered her not to drive, she was behind the wheel when she ran a red light on March 5 at Ninth Street and Fifth Avenue in the Park Slope neighborhood, hitting Abigail Blumenstein, 4, Joshua Lew, 1, and their mothers.\n\nBoth children were killed.

Harvard was accused of discriminating against Asian-American applicants, but the university firmly denied this throughout the trial, which ended last week.\n\nThrough testimony and internal documents, the case provided an eye-opening look into the often guarded and opaque admissions process at Harvard. With some 40,000 applicants and about 1,600 available seats, Harvard argued, some students would inevitably be left out.\n\n[The Harvard admissions lawsuit, explained.]\n\nHow admissions officers went about that sifting process seemed to some in the gallery like an exercise in cynicism, which perpetuated the established ruling class, and to others like a noble pursuit, which lifted \u201cdiamonds in the rough,\u201d of all backgrounds, into the future elite. Here\u2019s what we learned about who gets an admissions edge:\n\n\u2018A.L.D.C.\u2019s\n\nHarvard gives advantages to recruited athletes (A\u2019s); legacies (L\u2019s), or the children of Harvard graduates; applicants on the dean\u2019s or director\u2019s interest list (D\u2019s), which often include the children of very wealthy donors and prominent people, mostly white; and the children (C\u2019s) of faculty and staff. ALDCs make up only about 5 percent of applicants but 30 percent of admitted students.\n\n[Five Harvard freshmen have a frank talk about how they got in.]\n\nWhile being an A.L.D.C. helps \u2014 their acceptance rate is about 45 percent, compared with 4.5 to 5 percent for the rest of the pool \u2014 it is no guarantee.

She went to Middlebury College instead.)", "RICHMOND, Ky. \u2014 At 5 a.m. on Election Day, Mark Nickolas awoke to write a speech he thought would never be delivered.\n\nMr. Nickolas, the campaign manager for Amy McGrath, one of the Democratic Party\u2019s most high-profile candidates for Congress, quickly drafted a 400-word concession, printed it, sealed it in an envelope, and then deleted it from his computer.\n\nHe had hoped to burn it after Ms. McGrath claimed victory. Instead, at 8:28 p.m., he pulled out the envelope and handed it to her.\n\nMs. McGrath\u2019s loss to Representative Andy Barr in this central Kentucky congressional district made vivid the yawning divide between rural America and the rest of the nation.

She won almost 60 percent.", "That changed after Donald Trump won the 2016 election, in ways that both enlarged and further polarized the electorate. A dozen groups like Be the Change sprung up \u2014 Our Revolution, Indivisible Manteca, Patterson Progressive Alliance. The groups came together as the CA 10 Progressive Alliance, united in their determination to flip the district. They reached out to engage the young and disenfranchised. And they registered voters; the total in the district increased 18 percent since the last midterm, almost double the statewide average.\n\nAs in the rest of California, the biggest increase came in independent voters, whose numbers since the last midterm grew more than 50 percent; they now make up almost a quarter of the district\u2019s voters. That further complicates the political calculus, underscoring the degree to which personal beliefs and connections outweigh party loyalty.\n\nMr. Denham, who won re-election two years ago by less than 4 percent, campaigned on his familiar name and identification as a businessman who shares the district\u2019s values. The words \u201cveteran\u201d and \u201cfarmer\u201d figured prominently on his signs. In an agricultural and industrial area where guns are popular and abortion is not, Mr. Denham was outspoken in support of the Second Amendment and in opposition to abortion. He ran a vicious television advertisement that used an out-of-context clip to suggest Mr. Harder supported taxpayer-financed abortions through the ninth month.\n\nIt will take weeks of analyzing votes that have not even been tallied to determine exactly who voted and how much of the race turned on support or opposition to President Trump versus the contest between Mr. Denham and Mr. Harder. That the Republican may have eked out another win is a testament to the strength of incumbency and the convictions of his conservative base, who vote far more reliably than the new and the disillusioned voters whom the Harder coalition worked to enfranchise.\n\nOn the issues, Mr. Denham\u2019s alliance with the president increased his vulnerability. Growers have been among Mr. Denham\u2019s core supporters, but Trump policies on immigration and trade have hurt the walnut and almond growers and dairies that are bulwarks of the local economy. The congressman highlighted Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment to help get more water for farms, although the promises have yet to translate to action. And on health care, a key concern for many in a district that relies heavily on Obamacare, Mr. Denham reneged on a promise to vote against cuts in the Affordable Care Act, joining Republicans\u2019 unsuccessful effort to repeal and replace.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an elephant in the race for California\u2019s 10th Congressional District, and Jeff Denham is carrying him on his back,\u201d wrote The Modesto Bee, endorsing Mr. Harder after having supported Mr. Denham in all but one of his previous races. \u201cThat orange elephant\u2019s name is Donald.\u201d\n\nMr. Denham\u2019s campaign script sought to distract attention from the issues and sow doubts about the values of the man he only referred to as \u201cBay Area Harder,\u201d often adding \u201cliberal\u201d as the ultimate pejorative. Like many young people, Mr. Harder had left the valley \u2014 in his case to attend Stanford and Harvard and work at a venture capital firm. He was not politically involved and did not even vote until he moved back to Turlock to run for Congress, galvanized by the election of Mr. Trump.", "Want climate news in your inbox?

On that front, the results were mixed: Several key climate policies on the ballot, including a carbon tax in Washington State and an aggressive renewable power target in Arizona, were defeated soundly. But Democrats who favor clean energy also took control of a number of key governorships and state legislatures, opening doors for expanded action.\n\nOn the national level, Democrats recaptured the House and are expected to put climate change back on the agenda, albeit cautiously.

Republicans preserved their hold on the Senate and increased their majority slightly, making it likelier that Mr. Trump would be able to confirm a replacement.\n\nBut House Democrats have made clear that they plan to use the subpoena power that will come with their majority to reopen the lower chamber\u2019s own investigation into the Russia matter.\n\nThe abrupt ouster of Mr. Sessions resembled in some ways the decision by President George W. Bush to oust Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld in 2006 the day after a similar electoral defeat in midterm elections. In that case, Mr. Bush was attempting to mollify his critics. Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to fire Mr. Sessions appeared likely to inflame his adversaries on Capitol Hill.\n\nJohn F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, called Mr. Sessions before the president\u2019s postelection news conference on Wednesday to tell the attorney general that Mr. Trump wanted him to step down, the administration official said. Mr. Trump, who did not speak with Mr. Sessions himself, then ducked questions about Mr. Sessions\u2019s fate at the news conference.\n\nMr. Sessions then had his letter, which was undated, delivered to the White House. \u201cDear Mr. President, at your request I am submitting my resignation,\u201d he wrote. He added, \u201cMost importantly, in my time as attorney general we have restored and upheld the rule of law,\u201d and thanked the president.\n\nMr. Trump announced the resignation and Mr. Whitaker\u2019s assignment on Twitter. \u201cWe thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well!\u201d he wrote. \u201cA permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date.\u201d\n\nThough Mr. Trump has said for months that he wished to replace Mr. Sessions, lawmakers and administration officials believed that firing the attorney general before the midterm elections would have had negative consequences for Republicans in tight races. So it came as little surprise when Mr. Sessions was asked to resign the day after the midterms were over.", "Mr. Lehmann-Haupt was The Times\u2019s chief obituary writer from 2000 to 2006, and then a freelance obituarist until his retirement in 2014. His subjects included Mr. Updike, Elizabeth Hardwick, William Styron and Peter Matthiessen. Several of his obituaries written in advance have yet to be published.\n\nThe Matthiessen obituary, published on April 5, 2014, conveyed insights that spoke of firsthand knowledge of his subject, and it brought Mr. Lehmann-Haupt his first Page 1 byline.\n\n\u201cA rugged, weather-beaten figure who was reared and educated in privilege \u2014 an advantage that left him uneasy,\u201d Mr. Lehmann-Haupt wrote, \u201cMr. Matthiessen was a man of many parts: litt\u00e9rateur, journalist, environmentalist, explorer, Zen Buddhist, professional fisherman and, in the early 1950s, undercover agent for the Central Intelligence Agency in Paris.\u201d\n\nMr. Lehmann-Haupt was himself a favorably reviewed author. His first novel, \u201cA Crooked Man\u201d (1995) focused on a United States senator who pushes legislation to decriminalize recreational drugs. His second, \u201cThe Mad Cook of Pymatuning\u201d (2005), was a sinister take on a 1950s boys\u2019 summer camp gone chillingly awry, with undertones of \u201cLord of the Flies,\u201d William Golding\u2019s 1954 novel about British boys stranded on an island and their disastrous attempts to govern themselves.\n\nHis memoir, \u201cMe and DiMaggio: A Baseball Fan Goes in Search of His Gods\u201d (1986), recalled his childhood love of Yankee baseball games on the radio. \u201cMel Allen\u2019s bronze gong of a voice would ring in the darkness around me with a description of a game being played hundreds of miles away,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd at the border of sleep and dreaming, I would discover again, as if it were a coin in tall grass, the hope that my team might win tomorrow.\u201d\n\nIn a review in The Times, Donald Hall, the poet and critic, wrote: \u201cAt last count, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt had written four million two hundred and twenty four thousand four hundred and seven book reviews for this newspaper. He had not himself committed a book. Maybe he should quit while he is ahead, for \u2018Me and DiMaggio\u2019 is another excellent hymn to the joys of baseball.\u201d\n\nChristopher Charles Herbert Lehmann-Haupt was born in Edinburgh on June 14, 1934, the eldest of three sons of Hellmut and Letitia (Grierson) Lehmann-Haupt, who lived in New York City. Christopher was born on a visit to Scotland by his parents. He and his brothers, Carl and Alexander, were half siblings of John and Roxana Lehmann-Haupt, the children of their father\u2019s marriage to Rosemarie Mueller in 1948.", "This year, Republicans generally succeeded in recruiting high-performing candidates to Senate contests in Florida, North Dakota and Arizona, even in a national political environment that sent House Republicans for the doors.\n\nDemocratic House candidates were helped by the declining value of incumbency, which made it harder for Republicans to outrun disapproval of the president.\n\nThe same forces, however, made it harder for Democratic senators to run as far ahead of the national party as they had in the past, and often their states had shifted far to the right since their last election.\n\nIn general, the split decision between the House and the Senate can be attributed mainly to the combination of the growing relationship between presidential vote and congressional vote and the declining value of incumbency. The apparent loss of Senator Bill Nelson in Florida, in particular, is not consistent with a typical wave election result. But this is the main driver of the difference between the results in the two chambers.\n\nDemocrats benefited from a huge number of Republican retirements, and they have flipped eight of those seats so far. Many retirements were inevitable, but the number \u2014 the highest since 1992, a redistricting year \u2014 was not. Democrats also benefited from a string of court decisions that eroded or outright eliminated Republican gerrymanders in Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and, most recently, Pennsylvania.\n\nIt is hard to measure the accumulated effect of these decisions. But it could have easily represented the Democratic margin of victory in Virginia\u2019s Seventh District and in Pennsylvania\u2019s Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and 17th. That\u2019s atop Democratic gains already realized in 2016 in Florida and Virginia.\n\nThe Democratic disadvantage in the Senate isn\u2019t going anywhere. State lines aren\u2019t about to be redrawn, after all, and Hillary Clinton won just 19 states in 2016 while winning the national popular vote.", "But this election had consumed her lunch hours, nights, weekends and holidays. On Oct. 1, she counted: 1,347 postcards, most of them written at night while her husband was at work and she sat in front of \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show.\u201d They were sent to voters in a neighboring congressional district. She estimated she wrote and sent another thousand in the weeks after that.\n\nLater that month, she took a week\u2019s vacation from her job to go with her husband, Jim, 45, an X-ray technologist, to knock on doors in the district, hundreds of them. They were both brand-new to the game, and they both loved it.\n\nBut it meant a lot more nerves on a night like Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI tend to get overly excited about things, and when they don\u2019t happen, get that much more depressed,\u201d she said beforehand. \u201cSo I\u2019m trying to think not that far ahead.\u201d\n\nThe 2016 election had flipped a switch for her. She felt \u201csick, like the country was sick,\u201d like things had gone badly wrong. It was not mere partisanship \u2014 she had voted occasionally for Republicans before; Mr. Dabruzzo had even voted for Rick Santorum, \u201cbefore he went crazy.\u201d But the Trump victory was different.\n\nThis was the case for nearly all the people at the bar on Tuesday night. Most had done almost no political work before 2016, certainly not knocking on strangers\u2019 doors. Then President Trump came and with it \u201cthis knot in my stomach,\u201d Professor Norman said.\n\nThe morning after that election, Professor Norman and her husband created the Order of the Phoenix at their kitchen table. It was named after the secret society in the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books, which was set up to fight the villain, Lord Voldemort. It would go on to have more than 7,000 members on Facebook, including Ms. Dabruzzo, all of whom would write postcards, campaign and canvass in local elections.", "I woke up Wednesday morning and, as people like me are wont to do, glanced over the Senate seats that will be up for re-election in 2020. On paper, they look better for the Democrats. This year, the Democrats were defending 26 seats, and the Republicans just nine. The Democrats\u2019 26 included 10 incumbents in states that President Trump carried. In 2020, it\u2019s the Republicans who\u2019ll be defending a majority of the seats \u2014 22 out of 33.\n\nThat sounds hopeful, if you\u2019re a Democrat. But if you look at the map, you see that most of the Republican-held seats are in states that would elect a dog before they\u2019d elect a Democrat. Louisiana, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Nebraska, Idaho, Wyoming \u2014 you get the picture. All told, there are about 14 states where the idea of electing a Democrat to the Senate is all but inconceivable, and another three or four where it\u2019s perhaps not inconceivable but where the stars would need to align just so. The numbers for comparably Democratic states are perhaps 12 and I think zero.\n\nSpecifically with respect to 2020, if you had to ponder five possible pickups that would give the Democrats control, here are the states and senators on whom the Democrats need to focus: Susan Collins of Maine; first-termer Joni Ernst of Iowa; Thom Tillis of North Carolina, another first-termer; Cory Gardner of Colorado, a third first-termer; Jon Kyl of Arizona; and I suppose David Perdue of Georgia, or maybe John Cornyn of Texas, should the exciting Beto O\u2019Rourke decide to take him on.\n\nFrom that list, I trust you can see the problem. If Democrats are having to count on North Carolina (where the party last elected a senator in 2008) and Georgia (2000) and Arizona (1988), they\u2019re barking up an awfully tall tree.\n\nWhat can they do? People discuss long-term \u2014 and long-shot \u2014 fixes, like adding the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico as states the first chance they get. At an even greater extreme, maybe someday we should do to the Senate what Britain did to the House of Lords in 1911 and strip it of real lawmaking power. That may sound crazy, but something must be done. On Tuesday, according to The Times, Democratic Senate candidates garnered 45 million votes, and Republicans just 33 million (57 percent to 42 percent). Yet, the Republicans will gain perhaps three seats. That is not democracy.", "Had Teodoro grown weary, one would have forgiven him. But the year we met, his 57th in Venezuelan political life, Teodoro was still driving his vintage Yaris to work every day, still serving as editor of Tal Cual, the newspaper he had founded. He was still writing his incisive, mordant, antigovernment editorials, still fending off attacks from the administration of President Ch\u00e1vez. Perhaps more than anything else in his career, the Tal Cual editorials placed him at the center of Venezuela\u2019s public sphere. Readers waited for them. Politicians took cues from them. The president couldn\u2019t stand them.\n\nFrom his desk, Teodoro could hear the news streaming from a small television in the adjoining office of Azucena Correa, his assistant of three decades, and whatever else he was doing, he digested the headlines at the same time. He would interrupt himself: \u201cOh, my god, the cardinal is denouncing Ch\u00e1vez!\u201d And he jumped up to alert his staff.\n\nOr when former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of Argentina (then a senator) criticized Mr. Ch\u00e1vez: \u201cShe hit it out of the park! What a home run!\u201d He pantomimed swinging a baseball bat, watching the ball disappear over a fence.\n\nThe rhapsodic obituaries published over the past week belie the fact that Teodoro had few allies in Venezuelan politics. Conservative opponents of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez saw Teodoro as a barely reformed Communist. They liked him most for the moments that he considered mistakes, such as when he momentarily accepted a coup that briefly removed Mr. Ch\u00e1vez from power. Many Chavistas saw him as a sellout, a former comrade who had traded in his leftist bona fides for a taste of power in the 1990s, when he held a post in the cabinet of Rafael Caldera, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s predecessor.\n\nIndeed, the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has hit Tal Cual with a volley of lawsuits, one of which barred Teodoro from leaving the country and ordered him to make weekly appearances in court. He was 82 years old.\n\nFor all of these reasons, one would have forgiven Teodoro for turning to pessimism. And when I last saw him, on a rainy afternoon in 2012, I thought for a moment that he had. I asked him who among Venezuela\u2019s young politicians might carry on his work. He looked blank. I mentioned several names, and he shook his head at each one.\n\nTeodoro leaned back in his chair and looked away from me, a rare moment of silence in our interviews. I braced myself for a dark prophecy, for the words of a politician who would die with possibly no successors. Instead, he said, \u201cAparecer\u00e1n,\u201d a word that means \u201cThey will appear.\u201d Then he said it again: \u201cThey will appear.\u201d\n\nDorothy Kronick is an assistant professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.", "It took a remarkable effort to sound so casual. That\u2019s one lesson of the hugely expanded 50th anniversary reissue of \u201cThe Beatles,\u201d the double album that has been known as the White Album since its release in November 1968.\n\nOn the surface, the White Album marked a shift from the orchestral formality and sonic experimentation of \u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band.\u201d Its core approach returned to the four Beatles strumming and picking guitar and bass, pounding a piano and socking the drums. There are giggles and hoots and wisecracks scattered through the album, as if making the music was a lark.\n\nBut as Beatlephiles have long known and the reissue documents, the White Album was by no means back to basics. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr worked painstakingly, using start-to-finish live-studio performances as a foundation but then building around them. In the studio, the Beatles ran through songs again and again, often in all-night sessions that ended up wearing down their producers and engineers. The new White Album package peers deeply into their labors; it includes, for instance, Take 102 of George Harrison\u2019s \u201cNot Guilty,\u201d a song that never reached the finished album.\n\n[Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.]\n\nThe anniversary edition holds six CDs (two with remixes of the original LPs, four with mostly unreleased recordings) and a Blu-ray disc with high-definition mixes, packed in a hard-bound tome of exhaustive annotations and images of handwritten lyrics. One CD collects what are called the Esher demos: four-track recordings, mostly just acoustic guitars and vocals. They\u2019re workmanlike, sometimes jokey sketches, clearly awaiting further development. The other three discs draw from the protracted studio sessions. While Beatles lore has depicted the making of the White Album as the beginning of the group\u2019s breakup, the hours of previously unreleased tapes reveal a band patiently and often jovially working together.", "The firing of Mr. Sessions came a day after midterm elections that handed control of the House to Democrats, dealing a major blow to Mr. Trump for the final two years of his term. Republicans preserved their hold on the Senate and increased their majority slightly, making it likelier that Mr. Trump would be able to confirm a replacement.\n\nBut House Democrats have made clear that they plan to use the subpoena power that will come with their majority to reopen the lower chamber\u2019s own investigation into the Russia matter.\n\nThe abrupt ouster of Mr. Sessions resembled in some ways the decision by President George W. Bush to oust Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld in 2006 the day after a similar electoral defeat in midterm elections. In that case, Mr. Bush was attempting to mollify his critics. Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to fire Mr. Sessions appeared likely to inflame his adversaries on Capitol Hill.\n\nJohn F.

The State Department announced early Wednesday that it had been canceled.\n\n\u201cOngoing conversations continue to take place,\u201d the statement said tersely.\n\nThe cancellation leaves little doubt that the diplomatic process between the United States and North Korea is now mired in quicksand after peaking in Singapore with the initial summit between the two leaders. There are mismatched demands and expectations on both sides, and the pitfalls have only gotten more obvious in recent weeks.\n\nAt the White House later Wednesday, Mr. Trump said the meeting would be rescheduled and insisted that \u201cwe\u2019re very happy with how it\u2019s going with North Korea.\u201d", "Under magnetic resonance imaging, they observed the mechanics of how the artists make the distinctive beats that sound like percussion instruments using only their mouths.

The scientists, with specialties in computer science, engineering and linguistics, are comparing the movements in beatboxing to those used to make speech.

Early on the morning of Sept. 25, his computers and hard disks were seized.\n\nMr. Anderson, who does not currently have a job, was also prohibited from using or disposing of any assets \u2014 excluding for modest living expenses \u2014 and was restrained from further developing or distributing Infamous and any other cheat software.\n\nFailing to do so, the court order noted, could result in his imprisonment. He is acting as his own attorney , he said, and has yet to file a defense.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just beating up on me,\u201d Mr. Anderson said of the game publishers, arguing that the search and seizure order was a disproportionate response. Infamous was designed to help players combat cheaters using more sinister modifications, almost like an antivirus software, he said.\n\nBut Alex Walker, editor of the gaming website Kotaku Australia, said that Infamous was \u201cjust a straight-up cheat.\u201d Cheats, he said, \u201cbreak and exploit parts of the game code to advantage the experience of one player at the disadvantage of other players.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is genuinely harmful to the community,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a statement provided to The Times, Take-Two Interactive said it was \u201ccommitted to protecting our multiplayer community from harassment and other disruptions to their shared entertainment experiences.\u201d", "Between the ages of 5 and 10, I spent many solitary weekends at my grandparents\u2019 house reading middle grade books and playing Pok\u00e9mon on my Game Boy. The fact that I read one and played the other was unimportant; I was captivated by both in the same way \u2014 by how detailed they were, by how even the most trivial bits of information could prove meaningful in the context of their respective narratives. I spent an unjustifiable amount of time not only playing games like Pok\u00e9mon, but also scouring them for secrets that may or may not have existed. The kinds of rumors that surrounded such games are instantly recognized by most millennials: \u201cYou can catch a Mew\u201d \u2014 a particularly coveted and elusive Pok\u00e9mon \u2014 \u201cif you can get to the truck next to the S.S. Anne\u201d; \u201cThere\u2019s a secret stash of Pok\u00e9mon behind Bill\u2019s house.\u201d\n\nMost of these rumors were at their apex when dial-up was the norm and YouTube didn\u2019t yet exist \u2014 there were no 34-year-old man-children making hundreds of thousands of dollars off video game walk-throughs. I was 5 when Pok\u00e9mon Red and Pok\u00e9mon Blue came out, too young to know the difference between bogus and legitimate sources of information, and too young to use the internet. Even when I was old enough to wait 15 minutes for AOL to boot up, I was more likely to stumble on a forum of adolescents swearing by the existence of some hidden magical portal in the game than to find reliable intelligence.\n\nIn later versions of Pok\u00e9mon, developers started indulging the rumors by planting items that corresponded to the rampant speculation online. These hidden items were referred to as Easter eggs. Some Easter eggs helped players advance in the game; some provided insight into the story line or clarified loose plot points; some seemed to have no purpose other than enabling players to boast about having found them.\n\nBecause even the most nondescript Easter egg could end up enhancing the gaming experience in some way, players were obliged to take them seriously. That random vase in the middle of your character\u2019s path, or the old man incoherently babbling about a cave outside town: These are what Italo Calvino called, in a literary context, \u201cmagic\u201d objects. \u201cThe moment an object appears in a narrative, it is charged with a special force and becomes like the pole of a magnetic field, a knot in the network of invisible relationships,\u201d Calvino wrote in \u201cQuickness,\u201d one of a series of lectures on literature he was working on at the time of his death. \u201cThe symbolism of an object may be more or less explicit, but it is always there. We might even say that in a narrative, any object is always magic.\u201d", "Speaking of Emails\n\nI got one from my friend Bob Kerrey, the former senator and former Nebraska governor, who is one of the most thoughtful Democrats I know. It had some terrific points, which he permitted me to share:\n\n\u201cIt could have been worse. My (free) advice to congressional Democrats (they define what the party stands for more than the governors) is to:\n\n\u201cAsk the Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin delegation to set the House agenda . . . What do we need to do to win the electoral college votes of these four states? If Dems get this right, they will celebrate a very satisfying victory over Trump in 2020. They do not need to impeach him; they need to defeat him!\n\n\u201cLook for proposals that are difficult for the G.O.P. For example, propose to take the cap off income that is taxed for Social Security and use the money to cut the payroll tax for everyone else. Health care must be another but let Stabenow, Casey, Brown and Baldwin write the bill. (Note from me: Kerrey is referring to Democratic senators from, respectively, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin \u2014 all crucial battleground states in a presidential election.)\n\n\u201cPush the immigration compromise front and center. Let Americans know that Trump is lying on this. We want a secure border. \u2018Build the wall\u2019 will not work.\n\n\u201cBe much stronger on national security.\n\n\u201cPush our women into the spotlight to highlight the differences between what female G.O.P. members of Congress want and what female Democrats want.\n\n\u201cHelp Americans understand how conservative judges will shift power from individuals to corporations.\n\n\u201cAnd a question: Will Fox News and their President talk about the \u2018caravan crisis\u2019 any more? I seriously doubt it. The leftists in Honduras who set the caravan in motion cost us Senate seats in Missouri, Indiana, Arizona, Nevada and perhaps Texas. Trump-Hannity lied about this to bring out the fear vote BUT it was a very effective lie.\u201d\n\nA Gay Day in America\n\nThe overarching question of whether Democrats would seize control of at least one chamber of Congress eclipsed many other story lines during this election season, including the likelihood that Representative Jared Polis, a Colorado Democrat, would become the first politician to be elected a governor in America as an openly gay person.

It\u2019s also a provocative one. In addition to offering some historical perspective, Churchwell has a point to make. \u201cAmerica first\u201d might never shed the stain of virulent racism and anti-Semitism, but the American dream, she suggests, has a real and discernible meaning located in its origins, one that gives \u201cvoice to principled appeals for a more generous way of life.\u201d\n\nTo that end, she recounts how \u201cthe American dream\u201d emerged in print in the late 19th century, when the Gilded Age gave way to the Progressive Era. A New York Evening Post editorial from 1900 depicted \u201cdiscontented multimillionaires\u201d pleading for special privileges as despoilers of the dream, rather than the realization of it. In Churchwell\u2019s telling, the real American dream, the one she insinuates is worth reclaiming, isn\u2019t just a Jeffersonian ideal of \u201clife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\u201d but the conditions that put the ideal within reach of every citizen: a dream, she says, that is \u201call but synonymous with social democracy.\u201d\n\nImage Sarah Churchwell\n\nWhich isn\u2019t to say that she ignores how the American dream accrued and shed meaning over time, becoming a pliable repository for whatever the country claimed to hold dear. During the Roaring Twenties, \u201cit began to appear far more often in tandem with glorifications of wealth,\u201d she writes \u2014 and therefore took on an ironic, even facetious, dimension among critics of the new dispensation. F. Scott Fitzgerald may not have used the exact term \u201cAmerican dream\u201d in \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d but Churchwell (who herself wrote a book about that novel) cites Fitzgerald\u2019s concluding passage, in which Nick Carraway contemplates how Gatsby\u2019s dream receded into \u201cthe dark fields of the republic,\u201d as a mournful observation of how an expansive vision of \u201chuman potential\u201d had degraded into cupidity.\n\nBy the 1920s, the term \u201cAmerica first\u201d had already gone from isolationism and protectionism to proud internationalism and back to isolationism again. Churchwell finds it in print as early as 1884, when a California newspaper ran an editorial about trade wars with the British. It soon became a slogan for the Republican Party, and then the Democrats, too. President Woodrow Wilson famously invoked it when justifying his refusal to involve the United States in World War I \u2014 and then famously invoked it again when he committed troops to Europe, insisting that \u201cAmerica first\u201d essentially meant that America should take the lead.", "WASHINGTON \u2014 A day after Democrats recaptured the House, Representative Nancy Pelosi, the longtime party leader, promised to work with President Trump and Senate Republicans on issues where they could agree, while vowing the new majority would assert itself when necessary.\n\n\u201cWe have a responsibility to find common ground where we can,\u201d Ms. Pelosi, of California, said Wednesday in an interview. \u201cIf not, we stand our ground.\u201d\n\nIt did not take Mr. Trump long to test Ms. Pelosi\u2019s resolve, abruptly firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Democrats were alarmed, worried that the president was moving toward shutting down the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThe turn of events encapsulated the conflicting pressures on Ms. Pelosi and her new Democratic majority. Voters in traditionally Republican districts in the suburbs joined those in more heavily Democratic communities to elevate Democrats to power as a check on Mr. Trump after he spent the past two years largely unconstrained by a compliant House and Senate led by Republicans.", "I also need to keep myself sane.

The pundit Laura Ingraham, on panel duty for the night, said that if Mr. DeSantis \u201csqueaks out a victory here, I gotta say it\u2019s all Donald Trump who won this for him.\u201d\n\nThe Senate contest in Texas was a big topic on CNN. Working the interactive map known as the Magic Wall, John King wondered aloud whether Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Democrat challenging Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican incumbent, was \u201cpulling off the Texas miracle.\u201d\n\nMr. King also hit on a theme that would harden into conventional wisdom by night\u2019s end: \u201cThe suburbs in America are revolting against President Trump.\u201d\n\n9 PM ET\n\nMSNBC CNN Fox News\n\nFox News broke away from the media pack at 9:33 p.m. with a bold prognostication from the anchor Bret Baier: \u201cWe are now ready to make one of the biggest calls of the night. The Fox News \u2018decision desk\u2019 can now project the Democrats will take control of the House of Representatives for the first time in eight years.\u201d\n\nLed by its polling chief, Arnon Mishkin, Fox News was using a different set of voter data than its rivals \u2014 and it paid off. Chris Wallace said that after taking control of the House, Democrats could open investigations of Mr. Trump. \u201cIt is a very, very big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will be a different Washington.\u201d\n\nWhile Fox News was considering the downside of a flipped House for the president, the mood at the liberal-leaning MSNBC was wary, if not glum. Chris Matthews tried to buck up the mood, predicting that \u201cDemocrats could end up picking up what I would call a wave\u201d by 2 a.m. Toward the end of the hour \u2014 at 9:57 p.m. \u2014 NBC News gave Democrats a 90 percent chance of taking control of the House.\n\nAlso lagging behind Fox News, CNN offered a panel discussion led by Anderson Cooper on the lack of Democratic momentum. \u201cThis is heartbreaking,\u201d said the liberal panelist Van Jones.\n\n10 PM ET\n\nMSNBC CNN Fox News\n\nWith few races to call at the top of the hour, MSNBC resembled the local New York news channel NY1 during a lengthy discussion of transportation infrastructure in the New York tristate area. The proceedings came back to life with the projection that Mr. Cruz had beaten Mr. O\u2019Rourke, a rising Democratic star, and a definitive call that the Democrats would take the House.\n\nFox News had already moved on, informing viewers that Republicans would expand their majority in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that the conservative judicial train will keep running,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. Toward the end of an interview conducted remotely, Mr. Graham went on to warn House Democrats against trying to impeach Mr. Trump: \u201cIt will blow up in their face,\u201d he said.\n\nOn CNN, the graphics were glitzy and the fanfare music blared with each call, but the network\u2019s projections remained cautious, with the anchors deciding against making the call for a Democratic House until\u2026.\n\n11 PM ET\n\nMSNBC CNN Fox News\n\nWolf Blitzer, CNN\u2019s host, finally projected that the Democrats would take the House as the 11 o\u2019clock hour began. He called the development \u201ca very significant defeat for Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nIn a rare cutaway to a scene outside the studio, the correspondent Manu Raju, reporting from Democratic headquarters in Washington, said that party members were already planning to look into the president\u2019s tax returns and his relationships with foreign governments.\n\nMSNBC opened the hour with Mr. Gillum\u2019s concession speech before Ms. Maddow and her team filled the time with educated guesses about how a House under Democratic control might change the country. At Fox News, Mr. Baier and his fellow anchor Martha MacCallum interviewed Florida\u2019s governor-elect, Mr. DeSantis, to discuss his narrow victory.\n\nBack in CNN\u2019s studio, Mr. Jones said that his \u201cheart has been restored\u201d with the \u201cend of one-party rule in the United States, thank God.\u201d", "Thus does the old political camouflage erode \u2014 slowly, but with visible results.\n\nOn Tuesday night (and for some, Wednesday morning), as the election results rolled in and candidates gave their victory or concession speeches, the way that many of them chose to present themselves in that moment was as clear a message about how they meant to go on \u2014 and the split that was about to become the new normal in Washington \u2014 as any of the words they uttered.\n\nYes, I\u2019m talking about what they wore. Starting next term, Congress is going to have something of a new look, not just because of the striking diversity of race and gender in the House, but because of the new attitude toward image and self-definition that goes with that.\n\nIn an era when the president places a premium on \u201ccasting\u201d and has raised the stakes on visual communication, and when he put himself and those ideas at the center of the referendum, it\u2019s part of the story.", "I don\u2019t think Democrats should have voted for Kavanaugh. I do think they should have paid more attention to how their posturing played across the country. Senator Cory Booker\u2019s \u201cSpartacus moment\u201d thrilled some Democrats but hurt the party.\n\nThat\u2019s a risk going forward: Democrats jockeying for the presidential nomination in 2020 will tug the party toward impeachment talk or a blizzard of subpoenas \u2014 in ways that may help Trump. I fear that America\u2019s polarization will worsen in the next couple of years, with increased hate and perhaps violence, and I understand Democrats\u2019 fury at Trump\u2019s role in this. But a spitting rage on the left simply empowers him.\n\nOne lesson from the midterms is that a nominee like Senator Elizabeth Warren might increase the odds of Trump\u2019s re-election. A nominee from beyond the Beltway with experience running things, like Mitch Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor, or the departing Colorado governor, John Hickenlooper, might be a better bet. Or, among senators, Sherrod Brown of Ohio or Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota might have a good shot at winning swing states.\n\nAnd if, as expected, Democrats in the House pick Nancy Pelosi to be speaker, that will be a postelection gift to the Republican Party. That\u2019s unfair but true.\n\nDemocrats should look at referendum results as a glimpse of a road map forward. Three conservative states \u2014 Utah, Nebraska and Idaho \u2014 appear to have voted to expand Medicaid. Two other conservative states, Arkansas and Missouri, raised the minimum wage. And Florida restored voting rights to most people who have completed sentences after felony convictions.\n\nThose outcomes suggest a focus not on \u201cresistance\u201d as such, but on practical ways to improve lives. Swing voters agree with many progressive ideas, from jobs to health care to higher taxes on the wealthy, but Democrats have a knack for antagonizing the working class by coming off as condescending, angry elitists. Democratic leaders understand this and are saying the right things about emphasizing health care costs, infrastructure improvement and cleaning up politics. By all means, stand up to Trump when he demonizes immigrants or separates families, but pick your battles.\n\nOne problem: Many Democrats live in an urban blue bubble, without a single Trump-supporting friend. Ever since the 2016 election, a progressive wing has tarred all Trump voters as racists, idiots and bigots. Not surprisingly, it\u2019s difficult to win votes from people you\u2019re calling bigots.\n\nSo a plea: It\u2019s gratifying to give heroic speeches thundering against fascism, but remember that what makes a difference in people\u2019s lives is winning elections, passing laws and approving judges. To do that, Democrats must engage in less fist-waving and more listening.", "[The Opinion section is now on Instagram.

It\u2019s a bad fit for the character and for Foy, though the fault is scarcely the actress\u2019s. Foy is best known for the Netflix series \u201cThe Crown,\u201d in which she plays the young Queen Elizabeth II, a role that allowed her to express her range with intricate subtlety. She\u2019s cut loose since, going flamboyantly big as a psychiatric patient in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cUnsane.\u201d For \u201cSpider\u2019s Web,\u201d Foy has been tamped down again. This time, though, little nuance seeps through the mask she wears (or her vaguely accented English), for which the filmmakers deserve the blame.\n\nJust don\u2019t take it out on Stieg Larsson, who originated the Millennium trilogy and died in 2004, the year before the first novel was published. The movie is based on the first of two follow-ups by David Lagercrantz, also titled (in English) \u201cThe Girl in the Spider\u2019s Web,\u201d suggesting that this character is too lucrative to ever properly mature to womanhood. A few itsy-bitsy spiders pop up, and Salander spins a web for a very bad man in his own hidey hole, stringing him upside down in the name of, well, something (just don\u2019t call it feminism). From then on, she takes turns playing pursuer or pursued in a tangled tale that brings together old loves, family horrors, state secrets and life on Earth.\n\nA wash of murky hues and murkier narrative developments, the movie was directed by Fede Alvarez, who shares script credit with Jay Basu and Steven Knight. Alvarez tries to pep things up with chases, near escapes, dramatic rescues, fetish wear and female nudity.

Joining Foy in her travails are Sverrir Gudnason as Mikael Blomkvist, Salander\u2019s ally and former lover. Lakeith Stanfield, Stephen Merchant and a badly used Vicky Krieps also drop by for abuse, though their exploitation pales compared with that endured by Salander enthusiasts.", "The Democrats have put together a trillion-dollar infrastructure proposal aimed at everything from broadband to waterways.\n\nBut financing remains a problem. Even if the president and Democrats were willing, Senate Republicans would almost certainly object to any plan large enough to make it worth the Democrats\u2019 while, said Rick Lazio, a former Republican congressman who is now a senior vice president at Alliantgroup, a tax-credit consulting firm. \u201cWith the economy slowing and deficits climbing,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t just see Republicans going for a trillion-dollar infrastructure bill.\u201d\n\nNor is the atmosphere in Washington particularly conducive to cross-the-aisle collaboration. And Democrats may think twice about giving the president a victory before the 2020 election.\n\nA significant slowdown in the economy could always change that calculus. With the effects of the stimulus fading, Mr. Trump has stepped up complaints that the Federal Reserve\u2019s plan to raise interest rates will slow the economy. \u201cIf somebody offers him the opportunity to offset that with a spending bill, he would sign it, with no regard for the deficit,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington who was an adviser to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nWill trade policy change?\n\nMr. Trump has paid little attention to critics in either party in pursuing a confrontational trade policy. The administration has the power to impose tariffs without congressional approval, and that is exactly what it has done. The 10 percent tariff the president put on $250 billion of Chinese goods in late September is scheduled to increase to 25 percent on Jan. 1. The White House has indicated that it will unveil tariffs on all other Chinese imports \u2014 worth an additional $257 billion \u2014 if talks between the United States and China at the G-20 summit this month fail to produce progress.\n\nRestricting the president\u2019s power on trade would require the approval of the House and a 60-vote majority in the Senate. That is unlikely. The Democrats have traditionally been less enamored with free trade than Republicans. (Their views, however, may evolve as the Republican Party under Mr. Trump continues its shift from free-trade orthodoxy to protectionist measures.)\n\nCongress will have the chance to weigh in on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which is to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. The agreement has incorporated a number of provisions \u2014 like higher pay for autoworkers \u2014 that render it somewhat more palatable for the Democrats, Ms. Mays of PwC said.

After that I thought, there\u2019s no point in worrying about it, I\u2019m going to have to go act, and I\u2019m going to have to act in a nontraditional way. Posting a job description and hoping people are going to show up and apply to the job wasn\u2019t working because the people just didn\u2019t exist. So rather than trying to hire the skills and knowing they\u2019re not as easily available, let\u2019s create the skills internally.\u201d\n\nShe created a system open to hiring people who have little or no experience, and, in many cases, even skills, in cybersecurity, with the understanding that they will come in, join a more experienced team and learn on the job. They are formed into teams of five to seven people solving one problem at a time, with the new employees teaming with more experienced security experts to watch.\n\nMany skills from other industries are transferable to the cybersecurity field. Cybersecurity experts need to be able to communicate policies to, as Ms. Naidoo put it, \u201cincrease the cybersecurity I.Q.\u201d of an entire organization. For example, people from a finance background might be able to educate their co-workers in accounting about cyberrisk.\n\nShe\u2019s grown her team by about 25 percent over the last year with developers, consultants and research professionals. She said being more flexible in hiring, and hiring outside of the normal pipeline, had evened out some of the inequities in the field \u2014 like a relative dearth of minorities and women.\n\n\u201cTo solve the skills shortage, we have to hire people who have the right aptitude, who have the right attitude, people who are curious, are willing to learn,\u201d Ms. Naidoo said. \u201cOutside of that, I have very few other criteria. I\u2019m opening the aperture for where we look. I\u2019m trying to hire in nontraditional places, nontraditional groups of people, and so I don\u2019t expect them to have the skills or the experience that we need.

Those states, too, were part of Mr. Trump\u2019s electoral map two years ago and are apt to be critical in 2020. Would the president be unable to win them again? Lou Barletta, the Republican nominee for Senate in Pennsylvania (who lost to the incumbent Democrat Bob Casey), was a staunch immigration restrictionist, just as the president is. But Mr. Barletta ran what was almost universally deemed a poor campaign, and he had nothing of the president\u2019s star power or talent for exploiting an opponent\u2019s weaknesses through well-chosen insults. Democrats\u2019 successes in Pennsylvania suggest little about how a Democratic nominee will perform in the state against Mr. Trump in two years\u2019 time. The same can be said, with a little less confidence, about Democrats\u2019 midterm successes in other Upper Midwest contests.\n\nIn an ordinary midterm election, turnout is low and the opposition party has an advantage, as is reflected in the long chronicle of losses for whichever party holds the White House at the time. In recent decades, only the 1998 and 2002 midterm elections were exceptions in which the president\u2019s party gained seats. It\u2019s easy to see why the president\u2019s party is usually endangered: It has to defend the real record of a real leader, while the opposition party can criticize the president without having to offer an alternative. Strong criticism from one side and a necessarily weaker defense from the other is a formula for gains by the party out of power.\n\nThat was still the case this year. Yet Mr. Trump did something unusual by increasing turnout among his defenders as well as his opponents. Republicans felt that Mr. Trump had an agenda still worth fighting for, and they were heartened that on several key issues \u2014 perhaps most important, judicial appointments \u2014 the president had delivered what he promised. That helped to make Tuesday a good night for political engagement overall, and it kept Republican losses below what they would have been if Mr. Trump had simply been an unpopular and polarizing figure.\n\nMr. Trump made the election a real battle instead of a running retreat. He is indeed widely hated and feared, but he is also much loved as a champion of his voters \u2014 not only by those who are nationalists as the president is but by those, too, who are conventional Republicans who want lower taxes, fewer regulations and more conservative judges. Far from bringing about Mr. Trump\u2019s repudiation, whether by a defeated and regretful right or by the country as a whole, the midterm election has only firmed up the lines of conflict for the future.\n\nPresident Trump will be at the center of that conflict, not as an aberration or departure from the norms of politics but as an integral part of the Republican Party \u2014 its head as well as its right arm.\n\nDaniel McCarthy (@ToryAnarchist) is the editor of Modern Age: A Conservative Quarterly.\n\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.", "Ebo\u2019s story is told in flashbacks, beginning with his later journey across the Mediterranean and then alternating with his earlier trek across Africa.

The complete package is a highly accessible introduction to the plight of all refugees.\n\nThe surprising reunions at the end of \u201cNowhere Boy\u201d and \u201cIllegal\u201d give us the taste of hope. But hope is relative. Like Holocaust victims, our main characters lose entire families during their journeys: a situation so desperately grim, and so unthinkable, that one single other survivor constitutes a happy miracle. When a story doesn\u2019t end in the worst-case scenario, the death of the main character, it fools us into thinking that losing your home and most of your family can have a happy ending.\n\nImage From \u201cZenobia.\u201d\n\nThere is no such miracle in the graphic novel ZENOBIA (Seven Stories, 94 pp., $19.95; ages 11 and up), written by Morten D\u00fcrr and illustrated by Lars Horneman. \u201cZenobia\u201d is not so much a novel as a fable, a vignette in a lost life. Amina is a Syrian child whose parents vanish (presumably killed in the war that we see shattering her city) and who attempts to leave her devastated and war-torn home with her uncle. The fragile ship Amina boards for the Mediterranean crossing to Europe, like that of Ahmed and Ebo, is lost at sea.\n\nZenobia was a warrior queen who united Syria and conquered surrounding civilizations in ancient times. Amina uses her national hero\u2019s name as an inspiration for strength and courage, even in the moment of her death. The legacy of Zenobia is Amina\u2019s only comfort on her pointless journey; but is it pointless if we learn from it? \u201cZenobia\u201d highlights, with simple clarity, Syria\u2019s noble historical legacy as well as the plight of its modern people. Amina\u2019s short and tragic story, inspired no doubt by 2015\u2019s searing media image of the drowned Syrian child Alan Kurdi, is harrowing and instructive.\n\nIf there is a single moment from these books that will prove impossible to forget, it is the full-page spread in \u201cIllegal\u201d in which Ebo\u2019s drowned brother drifts lifeless beneath the sea, surrounded by the other lifeless bodies of friends and strangers, fish nibbling at their exposed skin. This image, shocking and moving, represents the theme of wasted life that runs through all three books \u2014 a memorial to the dead and, to the unstoppable living, a call to action.", "ROME \u2014 At a police convention in October, Matteo Salvini, the most powerful figure in Italy\u2019s populist government, ran his hands over an enormous military-grade sniper rifle and posed with a submachine gun.

However, like millions of other Americans, I had this strange two-year nightmare: Donald Trump was actually elected president.\n\nI think that we are all about to wake up from the Trump nightmare, as the recent election has made certain that at least one house of Congress will check his power and that the principles of our democracy and the values of our country remain strong.

Our 13-year-old son, who usually loves going, was hesitant about the trip this year, but he wouldn\u2019t say why. So, we asked his older sister to investigate; they\u2019re close. She told us his reluctance has to do with a family deer hunt that the men and boys go on the morning after the holiday.

Given the frequency of tragedies, it\u2019s only natural for kids to be anxious, even if they never bring the subject up. (It\u2019s often the scariest things we don\u2019t talk about.) Ask your son: Is it hunting that bothers you, or guns in general? How do you cope with your feelings? What can we do to help?\n\nThe fact that he confided in his sister suggests that he may be ready to explore his feelings. An open conversation with you and his mother may be useful for both kids.

Democratic victories in governors\u2019 races also improved the chances of Medicaid expansion in Kansas and Wisconsin, and all but ensured it in Maine. As a result, Medicaid could see its biggest enrollment bump since the health law began allowing expansion in 2014.\n\nFor all the campaign warfare over the health law\u2019s effect on insurance premiums and protections for people with pre-existing conditions, Medicaid has remained quite popular. In a Kaiser poll last month, 56 percent of people across the 17 states that had not yet expanded Medicaid said they favored doing so. And the share of people saying Medicaid was \u201cvery important\u201d to them grew to nearly half during efforts to repeal the health law last year, Kaiser found.\n\n\u201cMedicaid per se is much more popular than the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Robert Blendon, a health policy expert at Harvard who has closely followed public opinion of the health law. \u201cAnd the people organizing these referendums on Medicaid expansion aren\u2019t making them about the A.C.A. They\u2019re taking a program that\u2019s been in the state for years and adding to it, saying, \u2018All these other people need coverage and we can get outside money for it.\u2019\u201d", "bad url", "Good morning on this radiant Wednesday.\n\nIt has been a bruising, expensive and drawn-out election season here in New York, and it finally came to an end last night.\n\nHere are the big takeaways.\n\nAndrew M. Cuomo slides to victory\n\nMr. Cuomo won a third time in the race for governor of New York, easily beating his Republican rival, Marcus Molinaro. He ran on his record, which includes same sex-marriage, gun control measures and paid family leave. Just like his father, Mr. Cuomo won a third term as governor, and just like his father, he has denied that he has presidential ambitions.\n\n[Read more about Mr. Cuomo\u2019s win.]\n\nDemocrats take New York seats in the House\n\nNew York State had nine incumbent House Republicans, out of 27 total House representatives. Yesterday, three of those Republicans lost their seats. The most notable was John J. Faso, a Republican who represented New York\u2019s 19th Congressional District, whom Antonio Delgado defeated. Here in the city, Max Rose defeated Representative Dan Donovan in Staten Island, and in central New York, Anthony Brindisi beat Representative Claudia Tenney.\n\nDemocrats seize control of the State Senate\n\nDemocrats won control of the New York State Senate for the first time in nearly a decade. The Democratic senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins is slated to become the next majority leader, which would make her the first black woman to lead the Senate, and the first woman to lead the State Senate or Assembly.", "(Want to get this briefing by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\n\nGood morning.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\nElections leave a divided Congress\n\nDemocrats gained control of the House and several important governorships in the midterm elections on Tuesday, most likely presenting President Trump with a considerably more hostile political environment for the remainder of his term.\n\nRepublicans, however, looked set to increase their one-seat majority in the Senate and extended dominance of several swing states crucial to Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign. Here\u2019s our full story on the voting, as well as four key takeaways.\n\n\u2022 The numbers: We have the latest results from the House, the Senate, and for governorships and other state positions.\n\n\u2022 News analysis: The blue wave that Democrats had hoped for didn\u2019t fully materialize, but voters sent a clear message that they want checks on Mr. Trump, our congressional correspondent writes.", "It was a mood reflected in much of Manhattan. At my polling place \u2014 appropriately enough, the Alfred E. Smith School on the Upper West Side, named for New York\u2019s original \u201cHappy Warrior\u201d \u2014 lines were longer than I had seen them on any Election Day save for the Obama-McCain election of 2008. This time the feeling in the lines was entirely different from that day ten years ago, and not just because the balmy sunshine had been replaced by rain. My fellow voters seemed grimly determined, quietly set on delivering a message even though there were no competitive races (or competitive Republicans) on the ballot.\n\nSo where are we and where do we go from here?\n\nA tip that Mr. Trump should take from a much better politician than himself, the man who did pull off the impossible, is that there are times to get off the stage. Even when things were going well, Franklin Roosevelt liked to say, periodically, that it was time for him to disappear \u2014 to keep a low profile, get out of the public eye and go fishing, even in that much less media-freighted era. No one wants a president in her face all the time, and no TV show is on every night.\n\nIt is not advice Mr. Trump will take. Even on election night, he was giving himself full credit in his tweets for what he called a \u201ctremendous success\u201d and retweeting what the writer Ben Stein had said about him, namely that \u201cMr. Trump has magic about him. He has magic coming out of his ears. He is an astonishing vote-getter and campaigner.\u201d\n\nWell, the magical Mr. Trump has become a permanent low-pressure system hovering over us, dominating our conversation, filling our airwaves, distracting us from exercising our great right to be left alone. But he is constitutionally incapable of giving up the tweet-glow, and so will likely exhaust even his most devoted followers in the end.\n\nRegarding those followers: we have all been told, over and over again, by one expert after another from nearly every possible spot on the political spectrum that none of us must ever, ever talk down to these, our fellow Americans, or criticize their choice of Mr. Trump in any way, lest we further alienate them.\n\nFine. I will say this then: listen to yourselves. Listen to your experience, to that little voice in your heart or in your head, to what you can recall of what used to be acceptable presidential behavior in this country. It will tell you that this is not a fit man to be president, in any way whatsoever. It will tell you that this is not what you have to settle for, that you yourselves can do better in choosing someone else, no matter how often you have been disappointed in the past.\n\nFor Democrats, this campaign had its own heartbreaks: Beto O\u2019Rourke, Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum losing to three of the most obnoxious candidates in the race. The wrenchingly narrow failure to knock the likes of Steve King or Chris Collins out of the House. And of course, Republicans keeping the Senate means not only that Mr. Trump will have something to brag about (when does he not?) but that he can jam through as many appointments \u2014 particularly judicial appointments \u2014 as he likes, perhaps starting with a replacement for Justice Clarence Thomas at a politically convenient moment like, say, 2020.", "DAKAR, Senegal \u2014 Dozens of students kidnapped from a boarding school in a restive region of Cameroon were freed late Tuesday after being held hostage for about two days, according to local and military officials.\n\nThe circumstances of the mass kidnapping were mired in confusion, but more than 70 teenage students were dropped off at the campus of their Presbyterian Secondary School by masked men around 11 p.m., said Samuel Fonki, a pastor in Bamenda who works with the school.\n\nHe added that no ransom had been paid for the release of the children, who were taken sometime Sunday or Monday from their campus in Nkwen, a small village outside Bamenda, where separatists are waging a violent battle for independence from Cameroon.\n\nMr. Fonki said the students all appeared healthy and were immediately taken to security forces for questioning. He said a teacher and a principal were still being held captive, but military officials indicated that all hostages were freed. It remains unclear who abducted the hostages, but the military said they had been abandoned by their captors after the area was sealed off by soldiers.", "Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night\u2019s highlights that lets you sleep \u2014 and lets us get paid to watch comedy.

They brimmed with confidence about their capacity to push for a new moral, ethical and social framework in tech.

Among the items flying off the shelves were a potent sativa strain that gives people a \u201ccreative and social buzz,\u201d and pre-rolled joints, he said.\n\nAfter waiting two weeks to get a new cannabis shipment, he said he had been forced to shutter the store for a week. He said he and his mother had invested about 100,000 Canadian dollars in the shop and were struggling to pay their bills.\n\nHis suppliers, who are licensed by the provincial government, had told him that they had underestimated demand. The store, which has now reopened, is trying to scrape by with the sales of paraphernalia like bongs and rolling papers. But Mr. Tobin said it was not enough for the business to be profitable.", "Still there will most be a push for even more: There is already chatter about legalizing recreational marijuana; investing more in the crumbling subways; addressing climate change; and installing an early voting system for the first time, all ideas that the governor has previously offered differing degrees of support for.\n\nAnd after a tumultuous primary season in which liberal challengers ousted seven more moderate Democratic state senators, the virtual Holy Grail of current progressive thought seems within reach: a state-run universal health care system. Mr. Cuomo stopped short of fully embracing the proposal, saying it \u201chas merit.\u201d\n\nAndrea Stewart-Cousins, who is slated to become the first woman and first female African-American to lead the New York State Senate, also struck a note of caution about the Democratic agenda. \u201cYou eat the elephant one issue at a time,\u201d she said on Tuesday, as votes began to roll in for her party.\n\nThere also will likely be, of course, intraparty differences. The Senate that Ms. Stewart-Cousins will lead is very likely to contain several factions, including New York City liberals and more moderate members from the city\u2019s suburbs. Fifteen of her members will be new to Albany, and its vagaries, with many of that cohort never before having held public office \u2014 or, in some cases, even having an office.\n\n[What drove the rogue group of Senate Democrats to work with Republicans? Read more here.]\n\nGustavo Rivera, a Democratic state senator from the Bronx, said that Democrats had failed to keep the trust of voters during their brief time in charge nearly a decade ago and know they must do better this time.\n\n\u201cGoverning is a very complicated matter,\u201d Mr. Rivera said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just giving raises to your staff and getting nicer offices.\u201d", "The family with school-age children\n\nYou\u2019re looking to get away with the entire family, but are somewhat hemmed in by school vacations and swim practice. You\u2019ll likely need to pounce the moment a good deal arises. Another wrinkle: You\u2019re competing with thousands of other parents who are looking to get away at the same time, which will likely include the week between Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day.\n\nSet your price alerts\n\nSites like Kayak, Skyscanner, Hopper and Google Flights have alerts that will track flight prices and notify you of changes. On the flight results page, simply elect to track or follow the prices, and you\u2019ll receive email or mobile phone notifications. Hopper and Kayak will even advise you on the results page whether to buy tickets now, or wait for a better deal.\n\nIf you\u2019re watching a particular route or date range closely, I recommend enabling push notifications on your phone \u2014 when prices drop, they don\u2019t always last very long. Hopper and Kayak also allow you to set alerts hotel rooms, in addition to flights.\n\nTarget places with deals for children\n\nVacationing with children can certainly be expensive. A ski vacation needn\u2019t burden the wallet, however, given the number of opportunities for kids to get free lift tickets or ones at a greatly reduced cost. In New York , third and fourth graders can receive three free lift tickets from a selection of over two dozen resorts in the state ( and you don\u2019t have to be from New York to take advantage of this ). The program, through I Ski NY, grants eligible children the free tickets with the purchase of adult tickets (there is a $27 processing fee). Several other states, including Pennsylvania, Utah and Vermont, have similar programs that grant children\u2019s lift tickets for a nominal fee when applied for ahead of time.\n\nIndividual resorts have their own deals, as well. At June Mountain, near Yosemite National Park, children aged 12 and under always receive free lift tickets. Keystone Resort in Colorado allows children 12 and under to ski for free with a stay of two nights or longer. The popular Mammoth Mountain isn\u2019t quite as generous, but even they have a deal: children age 4 and under, and seniors 80 and above ski for free.\n\nBook early\n\nWhile many early-bird, ski-package specials have deadlines in the summer, it\u2019s not too late to find a deal for booking early. Even popular resorts like Whistler Blackcomb and Aspen Snowmass offer reduced lodging rates for those who are willing to make a commitment. When you know you\u2019re working with firm dates, it can be a good idea to book as far in advance as possible.", "He prefers to focus on the dilemmas, successes and struggles of particular Asian-Americans, including Cho; Eddie Huang, the rebel celebrity chef; and Amy Chua, the notorious tiger mom. While he admires Huang more than Chua, he considers both to be resolute individualists who refuse to back down when faced with the disapproval of Asian-Americans or Americans as a whole. They know who they are, even if who they are happens to be contradictory and provocative. This self-assertion \u2014 or brashness \u2014 makes them characteristically American.\n\nImage\n\nCho represents the flip side of their success, and Yang\u2019s essay on the shooter, which was first published in n + 1 in 2008 and established Yang as a writer to reckon with, remains his best work, probably because here he comes face to face with himself most vividly. Cho was an Asian-American man whose depression and rage appeared to be tied to his misogyny and his experience of being rejected by women. Contemplating Cho, Yang says: \u201cThe Asian man knows something of the resentment of the embattled white man \u2026 and something of the resentments of the rising social-justice warrior. \u2026 Tasting of the frustrations of both, he is denied the entitlements of either.\u201d\n\nCho was an extreme manifestation of this resentful, racialized masculinity, and Yang confesses an ambivalent kinship with him as an \u201cunlovable\u201d man himself. Looking at Cho\u2019s face, Yang feels \u201ca very personal revulsion. \u2026 Those lugubrious eyes, that elongated face behind wire-frame glasses: He looks like me.\u201d This is the emotional crux of the book, one Yang barely pursues beyond this essay. If Yang had pressed further in examining himself or other Asian-Americans, he might have been able to develop a new approach to the Asian-American condition, one that addressed the hatreds and self-hatreds born from racism and internalized racism.\n\nThe older approach to this problem emerged after 1968, when radical college students coined the term \u201cAsian-American.\u201d Being \u201cAsian-American\u201d meant being anti-imperialist, antiwar, antiracist and anticapitalist. If racism harmed you as an individual, the solution was both to change yourself, by developing a political consciousness, and to undertake collective action, by attacking racism and everything related to it. That legacy of merging individual and collective transformation still exists today in nonprofit organizations, grass-roots activism, some campus student groups and even among some elected politicians, including Jane Kim, who serves on San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors, and the California congresswoman Judy Chu.\n\nThis Asian-American legacy in politics and art is invisible to Yang, who does not even mention Frank Chin, the writer who most forcefully dealt with the agonies of Asian-American manhood. Chin, who connected racial emasculation to the treatment of Asian-Americans as objects of \u201cracist love\u201d (as opposed to the \u201cracist hate\u201d directed against African-Americans), argued that Asian-American writing had to be a form of fighting. Yang flails rather than fights, which suggests that there is something inadequate about the Asian-American legacy for him. He may not be alone. His neglect of historical forebears and his almost exclusive focus on the personal is indicative of a generational shift in Asian-American thinking; revolution is not very fashionable today.", "The rise of athletic sportswear and the mainstreaming of once marginal street wear labels have given the trend its latest push, propelling it to the catwalks, where it has thrived intermittently for a number of years. Still, given their erratic up and down trajectory, logos by now should again be heading for the tacky airport shop or the outlet mall.\n\nSo it seems perverse that fashion\u2019s love affair with splashy status badges shows no signs of cooling. Logos raced like a contagion through the spring 2019 collections, breaking out on camp shirts and chain belts at Chanel, on hosiery and sneakers at Prada, on epaulets at Balenciaga and spreading over entire ensembles at Gucci, the luxury house that has been widely credited with lending this trend its impetus.\n\n\u201cRight now,\u201d said Anna Ross, the associate women\u2019s wear editor at WGSN, a trend forecasting service, \u201cthere seems to be no expiration date.\u201d\n\nSo what gives logos their staying power?\n\nFor starters, the look is being reimagined in a way that speaks expressly to the young. \u201cChanel, Fendi and others have obviously seen a huge amount of social currency in appealing to a millennials and Generation Z,\u201d Ms. Ross said. Those bands of streetwise consumers flaunt initialed T-shirts, boots, sneakers, belts and totes with a dash of irony.\n\n\u201cFor a brand, this may not be the most subtle marketing strategy,\u201d she added, \u201cbut companies see that it\u2019s working.\u201d\n\nFendi, t aking a page from street wear, plans to drop limited-edition logo-stamped products at regular intervals. \u201cWe like the idea of limited editions,\u201d said Silvia Venturini Fendi, the creative director of accessories and men\u2019s wear at the label. \u201cYounger consumers like that you can get the item, then its gone, making way for something new. For us, it\u2019s a way of not being predictable.\u201d", "If the placebo was as powerful as Beecher said, and if doctors wanted to know whether their drugs actually worked, it was not sufficient simply to give patients the drugs and see whether they did better than patients who didn\u2019t interact with the doctor at all. Instead, researchers needed to assume that the placebo effect was part of every drug effect, and that drugs could be said to work only to the extent that they worked better than placebos. An accurate measure of drug efficacy would require comparing the response of patients taking it with that of patients taking placebos; the drug effect could then be calculated by subtracting the placebo response from the overall response, much as a deli-counter worker subtracts the weight of the container to determine how much lobster salad you\u2019re getting.\n\nIn the last half of the 1950s, this calculus gave rise to a new way to evaluate drugs: the double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, in which neither patient nor clinician knew who was getting the active drug and who the placebo. In 1962, when the Food and Drug Administration began to require pharmaceutical companies to prove their new drugs were effective before they came to market, they increasingly turned to the new method; today, virtually every prospective new drug has to outperform placebos on two independent studies in order to gain F.D.A. approval.\n\nLike Franklin\u2019s commission, the F.D.A. had determined that the only way to sort out the real from the fake in medicine was to isolate the imagination. It also echoed the royal panel by taking note of the placebo effect only long enough to dismiss it, giving it a strange dual nature: It\u2019s included in clinical trials because it is recognized as an important part of every treatment, but it is treated as if it were not important in itself. As a result, although virtually every clinical trial is a study of the placebo effect, it remains underexplored \u2014 an outcome that reflects the fact that there is no money in sugar pills and thus no industry interest in the topic as anything other than a hurdle it needs to overcome.\n\nWhen Ted Kaptchuk was asked to give the opening keynote address at the conference in Leiden, he contemplated committing the gravest heresy imaginable: kicking off the inaugural gathering of the Society for Interdisciplinary Placebo Studies by declaring that there was no such thing as the placebo effect. When he broached this provocation in conversation with me not long before the conference, it became clear that his point harked directly back to Franklin: that the topic he and his colleagues studied was created by the scientific establishment, and only in order to exclude it \u2014 which means that they are always playing on hostile terrain. Science is \u201cdesigned to get rid of the husks and find the kernels,\u201d he told me. Much can be lost in the threshing \u2014 in particular, Kaptchuk sometimes worries, the rituals embedded in the doctor-patient encounter that he thinks are fundamental to the placebo effect, and that he believes embody an aspect of medicine that has disappeared as scientists and doctors pursue the course laid by Franklin\u2019s commission. \u201cMedical care is a moral act,\u201d he says, in which a suffering person puts his or her fate in the hands of a trusted healer.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t love science,\u201d Kaptchuk told me. \u201cI want to know what heals people.\u201d Science may not be the only way to understand illness and healing, but it is the established way. \u201cThat\u2019s where the power is,\u201d Kaptchuk says. That instinct is why he left his position as director of a pain clinic in 1990 to join Harvard \u2014 and it\u2019s why he was delighted when, in 2010, he was contacted by Kathryn Hall, a molecular biologist. Here was someone with an interest in his topic who was also an expert in molecules, and who might serve as an emissary to help usher the placebo into the medical establishment.\n\nHall\u2019s own journey into placebo studies began 15 years before her meeting with Kaptchuk, when she developed a bad case of carpal tunnel syndrome. Wearing a wrist brace didn\u2019t help, and neither did over-the-counter drugs or the codeine her doctor prescribed. When a friend suggested she visit an acupuncturist, Hall balked at the idea of such an unscientific approach. But faced with the alternative, surgery, she decided to make an appointment. \u201cI was there for maybe 10 minutes,\u201d she recalls, \u201cwhen she stuck a needle here\u201d \u2014 Hall points to a spot on her forearm \u2014 \u201cand this awful pain just shot through my arm.\u201d But then the pain receded and her symptoms disappeared, as if they had been carried away on the tide. She received a few more treatments, during which the acupuncturist taught her how to manipulate a spot near her elbow if the pain recurred. Hall needed the fix from time to time, but the problem mostly just went away.", "In 1996, Microsoft unleashed Clippit, better known as Clippy, on users of Microsoft Office. The legendarily irritating mascot-helper spent the following years hovering around the edges of documents, blinking dumbly under his lascivious eyebrows and blurting out, \u201cIt looks like you\u2019re writing a letter,\u201d until he was sidelined by the company in 2001, officially recognized as a mistake. Clippy\u2019s problems were manifold. He announced his presence, via a personified avatar, to tell us something that we already knew (or that should have been obvious in the first place) and then proudly offered us little in the way of actual help. He sat and watched us and learned nothing, and repeated himself. He said too much and did too little.\n\nNevertheless, over 20 years later, the spawn of Clippy are hiding everywhere, guessing what we\u2019re trying to do and offering to help. But Clippy\u2019s successors are doing their best to avoid his mistakes. Most of the time they are faceless, and if they speak, they do so in a disembodied but humanlike voice. They tend to wait to be asked for help, rather than telling us what they think they know unprompted. And when they do offer help, they tend to be more subtle, more accurate or both. They have perhaps more in common with Clippy\u2019s unassuming partners, like Spelling and Grammar Check or AutoCorrect, which spoke through red underlines or small actions carried out on reasonable assumptions (who would intentionally type \u201cteh\u201d?). These tools have followed us and our clumsy fingers to our new smartphones, where they have become both more assertive and more useful, correcting us and only occasionally requiring us to correct them back, and learning all the while.\n\nWhat does the tech industry want to assist us with now? Email. If you use Gmail, you\u2019ve probably interacted with either Smart Reply or Smart Compose, whether or not you know them by name. Google introduced Smart Reply in 2015, and Smart Compose began rolling out this year. Both, in execution, are self-explanatory. Smart Reply suggests canned responses to inbound emails, based on the company\u2019s best guess at what most emailers might be about to type. The suggestions are short, peppy and often adequate, at least as a start. Sometimes their tone prompts unhappy realizations about what Gmail sees in us. The frequency with which they use exclamation marks emphasizes just how peculiar the language of professional email communication has become (\u201cSounds great!\u201d \u201cVery cool!\u201d \u201cLove it!\u201d). Smart Compose, in contrast, offers word and phrase suggestions, based on similar judgments, as the user types in real time. You write \u201cTake a look,\u201d and ghostly text might appear to its right: \u201cand let me know what you think.\u201d Its assumptions are more personalized, and they feel that way because it is constantly, visibly, guessing what you\u2019re thinking.\n\nSmart Compose and Smart Reply are, at their core, artificial-intelligence technologies: They are programmed to perform tasks, but also to adapt. To start, Smart Reply was trained on publicly available bodies of email text. (Among the most widely used for such projects is the cache of some 500,000 emails collected during the discovery phase of the Enron investigation.) \u201cWhat makes machine learning different from regular programming is you look at corpuses of data to make guesses about things,\u201d says Paul Lambert, a product manager for Gmail. \u201cYou create a model.\u201d", "Silk scarf tied around her neck just so, Caveri proudly showed off her marble mortar, which her great-grandmother acquired sometime before 1870. And then we got to work. She started with a handful of pine nuts, left raw to preserve the faint sweetness that recedes with toasting. With the kind of elegance only a chic Italian grandmother can lend to bashing small, slippery nuts, she pounded them into a paste that resembled a pale, creamy peanut butter. Then she added a couple handfuls of tender Genovese basil leaves, a clove of garlic and some coarse salt to provide the friction needed to break everything down. She kept pounding and grinding. As the basil disintegrated, releasing its exquisite aroma, the sauce began to transform in a way I\u2019d never seen. Before Caveri had even added any olive oil, the oil from the nuts began to blend with the minuscule amounts of water the basil leaves released. The constant rap of the pestle jostled the two into a emulsion, neither oil nor water but a creamy third thing made of both. I\u2019d only ever considered pesto to be a cousin of herb salsa, made of distinct ingredients, each broken down separately and then combined into a loose, oily condiment. But the way Caveri was working everything together in the mortar at once, I realized pesto was something else entirely: a thick, creamy sauce.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a question of patience,\u201d Caveri, 73, said in Italian, continuing to pound and stir with the pestle as the afternoon sunlight bounced off her rings. She confessed that my request for a cooking lesson had prompted her to resume using her mortaio after years of using a blender, or buying prepared sauce. \u201cNo one makes pesto like this anymore,\u201d she said. Caveri\u2019s soft hums of pleasure, a sign of approval in the universal language of grandmothers, made my heart jump.\n\nNext, we stirred in the cheeses \u2014 two parts Parmesan to one part saltier pecorino \u2014 and began to drizzle in oil Caveri and her family pressed from homegrown olives a month or so earlier. Caveri never stopped stirring, and the pesto continued to reveal just how creamy it could get. We tasted for salt, cheese and garlic, but the sauce didn\u2019t need much tweaking \u2014 it was extraordinary. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to give me satisfaction,\u201d Caveri said, using a phrase that\u2019s indescribably more meaningful in Italian than in English. I beamed. The entire process took about eight minutes. Maybe 10. The pot of pasta water we put on before we started hadn\u2019t even come to a boil yet. Once it did, we cooked trofie, the corkscrew shaped pasta traditionally paired with pesto in Liguria, and stirred in spoonfuls of sauce, a little pasta water and a few more drops of Caveri\u2019s oil. As we mixed it all together, the thick sauce coated the noodles in a way I\u2019d never seen pesto do. I took a bite. It tasted as it looked \u2014 like a unified whole, greater than the sum of its parts. Whereas every other pesto I\u2019d ever eaten gradually separated into its individual components as I made my way through a bowl of pasta, leaving a puddle of flavored olive oil behind, this sauce \u2014 creamy, nutty, fragrant and sweet \u2014 clung to the trofie. It was a revelation.\n\nI knew then that I could never make pesto any other way. In the year since, the mortar has taken up permanent residence on my countertop, and I haven\u2019t been tempted once by the food processor. I recently visited Caveri again, and asked if she\u2019d been converted as well. \u201cI prefer the mortar,\u201d she said. \u201cIt enhances the scent of the basil and garlic. But when my whole family \u2014 more than 20 of us \u2014 gather, I do give in to the temptation of the blender.\u201d", "The exercisers\u2019 weekly program consisted of unsupervised walking or jogging, with the aim of working out for at least 20 minutes a day and ideally for 40 minutes or more. Once a week they also visited the university for several hours of instruction and a group workout.\n\nMeanwhile, the mindfulness group was learning to meditate, following a standard mindfulness instruction program that focuses on attending to the present moment and checking in on how your body feels. The people in this group practiced body scans and mindful walking, in addition to the usual quiet, seated meditations. Like those in the exercise group, they attended a weekly session on campus, but most of their meditations were completed at home.\n\nBoth of these programs lasted for two months, which, in this study, took people through September and October and into the early days of November.\n\nThen, with winter on the horizon, the volunteers, including those in the control group, wore an activity monitor for another week. None of them knew that the study\u2019s aim was to track their activities; they thought it was looking at colds.\n\nBut the two programs did seem to have had an influence, according to data from the monitors. Most noticeably, the men and the women in the control group were much less active now, in the late fall, than they had been in the summer, averaging almost 18 fewer minutes a day of walking and otherwise moving about.\n\nBut the men and women in the other two groups had not become quite so inactive, although they were no longer being asked to exercise or meditate. They were moving a bit less than they had been in the summertime, but only by about six minutes a day.\n\nThese results surprised the researchers, says Jacob Meyer, an assistant professor of kinesiology at Iowa State, who conducted the study with Bruce Barrett and other colleagues. They had expected the exercise program to get people familiar with and interested in the idea of moving, he says. \u201cBut we did not expect the mindfulness training to have the effect that it had,\u201d he says.", "The clean, well-lighted place is glowing.

Ms. Pelosi made clear her party would only bend so far. Democrats are not \u201cgoing to lowest common denominator to get a presidential signature,\u201d she said.\n\nRepresentative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, Ms. Pelosi\u2019s longtime No. 2, said Mr. Trump\u2019s stances would speak for themselves to 2020 voters. \u201cThe best politics for us is trying to work toward adopting the best policy for the American people,\u201d he added.\n\nAs they talked up possible bipartisan initiatives, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Hoyer said that Democrats would push through \u2014 on party-line votes if necessary \u2014 other more liberal agenda items they say enjoy broad public support but have been stymied for years by Republican majorities. They include gun safety legislation; a bill to give permanent legal status and a path to citizenship to young, undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children; and the Equality Act, which would amend longstanding civil rights laws to extend legal protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nMs. Pelosi said that she would urge her caucus to revive a select committee focused on climate change, similar to the one that Democrats financed from 2007 to early 2011, to \u201cprepare the way with evidence\u201d for energy conservation and other climate change mitigation legislation. Republicans defunded the panel when they took the majority, but Ms. Pelosi said it was clearly still needed to educate the public about the impact of more frequent extreme weather events.\n\n\u201cThe template for 2020 is getting built in the House,\u201d said Representative Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona, a progressive in line to chair the Natural Resources Committee, summing up another Democratic view.\n\nDemocrats have also prepared detailed, more liberal approaches for a $1 trillion infrastructure package and how to slow the increases in prescription drug costs, but indicated that they would steer proposals through the regular committee process in an effort to try to build a consensus with Republicans first. Mr. Hoyer said Democrats and Republicans would disagree over how to fund infrastructure spending, but they could bridge the gap with Mr. Trump\u2019s help.\n\nAt least in theory, Democrats view election and ethics reform as another issue of potential collaboration. But their legislative package of more than a dozen bills, overseen by Representative John Sarbanes of Maryland, looks more like a retort to Mr. Trump\u2019s popular campaign claims that he would \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington \u2014 a difference Democrats have weaponized on the campaign trail.", "Many of the candidates for the House who turned red seats blue were people of color. I think of Antonio Delgado in New York, whose blackness was something that Republicans dwelled on. I think of Colin Allred in Texas, who defeated a previously invincible Republican, Pete Sessions, who has been in Congress for two decades. I think of Lauren Underwood in Illinois, who was making her first bid for political office and wasn\u2019t initially given much of a chance. She proved the naysayers wrong.\n\nAllred and Underwood are in their 30s, which speaks to another theme in the Democratic takeover of House: the number of young candidates behind it. Nancy Pelosi, 78, may be poised for a new stint as the Speaker of the House, but what happened among Democratic candidates throughout the country on Tuesday represented a changing of the guard and a diversifying of the ranks.\n\nIn a bellwether House race in Kansas, Sharice Davids defeated the Republican incumbent, Kevin Yoder. She\u2019s 38, openly gay and will be one of the first Native American women in Congress. The other, also elected on Tuesday, is Deb Haaland, a New Mexico Democrat.\n\nAh, Kansas: Trump won the state in 2016 by more than 20 points, but on Tuesday, in the governor\u2019s race there, Kansans rejected a far-right candidate who was a darling of the president\u2019s \u2014 Kris Kobach \u2014 for a Democratic woman, Laura Kelly.\n\nShe won handily, and Democrats picked up other governorships that had belonged to Republicans, for instance in Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin, where Scott Walker was denied a third term. Democrats will now govern all three states \u2014 Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2014 that handed Trump his margin of victory in the Electoral College.\n\nI can look at the way Trump has governed \u2014 unabashedly spreading hate, gleefully shattering norms and sowing chaos at every turn \u2014 and wonder why more didn\u2019t go Democrats\u2019 way on Tuesday. I can tally their possible mistakes. Too many Democrats still haven\u2019t figured out the difference between talking to and talking down to Americans, and too many engage in a kind of oppression Olympics that turns off voters in the middle.\n\nBut on Tuesday, in House elections, Democrats prevailed among independents. They prevailed in suburbs. They prevailed in swing districts with candidates who showed plenty of prudent moderation.", "They marched, they ran, and on Election Day, they won.\n\nWomen led a parade of victories and unexpected upsets Tuesday to win control of the House for the Democrats.\n\nIt was the culmination of two years of anger, frustration and activism driven by women appalled by Donald J. Trump\u2019s election and presidency. Women poured into grass-roots groups determined to regain Democratic control of Congress and flooded organizations that trained them to run for office. As candidates, women broke the rules and upended conventional political wisdom. As activists, they expanded the definition of women\u2019s issues beyond education and reproductive rights to include health care, immigration, gun violence and the environment.\n\nIt was a litany of historic firsts, most of them by Democrats: In Massachusetts, Ayanna Pressley became the first woman of color in her state\u2019s congressional delegation. Rashida Tlaib in Michigan and Ilhan Omar in Minnesota will be the first Muslim women in Congress. Sharice Davids toppled a Republican man in Kansas and Deb Haaland prevailed in New Mexico, becoming the first Native American women elected to Congress. In Tennessee, Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, became the state\u2019s first woman elected to the Senate.\n\nBut several prominent women were also defeated \u2014 Senator Claire McCaskill lost to Josh Hawley in Missouri, Amy McGrath lost a closely watched House race in Kentucky, and Senator Heidi Heitkamp lost her re-election race in North Dakota.

People will say that the campaign was disorganized, more focused on the candidate\u2019s winning personality than real issues. That Mr. O\u2019Rourke let Mr. Cruz define him, instead of the opposite \u2014 and Mr. Cruz did just that, painting Mr. O\u2019Rourke as a far-left-wing nut who would let terrorists cross the Rio Grande and endanger the lives of God-fearing Texans.

Two years of chaos and hysteria ending in a return to stalemate.\n\nBetween their Senate gains and a few surprising gubernatorial victories Republicans probably have enough consolation prizes to feel O.K. about the outcome. Trump critics on the right will feel a little better than O.K., since now the House can check and investigate our morally challenged president while the Senate keeps confirming conservative judges.\n\nBut this election confirms that, contra certain Trump enthusiasts, the #MAGA era in right-wing politics is essentially a defensive era, in which G.O.P. leverages a fortunate Electoral College win and an advantage in the Senate to fill the courts and delay liberal ambitions for a time \u2014 but fails, conspicuously, to reap political rewards from the current economic expansion and to build an actual popular majority.\n\nInstead, after its nominee traded a lot of suburban voters for stronger working-class support in 2016, the Trump-era Republican Party has continued to hemorrhage suburbanites while also giving back some of those Midwestern, blue-collar gains. The political strategy for Republicans after Trump\u2019s victory should have been obvious: Seal the working-class realignment with a dose of economic populism, hold the suburbs by dialing back the Trumpian excesses.

But among all the members of the bountiful ensemble directed by Richard Curtis in this Christmas-themed romantic comedy (Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson and Liam Neeson among them), a younger Lincoln stands out thanks to a scene involving Keira Knightley, a boombox and some memorably deployed cue cards. The movie is eagerly revisited by some devotees around this time of year, though others may find it hokey. In his review for The Times, A.O.

He made clear that he would cast a victory as a personal vindication while pre-emptively insisting that if Republicans lost, it would not be a repudiation of him.\n\nIn the days leading up to the elections, Mr. Trump emphasized that history was against him because most presidents see their party lose seats in midterm elections, in effect trying to inoculate himself against any backlash that might come with a defeat. He had a point. In the 39 midterm elections since 1862, the president\u2019s party lost House seats 35 times and seats in the Senate 24 times.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Trump was spared the worst outcome as Republicans held onto the Senate, ensuring his ability to continue confirming judges and other appointees. The Senate will most likely block any unfriendly legislation that House Democrats might advance, avoiding the need for the president to use his veto power.\n\nBut Republican setbacks in governor\u2019s races in key states could complicate Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign in two years. Democrats captured the governor\u2019s mansions in states like Kansas and Michigan that Mr. Trump won two years ago, and their control over governments in those places could make it harder for the president to repeat his feat in 2020.", "Don\u2019t go crazy with the subpoenas.\n\nIt has been a long two years for Democrats, watching Republicans fail to check Trumpian excesses.

Investigations should be strategic and methodical and clearly in the public interest \u2014 for instance, looking into corruption among cabinet officials or waste of taxpayer dollars, rather than targeting more lascivious matters, like hush-money payments to former mistresses.\n\nThe trick will be finding the right balance in both tone and topic. Many Trump-hating Democrats might be in the mood for payback, but most Americans could easily be turned off by overt political games. And, let\u2019s not forget, this is ultimately not about scoring points \u2014 Americans deserve better from their government.\n\nThe topic of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns will be especially ticklish. The president\u2019s refusal to follow his predecessors\u2019 example and release such basic information raises too many questions about conflicts of interest to ignore. But things could get ugly. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee has the right to request a copy, at which point the White House must decide if it wants to mount a legal challenge. Democrats need to be ready to make a cogent case \u2014 persuasive to the public as well as the courts \u2014 for why Mr. Trump\u2019s taxes are a matter of critical concern.\n\nFor now, Democratic representatives are making properly judicious noises about oversight. They are holding meetings among themselves to determine which issues should be priorities and how to avoid overlap among the committees. But once the new chairmen take over, the leadership will need a firm hand to minimize the wilding.\n\nGroom the party\u2019s next leaders.\n\nThe widespread assumption in Democratic circles is that Nancy Pelosi will reclaim the speaker\u2019s gavel. Practically speaking, this may be for the best, but even Ms. Pelosi has begun referring to herself as a \u201ctransitional\u201d leader.\n\nAfter 16 years as the House Democratic leader , Ms. Pelosi comes with a truckload of baggage, and a growing contingent within her own party feels it is time for a generational overhaul. But the reality is that she has no obvious successor. Her two deputies, Steny Hoyer and Jim Clyburn, offer no fresher blood. Her presumed heir, Joseph Crowley, is on his way out the door, having lost his seat in the primary election. And while plenty of hungry younger members are eyeing the post, none is seen as having the mix of experience, savvy and grit needed to steer the caucus \u2014 which will feature a large, diverse freshman class \u2014 through what promises to be a wild two years.\n\nLove her or hate her, nobody herds the cats better than Ms. Pelosi.\n\n[The Opinion section is now on Instagram. Follow us at @nytopinion.]", "When they take their seats, though, they will face a different set of expectations from our rule-breaking president, and even from their male colleagues.\n\nIn business, researchers talk about the glass cliff: the fact that women end up elevated into leadership roles in times of crisis, making success a long shot. When many of those women fail to right a ship that someone else sunk, they end up shouldering the blame.\n\nIt\u2019s an unparalleled good thing that so many women ran for office this year, and that so many women worked and volunteered on campaigns. Canvassers and journalists across the country noted the strength of female Democratic enthusiasm, and pollsters backed it up.\n\nThe narratives around who lost and why will almost certainly touch on identity, questioning whether candidates were too \u201cidentity-focused\u201d by virtue of recognizing that they were not white men, and their lives, experiences and priorities were different. This simplistic read seems destined to overshadow more nuanced takes on how sexism and racism shape our perceptions, preferences and behaviors. It also ignores a stunning reality: Women made the blue wave.\n\nIf the post-mortem will be undoubtedly tough on the women who lost, the coming years won\u2019t be much easier for the women who won. There is a perception that we need more female leaders not just because a representative democracy is a fairer democracy, but because women might just be better at the things our current leaders lack \u2014 communication, collaboration, the ability to cool one\u2019s Twitter fingers and restore a bit of integrity to politics. There is an expectation that the Democratic women elected Tuesday will make real change and do what they promised: take on President Trump, be advocates for their communities, make our national policies as representative as our country.\n\nThe problem is that they haven\u2019t really been given the tools to do it. Republicans maintain control of the Senate. They have a leader in the White House who says he will do whatever he wants.\n\nIn politics and in business, research shows that women are punished for being seen as grandstanding or self-promoting. That leaves female politicians without a crucial advocacy and negotiation tool. And more eyes will be on female legislators, because minorities in any room are inevitably more visible. The women who won on Tuesday night, then, face the monumental task of cleaning up our current mess, one made, for the most part, by men \u2014 without taking credit for their efforts.", "bad url", "If one thing became clear on Election Day, it was that Americans were eager to vote.\n\nThey turned out in huge numbers on Tuesday, capping off a tumultuous, monthslong midterm campaign marked by racial division, bitter disputes over immigration and two episodes of domestic terrorism, including one that left 11 people dead at a Pittsburgh synagogue.\n\nTurnout was significantly higher this year than in the 2014 midterm elections, when Republicans made sweeping gains in the House and Senate during President Barack Obama\u2019s final term. The number of voters was up by double-digit percentages in some counties even before all votes were counted.\n\nBut the demographic breakdown of those who voted was not clear on Tuesday night, and it was impossible to say yet whether, as voting rights advocates feared, restrictive voting laws in some states had deterred African-American and Hispanic voters.\n\nThe increases appeared to happen across the board, in both Democratic- and Republican-leaning counties. In Florida, with 98 percent of precincts reporting statewide, turnout in Duval and Pasco Counties \u2014 both Republican \u2014 was up by 38 percent and 29 percent over 2014. In Broward and Hillsborough Counties, both Democratic, turnout was up by 30 and 35 percent.", "bad url", "9 U.S.\n\n\u2018Can The President Be Impeached?\u2019 We Answer Your Questions", "You might be thinking that, in the year 2018, New York\u2019s voting should be proof against a little drizzle. No matter the precise reasons for this specific foul-up, the dysfunction in what residents like to think of as the most sophisticated city in the world was an example of the broader dysfunction of the state\u2019s electoral system.\n\nIt is run by a calcified, partisan bureaucracy that is among the worst election agencies in the country. A Democratic Legislature could impose measures to make voting easier \u2014 reducing idiotically long lines on Election Day \u2014 and modernize the election system.\n\nNew York could have early voting, as do more than three dozen other states. And allowing residents to get absentee ballots without having to provide a reason would give voters more options and also ease Election Day lines.\n\nThe Legislature should professionalize the state\u2019s election board system. Now, state law requires election boards to be made up of members selected by the two main political parties. Though the system is bipartisan, it emphasizes mere partisanship over actual qualification. It has also tended to create gridlock.\n\nThe New York City Board of Elections, for example, is made up of 10 commissioners , five chosen by the Democratic Party and five by the Republican Party, with members from each borough. The Legislature should change state election law to make the board more accountable to the city and its taxpayers, rather than party officials. That could mean remaking the board into a nonpartisan body, or requiring by state law that anyone appointed to serve as an elections official have relevant experience and qualifications apart from membership in the Democratic or Republican Party.", "With California\u2019s overall politics having turned more liberal in recent decades, much of the national spotlight before the election was on congressional seats in two historically conservative bastions that have become more Democratic: Orange County, the birthplace of Richard M. Nixon, and the Central Valley, the agricultural heart of California.\n\nThe Democratic Party targeted seven Republican-held districts across the state that Hillary Clinton won in the 2016 presidential race, hoping to flip them and help the party secure control of the House of Representatives.\n\nIn and around Orange County, four districts long held by Republicans had been seen as vulnerable, reflecting how political leanings have changed over the last decade in a region that once symbolized conservative politics. These seats include those held by Dana Rohrabacher, a conservative who has served in the House since 1989, and Mimi Walters. Democrats also mounted stiff challenges for the seats currently held by Darrell Issa and Ed Royce, Republicans who are retiring.\n\nIn another district, in northern Los Angeles County, the Republican incumbent, Steve Knight, had been locked in a competitive race against the Democratic challenger, Katie Hill, a 30-year-old who has been an advocate for the homeless.\n\nIn the Central Valley, Democrats had focused on trying to defeat the incumbent Republican, Jeff Denham, who faced Josh Harder, a venture capitalist. Mr. Denham barely eked out re-election in 2016, and significant concern about the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies \u2014 Hispanics make up 40 percent of the population in the farming region \u2014 made this year\u2019s environment favorable for Mr. Harder.\n\nBut throughout the campaign season, the central question \u2014 here, as across the nation \u2014 had been whether young people and Latinos would turn out in large numbers to vote, which would heavily favor Democrats like Mr. Harder, who made his case at a town hall last month to an audience of Latino voters.\n\n\u201cThe way we do it is by making sure people vote,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of the challenges we have date back to the fact that not everybody has their voices heard in the political process. We have to change that this year.\u201d", "\u201cI like the direction that our country is going in right now,\u201d said Julie Hickert, 53, after casting a ballot Tuesday morning in Chesterfield, a St. Louis suburb. \u201cHe is going to continue fighting the fight.\u201d\n\nFor Ms. McCaskill, 65, who swept into office amid Democrats\u2019 last wave, in 2006, and was re-elected after a stroke of luck sank her opponent\u2019s campaign in 2012, the undertow of conservative strength here proved too much this time around. Republicans made her one of their top national targets, and hammered away in personal and sometimes visceral terms.\n\nMs. McCaskill raised huge sums of money, rallied women in the state\u2019s suburbs and cities, and worked furiously to preserve enough rural support to eke out a win. But it was not enough in Missouri, where Republicans have exploited deep divisions over cultural issues like abortion and race relations to execute a rapid statewide takeover.\n\nWidely regarded as a shrewd campaigner, Ms. McCaskill turned heads in the campaign\u2019s closing days by backing Mr. Trump\u2019s polarizing approach to a caravan of asylum seekers marching toward the Southern border and releasing a radio ad that described her as \u201cnot one of those crazy Democrats.\u201d She later elaborated on Fox News.\n\nThe ad and backlash against it among liberal and black voters in St. Louis and Kansas City perfectly encapsulated Ms. McCaskill\u2019s challenge in a state that has substantial liberal, urban populations as well as rural and exurban swing voters who have moved toward the Republicans.\n\nIn the end, Ms. McCaskill suffered steep losses across the state\u2019s rural interior.\n\nThe loss likely marks the end of life in public office for Ms. McCaskill, a singular figure in Missouri politics who began her public career more than three decades ago in a male-dominated State Capitol and outlasted most of her Democratic peers. She has long coveted the state\u2019s governorship, having narrowly lost a bid in 2004, but on Tuesday night, she signaled that she had run her final race, though she said she would be unencumbered in speaking her mind.\n\n\u201cBelieve it or not, I\u2019ve really had to be kind of careful,\u201d she told supporters here. \u201cNot anymore. I will be out there fighting with you. I am not going away.\u201d\n\nThe results were equally stinging for Democrats here and in Washington. As Ms. McCaskill warned Democratic voters at events across the state in the race\u2019s final days, it may well be a long time before Democrats can compete successfully on a statewide level here again. Senate Democrats will lose an influential voice of Midwestern moderation at a time when the party is still wrestling with how best to counter Mr. Trump\u2019s electoral success in 2020. The loss of Ms. McCaskill and other moderate Democrats, like Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, is all but certain shift Senate Democrats center considerably leftward in the next two years.", "Democrats wrested control of governorships from Republicans in seven states on Tuesday including Wisconsin, where they ousted Scott Walker after eight tumultuous years as the state\u2019s chief executive, and Kansas, a surprise victory in a longtime Republican stronghold.\n\nBut Republicans fended off strong Democratic challenges to hold on to the governorships of Florida, Ohio and Iowa, maintaining their control of three states likely to be crucial in the 2020 presidential elections.\n\nThe victories expanded the number of states with Democratic chief executives \u2014 an important consideration as legislatures begin the process of drawing congressional district lines. In addition to Kansas and Wisconsin, Democrats also picked up governor\u2019s seats in Nevada, Illinois, Michigan, New Mexico and Maine.\n\nStill, the results reflected a night of mixed tidings for the party out of power, given that Democrats were hoping to install a rising young star in Florida and sweep the midwest states where President Trump forged the core of his unexpected victory two years ago.", "During his campaign for governor, Mr. Kobach, 52, presented himself as an effective policymaker who did not yield to opposition. He promised to crack down on undocumented immigrants, cut the size of state government and reduce taxes.\n\n\u201cSome people on the left may disagree with some of the things I say,\u201d Mr. Kobach told a crowd at a debate last month. But, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll deliver and I\u2019ll get it done.\u201d\n\nAt his watch party in Topeka, the mood turned somber soon after the polls closed. Mr. Kobach circulated through the crowd early in the night, pausing to pray with a group of supporters. But the crowd dwindled as Ms. Kelly ran up large margins and news agencies started to call the race for her.\n\nShortly before 11 p.m. local time, Mr. Kobach told the crowd that he had called to congratulate Ms. Kelly. \u201cIt was a tough, tough race,\u201d he said. \u201cWe battled close to the very end. But this one just wasn\u2019t God\u2019s will.\u201d\n\nMs. Kelly was relentless in trying to tie Mr. Kobach to former Gov. Sam Brownback, an unpopular Republican who left Kansas in January after presiding over big tax cuts and revenue shortfalls. Mr. Brownback, who served seven years as governor, was elected along with Mr. Kobach in 2010, and the two men have long shared a commitment to cutting taxes and enacting socially conservative policies.\n\nMr. Brownback, now a United States ambassador, promised Kansans that his signature tax cuts would provide a \u201cshot of adrenaline\u201d to the economy. But that growth failed to materialize, and the state was forced to make deep cuts to government services. Last year, a bipartisan group of lawmakers overrode Mr. Brownback\u2019s veto and reversed most of the tax policy.\n\nMr. Kobach, who tried to distance himself from that policy on the campaign trail, said Mr. Brownback\u2019s mistake was reducing taxes without first making large cuts to the size of state government.",

"Florida Democrats, who have now lost three consecutive elections for governor by about one percentage point, will be left to grapple once again with what could have been. Senator Bill Nelson, the only Democrat elected statewide, was losing late on Tuesday to Gov. Rick Scott in a race even tighter than the governor\u2019s contest. Mr. Scott poured more than $50 million of his fortune into his campaign, an eye-popping amount that helped lift Mr. DeSantis and other Republicans down the ballot.\n\nDemocrats had pinned their hopes on Mr. Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee and a talented campaigner who upended his party\u2019s orthodoxy and ran as a defiant progressive instead of the more typical centrist thought to appeal to independent voters and moderates. Mr. Gillum, who would have become Florida\u2019s first African-American governor, came close to succeeding, garnering over a million votes more than Mr. Scott did in 2014. But he ultimately could not overcome the state\u2019s inexorable demographics: Older white voters who lean conservative vote at far higher rates than do millennial and minority voters, whom Mr. Gillum needed to turn out in big numbers to assemble a winning coalition.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Florida story on election night in 2018 played out much as it did in 2016: Big, urban counties that lean Democratic reported a significant lead for Mr. Gillum. But that advantage was wiped out as results rolled in from white suburbs and exurbs in red counties, especially in the conservative Panhandle and on the southwest coast, where Mr. Trump campaigned last week and turnout was impressively high.\n\nMr. Gillum\u2019s stunning win in the August primary overshadowed Mr. DeSantis\u2019s own noteworthy accomplishment: He defeated Adam Putnam, the state agriculture commissioner, by an astonishing 20 percentage points. Mr. Putnam had seemed a lock for the Republican nomination before Mr. Trump stepped in for Mr. DeSantis, an Ivy League graduate and former Navy legal officer at Guant\u00e1namo Bay and in Iraq who gained a national audience by vigorously defending the president in frequent Fox News appearances.\n\nStill, Mr. DeSantis stumbled early on in the general election, starting the day after the primary, when he went on Fox News lauding Florida\u2019s economic success under a Republican administration and warned that electing Mr. Gillum could \u201cmonkey this up,\u201d a phrase seen by many as a racist dog whistle. Mr. DeSantis denied any racial intent in his comment.", "Pollsters were already forecasting an uphill battle for the incumbent senator, facing national political headwinds and an environment more open to unapologetic partisanship. But her political fate may have been sealed last month when she voted against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. The vote yielded her a $12 million fund-raising windfall from Democrats across the country and buoyed her get-out-the-vote effort.\n\nBut it earned her scorn from many of the Republican-leaning voters she needed.\n\n[See the results for the House of Representatives, the Senate and governors\u2019 races, and read our analysis.]\n\nThere were unforced errors from her campaign, too. Ms. Heitkamp had touted her advocacy for women and invoked her own mother\u2019s experience with sexual assault after the Supreme Court vote, taking a swipe at Mr. Cramer, who called the #MeToo movement a \u201cmovement toward victimization.\u201d But she was forced to publicly apologize after her staff released the names of survivors of sexual assault in a campaign advertisement without their permission.\n\nIn the days ahead of the election, Ms. Heitkamp was sanguine. She had been doubted before and prevailed, she said, referring to her 2012 victory in which she eked out a win by 3,000 votes. But she also acknowledged that there were voters in the state she had never been able to win over.\n\n\u201cI think people who are going to vote straight Republican, they aren\u2019t people who will ever be persuaded one way or the other,\u201d she said in an interview after a rally Monday night. \u201cThey\u2019ve joined a team.\u201d", "OTTAWA \u2014 A former cabinet minister and current member of Parliament was asked to leave the Conservative caucus on Wednesday after acknowledging he had sent sexually explicit photographs and a video to a woman over a three-week period.\n\nTony Clement, the ex-minister who twice ran for the leadership of the Conservatives, said in a statement on Tuesday night that he had believed the recipient was \u201cconsenting.\u201d But he said, without offering details, that he had \u201cbeen targeted for the purpose of financial extortion.\u201d\n\nShortly afterward, Mr. Clement resigned from several parliamentary posts, including a spot on a committee with access to national security intelligence. But on Wednesday afternoon, the leader of the Conservatives, Andrew Scheer, asked him to leave the caucus as well.\n\n\u201cI took him at his word that this was an isolated incident,\u201d Mr. Scheer told reporters. \u201cSince then, there have been numerous reports of other incidents, allegations.\u201d", "[See the results for the Senate race in Texas and other states.]\n\n\u201cI\u2019m as inspired, I\u2019m as hopeful as I\u2019ve ever been in my life, and tonight\u2019s loss does nothing to diminish the way I feel about Texas or this country,\u201d he said, later stepping off the stage as John Lennon\u2019s \u201cImagine\u201d played on the loudspeakers.\n\nRepublican strategists and insiders said Mr. Cruz\u2019s narrow victory did not mean that Democrats stood to make substantial gains in Texas. Rather, they believed it had more to do with Mr. Cruz himself, one of the most divisive political figures in the state, and the anti-Trump energy of Democrats.\n\nPivotal factors in the tightness of the election results were the Republican and independent voters who voted for Mr. O\u2019Rourke but also cast ballots for top Republicans in other races. Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican whose views are in line with Mr. Cruz\u2019s but whose style is far less abrasive, easily won re-election, and a sizable number of Republicans appeared to have split their votes for Mr. Abbott and for Mr. O\u2019Rourke.\n\n\u201cIt was political nitroglycerin from the minute this campaign started,\u201d said Ted Delisi, a Republican political consultant in Austin who was Senator John Cornyn\u2019s chief campaign strategist in 2002. \u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke couldn\u2019t have run this race against John Cornyn. He couldn\u2019t have run this race against Greg Abbott. This race had to be run against Ted Cruz, and it had to be run this year. This was the once-every-20-years opportunity.\u201d\n\nFor months on the campaign trail, Mr. Cruz was more often on the ropes than not, a surprising position for a top Republican incumbent in a state where Democrats hold no statewide offices.", "\u6bcf\u5f53\u542c\u5230\u6709\u4eba\u8bf4\uff0c\u5510\u7eb3\u5fb7\u00b7\u7279\u6717\u666e(Donald Trump)\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6beb\u65e0\u539f\u5219\u7684\u4ec7\u6068\u717d\u52a8\u8005\uff0c\u4fdd\u5b88\u6d3e\u65b0\u95fb\u8bc4\u8bba\u5458\u548c\u6b7b\u786c\u6d3e\u5171\u548c\u515a\u4eba\u90fd\u4f1a\u4e0d\u5c51\u5730\u8868\u793a\uff1a\u662f\u554a\uff0c\u662f\u554a\uff0c\u6c11\u4e3b\u515a\u6bcf\u6b21\u60f3\u6273\u5012\u54ea\u4e2a\u5171\u548c\u515a\u4eba\uff0c\u90fd\u662f\u8fd9\u4e48\u8bf4\u7684\u3002\u80fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u6765\u70b9\u65b0\u9c9c\u7684\u3002\n\n\u8981\u4e0d\u662f\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u8fd9\u662f\u4e2a\u5f88\u6070\u5f53\u7684\u56de\u5e94\uff0c\u970d\u534e\u5fb7\u00b7\u6c83\u5c14\u592b\u68ee(Howard Wolfson)\u4f1a\u88ab\u6c14\u75af\u7684\u3002\n\n\u201c\u8fd9\u8bdd\u76f8\u5f53\u6709\u9053\u7406\uff0c\u8db3\u591f\u53d1\u4eba\u6df1\u7701\u4e86\uff0c\u201d\u6c83\u5c14\u592b\u68ee\u672c\u5468\u5bf9\u6211\u8bf4\u3002\u4ed6\u66fe\u5728\u5e0c\u62c9\u91cc\u00b7\u514b\u6797\u987f(Hillary Clinton)\u76842008\u5e74\u603b\u7edf\u7ade\u9009\u4e2d\u62c5\u4efb\u8fc7\u901a\u8baf\u8054\u7edc\u4e3b\u7ba1\u3002\n\n\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ed6\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u5df1\u5728\u8fd9\u65b9\u9762\u60f3\u5f97\u5f88\u591a\uff1a\u653f\u6cbb\u5bf9\u624b\u95f4\u7684\u6076\u8a00\u6076\u8bed\u5df2\u7ecf\u53d8\u5f97\u4f55\u7b49\u6781\u7aef\uff1b\u53c2\u6218\u8005\u4f55\u5176\u81ea\u5982\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u7740\u7eaf\u7cb9\u7684\u6124\u6012\u59ff\u6001\uff1b\u800c\u5f53\u4ed6\u4eec\u9762\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a7a\u524d\u91cd\u5927\u800c\u4e25\u5cfb\u7684\u5371\u9669\u6289\u62e9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u540c\u6837\u5371\u9669\u7684\u603b\u7edf\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u65f6\uff0c\u53c8\u4f1a\u4f5c\u4f55\u53cd\u5e94\u3002\n\n\u201c\u6211\u53c2\u4e0e\u8fc72004\u5e74\u603b\u7edf\u7ade\u9009\uff0c\u201d\u4ed6\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u91cc\u6307\u7684\u662f\u7ea6\u7ff0\u00b7\u514b\u91cc(John Kerry)\u5411\u4e54\u6cbb\u00b7W\u00b7\u5e03\u4ec0(George W.

Heastie, the Bronx Democrat who serves as speaker of the Assembly. \u201cThey said that they are tired of the attacks on health care, attacks on women\u2019s reproductive rights and they are tired of tax cuts for wealthy donors.\u201d\n\nIn New York City, voters also approved three ballot questions that a commission created by Mayor Bill de Blasio said would enhance democracy: reducing maximum campaign contributions and increases public matching funds; creating a commission to civic and electoral participation; and placing an eight-year term limit on community board members.\n\nThe odds in New York are almost always against Republicans, as Democrats have more than a two-to-one advantage in voter registration. Mr. Molinaro seemingly had tried to woo some moderates by running a campaign that largely avoided social issues, though his past votes as a state assemblyman against same-sex marriage had been a potent source of attack for the Cuomo camp.\n\nMr. Molinaro, who was elected mayor of Tivoli, N.Y., at 19, had also been unable to completely shed the association with President Trump, who is very unpopular in his home state; although he did not vote for Mr. Trump in 2016, he said he could embrace some of his policies if they were helpful to New York.\n\nSpeaking to supporters in Poughkeepsie, Mr. Molinaro said he hoped that the state\u2019s government would become more inclusive, a theme of his campaign. \u201cI hope as a state we learn to do things differently,\u201d he said.", "\u201cWe have to recognize, to win in the future, that\u2019s the template, that\u2019s the blueprint,\u201d he told supporters in Mountainside. \u201cWe need to make sure people feel that if we win, we\u2019re going to represent all New Jerseyans.\u201d\n\nThe president loomed over every contest in New Jersey, though the dynamic shifted slightly in the House races.

The Republican Party is now the party of President Trump.\n\nThe dark politics of anger, division and fear were on display in campaigns across the country this year, as Republican candidates for Congress and governor \u2014 and fringe groups who support them \u2014 embraced the racially inflammatory brand of politics that Mr. Trump unleashed in 2016. With the presidential campaign of 2020 effectively underway on Wednesday, there is little reason to think Mr. Trump will back away from a tactic that clearly rallies his base.\n\n[See the results for governors\u2019 races, the House of Representatives and the Senate.]\n\nAnd as he showed his party in the closing days of the midterms, there may be no way for Republicans to escape his shadow.", "In Ms. McGrath, whose biography as a Marine aviator gave her star power and a huge fund-raising advantage, Mr. Barr found himself running against a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that he could not match. So he emphasized his conservative ideology, and prevailed.\n\n[Make sense of the country\u2019s political landscape with our newsletter.]\n\nThe district is anchored in Lexington, its most populous city by far and typically a Democratic stronghold, and the state capital of Frankfurt, another source of Democratic votes. But those cities are surrounded by mostly rural counties that are ardently conservative. In 2016, Mr. Trump won the district by 15 percentage points and Mr. Barr won by 22 points.\n\nMs. McGrath\u2019s campaign opened campaign offices in all 19 counties, and she aggressively targeted rural areas, with yard signs tailored to individual counties, some even in Republican red, and by writing op-eds that her campaign placed in weekly newspapers.\n\nThat strategy served her well in her primary campaign against Jim Gray, the popular mayor of Lexington, who was better known and had stronger financial backing. But she defeated Mr. Gray easily, and built on her strengths in rural areas during the fall campaign against Mr. Barr, pulling votes from people who were ancestral Democrats but vote for Republicans in federal office.\n\n[Follow our live briefing for the latest election updates.]\n\nMs. McGrath started out underfinanced, but her campaign money fortunes changed drastically in August 2017 when she released a two-minute video online that captured her Marine combat experience, the struggles of women and her reasons for running for office. The ad generated millions of page views and contributions, enabling her to have rough parity with Mr. Gray, and then build on an emerging national profile.\n\n\u201cThe video catapulted her to legitimacy,\u201d Mark Nickolas, Ms. McGrath\u2019s campaign manager, said.\n\nBut it was not enough to overcome the power of Mr. Barr\u2019s incumbency, a district that was structurally advantageous to Republicans and the closing moves of the president to roust his political base and make the election a referendum on him.", "Neighbors greeted one another in line. Strangers commiserated over the weather. Volunteer poll workers scoured voter rolls and processed ballots. On Sixth Avenue in Brooklyn, a state judicial candidate stood smiling on a street corner in the early-morning drizzle, introducing himself over and over to voters who he knew would probably forget his name five minutes later.\n\nAmerican democracy has had a rough go of it lately, but there was a lot to celebrate in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections. In the middle of one of the most culturally fractious and politically toxic periods in the nation\u2019s history, tens of millions of Americans of all races, classes and creeds came together as political equals, to cast ballots and decide the future course of the country.\n\nThe best part was that voters showed up \u2014 energized by outrage at the Trump presidency or by zeal for it. From Nevada to Texas, from Florida to Maine, turnout numbers blew past those of recent midterm elections, even with blustery and wet weather consuming most of the eastern United States.\n\nIn places that offered early voting, 39 million voters cast ballots before Tuesday \u2014 nearly half again as many as did so in 2014. Young people \u2014 who have been notoriously bad at showing up to the polls \u2014 turned out in record numbers.", "James noted that the signing \u201cadds depth\u201d to an area in which \u201cwe\u2019ve struggled at times.\u201d\n\nChandler is in the final season of a four-year, $52 million contract he signed with the Suns in the summer of 2015 after completing his second stint with the Mavericks. In the buyout with Phoenix, Chandler surrendered $2.1 million of his current $13.6 million because that is the same amount he will earn with the Lakers on a one-year veteran minimum deal.\n\nChandler was a high school star in the Los Angeles area before proceeding directly to the N.B.A. as the No. 2 overall pick by the Chicago Bulls in the 2001 draft. There he teamed with Eddy Curry, another prep-to-pro big man, in what was known as the Baby Bulls, an experiment that failed spectacularly.\n\nBut Chandler slowly developed into one of the top defenders in the N.B.A., sticking to a well-defined if somewhat limited role on offense.\n\nHis career peaked in a two-year period in which he won an N.B.A. title with Dallas in 2011 and then, after being traded to the Knicks, was named the N.B.A.\u2019s defensive player of the year for the 2011-12 season. That season he averaged 11.3 points, 9.9 rebounds and 1.4 blocks a game, leading the N.B.A. in field goal percentage and being named third-team All-N.B.A.\n\nHe played sparingly this season before negotiating his release from the Suns \u2014 averaging just 12.7 minutes in seven games \u2014 but remained a vocal presence in the Phoenix locker room.\n\nMcGee has emerged as an absolute steal for the Lakers, averaging 14.4 points and 7.5 rebounds through the season\u2019s first 10 games while shooting 61.4 percent from the field. But McGee\u2019s 26.2 minutes per game represent his biggest on-court responsibility since he averaged 25.2 minutes per game for Washington and Denver in 2011-12.

And he believed he had to protect his stable of news correspondents and producers to give Fox News some credibility beyond the core viewers who tuned in for its opinion hosts.\n\nSo, for instance, when Mr. Hannity went to Cincinnati to headline a planned Tea Party event in 2010, the boss forced him to cancel, angry that he had even said yes to such a thing.\n\nThese days, it seems, Fox News doesn\u2019t have anyone drawing the line. It has been that way since the departure of Mr. Ailes, who was booted from the network in 2016 after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment and who died the next year.\n\nBefore he died, Mr. Ailes went to work as an adviser to Mr. Trump. He would not be the last Fox News alumnus to make that move. The network\u2019s former co-president, Bill Shine, followed in Mr. Ailes\u2019s footsteps this year when he became the president\u2019s deputy chief of staff, overseeing communications.\n\nMr. Shine left Fox News at a time when the output from its pundits increasingly matched Mr. Trump\u2019s initiatives and outbursts. Mr. Hannity has called the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, part of a \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy run by a \u201ccrime family.\u201d Laura Ingraham has likened the federal detention facilities holding migrant children to \u201csummer camps.\u201d And Tucker Carlson has described the caravan of asylum seekers as \u201chighly dangerous.\u201d", "When his pregnant wife and two daughters disappeared this summer, Christopher Watts went on television and begged for their return. \u201cShanann, Bella, Celeste, if you\u2019re out there, just come back,\u201d he pleaded.\n\nWhen the police investigation narrowed in on him as a suspect, he tried to turn the blame on his wife, claiming it was she who strangled their daughters \u2014 and that he strangled her out of rage.\n\nNow, Mr. Watts, 33, of Frederick, Colo., has admitted that he killed his wife and two children.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Watts pleaded guilty to nine criminal counts \u2014 including murder, the unlawful termination of a pregnancy and tampering with a dead body \u2014 in exchange for an agreement that prosecutors would not pursue the death penalty, according to the Weld County district attorney\u2019s office.\n\nMr. Watts\u2019s wife, Shanann, was 15 weeks pregnant when she and their two daughters, Bella, 4, and Celeste, 3, disappeared. The case drew national attention but came to a heart-wrenching end when their bodies were found on an oil site \u2014 and Mr. Watts was arrested.", "[See the results for the House of Representatives, the Senate and governors\u2019 races, and read our analysis.]\n\nRepresentative Steve King, a Republican from Iowa who has a history of making inflammatory remarks, barred the state\u2019s largest newspaper from covering his election night event on Tuesday.\n\nCarol Hunter, the executive editor of the newspaper \u2014 The Des Moines Register \u2014 said Mr. King\u2019s son Jeff King denied a request for credentials to the event, calling the newspaper in an email a \u201cleftist propaganda media outlet with no concern for reporting the truth.\u201d\n\nMr. King narrowly defeated his Democratic opponent, J. D. Scholten, earning a ninth term in Congress, according to The Associated Press. Jeff King is a paid staff member on his father\u2019s campaign.", "\u201cMany of our neighbors are still struggling in this economy, and this could be an amazing transformational thing to have 25,000 jobs come to the community,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have to ensure we don\u2019t see another wave of mass displacement of working-class residents.\u201d\n\nSome of the HQ2 finalists promised enormous tax incentives to try to lure Amazon to their cities \u2014 a strategy criticized by many economists, who say such deals rarely pay off. It isn\u2019t yet clear what subsidies Virginia and New York offered Amazon, but there are signs the project didn\u2019t come cheap. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said Monday that the state had offered \u201ca great incentive package,\u201d and quipped that he would change his name to \u201cAmazon Cuomo if that\u2019s what it takes\u201d to land the deal.\n\nTimothy J. Bartik, an economist for the Upjohn Institute in Kalamazoo, Mich., who has studied tax incentives, said comments such as Mr. Cuomo\u2019s were concerning. He and other economists worry about a \u201crace to the bottom,\u201d where state and local governments compete to offer ever-bigger subsidies.\n\nIn one case, Wisconsin offered billions of dollars in incentives to attract a manufacturing plant from Foxconn, a Taiwan-based technology company. Since the project was announced last year, the price tag has grown, while the number of jobs has not. Mr. Bartik estimated this year that Wisconsin was paying more than eight times as much per job for the project as it did in earlier deals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to hand out cash, and it\u2019s especially easy to hand out cash if it\u2019s going to be the next governor\u2019s problem,\u201d Mr. Bartik said.\n\nBut not all incentives are created equal, he noted. Efforts to streamline regulatory and permitting processes, for example, can make projects more attractive to companies without costing taxpayers much if anything. And investments in infrastructure or job training can reap benefits for the community even if they are initially promised as a way to help a specific company.\n\n\u201cI would be trying to leverage this into improvements that wouldn\u2019t just benefit Amazon but benefit you more broadly,\u201d Mr. Bartik said.", "An Amazon spokesman said Mr. Grella was not involved in the headquarters search. The spokesman also said that the company had added more than 6,000 jobs this year in cities that applied for the headquarters but did not make the list of finalists, and that Amazon expected similar hiring in finalist cities that were not selected.\n\nOfficials from the finalist cities spent more than a year compiling thousands of pages of documents, producing slick videos and hosting Amazon officials for tours and dinners at some of their area\u2019s best restaurants. Many proposals included billions of dollars in tax incentives. New Jersey offered $7 billion in tax breaks if Amazon chose Newark. Atlanta\u2019s mayor said the city had offered more incentives to attract Amazon than it did for the Summer Olympics in 1996.\n\nIn a 218-page proposal, Boston pitched a recently closed thoroughbred racetrack as a site, as well as mass-transit extensions and an \u201cAmazon task force\u201d of city officials to act as the company\u2019s contacts at City Hall.\n\nThe Columbus Dispatch obtained more than 1,300 pages of documents prepared for the Ohio city\u2019s pitch, which detailed \u201ceverything from the size of sewer lines on sites it was pitching to detailed hate crime rates in the city.\u201d Columbus also said Amazon would not have to pay property taxes for 15 years.\n\nToronto did not offer tax incentives but told Amazon that it would save billions of dollars because of Canada\u2019s universal health care, lower cost of labor and lower overall taxes. And Denver pitched a site near its airport and more than $100 million in incentives.\n\nNew York\u2019s most recognized landmarks even turned orange for Amazon for a night.\n\nIn recent years, the AOL founder Steve Case has toured the country promoting the \u201crise of the rest,\u201d the idea that the tech boom will eventually spill out into smaller cities in the middle of the country. But in focusing on two coastal megacities, Amazon may have called that narrative into question.\n\n\u201cIt actually is deflating that maybe in this environment, there isn\u2019t a lot of opportunity for midsize cities,\u201d said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution.", "But in Arizona, the site of a weeklong teacher walkout, voters chose to reject an expansion of a voucherlike program that allows tax dollars to pay private school tuition. Teacher activists had argued that the law leeched dollars from public schools.\n\nIn a continuation of a trend from 2016, voters in two conservative states, Arkansas and Missouri, raised the minimum wage, a policy that is often popular across party lines. Missouri\u2019s wage rose to $12 from $7.85, and Arkansas\u2019 increased to $11 an hour from $8.50.\n\nAnd in California, where housing costs are the steepest in the nation, voters wrestled with two housing-related measures. O ne referendum on the statewide ballot, to overturn a state law limiting the ability of local governments to enact rent controls, was defeated. But voters in San Francisco passed a plan to raise corporate taxes in order to pay for homeless services.\n\n[Ballot initiatives have shaped nearly every facet of life in California.]\n\nThe Environment\n\nA hugely expensive and deeply divisive fight in Washington State over whether to create the nation\u2019s first carbon fee impassioned voters in a year when three of the state\u2019s 10 seats in the House of Representatives were competitive. The measure, aimed at reducing climate change, would place a fee of $15 per ton of carbon emissions, with an increase of $2 a year; most of the revenue would be invested in renewable energy and air pollution reduction. Votes were still being counted on Wednesday. A proposal to mandate more renewable energy failed in Arizona.\n\nTransgender Rights\n\nIn a vote seen as a test of a potential wedge issue ahead of the 2020 election, Massachusetts became the first state to consider a ballot measure targeting transgender rights. Voters rejected a referendum that would have repealed a 2016 law that prevents discrimination in public spaces, including bathrooms and locker rooms, based on gender identity. That law easily passed the Democratic-controlled Legislature.\n\nMarijuana\n\nMichigan became the first Midwestern state to legalize recreational marijuana, while North Dakota voters decided not to.\n\nNine states and the District of Columbia already allow adults to buy and possess marijuana in small amounts for recreational use. States have wrestled with the question of whether higher marijuana taxes would discourage use \u2014 and limit revenue \u2014 or simply preserve the illegal market, with its cheaper prices. In Michigan, taxes will be relatively low: a 10 percent excise tax and a 6 percent sales tax.", "On a dry lake in the Alvord Desert in Oregon in December 1976, Kitty O\u2019Neil wedged herself into a three-wheeled rocket-powered vehicle called the SMI Motivator. She gave the throttle two taps to awaken the engine and then watched an assistant count down from 10 with hand signals. At zero, she pushed the throttle down.\n\n\u201cDuring a sliver of a second, the howling machine stood motionless, as if stuck in time,\u201d Coles Phinizy wrote in Sports Illustrated. \u201cIn the next instant, it was gone, a shrinking blur lost in its own trailing noise.\u201d\n\nThe Motivator accelerated rapidly, though silently for Ms. O\u2019Neil; she was deaf. Her speed peaked briefly at 618 miles per hour, and with a second explosive run measured over one kilometer, she attained an average speed of 512.7 m.p.h., shattering the land-speed record for women by about 200 m.p.h.\n\nFor Ms. O\u2019Neil, her record \u2014 which still stands \u2014 was the highlight of a career in daredevilry. She also set speed records on water skis and in boats. And, working as a stuntwoman, she crashed cars and survived immolation."]
