My professor at Boston University, Dick Lehr, a longtime investigative reporter, took me under his wing to examine a 30-year-old questionable arson murder conviction. We showed up to the apartment of the man we suspected had actually started the fire in question. He was home, and appeared to be on drugs. We were invited in and, as we questioned where he was the night of the crime, we eyed a large knife on his table.

The top phones for either operating system are excellent, easy-to-use devices with virtually the same features and apps. The biggest difference is the business model.\n\nHow so?\n\nApple makes money by selling consumers expensive iPhones. Google makes money by giving away its Android software and services \u2014 and then charging advertisers for access to the billions of users it attracts.\n\nGoogle\u2019s approach has given it enormous data about the world and its inhabitants. Google is well positioned to use its mass collection of personal data for new products, like artificial intelligence, but it also draws new scrutiny to the company.\n\nApple\u2019s less data-focused approach has allowed it to take the high road on privacy. That strategy has potentially insulated the company from regulations and public scorn, but it also could leave Apple with dumber products than its rivals.\n\nInternet trolls have targeted you for your coverage.

She traveled across India giving lectures on women\u2019s rights. She studied in Britain and the United States, gave lectures in Japan and Australia, and taught Sanskrit as well as her mother tongue, Marathi.\n\nMost remarkably for her time, Ramabai charted these paths as a single woman and mother; the few Indian women who were active in social reform then did so only with the encouragement \u2014 or, at least, the permission \u2014 of their husbands.", "1.

And its state-owned companies are making inroads in the islands of Oceania \u2014 from Saipan to Vanuatu \u2014 with infrastructure projects. American officials say those could eventually become beachheads for the People\u2019s Liberation Army, which would pose a challenge to the United States Navy\u2019s operational command in the far island chains. Australia is also watching closely because the South Pacific has traditionally been its sphere of influence.\n\nCloser to home, China has continued to place military equipment and installations on rocks and reefs in the South China Sea, over which it claims sovereignty. And it is persuading some nations to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan while forcing foreign companies, including hotels and airlines, to drop any mention of Taiwan.\n\nThere is a consensus in Washington that American officials need to find ways of pushing back.\n\nIn the South China Sea, that has mainly taken the form of what are called freedom-of-navigation operations by the Navy, in which ships sail near the islands or features claimed by Beijing to establish that the waters are international \u2014 and not Chinese territory.

There were collaborations between rappers and singers, devised to bridge the culture and generation gaps (think Jody Watley and Rakim). And hip-hop aggressively borrowed soul melodies via sampling, as exemplified by Bad Boy Records. But by the turn of the century, as hip-hop officially took its place at the center of pop innovation and mainstream dominance, R&B began to feel like a footnote. Young stars like Trey Songz and Ashanti aligned themselves with hip-hop, a strategy of survival but not of confidence. Ultimately, it reduced the R&B \u2014 once the center of black social and political culture, and the conduit that brought the energy of sacred music into the secular realm \u2014 to an accent.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 2000s, singing became a full-fledged part of hip-hop, owing to the success of Drake, one of the first stars \u2014 Lauryn Hill got there earlier \u2014 who toggled cleanly between rapping and singing and understood them as variations of each other, not oppositional forces. Rappers are singers now, to the point where the framework of singing has been refracted almost wholly through the needs of hip-hop. Post Malone is a singer. Swae Lee is a singer. Young Thug is a singer. Quavo is a singer. And to varying degrees, they\u2019ve imbibed lessons from R&B. Finding someone who solely raps, in the classical sense, in the mainstream is becoming increasingly rare.\n\nNot all hip-hop singers are mining R&B traditions; Juice WRLD works in a style derived from pop-punk, as did XXXTentacion. But if R&B was a bit player a decade ago, it has at times felt like a ghost in the years since.", "LOS ANGELES \u2014 In many ways, the story of Ernie Foss runs right alongside the narrative of the state he loved, California. He was a surfer and skateboarder as a young man. He grew up in San Francisco and worked at a store in the hippie heyday of Haight-Ashbury, selling candles and crystals, a job that allowed him to pursue his passion of music. And then tech money flooded the city, his neighborhood was gentrified, and like so many others he was priced out.\n\nHe left San Francisco a decade ago and settled down in Paradise, Calif., near the woods. By then, he was sick and bedridden and often in pain, but he never stopped thinking of San Francisco. A few months ago he sent his daughter, Angela Loo, on a mission: to go back to the city and take videos of his favorite places, so he could see how they had changed.\n\n\u201cHis San Francisco roots were very important to him,\u201d Ms. Loo said. \u201cIt\u2019s where he got into music. And did his thing and where he raised his kids. It\u2019s his hometown and he loved it very much and he missed it all the time.\u201d\n\nThose videos were some of the last glimpses of the city for Mr. Foss, who died at 63 a few days ago in the wildfire that reduced Paradise to ash. His body was found outside his home, near his minivan, in what Ms. Loo believes was a desperate attempt to escape with his stepson Andrew Burt, his caretaker, as the flames engulfed the street. Mr. Foss\u2019s dog, Bernice, a little brown mutt he had rescued from a shelter, died there too.\n\nThe Camp Fire, which tore through Paradise and its surroundings last week, has become the deadliest wildfire in modern California history, with at least 56 people confirmed dead so far. Another three people were killed in the Woolsey Fire, which raced through the mountains of Southern California near Malibu.\n\nWith so many still unaccounted for and investigators scouring the ruins of Paradise and collecting DNA samples from relatives of the missing, the identities of many more victims are expected to emerge in the coming days and weeks. On Tuesday night, the Butte County sheriff, Kory Honea, said the number of missing was in the hundreds. The department has released a list with 103 names on it, which \u201cin no way is a list of everybody,\u201d said a spokesman for the department, Megan McCann.\n\nAmong those unaccounted for, although not on the list, is Mr. Burt, Ms. Loo\u2019s stepbrother.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have confirmation,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I do have confirmation of is that he was last seen trying to help, or get help, for my dad to get him into their van, and failing at it. They just didn\u2019t make it. I can\u2019t imagine that he is alive, but we have not stopped looking. We are still calling the shelters every day. We are calling the hospitals every day.\u201d\n\nImage Ernie Foss\n\nMr. Foss is among a handful of the victims whose names have been released, as authorities slowly add to the roster of the dead. Jesus Fernandez, 48, died of smoke inhalation, probably trying to rescue his dog, King. Mr. Fernandez, nicknamed Zeus, had a son who lives in Las Vegas, and was described by a friend as someone \u201cwho people counted on in rough times.\u201d\n\nAlso killed in the fire was Bill Godbout, 79, an influential figure in the early days of Silicon Valley who ran a popular electronics store. He was well-known in the hacker community, and remembered for his quirks, like his license to fly blimps. Robert Tuck, Mr. Godbout\u2019s grandson, said that Mr. Godbout had stayed behind as his wife and relatives fled, probably to save his three cats.\n\nAs his family drove away, they looked back and \u201ccould see the fire coming down on the house,\u201d Mr. Tuck said through tears. \u201cHe was listening to the radio report and thought he had a little more time.\u201d\n\nAnd while the family of 58-year-old Lolene Rios has kept her listed as missing, her stepdaughter told a reporter for The San Francisco Chronicle that they believed she had died trapped inside her home.\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s just a recovery effort,\u201d said Maria Rios, whose father Rick Rios escaped and is now recovering from severe burns on his hands and face. \u201cMy dad is in a lot of pain \u2014 he keeps saying, \u2018I have no skin, no skin.\u2019\u201d\n\nMs. Loo spoke expansively about her father \u2014 his days as a musician in San Francisco, when he was in so many blues and rock bands that she couldn\u2019t remember any of their names but one, Raine Daze. She recalled how their living room in their cottage in the Fillmore District was turned into a music studio, for recording and teaching lessons to students; how all of his recordings had been lost in the fire; and his last painful years in Paradise with lymphedema, a condition that swells the arms and legs.\n\n\u201cYou know, whenever something like this happens we tend to focus on all the positive attributes of a person,\u201d she said. \u201cGraciously ignoring all of their faults. My dad was not a perfect person. He struggled in life and was perfectly imperfect.\u201d\n\nMuch of Mr. Foss\u2019s music is lost, and so are many old photos, but there is one memento she does have: the scarf her father wore when he played music. A few years ago he said to her, \u201cI want you to take your daddy\u2019s rock \u2019n\u2019 roll scarf.\u201d She described it as \u201clike Mick Jagger\u2019s scarf.\u201d\n\nImage Jesus Fernandez\n\nEvery few months, Ms. Loo, 43, who lives in Oregon, would travel to Paradise to clean her father\u2019s house, stock up at Costco, and fill the freezer with home-cooked meals. \u201cThey lived like men, you know, my dad and my stepbrother,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Paradise, friends dropped by when they were able, and social workers and volunteers came over to keep him company, sometimes to watch his beloved 49ers or Giants with him. But over all, it was a lonely time for Mr. Foss.\n\n\u201cHe was isolated,\u201d said Ms. Loo. \u201cHe was an extrovert. He was a people person. He has been a teacher and a mentor and a friend his whole life.\u201d\n\nHe was also constantly in physical pain, something Mr. Foss wrote about in his last Facebook post, three days before he died, in which he talked about his health, and losing a wife and son in recent years.\n\n\u201cEvery day is a challenge to me physically and emotionally,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI lost my wife six years ago and my firstborn son a little more than three years ago. I am asking for prayers and positive energy.\u201d\n\nThis is one of the lasting memories Ms. Loo has of her father, one that brought her to tears as she recounted it.\n\nMr. Foss also had melanoma, and the few times he got out of the house and out of Paradise were when he would get his cancer treatments.\n\nA few years ago, after being brought home in an ambulance, a light rain \u2014 just a mist \u2014 began falling, and he asked to be left outside, on his gurney, so he could feel the rain and look at the trees.

The essay sparked a massive thread on MetaFilter, with hundreds of women speaking up about their own experience with emotional labor: the duties that are expected of you, but go unnoticed.\n\nThese invisible duties become apparent only when you don\u2019t do them. I\u2019m reminded of the time I went on an emotional labor strike. I asked my husband to manage an event we were both invited to, and when we showed up two hours late, per his mistake, all eyes were on me. \u201cWe expected you much sooner,\u201d the host said \u2014 only to me.\n\nEmotional labor has mental and physical consequences\n\nLike domestic labor, emotional labor is generally dismissed and not labeled work, but research shows it can be just as exhausting as paid work. Emotional labor can lead to insomnia and family conflict, according to a study published in Personnel Psychology. Sure, circumstantial stress, like losing a job, may lead to these same issues, but emotional labor is not circumstantial. It\u2019s an enduring responsibility based on the socialized gender role of women.\n\nLike Ms. Li, many women try to manage the added stressors to reach what Dr. Joyce said was an unattainable ideal. \u201cSome professional women aspire to do it all: reach the top of the corporate ladder and fly like supermom,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen women don\u2019t reach this ideal, they feel guilty and even more stressed. After her own bout with this, Ms. Li took a step back to regroup, then used her experience to build Sanity & Self, a self-care app and platform for overworked women. \u201cThe realizations I had in that process helped me gain insights and ultimately got me ready to incorporate self-care into my daily life,\u201d she said.\n\nThe stress problem extends beyond mental health when you consider the link between chronic stress, anxiety and heart health. Worse, most of what we know about heart disease \u2014 the leading cause of death in both men and women \u2014 comes from studies involving men, but \u201cthere are many reasons to think that it\u2019s different in women,\u201d Harvard Medical School reported.\n\nFor example, women are more likely to experience disturbed sleep, anxiety and unusual fatigue before a heart attack. Stress is so normalized, it is easy for women to shrug off those symptoms as simply the consequences of stress. Many women also do not experience chest pain before a heart attack the way men do, which leads to fewer women discovering problematic heart issues.", "If not, it might spell the end of one of the more colorful careers in Israeli politics.\n\nMr. Lieberman, 60, was born in Kishinev, now the capital of Moldova, and emigrated to Israel at 20. A onetime nightclub bouncer, he rose through the ranks to be a top leader of the right-wing Likud party and aide to Mr. Netanyahu before quitting, for the first time, in 1997 over a round of concessions to the Palestinians.\n\nHe formed Yisrael Beiteinu \u2014 \u201cIsrael is our home\u201d \u2014 as a party for Russian immigrants who favored a hard line in peace talks. He went on to hold, and then noisily quit, jobs as minister of transportation, minister of strategic affairs, deputy prime minister and foreign minister.\n\nA proto-nationalist before it came back into vogue, Mr. Lieberman appealed to his fellow \u00e9migr\u00e9s with heavily accented tough talk: toward Egypt (threatening to bomb the Aswan Dam), the Palestinian Authority (threatening to bomb its offices in the West Bank town of Ramallah), and imprisoned terrorists (to drown them in the Dead Sea). He hinted that he might want to execute Arab lawmakers as \u201cterror collaborators.\u201d\n\nOne threat haunted him: Before becoming defense minister, he boasted that if he were given the job, he would give Ismail Haniya, the Hamas leader, 48 hours to return captive Israeli civilians and the remains of two Israel soldiers, \u201cor you are dead.\u201d",

committee heads and bills rarely come to the floor without assurance of passage. We should move in the opposite direction, a smaller House. Representatives could have fractional votes depending on the population of a state.

When districts are even bigger than they are now, campaign costs will also be bigger, and we are already at a point where millions of dollars are required to win congressional seats and few candidates run who are as poor as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nJ.

For years, women have won a substantially higher share of seats in multi-winner elections than in single-winner elections.", "This account of how Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg navigated Facebook\u2019s cascading crises, much of which has not been previously reported, is based on interviews with more than 50 people. They include current and former Facebook executives and other employees, lawmakers and government officials, lobbyists and congressional staff members. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed confidentiality agreements, were not authorized to speak to reporters or feared retaliation.\n\nFacebook declined to make Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg available for comment. In a statement, a spokesman acknowledged that Facebook had been slow to address its challenges but had since made progress fixing the platform.\n\n\u201cThis has been a tough time at Facebook and our entire management team has been focused on tackling the issues we face,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhile these are hard problems we are working hard to ensure that people find our products useful and that we protect our community from bad actors.\u201d\n\nEven so, trust in the social network has sunk, while its pell-mell growth has slowed. Regulators and law enforcement officials in the United States and Europe are investigating Facebook\u2019s conduct with Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that worked with Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, opening up the company to fines and other liability. Both the Trump administration and lawmakers have begun crafting proposals for a national privacy law, setting up a yearslong struggle over the future of Facebook\u2019s data-hungry business model.\n\n[Despite a turbulent two years, here\u2019s why almost no one in tech thinks Mark Zuckerberg should step down from the company he built.]\n\n\u201cWe failed to look and try to imagine what was hiding behind corners,\u201d Elliot Schrage, former vice president for global communications, marketing and public policy at Facebook, said in an interview.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg, 34, and Ms. Sandberg, 49, remain at the company\u2019s helm, while Mr. Stamos and other high-profile executives have left after disputes over Facebook\u2019s priorities. Mr. Zuckerberg, who controls the social network with 60 percent of the voting shares and who approved many of its directors, has been asked repeatedly in the last year whether he should step down as chief executive.", "Buried beneath a half mile of snow and ice in Greenland, scientists have uncovered an impact crater large enough to swallow the District of Columbia.\n\nThe finding suggests that a giant iron asteroid smashed into what is today a glacier during the last ice age, an era known as the Pleistocene Epoch that started 2.6 million years ago. When it ended only 11,700 years ago, mega-fauna like saber-toothed cats had died out while humanity had inherited the Earth.\n\nThe discovery could lead to insights into the ice age climate, and the effects on it from the eruption of debris that would have resulted from such a cataclysmic collision.\n\n\u201cThis is the first impact crater found beneath one of our planet\u2019s ice sheets,\u201d said Kurt Kj\u00e6r, a geologist at the Center for GeoGenetics at the Natural History Museum of Denmark and lead author of the study, published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.", "Dorothy L.

They hid loudspeakers in bushes, played recorded sounds of vervets and watched the reaction. A particular bark sent the animals scurrying up trees because it was a warning about leopards; a low-pitched staccato noise had them looking skyward for predatory eagles.", "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber is still working to stem its losses ahead of going public next year.\n\nThe ride-hailing company said on Wednesday that it lost $1.07 billion in the third quarter, more than in the prior period and slightly less than in the same period a year ago, as it has invested heavily outside of its core business in areas such as bicycles, scooters and freight shipments.\n\nAt the same time, Uber\u2019s growth appears to be slowing. The company\u2019s revenue rose 38 percent in the third quarter from a year ago to $2.95 billion, down from a gain of 51 percent in the prior quarter. Gross bookings, which is what Uber earns before paying commissions to drivers and delivery people, totaled $12.7 billion, up 34 percent from the previous year.\n\nThe report card comes as Uber is preparing for an initial public offering next year, in what would likely be one of the biggest technology offerings. The I.P.O. is set to be a litmus test for other highly valued private tech companies, such as Airbnb and Lyft, which are also considering the public markets in 2019. As a private company, Uber is not obligated to publicly report its earnings, but has made a habit of doing so.", "The Italian government, a coalition between the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and right wing Lega, is trying to finance welfare programs as a solution to economic stagnation. But its spending would produce a deficit considered dangerously high for a country with so much debt.\n\nIn letters to the European Commission late Tuesday, Giovanni Tria, the Italian finance minister, promised to speed up the sale of state assets to help reduce government debt. Otherwise, he made only minor changes to a budget that the commission had rejected.\n\nThe spending is limited to what \u201cis strictly necessary to counteract the slowing of the economic cycle,\u201d Mr. Tria wrote. And he said some of the outlays were justified by emergencies, including flood damage and investment in roads and other infrastructure after a deadly bridge collapse in Genoa.\n\nThe European Commission will issue an opinion by next Wednesday, a spokesman said. What happens after that is uncertain.\n\nOfficials in Brussels will try to walk a fine line, enforcing European Union rules while avoiding a war of words with Rome that would play into the hands of populists. The commission could penalize Italy by imposing fines or withholding European Union funds for economic development. But the commission rarely moves quickly.\n\nThe big risk is that investors will lose confidence in Italy and no longer buy government bonds at interest rates the government can afford, a development that would ripple through the economy. The risk premium on Italian bonds spiked early Wednesday, though it later retreated.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund said the stimulus would be futile unless paired with measures to improve the functioning of the economy such as dismantling rules that make it costly for businesses to fire workers.\n\nWithout such changes, the I.M.F. said in a report on Monday, the spending plan could backfire.\n\n\u201cItaly could be forced into a large fiscal consolidation when the economy is weakening,\u201d I.M.F. economists wrote. \u201cThis could transform a slowdown into a recession.\u201d", "Now, when the U.S. reduces its corporate tax rate, this reduces the incentive to engage in such schemes: corporations don\u2019t have to go to Ireland to avoid taxes, they can do it right here in the U.S.A. So you would expect the tax cut to lead to repatriation of assets, and that\u2019s indeed what happened. The Bureau of Economic Analysis, which produces our balance of payments statistics, had a very helpful box on the effects of the TCJA in its latest report on international transactions that included a striking chart on the impact on multinational corporations (Figure 2). Following the tax law\u2019s enactment, U.S. firms had their subsidiaries pay the home company huge dividends; the counterpart of these dividends, on paper, was a sharp drop in investment overseas.\n\nImage Figure 2 Credit Bureau of Economic Analysis\n\nBut what did these big numbers correspond to in reality? Quite possibly nothing.\n\nImagine a U.S. company whose overseas subsidiary has $1 billion in a London bank account. Following the enactment of the tax cut, it decides to transfer that $1 billion back to the parent company - but the parent keeps the money where it is. In that case the balance of payments statistics show a big drop in net direct investment abroad, because the parent firm is reducing its apparent stake in the subsidiary. But the reality is that the company still owns that same $1 billion in London - it has just shifted from owning it indirectly via the subsidiary to holding it directly. It\u2019s just accounting, with no real-world effect.\n\nOf course, the company could choose not to keep that $1 billion in a London bank; it might do something else with it, such as buy shares back from its stockholders. But what happens to the money then? The shareholders might themselves buy assets overseas; even if they buy stock here, whoever sells them the stock might invest the proceeds abroad.\n\nIn other words, looking at corporate financial maneuvering after the tax cut doesn\u2019t really tell us anything about whether the cut is, in fact, attracting global capital into the United States. To make that assessment, we need to look at net sales of assets to foreigners by the U.S. as a whole - or, equivalently, at our net sales of goods and services, because the balance of payments always balances: the trade balance is by definition the inverse of the net capital inflow.\n\nWhat actually happened to capital inflows?\n\nIf we\u2019re trying to assess the possible effects of the TCJA on the U.S. ability to invest, we need to know how much, if at all, it promoted true inflows of capital - resources made available to the United States that let us invest more than we ourselves are saving. These inflows can be measured two different ways. One is to look directly at the international financial account: asset transactions with foreigners, where selling assets is an inflow and buying assets an outflow. The other is to look indirectly at the difference between sales and purchases of goods and services, because the trade balance broadly defined (including investment income) - aka the balance on current account - is the flip side of capital inflows.\n\nIn principle these two methods should give the same result. In practice there is sometimes a significant \u201cstatistical discrepancy,\u201d probably because some financial transactions don\u2019t end up being properly reported. This is less of an issue for goods and services, although some of the same strategies used for tax avoidance can distort this balance too. Anyway, I\u2019ve prepared a little chart showing quarterly measures of capital inflow since 2016, by both methods (Figure 3.)", "[What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\n\nIn the days before Amazon\u2019s official announcement that it would situate its second headquarters in two locations, one of them in Queens, many New Yorkers were outraged by the impending incursion as they surely went about ordering their slow-cookers and folding chairs and heavily discounted copies of \u201cFriday Black\u201d from the company, for expedited delivery. The holidays, after all, are approaching.\n\nI count myself among the hypocrites. Along with so many others who think about urbanism, I spent much of Monday ruminating on the paradox of a company with a trillion-dollar valuation receiving billions of dollars in tax credits for bringing high-paying, technocratic jobs to a place already full of them. During the last decade, the city has added 76,000 tech jobs. In September, New York State recorded its lowest unemployment rate in 30 years.\n\nAnd yet Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo went after Amazon as if he were the desperate patriarch in a 19th-century novel, ready to balloon the family dowry without limit all for the prospect of ensuring that his daughter marry up, even if, in truth, she stood at the pinnacle and could have anyone. Was it really necessary that Amazon get its own helipad when there is one right across the river?

A case I handled long ago captures this. A group of women who worked for a dry cleaner came to our office because they were underpaid, working 56 hours a week for subminimum wages and no overtime.\n\nAs I investigated, I quickly learned how interrelated their problems were. The women, who were Latina, were paid less than their male co-workers. All of the Latino workers, male and female, made less than their non-Latino counterparts. No one made enough to live on, and everyone there was surely exposed to highly toxic chemicals. Over repeated meetings, another story also emerged: The boss routinely made leering comments to the women workers, told them to wear short skirts and, as I later learned, had sex with one of them in a La Guardia Airport hotel \u2014 consensually, he insisted. When I questioned him in sworn testimony about his behavior toward his female employees, he said, \u201cSpanish women like it.\u201d\n\nHow do you tease apart the sexism, racism and economic exploitation in this situation? You can\u2019t. They\u2019re inseparable. What brought the women to our office was their unlawfully low pay. But this was partly a result of discrimination against them based on their sex and national origin, and from an even broader viewpoint, it was a result of their lack of power or a voice on the job.\n\nSo why would it make sense to end forced arbitration in cases of sexual harassment only? Why should any company still block people from filing in court when they\u2019re racially harassed or underpaid or paid less because of their national origin? All are offenses against human dignity, and in all of these cases, there is the same tremendous power differential that makes it so hard for people to speak up.\n\nThe workers who walked out at Google have lives very distinct from the immigrant women who spend their days pressing clothes. But at the root of sexual harassment, or any kind of workplace abuse, is abuse of power.

This year\u2019s finalists were a bit more thematically diverse. In addition to Stewart\u2019s biography of Alain Locke, there was also a biography of the botanist David Hosack (Victoria Johnson\u2019s \u201cAmerican Eden: David Hosack, Botany, and Medicine in the Garden of the Early Republic\u201d) and Adam Winkler\u2019s \u201cWe the Corporations: How American Businesses Won Their Civil Rights,\u201d a history of how corporations gained power and influence in the United States, shaping national policies to grant companies rights that are comparable to those of individuals.\n\nSome of the nominated books speak to our current politics and the growing cultural, political and class divide between rural and urban America, most notably Sarah Smarsh\u2019s \u201cHeartland: A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke in the Richest Country on Earth,\u201d which chronicles her childhood in Kansas, where she grew up in a white working-class family, and addresses how poverty can trap people across generations.\n\nJustin Phillip Reed\u2019s \u2018Indecency\u2019", "Here is what was on view on Election Day in Jonathan Adler\u2019s company headquarters on Hudson Street in Manhattan: a bit of Brutalism; lots of organic modernism (of the sort once seen in 1960s-era Reform synagogues); a dash of Egyptian revival (but the \u201970s version); scenes from the Memphis movement; references to pre-Columbian pottery, and to early \u201980s disco tropes and Pop Art; many, many objects emblazoned with marijuana leaves (including a stunning beaded and embroidered textile that read \u201cWeed\u201d in a medley of greens); and an elderly and very grumpy Chihuahua atop a lavender towel on a shredded lime-colored chair.\n\nTrained in semiotics and art history at Brown, Mr. Adler has long been known for his exuberant style that is also a big tent of references. It was nearly 30 years ago that the designer, now 52, made a line of quilted pottery inspired by Chanel bags, and 20 years ago that he opened his first home store on Broome Street.\n\nHis company now has 17 stores worldwide, a wholesale and e-commerce business, and a residential and commercial design practice.\n\nLast month, Mr. Adler introduced a collection for Amazon called Now House: whimsical objects and furniture in mod black and white and postmodern pastels.

I believed I had demanded it!\n\nI\u2019ve covered comic books here at The Times since 2002, but I started reading them regularly in 1981. Though I had already encountered many superheroes in animated form, my discovery of comic books took my love to a new level. And in those pages, Stan Lee\u2019s name was inescapable. If you wanted to start at the beginning, as many readers did, perusing the early issues of the Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Spider-Man and the X-Men invariably lead you to him \u2014 as well as to the names of the extraordinary artists who created those characters with him. Later on in my reading life, I would catch his credit, \u201cStan Lee presents,\u201d on the title page of stories by other writers. It always felt like a seal of approval.\n\nHis personality always popped, especially in the back pages, which were typically devoted to letters from fans and included his editorials, titled \u201cStan\u2019s Soapbox.\u201d (They were reprinted in 2008 and some of them turned up on Twitter on Monday as he was mourned and remembered.)

His words made us feel as if we belonged somewhere.", "WASHINGTON \u2014 He has been accused of rigging the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries to thwart Bernie Sanders and facilitating a deluge of big money into politics. He helped arrange financing for the dossier of sometimes salacious and unverified claims about President Trump\u2019s ties to Russia and now is under direct fire from the president, who has said he is trying to steal the Senate race in Florida from the Republican candidate, Gov. Rick Scott.\n\nFor an election lawyer, Marc E. Elias has drawn unusually intense attention and criticism.\n\nBut then, Mr. Elias, who is representing Senator Bill Nelson, the Democratic incumbent, in the Florida recount, has been at the center of an unusually large number of high-stakes political fights.\n\nHis role in the Florida battle, in which Mr. Scott\u2019s lead has shrunk from nearly 60,000 votes at the end of election night to less than 13,000 votes out of more than eight million cast, has thrust him even further onto center stage as the Democrats\u2019 lead lawyer and spokesman, making him a tempting foil for Mr. Trump.\n\nLast week, Mr. Trump called him out by name, referring to \u201cthis guy Elias, who represented Hillary Clinton and a lot of very shady things.\u201d That was an apparent reference to Mr. Elias\u2019s secretly arranging funding from two of his clients \u2014 Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee \u2014 to compile research that became the dossier about Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia.", "In Texas, which prided itself on larger-than-life stories, the eccentricities of the Hunt family \u2014 the oilman H. L. Hunt fathered 15 children with three women over 35 years \u2014 had been a high-stakes soap opera for decades. The patriarch, a storied wildcatter and perhaps the world\u2019s richest man when he died in 1974, had left the bulk of his fortune in separate trusts to his children by his first wife: Caroline, Bunker, Herbert, Lamar, Margaret and Haroldson, who had been mentally ill since 1942. (A seventh sibling died in infancy.)\n\nImage In 2000 Ms. Hunt published a novel, \u201cPrimrose Past: The 1848 Journal of Young Lady Primrose.\u201d She also wrote two cookbooks.\n\nWhile her brothers caught the public eye with financial high-wire acts in silver, oil and sugar, Caroline Hunt led a relatively normal life. She attended college, married a World War II pilot, raised five children, wrote two cookbooks and a novel, and became a philanthropist and a Presbyterian Church deacon. She and her financial advisers made investment decisions, but she left day-to-day operations to executives whose decision-making was based on Christian principles.\n\n\u201cIf she has had any influence on the management of her enormous wealth,\u201d The New York Times reported in 1986, \u201cit has been to instill a certain ethos among the people in charge \u2014 an insistence on integrity and propriety that has been markedly absent from her brothers\u2019 affairs.\u201d\n\nThe big gamble by Bunker and Herbert was trying to corner silver, much of it bought on margin or with borrowed money. When the bubble burst in 1980, their holdings plunged in two months to a $1.7 billion debt from a $7 billion value.\n\nYears later they emerged from bankruptcy as millionaires, though no longer fabulously wealthy.\n\nBunker attended horse races and died in 2014. Lamar, only slightly involved in the silver deals, founded the American Football League and owned the Kansas City Chiefs. He died in 2006. Herbert continued in real estate.", "LONDON \u2014 Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain faced down hard-line critics Wednesday and won the support of a jittery and divided cabinet for a plan to quit the European Union, preserving her push to avert an economically damaging rupture with the bloc in March.\n\nFor Mrs. May, frequently criticized as wooden and lacking in strategic thinking, the victory represented a rare validation of her leadership. It also provided a glimmer of light at the end of the Brexit tunnel.\n\n\u201cThe choices before us were difficult,\u201d Mrs. May said in a brief statement in front of her offices at 10 Downing Street. \u201cBut the collective decision of the cabinet was that the government should agree to the draft withdrawal agreement and the outline political declaration.\u201d\n\nDespite fears that cabinet ministers might resign in protest, possibly threatening her government, none did so immediately. Nevertheless, Mrs. May acknowledged publicly that around five hours of talks had produced \u201cimpassioned\u201d debate. That description seemed to corroborate media reports that as many as 10 cabinet ministers had expressed reservations before the plan was agreed upon without a vote.", "Supporters had expressed hope that the agreement would salvage and transform New York City\u2019s public housing, providing additional oversight and an infusion of cash to overhaul the decrepit living conditions in many of Nycha\u2019s 176,000 apartments.\n\nThe judge\u2019s ruling dealt a political blow to Mr. de Blasio, who had inserted the city into the negotiations between the United States attorney and the Housing Authority and had declared that the settlement was a \u201cpivotal moment for the future of public housing in New York City.\u201d\n\nIt came just hours after Mr. de Blasio appeared on television to defend his decision to offer financial incentives to Amazon as part of a deal to bring the company to Long Island City, Queens, a short walk from the nation\u2019s largest public housing complex. The contrast seemed to underscore the income inequality that persists in the city despite the mayor\u2019s campaign vows to change it.\n\nEric F.

He said Congress had \u201cexpressly entrusted\u201d the primary responsibility for saving failing public housing systems to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. The proposed settlement shifted that job to the court, he said, and in doing so may violate the separation-of-powers principle in the United States Constitution.\n\nJudge Pauley also said the settlement did not have strong enough enforcement mechanisms, calling them \u201cformless.\u201d The performance requirements for Nycha, he noted, would be developed in the future by the monitor and \u201care not subject to the court\u2019s approval.\u201d\n\nThe ruling followed a remarkable hearing in September, at which more than 50 tenants packed Judge Pauley\u2019s courtroom and gave tearful testimony about living conditions in public housing.", "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously Wednesday to lift sanctions against Eritrea following its thaw in relations with Ethiopia and other neighboring countries, but kept an arms embargo on Somalia and a ban on trade in charcoal, a key source of money for Shabab militants.\n\nThe resolution approved by the council, the United Nations\u2019 most powerful body, commended \u201cefforts toward peace, stability and reconciliation in the region\u201d led by Ethiopia\u2019s reformist prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, who came to power in April and accepted an international commission\u2019s border decision favoring Eritrea.\n\nEthiopia is a regional power and actions by the country\u2019s leader set off several diplomatic thaws, including one between Eritrea and Somalia.

In the 1920s and \u201930s, the journal noted how localities with weaker gun laws, as well as the country as a whole, experienced more gun violence than their peers.\n\nIn our own time, the N.R.A. has not only stymied federal research into gun violence but has also blacklisted medical groups for being \u201canti-gun,\u201d opposed the nomination of Vivek Murthy as surgeon general, and backed a Florida law that prevented doctors from engaging patients about gun ownership .", "In 2011, HBO began a series based on a set of books whose legion of fans had exacting expectations. \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d required condensing a vast narrative, visualizing wonders like dragons\u2019 flight and creating a world that spanned continents.\n\nHBO\u2019s new series \u201cMy Brilliant Friend,\u201d based on the wildly popular Neapolitan novels of Elena Ferrante, is a different but no smaller challenge.

Its drama, though punctuated by violence, is interior and inwardly focused. It enfolds warring families and shifting alliances, but in a setting where everyone is packed close and prying eyes and whispers are inescapable.\n\nIt is a game of courtyards, stairwells and balconies.

The history of this sleeping colossus includes two massive eruptions, 39,000 and 15,000 years ago, that left deep calderas in the landscape. Its last significant volcanic event was a 1538 eruption known as Monte Nuovo that spawned a small n ew mountain. Since then, it has been curiously eruption-free.\n\nToday, 1.5 million people live within the volcano \u2019s caldera and its surroundings, and the cache of magma that could burst from the area\u2019s hellish underbelly makes it one of the most hazardous areas on Earth. In a study published Wednesday in Science Advances, volcanologists report that Campi Flegrei is at the start of an eruption cycle, one that may result in a massive outburst at some point in the likely distant future.\n\nThe researchers arrived at this conclusion by unspooling the 60,000-year-long history of the volcano, which revealed what appears to be a rhythm to Campi Flegrei\u2019s upsurges. Fortunately, there are no signs that an eruption is imminent. And because the volcano is one of the world\u2019s most closely monitored, scientists are likely to pick up on any warning signs.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nPrevious studies of Campi Flegrei have focused on one or a handful of its eruptions. But the new study, led by Francesca Forni, a postdoctoral researcher at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, who conducted the work at ETH Zurich, used fresh geological samples taken from 23 eruptions across its history, both larger and smaller , to see how the chemistry of the magma changed over deep time. Her team also used computer models to simulate what may have occurred inside the volcano since the last caldera-forming eruption 15,000 years ago.", "PARKER\n\nSelected Stories\n\nBy Dorothy Parker\n\nRead by Elaine Stritch.\n\n2 hours, 57 minutes.

Two iconic New York broads known as much for their personas, at this point, as for their work. The recording was made in 1995, but never existed in digital form until now; rather, it was a sort of urban legend, the kind of thing a friend of a friend might have heard on cassette once and then raved about forever.

His credentials were revoked last week after a testy exchange with President Trump.\n\nMuch of the debate revolved around whether the White House had retaliated against Mr. Acosta for his critical coverage, which CNN said amounted to a violation of his First Amendment and due process rights. Lawyers for the Justice Department argued that Mr. Trump had discretion to choose the reporters who cover his events at the White House.\n\nThe judge, Timothy J.

As a result, much of the vegetation that might otherwise have been cleaned by naturally occurring blazes piled up, making subsequent fires that much more deadly. And now it\u2019s a business: About 40 percent of America\u2019s wildfire-fighting resources (helicopters that can cost as much as $7,000 an hour, for instance) are provided by private companies.

Taylor\n\n448 pp. Harcourt. (2000)\n\nThis memoir by a smokejumper, the aerial firefighters deployed to fight remote forest fires, is \u201cnot surprisingly, filled with adventure, danger and tragedy,\u201d according to our reviewer. The book takes place over the 1991 jumping season, and recounts the litany of injuries Taylor sustained, as well as details about his job, including run-ins with bears or the digging of fire lines. Occasionally, details of the writer\u2019s life (like his divorce) also seep through.\n\nImage\n\nHEROES OF THE FRONTIER\n\nBy Dave Eggers\n\n385 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. (2016)\n\nWhen Josie\u2019s ex asks to take their children to meet his new fianc\u00e9e\u2019s family, Josie decides to take the children and run, heading to Alaska. (It\u2019s as far as she can get without a passport.) The family heads north in a rented RV and, as our reviewer, Barbara Kingsolver, wrote, \u201cThe landscape feels increasingly abandoned as Alaskans flee wave after wave of wildfires sweeping through the tinder-dry forests.\u201d The stars of the book, Kingsolver said, are the children, who command us to pay attention to the objects we find in our path, and stop pretending we already know the drill.\u201d", "A crucial feature of the Senate plan, called the First Step Act, is the inclusion of so-called front-end reforms with the goal of a more rational sentencing process. The House version, passed in May, focused solely on \u201cback end\u201d reforms, such as improving prison conditions and easing inmates\u2019 re-entry into society. But tending to the existing prison population without tempering the draconian sentencing laws that caused that population to explode in recent decades is, as Charles Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has put it, \u201cna\u00efve and unproductive.\u201d That\u2019s why reform advocates saw the House bill as worse than nothing, a cheap attempt by Congress to move past the issue without addressing one of its core problems.\n\nThe Senate bill aims to be more comprehensive. It would reduce mandatory sentencing guidelines for certain drug crimes, allow judges greater wiggle room in sentencing nonviolent drug offenders, do away with the \u201cstacking\u201d provision that tacks on years for the use of a firearm during the commission of a crime and, at long last, make retroactive the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduced the sentencing gap between crack and powder-cocaine offenses.\n\nDetails of the bill began making the rounds early this week, and the initial reviews among advocates were solid, if not entirely glowing. Most notably, some reformers expressed disappointment that the bulk of sentencing changes would not apply retroactively, leaving thousands of inmates serving excessive terms under the old guidelines. But even the skeptical agreed that the plan was a major step forward.\n\nThe Brennan Center for Justice, a prominent voice in the reform movement and one that vigorously opposed the House\u2019s bill, quickly came out in support of this version. \u201cThe original First Step Act would have little effect on reducing prison populations and was a concession to Jeff Sessions \u2014 one of the only people against sentencing reform,\u201d said Inimai Chettiar , head of the center\u2019s Justice Program. \u201cWe support this week\u2019s Senate compromise bill because it includes several key sentencing reform provisions\u201d carried over from the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act.\n\nFurther fueling optimism about the legislation\u2019s future, last week the Fraternal Order of Police issued a statement in support of the bill, specifically endorsing its sentencing reforms. This is a significant shift from February, when the group sent Mr. Trump a letter opposing previous sentencing reform efforts. The bill has also been endorsed by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration, the National District Attorneys Association and the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives. Other groups have withdrawn previous objections.", "Filled with scenes of sexual violence and body horror, Bertrand Mandico\u2019s \u201cThe Wild Boys\u201d might have been unbearable were it not so fantastical and stylized. Set in the early 20th century, it follows five literate juvenile delinquents (all boys, but played by women), who rape and kill their English teacher and are sent to sea as punishment. There, a hard-driving Dutch sea captain tortures them with work and tantalizes them with his manliness, at one point even displaying his tattooed penis. Things get really delirious when he brings the boys to an island rich with twisted, mysterious sights: Tree branches shoot milky white fluids; furry flora shaped like women\u2019s legs opens up to receive them.\n\nThe whole movie luxuriates in a kind of erotically charged but hyper-classical artificiality, with fake sets, arch dialogue, frequent rear-projections and copious shots of (clearly prosthetic) genitalia. Filmed in shimmering black and white, with dashes of surreal color, it\u2019s as if Guy Maddin and Kenneth Anger adapted one of Joseph Conrad\u2019s nightmares for a sexploitation producer.", "After multiple investigations into the ambush in Niger that left four American soldiers dead last year, the United States Army punished several people who were involved in the mission, including the two soldiers who led the 11-man team when militants attacked it. Those punished were not reprimanded for what happened during the ambush but rather what led up to it, including poor training alongside Nigerien troops, a lack of pre-mission rehearsals and what investigators called a misleading mission plan. The leader of the Special Forces team, Capt. Mike Perozeni, along with his second in command, received a General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand, known as a GOMOR. A reprimand\u2019s impact is based on where it is placed in a soldier\u2019s file. If the letter is considered \u201clocal,\u201d it will disappear after the soldier changes jobs. If it is permanent, it likely means the end of a career. The soldier, and others on his behalf, can write a rebuttal. Below is a letter written on behalf of Captain Perozeni by Henry Black, the father of Staff Sgt. Bryan Black, one of the four soldiers killed in the ambush. A version of this letter was delivered to Maj. Gen. Edwin J. Deedrick Jr., the commanding officer of the First Special Forces Command, who administered the letters. With Black\u2019s permission, it has been lightly edited for clarity and to protect the identity of some of the soldiers, whose names have not been released. Thomas Gibbons-Neff\n\nI am submitting this letter to urge that the General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand (GOMOR) on Capt. Michael Perozeni not be filed.\n\nI am a retired Marine, a combat veteran and Staff Sgt. Bryan Black\u2019s father. As I am sure is the case with you, I am all too familiar with loss. I lost two friends in the Iraq war, and I lost my youngest son on Oct. 4, 2017. And I am now looking at the prospect of the Army losing a valuable asset, Captain Perozeni, which I believe will be the result if the GOMOR is filed. That both saddens and angers me.", "Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.\n\n__________\n\nAmerican corporations want to kick their reliance on big pharmaceutical companies.\n\nWalmart and Home Depot are among the many companies that are fighting back against drugmaker programs that cut patients\u2019 expenses while leaving employers paying full rates. It is part of an escalating war between providers, insurers and corporations over health care costs. The effectiveness remains to be proved.\n\nAmerica spends about 18 percent of its gross domestic product, or roughly twice as much as most developed nations, on health care. A large part of that pays for the administrative staff that battle to take dollars from other players and patients, or defend their own pockets. The United States had the highest percentage of health expenditure on insurance and administration, and patient time spent on cost disputes, among 11 industrialized countries, according to a 2014 study by The Commonwealth Fund.\n\nPharmaceuticals, which account for some 10 percent of the U.S. health budget, are a good example of this struggle. To limit what they consider unnecessary drug spending, most insurers require that patients pay a portion of the cost, known as the co-pay, subject to an annual limit. As co-pays have escalated, drugmakers have introduced assistance cards that limit patients\u2019 out-of-pocket costs while leaving insurers and employers stuck with the bill.", "The idea that counting calories is the key to weight loss has long been embedded in the government\u2019s dietary guidelines. It is the driving force behind public health policies like mandatory calorie counts on restaurant menus and food labels. Many experts say that the underlying cause of the obesity epidemic is that Americans eat too many calories of all kinds, prompted by easy access to cheap and highly palatable foods, and that they need to exercise portion control. On its website, for example, the National Institutes of Health encourages people to count calories and warns that dietary fat has more calories per gram than protein or carbs: \u201cYou need to limit fats to avoid extra calories,\u201d it states.\n\nBut experts like Dr. Ludwig argue that the obesity epidemic is driven by refined carbohydrates such as sugar, juices, bagels, white bread, pasta and heavily processed cereals. These foods tend to spike blood sugar and insulin, a hormone that promotes fat storage, and they can increase appetite. Dr. Ludwig and his colleague Dr. Cara Ebbeling have published studies suggesting that diets with different ratios of carbs and fat but identical amounts of calories have very different effects on hormones, hunger and metabolism. He has also written a best-selling book on lower-carb diets.\n\nDr. Hall and others disagree. They have published studies disputing the notion that carb-restricted diets accelerate metabolism and fat loss. Dr. Hall said that low-carb diets have many benefits: They can help people with Type 2 diabetes manage their blood sugar levels, for example. But he argues that the carb and insulin explanation for obesity is too simplistic and has been \u201cexperimentally falsified\u201d in rigorous studies.\n\nDr. Hall published a meta-analysis of feeding studies last year that suggested that energy expenditure was actually slightly greater on low-fat diets. But Dr. Ludwig pointed out that those studies were very short, with none lasting longer than a month and most lasting a week or less. He said the process of adapting to a low-carb diet can take a month or longer.\n\n\u201cA few days, or a couple weeks, is not enough time to make any meaningful conclusion about how diets affect metabolism over the long term,\u201d he added.", "\u201cThere is a different sensibility with regard to these issues, so we wanted to respond,\u201d said Ellen Sorrin, the Trust\u2019s director. \u201cWe are not demanding that companies do this; we\u2019re making them aware that these are concerns.\u201d\n\nThese adjustments are part of a broader effort to re-examine how people of color are portrayed in the performing arts and how classics with potentially troubling aspects can be made acceptable to modern audiences. In 2015, the Metropolitan Opera eliminated blackface from its \u201cOtello.\u201d The Bolshoi has toned down a segment of its \u201cLa Bayad\u00e8re\u201d featuring white children in blackface, but it has been criticized for not going far enough. And more recent fare has also been revised: The musical \u201cCats\u201d dropped a song in which characters sang in Asian accents.\n\n\u201cI see what\u2019s happening at the Balanchine Trust as part of a larger movement in the arts to address entrenched cultural narratives that undermine tolerance, fairness and inclusion,\u201d said Lane Harwell, a program officer at the Ford Foundation, who previously served as the founding executive director of Dance/NYC, a service organization. \u201cAny resistance is just because change is hard, but performing arts are not a static form, and continual interrogation and reinterpretation keeps historical work relevant.\u201d\n\nThere has been some pushback from purists who argue against altering a work of art in response to changing times \u2014 and there is particular sensitivity surrounding Balanchine, whose \u201cNutcracker\u201d is a widely cherished tradition. But, for the most part, ballet companies around the world seem to be on board.", "More than 300 researchers and graduate students are working or studying at CyLab this year, making it among the largest cybersecurity training centers in the world. It offers more than 50 courses in security and privacy and has trained more than 75,000 people.\n\nBiometrics, the science of using hard-to-mask physical attributes \u2014 like facial characteristics, fingerprints, retinal scans and DNA \u2014 is just one specialty. CyLab is also engaged in broader uses for A.I., cryptography, network security and an array of other cybersecurity skills.\n\nOne of the first times Professor Savvides and his group used his facial-recognition technology for something besides research was just after the 2015 Boston Marathon bombing. His lab took the blurry, low-resolution, surveillance image of the suspected bomber released by the F.B.I. and, using A.I. technology, reconstructed the image and sent it to the bureau.\n\nThe next morning, the identity of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was convicted of the bombing, was revealed. Professor Savvides doesn\u2019t know whether his reconstruction helped the F.B.I., but \u201cwe were extremely surprised to see the resemblance to Tsarnaev that was constructed from the very low resolution, pixelated face that even our human brain cannot comprehend,\u201d he said.\n\nProfessor Savvides was also happy to demonstrate another gee-whiz technology \u2014 long-distance iris scanning. Rather than requiring that an eye be placed directly up to a scanner, the device he helped invent looks like a very large camera lens with a smaller one on top and wings of infrared lights on either side. It can identify people by their irises from as far as 40 feet away.\n\nLike fingerprints, each person\u2019s iris is unique; it stays the same as we age, and unlike fingerprints, cannot be scratched or covered up in some way short of removing the eye altogether", "Image\n\nCardiologists are generally convinced that blood pressure inevitably increases with age. Now a new study calls this belief into question.\n\nResearchers studied two communities in a remote area of the Venezuelan rain forest that can only be reached by air. The Yanomami are among the most isolated and least assimilated people in the world. Nearby live the Yekwana people, also quite isolated, but with an airstrip that allows for the regular delivery of Western food and medicine.\n\nThe study, in JAMA cardiology, included 72 Yanomami and 83 Yekwana men, women and children ages 1 to 60. While the two groups were similar in other respects, average blood pressure among the Yanomami was 95/63, whereas in the Yekwana it was 104/66.\n\nBy the time they reached age 60, blood pressure among the Yanomami was unchanged, while the Yekwana average had risen to 114/73.", "I was late for breakfast with Colorado\u2019s governor, John Hickenlooper. We were in Manhattan, on the same September day that President Trump gave a speech at the United Nations, the one where the delegates laughed out loud at him. By the time I reached Madison Avenue, I found the street entirely blocked off by police barriers.\n\n\u201cHow do I get from here to there?\u201d I asked a cop. I thought it was a reasonable question.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d he replied, summing up the Trump era in a single phrase.\n\nSo I stood there, along with a score of other New Yorkers, waiting for Mr. Trump to pass. At last his motorcade appeared, and as it did, people on both sides of the street spontaneously raised their arms and flipped our chief executive the bird.\n\nAs the barricades fell and I rushed to meet Mr. Hickenlooper, I wondered if the governor \u2014 on the cusp of a possible run for president \u2014 could also inspire such passions.", "Last month, the Environmental Protection Agency effectively disbanded a scientific panel of experts on microscopic airborne pollutants that helped the agency figure out what level of pollutants are safe to breathe. The agency also dropped plans for a similar panel of experts to help assess another dangerous pollutant, ground-level ozone.\n\nThese decisions were the latest assaults on science at an agency that depends on science to protect Americans\u2019 health, safety and quality of life.\n\nThe disbanded panel on particulate pollution reported to the E.P.A.\u2019s seven-member Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, which is responsible for advising the agency on overall air quality standards. Now, without the work of that panel, it is entirely likely that the advisory committee will lack the time and expertise to provide authoritative guidance on the regulation of this pollutant. The same can be said of ground-level ozone.\n\nAnd that is no small matter. The E.P.A. itself says that numerous studies show that particulate pollution can lead to premature death in people with heart or lung disease, nonfatal heart attacks, irregular heartbeats, aggravated asthma and decreased lung function. Ground-level ozone can affect the breathing of people with asthma, children, older adults, and people who are active outdoors.", "It would also extend retroactively a reduction in the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine signed into law in 2010, which could affect thousands of drug offenders serving lengthy sentences for crack-cocaine offenses, which were dealt with far more harshly than the same crimes involving powder cocaine. That disparity hit black Americans hard while letting many white drug dealers off with lighter punishments.\n\nThe other half of the proposed bill creates a package of incentives and new programs aimed at improving prison conditions and preparing prisoners for re-entry into their communities. It would require the Justice Department to create a risk and need assessment system to nudge prisoners toward better outcomes. And it would expand time credits that reward good behavior and create new ones for participating in job-training and other programs that allow offenders to reduce their time behind bars.\n\nThe legislation would also improve conditions for incarcerated women, prohibiting the shackling of female inmates while pregnant, and would require the Bureau of Prisons to locate prisoners in facilities close to their homes, if possible.\n\nThe Fraternal Order of Police, the country\u2019s largest police organization, said last Friday that it would support the bill, and the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association appeared to have dropped some previous objections after exceptions were made to block certain fentanyl offenders from eligibility for \u201cgood-time credits\u201d included in the prison overhaul portion of the bill.\n\nBut powerful pockets of opposition remain among some law enforcement officials and conservative lawmakers \u2014 like Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas \u2014 who argue that sentencing changes like those proposed pose a risk to public safety. However, they lost a powerful ally within the administration when Mr. Trump fired his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, last week. Mr. Sessions\u2019s temporary replacement, Matthew G. Whitaker, has signaled that he is more open to the changes.\n\nMr. Trump himself is leery of appearing weak on crime, and he has been susceptible to arguments from opponents of a sentencing overhaul that endorsing one could arm his critics. Still, Mr. Kushner has pressed the issue for months, and some of the president\u2019s advisers say they think the effort could help improve his anemic standing with African-American voters, even if only marginally.\n\nIn his remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Trump tried to address both points, saying that the legislation would be tougher on hardened criminals. But in a reference to the tough-on-crime policies embraced by President Bill Clinton, Mr. Trump also said that the legislation would begin to roll back portions of the \u201cClinton crime bill\u201d that had a \u201cvery disproportionate and very unfair\u201d effect on black Americans.", "With that, and a photograph snapped of Mr. Jones, 26, as he cashed his paycheck, his lawyers argued that it was impossible for him to have committed the crime. Both brothers have been released on bond for now, an unusual step in a federal murder case, while prosecutors say they are continuing to investigate.\n\nMr. Jones\u2019s turn of fortune might not have been possible before the modern era, where the plastic MetroCards, along with E-ZPass and surveillance cameras, have become ubiquitous.\n\nCritics have said that the devices, for all their convenience, have ushered in an era of Big Brother, but they have nonetheless become useful in legal proceedings, whether to prove or undermine an alibi, find a missing person or even track a cheating spouse.\n\nThe MetroCard, used when boarding New York City buses and entering subway stations, has a magnetic strip that records the amount of money or time left on the card. Centralized computers also store data on where and when the cards are used, retrieving the information from buses and subway turnstiles.\n\nThe transit agency said that it receives requests from time to time to trace card information from the police, prosecutors and defense lawyers, but that it does not follow up on how those cases turn out.\n\nIn at least one instance, a MetroCard helped lead to a conviction. In 2002, on Staten Island, a man was found guilty of murdering his ex-girlfriend after the police used his MetroCard to prove that he was not on a bus when the killing occurred, as he claimed, but had in fact boarded it shortly afterward.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cElectronic evidence has become almost as important as DNA evidence,\u201d said James B. Dowd, the retired detective who recovered the MetroCard from jailhouse storage.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Jones brothers were arrested after a witness identified them as being involved in the murder of a man shortly after midnight on May 24, at Ogden Avenue and West 165th Street in the High Bridge section of the Bronx.\n\nThe witness, who has not been identified, said Corey Jones was arguing with the man and accused him of being a \u201csnitch.\u201d A short time later, the witness said, Corey handed Jason a gun, and Jason fired shots, killing the man. A call to 911 was made at 12:21 a.m., records show.\n\nThe Jones brothers already had a spotted past. Corey had convictions in two drug cases, Jason in a drug case and for stealing a car.\n\nBut both brothers have denied any involvement in the shooting, and Jason Jones said in an interview that when he was taken for questioning, he made it clear to the police that he could not have been involved.\n\n\u201cI told them they had the wrong person,\u201d he said. \u201cI was not there.\u201d\n\nDuring the interrogation, he said, it occurred to him that he had used his MetroCard on the bus and the subway, and he asked the police to check it. A detective took the card briefly, and then gave it back to him, and there was no further discussion about the card, he said.\n\nThe MetroCard came up again when Mr. Jones\u2019s own lawyers debriefed him.\n\n\u201cJason, from the outset, had a very good memory of where he had been,\u201d George R.

A printout of his hours showed that on May 23, the night of the killing, he had punched out at 11:01 p.m.\n\nMr. Jones had said that he and several co-workers then boarded a No. 20 Bee-Line bus near Central Park Avenue and Tuckahoe Road and rode into the Bronx, where they stopped at a check-cashing outlet, Pay-O-Matic, near Montefiore Medical Center.\n\nWhen Mr. Dowd visited Pay-O-Matic, he learned not only that it had a copy of Mr. Jones\u2019s check, but that it took photographs of customers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEverything was time stamped,\u201d Mr. Dowd recalled. A photograph shows Mr. Jones cashing his check at 11:39 p.m.\n\nMr. Dowd said Pay-O-Matic also had a photo of one of Mr. Jones\u2019s co-workers cashing a check, in which Mr. Jones was visible in the background. That further corroborated his story that he had had been with his co-workers that night.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Mr. Dowd still needed one more piece of evidence \u2014 the MetroCard.\n\nMr. Jones said that after cashing the check, he and his co-workers had walked to a friend\u2019s apartment for a drink, and that he had then entered the 205th Street station on the D Line, less than a mile from the check-cashing outlet and about five miles from the shooting scene. He rode the train to 182nd Street to visit his girlfriend, he said, stayed with her until about 2 a.m., and then took a subway home.\n\nAfter the investigator retrieved the MetroCard from the jail, Frederick H. Cohn, Mr. Jones\u2019s other lawyer, called New York City Transit and asked to have the card\u2019s history traced. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, how long is this going to take?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Cohn recalled.\n\nHe said the employee said it would take three months. \u201cShe said, \u2018We\u2019re very busy.

Using the serial number of Mr. Jones\u2019s seven-day unlimited MetroCard, the transit agency was able to report that Mr. Jones\u2019s card had been used three times that night \u2014 on the No. 20 bus (the Bee-Line, the Westchester County bus system, accepts MetroCards) at 11:12 p.m.; at the 205th Street station at 12:30 a.m.; and at the 182nd-183rd Street station at 2 a.m. \u2014 all as he had said.\n\nMr. Jones\u2019s lawyers say it would have been physically impossible for him to commit the crime and be where his MetroCard was used. They say the card was in his possession the whole time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOnce presented with the new information, prosecutors agreed that Mr. Jones could be released on bond.\n\nBut they objected strenuously when lawyers for his brother made a similar request. The prosecutors said that their witness might have been wrong about Jason, but had correctly identified Corey.\n\nThe judge, Victor Marrero of Federal District Court in Manhattan, earlier had refused to grant bail to Corey Jones, even after several witnesses said he had been with them at the time of the shooting. But, in a hearing last month, Judge Marrero suggested the new information could not be ignored.\n\n\u201cIt seems somewhat implausible,\u201d he said, that the government\u2019s witness saw the event and was \u201cright about one and mistaken about the other.\u201d\n\nThe judge granted Corey Jones bail. Prosecutors have not dropped the charges, and said in court last month that their investigation was continuing. They declined to comment about the case outside court.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Marrero paraphrased a saying about change by the Greek philosopher Heraclitus. The judge wrote: \u201cThe river now flowing by is not the same river that passed by yesterday.\u201d", "Good morning. Do you brine your Thanksgiving turkey? I have.

(Currently in order to do that I would have to tape a bird\u2019s wing to my forehead.) Which is to say: I used to brine. (I used to have hair!)\n\nNow I just salt the bird and let it sit in the fridge to dry for a day or so before roasting. Or I roast it with butter under the skin. I might brine a rare-breed heritage bird, skinny and lean. I would not brine a turkey bound for the fryer. (I\u2019ve done so and exploded it.) Circumstances matter: the kind of turkey; the method of cooking; the amount of free time I have between When I Can Get Out of Work and When the Guests Arrive.\n\nKim Severson explored the subject of turkey brines for the Food desk of The Times this week, discovering how after two decades of flying high, the practice has been losing altitude among the food-media influencers (it me?) who first sent it soaring.

But there are ways to improve these institutions. Currently they are rewarded according to the number of prisoners they house. What if private prison contracts were structured so that they made more money if they treated prisoners humanely with policies that helped them stay out of trouble once released? Prisons exist to lower crime rates. So why not reward private prisons for doing that? Judge them on performance, as Mr. Beasley said.\n\nAmerica doesn\u2019t use performance-based contracts. But Australia and New Zealand are experimenting with these models. Two relatively new private prisons have contracts that give them bonuses for doing better than government prisons at cutting recidivism. They get an even bigger bonus if they beat the government at reducing recidivism among their indigenous populations. And prison companies are charged for what the government deems as unacceptable events like riots, escapes and unnatural deaths.\n\nAlthough the contracts set specific objectives, they do not dictate how prison operators should achieve them. \u201cIf we want to establish a prison that focuses on rehabilitation and reintegration, we have to give the private sector the space to innovate,\u201d said Rachael Cole, a former public-private partnership integration director for the New Zealand Department of Corrections. \u201cIf we don\u2019t give them the opportunity to do things differently, we will just get back what we already have.\u201d\n\nI recently visited New Zealand\u2019s Auckland South Corrections Facility, a low-lying yellow and white brick structure in the shadow of the local airport.

I thought back to my freshman year of college in 1992. As I sat in a computer room in my dorm working away on an early Macintosh, a red squiggly line immediately appeared underneath the word \u201cChicano\u201d after I typed it into the paper I was writing about my family\u2019s background. When I hit the spell check to see what the problem was, Microsoft Word had a suggestion: Chicago. \u201cYou don\u2019t even exist,\u201d popped into my head. Unfortunately, this wasn\u2019t a new experience. Years earlier, in middle school, I\u2019d been asked to fill out a form that included a question about my background. There were three options to choose from: black, white or other. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not black or white,\u201d I remember thinking, pencil in hand, \u201cbut I don\u2019t like the sound of \u2018other.\u2019\u201d I left it blank.\n\nFor many Latinos, stories like these are all too familiar. In \u201cLatinx: The New Force in American Politics and Culture,\u201d Ed Morales fills in that blank as well as the long, painful, complex and intersectional struggle for identity that has shaped America\u2019s Latino community. As Morales notes, Latinx is just the latest in a series of terms, from Hispanic to Latino/a and even Latin@, employed to refer to individuals of Latin American heritage in an inclusive way.\n\nReading Morales\u2019s dissection of Latinx identity formation, however, one begins to believe that the x in \u201cLatinx\u201d is more than just a means of providing gender-neutrality. As in algebra, the x is variable. How a Latino or Latina perceives himself or herself \u2014 and how he or she is perceived by others \u2014 often depends on context. Unhappy with the binary notion of race popular in the United States, Morales offers the concept of mestizaje, or hybridity, that encompasses a spectrum of identity, the result of hundreds of years of intermixing among African, European and indigenous peoples in Mexico, Latin America and the Caribbean. Latinos can be black, white, brown or anything in between. Skin color, national origin, whether one lives in the mainland United States or outside of it, and one\u2019s ability to speak Spanish, not to mention gender and sexual orientation, all play a role in one\u2019s self-concept.", "Story creates culture. It teaches us to feel, think and behave in ways generally approved of by those around us. Story conditions us. This conditioning, or bias, is not always visible to us, but it constrains and guides our behavior. Implicit bias can\u2019t be changed until we learn to see the old, embedded story and then find a new and better story to overwrite it.\n\nI am a queer, disabled writer who grew up Catholic in the north of England at the fulcrum of two competing stories. In Yorkshire, even more than 400 years after the reign of Henry VIII, Catholics were a small, feared and embattled minority \u2014 as a 9-year-old I was spat upon in the street for raising money for a Catholic charity. It was confusing because to me, my family, friends and teachers (mostly nuns), Catholics were Good, the norm. Out on the street, and to our neighbors, Catholics were Bad, other. So I was aware of dueling cultural narratives, and this, perhaps, is what inoculated me against other cultural stories \u2014 though only partially.\n\nWhen I was very young \u2014 4 or 5, before I was fully sexual \u2014 I knew I was a girl who liked other girls. I didn\u2019t really think about it \u2014 it just was, utterly obvious. It seemed perfectly natural to me because no one thought to talk about sexuality to a 4-year-old, and queer people \u2014 and their treatment by society \u2014 was invisible to me. So I was free to tell my own story: that I was amazing, and that if I fancied girls, then fancying girls must be amazing, too.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was 9 or 10 that I found out that the dominant story of queerness \u2014 as told by family, church, school, neighbors and books like the tortured 1928 lesbian novel \u201cThe Well of Loneliness\u201d \u2014 was that it was Bad. But by then I also had experience of the cultural story of Catholicism being not entirely true, so it wasn\u2019t too hard to counterprogram anti-lesbian bias with my own, better story. As a result, I did not develop internalized homophobia \u2014 or thought I hadn\u2019t.", "Another strategy: For every five days of your trip, set aside one for planned spontaneity. In the city?

People were delighted to teach me \u2014 though, I imagine, not nearly so much as the English would be to talk about why their football team is superior.\n\nSay \u201cyes\u201d\n\nSometimes an opportunity for a detour or a change of plans will arise that you (or your travel companions) might think is silly or a little nerve-racking.\n\nShould we turn down that side street just to see what\u2019s there? Should we get off at a random subway stop and explore? Stop off at a supermarket to see what kinds of cereal they have? Attend that local community potluck we saw a flier for? The answers are yes, yes, yes and yes. What do you have to lose if it goes well? The second museum or third monument of the day? And what if it doesn\u2019t? You\u2019ll be set back 15 minutes? There\u2019s really only one good reason to say no to an idea: if it would put you in physical danger.\n\nDespite what you learned as a kid, \u201cyes\u201d is also the answer to: Should you talk to strangers? (At least when culturally appropriate.) I sometimes like to set a goal \u2014 to talk to five random people a day, for example. Then I ask any dumb question that comes to mind. At a restaurant in Naples, I asked the Italian family at the table next to mine how their fritti misti appetizer was. They gave me the rest of the plate. I asked a fellow customer in a South Dakota gas station if there was any difference between the pot of coffee she was pouring and the one she wasn\u2019t. It was fresher, she said. I doubt it was, and didn\u2019t care anyway, but she turned out to be a fun Estonian exchange student with great stories of her journeys across America.\n\nSeek community\n\nGreat things also happen when your family or friends or friends of friends live in your destination. So seek out your Hungarian third cousins and the Vietnamese college roommate of your high school prom date for a meal or tea or some advice. No connections? Search for clubs or groups or professional organizations in your areas of interest. Surgeons may seek to tour a local hospital; journalists a newsroom; police officers a precinct. There\u2019s no harm in trying. It just takes a quick search for accountants heading to Barbados to find an email for the I.C.A.B. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of Barbados, a real organization). The worst thing that could happen is nothing. Maybe you\u2019ll score some great tips on beaches or night life or even make a friend. You don\u2019t have to actually want to learn anything from the B.S.C. (Barcelona Sweater Club, a made-up organization) . You\u2019re just looking for a way to make a connection.\n\nSeth Kugel, a former Frugal Traveler columnist, is the author of \u201cRediscovering Travel: A Guide for the Globally Curious\u201d (Norton), published on Nov. 13.\n\nFollow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

The new guidelines, which represent a scientific consensus about how much and what types of physical activities we should complete for good health, bear a strong resemblance to the existing, 10-year-old governmental recommendations. But they also feature some important updates and expansions, including the first-ever federal activity parameters for 3-year-olds, as well as a few surprising omissions.\n\nAnd they offer a subtle, admonitory reminder that a substantial majority of us are not moving nearly as much as we should.\n\nThe idea that the government might suggest how much we need to exercise is relatively new. The first federal exercise recommendations were released in 2008, after several years of scientific background study.", "While Victoria wouldn\u2019t discuss her mortality with anyone (that was off the table), she resolved herself to conquer whatever the medical team asked of her. Each day she walked further, sat in a chair longer, tried to eat when she could keep things down. The housekeepers stopped by to talk with Victoria every morning. She knew their names, and the names of their children. Jos\u00e9 spoke of his son\u2019s difficulties with school. Victoria listened and made suggestions. She knew the nurses\u2019 names and concerns as well; how long their commutes were, how they tried to balance the personal and professional demands in their lives.\n\nOver time, Victoria became increasingly grateful for the kindness and compassion of others, whether it came from her husband, Pat, who stayed with her each day (my visits provided necessary respite for him); or from her sons, Nick and Will, whose faces beamed at her from large poster-size photos they had placed in her room; or from the friends who looked after her family, feeding them every day for the eight-plus months of her continuous hospitalization.\n\nSitting with Victoria allowed me to reconnect with a part of myself I had been suppressing for years. Her courage rubbed off on me. Blood test results set the expectations for each new day. A higher white blood count would allow Victoria the freedom to step from her room into the hallway to take a few steps around her unit, albeit with a thick filtration mask covering her mouth and nose. If her counts were low, she would sit confined to her room, often for days on end, gazing longingly through a sealed window at people six stories below walking the garden paths and at the trees swaying in the breeze.\n\nI went to City of Hope to support my sister, and what I found there was gratitude: appreciation for others; reveling in small pleasures we usually take for granted, like a hot shower, sunlight, a walk outdoors.\n\nVictoria\u2019s gift was a tangible lesson, something I have been able to carry with me. Now I approach patients differently than I did before her illness.\n\nRecently, I met Meghan White, a 34-year-old woman with breast cancer that had metastasized to her brain. I was initially hesitant and fearful as I entered the examining room to see her one afternoon after a long day in clinic. She was going to need me to surgically place a reservoir into her brain to deliver chemotherapy. My colleagues and I also planned to perform focused radiation treatments to two tumors in her brain that were growing quickly. Meghan sat bald and proudly beautiful in my examining room, her mother there to support her.\n\nPreviously, I would have thought nothing of her shaved head, but now I understood Meghan had a story to tell. As they were with Victoria, the odds were long against her.", "Given that drunken sexual activity, whether straight or same-sex, can involve higher risks and lower rewards than sober encounters, one might be tempted to dismiss young people as reckless or senseless for engaging in it. But my work as a psychologist has taught me that adolescents always have reasons for making choices that seem to be against their own self-interest. Taking these reasons seriously opens up conversations that may help our adolescents look after themselves and their partners down the line.\n\nSo why do young people mix sex and alcohol?\n\nTeens Drink Because They\u2019re Nervous About Intimacy\n\nTeenagers may view all anxiety as problematic and drink to blunt the jitters that are a natural part of a budding romantic life. Unfortunately, anxiety, like stress, has gotten a bad rap. Nerves can get out of control, but feeling occasionally anxious is a normal and healthy part of life. And what could be more normal than feeling awkward about physical intimacy, especially when it is new and unfamiliar?\n\nWe do right by young people when we acknowledge that apprehension is to be expected in the early days of physical romance or when being intimate with a new person. As the psychologist Richard Weissbourd, the faculty director of Harvard University\u2019s Making Caring Common Project, explains, the first forays into sexual activity are bound to be anxiety-provoking because that they are often \u201coverloaded with expectations as well as worries about performance.\u201d\n\nIt helps to remind teenagers that their nerves are not only normal, but designed to keep them safe. \u201cWhen it comes to your love life,\u201d we might say, \u201chaving butterflies can be part of the fun. But if you find yourself in a situation that makes you really nervous, pay attention to that warning signal. The last thing you should do is start drinking to relax.\u201d\n\nThey Think Everybody Else Is Having Drunken Hookups\n\nThe popular media has done its part to suggest that drunken one-night stands have replaced courtship and romance among young people. According to Ms. Orenstein, \u201cThis is the script that gets handed down: You\u2019re supposed to get super wasted and have sex with somebody.\u201d When teenagers believe they should be making out with virtual strangers, \u201cthe only way to do that,\u201d notes Ms. Orenstein, is to drink \u201cto numb their anxiety and embarrassment about it.\u201d", "Movies have been teaching us lessons for their entire history, gently suggesting and outright lecturing us on how to live. They teach us how to be good or very, very bad. They teach us how to smile and flirt, fight and surrender. They teach how to be a man, how to be a woman.\n\nMovies are a space for dreams and for fantasies, including those that sometimes make us uneasy, squirm or rage. If you are a woman, you probably have wondered whose dreams are these, anyway? From \u201cSnow White\u201d to \u201cGone With the Wind,\u201d films have taught us that women are to be kissed, at times even violently. Other movies, from \u201cHalloween\u201d to \u201cGravity,\u201d have taught us that women can take care of themselves. They fight and survive.

It named her its 2018 \u201cWoman\u201d of the Year \u2014 and the quotation marks made a troubling difference to her fans.\n\nThe men\u2019s fashion magazine unveiled the covers of its upcoming issue this week \u2014 one cover for Ms. Williams, three others for GQ\u2019s Men of the Year \u2014 and was immediately denounced on social media. Ms. Williams, one of history\u2019s most accomplished tennis players, has a muscular physique, which she said last year has resulted in people calling her a man or telling her she belongs in men\u2019s sports.\n\nCritics said the magazine\u2019s use of quotation marks around \u201cwoman\u201d on Ms. Williams\u2019s cover appeared to call into question her gender or her femininity, a trope with at least a touch of transphobia.", "\u201cI worked on it for two years and then \u2026 fell to the wayside,\u201d she said. \u201cMy ego was bruised and I did feel like I was kicked in the gut a little bit.

But if I am playing a role, I\u2019d much rather the audience forget that I\u2019m Stephanie. My husband likes to call me the Gary Oldman of musical theater because I have this way of shapeshifting.\u201d\n\nEven in \u201cI\u2019m Breaking Down,\u201d her epically funny, showstopping number in \u201cFalsettos,\u201d Ms. Block stayed true to the character. \u201cAnother actor might have hamboned the whole thing but she was always honest,\u201d said that revival\u2019s director, James Lapine, who had grasped the full extent of the actress\u2019 range when he saw her in the Lynn Nottage play \u201cBy the Way, Meet Vera Stark,\u201d in 2011 \u2014 another portrayal of a larger-than-life star, that one fictional. \u201cI hope she gets [more] dramatic roles because that would be an eye-opener for folks. She\u2019s emotionally available, as they like to say,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\nThis openness is evident in the close relationship Ms. Block has forged with the other Chers. Tellingly, she is quick to boast not so much about her own role but about the team spirit that animates the trio. \u201cYou have to set aside your ego, you have to set aside your expectations, you have to set aside your personal agenda,\u201d she said animatedly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to look at your fellow sister-actors and say, \u2018What is you is me, what is me is you.

Dignity Health and Catholic Health Initiatives, two large chains, are expected to become one of the nation\u2019s largest groups \u2014 with 139 hospitals in 28 states \u2014 by the end of the year. And two of Texas\u2019 biggest systems, Baylor Scott & White Health and Memorial Hermann Health System, recently announced plans to combine.\n\nThe New Haven area has witnessed the most significant decline in competition. Yale New Haven Health, one of the largest hospital groups in Connecticut, took over the only competing hospital in the city and has also aggressively expanded along the state\u2019s coast. The group recently added another hospital to its collection, merging Milford with its Bridgeport location.\n\nAlthough the price of a hospital admission in the New Haven-Milford area was already three times higher than in other parts of the state, prices surged by 25 percent from 2012 to 2014, compared with 7 percent elsewhere in the state, according to the Petris Center.\n\nIn the national analysis, a third of the metropolitan areas experienced increases in the cost of hospital stays of at least 25 percent from 2012 to 2014, from roughly $12,000 to at least $15,000.\n\nPrices rise even more steeply when these large hospital systems buy doctors\u2019 groups, according to Richard Scheffler, director of the Petris Center.", "In Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh, now home to the world\u2019s largest refugee camp, one of the people who found her name on a repatriation list said she had no idea how she was picked to return. The woman, whose name is not being used for her protection, said she had no wish to return to Myanmar.\n\nThe United Nations said that at least two elderly men in the refugee camps had attempted suicide rather than face the possibility of returning to the site of crimes against the Rohingya.\n\nRepatriations to Myanmar are supposed to be safe, voluntary and dignified, according to a bilateral agreement. But Myanmar officials have repeatedly rejected reports of mass violence committed against the Rohingya, who are Muslims in a majority Buddhist country.\n\nTwo reporters for Reuters who documented a mass grave in Rakhine State, where the Rohingya are from, are now in prison, sentenced to seven-year terms.

Ebsworth, the Seattle-based travel entrepreneur and renowned collector of American art, who died in April. Reportedly long-promised to the Seattle Art Museum, this much-exhibited painting of two young women seated in a sunlit Chinese restaurant had been estimated to go for $70 million to $100 million.\n\n\u201cReally, $100 million for a Hopper?

It followed a robust 3 percent annualized growth in the previous quarter.\n\nA decline in domestic demand was the biggest reason the economy shrank, as strong typhoons and a powerful earthquake halted factories and stifled consumption, although economists say this disruption was temporary and the decline in exports is more worrying.\n\nExternal demand \u2014 or exports minus imports \u2014 shaved one-tenth of a percentage point off gross domestic product.

A recording shared by Turkish officials with the C.I.A. captured a member of the kill team instructing a superior over the phone to \u201ctell your boss\u201d that the operation had been carried out.\n\nThe lack of an ambassador in either Saudi Arabia and Turkey has been a point of contention since Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death, underscoring that many important diplomatic posts remain unfilled nearly two years into Mr. Trump\u2019s administration, some because no one has been nominated and others because the Senate has not acted.\n\nMr. Trump has promised \u201csevere punishment\u201d if it were demonstrated that the Saudis were behind the killing, but he has resisted curbing arms sales as lawmakers in both parties have urged. His Middle East strategy to confront Iran and force Palestinians to make peace with Israel has relied largely on Saudi Arabia, a relationship cultivated by Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, with Prince Mohammed.\n\nGeneral Abizaid, 67, graduated from West Point, where his 1973 yearbook described him as \u201can Arabian Vince Lombardi\u201d in that he \u201cjust couldn\u2019t accept second place.\u201d He spent 34 years in the Army, rising from infantry platoon leader to a celebrated four-star general.

The Warriors had lost two of three games, Curry had been sidelined indefinitely with a groin injury, and an argument between Kevin Durant and Draymond Green during Monday\u2019s 121-116 overtime loss to the Los Angeles Clippers had led to a one-game suspension for Green, a three-time All-Star and the 2017 defensive player of the year.\n\nThe suspension, which the team said was for \u201cconduct detrimental to the team,\u201d will cost Green an estimated $120,480, but the ramifications could run far deeper. To many, the punishment seemed to indicate that the happiness of Durant, who is widely expected to opt out of his contract and become a free agent this off-season, is the team\u2019s top priority.\n\nThe Warriors managed to save face in the immediate wake of the suspension, beating the lowly Atlanta Hawks, 110-103, on Tuesday thanks to 29 points from Durant.

She later made the same accusation to the police and to prosecutors, but the Manhattan district attorney declined to press charges.\n\nNow, she is seeking redress in a state Superior Court in California.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed on Tuesday, Ms. de la Huerta said that her sexual encounters with Mr. Weinstein \u2014 two in Manhattan and one in Los Angeles \u2014 drove her to drink and shattered her emotionally. She also accused him, without providing evidence, of torpedoing her career on the HBO drama \u201cBoardwalk Empire.\u201d\n\nHer lawyer, Aaron G. Filler, said the lawsuit seeks to use archived photos to corroborate Ms. de la Huerta\u2019s claims, showing that she and Mr. Weinstein were at the locations where she has said the assaults occurred.\n\n\u201cWe commenced an investigation to get data to corroborate the specific dates,\u201d Mr. Filler said in an interview. \u201cWe relied on archival photography to show the dates of the initial event, the second rape in New York and the third event in Los Angeles.\u201d", "[What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\n\nLawyers for Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, the infamous drug lord known as El Chapo, claimed on Tuesday that for decades their client had been framed by a vast conspiracy of plotters, including his chief lieutenant in the Sinaloa cartel, American drug agents, and the last two presidents of Mexico.\n\nThe defense\u2019s claim was an unexpected start to Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s drug conspiracy trial, which after several delays on Tuesday began under tight security in Federal District Court in Brooklyn.\n\nDuring an impassioned opening statement, one of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers, Jeffrey Lichtman, said that the real mastermind of the cartel, which Mr. Guzm\u00e1n has been accused of running for decades, was his longtime partner Ismael Zambada Garcia.\n\nDescribing Mr. Guzm\u00e1n as no more than \u201ca scapegoat,\u201d Mr. Lichtman argued that Mr. Zambada, known as El Mayo, had been the one to oversee 20 years of drug shipments into the United States, and who repeatedly paid off \u2014 to the tune of millions of dollars \u2014 a \u201ccompletely corrupt\u201d Mexican government, including top officials like President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and his predecessor, Felipe Calder\u00f3n.", "Given the size of Rick Scott\u2019s lead in the race for a United States Senate seat from Florida and Ron DeSantis\u2019s lead in the race to be the state\u2019s governor, most election experts agree there\u2019s little chance that even the most exquisitely careful recount would deny these two Republicans victory.\n\nYet both men are not only acting as if it\u2019s 2000 all over again, when control of the White House hinged on a few hundred votes in Florida, they are also fanning conspiratorial flames with claims of outrageous fraud, seconded by President Trump.\n\nThe flimsiness of their charges can be measured by the response they\u2019ve gotten not from their political adversaries but from some of their allies.\n\nMr. Scott, who as governor is overseeing his election to become senator, asked his Department of Law Enforcement to investigate this supposedly rampant fraud in Democratic-controlled Broward County. No real accusations to investigate, he was told. At a court hearing at which Republicans asked him to impound voting machines in Broward County, a county judge who had been appointed by a Republican governor, Jeb Bush, told everyone to calm down.", "WASHINGTON \u2014 For weeks before the midterm elections, President Trump warned ominously about the threat from a caravan of migrants streaming from Central America toward Mexico\u2019s border with the United States. It was a fearsome mix of criminals and \u201cunknown Middle Easterners,\u201d Mr. Trump claimed darkly, one that constituted a genuine national emergency.\n\nBut since the election last week, Mr. Trump has tweeted about the caravan exactly once \u2014 to issue a proclamation preventing those who cross the border illegally from applying for asylum in the United States. Fox News, which faithfully amplified Mr. Trump\u2019s warnings about the migrants, has gone similarly quiet on the subject.\n\nThere was little dispute, even before Election Day, that Mr. Trump was exploiting the caravan for political purposes. But analysts, historians and veterans of previous administrations said there were few comparable instances of a commander in chief warning about what he called a looming threat, only to drop it as soon as people voted.\n\nWhile the caravan has faded from television screens, the costs of Mr. Trump\u2019s response to it have not. Nearly 6,000 active-duty troops remain deployed from the Gulf Coast to Southern California, where they are putting up tents and stringing concertina wire to face a ragtag band that is still not near the border.", "A California man pleaded guilty on Tuesday to making dozens of hoax phone calls during which he reported fake crimes, including one high-profile call last year that resulted in another man in Wichita, Kan., being fatally shot by a police officer.\n\nUnder a plea agreement, the caller, Tyler Barriss, 25, of Los Angeles, will serve between 20 and 25 years in prison for making the false reports by phone, a practice known as swatting.\n\nProsecutors say that in addition to initiating the swatting episode in Kansas \u2014 where he entered his plea on Tuesday \u2014 Mr. Barriss made dozens of other, similar calls to emergency and law enforcement agencies across the country during which he falsely reported bomb threats, active shootings and other criminal activity at high schools, shopping malls and even the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nNo one was injured or killed as a result of those calls. It was the Wichita episode \u2014 for which Mr. Barriss pleaded guilty to cyberstalking, conspiracy and making a false report resulting in a death \u2014 that drew attention to the potentially deadly consequences of swatting.

He cited a report that a handful of voters in Bay County, a predominantly white Gulf Coast area ravaged by Hurricane Michael last month, were allowed to cast votes by email or fax while voters in more diverse counties on Florida\u2019s densely populated East coast were screened more rigorously.\n\n\u201cIn Bay County they were accepting votes by email,\u201d he told his audience in Boynton Beach \u2014 12 miles south of the president\u2019s golf resort and Winter White House, Mar-a-Lago. \u201cThat was a deeply red county, a county I competed for even though I knew it was a deeply Republican area. But they want to question a man or a woman around here who stood 30 or 45 minutes or an hour in line?\u201d\n\nMr. Gillum\u2019s penchant for punching back has created an unusually deep bond between the mayor and African-American Floridians, who make about 13 percent of the state\u2019s registered voters.", "\u88ab\u6355\u7576\u6642\uff0c\u4ed6\u4e0d\u662f\u4f86\u505a\u751f\u610f\u7684\u3002\u4ed6\u5728\u7f8e\u570b\u7576\u5b78\u751f\uff0c\u767d\u5929\u4e0a\u8ab2\uff0c\u665a\u4e0a\u53c3\u52a0\u6d3e\u5c0d\u3002\u90a3\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u91dd\u5c0d\u4e9e\u6d32\u4f01\u696d\u9ad8\u7ba1\u7684\u535a\u58eb\u8ab2\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u4e00\u53f0\u91d1\u9322\u88fd\u9020\u6a5f\u3002\u660e\u5927\u8207\u6e05\u83ef\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5411\u6bcf\u4f4d\u5b78\u751f\u6536\u53d6\u6578\u5341\u842c\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u5149\u5b78\u8cbb\u4e00\u9805\uff0c\u5c31\u6709\u671b\u70ba\u8a72\u6821\u6bcf\u671f\u589e\u65361000\u842c\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u6307\u63a7\u4ed6\u6027\u4fb5\u7684\u5973\u5b69\u5c31\u662f\u9019\u500b\u9805\u76ee\u7684\u5fd7\u9858\u8005\u3002\n\n\u800c\u5728\u6b64\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u660e\u5927\u5c31\u5df2\u7d93\u6df1\u9677\u591a\u8d77\u6027\u919c\u805e\u3002\u53bb\u5e74\u4e00\u5e74\uff0c\u6821\u5167\u6709\u7d71\u8a08\u7684\u6027\u9a37\u64fe\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9054\u523068\u8d77\uff0c\u63d0\u4ea4\u8b66\u65b9\u53ea\u670912\u8d77\u30022016\u5e74\uff0c\u8a72\u6821\u652f\u4ed8\u4e8628.2\u842c\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u89e3\u6c7a\u4e86\u91dd\u5c0d\u5176\u524d\u9ad4\u80b2\u4e3b\u7ba1\u7684\u6027\u9a37\u64fe\u6295\u8a34\u3002\u540c\u5e74\uff0c\u6a44\u6b16\u7403\u6821\u968a\u7684\u5e7e\u540d\u904b\u52d5\u54e1\u88ab\u63a7\u8f2a\u59e6\u4e00\u540d\u5973\u5b78\u751f\u3002\n\n\u660e\u5927\u5df2\u7d93\u63a1\u53d6\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u57f9\u8a13\u6559\u5e2b\u548c\u5b78\u751f\u61c9\u5c0d\u6b64\u985e\u72c0\u6cc1\uff0c\u4e26\u8981\u6c42\u5728\u985e\u4f3c\u60c5\u6cc1\u767c\u751f\u6642\u901a\u77e5\u6821\u65b9\u3002\u4f46\u5289\u5f37\u6771\u6848\u518d\u6b21\u8b93\u7ba1\u7406\u5c64\u9677\u5165\u5169\u96e3\u5883\u5730\uff0c\u5b83\u8a66\u5716\u540c\u6642\u4fdd\u8b77\u5b78\u751f\u548c\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8072\u8b7d\uff0c\u4f46\u5169\u6a23\u90fd\u986f\u5f97\u4e0d\u592a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u6279\u8a55\u8005\u7a31\uff0c\u5b78\u6821\u672c\u61c9\u62ff\u51fa\u7acb\u5834\uff0c\u537b\u4e00\u76f4\u4fdd\u6301\u7dd8\u9ed8\u3002\n\n_____\n\n\n\n\u2022 \u7dad\u5dde\u52a0\u5165\u300c\u4e00\u5e36\u4e00\u8def\u300d\uff0c\u6fb3\u6d32\u7e3d\u7406\u300c\u5f88\u9a5a\u8a1d\u300d", "Inside Dr. Snipes\u2019s office in Lauderhill, Fla., away from all the drama, workers were beginning the process on Tuesday of actually running ballots through counting machines. They had spent the first two days of the recount sorting the ballots, picking out the pages that needed to be tallied again.\n\nAs the process unfolded, there was no denying that all eyes were on Dr. Snipes. In a tweet on Monday, Mr. Bush joined the chorus of Republican officials denouncing her. Among the issues was the Senate race, in which the Republican candidate, Gov. Rick Scott, had a razor-thin lead over Senator Bill Nelson, the Democratic incumbent. Dr. Snipes was accused by Mr. Scott and other Republicans of unfairly tipping the scales for her party, though no evidence of that was put forward.\n\n\u201cThere is no question Snipes failed to comply with Florida law on multiple counts, undermining Floridians\u2019 confidence in our electoral process. Supervisor Snipes should be removed from her office following recounts,\u201d Mr. Bush wrote.\n\nDr. Snipes, 75, who said she had never before been the subject of such harsh personal attacks, acknowledged that Mr. Bush had appointed her originally, but she also noted that she was later elected to the post in 2004 and then re-elected every four years since.\n\n\u201cIf that is Jeb Bush\u2019s opinion, then there\u2019s nothing I can do about that,\u201d she said from the canvassing room of her office in the Lauderhill Mall. \u201cThat\u2019s an opinion.\u201d", "\u88ab\u6355\u5f53\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4e0d\u662f\u6765\u505a\u751f\u610f\u7684\u3002\u4ed6\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u5f53\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u767d\u5929\u4e0a\u8bfe\uff0c\u665a\u4e0a\u53c2\u52a0\u6d3e\u5bf9\u3002\u90a3\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u4e9a\u6d32\u4f01\u4e1a\u9ad8\u7ba1\u7684\u535a\u58eb\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u4e00\u53f0\u91d1\u94b1\u5236\u9020\u673a\u3002\u660e\u5927\u4e0e\u6e05\u534e\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5411\u6bcf\u4f4d\u5b66\u751f\u6536\u53d6\u6570\u5341\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u5149\u5b66\u8d39\u4e00\u9879\uff0c\u5c31\u6709\u671b\u4e3a\u8be5\u6821\u6bcf\u671f\u589e\u65361000\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u6307\u63a7\u4ed6\u6027\u4fb5\u7684\u5973\u5b69\u5c31\u662f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u5fd7\u613f\u8005\u3002\n\n\u800c\u5728\u6b64\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u660e\u5927\u5c31\u5df2\u7ecf\u6df1\u9677\u591a\u8d77\u6027\u4e11\u95fb\u3002\u53bb\u5e74\u4e00\u5e74\uff0c\u6821\u5185\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u6027\u9a9a\u6270\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8fbe\u523068\u8d77\uff0c\u63d0\u4ea4\u8b66\u65b9\u53ea\u670912\u8d77\u30022016\u5e74\uff0c\u8be5\u6821\u652f\u4ed8\u4e8628.2\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5176\u524d\u4f53\u80b2\u4e3b\u7ba1\u7684\u6027\u9a9a\u6270\u6295\u8bc9\u3002\u540c\u5e74\uff0c\u6a44\u6984\u7403\u6821\u961f\u7684\u51e0\u540d\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u88ab\u63a7\u8f6e\u5978\u4e00\u540d\u5973\u5b66\u751f\u3002\n\n\u660e\u5927\u5df2\u7ecf\u91c7\u53d6\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u57f9\u8bad\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u5e94\u5bf9\u6b64\u7c7b\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u8981\u6c42\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3c\u60c5\u51b5\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u901a\u77e5\u6821\u65b9\u3002\u4f46\u5218\u5f3a\u4e1c\u6848\u518d\u6b21\u8ba9\u7ba1\u7406\u5c42\u9677\u5165\u4e24\u96be\u5883\u5730\uff0c\u5b83\u8bd5\u56fe\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u5b66\u751f\u548c\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u58f0\u8a89\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u6837\u90fd\u663e\u5f97\u4e0d\u592a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u6279\u8bc4\u8005\u79f0\uff0c\u5b66\u6821\u672c\u5e94\u62ff\u51fa\u7acb\u573a\uff0c\u5374\u4e00\u76f4\u4fdd\u6301\u7f04\u9ed8\u3002\n\n_____\n\n\n\n\u2022 \u7ef4\u5dde\u52a0\u5165\u201c\u4e00\u5e26\u4e00\u8def\u201d\uff0c\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u603b\u7406\u201c\u5f88\u60ca\u8bb6\u201d", "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 Amid the blur of lawsuits and noise around the recount in Florida\u2019s Senate race lies a possible outcome that could be the ultimate twist: Senator Bill Nelson may not win the election, even if he wins the election.\n\nThat is because the Constitution says that the ultimate arbiter of who gets a Senate seat is the Senate itself \u2014 not election officials or the courts.\n\nThat would not seem to bode well for the Democrats or their incumbent, Mr. Nelson. Though he trails his Republican opponent, Gov. Rick Scott, the margin has dwindled to about 13,000 votes; Mr. Nelson hopes to make that up in the recount and take the lead.\n\nIf that were to happen, though, it is not unthinkable that Republicans would consider using their majority power in the Senate to refuse to seat Mr. Nelson and to give the seat to Mr. Scott instead \u2014 especially considering how he and his party have repeatedly insisted, without offering evidence, that the ballot review process has been riddled with fraud and misconduct.", "Mr. McCarthy, a golden retriever of a man who hates to be by himself, once cozied up to the president by bringing him a curated jar of his favorite cherry and strawberry Starburst candies. He excels at building the kind of relationships that his allies say will be crucial to leading an effective minority.\n\n\u201cIf Kevin McCarthy is alone, does he exist?\u201d joked Representative Patrick T. McHenry, Republican of North Carolina, alluding to the Californian\u2019s uber-social nature. \u201cHe thrives on human interaction, and that is his natural sweet spot, and I think this job, the job of minority leader, is a matter of knitting us all together.\u201d\n\nIt is common for lawmakers and strategists to preface their remarks about Mr. McCarthy by noting that he is \u201cnot a policy guy,\u201d which can double in Washington as a euphemistic put-down, the legislative equivalent of saying that a potential mate has a great personality. There is no denying that Mr. McCarthy, who is known for his encyclopedic knowledge of congressional districts and warm relationships with rank-and-file Republicans, has less interest in the technical details of policy than Mr. Ryan of Wisconsin, who revels in his reputation as an \u201cideas guy.\u201d\n\nAnd Mr. McCarthy is not always savvy about how he approaches an issue. When he decided six weeks before the midterm contests to introduce a bill to fully fund Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall over seven years, he neither worked with the White House nor gave advance notice that it was coming, according to two people familiar with the conversations who spoke of condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment.\n\nStill, for Republicans licking their wounds from this month\u2019s drubbing and looking toward a grim two years in the minority where they have little ability to influence policy, Mr. McCarthy\u2019s political talents appear to be matched to the moment.\n\nGroomed by Bill Thomas, the former House Ways and Means Committee chairman who represented his Bakersfield district, the bubbly Mr. McCarthy succeeded his more cerebral and irascible boss in 2007 and quickly worked his way up through Republican ranks, rising to the third-ranking position within four years. He was one of the \u201cYoung Guns,\u201d a triumvirate of 40-something conservatives including Mr. Ryan and Eric Cantor who styled themselves the future of the Republican Party, and published a book whose cover depicted them all, smiling and impressively coifed, on the balcony of the Capitol.\n\nMr. Cantor, then the No. 2 Republican, was defeated in a primary in 2014 by Dave Brat, a college professor who harnessed Tea Party discontent to topple him, and Mr. McCarthy slid easily into the job. (Mr. Brat is among the Republicans swept out by Democrats in last week\u2019s elections.) A year later, Mr. Boehner, facing a revolt from the Freedom Caucus, was forced out as speaker. Mr. McCarthy was the presumed heir apparent, but he stumbled over policy pronouncements and infuriated allies by blurting out that a committee investigating the Benghazi attacks was created to sink Hillary Clinton\u2019s popularity. He took himself out of the running.\n\nNow Mr. Ryan, another Young Gun, is retiring, and the lone survivor, Mr. McCarthy, is in line for the top job.", "At first, Ms. Cilley, a Democrat, said she was sure Ms. Levesque had to be mistaken. When she realized that Ms. Levesque was right, she said she was astonished \u2014 and thought that changing the law to raise the age would be an easy lift.\n\n\u201cHow could anybody defend the practice of 13-year-olds getting married?\u201d she said.\n\nBut a bill Ms. Cilley championed, which would have raised the minimum age for marriage, ran into a wall of opposition from her Republican colleagues. Among critics of the idea was Representative David Bates, the lawmaker who dismissed Ms. Levesque as \u201ca minor doing a Girl Scout project.\u201d (Mr. Bates, who did not respond to a message left at his home, did not run for re-election this year.)\n\nIn March 2017, Republicans killed the bill, using a procedural move intended to keep it from being considered again for two years.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t make me want to stop \u2014 it just made me want to push forward,\u201d Ms. Levesque said. This year, with Ms. Levesque continuing to press the issue, Ms. Cilley and several of her colleagues passed a trio of bills which raised the minimum marriage age to 16 and gave judges more guidance about how to consider petitions for marriage licenses from people 17 and younger.\n\nIn the meantime, Ms. Levesque graduated from high school and went off to study photography at the New Hampshire Institute of Art, before deciding that a career in photography was not for her, and coming home. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do wedding photos,\u201d she said.\n\nTwo seats in the State House of Representatives for Barrington would soon be open, and local Democrats urged Ms. Levesque to run. She said she had hesitated at first. She worried about balancing political office with college classes and with her commitments as a leader of her own Girl Scout troop. Also, she didn\u2019t know how she would get to Concord; she doesn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license.\n\nOn the next-to-last day that she could file papers to run, she did.\n\nIn Concord, Ms. Levesque will certainly stand out. As of 2015, the average age in the New Hampshire State Legislature was 66, making it the oldest state legislature in the country, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. One reason is that the State Legislature is essentially a volunteer job, with the legislators being paid only $100 per year plus mileage.", "While describing herself as bipartisan, her pro-business votes won her a rare endorsement for a Democrat from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce when she ran for re-election in 2014. She joined the Blue Dog Coalition, the group comprising relatively conservative Democrats, and drew criticism from the left for a voting record in which she often sided with President Trump and other Republicans.\n\nMeanwhile, other forces were reshaping Arizona\u2019s political landscape. Republicans still outnumber Democrats in the state, but so do independents. Arizona, despite the bluster of some of its Republican activists, is the state that has been home to Republicans willing sometimes to criticize President Trump, including John McCain, the iconic senator who died over the summer at the age of 81, and Jeff Flake, who is vacating the seat won by Ms. Sinema.\n\nStill, momentum seems to be on the side of Democrats, a trend that accelerated in the closing weeks of the campaign. Since the primaries in August, for every two voters that registered as Republicans in the state, three registered as Democrats, according to the Arizona Secretary of State\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cI kind of smile when someone asks how Sinema pulled it off,\u201d said Alejandra Gomez, executive director of the Arizona Center for Empowerment, a group that supports immigrant rights and public education.\n\n\u201cI mean, we pulled it off,\u201d said Ms. Gomez, emphasizing how her group and other grass-roots organizers registered about 190,000 people to vote in Arizona ahead of this year\u2019s election. \u201cWe knocked on the doors of over a million people of color. Think about that. There\u2019s a lot of talk about signing up first-time voters but we went out and did it.\u201d\n\nMs. Gomez said that doing so sometimes resulted in tense conversations among organizers. Some expressed concern about asking people to vote for Ms. Sinema, who steadfastly refused to endorse David Garcia, the liberal Democrat who ran for governor of Arizona and lost in a landslide to the Republican incumbent, Doug Ducey.\n\nThen there was Ms. Sinema\u2019s voting record on immigration issues. She was one of only two dozen Democrats in the House who voted in favor of Kate\u2019s Law, a bill to expand maximum sentences for foreigners who re-enter the country after being deported.", "WASHINGTON \u2014 Freshman orientation for new members of Congress had barely begun when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 29-year-old darling of the progressive left and newly elected congresswoman from New York, visited Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office for the first time. She was not there to meet the House Democratic leader.\n\nShe was there to protest.\n\n\u201cThis is not about personality, this is not about rebuke, this is not about confrontation \u2014 it\u2019s about making sure that we are getting the job done,\u201d she declared, moments before she spoke to young activists who staged a sit-in to demand a Green New Deal to address climate change. Of Ms. Pelosi, she said, \u201cI think she really appreciates civic engagement.\u201d\n\nMs. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s noisy Washington debut, and her uncanny knack for grabbing the spotlight, underscores the difficulties that await Democratic leaders as they try to unify an unusually diverse incoming class. Newcomers in both parties descended on the capital Tuesday for the start of a biennial Washington rite \u2014 freshman orientation \u2014 that seems unusually freighted with seriousness in the age of President Trump.\n\nGoing to Congress is typically like going to college. Newcomers make new friends, look for housing, pick up new cellphones (this year, they are also being issued iPads) and take pictures for their temporary ID badges, to be replaced by House pins once they are sworn in. They take nonpartisan seminars about the nuts and bolts of joining Congress \u2014 how to hire staff and set up an office. And they go to parties, lots of parties, which members of Congress prefer to call \u201creceptions.\u201d", "Amazon\u2019s New York site could also qualify for federal tax breaks under the tax law passed by Republicans late late year. That law created a program to encourage development in so-called opportunity zones, including parts of Long Island City.\n\nNew York City did not offer any special tax breaks to Amazon as part of the deal. But the company will be able to take advantage of existing city tax credits, including a program designed to encourage companies to create jobs outside the busiest parts of Manhattan. The program, open to all companies, could be worth as much as $900 million to Amazon over 12 years, on top of the state incentives.\n\nMs. Doulis, of the Citizens Budget Commission, said that credit and similar ones might have outlived their usefulness. In the 1980s and \u201990s, she said, companies were taking a risk by expanding in Queens or Brooklyn, and tax breaks provided an important inducement. But today, Long Island City is a rapidly developing neighborhood full of hip bars and luxury apartment complexes.\n\n\u201cThat neighborhood was very different 25 years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a very different world now.\u201d\n\nStill, Ms. Doulis said Amazon\u2019s arrival was a major coup for the city, which has been trying to establish itself as a tech hub to rival Boston, Seattle and even Silicon Valley. Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday said Amazon\u2019s decision was a vindication of that strategy, which the mayor said would benefit all New Yorkers.\n\nTom Stringer, who advises companies on site-selection decisions for the consulting firm BDO, said high-cost places like New York and Virginia needed to offer incentives to compete with cheaper areas. And he said the deals would pay off in the long run in jobs and tax revenues.\n\n\u201cIncentives are not subsidies,\u201d Mr. Stringer said. \u201cThey are investments.\u201d\n\nBut it isn\u2019t clear they are good investments, said Jay Shambaugh, director of the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution. In offering incentives to Amazon, he said, New York and Virginia are effectively subsidizing a big, incumbent company at the expense of local businesses and start-ups. That is especially concerning, he added, when entrepreneurship rates are falling and cities are struggling to nurture homegrown businesses.", "\u201cAs advanced as we are, we are literally down to buckets and shovels,\u201d Sergeant Kelly said.\n\nAround 15 search-and-rescue teams met in the parking lot of the local bowling alley Tuesday morning to begin their grim task, fanning out across the region, said Sgt. Steve Collins of the Butte County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\nThe search teams include many volunteers and each team was assigned an anthropologist with the expertise to distinguish human from animal remains.\n\nTeams were also accompanied by Cal Fire firefighters who were called on to help with specific tasks: removing heavy debris, entering particularly dangerous areas, or using thermal imaging technology to determine if a home was still too hot to enter.\n\nAmong the specialists called on to assist in the identification of victims is Jim Wood, an expert in forensic odontology, the use of dental records to match teeth found in the ashes.\n\nMr. Wood, who is also a representative in the California State Assembly, says dental records were crucial in identifying the victims of the wine country fires last year. Officials are checking dental clinics in Paradise, he said, to see how many records survived the fires.\n\n\u201cThe trick is getting the records,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn some of the identifications last year I only had two or three teeth,\u201d Mr. Wood said. \u201cThey are extremely fragile and that becomes another part of the challenge.\u201d\n\nMr. Wood said hip replacements and other implanted medical devices resilient to fire were also helpful in identifying victims in last year\u2019s fires.", "In the midterms, Mr. Collins\u2019s Democratic opponent was Nate McMurray, the supervisor of my small town, Grand Island. I know Nate, but then everyone here knows Nate. Buffalo is the kind of place where we expect to bump into our politicians and professional athletes in the grocery store, and we see nothing rude in stopping them to talk about the game last Sunday. This is especially true on Grand Island.\n\nDespite this, Chris Collins said I should fear Nate \u2014 because he speaks Korean. A Collins campaign ad that ran just days before the election shows a video of Mr. McMurray bowing and speaking in Korean in slow motion. Beneath him runs a subtitle warning that Mr. McMurray \u201cworked to send jobs to China and Korea.\u201d In the background an image of Kim Jong-un, the North Korean dictator, flashes by. \u201cYou can take Nate McMurray at his word,\u201d warns the ad. His Korean word.\n\nYet Mr. McMurray, who is married to a Korean woman, never said anything in the video about jobs, and there is no evidence he ever \u201cworked to send\u201d American jobs overseas. He posted the video himself on YouTube in June as a gesture of international good will before President Trump\u2019s nuclear summit with Mr. Kim.\n\nMr. Collins was implicitly attacking Mr. McMurray\u2019s Korean wife and his Korean-speaking children. That\u2019s not how things normally work on Grand Island. \u201cBig island, small town\u201d goes the saying. It\u2019s Republican in a keep-my-taxes-low sort of way. Mr. McMurray won his supervisor position by only 14 votes, but in a race where the worst high jinks involved stealing opponent\u2019s lawn signs. (Disclosure: my wife, Jessica Castner, while not a paid member of his staff, has been Mr. McMurray\u2019s science adviser for environmental issues.)\n\nA charismatic campaigner, Mr. McMurray crisscrossed the district and likely met many of the people who voted for him. Mr. Collins dropped out of the race after being indicted, then got back in, did almost no campaigning, spoke to only one or two friendly members of the news media, has never held a town hall and has sworn he never will. He\u2019s not around to stop at the grocery store.\n\nYet he appears to have won in this district that cast 59 percent of its votes for Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nOur country\u2019s tribalism was on full display in the 27th, with party loyalty, or Trump loyalty, apparently overcoming consideration of the quality and character of the individual candidates. Some of his critics say that Mr. Collins was always a corrupt, casual racist, that Donald Trump merely unleashed what was always inside. I don\u2019t know. All I do know is that I don\u2019t recognize the former country executive, or his party at all.\n\nBrian Castner is the author of, most recently, \u201cDisappointment River: Finding and Losing the Northwest Passage.\u201d\n\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.", "Time and Donald Trump do interesting things to a man.\n\nThey make Al Gore glitter.\n\nIt\u2019s almost impossible not to be thinking of Gore this week, with the words \u201cFlorida\u201d and \u201crecount\u201d so prominent in the news, and it\u2019s hard not to credit him with virtues absent in Trump and increasingly rare in politics these days.\n\nGrace in defeat, for one.

Mr. Trump apparently believed that American sanctions, plus his threats (\u201cfire and fury\u201d) and his irresistible persona, had driven Mr. Kim to abandon his nuclear aspirations. Mr. Kim apparently believed that approaching the capacity to strike the United States had compelled Mr. Trump to agree to lift sanctions in exchange for a gradual stand-down of the North\u2019s program.\n\nPyongyang now seems to have understood its error. Mr. Kim\u2019s envoy skipped a scheduled meeting with Mr. Pompeo last week, and Mr. Trump\u2019s special envoy for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, has yet to hold talks with his designated North Korean counterpart, Choe Son-hui, more than two months since his appointment . Recent statements from North Korea speak of resuming work on its nuclear program unless sanctions are lifted. The Trump administration continues to demand complete denuclearization before any sanctions are lifted. In other words, virtually nothing has changed.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump? He appears still happily convinced that love had conquered all. \u201cWe fully know about the sites being discussed, nothing new \u2014 and nothing happening out of the normal,\u201d he said on Twitter on Tuesday. \u201cJust more Fake News.

Reaching lengths of up to 10 feet, the razor-toothed monitor lizards hunt deer in packs and have even attacked humans on occasion. But actually, they are real homebodies, according to a study published Wednesday in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.\n\nA decade of observations at 10 sites on four islands has revealed that the dragons essentially never leave the valley where they were born. It\u2019s not that they can\u2019t. They are capable of traveling many miles and through rough terrain, if necessary.

It is less than a mile from the T stop and commuter rail at Porter Square, in Cambridge, and slightly more than a mile from Harvard Square.

Through services like Flickr, then Facebook and Instagram, we tried to curate our images by getting others to do it for us. The best photos of you were the ones that were ranked highly in your social feed; the worst were the ones you didn\u2019t post.\n\nBut social media created another set of problems \u2014 there was a fear of missing out, a sense of performative anxiety, loneliness and an erosion of privacy. \u201cThere was a sense in which because everything was public, young people had to constantly curate the idea of themselves in public,\u201d said Mr. Hand.\n\nGoogle, too, tried to play the social photo game. The earliest incarnation of Google Photos was part of Google Plus, the search company\u2019s ill-fated, just-shuttered social network. A few years ago, after realizing that social networking was not its forte, Google went back to the drawing board with Photos.\n\nIts reimagined service would do three things: Offer nearly limitless storage for your photos essentially free (you can pay more to have your images stored in higher-resolution sizes). It put them in the cloud, so they could be accessed anywhere. And, crucially, Photos would lean on Google\u2019s famed A.I. to address what it saw as the key problem of the smartphone era \u2014 the fact that we all take photos but rarely look at them.\n\n\u201cWe noticed that you would never relive or reminisce about any of these moments,\u201d said Anil Sabharwal, the Google vice president who led the team that built Photos, and still runs it. \u201cYou would go on this beautiful vacation, you\u2019d take hundreds of beautiful photos, years would pass, and you would never look at any of them.\u201d\n\nWhen it started in 2015, Google Photos brought immediate relief. For instance, face recognition made sharing pictures automatic. Now, when I take a photo of my kids, Google recognizes them and shares those photos with my wife; her photos are shared with me. Incredibly, instantly, without thinking, we each have a complete collection of the children\u2019s photos, and any anxiety about keeping them secure has vanished.", "A flamboyant Malaysian financier who once hosted Hollywood parties and lavished gifts on models is on a new kind of charm offensive.\n\nThe financier, Jho Low, is facing charges in a multibillion-dollar scandal that has rocked politics in Asia and shaken a premier Wall Street bank. And the legal team supporting him has spent more than $1.1 million over the past seven months to help improve his reputation, according to government filings. These sophisticated services include round-the-clock crisis P.R. response, efforts to shape internet search results, and a website with international reports and legal filings intended to bolster his side of story.\n\nThe filings provide a glimpse inside a growing industry called litigation communications, which caters to wealthy people and corporations ensnared in international legal fights. The filings themselves are something of a rarity \u2014 and a suggestion that such crisis managers are growing cautious as federal prosecutors cast a critical eye on foreign lobbying and influence campaigns.\n\n\n\nThe campaign on behalf of Mr. Low, carried out by two high-powered law firms, is described in filings submitted last month to the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA.

Every week, nine N.F.L. games are televised in Mexico, and the number of people who have paid for the league\u2019s internet broadcast package has increased by 40 percent in the past year.

If it had chosen to place a second hub in one of the less stereotypically \u201ccoastal elite\u201d options on its list (or split between two of them \u2014 say, Columbus and Raleigh), Amazon could inject new energy, diversity and opportunity into regions suffering the negative side effects of globalization.\n\nJeff Bezos could single-handedly do much to reverse the consolidation of America\u2019s urban professional class into a few cities, and thus begin to soothe some of the cultural divides.\n\nPlacing a headquarters in the D.C. area will have a negative impact on American politics. Although politics has always been dominated by the wealthy, skyrocketing real estate prices in Washington have increasingly blocked young idealists willing to work long hours for low salaries. If the gentrification of Seattle is any indication, an Amazon headquarters in D.C. will result in more stories like the one this past week about Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez being unable to afford an apartment in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nOliver Kendall\n\nWashington\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nMy mind is plagued with disappointment and genuine concern now that it has been confirmed that Long Island City will be home to Amazon\u2019s HQ2 \u2014 or is it HQ1.5?

Over the years, I watched rents skyrocket, mom-and-pop shops convert into overpriced condos, and my town transform into a place that began to look like everywhere else.", "To the Editor:\n\nRe \u201cAmid Accounts of Close Calls, Fires\u2019 Toll Rises\u201d (front page, Nov. 13):\n\nAlongside the poignant scenes of devastated California homeowners picking through the remains of their burned-out homes, we are reminded by Gov. Jerry Brown that, in many ways, our response to global warming is a deeply moral issue.\n\nHe contends that those who deny that it is climate change that makes wildfires more frequent and intense are contributing to the tragedies of lost lives and burned-out communities. Among those, of course, is our president, who has expressed doubts about global warming. Little wonder he ignorantly blames forest management for this tragedy.\n\nEvery day that we deny or ignore the fact that climate change is real and caused by burning coal, oil and gas, and continue to do nothing about it, condemns our children and future generations to the horrors of a climate out of control.\n\nBob Taylor\n\nNewport Beach, Calif.", "For years, insect populations have been dropping worldwide without a clear explanation. A new paper suggests male infertility is at least one factor behind that decline, as warmer-than-usual temperatures take a disproportionate toll on males of some insect species.\n\nAfter a lab-simulated heat wave, researchers from England\u2019s University of East Anglia found that male flour beetles produced vastly less sperm. But they also found that the damage wasn\u2019t confined to the males. Sperm inside a female\u2019s reproductive tract became less viable and the sons of the males that endured the hotter temperature became less fertile, too.\n\nMatt Gage, an evolutionary ecologist who led the work published Tuesday in Nature Communications, said he was surprised by the findings, and by how quickly male fertility plummeted.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nIt\u2019s long been known that heat can affect sperm quality in mammals. \u201cThere\u2019s a good reason the testes are outside the body,\u201d noted Dr. Gage, adding that this keeps the sperm 6 to 10 degrees cooler than body temperature.", "To the Editor:\n\nRe \u201cCave Contains World\u2019s Oldest Figurative Art, Dating Back Over 40,000 Years\u201d (news article, Nov. 8):\n\nAs the political sniping continues after the midterms and the Democrats anoint themselves saviors of the country they claim is broken, it is a welcome distraction to read about an era long past and the enthusiasts who investigate it.\n\nUsing a new dating method that measures the deterioration of minerals in a clear cave wall coating with the lovely name of flowstone , archaeologists can say that certain hand stencils and drawings of animals found in mountain caves in Borneo are at least 40,000 years old.\n\nAs these hunter-gatherers settled and their populations grew, it is thought that they may have used art to communicate, teach and build community. Today many schools view arts education as outside of core skill requirements and are cutting it from the curriculum.\n\nThe discoveries in Borneo remind us that artistic expression has always been an essential part of what it means to be human.", "For Amazon, Crystal City was an obvious choice.\n\nWith plenty of vacant properties and potential for redevelopment, the area gives the internet retailer a perch to sell more cloud storage services to the Department of Defense and other government agencies nearby. It is also minutes from Reagan National Airport, with many direct flights to Amazon\u2019s main headquarters in Seattle. The neighborhood is walkable and just a few subway stops from downtown Washington and Capitol Hill. The area also has one of the country\u2019s best-educated work forces, and the public school systems rank high.\n\nAmazon had announced 14 months ago that it would take bids from North American cities to create a second headquarters with 50,000 jobs, but if Virginians were disappointed with getting only half of what they bargained for on Tuesday, they didn\u2019t show it.\n\n\u201cFirst thing I want to say is \u2018Wow!\u2019\u201d Brian Ball, Virginia\u2019s secretary of commerce and trade, exclaimed into the mic at the news conference. The audience applauded and shouted \u201cWoo!\u201d in affirmation.\n\nMr. Northam said Virginia had to adjust some of its incentives with the announcement of only 25,000 jobs, but he wouldn\u2019t elaborate.\n\nSenator Mark Warner of Virginia also spent the day on a media tour, promoting the ripple effects of Crystal City\u2019s partnership with Amazon. In a morning interview with Yahoo, he pumped his fists in the air and said the benefits of Amazon\u2019s new offices would stretch into rural areas of the state.\n\n\u201cThis is really a win for the whole region,\u201d Mr. Warner, a Democrat, said in the interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not just immediate jobs but the enormous amount of spinoffs and what I think that will do to spur entrepreneurial activity.\u201d\n\nCrystal City will anchor Amazon\u2019s presence in the area, but the company\u2019s offices will spill over into parts of the Pentagon City neighborhood and nearby Alexandria. Arlington and Alexandria officials branded the area as National Landing, a two-and-a-half-mile urban stretch connected by three Metro subway stations along the Potomac.", "With Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism about NATO, which he has portrayed as a club in which member countries somehow pay dues to the United States, there has been renewed interest in a more forceful European defense capability, but within NATO, not in opposition to it.\n\nThink-tanks debate the idea of European \u201cstrategic autonomy,\u201d a label American policymakers resist because it implies separation.\n\nEuropeans argue that \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d simply refers to their own capacity to collectively do small-scale military operations that NATO does not want to do. Then there are the debates about whether European defense spending would be designed to promote European military manufacturers at the expense of American ones, one of the Trump administration\u2019s criticisms of any efforts toward more European defense.\n\nA year ago, in response both to Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism and new Russian military actions in Ukraine, the Europeans created a program called Pesco, designed to promote greater efficiency among European militaries, and put more money jointly into a European defense fund to promote European research and development and equipment. But even then Ms. Merkel emphasized that these efforts should be done in coordination with both the United States and Britain.\n\nMs. Merkel is said to have been deeply moved by the weekend centennial events for World War I in France, much of it spent by the side of Mr. Macron. He has regularly supported the idea of a European army and a European intervention force, designed to handle sudden conflict outside of NATO.\n\nHer speech came after the summit meeting in Paris that displayed many of the strains between Mr. Trump and European allies. An interview given by Mr. Macron was misinterpreted by some journalists to suggest that he favored the creation of a European army to defend against Russia, China and even the United States. In fact Mr. Macron discussed the need for France to defend itself against cyber attacks and cyber espionage involving those countries.\n\nOnly later in the interview did he discuss a European army, but that was without any direct reference to competition against the United States. Instead Mr. Macron emphasized how Europe must do more for its own security, which Washington has regularly urged.", "Some undoubtedly would. But they\u2019d be cowards. Their objective should be to render him as impotent as possible.\n\nIt is also true that Flake\u2019s record is better than all but a handful of his Senate Republican colleagues. This week, he and Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, are planning to ask for a vote on legislation that protects the investigation of the special counsel, Robert Mueller.\n\nBut Flake didn\u2019t write the original legislation. Other colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee did. And it would be shocking if it went anywhere.\n\nThe truth of the matter is this: If Flake believed, all along, that Trump posed a genuine threat to democracy \u2014 that he is the least stable element on the periodic table of American presidents, with a half-life of 22 minutes and a terrifying potential to blow things up \u2014 then why did he slavishly follow the president\u2019s desires at all? Why did he ever allow ideological ends to justify republic-endangering means?\n\nIn my initial review, I did note that Flake\u2019s words wouldn\u2019t be worth much if they weren\u2019t matched by deeds. But I made this point late, at the bottom of the staircase. (Thank goodness it appeared in the headline.) I was otherwise snowed by Flake\u2019s candor. Along with lavender-scented baths, chamomile tea and barbiturates, books by politicians tend to rank among the world\u2019s most potent soporifics. His was not. He wrote of the despair he was feeling beneath the lacquered smile.\n\nBut Flake, as a sitting senator, has been in the position to do more than despair. He has been in the position to swallow his misgivings about policy and align himself with the opposition. He could have waged guerrilla warfare against Trump\u2019s agenda at decisive moments, as John McCain did by refusing to vote for the repeal of Obamacare. He could have voted against the 2017 tax bill, which should have been concerning to a deficit hawk anyhow. He could have stuck with his reservations about the Supreme Court confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, credibly accused of sexual assault, rather than deciding the F.B.I.\u2019s one-week investigation into the matter \u2014 an investigation he called for \u2014 was sufficient. (How thrilled I was he\u2019d shown some spine! And then it collapsed in a heap, like so many mah-jongg tiles.)\n\nIf you\u2019re a truly committed Never Trumper, there\u2019s a fundamental problem with selectively supporting Trump\u2019s agenda. Whenever you hand him a vote, you strengthen him. You contribute to his roster of accomplishments. The more victories he accumulates, the more reasons he has for voters to buy the same product in 2020.", "As night fell, and the fire loomed just acres away, we watched collective questions \u2014 how to prepare, what to pack, where the fire would lurch next and whether to stay \u2014 rise up and manifest in the streets: Grocery shelves emptied, gas stations overflowed and cars filled with a hodgepodge of camping gear, photo albums, cans and pets.\n\nOur neighbors left. We stayed, but got ready to leave at a moment\u2019s notice: go-bags, and what few family memorabilia would fit into my station wagon. My husband insisted on strapping bikes to the top racks in case we had to abandon the car and go on foot like many people fleeing just hours before.\n\nShivering from the November chill, my daughter and I soaked the perimeter of our home while my husband tried to clear the roof of the large chunks of ash and charred leaves falling from the sky.\n\nWe woke to complete darkness, smoke blocking out the sun and dropping Chico\u2019s temperature 30 degrees.

Mr. Kemp, the Republican, declared victory and resigned as Georgia\u2019s secretary of state so he wouldn\u2019t be responsible for overseeing the counting of votes in the race \u2014 though before he resigned he did make an unsubstantiated claim that Democrats were hacking the election.\n\nThere is a silver lining in this mess: The new secretary of state could finally fix Georgia\u2019s astoundingly insecure voting system, one of the most poorly protected in the country.\n\nThis has been a rough election for Georgians. Accusations of racism and voter suppression have abounded. An outside investigation found that more than 340,000 voter registrations had been improperly canceled by Mr. Kemp\u2019s office. A significant number were reinstated by court order, but there is no way of knowing if voter turnout would have been even higher if the Kemp purge hadn\u2019t happened.\n\nOn top of this, an indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers as part of Robert Mueller's inquiry into election interference suggests that the election system in counties in Georgia were targeted for hacking in 2016.", "\u2022 Mounting questions for Boeing over Indonesian crash.\n\nPilots said the aircraft maker didn\u2019t tell them about changes to the emergency system on its new 737 Max 8 jet, the model in the Lion Air 610 disaster that killed 189 people.\n\nInvestigators have been focused on whether the emergency system caused the accident. It\u2019s designed to automatically correct a plane\u2019s angle if it appears to be stalling. But if it malfunctions, it could send a plane into a potentially fatal nose-dive.\n\nIndonesian transportation officials have said the manual for the new Boeing model didn\u2019t contain information about the update.

Mr. Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have privately cautioned against such a move and Mr. Navarro has pushed for tariffs as a way to gain greater concessions from Europe and Japan, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nMr. Kudlow, Mr. Mnuchin and others in the administration have also been encouraging Mr. Trump to make a trade deal with China and to forgo the additional tariffs he has threatened to impose on all Chinese imports. Mr. Navarro said in his speech last week that China was not playing fair and was simply trying to get the United States to the table to improve its global image.\n\n\u201cThey want to get us to the bargaining table, sound reasonable, talk their way and have their way with us,\u201d Mr. Navarro said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington.", "After a devastating injury to Brooklyn guard Caris LeVert on Monday night, followed by an outpouring of support across the NBA, the Nets received unexpected good news: LeVert will not need foot surgery and is expected to return this season, the Nets team orthopedist said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cFortunately, tests performed this morning revealed that there are no fractures and only moderate ligament damage,\u201d Dr. Martin O\u2019Malley said. \u201cWhile the optics of this injury may have appeared to be more severe, surgery will not be required.

He began his career with \u201cEssex County Trilogy,\u201d a fictional version of his childhood upbringing. \u201cI never thought in a million years I\u2019d actually be able to write for Marvel or DC Comics,\u201d he said, though he eventually found himself working, usually as a writer, for those companies, which are primarily known for their superhero fare.\n\n\u201cBlack Hammer is my love letter to superhero comics as an indie comic,\u201d he said. The series, he said, gives him a chance to explore stories that he might not have been able to do with flagship characters, who are often weighed down by years of storytelling or merchandising concerns.\n\nThere is a seemingly endless array of comic book-based fare on screens big and small, with more on the way. One reason comics appeal to producers is the potential to exploit an existing audience, noted Monica Landers, chief executive of StoryFit, which uses data and machine learning to predict content marketability. Another reason \u201cis that there\u2019s just a lot more story in the written development,\u201d she said by email. \u201cThis means that producers have choices and can focus on the specific stories that will most resonate in this medium. For television series, this means that producers have a strong platform from which to grow and extend \u2014 like we\u2019ve seen in \u2018Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u2019\u201d", "Claude Lanzmann, who died at 92 in July, returned to material shot for his landmark film \u201cShoah\u201d (1985) several times, most recently in the riveting documentary \u201cThe Last of the Unjust\u201d (2014).\n\n\u201cShoah: Four Sisters\u201d \u2014 screened at last year\u2019s New York Film Festival, before Lanzmann\u2019s death \u2014 consists of four short features taken from interviews he shot for \u201cShoah\u201d in the 1970s, each showcasing the testimony of a different female Holocaust survivor. Their stories are as harrowing, complicated and rife with imponderables as any Lanzmann filmed. And together, collected in a form that is much less labyrinthine than \u201cShoah,\u201d they represent an ideal introduction (and capstone) to Lanzmann\u2019s project.\n\n[Read our obituary of Claude Lanzmann.]\n\nWhile the installments can be watched independently, they have a cumulative power. Their points of confluence \u2014 the deaths of family members, improbable escapes, the hardship of life in ghettos and camps \u2014 underscore the horror and, at times, the grim absurdity of surviving extermination.\n\nThe subject of the segment \u201cThe Merry Flea,\u201d Ada Lichtman, from Poland, recalls how she was forced to clean dolls taken from Jewish children to prepare them for Germans to give to their own offspring. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable, dressing dolls in a death camp,\u201d Lanzmann says to her. \u201cBut everything is unbelievable,\u201d she replies.

counseling our patients to reduce their risk of firearm injury and toward evidence-based solutions to the public health crisis that firearm injury has become.\u201d\n\nMany doctors shared a similar message to the N.R.A.: For physicians who treat gunshot victims, the topic of gun policy is absolutely \u201cin their lane.\u201d More than 35,000 people in the United States are killed in firearm-related deaths every year, according to an annual average compiled from C.D.C. data by Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group.\n\nDr. Robert Young, a New York psychiatrist who is the editor of the website for the group Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownership, said that the N.R.A.\u2019s characterization of \u201canti-gun doctors\u201d was correct. He accused doctor specialty groups of holding an anti-gun bias that trickles down into their medical journals.\n\n\u201cDoctors are not the experts on gun safety,\u201d Dr. Young, who is an N.R.A. member, said in an interview. \u201cYou have to be an experienced firearms owner and have some training to know about gun safety.

In heavily populated areas like the Bronx, it is too easy for an innocent person to be caught in crossfire or for someone to shoot into a crowd, she said.\n\nBut at a recent conference for medical professionals, Dr. Haughey heard another doctor speak about how her father, who lives in a rural area, was attacked and the police said they could not get there soon. He used his gun to keep the assailant at bay, the doctor said.\n\nDr. Haughey said she came away with a new understanding about gun ownership and the belief that the country could find middle ground between allowing guns and banning them. And to find a resolution, she said, doctors must be included.\n\n\u201cWe have a front-seat window view that the N.R.A. is trying to close and say, \u2018Ignore it,\u2019\u201d Dr. Haughey said.", "While there have been some positive trends in the opioid epidemics at the national level, including a drop in the number of overdose deaths in parts of New England, New Jersey\u2019s death rate has been rising steadily. Nearly 2,700 overdose deaths have been confirmed in the first 10 months of this year, according to data collected by the state attorney general\u2019s office. In 2017, preliminary data show that there were 2,750 overdose-related deaths.\n\nThe opioid crisis in New Jersey became the main focus of Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s final year in office and he used his national platform as a presidential candidate to repeatedly call for reforms on treating opioid addiction and prosecuting drug abusers. President Trump also named Mr. Christie as chairman of his commission on the opioid crisis. Besides suing Purdue Pharma, the Christie administration also sued Insys Therapeutics, an Arizona-based opioid manufacturer.\n\nBut the lawsuit announced by Mr. Grewal represents a new front in New Jersey\u2019s battle against the scourge of opioids, targeting a company that plays a key role in the state\u2019s economy.\n\nNew Jersey has a deep and lucrative connection with the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Often referred to as \u201cThe Medicine Chest of the World,\u201d New Jersey was once home to many major pharmaceutical manufacturers, such as Pfizer, Merck and Johnson and Johnson. And while some companies have left the state, the industry still accounts for roughly 120,000 jobs, totaling $16.5 billion in annual payroll in 2016, or 7.8 percent of the state\u2019s total wages.\n\nMr. Grewal told reporters that his office was not investigating Janssen\u2019s parent company, Johnson & Johnson, but said that additional charges could be filed. Though Janssen is one of the state\u2019s largest employers, Mr. Grewal said that did not factor into his office\u2019s decision making.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not shying away from holding folks accountable,\u201d Mr. Grewal said. \u201cIf they\u2019re culpable, we\u2019ll hold them accountable.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit is similar to other lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies, tracing the evolution of opioids from short-dosage painkillers in the early 1990s to drugs whose effects are more long term.", "BANGKOK \u2014 Boeing faced new scrutiny on Tuesday over the crash of one of its planes into the sea off Indonesia last month, as airlines, pilots and regulators sought to determine whether the company had underplayed the complexity of a new emergency system suspected of having malfunctioned on the doomed jetliner.\n\nInvestigators have been focused on whether the plane, Lion Air Flight 610, crashed because the system, which is designed to pull the plane out of a dangerous stall, activated based on inaccurate data transmitted or processed from sensors on the fuselage.\n\nThe plane plunged nose down into the sea, killing all 189 people on board. The precise cause or causes of the crash remain unclear.\n\nBoeing has been selling the model that crashed, the new 737 Max 8, as requiring little additional pilot training for airlines that already use the previous version of the plane.

He had always found the depiction of the mouse too indistinct, so he retrieved his paint brushes and set about \u201cimproving\u201d on the work of Rubens by making the hazy rodent clearer. \u201cIf that is not courage,\u201d Lord Mountbatten, the First Sea Lord, said later, \u201cI do not know what is.\u201d\n\nLack of courage was never Churchill\u2019s problem. As a young man he was mentioned in dispatches for his bravery fighting alongside the Malakand Field Force on the North-West Frontier, and subsequently he took part in the last significant cavalry charge in British history at the Battle of Omdurman in central Sudan. In middle age he served in the trenches of World War I, during which time a German high-explosive shell came in through the roof of his dugout and blew his mess orderly\u2019s head clean off. Later, as prime minister during World War II, and by now in his mid-60s, he thought nothing of visiting bomb sites during the Blitz or crossing the treacherous waters of the Atlantic to see President Roosevelt despite the very real chance of being torpedoed by German U-boats.\n\nChurchill had political courage too, not least as one of the few to oppose the appeasement of Hitler. Many had thought him a warmonger and even a traitor. \u201cI have always felt,\u201d said that scion of the Establishment, Lord Ponsonby, at the time of the Munich debate in 1938, \u201cthat in a crisis he is one of the first people who ought to be interned.\u201d Instead, when the moment of supreme crisis came in 1940, the British people turned to him for leadership.

The company\u2019s sleek device (nicknamed the iPhone of e-cigarettes) resembles a flash drive and comes with flavor pods like cr\u00e8me and mango, leading public health officials to criticize the company and others for appearing to market directly to teenagers, who are especially vulnerable to nicotine addiction.\n\nE-cigarettes were originally developed to help smokers quit by giving them a way to satisfy their nicotine cravings without the tar and deadly carcinogens that come with burning tobacco.\n\n\u201cOur intent was never to have youth use Juul,\u201d said Kevin Burns, chief executive of Juul Labs in a statement emailed to reporters. \u201cBut intent is not enough.

When I was 10, my younger sister was misdiagnosed at the local field clinic in Mandaree. She had appendicitis, and it almost ruptured and we almost lost her. Local health care providers turned her and my mom away. They would say she just had flulike symptoms and give her Tylenol and send her home.\n\nMy mom drove her to the nearest town that has a hospital \u2014 Watford City, 27 miles away \u2014 and the ambulance rushed her to the next level of care in Williston, and they had emergency surgeons.

It was scary, and I wanted to figure out how we could fix that in our community to where nobody else would have to experience that.\n\nSo from that point on, I set out to become a medical doctor. I applied and got into a summer program in seventh grade: physics, chemistry, math. It was a six-week program every summer. Then I went on to study pre-med in college. I found that I could not work with cadavers my whole senior year, so I had a life-changing decision to make [laughs].\n\nWhat were the biggest issues you focused on in your campaign?\n\nAccess to health care. I knocked over 6,500 doors, and that was the most common theme I found at the doors from voters. Another issue that came up was our education system, K-12 and higher ed, and then also property taxes. People are afraid to be thrown out on the street, to lose their homes because the property taxes continue to increase.\n\nNorth Dakota is a pretty conservative state. How do you think you won as a Democrat?\n\nI would say meeting people where they\u2019re at. Literally on their doorsteps. Most people were surprised to see a candidate at their doorstep.

The classic storytelling mode in travel writing (not just at The Times, but pretty much everywhere) is the first-person travelogue, in which someone parachutes into a location and brings back the tale of the journey. That has resulted in some wonderful writing and terrific insights into far-flung places. But it made more sense when travel was harder, when most people were never going to take that trip to Patagonia or the Australian outback, so the writer really was the reader\u2019s window into a different world.\n\nNow, people can much more easily visit places themselves, and they don\u2019t necessarily want our take on a place; they want the tools to discover it for themselves and find their own take on it.", "Smartphones have made it easy to share photos with family and friends, but the images are often ephemeral \u2014 soon buried in text strings or inboxes.

Kimchi in little tins is served with vegetable bibimbap. Mr. Park, who came to the United States when he was 25, describes his food as a blend of Korean flavors and French techniques.

This collection was assembled by William Arnett beginning in the 1980s, when little attention was paid to untrained black artists from the South working in highly inventive ways.\n\nThe Morgan, known best for old master drawings, hadn\u2019t been on Mr. Anderson\u2019s list. But after hearing the contemporary painter Chris Martin describe how the vernacular artist Purvis Young had influenced him, a Morgan curator, Isabelle Dervaux, contacted the foundation and ultimately selected 11 drawings by Young, Henry Speller and Nellie Mae Roe, among others. \u201cArtists from the mainstream are looking at this kind of art,\u201d said Ms. Dervaux, adding that the Morgan\u2019s music collection of African-American folk songs and its manuscript collection of books from the Harlem Renaissance provided context for the acquisition, which will be exhibited in 2021.\n\nThe proceeds from these transfers go toward the foundation\u2019s new program of grants. The first is funding three paid museum internships for undergraduate students of color, beginning next year, at the New Orleans Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, each of which have acquired work from Souls Grown Deep.

Some chefs show their mastery over pasta by pressing it thinner than a screen protector for an iPhone. Ms. Robbins likes hers to have body and heft, and the chew test is the most reliable way to tell when thick pasta like that is ready. You are very unlikely to get a piece that is undercooked at its core, or one that doesn\u2019t fight back enough to let you know it is still alive.\n\nYou get this just-in-between texture in the stubs of mezze rigatoni with a simple, glossy, ripe tomato sauce that\u2019s been stewed with whole garlic cloves \u2014 30 to a batch, according to the menu. You get it again in the corzetti, discs about the diameter of a Red Bull can that are pressed with a wooden stamp to give them a target pattern. In October, Misi served these ridged coins with another tomato sauce, this one barely cooked, just some Sungold tomatoes warmed until they broke open and their yellow pulp spilled out. Fresh basil, thyme and chervil were scattered over the top, as good an illustration as any of how Ms. Robbins makes her food stand out without deviating from an Italian reliance on simple, unmanipulated ingredients.\n\nBut to call Misi a pasta restaurant would be to overlook its highly impressive work with vegetables. They are the subject of the menu\u2019s other half, sneakily headlined \u201cantipasti.\u201d\n\nThis is where you will find a globe eggplant roasted until it is as soft and easy to spread as cream cheese; the cut surfaces are dressed with Calabrian chiles, and the taste of lemon juice seems to have found its way to the center of the eggplant. There are fleshy and firm chanterelles, too, lightly pickled and preserved in olive oil until they\u2019re brought to the table crisscrossed with rosemary needles. Grilled runner beans with garlic and chiles have been around lately, too, in a big heap that I would have enjoyed more if a few stringy, leathery beans had not gotten past the inspectors in the kitchen.", "Chanterelles sott\u2019olio are on the menu at Misi, Missy Robbins\u2019s new restaurant in Brooklyn. Misi serves just three kinds of food: pasta, vegetables and gelato. What more do you want, really?", "People have strong feelings about what should and should not be served at Thanksgiving, though there\u2019s one point most would agree on: There must be pie.\n\nBut if pie isn\u2019t your thing, this showstopper of a cake might be.\n\nThis impressive cake is lighter than your typically dense pumpkin cake, so it\u2019s a fitting finale to a big meal, and it\u2019s gently spiced with cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg and allspice so the pumpkin flavor everyone looks for on Thanksgiving still shines through. A smooth caramel Swiss buttercream blankets the top and sides. You could go for an elegant look, frosting the cake and drizzling caramel sauce over the top or decorate with swirls of buttercream for a homespun finish.\n\nPerhaps the best thing about this cake is that it tastes even better the day after it\u2019s made. That means you don\u2019t have to worry that it will take up precious oven space on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nBake and assemble the cake the night before, and add the caramel drizzle (if you\u2019re using it) just before serving. It\u2019s a little over the top, which makes it a perfect end to a holiday meal. And if your crowd complains that it\u2019s not Thanksgiving without pie, ask someone to bring one. Who has just one dessert on Thanksgiving anyway?", "It\u2019s ingenious. As the jelly freezes, the water in it begins to form solid ice crystals, while the gelatin, the solid food particles, the droplets of fat and the flavors are concentrated in the remaining liquid. The long gelatin molecules bond to each other to form an invisibly fine net that traps everything else in its crevices.\n\nThe refrigerator plays a key role. It keeps the net cold enough so the gelatin doesn\u2019t dissolve and the fat doesn\u2019t melt. But the ice crystals do, and as they do they wash the dissolved flavors out of the net. Meanwhile the net\u2019s crevices act like a microscopic filter, trapping particles, solid fat and other impurities. What drips out of the thawing mass is a clear, flavorful liquid.\n\nThe idea of clarifying gelatin-rich meat stocks in the cold originated with a German food technologist, Prof. Gerd Kl\u00f6ck of the Hochschule Bremen, who spread the word at a 2004 meeting of Inicon, a European consortium for culinary innovation. In early 2005 the New York chef Wylie Dufresne saw a freeze-clarified venison stock in the kitchen of the Fat Duck in England, and immediately thought of a way to take the technique one giant step further: adding gelatin to flavorful liquids that don\u2019t already contain it. He soon succeeded in making a crystal-clear carrot juice.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe took the technique back to his Manhattan restaurant, WD-50, where as he recently recalled, \u201cI went crazy with it.\u201d The possibilities were endless.\n\nMr. Dufresne now has at least two gelatin-clarified consomm\u00e9s on his menu at all times. Currently he serves seared scallops in an essence of clams and smoked grapes, and lamb loin with an elixir of pretzels. At Blackbird in Chicago, Mike Sheerin, the chef de cuisine and a WD-50 alumnus, serves pork belly in a consomm\u00e9 that he makes from his mother\u2019s recipe for barbecue sauce.\n\nA blog called Ideas in Food (ideasinfood.typepad.com), written by two chefs, H. Alexander Talbot and Aki Kamozawa, is sprinkled with suggestions for an impressive variety of gelatin-clarified consomm\u00e9s including Parmesan and Roquefort, foie gras, olive oil, caramelized banana, ranch dressing, butter pecan, kimchi, pumpernickel and baked potato \u201cwith all the fixings.\u201d Mr. Talbot likes to keep consomm\u00e9s handy in the freezer, like one he brews from brown butter, soy sauce and Tabasco.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Artichokes cooked in horseradish consomm\u00e9 are remarkable.\u201d\n\nAt Jean Georges on Central Park West, the executive pastry chef, Johnny Iuzzini, makes a strawberry soda as part of his strawberry dessert course. \u201cI clarify a pur\u00e9e of strawberries and the water I cook them in and get a beautifully clear red liquid with a bright, fresh flavor,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to add any sugar. I carbonate it and top it with a birch-beer foam and diced strawberries.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Iuzzini also uses the technique to make an even more surprising dish for his chocolate course. He makes separate \u201cstocks\u201d of dark and white chocolate by cooking them in water, then clarifies them into fat-free liquids, one brown and one colorless. He then adds sugars and xanthan gum, a thickener, to give the two liquids different densities and a slight cohesiveness. This allows him to build a two-story drink, a layer of cold white chocolate consomm\u00e9 riding on a base of hot dark chocolate consomm\u00e9.\n\nSo far I\u2019ve used gelatin clarification to make tomato, Parmesan and chicken consomm\u00e9s. The flavors are so distinct and appealing that I\u2019ve been content just to sip them straight, alone or mixed with one other.\n\nInterestingly, fans of the new consomm\u00e9s differ about the best way to make the original. Mr. Dufresne likes to freeze and thaw his beef stock to remove the gelatin and avoid the stickiness that develops when the stock is reduced. Instead, he gives his consomm\u00e9 a slight viscosity by adding xanthan gum.\n\nBy contrast, David Kinch of Manresa in Los Gatos, Calif., serves many imaginative consomm\u00e9s, but draws the line at modifying the classic meat version. \u201cTo my hopelessly romantic mind,\u201d he said, \u201cif you remove all the gelatin, you remove the seamless integration of flavor and consistency that you create by carefully cooking the stock in the first place.\u201d\n\nThey both sound good to me.", "Robert Henry Lawrence Jr. never made it on a space mission. The first African-American to train as an astronaut with NASA, he died in a supersonic jet crash in 1967, at the age of 32. But the artist Tavares Strachan is getting ready to send the astronaut into space in a manner, to honor his legacy.\n\nMr. Strachan has made an unusual satellite in the form of a 24-karat gold urn featuring a bust of the astronaut, in a high-tech black frame, to be launched from a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket currently scheduled to go up on Monday. Mr. Strachan calls his satellite \u201cEnoch\u201d after the biblical figure \u201cwho was able to forgo death,\u201d he said.

In an early poem called \u201cHis Hands,\u201d a man returns from the docks and from working crab traps for his family\u2019s supper, and we read:\n\nPutting her hands to his, she pulls him in,\n\nsets him by the stove. Slowly, she rubs oil\n\ninto his cracked palms, drawing out soreness\n\nfrom the swells, removing splinters, taking\n\nwhatever his hands will give.\n\nThe blues in a person\u2019s life tend to settle in, the critic Albert Murray wrote, like bad weather. Weather and trouble walk hand in hand in Trethewey\u2019s work.\n\nHer men and women have been through the devastation of Hurricane Camille in 1969 and, in her later poems, Katrina. They scan the skies, fearful of being sent back to another FEMA trailer of the human soul. (In 2010, Trethewey published a short memoir called \u201cBeyond Katrina: A Meditation on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.\u201d It was a missed opportunity, a sometimes vivid book marred, oddly, by stilted academic language.)", "All of the objects stored at these facilities are insured by their owners, and insurance companies \u201care not required to report to the F.B.I. or to Interpol\u201d if a policyholder is insuring a stolen object, Mr. Wittman said. \u201cThey have no law enforcement purview,\u201d he added.\n\nBut insurers do have a say in how many pieces of art are stored in one site, a factor in the growth in the number of art storage facilities.\n\n\u201cAn insurance company may find itself out of capacity at a particular storage site where there is several billion dollars in insured art at the location,\u201d said Steven Pincus, who leads the national fine art practice at DeWitt Stern, an insurance brokerage firm based in Manhattan.

Collectors who are having their homes remodeled or who are buying artworks for a home yet to be built may store objects while awaiting completion. Or they may just rotate works on display in their homes with items in storage.

He spoke of a pheasant noodle soup that he makes, and the jalape\u00f1o peppers he grows and puts in the soup to give it a kick. Then the conversation turned:\n\nMr. King: \u201cI guess I\u2019m going to have to go and get some dirt from Mexico to grow the next batch.\u201d\n\nHe and the audience laugh together.\n\nAudience member: \u201cTrust me, it\u2019s on its way.\u201d\n\nMr. King: \u201cWell, yeah, there\u2019s plenty of dirt, it\u2019s coming from the West Coast, too. And a lot of other places, besides. This is the most dirt we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nThe congressman quickly pivoted to another subject, saying that the event wasn\u2019t supposed to start yet. But I wrote about the most interesting part of the event in a piece on Election Day: \u201cWhat began as a story about his pheasant hunting trip, turned into, what seems, a veiled jab at Mexicans \u2014 as understood and promoted by his audience \u2014 innuendo about Mexicans or Mexican Americans as \u2018dirt.\u2019\u201d\n\nJeff King called my editor in chief at The Weekly Standard, Stephen F.

I\u2019m obese but not morbidly so. I walk at least seven miles a day, I work out three times a week, and I try to control my eating. In spite of this, I can\u2019t seem to lose weight. Though I understand that women bear the brunt of society\u2019s fat shaming, I\u2019ve been a victim of it too. From my mom who has always told me that I need to lose weight in order to attract a woman, to the movies where the fat guy has to work out and become fit and thin to get the girl, to normal weight men who say derogatory things about their heavier peers (like me). I\u2019ve never had a romantic relationship. In fact, I haven\u2019t even pursued one because I believe no one will want me because I\u2019m heavy. I have depression and anxiety as well. What advice do you have for me and other men who are struggling with their weight?\n\nStruggling\n\nCheryl Strayed: Your weight isn\u2019t the problem, Struggling. The problem is the culture that shames you because you have the body you do. Though progress has been made on this front thanks to the body positivity movement, the cultural values regarding which bodies are ideal and which are not are deeply embedded in our society. Given the stigma associated with having a larger body, it\u2019s no surprise you feel the shame, despair and self-loathing that you do.\n\nIt\u2019s a reasonable response to the universally negative messages you\u2019ve received \u2014 as you note \u2014 at every turn. The good news is this: You have the power to reject those values and revise those messages. Indeed, by creating new values, you\u2019ll reveal the old ones to be the lies that they are. You don\u2019t have to be thin to attract a woman. You are worthy of love, no matter your body shape. You deserve to be treated with kindness and respect by your peers at any weight. I know this to be true. The work you have ahead of you is to find a way to know it too.\n\nSteve Almond: The first thing I want to do is to apologize to my beloved twin brother, Mike, whose weight I mocked all throughout our childhood. I did this because I felt terrible about my own body, as most boys do, and I projected that contempt onto him. Most of the mockery dished out in this world arises from a bottomless pit of self-loathing. Keep that in mind, Struggling: Anyone who criticizes your weight is doing so because they don\u2019t like themselves.", "How does the church hope to influence the wider culture when pastors are ignored by many of its own flock?\n\nAt this dark crossroads for the Catholic Church, there is an opportunity for Pope Francis and the bishops to take a fresh look at the church and begin a prayerful discernment about the limits of patriarchy, human rights for L.G.B.T. people and the exclusion of women from the clergy. These will be uncomfortable but necessary topics to explore if the Catholic Church wants an era of renewal and its leaders hope to reclaim the ability to speak more persuasively to a diverse public square.\n\nThe final report from a recently concluded monthlong meeting at the Vatican that brought together young Catholics and hundreds of bishops from around the world acknowledged the need for a broader conversation about the church\u2019s teachings on sexuality. There are questions, the report noted, \u201crelated to the body, to affectivity and to sexuality that require a deeper anthropological, theological, and pastoral exploration.\u201d While conservative bishops such as Archbishop Charles Chaput of Philadelphia led the charge to make sure the descriptor \u201cL.G.B.T.\u201d was not included in a final report \u2014 a pre-synod working document used the term for the first time in Vatican history \u2014 that subtle but significant opening is an invitation for a long-overdue conversation.\n\nChurch teaching isn\u2019t set by a poll or the shifting winds of popular opinion. At the same time, the church is not a static institution. Doctrine does change and develop. The Second Vatican Council met from 1962 until 1965, a time when bishops opened the windows of the church to the modern world. The council brought historic changes in the way Catholicism understood democracy, the Jewish faith, the role of lay Catholics, interfaith dialogue and liturgy.\n\nThese reforms were intensely debated at the time and still divide many Catholics. When Pope Paul VI affirmed the church\u2019s ban on birth control a few years after the council ended \u2014 ignoring the advice of his own commission made up of lay leaders, bishops, theologians and priests \u2014 the decision provoked widespread backlash from leading figures at Catholic universities. Even some brave clergymen spoke out in protest. Most faithful Catholics just ignored the teaching.\n\nThe question isn\u2019t whether the church should stay the same or change. Paradoxically, the church has always done both. The more essential question is whether a 2,000-year-old institution that thinks in centuries can once again stand with a foot firmly planted in the best of its tradition while stepping into the future renewed and relevant to a new generation.\n\nJohn Gehring, the Catholic program director at Faith in Public Life, is the author of \u201cThe Francis Effect: A Radical Pope\u2019s Challenge to the American Catholic Church.\u201d\n\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.", "PARADISE, Calif. \u2014 Search teams were scouring the devastated town of Paradise on Tuesday with the grim expectation of finding more bodies in the aftermath of the deadliest wildfire in California history.\n\nFinding remains is a painstaking process that is often guided by cadaver dogs after an intense fire like the one that struck Paradise and surrounding areas, where at least 48 people have been killed, about 200 are still missing and much is reduced to ashes.

The town, also known as Boykin, sits in a bend of the Alabama River and was settled by freed slaves. Supported by New Deal programs, Gee\u2019s Bend led the region in black property ownership, and like Selma to the north, was instrumental in the fight for voting rights. The quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend reflect a collective history and deep sense of place. And they register the bold individual voices of the women who made them.\n\nI was invited to Gee\u2019s Bend for the first time by a friend and collaborator, the Alabama-born artist and musician Lonnie Holley. I had made a short documentary about Lonnie and his artistic process, and he introduced me to two of the community\u2019s acclaimed quilters, Mary Lee Bendolph and her daughter Essie Pettway.\n\nThe tradition of quilting in the region is passed from mother to daughter and predates the formation of the community itself. Mary Lee taught Essie and she was taught by her mother, Aolar Mosely. It is a practice that in years past was collective, but now is more solitary. Most people here grew up watching their mothers, aunts or grandmothers quilt. It is a part of the fabric of a community.\n\nI went to Gee\u2019s Bend with a deep curiosity about the lives and inspirations of these extraordinary artists, whose works hang in museums around the country, including the Whitney and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. I came to listen. To hear what it has meant to raise children, care for parents, work full time, farm and take the time to dedicate to making something beautiful for themselves, their families and their community. When I spoke with the women in the film, they articulated the joys of their lives as well as the struggles, both systemic and individual. And above all else, Mary Lee Bendolph, Essie Pettway, China Pettway, Rita Mae Pettway and Lucy Mingo emphasized an overarching theme of love \u2014 familial love, love of God, and self-love. It is the last thing that Essie told me when we spoke recently: \u201cPeople are not really expressing enough love anymore. It\u2019s at the center of what we do.\u201d\n\nMaris Curran is a Los Angeles-based filmmaker whose work has shown at MoMA, TIFF and Berlinale, among other international film festivals.", "If you\u2019re a true Marvel Cinematic Universe nerd, the second installment in the \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d series contains a tiny if crucial seed of information about Lee\u2019s Marvel cameos over the years.

To land that deal, cities offered billions in tax breaks and incentives. According to the announcement, the company could score more than $2 billion in tax incentives from the two new sites.\n\nIn the end, only Amazon and other corporations won that war. By pitting cities against one another, Amazon created a frenzy of ever more lavish and outlandish offers.

CNN also asserted that the administration had violated Mr. Acosta\u2019s due process rights guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment when it revoked his credentials without warning.\n\nMr. Acosta, who has frequently clashed with Mr. Trump, angered the president at a formal news conference last week with questions about immigration and the special counsel\u2019s investigation. The CNN correspondent would not give up the microphone after Mr. Trump tried to move on to another reporter.\n\nHours later, the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, announced that the administration had removed Mr. Acosta\u2019s credentials, which allowed him access to the White House grounds. The administration falsely claimed that Mr. Acosta had placed his hands on a White House intern who had tried to take his microphone away during the news conference.", "In targeting Mr. Macron on Tuesday, Mr. Trump extended his complaints to French wine. \u201cOn Trade, France makes excellent wine, but so does the U.S.,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France, and charges big Tariffs, whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines, and charges very small Tariffs.

The adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in keeping with office policy, said no one said it was an army against the United States. Instead, the idea was aligned with Mr. Trump\u2019s wishes that Europe bear more of the burden for its own defense.\n\nThe attack on Mr. Macron came on the third anniversary of a string of devastating terrorist attacks in Paris that left 130 dead and more than 600 wounded, timing that was perceived as insensitive on the part of the American president.\n\n\u201cWe are already great, especially on november 13th,\u201d wrote Hugo Cl\u00e9ment, a journalist for the website Konbini News. \u201cGo back to your room and give the phone to an adult.\u201d\n\nIt was not the first time that Mr. Trump had offended France with remarks on the Nov. 13 attacks, which were carried out by a team of Islamic State gunmen at the Bataclan concert hall, in cafes and bars in Paris, and at a soccer stadium in the northern suburb of St.-Denis.\n\nIn 2015, before he became president, Mr. Trump was criticized for suggesting that the attacks would have turned out differently if Paris had looser gun regulations.

In a 56-page ruling, the three justices said Asia Bibi, a farmworker in her early 50s, was the victim of mob justice aroused by unsubstantiated claims of what she said about the Prophet Muhammad in an exchange with women angry that she had sipped water from a cup used by Muslims.\n\nThough the trial was a farce, overturning it took courage. In 2011, the governor of Punjab Province, Salman Taseer, who had campaigned for Ms. Bibi\u2019s release and for changes in the blasphemy laws, was shot and killed by his bodyguard. Two months later, the minister of minorities, the sole Christian in the Pakistani government, who had also called for the changes, was killed. The announcement of the Supreme Court ruling on Oct. 31 set off protests across Pakistan and a warning from Islamist firebrands that the justices were risking death. Ms. Bibi has been in hiding since her release and may have to flee Pakistan.\n\nBut this is not a story about the triumph of tolerance over antiquated law. Ms. Bibi was freed not because the court found that the blasphemy law violated her rights or was in any other way inherently wrong, but because the trial was flawed. Blasphemy, broadly defined as speaking insultingly about God or religion, remains a capital crime in Pakistan and illegal in many other lands, in the East and the West.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, about a quarter of all countries had anti-blasphemy laws or policies as of 2014, and more than a tenth have laws or policies against apostasy, or renouncing a religious belief. That does not mean people in the West risk being imprisoned for taking the Lord\u2019s name in vain. In many countries, like Canada, old laws remain on the books simply because nobody has bothered to get them off \u2014 as the Irish did last month when they voted in a referendum to scrap their blasphemy laws. In the United States, six states still have old blasphemy laws, but no case would conceivably survive against the First Amendment.", "MEXICO CITY \u2014 Time seems to have stopped inside cell number six of Barrientos state prison, where Daniel Garc\u00eda has been held for more than 16 years without a verdict.\n\nHis distorted perception of time became clear more than a decade ago, when he sent his two daughters a dollhouse as a gift, seemingly unaware that they had grown into adults since 2002, when he was accused of murder and locked up.\n\nMr. Garc\u00eda is caught in the legal trappings of Mexico\u2019s old judicial system, which allowed those accused of crimes ranging from murder to minor offenses to be held indefinitely as their cases dragged on for years.\n\nThe Mexican government does not keep track of the average time that suspects like Mr. Garc\u00eda are kept in pretrial detention.

Soon after, documents were exchanged, and re-exchanged, ironing out details of a package worth more than a billion dollars in tax incentives and state grants. The politicians even agreed to a plan to circumvent the City Council to prevent future roadblocks.\n\nThe deal for the Queens development, in Long Island City, was announced on Tuesday, after Amazon concluded a 14-month, countrywide search for a location for a second headquarters for some 50,000 well-paid tech workers.

Amazon said the new developments, both to be called headquarters, would require $5 billion in construction and other investments.", "The Sun Belt is looking purple\n\nThe texture of the midterm results has changed most starkly over the last week in the West, as slow-counting states like Arizona and California have tallied their ballots. Democrats have captured Republican-held Senate seats in Nevada and Arizona, partially offsetting their losses in the heavily white, conservative states where Republicans unseated Democratic senators.\n\nAnd in California, what looked like a night of incremental Democratic gains has turned into a slow-motion rout for the G.O.P. Republicans are on track to lose between four and seven seats there, chiefly in the suburbs of Southern California, where even Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a 30-year incumbent, went down in defeat.\n\nFurther down the ballot, there were signs of Democratic gains in historically Republican parts of the Southwest: In Arizona, where Republicans have dominated state politics, Democrats also captured the office of education superintendent, and a second important statewide election \u2014 for secretary of state \u2014 was still too close to call a week into the count. In Nevada, where Democrats had not won a governor\u2019s race since 1994, they captured the governorship and the offices of lieutenant governor, attorney general, state treasurer and state controller.\n\nIn Texas, Democrats gained at least a dozen seats in the Statehouse and, despite partisan gerrymandering, picked up two congressional seats. Five Republican congressional candidates there who were strongly favored to win ultimately prevailed with less than 52 percent of the vote.\n\nTexas and Arizona are unlikely to be blue states anytime soon, but after years of tilting at the Southwest with little to show for it, Democrats saw real signs that the region is becoming a battleground.\n\nGrant Woods, a former Republican state attorney general in Arizona who recently registered as a Democrat, said Mr. Trump and the Republican Party had moved too far right for voters in the Southwest. Mr. Woods, who is considering a run for Senate in 2020, said the midterm results were encouraging.", "Not so many years ago, I was hardly an outlier.

Even in a hyperpartisan world, you still need reasons for traditional conservatives like myself to show up. It\u2019s got to be more than the blue team is bad.\n\nOne of the underpinnings of the Republican Party has long been financial responsibility, but here, again, the party has drifted. The president has done very little to trim the size of the federal government or entitlement spending, even as he asks for more money for corn farmers hit by his tariffs.

A White House spokesman did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nMr. Kelly has often defended Ms. Nielsen to the president, and protected her from other cabinet members when she was under attack from them.\n\nAmong some of Mr. Trump\u2019s allies, his views and treatment of Ms. Nielsen have been characterized as unfair. The president has derided her previous service in the George W. Bush administration and questioned her loyalty.

In recent years, the university has dealt with a series of sexual assault and harassment episodes involving students and faculty members, which have prompted a state audit and new campus policies. Now, the university is once again in the national conversation, and the focus this time is on a relatively new and lucrative academic program.\n\nMr. Liu, who has denied wrongdoing, was in Minnesota for a global business program, aimed at Asian executives, that is on track to generate over $10 million in tuition for the school since starting last year.

That\u2019s according to a letter sent by Facebook to Senator Ron Wyden, which the Oregon Democrat later shared with the NYT.\n\nAn F.T.C. consent decree says that Facebook is supposed to monitor those data-sharing arrangements. What actually happened, according to Nicholas Confessore, Michael LaForgia and Gabriel J.X. Dance of the NYT:\n\nWhen a team from PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted the initial F.T.C.-mandated assessment in 2013, it tested Facebook\u2019s partnerships with Microsoft and Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry handset. In both cases, PricewaterhouseCoopers found only \u201climited evidence\u201d that Facebook had monitored or checked its partners\u2019 compliance with its data use policies.

What is real? What is untrue? Why is everyone so creepy and annoying?\n\nAnd how frighteningly relevant the works of that most curmudgeonly of British playwrights suddenly feel given the state of the world, as evidenced by a celebration here of the more obscure works of Pinter, who could turn family dysfunction into squirm-in-your-seat hysteria, and loneliness and despair into the worst nightmare of a theater full of well-heeled couples.\n\nAll 20 of his one-acts, and a few poems and sketches thrown in to test your threshold for long and awkward pauses, are being performed through Feb. 23 under the title \u201cPinter at the Pinter\u201d at the quaint West End theater renamed in 2011 for the playwright, who died in December 2008.

Mr. Lind may have only fantasized about mass death as a comeuppance for cultural Marxists, but others have acted on it: In his 1,500-page manifesto, the Norwegian far-rightist Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in 2011, invoked \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d repeatedly. \u201cIt wants to change behavior, thought, even the words we use,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo a significant extent, it already has.\u201d\n\nAccording to their delirious foes, \u201ccultural Marxists\u201d are an unholy alliance of abortionists, feminists, globalists, homosexuals, intellectuals and socialists who have translated the far left\u2019s old campaign to take away people\u2019s privileges from \u201cclass struggle\u201d into \u201cidentity politics\u201d and multiculturalism. Before he executes the professors, the protagonist of Mr. Lind\u2019s novel expounds on his theory to their faces: \u201cClassical Marxists, where they obtained power, expropriated the bourgeoisie and gave their property to the state,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere you obtained power, you expropriated the rights of white men and gave special privileges to feminists, blacks, gays, and the like.\u201d It is on the basis of this parallel that the novel justifies carnage against the \u201cenemies of Christendom\u201d as an act showing that \u201cWestern culture\u201d is \u201crecovering its will.\u201d\n\nSome Marxists, like the Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci and his intellectual heirs, tried to understand how the class rule they criticized worked through cultural domination. And today, it\u2019s true that on campus and off, many people are directing their ire at the advantages that white males have historically enjoyed. But neither the defense of the workers nor of other disempowered groups was a conspiracy on its own, and never was there a malignant plot to convert the first into the second \u2014 which is what \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d implies. Deployed to avoid claims of injustice, the charge functions to whip up agitated frenzy or inspire visions of revenge.\n\nAnd while increasingly popular worries about cosmopolitan elites and economic globalization can sometimes transcend the most noxious anti-Semitism, talk of cultural Marxism is inseparable from it. The legend of cultural Marxism recycles old anti-Semitic tropes to give those who feel threatened a scapegoat.\n\nA number of the conspiracy theorists tracing the origins of \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d assign outsize significance to the Frankfurt School, an interwar German \u2014 and mostly Jewish \u2014 intellectual collective of left-wing social theorists and philosophers. Many members of the Frankfurt School fled Nazism and came to the United States, which is where they supposedly uploaded the virus of cultural Marxism to America.

And part of the wonder of Laymon\u2019s book is his commitment to getting as close to the truth as possible, even when it means asking painful questions about what we owe the people who brought us into this world and, somehow, managed to keep us alive in it. In doing so, he compels us to consider the costs of an insistence on excellence as a means to an end and the only conceivable option for a black kid in America. The toll \u2014 physical, emotional \u2014 is painful to behold, especially for readers who have paid a similar price. Laymon\u2019s writing, as rich and elegant as mahogany, offers us comfort even as we grapple with his book\u2019s unflinching honesty.\n\nImage\n\nJust before he started eighth grade, the poor black Catholic school he\u2019d been attending was closed down owing to a lack of funding. That\u2019s how Laymon and a handful of his friends end up at St. Richard Catholic School in Jackson, turning vocabulary words into gold and trying their best to avoid teachers who openly admit they find some of the new black students \u201cgross.\u201d Well aware of the challenges this new school poses to her son, his mother warns him to \u201cbe twice as excellent and be twice as careful from this point on\u201d because \u201cbeing anything less will get you hell.\u201d\n\nIf this book succeeds as a thoughtful and hard-wrought examination of how a black man came into his own in a country determined to prevent that from happening, it\u2019s because of the painstaking manner in which Laymon walks the reader through the various perils and costs of striving. When simply being black in America is often a taxing affair, the perception that the choice is between being black and excellent or being black and dead reveals just how cruel this country can be. To say nothing of how often \u201cexcellence\u201d and \u201crespectability\u201d are tragically mistaken for each other.\n\nIt\u2019s heartbreaking to see how, again and again, that cruelty warps Laymon\u2019s relationship with his mother as she resorts to violence to keep her son in line. When she and Laymon are pulled over by a white policeman in Maryland for driving while black, the officer asks his mother if Laymon is her husband. It\u2019s a long-awaited dread come to fruition: the moment a black teenage boy begins to look, to casual white onlookers, like an adult. She quickly responds that her son is 15 and hands over her ID. As Laymon begins to lose his temper, his mother forcefully slaps him across the chest, telling him to be quiet and unclench his fists. As she well knows, any behavior less than excellent as determined by a white police officer at such a moment could be fatal.\n\nLater, when his mother finds out he has been having sex with a white girl, she greets him at the door by beating him in the neck. She would argue this is to impress upon him the risks of an interracial relationship in Mississippi but also because she\u2019d prefer him to be dating a black girl. It\u2019s one of many harrowing moments in which \u2014 however you might feel about parents disciplining their kids \u2014 it\u2019s clear that her actions have veered into physical abuse.", "[Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty, conflict and consequence.]\n\nThe replacement the Army envisions involves a series of mines connected by a wireless network, far removed from American troops, who would monitor sensors attached to the weapons. When a vehicle approaches, the sensors would alert the operator, who would then decide whether to detonate the mine \u2014 based on whether the approaching vehicle posed a threat. The Army has not given details as to how operators would be able to see the approaching vehicle. The mines would also have a self-destruct feature that could be manually triggered so that the munitions didn\u2019t detonate later by mistake. The Army plans to drop these mines into place from warplanes, according to details released by Picatinny Arsenal. The design plans raise many unanswered questions: How would these mines, with their sensitive electronics and sensors, survive high-speed impact with the ground? How accurate would they be as scattered? How would the required wireless network activate and then connect with distant control stations? What would power them?\n\nHow are these mines going to be different from older mines?\n\nTripwires and pressure-plates are the hallmark of victim-operated weapons, meaning that they are triggered by the person or vehicle they are targeting \u2014 or anyone else who comes in contact with them. Given their inability to discriminate between combatants and civilians, conventional antipersonnel mines are banned by more than 160 countries under the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, also known at the Ottawa Treaty. The 30-year-old antivehicle land mines the Army wishes to replace were a bit more sophisticated; they used sensors to measure the change in the surrounding magnetic field as armored vehicles approached and detonated themselves, but they still posed a threat to any civilian vehicle that drove nearby. The future Gator Replacement mines are meant to detonate only upon the command of a soldier who is able to positively identify a potential target as an enemy combatant. But what kind of information would the sensors send to operators, so they might tell an enemy tank from a civilian truck or sedan? The Army has not publicly released details and faces significant technological hurdles to accomplish its goal.\n\nWhen is the last time the United States used land mines in conflict?\n\nIn the 1970s, the Army spent millions of dollars on what it called \u201cscatterable mines\u201d \u2014 cluster bombs and artillery shells containing antipersonnel and antivehicle land mines designed to self-destruct after a preset amount of time. These more advanced mines were supposed to be safer than older generations and not leave behind duds, or munitions that have the potential to detonate. Their combat debut in 1991 did not bear that out. During the Persian Gulf war, American warplanes dropped 1,314 \u201cGator\u201d cluster bombs that cast almost 90,000 anti-vehicle mines and 27,500 antipersonnel mines into the Kuwaiti and Iraqi sands. At $39,000 per bomb, they were three times as expensive as any other airdropped cluster munition the American military had in its inventory. Contract deminers working in Kuwait shortly after the war reported finding 205 dud antitank mines and 841 antipersonnel mines from Gator bombs; the total number of dud mines found in Iraq after the war is unknown.\n\nWhether these weapons played any role in defending American troops on the ground is unclear. On Jan. 30, 1991, three howitzer units from Fifth Battalion, 11th Marine Regiment, fired the first and possibly only artillery-delivered scatterable mine mission in history, spreading more than 850 mines between a series of observation posts located along the Saudi-Kuwaiti border. Although those mines were supposed to self-destruct, contract deminers found hundred of their duds in Kuwait after the war. The State Department has acknowledged the use of land mines only once since then: a \u201csingle munition\u201d used in Afghanistan in 2002.", "\u201cThere\u2019s visual similarities in the disorder and chaos and smoke and fire and all that,\u201d said Robert Spangle, who lives in Malibu and served in the Marine Corps, with two deployments to Afghanistan.\n\nMr. Spangle is now a photographer, and has worked in Iraq, too.

And it\u2019s been palpable in Malibu \u2014 in normal times, a place of wealth and celebrity and sunshine, but amid a calamity, not much different in some ways from any other suffering corner of the globe.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s that sort of communal bond that really comes out in adverse conditions,\u201d Mr. Spangle said.\n\nIn Iraq, he said, he saw neighbors carrying the injured down the street, and in Malibu he has seen similar moments of people helping one another. \u201cThe neighborhoods here in Malibu are really tight-knit,\u201d said Mr. Spangle, whose mother lost her house in the fire.", "They\u2019d spent the morning before our drive hitchhiking to the market and back with their two children since, as Inia explained, it would take a Fijian at least 10 years of working hard to earn enough money to buy a car. Most people seemed to get around by bus, horse, hitchhiking or on foot.\n\nOn a wonderful jet boat safari along Fiji\u2019s longest river, the Sigatoka, I visited a village of around 70 inhabitants, where we ate a home-cooked meal, sang and danced, and drank kava, a ceremonial drink made from a dried root that makes your tongue numb. And I sated my newfound addiction for all things under the sea with half a day on a private boat with a local islander, Nox. For 400 Fijian dollars ($186, a steal), he took me to a sandbar in the middle of the ocean next to a reef so full of shapes in bright greens and purples it could have been drawn by Disney cartoonists. I jumped in without hesitation.\n\nRiding the waves\n\n\u201cAre you ready to catch some waves?\u201d asked the Fiji Surf Co. instructor Koto Vakamoce when he picked me up in the company van, surfboards stacked on top.\n\nI was not ready, I said, half-joking, but I had already paid for an introductory lesson and we were on our way, so it seemed like this was happening.\n\nKoto is from the small island of Fulaga, so far south it\u2019s practically Tonga. There\u2019s no tourism there, only fishing; he\u2019d grown up in the water, but hadn\u2019t seen a surfboard until he made it to the big island eight years ago. That\u2019s also when he met his wife, Mary, who was in the van with us and took a nap while we surfed.\n\nAn hour south of the city of Nadi, Koto turned onto a hilly dirt road, which led to beautiful Natadola Beach, where loose horses moseyed around. Our surfing spot would be in front of the Intercontinental Hotel, where the waves broke far from shore at high tide \u2014 gentle enough for a newbie like me.\n\nKoto wasn\u2019t much of a talker, which helped make for simple instructions. On shore, he ran through his four basic commands. \u201cOn your board,\u201d \u201cready,\u201d \u201cpaddle\u201d and \u201cstand up!\u201d I would start out on a super-buoyant, 10-foot board and, if all went well, would graduate to a nine-footer.

I was freaking out, until I realized that the water was shallow enough for my feet to touch the bottom.", "What is happening in Midtown Manhattan underscores the challenges in New York and many other American cities of creating public spaces that, by definition, are open to all and a cornerstone of urban life, especially in space-starved communities. From pocket-size parks to plazas on reclaimed roadways to sidewalks dressed up with sleek benches and kiosks, the spaces make concrete-and-asphalt grids more inviting.\n\nBut as these public spaces have proliferated, they have also become testing grounds for what is acceptable \u2014 and unacceptable \u2014 public behavior. Cities including Honolulu, San Francisco, Colorado Springs and Charleston, S.C., have passed laws or regulations against sitting or lying down on sidewalks. Some cities have banned people from camping or even sleeping in public spaces.\n\n\u201cThis is a big issue for the people who manage public spaces in virtually every city in the country, and depending on what the rules and laws are, it\u2019s an almost intractable problem in most cases,\u201d said Adrian Benepe, a senior vice president for the Trust for Public Land, and a former New York City parks commissioner.\n\nMany city and business leaders say setting basic rules of conduct helps ensure that public spaces can be enjoyed by everyone and addresses public health and safety concerns. Advocates for the homeless counter that such measures are unconstitutional, target the homeless and keep out people who have nowhere else to go.\n\n\u201cAre you going to tell me I can\u2019t use a public space because I don\u2019t have a home?\u2019\u2019 said Jason Flores, 30, who moved to New York from Philadelphia and sleeps in public areas because he has no money.", "Democrats had a great showing in the 2018 midterm elections. But even in such a strong year, they sometimes struggled to match their traditional support in electorally significant areas \u2014 with serious implications for 2020.\n\nTheir triumph was a somewhat narrow one, concentrated in well-educated, affluent communities. Over all, the distribution of Democratic and Republican support was reminiscent of the 2016 election, when Democrats won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College.\n\nYes, Democrats can muscle their way through those disadvantages with a big enough win, like their seven-point advantage in the House popular vote.

Though 1,550,000 were classed in 2017 as destitute, or experiencing extreme poverty, by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a poverty research group, that figure was a quarter less than in 2015.\n\nIf Mr. Alston ends up linking poverty to the government\u2019s benefit policies, \u201che would just be adding more noise,\u201d said Edward Davies, director of policy at the Center for Social Justice, a think tank founded by Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative minister who spearheaded the reforms. \u201cMy fear is that we have a debate about welfare reform in this country, and he could get embroiled in that.\u201d\n\nCommenting on Mr. Alston\u2019s visit in a written statement, a government spokesman said that child and overall poverty rates had fallen since the Conservatives entered office \u2014 using a different measure from the one preferred by poverty researchers at the Rowntree Foundation and the Child Poverty Action Group.\n\nMr. Alston said he was keeping an open mind.

The older generations, reared on consensus, are not used to open public debate, let alone diversity. But the younger ones are opting for a new social order that includes people of other ethnic backgrounds and sexual orientations. They do not fear immigrants as much as they fear the fact that they can\u2019t afford housing or taking care of their parents once they get old.\n\nYounger generations have always had different needs from their elders, but in the past the establishment has found ways to meet those needs without ceding power.

The decision effectively deepened the turmoil in Georgia\u2019s campaign for governor, a still unsettled contest that has been among the most acrimonious campaigns in the nation this year.\n\nAlthough the ruling by Judge Amy Totenberg of Federal District Court in Atlanta formally affected every election in Georgia for state and federal office, it reverberated most immediately and powerfully through the governor\u2019s race, in which the Democratic candidate, Stacey Abrams, was within 21,000 votes of forcing a runoff election against Brian Kemp, the Republican nominee.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s secretary of state, Robyn A. Crittenden, had been preparing to certify the outcome of the election as soon as Wednesday, one day after Georgia\u2019s 159 counties were to complete their tabulations and six days before state law mandated certification. But in a 56-page ruling on Monday night, Judge Totenberg forbade Ms. Crittenden, who assumed office only last week, from certifying the results until at least Friday evening.\n\nJudge Totenberg, who had already raised concerns about Georgia\u2019s system of elections this year, wrote that the state\u2019s announced timetable for a swift certification \u201cappears to suggest the secretary\u2019s foregoing of its responsibility to confirm the accuracy of the results prior to final certification, including the assessment of whether serious provisional balloting count issues have been consistently and properly handled.\u201d", "David Pearson, who was hailed as Nascar\u2019s Silver Fox for his cunning behind the wheel, which propelled him to three top-series championships and acclaim as perhaps the most brilliant driver in the history of stock-car racing, died on Monday.

Pearson lived in Spartanburg, S.C., in his retirement years, collecting classic cars.\n\nOver 27 racing seasons Pearson won 105 times, second only to Richard Petty\u2019s 200 while driving in less than half as many events. He entered the Nascar Hall of Fame in Charlotte, N.C., in 2011 as a member of its second class of inductees.\n\nPetty and Dale Earnhardt each won a record seven Nascar championships, but polling of prominent stock-car figures conducted by Sports Illustrated in 1999 and The Sporting News in 2011 proclaimed Pearson as Nascar\u2019s greatest driver.", "PARADISE, Calif. \u2014 Has anyone heard from Billy?

Instead, Iran quietly helped Iraqis forge a political alliance that formed a government reliant on Iranian-backed militias that the United States wants disbanded.\n\nNow, the leaders in Tehran may well expect that a weakened Saudi Arabia could be compelled to end both its military campaign in Yemen and its blockade of Qatar. All along, the Iranians have sought talks with the Saudis, who may be ready to talk to them \u2014 especially if the Saudis take American advice and decide to end the Yemen war. The government in Riyadh may also find it necessary to mend relations with Iran to rebalance its relations with Turkey, which has been aligned with a buoyant Qatar and was further angered by the Saudi assassination on Turkish soil.\n\nRemaining calm, in turn, might give Iran\u2019s leaders greater confidence in their own bargaining power, perhaps to the point of talking to the United States about its nuclear and missile programs. The ruling circles in Tehran already seem confident that the economy has absorbed much of the shock of American sanctions and that Iran can sell enough oil and have enough trade with Europe, China, Russia and India to keep its economy afloat. Conservatives and moderates have formed a united front to rally the population to the flag and to fend off any popular discontent that the United States might hope economic hardship would bring.\n\nThe Trump administration has derided the nuclear deal, asserting that it was failing to curb Iran\u2019s regional influence and claiming to want a new deal strong enough to do just that. But Mr. Trump will now find it even more difficult to deliver on his promise of forcing Iran to come to the table on his terms. If Iran comes at all, it will not be in a position of abject weakness. All it needs to do is remain committed to the deal it signed with Barack Obama and let Mr. Trump recognize that his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy falls short. Then Tehran might be ready to talk.\n\nFrom the start, the Trump administration thought it could rein in Iran\u2019s regional influence by forging a close partnership with Saudi Arabia\u2019s young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. But a series of heavy-handed Saudi missteps, culminating in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, have backfired, leaving Iran with much more room for strategic initiatives.", "TAIPEI \u2014 Shares in Asian suppliers and assemblers for Apple Inc fell on Tuesday due to profit warnings that point to weakness in iPhone sales.\n\nTaiwan-based assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) dropped more than 3 percent and rival Pegatron Corp fell more than 5 percent.

Screen maker Japan Display Inc cited lower smartphone demand in cutting its outlook, while British chipmaker IQE Plc said it expects a reduction in its performance this year.", "Facebook failed to closely monitor device makers after granting them access to the personal data of hundreds of millions of people, according to a previously unreported disclosure to Congress last month.\n\nFacebook\u2019s loose oversight of the partnerships was detected by the company\u2019s government-approved privacy monitor in 2013. But it was never revealed to Facebook users, most of whom had not explicitly given the company permission to share their information. Details of those oversight practices were revealed in a letter Facebook sent last month to Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, a privacy advocate and frequent critic of the social media giant.\n\nIn the letter, a copy of which Mr. Wyden provided to The New York Times, Facebook wrote that by early 2013 it had entered into data-sharing agreements with seven device makers to provide what it called the \u201cFacebook experience\u201d \u2014 custom-built software, typically, that gave those manufacturers\u2019 customers access to Facebook on their phones. Those partnerships, some of which date to at least 2010, fall under a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission drafted in 2011 and intended to oversee the company\u2019s privacy practices.\n\n[Read more about Facebook\u2019s data-sharing partnerships with device makers.]\n\nFacebook ultimately entered into dozens of similar data-sharing partnerships, most of which the company began winding down this spring after revelations that it had allowed Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm, to acquire the personal information of tens of millions of people. The firm used some of that information in efforts to aid President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.", "The effort that Mr. Scott and Republican allies are waging today is strikingly similar to that multifront war in 2000 led by the George W. Bush campaign and an army of party consultants. Lawyers are filing complaints in Tallahassee; surrogates for the Republican candidate are holding news conference calls with journalists and sitting for interviews on cable, blaming the Democrats for tarnishing the integrity of the electoral process; and party officials are encouraging demonstrators to gather at sites where the recounts are taking place.\n\n\u201cThe tactics are the same, the issues are the same, the problems are the same,\u201d said Brad Blakeman, a Republican consultant who worked on the party\u2019s messaging in 2000. \u201cAnd quite frankly,\u201d he added, \u201cthe solutions are going to be the same if no one concedes, because again you\u2019re going to have a court determining the outcome.\u201d\n\nThere is one new variable, however: Mr. Trump.\n\nThe president, who has long fanned unfounded claims of voter fraud, is especially concerned with the Florida outcome, according to people in touch with him about the recount. And he equates his political success with that of Ron DeSantis, the Republican nominee for governor whose campaign was taken over by Trump aides, as well as with that of Mr. Scott, whose victory he believes he ensured by campaigning across the state and pulling him over the finish line. Mr. Trump sees the recounts, one person close to him said, as akin to a personal attack.\n\nMr. Trump has been more combative and unrestrained in slinging claims of fraud and unfairness than Mr. Scott or Mr. DeSantis. The recount story hits many of the president\u2019s sore spots, including his frequent insistence that his political opponents cheat against him and his unproved belief that American elections are tainted with illegal voting, especially by undocumented immigrants.\n\nBut with such aggressive, unyielding attacks on Democrats, Mr. Trump and his Republicans risk treading into territory that is a minefield of tension over race. Their repeated allegations of subterfuge and fraudulent ballots are a blunt appeal to a political base motivated by the notion that elections are often stolen by Democrats. And in this case, some of the central players are African-Americans, including Mr. Gillum and the Broward County supervisor of elections, Brenda C. Snipes, whom Republicans like Mr. Scott have called out by name for enabling \u201crampant fraud,\u201d as the governor put it last week.\n\nIn the face of the Republican cries of ballot fraud and political mischief, Judge Tuter in Broward County refused a request by Mr. Scott to order the county police to impound voting machines and ballots when they are not in use. The judge was also critical of comments made by Mr. Scott\u2019s lawyers on television and social media perpetuating the unsubstantiated rumors of fraud.", "Which is not to say this new regulation is legally sound. As it stands , federal asylum law is unambiguous: Any person who is either \u201cphysically present\u201d or \u201carrives\u201d in the United States, no matter if said person arrived \u201cat a designated port of arrival\u201d or not, is entitled to apply for asylum. Desperate migrants, many of them fleeing violence or persecution with their families, cannot be expected to know the new rule Mr. Trump has imposed \u2014 only that asylum, as a matter of international law, may be within reach once they touch American soil. The president can\u2019t, with the stroke of a pen, disregard people with credible asylum claims who don\u2019t present themselves at a port of entry.\n\nBy issuing the ban and ensnaring those who don\u2019t comply with it, the administration is clearly aiming to deny people largely from the Northern Triangle \u2014 Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras \u2014 an opportunity to make their case for asylum and instead put them on a fast track to deportation. Many of them, in fact, have humanitarian reasons to flee their countries and seek shelter in the United States. Shutting off one avenue for them to do so and redirecting them to official border crossings will only lead to greater backlogs and discourage claims with real merit.\n\nIn anticipation of court challenges \u2014 the American Civil Liberties Union on Friday announced the first lawsuit over the proclamation \u2014 the Department of Homeland Security has published a tipsheet trying to soften the blow. There we\u2019re told that Mr. Trump\u2019s proclamation is not just lawful but also constitutional, relying on the same misguided Supreme Court case that eventually blessed Mr. Trump\u2019s entry ban on Muslim travelers.\n\nLike Mr. Trump\u2019s wasteful, needless deployment of thousands of active-duty troops to the border, the asylum ban works more or less like an imaginary wall: a substitute for the physical wall that even unified control of Congress could never give him. And that a Democratic-controlled House never will.\n\nMr. Trump may have left some with the impression that, once the midterms were over, he had no more use for the caravan of Central American migrants that he had fantasized about to frighten his supporters to the polls. But like the Muslim ban, which was also gestated in a political contest, the one that elected him president, Friday\u2019s asylum ban demonstrates that Mr. Trump\u2019s nativist impulses are guides not just to his campaigns but also to his governing.\n\nHe creates nonexistent threats, generates manufactured fears and prepares exaggerated responses, all leading to an erosion of the rule of law, to feed more fears.", "[Read the bill language here.]\n\n\u201cWe have the clearest path forward that we have had in years,\u201d said Holly Harris, the executive director of the Justice Action Network, a bipartisan coalition arguing for an overhaul. \u201cThis would be the first time that these members have voted on a piece of legislation that turns away from the lock-\u2019em-up-and-throw-away-the-keys policies of the 1990s. That is groundbreaking.\u201d\n\nLawmakers and outside advocates involved in the push expect Mr. Trump to render his judgment on the package as soon as this week. Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and the leading voice within the White House for the changes, is likely to brief Mr. Trump on the bill during a broader discussion of legislative priorities with top policy officials on Tuesday, according to one senior administration official, who was granted anonymity to discuss the plans. And at least two influential Republican senators were lobbying the president in its favor.\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has told the senators he will bring the package up for a vote if they can show they had the support of at least 60 senators. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, a vocal advocate of such changes, committed to putting the compromise on the House floor in a lame-duck session that begins on Tuesday if Mr. Trump endorses it and it can clear the Senate.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Ryan has long advocated for criminal justice reform,\u201d said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan. \u201cThe House passed legislation earlier this year, and we are hopeful the Senate will act so we can get a bill to the president\u2019s desk.\u201d\n\nThe support of the famously mercurial Mr. Trump is by no means guaranteed. But if they can secure an endorsement, senators say they can move quickly on the kind of bipartisan achievement that has eluded Mr. Trump \u2014 and bedeviled senators and outside advocates of the overhaul for years.", "A black security guard at a bar in the Chicago suburbs was killed by the police as he apparently tried to detain a man he believed to be involved in a shooting, the authorities said Monday.\n\nOfficers from several police departments had responded to reports of a shooting early Sunday morning at Manny\u2019s Luxury Lounge in Robbins, Ill., said Sophia Ansari, a spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nWitnesses told the police that a fight had broken out and someone had started shooting.

Congress and many others have condemned the 2016 Russian attacks on the Democratic National Committee and the private email accounts of senior officials in Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. But the United States has interfered in foreign elections before, including Italy in the 1940s and Iran and Latin America in the 1950s and 1960s, and some officials say that no American president should be forced to give up that tool if it could prevent a war.\n\nSimilarly, the Pentagon worries about commitments to avoid using cyberattacks as a prelude to military action. The United States had a secret program, code-named \u201cNitro Zeus,\u201d which called for turning off the power grid in much of Iran if the two countries had found themselves in a conflict over Iran\u2019s nuclear program.

Meet the KGB spies who conceived this virus and the American truth squads who tried \u2014 and are still trying \u2014 to fight it. Countries from Pakistan to Brazil are now debating reality, and in Vladimir Putin\u2019s greatest triumph, Americans are using Russia\u2019s playbook against one another without the faintest clue.", "The Pizzagate playbook: Same tactics, new technologies. How the seven rules of Soviet disinformation are being used to create today\u2019s fake news stories. Pizza anyone?", "Governments from Pakistan to Mexico to Washington are woefully unequipped to combat disinformation warfare. Eastern European countries living in Russia\u2019s shadow can teach us how to start fighting back, but only if our politicians decide to stop profiting from these tactics and fight them instead.", "An agreement to open up the shellfish trade would hardly be a diplomatic breakthrough, because it was near completion anyway. But it would allow Ms. Malmstrom and Mr. Lighthizer to announce something concrete, and might help build trust.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has banned European shellfish since the 1980s because of doubts about sanitation standards. Several years ago, though, food safety officials on both sides of the Atlantic began to perform detailed reviews of each other\u2019s quality controls and agreed that they were equally rigorous.\n\nThat opened the door for the F.D.A. to issue a proposal in March to lift the seafood ban, initially for mollusks from Spain and the Netherlands. The European Union would reciprocate by allowing in shellfish from Massachusetts and Washington and eventually other states.\n\nEuropeans also hope that with the midterm elections complete in the United States, Mr. Trump will be more willing to call a truce with Europe and join forces to deal with China. The European Union shares many of Mr. Trump\u2019s objections to Chinese trade policies, including de facto government subsidies for Chinese companies.\n\nFor Americans, the trade war\u2019s negative side effects \u2014 higher prices, job losses \u2014 are likely to become clearer in the months ahead. When that happens, Mr. Trump could feel pressure to ease up on Europe. The German carmaker BMW said last week that the trade war had cost it nearly 300 million euros, or $337 million, and that it might have to move some production from Spartanburg, S.C., to China to avoid tariffs.\n\nA few optimists are holding out hope that the United States and Europe will pursue a stripped-down version of the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, better known as TTIP, a far-reaching deal begun under the Obama administration and abandoned by Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThere is a quiet belief in Brussels that after these midterm results the Trump administration will remain keen on a baby TTIP deal with the E.U. as tensions with China are almost certainly set to escalate,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director in Europe for the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm.", "The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul that President Trump signed into law late last year has already given the American economy a jolt, at least temporarily. It has fattened the paychecks of most American workers, padded the profits of large corporations and sped economic growth.\n\nThose results weren\u2019t a surprise. Economists across the ideological spectrum predicted the new law would fuel consumer spending, in classic fashion: When the government borrows money and dumps it into the economy, growth tends to accelerate. But Republicans did not sell the law as a sugar-high stimulus. They sold it as a refashioning of the incentives in the American economy \u2014 one that would unleash more investment, better efficiency and higher wages, along with enough growth to offset any revenue lost to the government from lower tax rates.\n\nTen months after the law took effect, that promised \u201csupply-side\u201d bump is harder to find than the sugar-high stimulus. It\u2019s still early, but here\u2019s what the numbers tell us so far:\n\nThe Investment Bump\n\nProponents of the tax overhaul said it would supercharge the recent lackluster pace of business spending on long-term investments like buildings, factories, equipment and technology.\n\nSuch spending is crucial to keeping economic growth strong. And strong growth is central to Republican claims that the tax cuts would ultimately pay for themselves.", "Patrick Chappatte is an editorial cartoonist for The New York Times.

Wind and solar power are poised to become dominant sources of electricity. China\u2019s once-relentless appetite for coal is set to wane. The amount of oil we use to fuel our cars could peak and decline.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch: The global march toward clean energy still isn\u2019t happening fast enough to avoid dangerous global warming, at least not unless governments put forceful new policy measures in place to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThat\u2019s the conclusion of the International Energy Agency, which on Monday published its annual World Energy Outlook, a 661-page report that forecasts global energy trends to 2040. These projections are especially difficult right now because the world\u2019s energy markets, which usually evolve gradually, are going through a major upheaval.\n\nHere are some of the report\u2019s major themes:\n\nWind and solar are making gains\n\nAround the world, the electricity sector \u201cis experiencing its most dramatic transformation since its creation more than a century ago,\u201d the report said. One big factor is the rapid growth of wind and solar power.", "The war blew away that gentility, those ideals and that faith in progress. Ernest Hemingway captured the rising irony and cynicism in \u201cA Farewell to Arms.\u201d His hero is embarrassed \u201cby the words sacred, glorious and sacrifice and the expression, in vain.\u201d He had seen nothing sacred in the war, nothing glorious, just meaningless slaughter.\n\nEuropean culture suffered a massive disillusion during the conflict \u2014 no God, no beauty, no coherence, no meaning, just the cruel ironic joke of life. Cynicism breeds a kind of nihilism, a disbelief in all values, an assumption that others\u2019 motives are bad. It makes it hard to see the good that remains.\n\nFussell wrote that the war spread an adversarial mentality. The men in the trenches were obsessed with the enemy \u2014 those anonymous creatures across no man\u2019s land who rained down death. \u201cProlonged trench warfare, whether enacted or remembered, fosters paranoid melodrama,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe \u201cversus habit\u201d construes reality as us versus them \u2014 a mentality that spread through British society. It was the officers versus the men, and, when they got home, the students at university versus the dons. \u201cSimple antithesis everywhere\u201d is how Fussell captured the mentality. Along with it was what T.S. Eliot called a \u201cdissociation of sensibility,\u201d in which thoughts of tenderness and care are cut off from reason and calculation.\n\nGeorge Orwell wrote that he recognized the Great War mentality lingering even in the 1930s in his own left-wing circles \u2014 the same desire to sniff out those who departed from party orthodoxy, the same retelling of mostly false atrocity stories, the same war hysteria. As Christopher Isherwood put it, all the young people who were ashamed of never having fought in the war brought warlike simplicities to political life.\n\nSome of the disillusioned drop out of public life, since it\u2019s all meaningless. But others want to burn it all down because it\u2019s all rotten. Moderation is taken for cowardice. Aggression is regarded as courage. No conciliatory word is permitted when a fighting word will do.\n\nToday we face no horrors equal to the Great War, but there is the same loss of faith in progress, the reality of endless political trench warfare, the paranoid melodrama, the specter that we are all being dehumanized amid the fight."]
