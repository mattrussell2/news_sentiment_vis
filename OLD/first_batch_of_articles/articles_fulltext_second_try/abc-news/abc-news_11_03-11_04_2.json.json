Add Interest\n\nLittle more than a week ago, he insisted he deserves \"no blame\" for what he called the \"hatred\" seemingly coursing through parts of the country, and outside of the White House on Friday, Trump accused news outlets of fomenting the very violence they've been asking him about.\n\nBut a nationwide review conducted by ABC News has identified at least 17 criminal cases where Trump's name was invoked in direct connection with violent acts, threats of violence or allegations of assault.\n\nNearly all -- 16 of 17 -- cases identified by ABC News are striking in that court documents and direct evidence reflect someone echoing presidential rhetoric, not protesting it. ABC News was unable to find any such case echoing presidential rhetoric when Barack Obama or George W. Bush were in the White House.\n\nThe perpetrators and suspects identified in the 17 cases are mostly white men, as young as teenagers and as old as 68, while the victims represent an array of minority groups -- African-Americans, Latinos, Muslims and gay men.\n\nFederal law enforcement authorities have privately told ABC News they worry that -- even with Trump's public denunciations of violence -- Trump's style could inspire violence-prone individuals to take action against minorities or others they perceive to be against the president's agenda.\n\nEd Kennedy via Reuters\n\nWhile asserting that \"fake\" media coverage is exacerbating divisions in the country, Trump has noted that \"a fan\" of former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders opened fire on Republican lawmakers playing baseball in a Washington suburb last year.\n\n\"Nobody puts ... 'Bernie Sanders' in the headline with the maniac,\" Trump said last week. But there's no indication the shooter mentioned Sanders while launching his attack, and no criminal case was ever brought because he was fatally shot during his assault.\n\nIn identifying the 17 Trump-related cases, ABC News excluded incidents where charges were never brought and incidents of Trump-inspired vandalism.\n\nIn conducting its review, ABC News did find several cases where pro-Trump defendants were charged with targeting minorities, or where speculation online suggested the defendants were motivated by Trump, but in those cases ABC News found no police records, court proceedings or other direct evidence presenting a definitive link to the president. So those cases also were excluded in the ABC News tally.\n\nABC News found at least one case out of Chicago featuring anti-Trump rhetoric in connection with violence.\n\nOn Thursday, ABC News sent a list of the cases it identified to White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders for comment. As of Sunday evening, three days later, she had yet to respond. Trump has previously told reporters he's \"committed to doing everything\" in his power to not let political violence \"take root in America.\"\n\nHere are the cases identified by ABC News:\n\nSuffolk County District Attorneys Office\n\nAUG. 19, 2015: In Boston, after he and his brother beat a sleeping homeless man of Mexican descent with a metal pole, Steven Leader, 30, told police \"Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported.\" The victim, however, was not in the United States illegally. The brothers, who are white, ultimately pleaded guilty to several assault-related charges and were each sentenced to at least two years in prison.\n\nDEC. 5, 2015: After Penn State University student Nicholas Tavella, 19, was charged with \"ethnic intimidation\" and other crimes for threatening to \"put a bullet\" in a young Indian man on campus, his attorney argued in court that Tavella was just motivated by \"a love of country,\" not \"hate.\" \"Donald Trump is running for President of the United States saying that, 'We've got to check people out more closely,'\" Tavella's attorney argued in his defense. Tavella, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to ethnic intimidation and was sentenced to up to two years in prison.\n\nU.S. Department of Justice\n\nAPRIL 28, 2016: When FBI agents arrested 61-year-old John Martin Roos in White City, Oregon, for threatening federal officials, including then-President Barack Obama, they found several pipe bombs and guns in his home. In the three months before his arrest, Roos posted at least 34 messages to Twitter about Trump, repeatedly threatening African Americans, Muslims, Mexican immigrants and the \"liberal media,\" and in court documents, prosecutors noted that the avowed Trump supporter posted this threatening message to Facebook a month earlier: \"The establishment is trying to steal the election from Trump. ... Obama is already on a kill list ... Your [name] can be there too.\" Roos, who is white, has since pleaded guilty to possessing an unregistered explosive device and posting Internet threats against federal officials. He was sentenced to more than five years in prison.\n\nJUNE 3, 2016: After 54-year-old Henry Slapnik attacked his African-American neighbors with a knife in Cleveland, he told police \"Donald Trump will fix them because they are scared of Donald Trump,\" according to police reports. Slapnik, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to \"ethnic intimidation\" and other charges. It's unclear what sentence he received.\n\nAUG. 16, 2016: In Olympia, Washington, 32-year-old Daniel Rowe attacked a white woman and a black man with a knife after seeing them kiss on a popular street. When police arrived on the scene, Rowe professed to being \"a white supremacist\" and said \"he planned on heading down to the next Donald Trump rally and stomping out more of the Black Lives Matter group,\" according to court documents filed in the case. Rowe, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to charges of assault and malicious harassment, and he was sentenced to more than four years in prison.\n\nCleveland Police Department\n\nSEPT. 1, 2016: The then-chief of the Bordentown, New Jersey, police department, Frank Nucera, allegedly assaulted an African-American teenager who was handcuffed. Federal prosecutors said the attack was part of Nucera's \"intense racial animus,\" noting in federal court that \"within hours\" of the assault, Nucera was secretly recorded saying \"Donald Trump is the last hope for white people.\" The 60-year-old Nucera has been indicted by a federal grand jury on three charges, including committing a federal hate crime. Nucera, who is white, has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. He retired last year.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2016: After 40-year-old Mark Feigin of Los Angeles was arrested for posting anti-Muslim and allegedly threatening statements to a mosque's Facebook page, his attorney argued in court that the comments were protected by the First Amendment because Feigin was \"using similar language and expressing similar views\" to \"campaign statements from then-candidate Donald Trump.\" Noting that his client \"supported Donald Trump,\" attorney Caleb Mason added that \"Mr. Feigin's comments were directed toward a pressing issue of public concern that was a central theme of the Trump campaign and the 2016 election generally: the Islamic roots of many international and U.S. terrorist acts.\" Feigin, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of sending harassing communications electronically. He was sentenced to probation.\n\nOCT. 13, 2016: After the FBI arrested three white Kansas men for plotting to bomb an apartment complex in Garden City, Kansas, where many Somali immigrants lived, one of the men's attorneys insisted to a federal judge that the plot was \"self-defensive\" because the three men believed \"that if Donald Trump won the election, President Obama would not recognize the validity of those results, that he would declare martial law, and that at that point militias all over the country would have to step in.\" Then, after a federal grand jury convicted 47-year-old Patrick Stein and the two other men of conspiracy-related charges, Stein's attorney argued for a lighter sentence based on \"the backdrop\" of Stein's actions: Trump had become \"the voice of a lost and ignored white, working-class set of voters\" like Stein, and the \"climate\" at the time could propel someone like Stein to \"go to 11,\" attorney Jim Pratt said in court. Stein and his two accomplices are awaiting sentencing.\n\nNOV. 3, 2016: In Tampa, Florida, David Howard threatened to burn down the house next to his \"simply because\" it was being purchased by a Muslim family, according to the Justice Department. He later said under oath that while he harbored a years-long dislike for Muslims, the circumstances around the home sale were \"the match that lit the wick.\" He cited Trump's warnings about immigrants from majority-Muslim countries. \"[With] the fact that the president wants these six countries vetted, everybody vetted before they come over, there's a concern about Muslims,\" Howard said. Howard, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to a federal civil rights violation, and the 59-year-old was sentenced to eight months in prison.\n\nNOV. 12, 2016: In Grand Rapids, Michigan, while attacking a cab driver from East Africa, 23-year-old Jacob Holtzlander shouted racial epithets and repeatedly yelled the word, \"Trump,\" according to law enforcement records. Holtzlander, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to a charge of ethnic intimidation, and he was sentenced to 30 days in jail.\n\nJAN. 3, 2017: In Chicago, four young African-Americans -- sisters Brittany and Tanishia Covington, Jordan Hill and Tesfaye Cooper -- tied up a white, mentally disabled man and assaulted him, forcing him to recite the phrases \"F--k Donald Trump\" and \"F--k white people\" while they broadcast the attack online. Each of them ultimately pleaded guilty to committing a hate crime and other charges, and three of them were sentenced to several years in prison.\n\nJAN. 25, 2017: At JFK International Airport in New York, a female Delta employee, wearing a hijab in accordance with her Muslim faith, was \"physically and verbally\" attacked by 57-year-old Robin Rhodes of Worcester, Mass., \"for no apparent reason,\" prosecutors said at the time. When the victim asked Brown what she did to him, he replied: \"You did nothing, but ... [Expletive] Islam. [Expletive] ISIS. Trump is here now. He will get rid of all of you.\" Rhodes ultimately pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of \"menacing,\" and he was sentenced to probation.\n\nFEB. 19, 2017: After 35-year-old Gerald Wallace called a mosque in Miami Gardens, Florida, and threatened to \"shoot all y'all,\" he told the FBI and police that he made the call because he \"got angry\" from a local TV news report about a terrorist act. At a rally in Florida the day before, Trump falsely claimed that Muslim refugees had just launched a terrorist attack in Sweden.\n\nWATCH WALLACE'S INTERVIEW WITH THE FBI AND POLICE:\n\nPlay\n\nWallace's attorney, Katie Carmon, later tried to convince a federal judge that the threat to kill worshippers could be \"protected speech\" due to the \"very distinctly political climate\" at the time. \"There are courts considering President Trump's travel ban ... and the president himself has made some very pointed statements about what he thinks about people of this descent,\" Carmon argued in court.\n\nHEAR CARMON'S REMARKS IN COURT:\n\nPlay\n\nWallace, who is African American, ultimately pleaded guilty to obstructing the free exercise of his victims' religious beliefs, and he was sentenced to one year in prison.\n\nFEB. 23, 2017: Kevin Seymour and his partner Kevin price were riding their bicycles in Key West, Florida, when a man on a moped, 30-year-old Brandon Davis of North Carolina, hurled anti-gay slurs at them and \"intentionally\" ran into Seymour's bike, shouting, \"You live in Trump country now,\" according to police reports and Davis' attorney. Davis ultimately pleaded guilty to a charge of battery evidencing prejudice, but in court, he expressed remorse and was sentenced to four years of probation.\n\nMAY 3, 2017: In South Padre Island, Texas, 35-year-old Alexander Jennes Downing of Waterford, Connecticut, was captured on cell phone video taunting and aggressively approaching a Muslim family, repeatedly shouting, \"Donald Trump will stop you!\" and other Trump-related remarks. Police arrested downing, of Waterford, Connecticut, for public intoxication. It's unclear what came of the charge.\n\nAUGUST 2018: After the Boston Globe called on news outlets around the country to resist what it called \"Trump's assault on journalism,\" the Boston Globe received more than a dozen threatening phone calls. \"You are the enemy of the people,\" the alleged caller, 68-year-old Robert Chain of Encino, California, told a Boston Globe employee on Aug. 22. \"As long as you keep attacking the President, the duly elected President of the United States ... I will continue to threat[en], harass, and annoy the Boston Globe.\" A week later, authorities arrested Chain on threat-related charges. After a hearing in his case, he told reporters, \"America was saved when Donald J. Trump was elected president.\" He has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial.\n\nLATE OCTOBER 2018: Over the course of a week, Florida man Cesar Sayoc allegedly mailed at least 15 potential bombs to prominent critics of Trump and members of the media. Sayoc had been living in a van plastered with pro-Trump stickers, and he had posted several pro-Trump messages on social media. While federal prosecutors have accused him of \"domestic terrorism\" and filed several bomb-related and assault charges against him, he has pleaded not guilty.\n\nABC News' Luke Barr, Karen Travers, Meredith McGraw and Alexis Scott contributed to this report.", "bad url", "President Trump ripped into Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams at a rally in Macon, Georgia, on Sunday, calling her \"radical,\" and \"one of the most extreme far-left politicians in the country.\"\n\nInterested in Donald Trump?

Add Interest\n\nThe president was headlining a rally for Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp, who he also endorsed during the primary, likely catapulting Kemp from second place to Republican nominee in the general election.\n\nA crowd of thousands in a Middle Georgia Regional Airport hangar cheered raucously for \"six more years\" of a Trump presidency. They also chanted \"lock her up\" during Trump's references to a woman who admitted to falsifying rape claims against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Those claims were not considered serious by Senate investigators, and stand in contrast to the allegations made by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nDuring the rally, Trump baselessly told the crowd that if Abrams is elected, \"your 2nd Amendment is gone.\"\n\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\nAbrams has campaigned on increasing gun control in Georgia while \"having respect for the 2nd Amendment.\"\n\nTrump also said Abrams \"wants illegal aliens to vote,\" a common criticism of Abrams referencing a video that surfaced of her saying undocumented immigrants are part of the so-call \"blue wave\" of Democratic voters expected to vote in this year's elections.\n\nAbrams refuted that accusation in an interview with ABC News' Deborah Roberts. \"I know that the only people who are allowed to vote are eligible citizens,\" said Abrams.\n\nThe president further riled up the crowd with references to the \"caravan\" of migrants moving from Central America towards the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\"You saw last week I called up the U.S. military, we\u2019re not playing games,\" he said of the thousands of U.S. troops headed to the border just days before the midterm election. \"Because you look at what\u2019s marching up, that\u2019s an invasion,\" he said.

Phil Scott, who is running for a second term in the historically blue state. Scott is facing a tough challenge since his approval ratings with his GOP base have tumbled following recent efforts to tighten gun control in Vermont.\n\nDespite being a liberal stronghold, particularly in presidential elections, Vermont residents are staunch supporters of gun rights -- with the state scoring an \"F\" according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nAdvancing a progressive platform focused on economic and social justice, including a $15 minimum wage, environmentally sustainable rural development and expanding access to internet services, the Democratic hopeful edged out challengers in a crowded primary.\n\n\"I am so proud to be the face of the Democrats tonight,\" Hallquist said during her primary victory party.\n\nAlong with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent who caucuses with Democrats, former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden endorsed Hallquist. During her primary race, she received the backing of Justice Democrats, a progressive political action committee founded by former Sanders campaign leaders, including Cenk Uygur of \"The Young Turks,\" which helped propel leftist superstar Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to her victory over longtime New York 14th Congressional District incumbent Joe Crowley earlier this summer.\n\nEthan Miller/Getty Images\n\nHallquist joins three other openly LGBTQ candidates for governor this year -- a historically high number -- including Lupe Valdez of Texas, Kate Brown of Oregon and Jared Polis of Colorado, all Democrats.\n\nBefore making a bid for governor, Hallquist was the chief executive of the Vermont Electric Cooperative for 12 years.

Their compass point was north, towards the U.S.\n\nTheir goal for the day was to reach Pijijiapan. The town, 30 miles away, was the next stop on a trek by thousands in a caravan that has so enraged U.S. President Donald Trump he has threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border and slash aid to Central America.\n\nUeslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nHonduran boys Adonai, 5, and Denzel, 8, set off from Mapastepec still fogged with sleep. Their mother, Glenda Escobar, 33, clutched her youngest's hand. Her friend, Maria, held onto Denzel's T-shirt.\n\nNo one had a torch. Potholes were treacherous. Only the floodlights of the odd truck in the opposite lane of the highway helped them see a few feet at a time.\n\nWithin minutes, a young man lay on his back, hugging his knee to his chest. He'd smashed his ankle on a rock, he said, and was in too much pain to stand. The single mother and her boys strode past, keeping pace with the long train of people.\n\nUeslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nEscobar\u2019s ultimate destination: Los Angeles, a city where she knows no one. \"It's because in my dreams, God told me that's where he's sending me,\" she said.\n\nTrump, who campaigned against illegal immigration and won the 2016 U.S. presidential election, has seized on this caravan in the run-up to the Nov. 6 midterm elections, firing up support for his Republican Party.\n\nYet the caravan\u2019s members make up a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of people who every year flee violence and poverty in Central America for the United States.\n\nEstimates on the size of the caravan vary from around 3,500 to more than double that. Some migrants have abandoned the journey, deterred by the hardships or the possibility of making a new life in Mexico. Others joined it in southern Mexico.\n\nUeslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nEscobar kneaded her shin. Agile and slight, she used to exercise regularly back home in the crime-wracked city of San Pedro Sula. But even the hardiest person would have struggled to cover the roughly 30 miles every day since she joined the caravan on Oct. 14.\n\nIf she and her boys were lucky, a passing car or minivan would give them a ride before the sun turned the day from sticky warm to sticky hot.\n\nSoon the boys watched wide-eyed as dozens, mainly young men, sprinted for the backs of slowing trucks and jumped aboard -- an impossible feat for a mother with two small children.\n\nUeslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nEscobar\u2019s family had had no food or water since residents of Mapastepec provided them a dinner of rice, beans, and eggs about 12 hours earlier.\n\nThat morning, there had been nothing to eat at the school where they slept on a three-foot square patch of floor, squeezed among dozens of parents with small children.\n\nAt least they had found shelter from the night's downpour that soaked hundreds who slept on the sidewalks.\n\nA shifting committee of self-appointed representatives in green jackets decide when to rise, move or sweep the streets they borrow for a night. The caravan follows like clockwork.\n\nUeslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nThrough Guatemala to southern Mexico, private citizens, church groups and local organizations offered help at almost every stop and on the walks in between.\n\nSince entering Mexico, they have been assisted by members of Pueblo Sin Fronteras, a migrant rights group that has guided caravans through the country for several years, including this current one that drew the ire of Trump in April.\n\nHis broadsides against that caravan have generated enormous publicity, convincing others desperate to leave Central America that caravans are a safer way to travel. Others have begun forming behind Escobar's group.\n\nUeslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nBy 9 a.m, two hours past sunrise, the first hitchhikers reached Pijijiapan.\n\nThe Escobars followed far behind.\n\n\"We've been going so many days,\" Escobar said, watching her sons flag, then suddenly leap to life and give each other piggy backs. \"Should we rest here a bit?\"\n\nUeslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nThe boys dropped down and started wrestling, which did nothing to stir Maria, who fell asleep in seconds on her backpack. Escobar, splayed on her back, stared at the sky, relating the many reasons that led to her journey.\n\nThe eldest of seven children, she abandoned school and dreams of becoming a detective to help her mother.\n\nLife spiraled down at 18, she said, when on her way to work, a man she knew kidnapped her. She escaped but was pregnant with the child of her rapist, a former policeman who turned out to be a member of Barrio-18, she said. That brutal gang, together with MS-13, dominates much of El Salvador and Honduras.\n\nUeslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nHe disappeared, believed to have been killed, but no one ever found the body, she said.\n\nShe raised his girl and had a son with another man. In time, he fled to the U.S., promising to send for her. Within a year, his sister told her he had married someone else.\n\nFinally, she fell for a mototaxi driver, who fathered Denzel and Adonai. But he began to throw things at her and abuse her and the boys. Then he forced her out of the house she had paid for with money saved from years working as a cook and a seamstress, she said.\n\nUeslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nWhen a neighbor told her about the caravan, she packed fast: a plastic tarp, clothes for the children, some soap. She left her two eldest children with family, hoping to fetch them later.\n\nCoordinators have not said definitively when and where the caravan might reach the U.S. border, saying it will likely fragment as many people decide to stay in Mexico.\n\nEscobar and her family heaved to their feet. Denzel unfolded a discarded pamphlet that workers from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees distributed to the caravan two towns back.\n\nUeslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nTo disperse the convoy, Mexico has offered the Central Americans temporary jobs and identification papers if they submit requests for asylum in the south. But most have rejected the offer.\n\n\"No, no,\" Escobar told her son. \"The United States is better. For everything.\"\n\nAfter six hours, Escobar started hitchhiking.\n\nUeslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nIn Pijijiapan, hundreds had turned the main square into a mix of carnival and refugee camp. The family headed for a warehouse-sized shelter reserved for anyone with children.\n\nA medical aide squeezed iodine on a woman's bleeding foot. People swarmed into the bathroom. Many went for a dip in a river.\n\nIn mid-afternoon, the warehouse was stifling with the crush of bodies. Escobar searched outside and set her plastic tarp under a tree. Two more stops and they would board a northbound freight train known as \u201cLa Bestia\u201d (the Beast), she said.\n\nAll around, adults fell asleep, exhausted.\n\nBut Adonai was sprinting for his third bottle of water. And Denzel was climbing a tree.\n\n\"They're as strong as adults,\" she said.

He talked about the Continental Divide Recreation, Wilderness, and Camp Hale Legacy Act and he talked about the Helicopter Fuel System Safety Act. He talked about how lowering the cost of early childhood education would benefit the state's neediest families and how if his opponent is elected, he will serve as a \"yes-man\" for the president. But Jared Polis didn\u2019t talk about his personal life.\n\nIn a year in which candidates across the country are sharing tales of their health ailments and job layoffs, racial discrimination and childcare struggles, Polis -- who could make history next week as the first openly gay man to win a U.S. gubernatorial election -- is instead deflecting attention away from his potential historical accomplishment and towards the message of inclusivity that has been embraced by his fellow Democrats in the most diverse election cycle in modern memory.\n\n\"I really think that we are at our best as a nation, as a society, when our elected officials are fully representative of the people they're elected to work for,\" Polis told ABC News. \"That means we should have our communities of color represented, women represented, the LGBTQ community represented. And the more diversity we have in elected leadership, responsible positions, I think the better result we'll have.\"\n\nThough he's chosen not to make his sexual orientation a talking point on the campaign trail, Polis' shot at history comes as part of this year's \"rainbow wave,\" an influx of LGBTQ candidates across the country who are running for office.\n\nIn Vermont, Democrat Christine Hallquist is the first transgender woman to be a major party's gubernatorial candidate. Gov. Kate Brown, up for re-election in Oregon, became the first openly bisexual person to serve as a state's governor upon her ascension to the position in 2015. ABC News has identified an additional 22 candidates who identify as members of the LGBTQ community running as the major party nominee in House and Senate races nationwide.\n\nAndy Cross/Denver Post via Getty Images\n\nTo Polis however, already the first openly gay man to be out when first elected to the House of Representatives, such progress is not unusual, at least in his home state.\n\n\"Colorado is a groundbreaking state,\" said Polis. \"We've had LGBT speakers in our state assembly, Senate minority leaders, commissioners.\"\n\nBut as he referenced the various achievements of LGBTQ community members across the state, Polis neglected to mention moments that it did not distinguish itself as progressive. Namely, the 1992 referendum formally called the \"Colorado No Protected Status for Sexual Orientation Amendment.\" The initiative, which was approved by a 53.4 to 46.6 margin stripped legal protection for homosexual, lesbian and bisexual residents on the basis of their sexual orientation. This led Colorado to acquire the nickname, \"The Hate State.\"\n\nThough the result of the 1992 referendum startled the state's LGBT community, it also spurred a call to action that has led to significant developments for the LGBTQ community over the past 25 years.\n\n\"Activism around Amendment 2 really helped, I believe, Colorado become more politically sophisticated and more organized,\" said Rex Fuller, the vice president of communications at the non-profit GLBT Community Center of Colorado in Denver.\n\nFuller linked the amendment's passage to the 1980s AIDS crisis, which disproportionately affected LGBT persons, describing the era as a low-point for the community from which it has gradually recovered. A number of legal advancements since have come in the form of Supreme Court decisions. In 1996, Amendment 2 was thrown out as a result of the decision in Romer v. Evans, the Defense of Marriage Act was struck down via United States v. Windsor in 2013, and 2015's Obergefell v. Hodges decision affirmed the right of same-sex couples to marry.\n\n\"They're the rights that anyone should have under our Constitution,\" Fuller said, explaining that though the LGBT community may appear insular to outsiders, its members should be treated no differently.\n\n\"I think that's always where we've been trying to move. Any minority group wants to enjoy a shared heritage that they share because of shared experiences, but that doesn't govern everything.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court decisions and a broader societal shift towards LGBTQ acceptance have not, however, ended the harassment of the community. Fuller recounted a number of incidents in the past two years in which local LGBT individuals have been hassled because of their sexual orientation, including once by a person wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat. According to Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ civil rights organization, 22 transgender people have died due to fatal violence in 2018. Last year the total was 29, the highest number ever recorded by the organization. https://www.hrc.org/resources/violence-against-the-transgender-community-in-2018\n\nAdditional legal protections for the LGBTQ community are being sought by legislative means, and though community members are optimistic about Colorado's increasingly progressive laws -- those governing marijuana possession and use were among the first of their kind in the country -- LGBTQ advocates have run into roadblocks over the past four years when they attempted to make it easier for transgender people to change their birth certificates and outlaw conversion therapy on LGBTQ minors.\n\nDaniel Ramos, the executive director of One Colorado, an LGBTQ advocacy organization located in Denver, said that while gathering bipartisan support, the both measures failed in recent years in the state's Republican-controlled Senate. In addition to Polis' history-making campaign, Colorado Democrats' top priority this week is to win back that chamber.\n\n\"For the work that we do, we know that the governor can only do so much,\" Ramos said. \"And that the more work we do to change hearts [and] minds in Colorado and across the country around LGBTQ issues is even more important.\"\n\n\"While we may have a pro-equality majority in state legislature and a pro-equality governor, the important work we still need to do is to tell stories and to humanize the impacts of legislation for LGBTQ folks. Having a gay governor doesn't make everything else go away.\"\n\nThough Polis has been a public figure in the state for decades -- prior to his run for the House he was a chairman of the state board of education and a prolific philanthropist -- he has not been immune to attacks on his sexual orientation. The appearance of homophobic bumper stickers against Polis were reported in the town of Eagle, Colorado, and police have located a person of interest, according to Fox's Denver affiliate KDVR.\n\nBut as for his sexual orientation's impact at the polls, the Democrat was adamant that voters are focused on the bigger picture.\n\n\"I think what the people of Colorado care about is: who's going to make my life better?\" Polis said. \"They don't care about who you are and who you love.\"", "Interested in Midterm Elections?

He didn't warn Georgians that their personal information may be compromised. He instead launched politically motivate accusations against his political opponents.\u201d\n\nAbrams, who with a victory on Tuesday would become the first African-American woman to be elected governor in the United States, told ABC News\u2019 affiliate WSB-TV in Atlanta that Kemp was \u201ctrying to distract voters with a desperate ploy.\u201d\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s gubernatorial forecast listed the Georgia race as a \u201ctoss-up,\u201d with both candidates projected to receive just shy of 50 percent of the total vote.

Just days after the 2016 presidential election, Kemp requested a federal investigation by the Department of Homeland Security, citing 10 suspected unauthorized attempts by DHS personnel to penetrate the state\u2019s firewall.\n\nA report from the Inspector General of DHS released in July 2017, concluded that allegations were unsubstantiated. The investigation determined that the activity flagged by Kemp was the \u201cresult of normal and automatic computer message exchanges,\u201d and that there were no unauthorized intrusion attempts.\n\nVoting rights have been a central issue in the campaign over the past several months, and Kemp has resisted calls, including from former President Jimmy Carter, to recuse himself from overseeing an election in which he is running.\n\nKemp\u2019s office has been under fire for weeks after an investigation by the Associated Press found that more than 50,000 registrations, the vast majority from African-American voters, had been put on hold because data in their voter registration applications did not exactly match other government records.\n\nBob Andres/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP\n\nCivil rights\u2019 groups have sued Kemp over that so-called \u201cexact-match\u201d law and over allegations that hundreds of absentee ballot were tossed after election workers determined that the signatures on the ballot applications did not match those on file. Federal judges ruled against Kemp in both instances.\n\n\u201cHe twice this week was told by federal judges that he was wrong when it comes to voter suppression,\u201d Abrams said Sunday. \u201cThey forced him to restore access to the right to vote for those who are casting absentee ballots and those who on the exact match list. He is trying to rile up his base by misleading voters yet again.\"\n\nKevin D.

A lot of people right now are hungry,\" Cano told ABC News.\n\nAs Cano spoke, a chaotic scene was unfolding nearby with hundreds of migrants cramming onto a truck. The driver was still deciding whether to take them after a humanitarian group told him he should not be charging the desperate people for rides.\n\nCano said he used to live in New York City and hoped to one day get back there.

That's not for us, folks,\" Trump said at a campaign rally in Florida on Saturday. \"They have to come in legally. They have to come in absolutely through a process and they have to come in through merit so they can help all the companies moving back to Florida and the United States.\"\n\nABC News\n\nHe has described those traveling in the caravan as violent criminals, among whom he says could include Middle Eastern terrorists.\n\nTrump has pledged to send up to 15,000 troops to the border in response to the slow-moving migrant caravan.\n\nThe Pentagon said more than 3,500 troops have been deployed to staging bases along the border, including about 1,000 Marines in California. Still, there were only about 100 troops at the border as of Friday, working at and near a bridge leading to McAllen, Texas, the Rio Grande Valley's second-biggest city, with a population of about 140,000.\n\n\"Donald Trump is saying that everybody in here they're violent. That is not true,\" Rafael Garcia of Guatemala told ABC News Sunday morning. \"This is all propaganda for his campaigns. It's all political what he's doing and that's not right what he's doing. He should be ashamed of himself for saying that.\"\n\nTrump has frequently cited a violent scene that occurred on Oct. 20 when thousands of Central American migrants forced their way across a bridge at the Guatemala-Mexico border and pushed through a fence, overwhelming Mexican riot police, who responded by firing rubber bullets and tear gas. Some in the group, according to Trump, threw rocks at the police.\n\nGarcia is traveling with his two daughters, one 13 years old and the other 14 months old. He said Trump's rhetoric has discouraged him from traveling to the United States.\n\nMarcus Moore/ABC News\n\nInstead, he said he plans to go to Mexico City, where people have promised him shelter and a job.\n\nGarcia said he used to live in the United States, and spent about 35 years in Los Angeles before he was deported when he was cited for driving under the influence.\n\nIn Guatemala, Garcia said he started a small business.\n\n\"I had a good little business and I was being extorted by criminals sent by police, corrupted police,\" he said. \"I was paying them but they kept on asking me for more and more and after that, I couldn't give them more, so they killed my wife. They shot my wife six times in the face and then they started telling me that if I wasn't going to cooperate still that my daughter was going to be next. So, when I heard about the caravan I decided we have to take off.\"\n\nHe said many of the migrants, who have been traveling since early October, have left the caravan and returned to their homes because of Trump's decision to send soldiers to the border.\n\n\"These people [migrants] think that they\u2019re going to get over there and the soldiers are going to start shooting at them,\" Garcia said. \"That's what the government in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador do.\"\n\nAnother migrant, Nelmy Ponce said she, too, has a message for Trump.\n\n\"I want to send a message to Donald Trump and ask him to soften his heart,\" Ponce told ABC News in Spanish during an interview near Isla municipality in the port city of Veracruz.\n\nABC News\n\n\"I will want to work,\" she continued. \"Give us permission to enter the country, because we are not delinquent.

Add Health Care Overhaul as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Health Care Overhaul news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nVoters this year have told pollsters in no uncertain terms that health care is important to them. In particular, maintaining insurance protections for preexisting conditions is the top issue to many.\n\nBut the results of the midterm elections are likely to have a major impact on a broad array of other health issues that touch every single American. And how those issues are addressed will depend in large part on which party controls the U.S. House and Senate, governors\u2019 mansions and state legislatures around the country.\n\nAll politics is local, and no single race is likely to determine national or even state action. But some key contests can provide something of a barometer of what\u2019s likely to happen \u2014 or not happen \u2014 over the next two years.\n\nFor example, keep an eye on Kansas. The razor-tight race for governor could determine whether the state expands Medicaid to all people with low incomes, as allowed under the Affordable Care Act. The legislature in that deep red state passed a bill to accept expansion in 2017, but it could not override the veto of then-Gov. Sam Brownback. Of the candidates running for governor in 2018, Democrat Laura Kelly supports expansion, while Republican Kris Kobach does not.\n\nHere are three big health issues that could be dramatically affected by Tuesday\u2019s vote.\n\n1. The Affordable Care Act\n\nProtections for preexisting conditions are only a small part of the ACA. The law also made big changes to Medicare and Medicaid, employer-provided health plans and the generic drug approval process, among other things.\n\nRepublicans ran hard on promises to get rid of the law in every election since it passed in 2010. But when the GOP finally got control of the House, the Senate and the White House in 2017, Republicans found they could not reach agreement on how to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the law.\n\nThis year has Democrats on the attack over the votes Republicans took on various proposals to remake the health law. Probably the most endangered Democrat in the Senate, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, has hammered her Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer, over his votes in the House for the unsuccessful repeal-and-replace bills. Cramer said that despite his votes he supports protections for preexisting conditions, but he has not said what he would do or get behind that could have that effect.\n\nPolls suggest Cramer has a healthy lead in that race, but if Heitkamp pulled off a surprise win, health care might well get some of the credit.\n\nAnd in New Jersey, Rep. Tom MacArthur, the moderate Republican who wrote the language that got the GOP health bill passed in the House in 2017, is in a heated race with Democrat Andy Kim, who has never held elective office. The overriding issue in that race, too, is health care.\n\nIt is not just congressional action that has Republicans playing defense on the ACA. In February, 18 GOP attorneys general and two GOP governors filed a lawsuit seeking a judgment that the law is now unconstitutional because Congress in the 2017 tax bill repealed the penalty for not having insurance. Two of those attorneys general \u2014 Missouri\u2019s Josh Hawley and West Virginia\u2019s Patrick Morrisey \u2014 are running for the Senate. Both states overwhelmingly supported President Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nThe attorneys general are running against Democratic incumbents \u2014 Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. And both Republicans are being hotly criticized by their opponents for their participation in the lawsuit.\n\nAlthough Manchin appears to have taken a lead, the Hawley-McCaskill race is rated a toss-up by political analysts.\n\nBut in the end the fate of the ACA depends less on an individual race than on which party winds up in control of Congress.\n\n\u201cIf Democrats take the House \u2026 then any attempt at repeal-and-replace will be kaput,\u201d said John McDonough, a former Democratic Senate aide who helped write the ACA and now teaches at the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nConservative health care strategist Chris Jacobs, who worked for Republicans on Capitol Hill, said a new repeal-and-replace effort might not happen even if Republicans are successful Tuesday.\n\n\u201cRepublicans, if they maintain the majority in the House, will have a margin of a half dozen seats \u2014 if they are lucky,\u201d he said. That likely would not allow the party to push through another controversial effort to change the law. Currently there are 42 more Republicans than Democrats in the House. Even so, the GOP barely got its health bill passed out of the House in 2017.\n\nAnd political strategists say that, when the dust clears after voting, the numbers in the Senate may not be much different so change could be hard there too. Republicans, even with a small majority last year, could not pass a repeal bill there.\n\n2. Medicaid expansion\n\nThe Supreme Court in 2012 made optional the ACA\u2019s expansion of Medicaid to cover all low-income Americans up to 138 percent of the poverty line ($16,753 for an individual in 2018). Most states have now expanded, particularly since the federal government is paying the vast majority of the cost: 94 percent in 2018, gradually dropping to 90 percent in 2020.\n\nStill, 17 states, all with GOP governors or state legislatures (or both), have yet to expand Medicaid.\n\nMcDonough is confident that\u2019s about to change. \u201cI\u2019m wondering if we\u2019re on the cusp of a Medicaid wave,\u201d he said.\n\nFour states \u2014 Nebraska, Idaho, Utah and Montana \u2014 have Medicaid expansion questions on their ballots. All but Montana have yet to expand the program. Montana\u2019s question would eliminate the 2019 sunset date included in its expansion in 2016. But it will be interesting to watch results because the measure has run into big-pocketed opposition: the tobacco industry. The initiative would increase taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products to fund the state\u2019s increased Medicaid costs.\n\nIn Idaho, the ballot measure is being embraced by a number of Republican leaders. GOP Gov. Butch Otter, who is retiring after three terms, endorsed it Tuesday.\n\nBut the issue is in play in other states, too. Several non-expansion states have close or closer-than-expected races for governor where the Democrat has made Medicaid expansion a priority.\n\nIn Florida, one of the largest states not to have expanded expanded Medicaid, the Republican candidate for governor, former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, opposes expansion. His Democratic opponent, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, supports it.\n\nIn Georgia, the gubernatorial candidates, Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp, also are on opposite sides of the Medicaid expansion debate.\n\nHowever, the legislatures in both states have opposed the expansion, and it\u2019s not clear if they would be swayed by arguments from a new governor.\n\n3. Medicare\n\nUntil recently, Republicans have remained relatively quiet about efforts to change the popular Medicare program for seniors and people with disabilities.\n\nTheir new talking point is that proposals to expand the program \u2014 such as the often touted \u201cMedicare-for-all,\u201d which an increasing number of Democrats are embracing \u2014 could threaten the existing program.\n\n\u201cMedicare is at significant risk of being cut if Democrats take over the House,\u201d Rep. Greg Gianforte (R-Mont.) told the Lee Montana Newspapers. \u201cMedicare-for-all is Medicare for none. It will gut Medicare, end the VA as we know it, and force Montana seniors to the back of the line.\u201d\n\nGianforte\u2019s Democratic opponent, Kathleen Williams, is proposing another idea popular with Democrats: allowing people age 55 and over to \u201cbuy into\u201d Medicare coverage. That race, too, is very tight.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Washington, congressional Republicans are more concerned with how Medicare and other large government social programs are threatening the budget.\n\n\u201cSooner or later we are going to run out of other people\u2019s money,\u201d said Chris Jacobs.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested in an Oct. 16 interview with Bloomberg News that entitlement programs like Medicare are \u201cthe real driver of the debt by any objective standard,\u201d but that bipartisan cooperation will be needed to address that problem\n\nRepublican Jacobs and Democrat McDonough think that\u2019s unlikely any time soon.\n\n\u201cWhy would Democrats give that up as an issue heading into 2020?\u201d asked McDonough, especially because Republicans in recent years have been proposing deep cuts to the Medicare program.\n\nAgreed Jacobs, \u201cTrump may not want that to be the centerpiece of a re-election campaign.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

These are places that, frankly...the border separates them, but for many purposes, these are essentially almost one community,\u201d she told Teen Vogue earlier this year.\n\nOrtiz Jones was one of at least 50 women who ran for office in Texas this year. The openly-gay, Iraq War veteran told ABC News that nobody should be surprised by the increase in female candidates this year.\n\n\u201cThey have stepped up and said, \u2018You know what? I'm done assuming somebody is going to do for me that which I can do for myself',\u201d Ortiz Jones said.\n\nShe worked for the Trump administration as a director in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, but left that position, and decided to run as a Democrat after watching the president\u2019s actions she viewed as harmful to women and minority groups.\n\n\u201cThe type of people that were brought in to be public servants were interested in neither the public nor the service,\u201d she said in an interview with The Huffington Post. \u201cThat, to me, was a sign that I\u2019m going to have to serve in a different way.\u201d\n\nGreat day to kick off a canvass!

The Democrats need for Nancy Pelosi to be guaranteed she'll be the speaker first of all this policy is probably one of the best whip commas in the Democratic Caucus so. I wouldn't. Still hot under the bus right now because she knows how to win she's raise Obama 130 million dollars for Democrats across the country. When a reasons why we have a diverse lineup of candidates is because Nancy Pelosi went out there and encouraged those candidates to run so I see Nancy Pelosi I mean she's gonna fight like hell. There is a call for new blood more people in the leadership and just remember towards fifteen to 25% of those newly elected Democrats. They will look for someone who can carried a mammal for them in 20/20 and beyond and Chris for the White House the house and subpoena powers and. Brand new ball game but it is the White House brace for that are they ready for are they prepared well to give the new White House counsel. Who knew should be in place in time. For January and you know if it's his democratic house it's very well could be their main job is to be do it via subpoena processor over the White House and I think. Mary was right there that there is real political risk in that as well we saw that happen with who the Republican House and Bill Clinton. In the ninety's. You know if you go too aggressive in that regard it to be a backlash against those people so. I've that's why figure but what every car my pocket if they when the house if you poses to be speaker. Sharpest elbows best counter she is going to be the speaker every health and pretend. We are all going to be here on teasing I wanna get everybody's taken with a can be watching for Martha let me start with you what's the big to do Washington's. I think I didn't even going beyond Tuesday night I think one of the things you watched Tuesday night is not whether the Democrats gain control of the house but it's also how people campaign. And what this is meant about these incendiary ads. That's a lesson that everybody will learn going forward not just to 20/20 but beyond its isn't this the kind of fear mongering that works. If he does you'll see a lot more about two Carl. I'll be watching Pennsylvania polls close at 8 o'clock so we'll see relatively early troop won the state but 44000 votes it was a key reason that he is president. And the depth and the Republicans could lose. Up to eight seats in the state of Pennsylvania there are almost certain to lose too because of redistricting. How they do between that Marsha that will determine largely where we don't run. House I got my eyes on the suburbs other on this country looking at places like the seventh congressional district in Virginia where you've got a female newcomer Abigail spam burger. Running and looking to unseat a third term Republican there. Will there be a so called pink way with someone like this ushering out a trumps supporter in in a trunk district we will see. Matthew down. I'm watching independence from aunt and that's gonna determine who wins this and all of the races across the country why Donald Trump's pres United States and specific race I think people should be aware up. Is the petrol Rourke take crews race in Texas that raises a lot closer than people think and I talked to a number Republicans over the last 48 hours. They're very concerned the first time they've been concerned that they can possibly lose a statewide race in Texas. In twenties is an opportunity to talk about the early but just saw this come in overnight already. More people who voted in the state of Texas what it was two days out from the vote the vote in the entire record as the fourteenth and they're thinking that there's going to be more than seven million people vote in this election in Texas which is almost a presidential year election return. And most of the growth announced as host and as new people. Young people and Latino federal work wins in Texas he's automatically near the food. Top of the pack for 221 he's already a rock star he becomes the biggest rock star in the country Tarver. Of course some direct or for a fact I'm watching Georgia at some Ahmad his daughter the south I'm very proud of Stacy Abrams laconic campaign. That she's run she's innocent but camping on education I wanna see how when I wanna see a win decisively and I'm also watch and the other states as well including Florida. There's another visit and another race in Georgia though if if Stacey Abrams as well for so we should say that if neither she nor Brian can get 50% there's a runoff that's around me in the seat of Georgia secondly. Does she have the strength to carry loosened that and other key senate race I think so if you look how stressful absolutely look. She has done something that I think Democrats should have done long time ago. That is she's expanded the electorate she has campaigned in rural areas like Doug Wilder who won back in 1989. Stacey Abrams understood that an audit so when you had to bring a new energy and a part of and she's done that. Florida Wisconsin a six have before to be key to watch. And I'm who's had a good night the bad guy from the party's. If you see the Oklahoma governor should go to the Democrats it's going to be a very bad night for Republicans. If you see the United States senate seat New Jersey go to the Republicans it's going to be a very bad night for senate Democrats. And it needs so we can be adjusting your forecast all through the evening as we get real results. Coming in give us a sense of which are going to be keep TV night and early in the night. So to meet you have a two part election in the north and the south. We expect that Democrats are gonna gain a lot of seats here in the North Easton Pennsylvania for example we expect they'll do very well in governorships in them in the midwest. If they're gonna have a really good night. We're really put the senate in play they're gonna have to win place in the south are gonna have to win. Tennessee or Texas at least one of those provident have to hold in Florida to have to put these suburban Atlanta districts in play in the house that's when you get a marketing might win. 35 or forty or the senate might actually get increasing and might be because of a race like Texas. Rick Klein you're going to be behind the scenes on on teasing and we've always are trying to learn lessons of the last a couple of changes in forecasts on teasing as we cover. The race is on T save had some bad exit polls 2004. Election 2016. As well talk about how we're gonna communicate with voters arrested during the night and end with our decision desk. We don't know what we don't know and we're gonna be as transparent as possible about why we're not comfortable or particular race we're gonna from provide information throughout the night. About where voters still outstanding we're things look relying on everyone here on the set and beyond to try to convey the true uncertainty in unprecedented election. John Carney said several times we have to be prepared to be surprised Tuesday. Yeah I it will be surprised if I'm not surprised George at and I concede getting to teen age range of events I can see us being surprised by a much bigger. Blue wave been thinking we've anticipated I could I would also. Not be surprised if we see the Republicans did surprisingly well we we just don't know what's so much harder. To poll in in a mid term election so much harder to poll in these house races we just don't know and the intensity is so high.

First term GOP representative Brian it's Patrick. Is in and knock down fight with the democratic challenger Scott Wallace it's one of the most expensive house races in the country. Outside groups. Pouring in millions on the airwaves with his critical tossup contest that's not just radical it's dangerous and that Scott Wallace. After a debate last week in Bucks County just north of Philadelphia. We spoke with both candidates. It's Patrick a rare GOP moderate says he understands why the races so close. Now it's a swing districts and that's why I love represented this district to see how important it is for our communities here. That we had that. Not a representation. To presenting mater constituencies the president says C a vote for Republicans to vote for him but I disagree. I disagree it's always a choice between candidates. And I'm ranked number one most independent nations you have to have a centrist check that's gonna take on their own party and take on. He's the opposite party that's what you need and president president. Depends on one issue and I'm not proud of this ability or lack thereof I think the love this the tone is whose terrible and I don't support that has spoken out against it. Scott Wallace is counting on a surge from Democrats looking to turn act as president trump. Congressman Patrick says he does not think this election is about president try to you. Yes I get a lot of trump fatigue they come out sick can we please stop the nonsense stop the partisanship stop the hatred stopped intolerance but does that really green. The what brings me what brings people you. Does every. Know what brings people is an agenda about we're gonna take care of health care. Student loan debt doing something about climate change doing something about guns I am out there every day we've got to win this race. This is the epicenter of the battle for the house.

On main street at the cotton adults covered ABC news gathered a group of voters from the wealthy predominantly. White suburbs here. That will be key to the Pennsylvania first district race. We spoke with him days before the mash shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. As law enforcement was still on a nationwide manhunt for the person responsible. For mailing over a dozen improvised explosive devices to prominent critics of president trump. Doug Marshall voted for President Obama twice that he switched sides in 2016. And is now an ardent. True supporter I'm concerned of the house. A Democrat takeover of the house. I'm Mike I just see a lot of the vice witness on that side the aisle and monitor talk about. Impeachment. Of the president swore revisiting the issue of wreck happened on impeaching him. It just sounds like pandemonium. I'm concerned about the Democrat party seems to have commandeered off the tracks of the radical left. And you have been satisfied with president terms for. I haven't really appreciated. Some of these tweets quite frankly I think you've been somewhat divisive. At the same time you can it in the war. Is that the economy has been booming unemployment is at historic low lose my happy with everything go. No but. On balance this. During Dugan is a Democrat but supports the bipartisan problem solvers cockpits. Which pits Patrick is a member off congress. For me. This divide it's going on in this country has got to stop we have got to find. Solutions to. I'm listening to different opinions and being able to respect them and I wanna see there can be. People talking to each other across the aisles and if you have extremists the fire in the belly liberals over here and a fire in the valley conservatives over here. If you can't push them this way. And have them come here it's just gonna continue to go this way and it will just be more extremist there are many people who would say. But way and it. If you vote for Fitz Patrick there is a chance that it will be all Republicans again so how does that change. I will say that my whole life I've always perspective people on both sides I do not respect from. But I do respect my local congressman. Independent might do Mino says his vote for Democrat Scott Wallace is all about a opposing president trump. This was the harvest alerts in for me to meet this is gone but because. Found competent devices newspapers. Needed terrorist support for an. Selection so usually. We'll vote vote Democrat Republican here the sizable ones and automated case. Decisions but this time it was just take you about for Democrats. They can hold a contract. And and what isn't you who just when you with don't like whatever it is about prison term serve as a follower of two young girls I can't see him. Tweeting and being a role model for them and us. That behavior does things it is goats liberal Democrat unit which Zia says she is also hoping for democratic takeover. I know that are present it is Patrick is very effective in a lot of ways but he's not effective and putting a shark on what's going on in the executive branch can you tell me the Democrats messages initially. At it very clear I think that. Dark and found it concerned about voter rights and immigrant rights and minority rights. We're at the administration seems to be rolling trying attempting to Rowling goes right back. And I think though the strongest party on. Our health care issues. I know there are concerned. About the environment whereas the administration has been rolling back environmental standards. If I may is is civility and issue because what you said about your daughters was the first thing you said to me so is that. A motivated her to. That's a big motivated as well. If you see able you know stand up to the oval leaders thinkers and keep going I think. With. Donald Thompson supposed beats there. It's just pulling 11 game here. What would you say about does that not matter I agree with the idea with the concept the stability. But I I just don't see civility. Coming into play. If if that I if something is I don't see the current Democrat party as a civil parties are really. They are the party in my opinion. That is advocating violence. There of the party which is attacking. People with opinions foreign to their own. And you don't think that's happening with the president the Republican politicians. In Washington. Are not encouraging Republicans to act that way you've got people you know what confronting. Republicans restaurants and airports and. As we sit here as we sit here and we have no idea. Who did this but there were. Mail bombs sent out addressed to. People who have criticized the president who he has criticized. And he he he stands up and says it's great if your body slam reporter he calls. The press the enemy of the people. Well I don't believe the president has ever come out and says he's against the First Amendment or the press. He has attacked what he calls fake news and the fake news media. And in my opinion the fake. News media whatever you want a quote the mainstream media is unquestionably. Hissing when most dangerous weapon. In this country because it's dividing this country. I will say that. I think the way the president speaks about certain. Groups in this country. On op hall and I'm angered and I just feel like. It's gone way beyond what. What I want my children to be seeing I just have to say that the violence that you tied to the Democratic Party I just absolutely have to say totally disagree with. I don't know what you I thought I'd totally disagree with that as well Haitian gave. I. An ethical and morrow example. And you that's not fair. Violence begets more violence language that using baby gets more language I believe that our tribes look for the news me.

She was transferred to the Brunswick County Sheriff's Department and her bond was set at $500.\n\nWestwood was caught on video on Oct. 19 berating sisters Leisa Meria Garris, 52, and Mary Michelle Garris, 49, while they were waiting for AAA to arrive in the parking lot for the Camden Fairview Apartments in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m white and I\u2019m hot.

Van Hollen: Dems have 'narrow path to a majority' despite difficult Senate map\n\nNow we're gonna bring in the chair the democratic senate campaign committee senator Chris van Holland Merrell center that Hong thanks for joining us this morning is turn to predictions there Toronto McDaniel it is true. The year democratic senators are up against the wall on TJ you. Are you confident. That you can take the senate. What George inside great to be with few here's where we are we have lots of races within the margin of error son back in and make any. Predictions what I can say is that as you discussed earlier on this program. Senate Democrats really face the toughest political map in sixty years so it's remarkable that weren't as strong a position as we are. And that is a testament to our senators and to our senate democratic candidates. Who were running as candidates or we're gonna stand up for there are states that their job. Is to put politics aside stand up for their states sometimes that means working with president trump if it's good for their state. As sometimes it means opposing the president that's bad for their state like the president's effort Republican effort to take away protections for people with. Preexisting health conditions a big issue in. All these races in bid that is a big issue in all these cases you have seen as you said your democratic senator Brian Donnelly and in Indiana is advertising about how much he supporting president trump I I can't. In North Dakota has done the same thing. But seems to be especially high camp in North Dakota punished for the Kavanagh nomination how Democrats handle the kind Kavanagh nomination any regrets. Well first of all never I count Heidi hi camp out in her last election six years ago she was ten points down with a week to go. It's much closer than that in North Dakota don't count her out. The reality is that Heidi hide camp and did as she always does what she thought was the best thing. For the country sometimes that means supporting the president on issues as she did with the earlier justice side gore such and sometimes that means opposing. The president on these issues health. Well Bob Menendez in new juries listen it's a race we haven't talked too much about of course he was indicted later acquitted. And on corruption issues but he has he does seem to be in a tighter race in New Jersey and you would expect. Are you confident he's gonna pull it out are you concerned that he may be holding back. Democratic house candidates. I'm actually confident that among Bob Menendez is will win that race the people of New Jersey have been very clear. They do not want a rubber stamp for Donald trawl and that is what. Bob Menendez is opponent is that has done. And will do and his opponent has spent thirty million dollars of of money that he gained as the CEO or form from pharmaceutical company. Where he really gal edged prices for cancer patients so. That's why you have a competitive race in New Jersey obviously there are other issues Bob Menendez has to litigate but. People of New Jersey do not want to Donald Trump rubber stamp. Democrats hoping they can pick up seats in Nevada and Arizona one of the big X factors there is will look Tina's turn out to vote. Will that. Yes they well and wordy see in their early voting results in those states and you are seeing a good health the up turnout among. Latino voters as well as younger voters in your seeing a pattern. Of good turnout for Democrats and independence. Who were supporting democratic candidates. Around the country George and again. That issue that has been front and center for the last two years the Republican efforts to. Take away important health care protections. That is one that senate Republican candidates. Have been running away from their records on and we're making sure. That people know exactly what they they did which was a vote either in the congress the senate. Or through lawsuits to take away those protections for people with preexisting conditions and I'll also say that the Republican senate leader's comments the other day. About the Republican plan to cut Medicare and Social Security. It gives away there they're playbook that the debt went way up to two trillion dollars as a result of the tax cut for big corporations now they wanna come back. And take it out on people who have Medicare and Social Security you prepare for world Wednesday were Republicans pick up seats in the senate. And George were were prepared for whatever result we have but let me just say that the fact that we still have a narrow path. Two majority is a sea change from a where we were eighteen months ago and as I said it's 'cause our candidates have always said. They'll stand up for their states first and foremost put aside the politics do what's right. And were seen the results here these are some very close races and of course there in states that Donald Trump one. Big and it's a testament to these candidates that they're so focused on what matters to people in her state when it comes to health care. That is not a top down issue it's not like you know president trump going out there and talking about immigration. Try to divide people and by the way. We've just seen a litany of documented false statements and lies from the president. On that issue. But on the health care issue this is a bottom up issue when Republicans. I tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act you've found people in rural areas and rural hospitals say no you found. The American Cancer Society the American Diabetes Association all these local chapters who had nothing to do with politics said. Don't take away our protections for health care and yet Republicans continue to try to do that senator Kristen Holland and much thank you.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Transcript for RNC chair: 'Obviously we have headwinds' but GOP can keep House, Senate majorities\n\nJoined now by the chair of the Republican National Committee Rodham again erotic thank you for joining us this morning unusually subdued president there almost resigned it seems. Two losing their house or you. Absolutely not. I especially with the economic numbers that we stop. On Friday it went. That 250000 jobs added to the economy with wages over 3% for the first time in a decade I mean the American voters are looking. At what happened over the past two years they're making more money more jobs are coming back that is a great closing argument in a lot of these house races that are within the margin of error. And they're gonna say Republicans that have offered a record of results and Democrats are offering resistance and going back east they disagree Claire you say it's a great closing argument knock on the president's not making. He has he's talking about many different things that he's accomplished as president because the list is cell line. I think he's highlighting the fact that we need immigration. Reform Democrats are coming to the table on that ought to strengthening our military taking care for our back trends take an OPEC crisis. And the national security issues that he's. Take a nine North Korea I ran Syria out all the things that. He's accomplished in these first years but the economy is a driving force with the tax cuts and the deregulation and people's lives are battered they're taking home more money to spend on their families and that is a very compelling argument for many of these voters across the country. Who are looking at who they want to keep in the majority and Republicans the party that's deliver. So Lisa you wondering you want voters focused on the economy on Tuesday the president every single day over the last week is talked about immigration talking about sending troops talking but the migrant care event talking about birthright. Citizenship even tweeting out that at we're not gonna play the whole lever to show. That ad the president put out about illegal immigration showing that illegal. Immigrant who commit a murder bringing that. On Democrats that's caused even some Republicans. C react John Kasich Republican governor. Of Ohio they're tweeted out the politics of fear hatred and division should have no place in our country or the Republican Party let alone the presidency. All Americans should reject this ad and its motives do you. I think the president's highlighting I have failure in our immigration system that this disgusting person got into our country twice under Democrat and a Republican president. He labeled only Democrats we don't want that in our immigration system obviously we recognize that we have a broken immigration. The policy right now in this country with these caravans coming towards our country with 121000 kids that have come unaccompanied that are coming on their own because their parents so desperately want to get into this country I know why they want to get here. Our economy's doing great we have a lot of jobs. And the president has said let's get merit based immigration let's focus on eliminating the visa lottery system something that Canada's it doesn't do. And let's strengthen our border and Democrats again walk under the table on an important issue like immigration they didn't come to the table on the east tax cuts. Stating come to Vickie table at this president on anything because they've refused to work with him. And he's closing with the argument of we are the party of results and they're the party of resistance. There's division in the Republican party of course an immigration as well but you're not concerned about that the possibility as we were talking matches earlier in the program. That the president's focus on immigration the ads like that are gonna cause a backlash in suburban districts you need to hold. In order to hold the house. I'm with the president at these rallies the president's talking about all of the accomplishments I think the media is focusing on immigration constantly and I get that. But he's focusing on the economy he's talking about the jobs he's talking about the lowest unemployment in history for the African American and Hispanic communities. And that our country is on a great comeback and the fact that Nancy Pelosi has said she's gonna raise taxes. And the president recognizes the historical trends. With the house and the senate usually the party that holds the White House loses three seats in the senate and thirty seats in the house and he's doing everything he candid turn out every about. With his exhaustive schedule. But is a whole variety of issues that he's talking about an accomplishment that he's made. As president that have made our country stronger more prosperous safe are. I'm and has given the American people more jobs more money. And a comeback that frankly a lot of Democrats didn't think was possible they certainly didn't help what. They've charity or do you blame you blame the media but it's the president himself from city wants election to be about the caravan. The press has not said he wanted to be just about the caravan the president saying let's look at the record are you better off than you were two years the Al he's talking about the economy. It's just not getting that same coverage mean the economy should be for first and foremost and a lot of people's minds as they're going to the polls because remember. President Obama said will never get about 2% GDP. And now where at 3.5. Percent GDP over 4% in some cases we've seen at four million people call off of food stamps we've seen four million new jobs come to this country. There's a lot of good things to talk about the president's talking about a stunt man a lot of other things. You know he can walk and chew gum at the same time we're to the house and senate stand Wednesday morning. It's tight. George it's tight it's gonna depend on voter turnout on Election Day and Democrat enthusiasm is definitely there we are seeing that an early voting. It and qualities that key house and senate races and Republicans have been matching so. Literally Election Day voting it's gonna determine the balance of the house it's a there's about 27 seats within the margin of air obviously. We have had hit had winds with 44 retirements and historical trends. On the house but I feel like we can still keep that majority and then the senate is a batter map. And if we keep the senate that will be defying history as well because usually you lose three seats and that first term of first term president on the Daniel thanks very much.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "\"I fight on because that is what you told me I had to do,\" she wrote.", "The son and daughter of a woman who mysteriously died aboard a cruise ship speak out exclusively to ABC News.", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "The son and daughter of a woman who mysteriously died aboard a cruise ship speak out exclusively to ABC News.", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "Stocks are closing sharply lower on Wall Street, pulled down by more steep losses in big technology companies.

Welcome to a special edition of This Week.\n\nThe race to finish. 48 hours to go.\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is one of the most important elections of our entire lives.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: The closing arguments.\n\nMARTHA MCSALLY, ARIZONA SENATE CANDIDATE: We have to crack down on sanctuary cities.\n\nBETO O\u2019ROURKE, TEXAS SENATE CANDIDATE: Stop the walls of separation.\n\nSTACEY ABRAMS, GEORGIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: Georgia can do more, can be more.\n\nJOSH HAWLEY, MISSOURI SENATE CANDIDATE: Everything that you voted for is on the line.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Political star power.\n\nBARACK OBAMA, 44TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You can vote for a politics that's decent, for a politics that's honest, for a politics that is lawful.\n\nTRUMP: The choice in this election could not be more simple.\n\nOPRAH WINFREY, MEDIA MOGUL: You all are on the very precipice of an historical election.\n\nBOB KNIGHT, FORMER INDIANA UNIVERSITY HOOSIERS BASKETBALL COACH: Go get him, Donald.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And white-hot rhetoric.\n\nTRUMP: If you don't want America to be overrun by masses of illegal aliens and giant caravans, you better vote Republican.\n\nJOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Let's make it clear, we Democrats, we choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Republicans banking on the economy and the Kavanaugh effect, Democrats campaigning to check Trump and preserve health care.\n\nAmericans already voting in record numbers, control of Congress, the Trump presidency, our country's future all at stake.\n\nThis morning, we cover it all, our election team standing by with the races to watch. Plus our brand-new poll and the latest election forecast from FiveThirtyEight.\n\nANNOUNCER: From ABC News election headquarters it's This Week. Here now, chief anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Hello, again. You can see that we are broadcasting this morning from our election headquarters here in New York. This is where we're going to be tracking and analyzing results as they come in on Tuesday night. The team already here, ready to go for what is shaping up to be the most consequential midterm election in years.\n\nIt feels like a presidential election. Americans are engaged. Passions high. Early voting through the roof and President Trump is campaigning as if he were on the ballot.\n\nIn one way he is. If Democrats win the House or the Senate Tuesday night, Trump will wake up to a very different presidency Wednesday morning.\n\nOur brand-new ABC News/Washington Post poll shows the president coming into these midterms with the lowest approval of any president since Harry Truman. He's at 40 percent, with 53 percent disapproving of Trump's performance.\n\nThe president's average approval since inauguration is the lowest on record. And 59 percent of likely voters say it's important to them to vote for a candidate who shares their opinion of Trump. That is fueling a Democratic advantage with 48 hours to go. Democratic House candidates lead Republicans by 8 points among likely voters, 52 to 44. But that is down from 13 points last month.\n\nThe Republican base is clearly re-energized in the wake of the Kavanaugh hearings and the Democratic advantage among women, especially independent women, is shrinking.\n\nOn the issues, Republicans have an edge on handling the economy. Democrats have been advertising on health care, they have an advantage there. And as President Trump trains his fire on that migrant caravan, our poll shows split views -- 47 percent trust Democrats to handle immigration, but voters trust Republicans by a 10-point margin on border security.\n\nWe have a lot to analyze here with our team. I want to start by bringing our chief national affairs correspondent Tom Llamas. Tom, we're going to be focusing Tuesday on two key numbers, the two numbers we show right there, 23 and 2.\n\nThe House changes hands if the Democrats pick up 23 seats. In the Senate Democrats would need a net gain of two seats to change control. And those races you are going to show are taking place on two very different battlegrounds. Let's start with the House.\n\nTOM LLAMAS, ABC NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: That's right, George. So, we're tracking the House races, but we've identified more than 100 competitive House races. These are the congressional districts, and you can see they stretch all along the map.\n\nWhat are we seeing here? We're seeing congressional districts that are part of suburbs and exurbs. And we see some clusters in the northeast. We're watching New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, Virginia, but we're also watching some red states -- Kentucky, Kansas, Texas, and in the blue state of California, we're tracking nearly a dozen races.\n\nWe have taken all these the competitive races. And we've aligned them like this on what we're calling our chip board, align them by the way polls are closing.\n\nRemember that key number you were talking about, George, 23, that's how many seats Democrats have to flip. And they may have an advantage. Historically, we have never seen a Democratic battleground this big. And there's a couple of reasons, a quarter of these districts, Hillary Clinton actually won but Republicans hold power. In others, Republicans were retired and even more, Democrats are generally excited about their candidates, George.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: The Senate exactly the opposite.\n\nLLAMAS: A completely different story in the Senate. Let's talk a look at that now. When we flip over to our battleground board over here and we take a look at all the blue, these are all the Democratic seats. We're tracking 35 races. Let's go to the map right now. These are all the Senate races. But we've identified 14 key races.\n\nRemember, George, as you said, the Republicans have an advantage of two seats here but there are a lot of seats that Democrats hold in Missouri, Indiana and North Dakota. This was Trump country and they have a Democratic senator. But there are some races where Democrats feel they may have an advantage because of Republican retirements, in Tennessee and Arizona. We\u2019re going to be watching all those, George.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Lot of seats to watch. Want to bring in Nate Silver, also from FiveThirtyEight. And Nate, your forecast looking ahead to Tuesday pretty much mirror what we\u2019re seeing on those maps. Let\u2019s start with the House.\n\nNATE SILVER, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, FIVETHIRTYEIGHT: Yeah, for sure. So look at who is playing defense and how much defense they\u2019re playing. So in the House we have Democrats with about a four in five chance of winning the House. The national polls are pretty good for Democrats. The district polls are -- are very good for Democrats. They\u2019re pretty deep into red territory. In the Senate, it\u2019s the reverse where we have the GOP with a six in seven chance of holding on. Democrats are playing a lot of defense in states that they currently hold.\n\nThe terrain there is extremely red. So again, polls aren\u2019t always right. If polls are right, you would have a split outcome.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Polls aren\u2019t right and polls -- polls have a wide margin of error. Rick Klein is going to -- our political director. In part because this race is very hard to model the turnout for a midterm election.\n\nRICK KLEIN, ABC NEWS POLITICAL DIRECTOR: That\u2019s exactly right. And 52-44, eight points is exactly where Democrats need to be -- right on the cusp of where they need to be to be able to say that they have a good shot of taking the majority. If you narrow it down to the battleground districts, you\u2019ve got only a five point edge. So that\u2019s where the majority is either going to be won or lost. And Democrats are depending on groups that don\u2019t typically turn out in midterm elections. Bottom line, George, they need them to vote.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about younger voters, we\u2019re talking about non-white voters. Right now they\u2019re telling pollsters that they\u2019re likely to vote in unprecedented numbers. But that just hasn\u2019t been the history. They need those folks to show up.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Nate, let\u2019s educate voters a little bit on probability because we\u2019re all trying to learn the lessons of 2016, I think. Going into the 2016 election your forecast was actually lower than many others on predicting whether Hillary Clinton would win, about 71 percent. We learned that that wasn\u2019t a sure thing. Here you\u2019re up about 85 percent for the Democrats taking the House, so just explain -- break down statistically what that means.\n\nSILVER: So what our forecast accounts for is the chance that polls will be wrong. And you see how big of a lead a party has and how much uncertainty there is the forecast. The range of outcomes in the House is really wide. Our range, which covers 80 percent of outcomes, goes from -- on the low end -- about 15 Democratic pickups all the way up to the -- to low to mid 50s, 52 or 53. Most of those are above 23, which is how many seats they would need to take the House. But like -- but no one should be surprised if they only win 19 seats.\n\nAnd no one should be surprised if they -- if they win 51 seats. Those are both extremely possible based on how accurate polls are in the real world.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And one of the big X factors you\u2019ve written about this year is -- unusually for midterms -- Democrats actually have a huge fundraising advantage in the final days.\n\nSILVER: They have a fundraising advantage and so one thing we don\u2019t know about is there are lots and lots of districts on -- on the board where there are Republican incumbents in seats that are ordinarily safe and they might not have been aware of the fact that you have a Democrat who\u2019s raise twice as much money, their voters are very enthusiastic, they might be turning out voters who don\u2019t normally vote at midterms. So there are a lot of Republicans who will not be sleeping well tonight and tomorrow night.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why if Democrats beat their polls -- that can happen, it happened in Virginia in the governor\u2019s race last year -- then we\u2019re talking about really big numbers. So both ends of that range, the Republicans holding the House and the D landslide, if you will. I mean, that\u2019s as good as we can do based on how accurate polls are in the real world.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: OK, let\u2019s broaden out the conversation a little bit. One of the other unusual things about this election is the ferocity of President Trump\u2019s campaigning, both in volume and what he\u2019s talking about in the final days. Here\u2019s a little bit of what he\u2019s done in the last three days.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Republicans want strong borders, no drugs, no gangs and we want no caravans, thank you.\n\nDemocrats are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our sovereignty, overrun our borders and destroy our nation.\n\nThere\u2019s some bad people, as I said the other-- they\u2019re bad hombres. There\u2019s some bad hombres in that group.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Chief White House correspondent Jon Karl here with me. The president every single day for the last week has done everything he can to put the focus on the border.\n\nJON KARL, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, ABC NEWS: George, with a president presiding over an economy as good as this one, you would expect there to be almost a morning in America message, stay the course, the economy\u2019s booming, let\u2019s keep with this. But instead it is midnight in America in Trump\u2019s campaign rallies. He is counting on fear and loathing to rally his base. It is a gamble. The gamble here is that they need to get Republicans as energized as clearly the Democrats have been. And largely they\u2019ve done it. You see it in the intensity in our polls.\n\n80 percent of both sides are saying that they\u2019re definitely going to vote. So you see that\u2019s worked. But the gamble here is is he alienating those independent and moderate voters in the suburban districts where the battleground for the House will be -- will be fought. It\u2019s a serious risk. They\u2019ve gotten their base as energized as they\u2019ve ever been. Going to those rallies, I\u2019m telling you, you see Trump supporters as energized as they were in 2016 but they are alienating a lot of moderates.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Even though, Cecilia Vega, that argument many times at odds with the facts.\n\nCECILIA VEGA, SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, ABC NEWS: Completely, in fact we\u2019ve seen not just a campaign in the last two, three weeks based on fear mongering but on misinformation and completely spreading falsehoods.\n\nI\u2019m struck by our poll, the number on immigration, how it ranks in terms of important issues for people. Six out of seven issues, that hasn\u2019t changed despite President Trump\u2019s repeated hammering on this issue.\n\nSo it really has the potential to backfire.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Martha Raddatz, one of the things the president hasn\u2019t been deterred by is sort of a push back from the military. Now 15,000 troops heading to the border, the cost could be up to $200 million by the end of the year.\n\nGeneral Mattis is going along with it, not so much former leaders.\n\nMARTHA RADDATZ, CO-ANCHOR, \u201cTHIS WEEK\u201d: Definitely not some former leaders, including the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey who tries to stay out of politics, couldn\u2019t help himself this week, tweeting \u2018our men and women in uniform are better trained, better equipped and better led so they meet any threat with confidence, but a wasteful deployment of overstretched soldiers and marines would be made much worse if they use force disproportional to the threat they face,\u2019 they won\u2019t.\n\nI think that was kind of a look guys, don\u2019t \u2013 don\u2019t pull your guns out if people are throwing rocks. We heard President Trump talk about that, if there are rock throwers coming at them, they will be seen as firearms.\n\nHe did back off of that and I have to think someone like Secretary Mattis got to him, those troops will not follow any kind of illegal order, disproportionate force, plus they\u2019re back there with concertina wire.\n\nAnd that just \u2013 just as Jon and Cecilia are saying, and you were saying as well, it\u2019s those images. He is appealing to that base. He\u2019s got soldiers down there, the military and helmets and \u2013 and body armor and concertina wire, those are the images that his base will see and he thinks the migrants as well.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Let\u2019s bring in Chris Christie, Republican, former governor of New Jersey, Trump ally as well. Address the \u2013 the argument that Jon Karl was making there. Is it wise to be focusing on this when you\u2019ve got an economy going gangbusters?\n\nCHRIS CHRISTIE, FORMER GOVERNOR, NEW JERSEY: Well I think two things, I think one there \u2013 you see that there\u2019s some real division on the who gets credit for the economy amongst some voters.\n\nBut secondly, George, I think they\u2019ve made a strategic decision, which is the House is much more difficult for them than the Senate. They have a bunch of red state Democrats who they want to try to get out of the Senate.\n\nAnd I think what you\u2019re seeing with the president is he\u2019s made a strategic decision that his ability to claim victory on election night will be by adding seats in the United States Senate.\n\nAnd he doesn\u2019t want to take the risk of looking like he\u2019s doing \u2013 trying too hard in the House, because then he may get blamed for losing there.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You started out saying they, but this is really being driven by him, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, George, as I\u2019ve said to you many times over the last nine, 10 months, he is his own strategist and he does not listen to other people generally in terms of political strategy.\n\nAnd you see this from getting involved in Republican primaries early on this year, which you very, very rarely would see presidents do. He\u2019s gotten involved in many of them, and a lot of the candidates that we have on the ballot today are because of the president\u2019s direct intervention.\n\nSo he is his own strategist, so when I say they I\u2019m using the royal \u2013\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: The royal they. Donna Brazile, one of the things we\u2019re seeing, picking up on what Chris was saying about the Senate strategy, are Democrat Senate candidate \u2013 candidates like Claire McCaskill kind of aligning themselves with the president on this immigration issue.\n\nDONNA BRAZILE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND FORMER CHAIR, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE: There\u2019s no question that she is facing an uphill battle is Missouri, a state that Donald Trump claimed.\n\nBut you know, George, if Democrats win on Tuesday, it\u2019s because they are campaigning on hope, they are focusing on the \u2013 on healthcare, and they are also trying to overcome the odds in these midterm elections by trying to fuel independents and millennials to come to \u2013 come to the polls.\n\nWe see an increase in what we call infrequent voters who are now more engaged, they are more positive about voting, that\u2019s a plus sign for Democrats.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But are \u2013 you know, that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s the hope with the early vote for Democrats, Matthew Dowd, but one of the things we saw back in 2016 is that those voters didn\u2019t come out, particularly Latino voters didn\u2019t vote in \u2013 in higher numbers despite the president\u2019s rhetoric on immigration.\n\nMATTHEW DOWD, POLITICAL ANALYST, ABC NEWS: Well I think this election, like the Trump \u2013 like the \u2013 President Trump\u2019s presidency has a whole unique batch of characteristics in \u2013 as we go into mid \u2013 the midterm.\n\nOur poll \u2013 just to touch again on our poll, our poll actually looks a lot like 2006. In \u2013 in 2006, the ABC poll said Democrats had a six point advantage, they won by eight points. George Bush\u2019s job approval rating was almost exactly where Donald Trump\u2019s is today.\n\nBut there\u2019s unique circumstances, we\u2019ve never had a president go into an election with an economy like this with a job approval in the low 40s. We\u2019ve never had that before, and we\u2019ve never had an election where both sides have been motivated.\n\nAlmost always one side is more motivated than the other side.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I want to \u2013 I want to pick up that, I\u2019m bringing this to Jon Karl as well, because I remember 1994 very well. President Clinton did not go out and campaign a lot in the final days.\n\nThe Democratic base was depressed. This is what\u2019s different about this election this time around, in an off year election, Republicans are engaged. They\u2019re not looking like they\u2019re going to stay home.\n\nKARL: No, and if you go back -- if you go back pre-Kavanaugh, there was real concern among Republicans that they were just not as energized. And the idea, driven by the president but also by some of his political advisors, is you had to find a way to get the base that turned out in 2016 riled up and fired up to vote this time. So the president\u2019s thrown himself right into this, I mean, he is out there non-stop.\n\nBut George, to the point about the House, he\u2019s not even touching any of the areas with -- with -- with the comparative House districts \u2026\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Because they don\u2019t want him there.\n\nKARL: \u2026 No. They -- they don\u2019t want him there. He\u2019s not going there. He\u2019s campaigning solely in the final stretch in states that he won, campaigning in the areas of those states where he is popular.\n\nCHRISTIE: George, let me just say this; I think if we\u2019re looking forward to Tuesday night, two places to look, that\u2019s what kind of night it\u2019s going to be, is the Florida Senate race and the Wisconsin governor\u2019s race. In the Florida Senate race you have the two-term governor against a long-term incumbent Bill Nelson against Rick Scott. And in Wisconsin you have a very close governor\u2019s race, Scott Walker looking for a third term -- the fourth time he\u2019s run in eight years. It\u2019s going to tell us a lot about voters, how they feel about politicians.\n\nAnd in those states that were so key to the presidential election, we\u2019re going to see what happens there in terms of that Republican intensity you\u2019re talking about. If Scott and Walker win then I think it\u2019s going to be a decent night for Republicans.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Those are too different.\n\nBut Matthew Dowd, you make a -- you -- you\u2019ve been talking about the fact that we haven\u2019t been paying enough attention to the governors\u2019 races now, huge potential that there are many flips to Democrats on -- on -- on the governors\u2019 races and that could have a much higher long-term impact.\n\nMATTHEW DOWD, ABC NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah. I -- I mean, obviously, we\u2019re all -- everyone in America\u2019s concerned about who\u2019s going to hold the House, who\u2019s going to hold the Senate. But really fundamentally, when you look at politics going forward as we have in the last 20 or 30 years, it\u2019s the governors\u2019 races and it\u2019s the governors\u2019 races in purple states.\n\nTo me, it\u2019s the governor -- it\u2019s where Republicans have held the office, Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Ohio, there is a real high chance they lose in all of those places. And when they lose in those places, it not only affects what happens today, it not only affects what may happen in -- in the 2020 presidential -- it affects redistricting which then they then draw the districts, which then goes forward. So to me is -- yes, we have two big things to watch, the House and the Senate -- but for me, what\u2019s going to really impact what\u2019s going to really impact what\u2019s going forward is those governors\u2019 races in purple states.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And -- and not only in purple states, Donna Brazile, but would everybody look at the possibility of having the first African American governors of Florida and Georgia?\n\nDONNA BRAZILE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND FORMER CHAIR, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE: George, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s going to be a historic night. In addition to Andrew Gillum, Stacey Abrams of course, Ben Jealous in -- in the great State of Maryland, the African American lieutenant governor candidates in several states including Wisconsin as well as Illinois, 42 percent of all of the Democratic nominees this fall gubernatorial, Senatorial as well as House candidates are women, so a Democratic wave depend on women coming out to vote, minorities and other infrequent voters.\n\nCHRISTIE: And George, I was RGA chairman four years at the midterm the map has been \u2026\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You said Republican Governors Association.\n\nCHRISTIE: ... Yes, Republican Governors Association -- as bad as the map is for Democrats on the Senate side, it\u2019s that bad for Republicans on the governors side, of the 36 governors races, 26 are Republican defenses.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And -- and -- and you, of course, you were a governor. Explain what that means in a presidential year to have a governor from your state in charge.\n\nCHRISTIE: It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- you control the political apparatus in your state. You control who\u2019s counting the votes, most of the time who is the secretary of state or the chief election officer. And going forward from there, you control redistricting after the census or at least have a very large influence over it.\n\nSo as Matthew very aptly put, it\u2019s not only what happens tomorrow, it\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen in 2021 and 2022 on redistricting these House seats, which will have a huge difference. That\u2019s been the Republicans\u2019 huge advantage, \u201909 and \u201910, set the stage for a Republican decade.\n\nDOWD: And -- and keep in mind that the president is the president today because he won three states in those purple states in the Midwest by less than 100,000 votes. And the likelihood that each of those has a -- ether a small blue wave or a large blue wave is very high. Pennsylvania Republicans have no chance, Michigan it looks like the Democrat\u2019s going to win the governor\u2019s race and Wisconsin is a race that\u2019s very tight but the -- it leans in the Democratic favor, that\u2019s where the president won the presidency.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Martha Raddatz -- Matt Dowd just talked about Pennsylvania. You spent a lot of time with voters there in the State of Pennsylvania. That is one of the places where Democrats are hoping to pick up a -- a raft of House seats.\n\nRADDATZ: Exactly. And when -- when you talk to voters in Pennsylvania, especially in those suburbs and some of those who voted for Donald Trump, he has just gone too far for many of them. There -- there is -- they\u2019re -- he\u2019s too divisive for them. For them, Donald Trump is absolutely the issue.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: He\u2019s the issue. And we\u2019re likely to see changes also very changing faces, Cecilia Vega, in Congress no matter what happens on Tuesday night, record number of women running for the House.\n\nCECILIA VEGA, ABC NEWS SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Record number of women, record number of LGBT candidates -- LGBTQ candidates, Donna just mentioned the record number of African Americans running. But I -- I do want to say, the -- we can focus on the president\u2019s travel in the last few weeks and that tells us a lot about where he\u2019s looking, just to go back to Matthew\u2019s comments on Florida. He\u2019s headed to Florida twice in the last week. He is very concerned about having to win that state, not just for now, but for 2020 also.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Everybody stand by, we\u2019re going to be back. But coming up next, party leaders are going to make their closing arguments. RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel and the chair of the Democrat Senate Campaign, Senator Chris Van Hollen.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: They will try to erase our gains and eradicate our progress, that's what's going to happen. They're going to work hard and we will be fighting. It will be -- it will be ridiculous, frankly, it will be bad for our country. The Democrats. And it could happen. It could happen. We're doing very well and we're doing really well in the senate. But it could happen.\n\nAnd you know what you do? My whole life. You know what I say, don't worry about it. I'll just figure it out. Does that make sense? I'll just figure it out.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: President Trump in West Virginia this week.\n\nJoined now by the chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel. Ronna, thank you for joining us this morning.\n\nUnusually, a subdued president there, almost resigned, it seems, to losing the House. Are you?\n\nRONNA MCDANIEL, CHAIR, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE: Absolutely not, especially with the economic numbers that we saw on Friday with 250,000 jobs added to the economy, with wages over 3 percent for the first time in a decade. I mean, the American voters are looking at what's happened over the past two years. They're making more money. More jobs are coming back. That is a great closing argument in a lot of these Houses races that are within the margin of error.\n\nAnd they're going to say Republicans have offered a record of results and Democrats are offering resistance and going back. I think it\u2019s pretty clear.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You say -- you say it's a great closing argument. How come the president is not making it?\n\nMCDANIEL: He is. He's talking about many different things that he's accomplished as president, because the list is so long. I think he's highlighting the fact that we need immigration reform. Democrats aren't coming to the table on that, strengthening our military, taking care of our veterans, taking on the opioid crisis. The national security issues that he's taken on, North Korea, Iran, Syria, all the things that he's accomplished in these first two years.\n\nBut the economy is a driving force with the tax cuts and the deregulation. People's lives are better. They're taking home more money to spend on their families and that is a very compelling argument for many of these voters across the country who are looking at who they want to keep in the majority, and Republicans are the party that's delivered.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So you want -- you want voters focused on the economy on Tuesday. The president every single day over the last week has talked about immigration, talking about sending troops, talking about the migrant caravan, talking about birthright citizenship, even tweeting out that ad -- we're not going to play the whole ad, but we're going to show that ad the president put out about illegal immigration, showing that illegal immigrant who committed murder, blaming that on Democrats. That has caused even some Republicans to react.\n\nJohn Kasich, Republican Governor of Ohio, tweeted out, \"the politics of fear, hatred and division should have no place in our country or the Republican Party, let alone the presidency. All Americans should reject this ad and its motives.\" Do you?\n\nMCDANIEL: Well, I think the president is highlighting a failure in our immigration system, that this disgusting person got into our country twice under a Democrat and a Republican president and was able to kill police.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: He blamed it only on Democrats.\n\nMCDANIEL: We don't want that in our immigration system.\n\nObviously, we recognize that we have a broken immigration policy right now in this country with these caravans coming towards our country, with 12,000 kids that have come unaccompanied, that are coming on their own, because their parents so desperately want to get into this country.\n\nI know why they want to get here, our economy is doing great. We have a lot of jobs. And the president has said, let's get merit-based immigration. Let's focus on eliminating the visa lottery system, something that Canada doesn't do, and let's strengthen our border. And Democrats, again, won't come to the table on an important issue, like immigration. They didn't come to the table on these tax cuts. They didn't come to the table with this president on anything, because they have refused to work with him. And he's closing with the argument of we're the party of results and they're the party of resistance.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: There's division in the Republican Party, of course, on immigration as well. But you're not concerned about the -- the possibility, as we were talking about just earlier in the program, that the president's focused on immigration, the ads like that are going to cause a backlash in the suburban districts you need to hold, in order to hold the House?\n\nMCDANIELS: I'm with the president at these rallies. The president\u2019s talking about all of the accomplishments. I think the media\u2019s focused on immigration constantly, and I get that. But he's focusing on the economy, he's talking about the jobs. He's talking about the lowest unemployment in history for the African-American and Hispanic communities and that our country is on a great comeback and the fact that Nancy Pelosi has said she's going to raise taxes.\n\nAnd the president recognizes the historical trends with the House and the Senate. Usually the party that holds the White House loses three seats in the Senate and 30 seats in the House, and he's doing everything he can to turn out every vote with his exhaustive schedule, but it is a whole variety of issues that he's talking about and accomplishments that he's made as president that have made our country stronger, more prosperous, safer, and has given the American people more jobs, more money and a comeback that frankly a lot of Democrats didn\u2019t think was possible and they certainly didn\u2019t help with.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Chairman McDaniel, you -- you blame the media but it\u2019s the president himself who said he wants the election to be about the caravan.\n\nMCDANIEL: The president has not said he wants it to be just about the caravan. The president\u2019s saying let\u2019s look at the record. Are you better off than you were two years? He\u2019s talking about the economy. It\u2019s just not getting the same coverage. I mean, the economy should be, first and foremost, on a lot of people\u2019s minds as they\u2019re going to the polls. Because remember, President Obama said we\u2019ll never get above 2 percent GDP. And now we\u2019re at 3.5 percent GDP, over 4 percent in some cases.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen 4 million people go off of food stamps. We\u2019ve seen 4 million new jobs come to this country. There\u2019s a lot of good things to talk about. The president\u2019s talking about it. He\u2019s talking about a lot of other things. You know, he can walk and chew gum at the same time.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Where do the House and Senate stand Wednesday morning?\n\nMCDANIEL: It\u2019s tight, George. It\u2019s tight. It\u2019s going to depend on voter turnout on election day. Democrat enthusiasm is definitely there. We are seeing that in the early voting, in all of these key House and Senate races and Republicans have been matching. So literally election day voting is going to determine the balance of the House. I\u2019d say there\u2019s about 27 seats within the margin of error. Obviously we have had headwinds with 44 retirements and historical trends on the House, but I feel like we can still keep that majority and then the Senate is a better map.\n\nAnd if we keep the Senate, that will be defying history as well, because usually you lose three seats in that first term of a first term president.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Ronna McDaniel, thanks very much.\n\nNow we\u2019re going to bring in the chair of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland. Senator Van Hollen, thank you for joining us this morning. You just heard the predictions there from Ronna McDaniel. It is true that your Democratic senators are up against the wall on Tuesday. Are you -- are you confident that you can take the Senate?\n\nSEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D), CHAIR, DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE: Well George, it\u2019s great to be with you. Here\u2019s where we are. We have lots of races within the margin of error, so I\u2019m not going to make any predictions. What I can say is that as you discussed earlier on this program, Senate Democrats really face the toughest political map in 60 years, so it\u2019s remarkable that we\u2019re in as strong a position as we are. And that is a testament to our senators and to our Senate Democratic candidates who are running as candidates who are going to stand up for their states, that their job is to put politics aside, stand up for their states.\n\nSometimes that means working with President Trump if it\u2019s good for their state and sometimes it means opposing the president if it\u2019s bad for their state, like the president\u2019s effort and Republican effort to take away protections for people with preexisting health conditions, a big issue in all these races.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: That is a big issue in all these races. You have seen, as you said, your Democratic Senator Brian Donnelly in Indiana is advertising about how much he\u2019s supporting President Trump. Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota has done the same thing. But seems to be -- especially Heitkamp in North Dakota -- punished for the Kavanaugh nomination, how Democrats handled the Kavanaugh nomination. Any regrets?\n\nVAN HOLLEN: Well first of all, never count Heidi Heitkamp out. In her last election six years ago, she was 10 points down with a week to go. It\u2019s much closer than that in North Dakota. Don\u2019t count her out. The reality is that Heidi Heitkamp did as she always does, what she thought was the best thing for the country. Sometimes that means supporting the president on issues, as she did with the earlier Justice Gorsuch, and sometimes that means opposing the president on these issues.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: How about Bob Menendez in New Jersey? It\u2019s a race we haven\u2019t talked too much about. Of course he was indicted, later acquitted on corruption issues. But he -- he does seem to be in a tighter race in New Jersey than you would expect. Are you confident he\u2019s going to pull it out or are you concerned that he may be holding back Democratic House candidates?\n\nVAN HOLLEN: I\u2019m absolutely confident that Bob Menendez will win that race. The people of New Jersey have been very clear. They do not want a rubber stamp for Donald Trump, and that is what Bob Menendez\u2019s opponent has -- has done and will do. And his opponent has spent $30 million of -- of money that he gained as a CEO of -- of a pharmaceutical company where he really gouged on prices for cancer patients. So that\u2019s why you have a competitive race in New Jersey. Obviously there are other issues Bob Menendez has to litigate, but people in New Jersey do not want a Donald Trump rubber stamp.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Democrats hoping they can pick up seats in Nevada and Arizona. One of the big X factors there is will Latinos turn out to vote. Will they?\n\nVAN HOLLEN: Yes, they will. And we\u2019re already seeing the early voting results in those states, and you are seeing a good, healthy turnout among Latino voters, as well as younger voters. And you\u2019re seeing a pattern of good turnout for Democrats and independents who are supporting Democratic candidates around the country, George. And again, that issue that has been front and center for the last two years, the Republican efforts to take away important healthcare protections is one that Senate Republican candidates have been running away from their records on. And we\u2019re making sure that people know exactly what they -- they did, which was vote either in the Congress, the Senate, or through lawsuits to take away those protections for people with preexisting conditions.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll also say that the Republican Senate leader\u2019s comments the other day about the Republican plan to cut Medicare and Social Security gives away their playbook. The debt went way up to $2 trillion as a result of the tax cut for big corporations. Now they want to come back and take it out on people who have Medicare and Social Security.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Are you prepared for a world Wednesday where Republicans pick up seats in the Senate?\n\nVAN HOLLEN: George, we\u2019re prepared for whatever result we have. But let me just say that the fact that we still have a narrow path to a majority is a sea change from where we were 18 months ago. And as I said, it\u2019s because our candidates have always said they\u2019ll stand up for their states, first and foremost; put aside the politics, do what\u2019s right. And we\u2019re seeing the results here. These are some very close races. And of course, they\u2019re in states that Donald Trump won big. And it\u2019s a testament to these candidates that they\u2019re so focused on what matters to people in their state.\n\nWhen it comes to healthcare, that is not a top-down issue. It\u2019s not like, you know, President Trump going out there and talking about immigration and trying to divide people. And by the way, we\u2019ve just seen a litany of documented false statements and lies from the president on that issue.\n\nBut on the healthcare issue, this is a bottom-up issue. When Republicans tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, you found people in rural areas, in rural hospitals say no. You found the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Association, all these local chapters who have nothing to do with politics, said, \u201cDon\u2019t take away our protections for healthcare.\u201d\n\nAnd yet Republicans continue to try to do that.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Chris Van Hollen, thanks very much.\n\nVAN HOLLEN: Thank you.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: We\u2019ll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDEBORAH ROBERTS, JOURNALIST, ABC NEWS: You talked about all the votes, what about voter suppression? People are saying that minority votes \u2013\n\nBRIAN KEMP (R), GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE, GEORGIA: Well that\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s a myth. That is a myth that \u2013 that the Democrats bring out every two years. We have record number of people on our voting rolls.\n\nROBERTS: So what do you say to people who say that you\u2019re trying to suppress the vote? What do you say?\n\nKEMP: I\u2019m not trying to suppress \u2013 the numbers don\u2019t lie about that fact. Minority participation is up 23 percent in Georgia, 23 percent. That\u2019s what you should report, and not believe the B.S. about voter suppression.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Republican candidate for governor in Georgia Brian Kemp there talking to our Deb Roberts.\n\nI want to bring in our Chief Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas for more on this whole issue of voting rights, voter suppression, and access to the ballot. You just heard Brian Kemp call it a myth there, but we're looking at this issue in several key states.\n\nPIERRE THOMAS, ABC NEWS CHIEF JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Right, Georgia is one of them.\n\nThere are about 50,000 votes that we have been paying attention to where there's some question as regard to voter registration, how it compares to other government records. There are about 50,000 people, 70 percent of those are African-American, so some people are very concerned about that.\n\nNow, those people should be able to vote on Election Day if they show up with their proper ID. But it will depend on how the polling stations deal with those individual voters, George.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You have also got a serious issue in the state of North Dakota.\n\nTHOMAS: Exactly, that\u2019s very interesting. In that state, you have to have a-- show a proof of residency when you vote. So, many of the Native Americans who live on reservations, they haven't had that -- those type of addresses. So, they've been scrambling in recent weeks trying to get specific addresses so they can show, again, it will depend on how each polling station deals with them when they come in to vote.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Connected to this issue, the whole issue of ballot security, so many concerns about the possibility of hacking into the election systems this year. Several Senate candidates have said they have been hacked. What's the state of ballot security looking ahead to Tuesday?\n\nTHOMAS: There's good news and bad news. Here's the good news, we're not seeing the level of Russian activity that we saw in 2016. Certainly nothing on the scale of hacking the DNC or the Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.\n\nBut you still see, according to some sources, the Russians trying to affect the campaign through social media, putting out bad information, trying to sow seeds of division among Americans about issues of race, immigration and things like that.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And the big social media companies, like Facebook, still haven't quite figured out how to deal with it.\n\nTHOMAS: They say they're trying harder. The issue of finding these accounts which are pushing out this information. Facebook, in fact, talked about how they set up a war room. They have got about 20,000 employees that they said are working on this. Twitter said they have identified thousands of people, thousands of accounts in which people were trying to sow disinformation, they have taken down those accounts. We're talking millions of these accounts, so it's an ongoing threat.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And you'll be tracking these issues all through the night Tuesday. Pierre Thomas, thanks very much.\n\nWhat happens the day after election day? Mary Bruce joins us from Capitol Hill and how Democrats plan to take on Trump if they win the House. We'll be right back with that and our roundtable.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Nate Silver, super model right there, for FiveThirtyEight.\n\nI want to talk now about the day after the election. I want to bring in our Chief Congressional Correspondent Mary Bruce for more on this. We don't know what is going to happen Tuesday night, Mary, but Democrats hopeful they'll take control of the House.\n\nTalk about their plans if that happens.\n\nMARY BRUCE, ABC NEWS SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, George, if Democrats do take the House, they are going to put the Trump administration under an intense microscope. They are likely to launch investigations into everything from conflicts of interests to the president's tax returns and of course the issue of Russian collusion.\n\nDemocrats feel that this administration has been able to act unchecked, and that is likely to come to a screeching halt.\n\nBut there is a political risk here for Democrats. They're going to have to show that they can legislate, not just investigate. So, first up, expect them to pass something to address the issue of corruption in government. Democrats are well aware that Americans are fed up with Washington. And they're going to want to send a message that there's a new sheriff here in town.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And if Republicans hold the House?\n\nBRUCE: If Republicans hold the House then, George, you're going to see more of the same. Congress will continue to act in the way that they have.\n\nBut there is no big push, no big rush of legislation at the ready; no immigration bill, no big tax plan standing in the wing here. While Republicans are running on these issues, there is no big legislative push right now, here to back all of that up.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And on the Republican side, if the Republicans hold the House, likely to see a pretty serious fight for leader, to be speaker of the House.\n\nBRUCE: Yeah, absolutely. Paul Ryan, of course, has already said that he is out. You are then going to see a huge fight to replace Paul Ryan, lots of names being floated; Kevin McCarthy, Steve Scalise. And of course some of those on the far-right of the caucus, like Jim Jordan, those from the Freedom Caucus. A lot of names here that are going to be fighting to be Speaker of the House if Republicans do take the House.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And if Democrats take the House, no guarantee that Nancy Pelosi will be the House Speaker.\n\nBRUCE: No, George. Look, whether or not Nancy Pelosi will be Speaker will depend in large part upon the size of any Democratic majority and the makeup of a Democratic caucus. Lots of Democratic candidates have already said that they will not support Pelosi. And you\u2019re going to see, likely, a lot of calls for some new blood in Democratic leadership. That said, Pelosi has a lot of experience, she knows how to pass bills, and she certainly will know how to wrangle a diverse caucus as they launch all of these investigations.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: OK, Mary Bruce, thanks very much. Back here with our analysts, I want to get to what we\u2019re watching on Tuesday night. But first, I want to do a couple questions for Donna and Chris. Donna, first, on that question I just posed to Mary Bruce. What \u2013 what \u2013 how big a margin do the Democrats need for Nancy Pelosi to be guaranteed that she\u2019ll be the Speaker?\n\nBRAZILE: First of all, Nancy Pelosi\u2019s probably one of the best whip counters in the Democratic caucus. So I wouldn\u2019t throw her under the bus right now because she knows how to win, she\u2019s raised over $130 million for Democrats across the country. One of the reasons why we have a diverse lineup of candidates is because Nancy Pelosi went out there and encouraged those candidates to run.\n\nSo I see Nancy Pelosi \u2013 I mean, she\u2019s going to fight like hell. There is a call for new blood, more people in the leadership. And just remember, George, 15 percent to 25 percent of those newly elected Democrats, they will look for someone who can carry the mantle for them in 2020 and beyond.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And Chris, for the White House, a House with subpoena power is a brand-new ball game.\n\nCHRISTIE: Oh, yes.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Is the White House braced for that, are they ready for it, are they prepared?\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, they\u2019re getting a new White House counsel who should be in place in time for January. And if it\u2019s a Democratic House, it\u2019s very well it could be their main job is going to be to be a subpoena processor over at the White House. And I think Mary was right, though, that there is real political risk in that as well. We saw that happen with the Republican House and Bill Clinton in the \u201890s.\n\nYou go too aggressive in that regard, it can be a backlash against those people. So that\u2019s what I think, and by the way, every dollar I have in my pocket, if they win the House, Nancy Pelosi\u2019s going to be Speaker. Sharpest elbows, best counter, she is going to be the Speaker. Everything else is pretend.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: We are all going to be here on Tuesday night, want to get everybody\u2019s take on what they\u2019re going to be watching for. Martha, let me start with you. What\u2019s the big thing you\u2019re going to be watching Tuesday night?\n\nRADDATZ: Well, I think I\u2019m even going beyond Tuesday night. I think one of the things we\u2019ve watched Tuesday night is not whether the Democrats gain control of the House but it\u2019s also how people campaign, and what this has meant about these incendiary ads. That\u2019s a lesson that everybody will learn going forward, not just to 2020, but beyond. Is this the kind of fear-mongering that works? If it does, you\u2019ll see a lot more of it.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Jon Karl?\n\nKARL: I\u2019m going to be watching Pennsylvania. Polls close at 8 o\u2019clock so we\u2019ll see relatively early. Trump won the state by 44,000 votes. It was a key reason that he is president and the Republicans could lose up to eight seats in the state of Pennsylvania. They\u2019re almost certain to lose two because of redistricting. How they do between that margin, I think, will determine largely where we go in the rest of the midterms.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: On the House?\n\nVEGA: I\u2019ve got my eyes on the suburbs all around this country, looking at places like the seventh congressional district in Virginia where you\u2019ve got a female newcomer, Abigail Spanberger running and\u2013 looking to unseat a third-term Republican there. Will there be a so-called \u2018Pink Wave\u2019 with someone like this ushering out a Trump supporter in a \u2013 in a Trump district? We will see.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Matthew Dowd?\n\nDOWD: I\u2019m watching independents. And that\u2019s going to determine who wins this and all of the races across the country. It\u2019s why Donald Trump\u2019s President of the United States. And a specific race that I think people should be aware of is the Beto O\u2019Rourke-Ted Cruz race in Texas. That race is a lot closer than people think and I talked to a number of Republicans over the last 48 hours. They\u2019re very concerned, the first time they\u2019ve been concerned that they could possibly lose a statewide race in Texas in 20 years.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Well, this gives us an opportunity to talk about the early vote. Just saw this come in overnight. Already, more people have voted in the state of Texas \u2013 what, we\u2019re two days out from the vote, than voted in the entire 2014\u2026\n\nDOWD: Entire 2014. And they\u2019re thinking that there\u2019s going to be more than 7 million people vote in this election in Texas, which is almost a presidential year election return. And most of the growth in those \u2013 is new people, young people, and Latinos.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Beto O\u2019Rourke wins in Texas, he\u2019s automatically near the top of the pack for 2020.\n\nDOWD: He\u2019s already a rockstar, he becomes the biggest rockstar in the country.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Donna Brazile?\n\nBRAZILE: Of course, I\u2019m looking at the Oprah effect. I\u2019m watching Georgia, it\u2019s on my mind. As a daughter of the South, I\u2019m very proud of Stacey Abrams, the kind of campaign that she\u2019s run..\n\nShe\u2019s finishing up her campaign on education. I want to see her win, I want to see her win decisively and I\u2019m also watching the other states as well, including Florida.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: There\u2019s another \u2013 there\u2019s another race in Georgia though, if \u2013 if Stacey Abrams does well, first of all we should that if neither she nor Brian Kemp get 50 percent there\u2019s a run off in the state of Georgia.\n\nSecondly, does she have the strength to carry in Lucy McBath, another key Senate race?\n\nBRAZILE: I think so \u2013\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I mean House race.\n\nBRAZILE: Oh, absolutely, look she has done something that I think Democrats should have done a long time ago. That is she\u2019s expanded the electorate, she has campaigned in rural areas like Doug Wilder who won back in 1989.\n\nStacey Abrams understood that in order to win, you had to bring a new energy in the party, and she\u2019s done that.\n\nCHRISTIE: Florida and Wisconsin, as I said before, are going to be key to watch. And who\u2019s had a good night and a bad night from the parties. If you see the Oklahoma governorship go to the Democrats, it\u2019s going to be a very bad night for Republicans.\n\nIf you see the United States Senate seat in New Jersey go to the Republicans, it\u2019s going to be a very bad night for Senate Democrats.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And Nate Silver, you\u2019re going to be adjusting your forecast all through the evening as we get real results coming in. Give us a sense of what you\u2019re going to be keeping an eye on early in the night.\n\nNATE SILVER, EDITOR IN CHIEF, FIVETHIRTYEIGHT: So to me, you have a two part election, you have the north and the south. We expect that Democrats are going to gain a lot of seats here in the Northeast, in Pennsylvania for example we expect they\u2019ll do very well in governorships in the \u2013 in the Midwest.\n\nIf they\u2019re going to have a really good night, where it\u2019ll really put the Senate in play, they\u2019re going to have to win places in the South, they\u2019re going to have to win Tennessee or Texas, at least one of those, probably they\u2019re going to have to hold in Florida.\n\nThey\u2019re going to have to put these suburban Atlanta districts in play in the House. That\u2019s when you get a margin that might win 35 or 40, and where the Senate might actually get interesting, it might be because of a race like Texas.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Rick Klein, you\u2019re going to be behind the scenes on \u2013 on Tuesday night, and we\u2019ve all are trying to learn the lessons of the last couple of elections as we forecast on Tuesday night, as we cover the races on Tuesday.\n\nWe\u2019ve had some bad exit polls, the 2004 election, 2016 as well. Talk about how we\u2019re going to communicate with voters last-- during the night and \u2013 and with our decision desk.\n\nRICK KLEIN, POLITICAL DIRECTOR, ABC NEWS: We don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know, and we\u2019re going to be as transparent as possible about why we\u2019re not comfortable in a particular race.\n\nWe\u2019re going to provide information throughout the night about where vote is still outstanding, where things look, relying on everyone here on this set and beyond to try to convey the true uncertainty of an unprecedented election.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Jon Karl, you\u2019ve said several times we have to be prepared to be surprised on Tuesday.\n\nKARL: Yeah, I will be surprised if I\u2019m not surprised, George. And I could see getting to \u2013 to Nate\u2019s range of events, I could see us being surprised by a much bigger blue wave than \u2013 than we\u2019ve anticipated.\n\nI could \u2013 I would also not be surprised if we see the Republicans do surprisingly well. I mean we just don\u2019t know, it\u2019s so much harder to poll in \u2013 in a midterm election, it\u2019s so much harder to poll in these House races.\n\nWe just don\u2019t know. And intensity is so high, that also adds to the uncertainty.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And it is also why it is going to be so exciting --\n\nKARL: Yes, it\u2019s going to be a great night.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: -- on \u2013 on Tuesday night. We\u2019re looking forward to having all of you here with us on Tuesday night, looking forward to talking to all of you as well. That is all for us today.\n\nThanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us. We\u2019re all going to be back here as I said on Tuesday night, I\u2019ll be anchoring our midterm election special, analysis from our whole political team.\n\nWe are going to have reporters all across the country in the key states all through the night until we have a result.

She\u2019s the best,\u201d Biden said to a crowd of more than 1,000 people Tuesday night.\n\nFinkenauer, 29, is a two-term State Representative running against two-term Republican incumbent Rep. Rod Blum and is hoping that Democratic enthusiasm and the district\u2019s purple past could help her flip Iowa\u2019s 1st Congressional District.\n\nBiden made a campaign swing through the Midwest. He held rallies in Ohio. Wisconsin, along with his visit to Iowa, with scheduled stops in Illinois, Missouri, North Dakota and Michigan before the week was over.\n\nWith Election Day less than a week away, Democrats are hoping to turn vulnerable districts in the House in their direction, including in Iowa\u2019s 1st Congressional District, where Biden appeared on behalf of Finkenauer.\n\n\u2018This is personal\u2019\n\nFinkenauer previously served as coordinator of volunteers for Biden\u2019s 2007 Iowa Caucus campaign. Both talk about their shared background coming from working-class families and both are hoping to convince working-class voters that the Democratic Party can deliver for them.\n\nFinkenauer has campaigned largely on her background, touting an \u2018Iowa tough\u2019 attitude as the daughter of a union pipefitter and welder, and someone who understands what families in the district face from her own upbringing.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images, FILE\n\n\u2018She comes from really good stock. But I tell you what, she\u2019s tough, she\u2019s honorable, she\u2019s serious, and she\u2019s thoroughly authentic,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBiden, now 75, pointed to the fact that Finkenauer--one of the youngest candidates running in 2018 \u2013 is the same age he was when he first won his seat in the Senate.\n\n\u201cI wondered why anyone would vote for me as a 29-year-old kid for the United States Senate to win, and watching Abby, I know why they\u2019re going to vote for her,\u201d Biden said.\n\nAt 29, Finkenauer would be the first congresswoman from Iowa\u2019s 1st Congressional District and would be one of the youngest women elected to Congress, alongside Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York.\n\nAt the rally Tuesday night, Finkenauer recalled the fight in the Iowa State House to preserve bargaining rights for union members \u2013 an effort that failed in February of 2017 \u2013 as her inspiration for taking on a Congressional run.\n\n\u201cI saw the faces of those Iowans and they had tears in their eyes and so did I. And I vowed to myself in that moment this is not how we treat people in my state or in my country, and I was going to do whatever I could to get it back. So, friends, I decided to run for Congress because this is personal,\u201d Finkenauer said.\n\nIt\u2019s mind blowing that you can\u2019t refinance your student loans the way you can a mortgage. More people who are actually paying off student loans should be at the table making the decisions. #ia01 https://t.co/8urqPTFOnd \u2014 Abby Finkenauer (@Abby4Iowa) November 2, 2018\n\nSandy Hughes, who attended the rally, said that vote is part of the reason she\u2019s voting for Finkenauer in 2018.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s listening to the people, and she\u2019s accessible,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cMy husband works for the school system and they voted down his bargaining rights in the state house. We just think she\u2019s listening to the people in her district and will be more supportive of the issues we\u2019re interested in.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that she comes from a family who takes all those issues seriously,\u201d said James Holmes, who lives in the district and plans to vote for Finkenauer. \u201cHer brother [in-law] is a farmer, her dad was a union welder. I mean she\u2019s not just making this stuff up. This is real to her.\u201d\n\nState of the Race\n\nWith less than a week to go in the 2018 midterm elections, Democrats are hopeful that the district could be one that they flip in their favor November 6th.\n\nIowa\u2019s 1st district, comprised of 20 counties in the Northeast corner of the state, has had purple past. Former President Barack Obama won every county in the district in the 2008 presidential election and 17 counties in 2012.\n\nBut that all changed in 2016, with Trump carrying 18 counties -- flipping 15 that had supported Obama in 2012.\n\nThough polling has been limited for the race, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s House Forecast gives Finkenauer a 19 in 20 chances of winning -- a 95% chance.\n\nFinkenauer has also outraised and outspent Blum in the race. According to data from the Federal Election Commission, as of October 17th Finkenauer had raised $3.9 million and spent $3.3 million, while Blum raised $2.5 Million, spending $1.5 Million.\n\nBut Blum has been outspent and out-fundraised before, and the campaign, citing internal and external polls, says they\u2019ve seen a rally in the last weeks before the election that shows the race isn\u2019t over.\n\n\u201cWe are proud that, despite being outspent nearly 6 to 1, Iowa voters are not for sale to the millions of dollars pouring in from Hollywood and San Francisco to run attack ads against Rep. Blum,\u201d said Blum Campaign Spokesperson Alexah Rogue.\n\nAnd some Republicans view Biden\u2019s visit as a sign that the race is not as safe as Democrats would like a week before Election Day, as Iowa Republican Party Spokesperson Jesse Dougherty told ABC News.\n\n\"Joe Biden's visit a week before Election Day isn't a victory lap for Democrats - it's a rescue mission because Fred Hubbell and Abby Finkenauer's message of raising taxes isn\u2019t resonating with Iowans,\u201d Dougherty said. \u201cEven after outspending Republicans in nearly every race, Democrats haven't been able to break away and now they need Joe Biden to step in to save their losing message.\"\n\nFinkenauer\u2019s campaign brushed off the idea, saying the Vice President\u2019s stop to campaign for his friends isn\u2019t a sign of trouble\u2014just the campaign keeping their energy up in the last week of the election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really excited to have him here. Everyone in the room here indicates the excitement about having him here, and it\u2019s a fun event that\u2019s going to reflect the energy on the ground that we\u2019re seeing every day,\u201d said Kate Waters, a spokesperson for the Finkenauer campaign.\n\nBiden in Iowa\u2014Preview of 2020?\n\nBiden\u2019s visit to Iowa also raises questions about his futures plans\u2014and a possible 2020 run.\n\nMargery Tully came to the rally in her \u201cBiden for President\u201d shirt\u2014a souvenir from Biden\u2019s 2008 presidential bid.\n\nTully said that she would like to see a fourth run by Biden for the presidency.\n\nDarron Cummings/AP\n\n\u201cI think if you just boil it down, he\u2019s just a very good man, and everything else springs from that,\u201d Tully said. \u201cHis values are the old-fashioned values that we all believe in\u2014family, hard work, he just embodies all the spirit of the United State, the spirit of America. And he is just amazing. I count it as one of the highlights of my life that I got to meet him and work with him.\u201d\n\nAides to Biden had previously said that Iowa would likely not be on the Vice President\u2019s midterm travel schedule because of the hype a Biden visit to Iowa would draw.\n\nDespite crowds chanting \u2018Run Joe run!\u2019 while on the trail, Biden hasn\u2019t revealed his plans beyond 2020.\n\nBiden has previously said that he will make his decision on a presidential bid by January, but made no direct reference to the possibility in the state that holds the first presidential contest in the country.\n\nThough not a candidate \u2018at this point,\u2019 Biden has cultivated a campaign message centered on fighting for the middle class, which could be crucial to winning back blue-collar Democrats who voted for President Trump in 2016.\n\nBut while some attendees came out to the rally to see the former Vice President, that doesn\u2019t mean he can definitely count on their vote if he does run.\n\nBobbi Janssen and Chloe Howe\u2014who made t-shirts especially for the event referencing Biden\u2019s appearance on the NBC comedy \u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019 both said that while Biden was a \u2018delight,\u2019 they weren\u2019t prepared to commit to supporting Biden in 2020.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re focusing on our midterm elections, and then we\u2019ll go from there,\u201d Howe said.", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "This week, Disney Parks Blog readers were among the first to learn about new celebrity narrators at the highly anticipated Candlelight Processional during the 2018 Epcot International Festival of the Holidays, Nov. 22-Dec. 30.\n\nAs many of you know, the Candlelight Processional is a beloved part of the Walt Disney World holiday season.

Her father, Phil Vetrano, usually went with her, but he had an injury at the time, so that day, she ran alone.\n\nWhen she didn't come home that night, her worried father called police.\n\nWhile searching with the authorities that night, Phil Vetrano made a gruesome discovery, finding his own daughter dead.\n\nkarinavetrano/Instagram\n\nVetrano was severely beaten, lying face-down in 8-foot reeds, with her front tooth knocked out, her pants pulled down and her socks wet, said Robert Boyce, who was the NYPD chief of detectives at the time.\n\nBoyce called the brutal killing one of the most notable cases of his career.\n\n\"My thoughts were ... she was dragged through [a puddle of] water and then dragged off the path into the high reeds,\" said Boyce, who has since retired and become an ABC News contributor.\n\nHer phone was found thrown in the reeds about 15 to 20 feet from her body, Boyce said.\n\nCourtesy of Jackie Hartstein\n\nPolice recovered DNA from one unknown person on her cell phone, the back of her neck and her fingernails, he said.\n\nNo evidence was recovered from the sexual assault, he said.\n\nInvestigators put the DNA into the Combined DNA Index System -- or CODIS, which allows federal, state, and local labs to compare DNA profiles electronically -- but there was no hit.\n\nThe killing made headlines across the country as her grieving family pleaded with the public for help to solve the case.\n\nNYPD\n\n\"She lived more in her short 30 years than most people do in 10 lifetimes,\" Phil Vetrano told ABC News last year of his daughter.\n\n\"She had a bucket list at 26 years old and she actually accomplished and did most of those things on the list,\" he said, citing trips to Europe, a camel ride by the Great Pyramids and a trip to the Grand Canyon.\n\n\"She went everywhere ... nothing stopped her,\" he said. \"She was extraordinary.\"\n\nMatthew McDermott/Polaris\n\nA young man arrested\n\nDespite the recovered DNA, months ticked by without an arrest.\n\nThen in Feb. 2017, after police had received more than 250 leads and taken 600 DNA samples, a suspect was identified, after what authorities say was a lieutenant following up a lead.\n\nLewis, then 20, was taken into custody, one week after he was first approached by police about Karina Vetrano's killing.\n\nWABC\n\nLewis lived with his mother in East New York, Brooklyn, which borders Howard Beach, where Karina Vetrano was killed.\n\nNYPD Lt. John Russo first saw Lewis on the Brooklyn-Queens border three months before Vetrano was killed, police sources told ABC News at the time of the arrest.\n\nRusso thought he seemed suspicious and called it in, but Lewis left before a patrol car could respond, police sources said. The next day, a 911 caller mentioned Lewis by name and said he looked as if he was breaking into a Howard Beach property with a crowbar, police sources said.\n\n\u201c \u201d I never really meant to hurt her, it just happened.\n\nWhile working on the Vetrano case, Russo suggested taking a look at Lewis. Police tracked him down and say he gave a voluntary DNA sample, which matched DNA recovered from where Vetrano was found, police said.\n\nLewis had no prior arrests so his DNA wasn't in CODIS, said Boyce.\n\nLewis, who didn't appear to know Karina Vetrano, allegedly told detectives he \u201cjust lost it\u201d and strangled Vetrano after spotting her on the jogging path, according to a statement that prosecutors read aloud during his arraignment.\n\nVetrano \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Lewis allegedly told police. \u201cI was just mad at the time. I beat her to let my emotions out. I never really meant to hurt her. It just happened.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u201d He pleaded not guilty because he believes and knows that he did not commit this crime.\n\nAccording to Lewis' statement to detectives read by prosecutors at his arraignment, Lewis fought with Vetrano for about five minutes. He allegedly said he hit her repeatedly, knocking her out, prosecutors said.\n\nThe case heads to trial\n\nLewis, now 22, is awaiting trial at New York City's Rikers Island jail.\n\n\"Mr. Lewis is very optimistic,\" Rev. Kevin McCall of the National Action Network, a Lewis family spokesman, told ABC News. \"He pleaded not guilty because he believes and knows that he did not commit this crime.\"\n\nThe Legal Aid Society, which is representing Lewis, said in a statement, \"We have serious doubts about the collection of evidence and tactics employed by the NYPD leading to the arrest of our client. We\u2019re confident that the jury will critically examine the evidence and find that the government will not prove their case.\"\n\nChris Banks, Lewis' family spokesman, told ABC News they believe Lewis' confession was coerced.\n\nLewis' mother, Vita, said her son was religious and non-violent.\n\n\"I love my son,\" she told reporters last year. \"My son is friendly, God-fearing and would not hurt anybody.\"\n\nMcCall added that Lewis was quiet and a \"bright young man.\" He vowed to \"fight till the end\" for him.\n\nMeanwhile, Phil Vetrano, who told ABC News last year that he'd attend court each day, said his family \"will never let this go.\"\n\n\"We are there to stand for my daughter, who cannot stand for herself,\" he said.\n\nWhen she was alive, Phil Vetrano said his daughter lived her life to the fullest.\n\n\"She always enjoyed herself,\" he said. \"It should be an example to others to live your life, live every day as if it's your last day,\" he said. \"Because you don't know what 10 minutes from now is going to bring you.

The stakes of the 2018 midterm elections only grew as a tense nation approached Election Day.\n\n\u201cThis is about more than issues. This is about who we are as Americans,\u201d former Vice President Joe Biden said recently on the campaign trail.\n\nIt\u2019s a sentiment Trump would likely embrace.\n\nThe midterms are a nationwide referendum on Trump and his governance. They will be by far the most consequential marking point in the Trump presidency after a presidential election that rocked the nation.\n\nSusan Walsh/AP\n\nTrump has done what he can to place himself on the ballot -- sometimes literally saying that a vote for a candidate is a vote for him. But a referendum on Trump is likely to mean vastly different things in different parts of a bitterly divided nation.\n\nThe president\u2019s popularity with his base could keep and even strengthen the Republican Party in rural, blue-collar, and predominantly white swaths of the nation.\n\nThe fierce opposition to Trump could buoy Democrats in diverse, suburban and more highly educated areas that have been trending toward their party anyway.\n\nThat would amount to a socioeconomic and regional reordering of the nation\u2019s politics. The divisions exploited by Trump appear likely to only deepen the splits between red and blue portions of the country.\n\nAmong the dizzying array of potential outcomes is the very possible result of a split decision. It could mean a Democratic-controlled House yet Republican gains in the Senate -- with both outcomes largely because of the president.\n\nBrendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nThat would most likely grind lawmaking to a halt in Washington, with subpoenas, investigations, and calls for impeachment replacing bills and laws as the main business of Congress for the next two years.\n\nMeanwhile, at the state level, Democratic governors and state legislatures could begin marching their governance leftward in advance of the 2020 elections.\n\nRaces for Congress and state offices are turning on so many issues that they\u2019re in danger of being defined by none of them.\n\nThis year\u2019s elections have been about health care, immigration, the Supreme Court, guns, treatment of women, voting rights, domestic terrorism, trade, jobs, taxes, foreign threats, climate change, corruption and even the possibility that malicious actors are trying to sway American electoral outcomes.\n\nBut if the midterms are about everything, they\u2019re really about one very big thing: Trump.\n\nTrump has scrambled politics and the norms that have governed it with a chaotic, freewheeling, and hard-right governing style. He has divided where his predecessors have sought to unite, and put himself in the middle of territories where previous presidents have tread lightly.\n\nThe president\u2019s closing message -- warning of threats of an \u201cinvasion\u201d of migrants, mobilizing troops to the border, and musing about changing laws regarding citizenship -- fits with the divisive themes and fact-challenged assertions that have defined his time in office.\n\nYet it almost goes without saying that Trump wouldn\u2019t view even a Republican wipeout as a cause for introspection or a change in direction.\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnd, if he sees -- as seems likely -- Republican bright spots, after a campaign where his party has mostly lined up behind him, he will surely claim credit and use the results to amplify his message.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a close ally of the president who has been campaigning for GOP candidates, said that the range of hot-button themes means any broad takeaways from the midterms will be limited.\n\n\u201cThere are so many different issues out there that are important to different people,\u201d Christie said on ABC\u2019s \u201cPowerhouse Politics\u201d podcast. \u201cI think the country is going to remain in a certain amount of political turmoil until we get to 2020.\u201d\n\nA president\u2019s party almost always suffers losses in midterm elections, Christie noted, and any results that run counter to that trend would be to the \u201cgreat credit of the president and what Republicans have done.\u201d\n\nThe midterms won\u2019t mark the end of any discussions or debates. Voting will bring conclusions to the political season, but few finalities.\n\nIt's safe to brace for an election that gives virtually everyone something to love -- along with much to hate.", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "Early voting numbers indicate a lot of new voters have taken to the polls already, but there\u2019s one cohort of Americans who hold particular power \u2014 and perspective \u2014 this year: 18-year-olds who are of voting age for the first time in 2018.\n\nAcross the country and across the issues, it\u2019s been a historic year for youth activism -- much of it geared toward getting constituents to the polls on Nov. 6.\n\nABC News has been following 18-year-old activists as part of a multi-month long series on teen voters and the events and influences that help shape their political identities.\n\nJim Watson/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nFor Eliot Flores, the importance of getting out to vote is magnified by his own inability to do so.\n\nThough he just turned 18, Flores can\u2019t vote in his home state of Texas because of his status as a DACA recipient. The heightened rhetoric around immigration -- a top issue for voters across the country -- has pushed him to volunteer on campaigns and educate those who can vote.\n\nAcross America, the 18-year-olds have also upped the conversation on other top-ticket issues.\n\nThe most visible movement was born out of Parkland, Florida, where students launched a nationwide campaign against gun violence after enduring one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history.

But in the midst of trying to get his chosen candidate Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke elected, Flores is also on his own campaign of sorts -- one to get into college.\n\n\u201cI feel like they're both races for something important,\u201d Flores said.\n\nFor Flores, his personal campaign to attend college and his campaign efforts on behalf of O\u2019Rourke merge distinctly around the same thing: His status, and the statuses of thousands more, as recipients of DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which President Donald Trump has already attempted to end.\n\n\"In my own life, I have to be constantly in competition with other students when it comes to scholarships, which are barely available to us as undocumented immigrants, or for acceptance into college. And when it comes to the Beto [O'Rourke] race, it's a race of who can get more votes,\" Flores said. Undocumented and DACA students are not eligible for federal financial aid, but in some states, like Texas, they're eligible for state aid.\n\n\u201cI feel like local political campaigns affect us more than presidential ones and since I'm here in Texas, and want to continue studying here in Texas, block walking for Beto is more personal because he supports immigration,\u201d Flores said.\n\nHis ties to the race are a constant reminder that he isn't able to show up to the polls and vote on Tuesday.\n\n\"By not being able to vote, we\u2019re really missing out,\" said Flores, who has lived in Texas for 15 years.\n\n\"We all have the incentive or the will to make a change or fight for our own future, but we\u2019re just not given the materials to do so sometimes,\" Flores said.\n\nStemming from Parkland, young people take on gun violence with political might\n\nInside the Florida state Capitol, before a crowd of her classmates and reporters, she first said, \"We know what we want, we want gun reform.\" Then Tarr, a senior at the time when a gunman opened fire inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February, added, \"This is to every lawmaker out there ... we are coming after you.\"\n\nTarr recited those words, and variations of them, at the March For Our Lives last spring, only a month after the shooting that took the lives of 17 students and teachers. During the summer as she made stops on the \"Road to Change\" and then again as the cohort of spirited teens traveled cross-country in the lead up to the midterm elections.\n\nAndrew Harnik/AP\n\nSpurring marching, organizing and voting throughout 2018, Tarr and the Parkland students spent this election year overcoming the political apathy often attached to young people, and showing the potential force of America's youngest voters.\n\nTarr, now 18, will be voting for the first time this year.\n\nFrom the onset of their movement, she and the young band of change-makers made the point that in order to make a difference on gun violence, the political makeup of this country must shift. History must be made.\n\n\"Soon we will be given the ability to vote, and we will vote them out,\" Tarr affirmed from the Florida state legislature in the immediate days after the shooting.\n\nBetween graduating high school and delaying college for a semester, Tarr and her classmates, like David Hogg, Emma Gonz\u00e1lez, Ryan Deitsch, Jaclyn Corin and Alex Wind, traveled to 80 communities in 24 states in 60 days to register young voters as part of their efforts to get out the vote. Younger generations -- Generation X, Millenials and post-Millenials -- now make up the largest share of the electorate, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nGalvanizing a historically lackluster 18- to 29-year-old voting bloc might lead to unprecedented turnout on Nov. 6, and the Parkland students could have reverberating impacts on the political landscape of Florida, a key swing state, and Congress.\n\nBut this year's midterm elections, as Tarr puts it, are \"just the beginning.\"\n\n\"For us, Tuesday is both a culmination of all of our work these past few months, and just the beginning of our future to come,\" she told ABC News. \"We work nonstop because we have to, and this is finally our time to create change where it matters: in the polls. We\u2019re following through on our words, our promises, and taking a stand in the best way we know how.\n\n\"I think that\u2019s pretty powerful,\" she said.\n\nNew wave of young voters push for gun control in midterm elections\n\nCourtesy Arieyanna Williams\n\nIn wake of school massacres, church shootings, and ongoing gun violence in the inner cities of places like Chicago, young voters are channeling their pain at loved ones lost into efforts to get voters to the polls.\n\nFor Williams, 18, the painful memory of her murdered father's bloody handprints on the wall of her aunt's home, is a constant source of pain and inspiration to help change gun laws and serve as a positive role model.\n\nWhen the Chicago-native isn't helping adolescent students at Mount Hope STEAM Elementary as a teacher's assistant or tackling freshman year at Michigan State University, she's busy urging college students on campus to vote on Nov. 6.\n\nWilliams feels close to her newly adopted home state and plans to stay in Michigan to vote due to her classes.\n\n\"I plan to have Detroit in my mind when I vote,\" Williams told ABC News. \"Detroit is like Chicago and Flint still needs clean water. They need people to take action.\"\n\nWilliams said she wants to vote for a candidate who shares similar views on gun reform and admires Congressman Beto O'Rourke.\n\n\"Beto is one of those figures I look up to. He's the ideal candidate,\" Williams said. \"Beto has done what other candidates should be doing.\"\n\nWilliams has been an advocate for gun control since high school having lost her father and other loved ones to gun violence. To continue the legacy she left behind as a Peace Warrior in Chicago, Williams joined the \"March for Our Lives\" chapter on campus to continue her activism for gun control legislation.\n\nShe walked alongside hundreds of thousands of people for the March for Our Lives movement where she met dozens of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivors turned activists.\n\nDespite her continuous efforts, Williams questions if all of the work she and others have put in will suffice in the long run.\n\n\"I wonder if the work we're actually doing is going to be worth it,\" Williams said.\n\nUndeterred by her personal doubts, Williams will continue her advocacy and desires to initiate an organization on campus for minorities to vocalize the daily issues they face.\n\nBut, the first thing on her agenda is to vote in the upcoming midterms and she knows one thing for certain -- who and what she intends to vote for.\n\n\"I will vote for hope,\" Williams said. \"Hope will be the person I vote for.\"\n\nYoung people urge votes for urgency on climate change\n\nThis is Zero Hour\n\nYouth activists have been working to keep climate change on voters' radar this year, arguing that young people should vote for candidates who want to take on environmental issues more aggressively than the current administration.\n\nAfter rallies around the country in July the group \"This is Zero Hour\", led by some activists who aren't even old enough to vote, has been holding get out the vote events and voter registration drives around the country to educate voters on climate issues.\n\nArtis, one of the founders who is now a freshman at Brown University in Rhode Island, said he voted for the first time in the primary and will be voting again on Tuesday. He said climate change is the number one issue for him and he hopes to convince more of his peers that the environment is connected to other big issues like health care and racial injustice.\n\n\"I think that it's super important to try to educate people on the different intersections between the issues and hopefully if people see climate change as the connecting piece they'll definitely weigh it more as a more important issue,\" he told ABC News.\n\nAnother organizer, Sohayla Eldeeb, isn't even old enough to vote in her home state of Florida but said she's been working to raise awareness of climate change issues among voters, especially since the recent UN climate report was released.\n\nArtis said that even the candidates he supports in Rhode Island could improve their climate policies and he hopes to work with them after the election.\n\nFor example, he plans to contact Gov. Gina Raimondo's office to get involved in her work on plastics pollution if she's re-elected but also to encourage her to speak out against fossil fuels. He said that after the election \"This is Zero Hour\" plans to focus on educating the next generation of voters on climate issues.\n\n\"We're hoping that the people that we are targeting will come to see climate, climate change, climate policy, new energy policy, as something that they're looking at more closely and talking to their elected officials right now,\" Artis said. \"Without that participation, especially young people, asking questions about these things candidates aren't going to change the way that they campaign.\"", "Airbnb says it had its best quarter ever, even as cities across the U.S. have started clamping down on the short-term rental market", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "bad url", "The cast of the smash-hit Broadway musical \"Hamilton\" used their lyrical gifts to urge people to vote on Election Day this Tuesday.\n\n\"Text less.

The Democrats\u2019 lead has closed from 14 percentage points in August and 13 points in October to now 8 points.\n\nSee PDF for full results, charts and tables.\n\nThe GOP has seen some shoring in its base, including non-college white men and rural residents, as well as among independent women. At the same time, vote intention remains high in typically low-turnout Democratic groups, including young voters, nonwhites, liberals, Democrats and those who lean toward the party.\n\nWith Trump pushing to turn out his core support groups, the election stands more than ever as a referendum on his presidency. That\u2019s not ideal for the Republicans: Trump\u2019s 40 percent approval rating is the lowest for a president ahead of his first midterm elections besides Harry Truman\u2019s in 1946. Trump\u2019s average approval from inauguration to his first midterm is the lowest on record.\n\nAP\n\nTrump's approval rating matters because 59 percent of likely voters say it\u2019s highly important to them to vote for a candidate who shares their opinion of Trump -- down from a high of 64 percent in October, but still a solid majority. And Trump\u2019s approval among likely voters is 9 points underwater.\n\nThe Democratic lead in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, in no way makes the election outcome a done deal. One concern for the Democrats is their over-vote in safe districts. In those districts rated solid or likely Democratic by the ABC News Political Unit, Democratic candidates lead by a vast 67-29 percent. In solid or likely Republican districts, it\u2019s a 58-35 percent Republican lead. And in leaning or toss-up districts, it\u2019s close: 49-44 percent for Democratic vs. Republican candidates.\n\nFurther tea leaves come from the 14 percent of registered voters who, as of late last week, said they\u2019d already cast their ballots. They split exactly evenly: 49-49 percent. Notably, 44 percent of them are senior citizens, generally a more pro-Republican group.\n\nTurnout\n\nConventional wisdom holds that to do well the Democrats need at least a 10-point margin among registered voters before a midterm election, because their support drops among those who actually turn out. But anti-Trump motivation may change the equation. Unusually, the Democrats don\u2019t lose ground in the shift from registered voters -- where they are +7 points -- to likely voters, at +8.\n\nVote intention is high across the board: 80 percent of registered voters say they\u2019re certain to vote this year or already have done so, compared with 65 percent at this point in 2014 and 71 percent in 2010. But it\u2019s unusually high, in particular among Democratic groups. Three-quarters of nonwhites say they\u2019re certain to vote, compared with 49 percent at this point in 2014. And 69 percent of registered voters age 18-39 say they\u2019ll certainly vote, up from 44 percent in the last midterms.\n\nSimilarly, intention to vote is up by 24 points among liberals and 18 points among moderates compared with 2014, vs. 6 points among conservatives. It\u2019s up 9 points among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, compared with a 20-point jump among leaned Democrats.\n\nDemocrats are less advantaged here than it might seem, because registration rates are lower in some of their core groups, particularly young adults and nonwhites. Regardless, having inspired these higher vote intentions, the challenge for Democrats, as always, is to actually turn them out.\n\nGroups\n\nGroup-level vote preferences matter as well as turnout, and here, as noted, the GOP has seen some gains. The party\u2019s candidates led by 27 points among non-college white men last month; it\u2019s 39 points now. Surprisingly, they had only 9- and 10-point leads among rural residents in August and October, while it\u2019s 33 points today. And the party\u2019s improved since last month among white Protestants, evangelical and non-evangelical alike.\n\nThere\u2019s also a change among women; they went from 25- and 22-point Democratic margins in the last two ABC/Post polls to 14 points now, while men continue to divide evenly. The shift chiefly is among rural women. Suburban women, for their part, favor Democrats by 11 points, same as October but down from 21 points in August.\n\nAnother notable change comes among independent women, who now divide about evenly among Democratic and Republican House candidates, 43-41 percent, after a 33-point Democratic preference in October. This reflects more conservatives and whites, and fewer liberals and nonwhites, in the ranks of independent women. It\u2019s produced a tighter contest among independents overall, now dividing 48-41 percent between the Democrats and Republicans.\n\nCountervailing changes on the Democratic side have been slighter, leading to the somewhat closer contest overall.\n\nIssues\n\nAs noted above, health care is key to the Democrats\u2019 prospects; they lead in trust to handle the issue by 50-34 percent, a 16-point margin that\u2019s unchanged from last month. Moreover, health care now leads the list in salience --\u2013 78 percent call it highly important in their vote choice, numerically (albeit not significantly) ahead of the economy, 76 percent.\n\nAt the same time, in the face of Trump\u2019s focus on immigration, trust to handle that issue has moved slightly from a clear Democratic advantage last month, 50-39 percent, to a divided 47-42 percent now. Republicans lead, 49-39 percent, in trust to handle the related issue of border security. Sixty-seven percent call immigration highly important in their vote (it was 70 percent last month), while 59 percent say the same about border security, ranking it sixth in a list of seven issues. It\u2019s the first time ABC/Post has asked about trust to handle border security, but Fox News had +14 and +11 Republican results in June and September, and the Post had Trump +10 over the Democrats on the issue in July \u2013 all indicating no change, despite the president\u2019s recent focus on a so-called caravan of migrants from Central America.\n\nAs reported Friday, the Democrats have a 15-point lead in trust to handle reducing divisions between people and groups (rated highly important to 69 percent of respondents). Their biggest advantage, a vast 32 points, is in trust to handle global warming, though comparatively few, 48 percent, call this highly important in their vote.\n\nThere\u2019s a close division, 45-41 percent between Republicans and Democrats, in trust to handle taxes. It\u2019s typically a concern for the Republicans when the Democrats are competitive on this issue -- and a 9-point GOP advantage exists in trust to handle the economy.\n\nFocusing on health care as the top issue, it\u2019s notable that the Democratic advantage is similar among men and women. It disappears among seniors, who split evenly, widens among college-educated adults, and is +16 points for Democrats in the suburbs. But it flips to +24 points for the Republicans in rural areas. Political independents favor the Democrats in trust to handle health care by a 20-point margin.\n\nThere are differences on the virtually as-important issue of the economy. Women divide in trust on this issue while men favor the GOP by 22 points. Young adults, the Democrats\u2019 best age group, only divide evenly, while seniors go +17 points for the Republicans. So do suburban voters and independents, both by 14 points.\n\nAttitudes on the issues also are useful to view in profile, by vote preferences. Among those who say that health care is highly important in their vote, there\u2019s a 57-37 percent Democratic lead in House vote preferences, and it\u2019s identical among those who prioritize reducing divisions among people and groups. The GOP has a 22-point lead, 59-37 percent, by contrast, among those who call border security highly important in their vote. It\u2019s essentially a dead heat among those who focus on the economy, immigration and taxes. And it\u2019s a whopping +56 points Democratic among those who call global warming highly important in their vote for Congress.\n\nThe economy\n\nThe economy is worth another look, as 65 percent of all adults say it\u2019s in excellent or good shape, compared with just 38 percent heading into the 2016 presidential election and 27 percent before the 2014 midterms. One reason it doesn\u2019t accrue all that much to the Republicans\u2019 benefit is that there\u2019s a lot of partisanship in this view. It\u2019s 86 percent among leaned Republicans vs. 52 percent among leaned Democrats.\n\nAnother factor is that folks are a lot less likely to say they are doing better financially now compared with when Trump took office. Just 25 percent say they\u2019re better off; few are worse off, 13 percent, leaving 60 percent saying they\u2019re in about the same shape.\n\nIt\u2019s reflected in vote preferences. Among \u201cbetter off\u201d voters, 87 percent favor Republican congressional candidates. Among those who are worse off, 86 percent favor Democrats. And the majority who say they\u2019re in the same shape back Democrats as well, by 62-30 percent.\n\nMethodology\n\nThis ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone Oct. 29-Nov. 1, 2018, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,255 adults, including 1,041 registered voters.

This pattern clearly shows soldiers and police approached IMN processions not to restore public order, but to kill.\"\n\nAmnesty International lambasted the Nigerian military's \"horrific use of excessive force\" and said researchers have \"strong evidence\" that security forces wielded automatic firearms during Monday's protest.\n\n\"It seems the Nigerian military are deliberately using tactics designed to kill when dealing with IMN gatherings. Many of these shootings clearly amount to extrajudicial executions,\" Osai Ojigho said. \"This violent crackdown on IMN protesters is unjustified and unacceptable. They were perfectly within their rights to hold a religious procession and protest and there was no evidence they posed an imminent threat to life.\"\n\nThe U.S. Embassy and Consulate in Nigeria issued a statement Thursday expressing concern about the \"deaths resulting from clashes between Nigerian security forces and members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria.\"\n\n\"We urge Government of Nigeria authorities to conduct a thorough investigation of the events and to take appropriate action to hold accountable those responsible for violations of Nigerian law,\" the embassy said. \"We urge restraint on all sides.\"\n\nAfolabi Sotunde/Reuters\n\nOn Friday morning, the Nigerian Army appeared to react to Amnesty International's allegations by tweeting the video of Trump's remarks, along with the caption, \"Please Watch and Make Your Deductions.\"\n\nThe Nigerian Army later deleted the tweet, but not before various news outlets and U.S. officials had seen it.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power tweeted an image of the Nigerian Army's tweet with the video of Trump, and called the tweet \"sickening.\"\n\nTrump later walked back his comments, saying troops \"don't have to fire.\"\n\n\"I didn't say shoot,\" the president told reporters on Friday, when pressed on his remarks the previous day. \"But they do that with us, they're going to be arrested for a long time.\"\n\nNicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n\nNigerian Army spokesman Brigadier General Texas Chukwu did not respond to ABC News' requests Friday for comment on the tweet and why it was taken down.\n\nNigeria's defense spokesman, Agim, told ABC News he believes the army was responding to Amnesty International's criticism by \"using Mr. Trump's video to justify the shooting.\"\n\n\"What did the biblical David use to kill Goliath? I believe you know that he uses stone,\" Agim said. \"I don't think you expect soldiers to fold their hands and watch the protesters run over them.\"\n\nIn response to the Nigerian Army's since-deleted tweet, Osai Ojigho of Amnesty International Nigeria said the West African nation's government \"must hold its security forces accountable\" rather than engage in \"preposterous competition over who does a better job of violating human rights.\"\n\n\"Basic human rights are not subject to whims of the world\u2019s leaders,\" Osai Ojigho said in a statement Saturday.\n\nABC News' Meridith McGraw contributed to this report.", "In a speech that alternated between appeals to national and local audiences, President Donald Trump urged Montanans to vote out incumbent Democratic Sen.

But while most cough and colds are from viruses that might come and go without many complications, others, can be a little scarier. Croup, a cold-like infection that\u2019s common in kids, is one of those.\n\nInterested in Flu Season? Add Flu Season as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Flu Season news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nJim Harbaugh, head coach at the University of Michigan, recently spoke about croup on his podcast, \u201cAttack Each Day.\u201d On it, he talked about taking his two young children to the doctor for respiratory problems that turned out to be croup. His father had recommended a family remedy called mustard plaster \u2014 a paste made of dry mustard, flour and warm water \u2014 to help with cough and congestion. The doctor had never heard of this treatment, Harbaugh said.\n\nTreating croup can be a minefield of trial-and-error for people seeking real help. So here are some tips for treating croup.\n\nBut first, what is croup?\n\nCroup is a viral illness, most often brought on by the parainfluenza virus. It causes swelling and narrowing of the vocal box (larynx) and windpipe (trachea), resulting in cough, noisy breathing and congestion. Children with croup often have a loud, low-pitched barking cough, and make noise when they inhale (called stridor).\n\nThese symptoms normally last only a few days but a lingering cough can remain for up to three weeks. In many kids, it also tends to cause a low fever.\n\nCroup is most common in children ages 3 months to 5 years. In children over 8 years old and adults, however, the airways are large enough where the virus doesn\u2019t cause as much swelling, and croup acts more like the common cold.\n\nCroup is contagious, especially during the first three days of the illness \u2014 or until the fever is gone. Kids can generally go back to school once they feel better and the fever is gone. One tip: Remind your children to cover their mouths with the inside of their elbows when they cough, and to wash their hands regularly.\n\nMost children with croup can be cared for at home, but if it\u2019s severe, they may have difficulty breathing and should see a doctor.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nHow do you treat croup?\n\nCroup is a viral illness, so antibiotics are not recommended for treatment, as they only work on bacterial infections. Your child will get better as the virus runs its course, but in the meantime, here are some easy, safe and doctor-approved home remedies for relieving the cough and stridor associated with croup:\n\n1. Run the shower to steam up the bathroom. Allowing them to breathe in the warm, moist air will help relax the vocal cords and reduce the cough symptoms.\n\n2. Breathe in cold air to relieve stridor. Take your child outside (if it\u2019s cold out) or open the fridge or use a cool mist humidifier, and let them breathe in the soothing, cool air for a few minutes.\n\n3. Use acetaminophen (Tylenol) or Ibuprofen (Motrin) to treat fever. If their fever is over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, these over-the-counter drugs are your best bet. Use as needed, according to the directions.\n\n4. Use a saline wash to reduce stuffiness. If your child has a stuffy nose, you can try using a bulb syringe to get some of the mucus out. A few drops of nasal saline wash (a half-teaspoon of salt with 8 ounces of water) can be used to help loosen up the mucus, after which you can suction it out.\n\n5. Use honey to soothe the sore throat and cough. A teaspoon of honey can help soothe an irritated throat, thin out mucus and loosen the cough. Important note: Only do this if your child is over a year old.\n\n6. Drink fluids. As with all cold-like illnesses, make sure your child is staying hydrated and drinking enough liquids, such as water or Pedialyte. If they can\u2019t drink or keep anything down due to the coughing or difficulty breathing, they should see a doctor as soon as possible.\n\n7. Stay calm and wait it out. The more anxious or upset your child is, the worse the narrowing of the windpipe can get and the harder it can be for them to breathe.\n\nIf you\u2019ve tried all of this and your child continues to breathe noisily or have difficulty breathing, take them to the closest emergency room. Thy may need a dose of an oral steroid or a nebulizer breathing treatment to help bring down swelling. Some children may even need to be admitted to the hospital for closer observation, to make sure the swelling doesn't come back or get worse.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t I use?\n\nSome home remedies are better than others, but you can definitely skip these ones:\n\n1. Cold medicines. OTC medicines like DayQuil or Sudafed are not recommended for children under the age of 6 because they can actually be harmful. These medicines often contain a mixture of different medications that can cause excessive sleepiness or even suppress breathing.\n\n2. Vitamin C. These supplements have not been shown to reduce symptoms or the length of time of the cough.\n\n3. Zinc. These supplements also have not been shown to help with croup.\n\nSo what about Harbaugh\u2019s mustard plaster?\n\nThere\u2019s no available research to support the effectiveness of mustard plaster on treating cough or cold associated with croup. That said, it\u2019s still a widely used home remedy with lots of anecdotal evidence to back it up.\n\nBefore you go playing doctor at home, though, it\u2019s always recommended you check in with your child\u2019s pediatrician first.\n\nDr. Tiffany Yeh is an endocrinology fellow at New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.", "A member of the U.S. armed forces was killed and another was wounded in an apparent insider attack on Saturday in the Afghan capital Kabul, according to Resolute Support, the NATO training mission in the country.\n\nInterested in Afghanistan?

He pointed out the tomb of James Christie, the founder of the famous auction house at one end of the site.\n\nAnd then there's the American legend: Bill Richmond.\n\n\"Bill Richmond was a very famous bare-knuckle boxer from Staten Island, and [he] is buried somewhere here,\" Court said.\n\nThe freed slave left America in 1777, became a cabinet maker and later took up bare-knuckle boxing. He would also socialize with aristocrats and once received an invitation to King George IV's coronation to act as an usher, according to The New York Times.\n\n\"Sure, he had lots of breaks,\" Court said. \"If we can find him, his skeleton will show signs of his very stressful job.\"\n\nRichmond won 17 out of 19 contests and died in 1829.\n\n\"We also have a very famous guy named Captain Flinders,\" Court said. \"He was the first person to circumnavigate Australia which is pretty cool and he actually named Australia.

We'll explain, but first, the basics.\n\nWhen does Daylight Saving Time officially end\n\nNovember 4 at 2 a.m., most of the country will move from Daylight Saving Time (DST) to Standard Time (ST).\n\nDoes this happen everywhere in the country?\n\nNo. If you live in Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa and most of Arizona, your clocks will stay the same. For the rest of you \u2013- enjoy your bonus hour.\n\nWhy do I feel out of whack?\n\nJanet Kennedy, PhD., clinical psychologist and founder of NYC Sleep Doctor, says the best strategy is to switch to the new time right away -- stick to the clock.\n\n\u201cSome people gain an hour of sleep the first night whereas others wake earlier because 6 a.m. feels like 7 a.m. Regardless, stick to your usual schedule and do not go to bed early the following night. Avoid napping and extra caffeine, which can make it harder to fall asleep at the 'right' time,\" Kennedy said. \"It can take up to a week to fully adjust, so don't be alarmed if you feel sluggish in the meantime.\u201d\n\nDaylight Saving Time is just an hour. Can an hour really affect your sleep that much?\n\n\u201cAbsolutely -- we are creatures of habit! Transitions to new schedules take time. Even a change of one hour can make a difference,\u201d said Rebecca Robbins, Ph.D., co-author of \"Sleep for Success,\" and a post-doctoral research fellow at NYU School of Medicine.\n\nHer research identifies strategies for improving sleep and health.\n\n\u201cResist the urge to sleep in on Sunday and instead keep your normal bedtime the night before the time change then wake up -- perhaps without an alarm -- on Sunday and start your day by walking outside,\" Robbins added. \"It will likely be early, but getting up and going about your day will help you adjust to an earlier schedule of sleep and wakefulness.\u201d\n\nShouldn't I use this hour to catch up on much-needed rest?\n\nProbably not. The best example of this is \"sleeping in,\" the weekend temptation we all face without the need to rise early for work or school. It comes with the trap to \"catch up\" on sleep.\n\nBut this is a myth, Robbins says.\n\n\u201cIf we delay our bed or rising time by even one hour our body goes into transition mode, trying to transition to a new time zone,\" Robbins said. \"The best way to recover from insufficient sleep is to keep your sleep schedule as consistent as possible. If you wake up at 6 a.m. during the workweek, you can sleep until perhaps 6:45 a.m. on the weekends but not much longer.\n\n\"Then pay back your 'sleep debt' with a power nap or better yet a siesta, which is a nap that is 90 minutes in duration in the afternoon,\" Robbins continued. \"This will allow you to recover from cutting sleep short during the week without negatively impacting your sleep schedule.\u201d\n\nI have little kids. They\u2019re not gonna sleep an extra hour, are they?\n\nChildren are acutely aware of changes to their sleep schedule. They will likely keep you honest and wake you up at their normal time!\n\nWhat this means for parents is that it will be important to resist the urge to stay up a bit later. Keep your regular bedtime, put the kids to bed at the regular time, and wake up at your regular time.\n\nWinter\u2019s coming. It\u2019s going to be darker when we wake up. How do we deal with that?\n\n\u201cDuring winter months we have evidence that we sleep longer. In some ways, this could be viewed as hibernation of sorts,\" Robbins said. \"Without access to sunlight, our bodies have less ability to fully understand when it should be alert and when it should be tired.\n\nSTOCK/Getty Images\n\n\"To ensure your circadian rhythm remains intact, go outside when the sun is out as often as you are able, and optimally first thing in the morning. This will trigger the alert phase of your circadian rhythm, then an afternoon walk -- even if it seems to be gray outside -- will help your sleep and wake phases stay intact,\u201d Robbins added.\n\nLook on the bright side, Robbins continued.\n\n\u201cColder temperatures can bring about a cozy atmosphere. Develop winter habits with your family that center around lighting candles or a fire and spending time together off of screens,\" she advised. \"This can offer tremendous health benefits that may counteract the drawbacks of less sunlight.\u201d\n\nWhat other sleep advice do you have about this annual event -- setting our clocks back?\n\n\u201cWith the change of seasons ... consider a bedroom refresh,\" Robbins added. \"Is your bedroom cozy and optimized for rest and relaxation? If not consider refreshing your mattress, pillows, or sheets.\"\n\nEric M.

I\u2019m an only child and my father died when I was small, so it's often felt like it's just been my mum and me.\n\nBut her parents did feature pretty strongly in my early life. They lived with us when I was growing up and I knew a little of their history, although as a teenager I was too young and immature to ask the questions I now know I should have. I didn\u2019t expect an encounter on Meghan and Harry\u2019s royal tour around the South Pacific would answer so many of them.\n\nAbout a year ago, I posted the story of how they met to my Facebook page - and it\u2019s a pretty good one. My grandmother, Gabriella Sawaya, was a Lebanese woman living in Cairo in the early 1940s. At the wedding of the King of Egypt, she met a Kiwi officer - Harold Claridge - who was posted to North Africa to fight with the ANZACS (The Australian and New Zealand Army Corp).\n\nCourtesy James Longman\n\nThese were apparently the kinds of parties she was invited to (!) and he was there as a courtesy to his Egyptian hosts to represent his regiment. They met and, so the story goes, they sat on a palace balcony staring at each other. As was typical then, she spoke many languages - Arabic, French, Italian and Greek. Unfortunately he could not understand any of them. So after spending the evening giggling at their misunderstandings, overseen by her elder sister as chaperone, she gave him her address in Cairo.\n\nCourtesy James Longman\n\nHe was sent to Alamein in northern Egypt soon after - where some of the most important battles in the war were raging - and while he was away she learned English for him. He would come back to Cairo on leave from the front and over the next few years they courted. They were married at the end of the war and in 1945 had my mother.\n\nCourtesy James Longman\n\nCourtesy James Longman\n\nAfter being decommissioned, he returned to his work as an architect and brought his family to Libya, Iraq -- where he was involved in building the palace in Baghdad -- and then finally to Lebanon. But with war or revolution in each place, they kept moving, essentially becoming refugees many times over. With his New Zealand passport and war record, my grandfather was eventually able to relocate the family to England in the 1970s, where they lived until they were 96 years old. They died when I was in my mid-teens within a couple of years of one another.\n\nIn 2017, I was in Egypt and visited Helipolis Basilica in Cairo where they were married.\n\nFast forward a year, to a dark patch of earth in an Indonesian hotel courtyard. I was dozing in the heat in Palu, on assignment to cover the earthquake and tsunami, when my phone buzzed. Someone had commented on my Facebook post with a photograph of Harold and Gabriella on their wedding day and the question: James, are these your grandparents?\n\nStruggling to find enough service to reply, I eventually started exchanging emails with this person, initially thinking he was family. But it turned out even better - the man\u2019s name was Mark Cousins and he was writing from Wellington. His grandfather Clarence had been my grandfather\u2019s military orderly - or batman - during the war. He died fighting but during his service had written letters home in which he\u2019d described in glowing terms a \"Mr. Claridge,\" whom he greatly respected. So Mark began to investigate. He took his search to the New Zealand national library and sure enough, found my grandfather\u2019s details. But more than that, he\u2019d found all his personal photo albums.\n\nCourtesy James Longman\n\nA month later I was in Wellington at the end of Meghan and Harry\u2019s royal tour. I had work to do but I HAD to meet Mark and visit the library with him. So we did and what I found was extraordinary. Photos of my grandfather at training camps in New Zealand before the war; on the SS Strathaird that took them via Sri Lanka and Cape Town to the Egyptian front; out in the desert with his men; my grandparents as a young couple; time spent at the beach in Tripoli; at the races in Egypt; in the mountains of Lebanon; my mum as a baby, as a teen and then as a young adult.\n\nMark told me some of the photos had writing on the back but one photo had a particular impact. I randomly chose one of my grandmother looking very glamorous on the beach in Alexandria. I turned it around and sure enough there was writing. In her impeccable script, one short line in pencil: \"Don\u2019t forget me.\"\n\nCourtesy James Longman\n\nI dropped the card and started to cry. She gave this photo as a memento to my grandfather as he went to war. It would have sat in his pocket or in his pitched tent, as they were in the sand dunes of northern Egypt. It would have traveled with him through war and revolution and through time: my mother\u2019s birth and then mine. It was a piece of history and the beginning of their love story and here I was, holding it in my hands nearly 80 years after it was written.\n\nMark and I sat and chatted, surrounded by the story of my family with tears in our eyes. What would they have made of it, we wondered? Our two grandfathers had fought alongside each other thousands of miles away and now here we were, a generation later, back in the home which Clarence at least never saw again. Mark is an extraordinary human being: with a sense of duty you rarely see, he has been piecing together the histories of all the men in my grandfather\u2019s company. And one of them still lives - Dennis. He\u2019s 100 now, back in New Zealand, and Mark tells me he\u2019s going to take the photo of us together, in order to show him this history coming full circle. We still have no idea how the albums made it back to New Zealand or who put them in the library.\n\nIn 1994, Mark did manage briefly to track down my grandfather. He wrote to him to ask for any memories he had of Clarence, and sure enough, he responded. Mark photocopied the letter and I\u2019m now sitting on my flight home with my first chance to read it, again moved to tears.\n\nCourtesy James Longman\n\nHe describes Clarence - or \"Clarry,\" in his typically no nonsense way, as \"an excellent man, well mannered, steady, reliable and quick to learn.\" My mum says the death of perhaps the person closest to him in the war affected my grandfather for the rest of his life. For me, the photos of his time at war have brought into sharp relief the experiences of a whole generation - experiences which are entirely impossible to understand now. The huge personal loss and sacrifice; the danger; the young age of so many of those men.\n\nIn one photo, my grandfather captures a bare-chested soldier crouched in the empty expanse of desert, carefully extracting what looks like a small metal tin from the ground - one of the thousands of German mines his unit was tasked with clearing. A speck behind him in the distance is the next man in the line doing the same thing. So many died doing this. In another, we see lines of troops sitting with their legs dangling over the side of the ship that took them to war, laughing as they catch oranges being thrown up by Sri Lankan farmers on wobbly little wooden rafts. Oblivious, perhaps, to the challenges ahead of them. How many of these men never came back? How many of them did my grandfather have to watch die?\n\nCourtesy James Longman\n\nAt the end of his letter, he tells Mark:\n\n\u201cI did have a hand in the Alamein cemetery construction.

Purdon, a lawyer for the Spirit Lake Tribe, who told ABC News that because the tribe\u2019s emergency motion was denied, he doesn\u2019t know whether thousands of Native Americans who recently obtained new IDs will be able to vote on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the questions our lawsuit sought to answer and unfortunately we weren\u2019t able to get an answer. I can\u2019t say what will happen on Tuesday,\u201d Purdon said.\n\nTribes in North Dakota have been working frantically to provide new IDs in time for Tuesday.\n\nThe new law, allowed to move forward by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this month, now requires voters to provide IDs with a residential street address, which could potentially disenfranchise thousands of Native Americans who live on rural reservations where residential addresses are uncommon.\n\nEstimates from North Dakota\u2019s four largest tribes indicate at least 2,000 voters have been issued new IDs since the high court decision last month \u2014 a pivotal number in a state where the last senate race went to Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp by just under 3,000 votes. But tribal members are concerned that despite the efforts, the new IDs could be denied at the polls.\n\nBlake Nicholson/AP\n\nThat was one reason the Spirit Lake Tribe brought a lawsuit Tuesday against Jaeger, claiming that the implementation of the new law is \u201cunplanned, untested, and broken.\u201d They filed an emergency motion to delay the residential address requirement until after the midterms, but their request was denied when a federal judge determined that a last minute rule-change would \u201ccreate as much confusion as it will alleviate.\u201d\n\nJaeger, however, sought to offer assurances that most voters who show up to the polls with new tribal issued IDs that show a residential address will \"receive a ballot and be able to vote\" either on a regular ballot or a \u201cset-aside,\u201d or provisional ballot.\n\nThose voters would have three days to go to a county auditor\u2019s office and confirm that they have a residential street address, considering weekend and holiday closures.\n\nHe added that those suing the state about the residential address issue should take their concerns to local officials such as their county 911 coordinator.\n\n\u201cI would encourage those people to talk to local officials. They\u2019re asking us to make determinations that we\u2019re not in the position to determine,\u201d Jaeger said.\n\nNevertheless, the systems for assigning and verifying residential addresses, which are at the heart of the lawsuit as potentially faulty, give qualified Native Americans reason for pause, according to tribal lawyers.\n\nDan Koeck/Reuters\n\nSpirit Lake\u2019s lawsuit indicates that a tribal member spoke with a county 911 coordinator, as Jaeger recommended, and got an official residential address.\n\nBut her address was not considered valid in the state\u2019s system.\n\nAnother tribal member was issued a state ID for an address in Oberon, North Dakota, but when a different resident of his same home called 911 coordinators to get an ID, she was given an address a few miles away in Fort Totten, North Dakota.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine how hard it is to live on a reservation, in some of the poorest communities, and then you face these sort of hurdles to exercise your right to vote?\u201d Purdon told ABC News.\n\nDespite the challenges, many in his community have become more motivated to cast their ballots.\n\n\u201cMy friends who live on the reservations say they are undaunted,\" he said.", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "It's Halloween night in Alton, New Hampshire, a quaint town on the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee of just over 5,000 people located smack dab in the middle of one of America's quintessential swing congressional districts, and Republican candidate Eddie Edwards is handing out candy to a young girl proudly displaying her light-up princess dress.\n\n\"Happy Halloween, don't forget to vote!\" Edwards says with a nod to the young girl's parents. A child dressed as a \"Pac-Man\" machine, a tall man sporting scarily realistic costume of \"Halloween\" villain Michael Myers, and a young boy donning a policeman's cap all drop by as the candidate diligently drops handfuls of candy into their waiting arms.\n\nIt's New Hampshire, less than a week from a pivotal midterm election, and Edwards, an African-American Navy veteran and former police officer, and his Democratic opponent Chris Pappas, an openly gay member of the New Hampshire Executive Council, are both vying for every last vote in a race that puts the state's political independence and idiosyncrasies on full display.\n\nNo matter who emerges victorious in the race this Tuesday, history will be made by either Edwards or Pappas, who would be the state's first African-American or openly gay Member of Congress respectively.\n\n.@EddieEdwardsNH, a former police officer, handing out Halloween candy to a future cop \u201cWelcome to the force\u201d he says pic.twitter.com/3t8CYDqUEZ \u2014 Johnny Verhovek (@JTHVerhovek) October 31, 2018\n\nAs the crowd of trick or treaters passing by the candidate started to thin, a woman approaches Edwards and leans in close to whisper that she is supporting him, despite the fact that her family members are all Democrats. Edwards gives her a thumbs up and a hearty thank you.\n\nNew Hampshire's 1st Congressional District, which includes the cities like Manchester and Portsmouth and more rural areas alongside the state's border with Maine, has switched back and forth between Democratic and Republican control for each of the past five election cycles, and the retirement of incumbent Democratic Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter immediately put the seat back on the list of battleground races that will play into control of the U.S. House on Tuesday.\n\n\"We\u2019re going to stop that,\" Edwards, who has been joined on the campaign trail by the likes of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, told ABC News of the district's inconsistency in party representation.\n\nHe chalked that flux up to voters' desire to have responsive representation in Washington.\n\nElise Amendola/AP\n\n\"That\u2019s New Hampshire. They\u2019re all about Live Free or Die. We want to make sure we have representation that reflects our values and who we are in this state,\" Edwards told ABC News in an interview at a makeshift campaign office in Alton inside a house owned by a local state representative and fire chief, \"You've got to bring it every election, you\u2019ve got to deliver it when you\u2019re there. And if you\u2019re not, and you don\u2019t deliver, voters will let you know.\"\n\nThe potential historic nature of the race is not lost on Edwards.\n\n\"That\u2019s what America is all about right? New Hampshire proves every single stereotype and statistic about our country wrong every single time,\" Edwards said, \"You\u2019re in a state that is 93 percent white, and they\u2019re electing potentially their first African-American running against an openly gay person in our state \u2013 that\u2019s what New Hampshire is all about. In New Hampshire, it doesn\u2019t matter your race, your ethnicity, the gender...what you give to your family to your community and your country is what makes you special.\"\n\nThe district voted for George W. Bush twice, Barack Obama twice, and narrowly sided with Donald Trump in 2016, but Edwards says support for the President is understated by widespread in the district.\n\n\"People are happy, and people are quiet too. There\u2019s a lot of support for the President in this district. The problem is that Republicans are afraid to be attacked right now,\" Edwards said, \"I met one of our seniors in our state, she whispered to me, she said I\u2019m going to vote for you, I really support our president, I really support Republicans, but I can\u2019t say it too loudly because I get bullied. So I think it\u2019s underplayed just how much support the President has in this district.\"\n\nBut following a week defined by political violence and a President who shows little desire to ratchet down the tension, the depressing effect Trump could have on candidates like Edwards still looms, despite the candidates dismissals.\n\n\"We\u2019re a nation of 330 million people, the tension in this country happened long before the President was elected, and we don\u2019t want to be honest about it,\" Edwards said, \"I know people want to point the finger at the President and say well he\u2019s at the top, that\u2019s where we get our leadership from. I\u2019m running for Congress, I\u2019m part of the leadership for this country. There are 535 people who are in Congress, they have an equal responsibility, not a subservient role, as the president to bring us together.\"\n\nA Democrat asserting independence\n\nDespite Edwards' confident defense of the president and his own self-assurance, he is undoubtedly facing a formidable opponent in Pappas, a Harvard-educated small business owner who was first elected as a state representative in 2002 when he was 22.\n\nNow 38, Pappas has run an aggressive campaign to keep the seat in Democratic hands. ABC News partner FiveThirtyEight currently gives the Democrat a 5 in 6 chance to win the seat on Tuesday.\n\nEarlier that Halloween day, the candidate toured a rubber manufacturing plant in the town of Rochester to highlight the importance of job training and technical skills, telling ABC News \"I run every campaign like I\u2019m five votes behind, and we\u2019re just sprinting through the finish.\"\n\nWhen asked about the district's political indecision, Pappas said it's in New Hampshire's nature to look at candidates not solely through the prism of partisanship.\n\n\"Most voters are Independents. They pick and choose based on the issues and the individuals and not based on party affiliation,\" Pappas said, \"We\u2019ve got an important case to make to the broad section of voters that are in the middle, who are Independents and who tend to focus late on political decisions like this.\"\n\nCJ Gunther/EPA via Shutterstock\n\nThose independent voters include people like Kenny Couch, a 45-year-old veteran and production supervisor at the same manufacturing facility Pappas toured who told ABC News he is still undecided about who is voting for on Tuesday and lamented the current state of political discourse in the country.\n\n\"I could care less about what Trump is doing,\" Couch said amid the whir of machinery around him, \"Yeah there\u2019s a lot of things I\u2019d like for him not to do, but I don\u2019t care about that. This is the issue I want to know about \u2013 why are our children going hungry? Why don\u2019t we have these programs for our kids, statistics and where do we rank in the world in education \u2013 not even in the top 25. And we\u2019re the greatest country in the planet.\"\n\n\"For me personally the best candidate will at least attempt to do what he says he\u2019s going to do and represent the constituents that voted him in and see where the chips lay,\" Couch added, glancing towards Pappas and offering a somewhat positive review, \"I feel that he\u2019s young, ambitious. I think that bringing industry to New Hampshire is awesome, bringing in the right people and things like that, so if he can do that and run on that, absolutely I think that he would be supported very well.\"\n\nPappas has continued to hammer home an economy-centric message in the campaign's final days, telling ABC News \"I think we\u2019ve got to make sure that we have policies that can respond and ensure that we reward hard work and allow people to reach the middle class and stay there.\"\n\nOn the question of whether or not he will support Nancy Pelosi as the next Speaker of the House if Democrats re-take the chamber on Tuesday, Pappas says he's taking a wait and see approach.\n\n\"There\u2019s going to be a leadership fight, we\u2019ll see who runs and what the contours of that would look like,\" Pappas said.\n\nThe Democrat said he can see himself working with the Trump administration on issues like infrastructure, but said there's no doubt that President Trump has contributed to the political strife not just in recent days, but throughout his time in the Oval Office.\n\n\"The tone matters and our leaders help set that tone. And we\u2019ve seen a very divisive couple years in this country in part because of the statements and policies of this President,\" Pappas said, \"I think it\u2019s important that we have checks and balances in Washington, that we look for ways to bring people together and create a conversation about the priorities of the voters and not get into the sort of name-calling and baseless attacks that people are just sick and tired of.\"", "For years, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher has cut a unique figure in Washington\u2019s foreign policy world \u2013 a staunch Reaganite who has taken an unexpected ideological turn in advocating closer ties with Russia, even boasting about a drunken arm-wrestling contest with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the early 1990s.\n\nNow, the Orange County Republican once dubbed \u201cPutin\u2019s favorite congressman\u201d by Politico is one of the scores of House Republicans scrambling to defend his seat in the midterm elections against a Democrat \u2013 Harley Rouda, a former Republican attorney and businessman \u2013 in a district Hillary Clinton carried by 1.7 points in 2016.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how those attacks and Rohrabacher\u2019s record will ultimately factor into the election results.\n\nRohrabacher and fellow Republican, Devin Nunes, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, have weathered attacks from Democrats and Republican primary opponents focused on Russia and the investigations into 2016 election interference.\n\nKyle Kondik, an analyst at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics and managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, said almost any issue in the campaign could prove \u201cdecisive\u201d if the race is decided by a few percentage points.\n\n\u201cThat said, a lot of experts on both sides of the House fight seem to believe Rohrabacher is still holding up OK,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cPart of the reason is that his district is probably a little more Republican than similar districts in Southern California with imperiled GOP incumbents.\u201d\n\nRohrabacher\u2019s campaign did not make him available for an interview, but in a recent appearance on Showtime\u2019s \u201cThe Circus,\u201d the congressman said he believes he\u2019s in a close race because of how long he\u2019s been in office.\n\nBill Clark/Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tighter race, obviously, when someone says \u201830 years is enough.\u2019 That\u2019s a good slogan but 30 years also means that you have seniority, you know what to do, you know how to get things done to better Orange County.\u201d\n\nFight for his political life\n\nLocal and national political analysts watching the race say Rohrabacher could still retain his seat on the strength of his conservative and libertarian-leaning record, even as other vulnerable House Republicans come up short on election night.\n\n\u201cHe's been around for almost 30 years in Congress,\u201d Zev Yaroslavsky, a former Los Angeles County supervisor and director of the Los Angeles Initiative at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs, who has known Rohrabacher for decades, told ABC News. \u201cDon't underestimate him because he will fight.\u201d\n\nAfter winning re-election two years ago by double digits, Rohrabacher emerged as one of two victors in a jungle primary last June, barely topping 30 percent of the vote in a race with more than a dozen candidates.\n\nOnce a speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan, he was an ardent Cold Warrior when he was elected to Congress in 1988. But Rohrabacher\u2019s position evolved as the Cold War wound down. He became increasingly convinced that the United States and Russia could work together to take on shared challenges, such as terrorism in the Middle East \u2013 a view shared by President Donald Trump.\n\nRohrabacher has used his position as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee with jurisdiction over Russia policy to advocate for closer relations and push back against economic sanctions.\n\n\"Everything I do is aimed at what's good for the United States,\" he told ABC News in an interview last year, rejecting being labeled as pro-Russia.\n\nTo Russia, his voice in Congress is seen as so important that FBI agents once warned him that he was considered a target for recruitment by intelligence operatives, according to The New York Times. The senior committee post has also put him in contact with many of the key figures that have emerged in the congressional and federal investigations in Russian election meddling.\n\nA spokesman for Rohrabacher dismissed the encounters, saying it is \u201cliterally his job to meet with Russians and other foreign officials\u201d and that the congressman \u201chas met with far more anti-Russian Ukrainians that he has Russians.\u201d\n\nRohrabacher and the Russia investigation\n\nIn April of 2016, he met in Moscow with Natalia Veselnitskaya \u2013 the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign officials in Trump Tower that June for a meeting advertised as an opportunity to discuss potential dirt on Hillary Clinton.\n\nVeselnitskaya told a Crimean news service the meeting was about sanctions, and Rohrabacher\u2019s office told Foreign Policy that she was one of many people he met on a congressional trip to Russia.\n\nThat summer, he met with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, months before the site released hacked Democratic emails received from Russian hackers.\n\nTrump campaign aide Rick Gates pleaded guilty earlier this year to lying to federal agents about the topics of conversation in a 2013 meeting with a lobbyist and a congressman - later confirmed by ABC News to be Rohrabacher.\n\nKent Nishimura/LA Times via Getty Images\n\nAs ABC News has previously reported, the congressman also met several times with Maria Butina, who was later charged with acting as a Russian agent by the U.S. government. His office has dismissed those encounters as routine, given his subcommittee chairmanship.\n\nRohrabacher was one of two sitting lawmakers -- along with former Democratic National Committee Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- to have been interviewed by the House and Senate Intelligence Committees as part of the panels\u2019 Russia investigations.\n\nThe committee left Rohrabacher\u2019s transcript, along with Wasserman Schultz\u2019s and a handful of others, off the list of more than 50 they plan to declassify and release. Democrats have said they would release the transcript if they take the House, and with it, control of the committee.\n\nRohrabacher told CNN he was an \u201copen book\u201d with investigators and was questioned about trips to Russia and meetings he had there.\n\nThe California Republican\u2019s advocacy for Russia has put other Republicans in an uncomfortable position \u2013 most notably when the Washington Post obtained a recording of House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy privately joking with other top Republicans in 2016 that Putin \u201cpays\u201d Rohrabacher and Trump. (McCarthy later told reporters the comment was a bad joke.)\n\nLast year, Republican leaders started scrutinizing his official travel privileges as the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats.\n\nSubsequently, Rohrabacher paid his way own way to Europe and a meeting with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in August of 2017.\n\nRohrabacher tried to deliver a message from Assange to Trump \u2013 an effort to broker a deal for Assange to turn over what he described as evidence that Russia didn\u2019t hack the Democratic National Committee and pass materials to Wikileaks that the site later published \u2013 but said he was blocked from doing so by White House chief of staff John Kelly, he told ABC News at the time.\n\nDems take aim at Rohrabacher\n\nAll the overlap with the Russia investigation has provided plenty of grist for Rohrabacher\u2019s political opponents.\n\nScott Baugh, a former member of California State Assembly who was considered Rohrabacher's main GOP challenger, swiped at Rohrabacher's focus on Russia ahead of the primary.\n\n\"I think his preoccupation with Russia and marijuana [law reform] to the exclusion of issues the district cares about is a strong indication it's time to retire,\" he told Capitol Weekly, a nonprofit news outlet.\n\nRouda, Rohrabacher's general election opponent, released an ad earlier this year urging voters to \u201cshow Trump and Rohrabacher it\u2019s time for a leader who represents us, not Russia.\u201d The candidates also sparred over Rohrabacher\u2019s relationship with Russia in a recent debate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of many issues,\u201d Rouda said in an interview with ABC News when asked to explain why the congressman\u2019s record on Russia is important in the race. \u201cThere are so many issues that show Rohrabacher in an extremist position.\u201d\n\nHe compared Rohrabacher\u2019s views on Russia to some of his comments on other subjects, such as when he told a realtor's conference in May that it is acceptable not to sell homes to gays and lesbians, and skepticism of climate change.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rouda\u2019s campaign also sent out a statement drawing attention to spending from Atlas PAC on Rohrabacher\u2019s behalf. The group has links to George O\u2019Neil, a member of the Rockefeller clan and conservative donor, who was in touch with alleged Russian agent Maria Butina as she sought to network in Washington, according to court papers.\n\nThe two were in contact over email, planning \u201cfriendship and dialogue dinners\u201d between Russians and Americans.\n\nO\u2019Neill\u2019s interactions with Butina, according to the government\u2019s filings, largely focused on email correspondence in which he, Butina and Erickson contemplated and planned \u201cfriendship and dialogue dinners\u201d between Russians and Americans, one of which he hosted before the 2017 National Prayer Breakfast at upscale Washington restaurant Bistro Bis.\n\nO\u2019Neill wrote about the dinner on a conservative website, saying it involved \u201cformer and current and Russian officials with a number of prominent U.S. Republicans and conservatives.\u201d\n\nAfter ABC News published a story on the congressman, Rep. Rohrbacher said he did not remember speaking with Butina at the Bistro Bis dinner.\n\n\"Her job was arranging chairs at a dinner, a gopher, and I sat at the opposite end of the table,\" Rohrabacher said.\n\nRohrabacher defends record\n\nIn the interview with \u201cThe Circus,\u201d Rohrabacher repeated his disbelief that hackers backed by the Kremlin hacked the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign, citing evidence he says he was shown by Assange.\n\n\"I know they didn't hack the DNC,\" he said. \"I went to the guy who received the DNC emails, Julian Assange, and talked to him personally, and he assured me that it wasn't and that he had proof.\"\n\nThat claim has put him at odds with the intelligence community and Mueller, after the Justice Department announced indictments against 12 Russian intelligence officers for the hacking last June, ahead of Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nRohrabacher said he believes his constituents see through the criticism of his record on Russia.\n\n\u201cMy constituents are smart enough to know [bull] when they hear it,\u201d he told \"The Circus.\" \u201cI am advocating for cooperating with Russia where we can and when it\u2019s mutually beneficial.\"", "NATO has held its largest military exercises since the end of the Cold War.\n\nCalled Trident Juncture, the war games are being held over two weeks in Norway and involve 50,000 troops, 10,000 vehicles, 250 aircraft and 65 ships from 31 nations.\n\nNATO officials say that the defensive exercises are not directed at any country in particular, but it is clear the intended audience is Russia.

Investigators said Beierle apparently had no prior connection to the yoga class and that he lived in Deltona, Florida, about 250 miles from Tallahassee.\n\nBeierle had been employed as a substitute teacher with the Volusia County, Florida, School District until May 25, when he was accused of misconduct at a middle school, officials said.\n\n\"He was immediately let go,\" Kelly Schultz, a school district spokeswoman, told ABC affiliate station WFTV in Orlando.\n\nSchultz said Beierle had been issued a teaching certificate in July 2015 by the Florida Department of Education and that he passed all federal and criminal background checks. He was hired by the Volusia County School District in January 2017.\n\nBeierle had served in the U.S. Army from 2008 to 2010, according to military records. Prior to enlisting in the Army, Beierle taught English and social studies at a high school in Fort Meade, Maryland, said Bob Mosier, spokesman for the Anne Arundel Public School District in Maryland.\n\nCourt records show Beierle had several run-ins with police.\n\nHe was charged in 2016 with battery after he allegedly slapped and grabbed a woman's buttocks at an apartment complex swimming pool, according to records. The charges were eventually dismissed after Beierle complied with conditions of a deferred prosecution agreement.\n\nBeierle was also charged with battery in 2012 when he was accused of grabbing another woman's rear in a Florida State University campus dining hall, records show. Beierle denied grabbing the woman, according to an FSU police report.\n\n\u201c \u201d I don't know if [the gun] jammed or what was going on, but...that's when I picked up the only thing nearby to hit him with, which was a vacuum cleaner, and I hit him over the head.\n\nFlorida State University president John Thrasher expressed condolences to the victims' families in a statement.\n\n\"There are no words to express the shock and grief we feel after learning of the deaths of Maura Binkley and Dr. Nancy Van Vessem,\" Thrasher said. \"To lose one of our students and one of our faculty members in this tragic and violent way is just devastating to the FSU family.

Special Envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths.\n\nThe war between the Houthis, supported by Iran, and the Yemeni government, boosted by U.S. allies Saudi Arabia and the UAE, has killed at least 16,200 civilians, sparked a deadly cholera outbreak, and now brought 14 million people to the brink of famine, according to the United Nations.\n\nThere may have been a breakthrough this week, however, when the U.S. called for a ceasefire within 30 days and all parties to come to the next round of U.N. peace talks.\n\nBut there is some concern the new demands could be pushing for too much too quickly.\n\nMohammed Huwais/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTwo sources said Special Envoy Griffiths has expressed doubts about how helpful a new resolution is or whether it could be an obstacle by demanding unrealistic conditions like a complete cessation of hostilities. In an interview Friday, he hinted at that reservation himself, telling CNN, \"I don't want to see us getting stuck on things that are difficult to put together... A nationwide ceasefire is obviously a wonderful and marvelous thing... but I don't want to make that the precondition for consultations and talks, which we hope to hold later this month.\"\n\nThe U.N. does already have a resolution in place from April 2015 that demands \"all parties in the embattled country, in particular the Houthis, immediately and unconditionally end violence.\" Some believe an additional resolution is unnecessary.\n\nIn fact, the U.K. Minister of State for the Middle East Alistair Burt told Parliament on Tuesday, \"Passing a ceasefire resolution risks undercutting the U.N. envoy's efforts to reach a political deal and undermining the credibility of the Council.\"\n\n\"As soon as the right opportunity arises, we will bring forward a resolution,\" he added.\n\nThat opportunity may have come hours later when the Trump administration announced a shift in its policy -- what the president of the International Rescue Committee called \"the most significant breakthrough in the war in Yemen in four years.\"\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nWhile both sides in the nearly four-year-old war have been accused of war crimes, the Saudi-led coalition has been accused of indiscriminately bombing civilians and even targeting civilian infrastructure to exacerbate the humanitarian toll. Still, the Obama and now Trump administrations in the U.S. have supported the coalition militarily with mid-air refueling for warplanes, conducting reconnaissance, and providing training.\n\nThat support shifted, at least slightly, on Tuesday, when Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for an immediate end to hostilities in back-to-back statements. Mattis said the U.S. wanted to see the parties \"around a peace table based on a ceasefire, based on a pullback from the border and then ceasing dropping of bombs\" within 30 days.\n\nPompeo echoed that in a statement two hours later, calling for the Houthis to first stop threatening Saudi Arabia and the UAE and then those two countries to halt their airstrike campaign.\n\nHouthi leadership hesitantly welcomed the statements on Thursday. But senior rebel leader Mohammed Ali al-Houthi rejected the sequencing the U.S. laid out, saying they should \"translate their desire to bring peace in Yemen into action, stop the bombing of Yemenis immediately, and lift the siege on Yemen,\" according to the Associated Press.\n\nThat may be why, instead, Griffiths said \"the urgent need now\" is \"downing the temperature of the war while we move towards talks.\" There is a push behind the scenes now to do that, he added, such as by opening a humanitarian pipeline for relief aid -- a smaller scale step that the British may push for the U.N.

If it all comes down to that decision for some voters, was it worth it? Yup. Reporter: No regrets? No. I have no regrets. Reporter: Her Republican opponent, Kevin Cramer, is banking on a Kavanaugh bounce. We are fortunate that Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed even without one of our senators voting for him. Reporter: But Heitkamp says this race comes down to the issues that most impact the rural voters here, like health care and the economy. But now, in the fight of her political life, she told me this.
