["Three war-trophy bells seized by U.S. troops over a century ago got a send-off back to the Philippines on Wednesday by U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis, who called the controversial decision to repatriate them an important gesture of friendship between the two countries.\n\nSome veterans and officials in the U.S. oppose returning the Bells of Balangiga, calling them memorials to American war dead. But Filipinos revere the bells as symbols of national pride.\n\nU.S. Army soldiers took the bells after an attack killed 48 American troops in 1901, during the U.S. occupation of the Philippines. Two of the Bells of Balangiga are at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, and the third is with the U.S. Army in South Korea.\n\nPhilippine presidents including current President Rodrigo Duterte, have repeatedly called for the bells' return. Now, President Donald Trump's administration has agreed that bolstering the U.S. relationship with a key international ally outweighs concerns at home, even among Republican political allies.\n\nMattis marked the start of a several-week process to return the bells to a church in the Philippines with a visit to the two bells at F.E. Warren. With him was the Philippine ambassador to the U.S, H.E. Jose Manuel G. Romualdez.\n\n\"History reminds us that all wars end. In returning the Bells of Balangiga to our ally and our friend, the Philippines, we pick up our generation's responsibility to deepen the respect between our peoples,\" Mattis said in a ceremony at the base.\n\nSoldiers from the Philippines fought alongside U.S. troops in World War II, the Korean War, Vietnam War and in the recent struggle against international terrorism, Mattis pointed out.\n\n\"To those who fear that we lose something by returning the bells, please hear me when I say that the bells mark time, but courage is timeless,\" Mattis said.\n\nThose opposed to returning the bells include Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead, a Republican. Mead took part in the ceremony even as he sides with U.S. veterans who worry that returning the bells could lead to the repatriation of any number of items serving as memorials to American war dead.\n\n\"We know you and the president have looked at this, and the highest priority of the military of course is national security,\" Mead told Mattis at the gathering of a couple hundred Air Force officers, personnel and family members. \"We absolutely need to build those friendships.\"\n\nWyoming's all-Republican congressional delegation also opposes the bells' return, saying in a joint statement released by Sen. Mike Enzi spokesman Max D'Onofrio that repatriation would set a dangerous precedent for other veterans' memorials in the U.S.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Mead Gruver at https://twitter.com/meadgruver", "Authorities say 44 frozen dogs and 130 live dogs were found at a New Jersey home that reeked of animal feces and urine.\n\nState police say 65-year-old Donna Roberts was charged with animal cruelty following an inspection Tuesday at her Shamong Township residence in the Philadelphia suburbs.

Dozens of U.S. soldiers were massacred in the town on Sept. 28, 1901. At the time, it was considered the Army's worst defeat since the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876.\n\nThe decision to return the bells -- which have been a source of contention in U.S.-Filipino relations -- was first announced by the U.S. Embassy in Manila last August.\n\n\"We return these bells with consideration of our present, but also with the utmost respect for our past, one of shared sacrifice as co-equal brothers in arms,\" Mattis said Wednesday during the ceremony at Francis E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming where two of the three bells are located. The third bell, housed at a U.S. Army museum in South Korea, will also be repatriated.\n\nThe Defense secretary paid homage to the Filipino soldiers who fought alongside Americans in World War II and the Korean War and recognized the nation's current stand against the fight against ISIS.\n\n\"In this world that is awash in change, ladies and gentleman, we recognize the 117 years of enduring friendship between our people and comradeship in some of the toughest fighting in our nations\u2019 history,\" Mattis said.\n\n\"To those who fear we lose something by returning the bells, please hear me when I say this: bells mark time, but courage is timeless,\" he added. \"It does not fade in history\u2019s dimly lit corridors...\"", "Transcript for Dramatic shootout between sheriff's deputy and suspect caught on video\n\nAnd yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

Older versions of the compound are turning up in dangerous levels in drinking water supplies around the country.\n\nDrinking water contamination has been the main concern cited by public health officials and regulators in connection with the compounds, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalyl substances, or PFAS.\n\nThe EPA findings said animal studies show the so-called GenX nonstick compound has the potential of affecting the kidneys, blood, immune system, liver and developing fetuses following oral exposure. \"The data are suggestive of cancer,\" the draft report said.\n\n\"Toxicity is only one piece of information that public officials consider when determining whether there is a risk to public health,\" the report said. \"Other factors, such as exposure, must also be considered.\"\n\nLee Ferguson, an environmental analytical chemist and associate professor at Duke University, said those findings would mean \"the compounds that we're replacing toxic compounds for are also toxic.\"\n\nConcern over GenX, used in Teflon and other materials, has been strongest in North Carolina. Authorities have found it in water supplies serving hundreds of thousands of people downstream of a Chemours Co. plant that makes it outside Fayetteville.\n\nWednesday's draft findings suggest chronic exposure to GenX is dangerous at levels as low as a few hundred parts per trillion, Ferguson said. Two older versions from the same family of compounds \u2014 taken out of manufacturing in the United States \u2014 have been found to be dangerous at less than a hundred parts per trillion.\n\nPFAS are used in nonstick coatings on things ranging from pans to fast-food wrappers, as well as firefighting foam. Federal toxicology officials determined recently that the two phased-out versions of the compound are dangerous at levels far lower than previously known. An unidentified White House official in an email released through open-records laws called that finding a \"potential public relations nightmare\" earlier this year.\n\nChemours media representatives didn't immediately respond to a phone call and email seeking comment on the EPA report.\n\nU.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, a Republican whose district stretches into the Fayetteville area, said he looks forward to the completion of a pending EPA management plan that the agency says will help guide state and local governments.\n\n\"I encourage swift action to help the state better understand what we need to do going forward to keep our water clean and keep our citizens safe,\" he said in a news release.\n\nIn one of the North Carolina areas dealing with GenX contamination, New Hanover County public health director Phillip Tarte said he was reviewing the report, calling it an important step.\n\nThere are no federal health standards for GenX. The EPA classifies it as an \"emerging contaminant\" needing research.\n\nThe chemical is related to other fluorinated chemicals including PFOA, which has been blamed for causing health problems. In February 2017, Chemours and DuPont \u2014 which spun off Chemours two years ago \u2014 agreed to pay nearly $671 million to settle thousands of lawsuits related to the release of PFOA from a Parkersburg, West Virginia, plant more than a decade ago.\n\nThe EPA held a series of hearings on the contaminants earlier in the year. State and local officials and others used the hearings to urge the agency to take the lead in regulating the compounds.\n\nActing EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement Wednesday that the \"EPA is delivering on its commitment to provide our state and local partners the tools and information they need to address PFAS.\"\n\nThe EPA will now seek 60 days of public comment on its findings.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDrew contributed from Raleigh, North Carolina.", "Stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily Wednesday:\n\nPG&E Corp., down $7.13 to $25.59\n\nPeople who lost their homes in California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire sued the utility for negligence and blamed it for the fire.\n\nTahoe Resources Inc., up $1.07 to $3.27\n\nThe company is being acquired by Pan American Silver Corp. in a stock-and-cash deal valued at more than $1 billion.\n\nSnap Inc., down 23 cents to $6.48\n\nThe company behind Snapchat received federal subpoenas related to a class-action lawsuit stemming from its 2017 initial public offering.\n\nMacy's Inc., down $2.57 to $33.22\n\nInvestors are concerned that the department store chain may have difficulty keeping up its streak of sales gains.\n\nCanada Goose Holdings Inc., up $5.87 to $64.45\n\nThe high-end coat maker reported earnings and revenue that beat analysts' forecasts.\n\nBlue Apron Holdings Inc., down 5 cents to $1.17\n\nThe meal-kit seller reported revenue that came up short of forecasts and announced a restructuring.\n\nWix.com Inc., down $1.96 to $89.35\n\nThe cloud-based web development company sank despite reporting earnings that beat analysts' estimates.\n\nCimarex Energy Co., up $2.19 to $86.57\n\nEnergy stocks rebounded as crude oil prices snapped a 12-day losing streak.", "bad url", "The Latest on CNN and the White House (all times local):\n\n6 p.m.\n\nA District Court judge says he will announce Thursday whether to grant a restraining order to force the White House to return the press pass of reporter Jim Acosta.\n\nJudge Timothy Kelly heard arguments Wednesday from lawyers for CNN and the Justice Department.\n\nAcosta has had tense exchanges with President Donald Trump and Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

Signs of unity emerging from the hill as well that will be kind of fun later on but to kick us off today wanna dig into this unfolding. Extraordinary deployment of US active duty troops along the southern US border with Mexico something we haven't seen in recent memory. Quinn was just back from there. And we'll talk about that warrant a second but the Defense Secretary gen Mattis making a visit today to those troops 5600. American active duty troops down in the borders the pictures just coming in here to ABC news. Of the Defense Secretary green. Did the troops there who I have as you can see. I have a full fledged operation laundry. Machines they've they've got trucked in some gas units they've got tent cities going up there to house those troops. Many of them likely to be on the southern border through the Thanksgiving holiday. Secretary of defense Jim Mattis address reporters and said it's a moral obligation that they have Nicholas. Border security as part of national security. Our units are in position to enable. The Border Patrol to law enforcement operation. We determined the mission went absolutely legal and it has also reviewed by Department of Justice lawyers. It obviously a moral and ethical vision to support our border patrolman. So moral ethical Mitt mission Quinn you're just back from camp Donna. Where secretary Madison's today what's happening on the ground there where you see. We'll extraordinary deployment I think he's an advance DeVon is really the best way to describe this troops I talk to their couldn't really. Dried direct comparison for summing like this. We heard it being described as similar to when the army response to a natural disaster in terms of them providing just logistics to support CBP. But at this far as the base camp goes. That is a sprawling tent town that was popped up there by the military. Like you mentioned they've got laundry service says they've got tense they have got medical services just like the ones you see in Afghanistan right down there I mean. Some of this video you shot and are bringing to us as our viewers are seeing here. What did you see them actually doing there's been a lot of debate about the utility of having these troops on the border. What what's their job so the the biggest mission is is to support CBP is so that's. Laying down con concertina wire that barbed wire that he's he has at border checkpoints or they're shoring up. The ports of entry themselves. He said we are shown some video earlier that he doll go border crossing at the small border town that they've. Beefed up an extra barbed wire are also adding more bear years to pleases in between those ports of entry. And they're prepping all that stuff at the camp that mess was visiting. It and you. I had an opportunity to talk to meet with some of the Border Patrol agents who are in theory benefiting from this. Massive show of back up if you will from the military do they feel like this is. This is helpful to the hammers it sort of too many cooks in the kitchen with you all on the border. I will say the bill take all the support they can get because they're gearing an extremely difficult job down there there at Mehmet that these ports of entry there amass capacity with the people they already have coming. So it's not so much a reinforcement problem it's more of a just processing problem for them they get backed up on a daily basis with people claiming asylum just the regular flow. And and that's where really they candies that now. It's great to have your reporting their let's bring in our Elizabeth McLaughlin over at the Pentagon she is tracking. The impetus for this deployment president trump pointing to that caravan of migrants moving after Central America. Wind understand several hundred have already arrived at the border a few more thousand on the way but. Elizabeth perhaps the latest on what we know about where they are annual what what we do what we know what these so called invasion that the president. Height to head of. While seven your right I mean the secretary Mattis was asked about this as he was heading down to a border what is the threat. And he pointed to the caravans that are coming. There were about 350 migrants that arrived in Tijuana and that's right across the border from C and Diego yesterday. Another approximately 400 today. And that's according to local officials though they have arrived there they're going to rest they're going to receive some legal counsel. And then they would slowly begin the process likely of applying for asylum and that's what Quinn was just talking about that's still the legal process. At those ports and tree is to apply for asylum and that can take. Weeks so they could be waiting in these areas for awhile it's important to note that you know Mattis was down in the border in. Taxes at camp Donna but we're seeing most of these caravans moving to Tijuana in that region to California so. Large border what NASA is looking out was really Far East and read the many of the migrants are headed is really far last. So the migrants already showing up at showing up at him to be clear Elizabeth that established. Ports of entry they don't appear at least at this stage to be crossing illegally a large numbers Catherine the president had raised the Specter of this massive invasion but it's that doesn't seem to be materialized. No it doesn't and that also begs the question. I'm with the caravan and I'm talking about the images that he's seen on on Fox News whether this was all fear mongering before. Before the midterm elections really haven't heard and lamb talk too much about it really since then but Elizabeth one thing I was struck by a sitting in your note that you pour it was that. I'm a soldier and on the border was asking manna specifically about his short term plans amber says his long term plans for for Border Patrol and for their mission what exactly any sane and. Yeah and turns the short term I think mission Catherine ME they're really they're working in that concertina wire they're backing up CDP. There really isn't an answer right now to the long term mission and secretary Mattis told reporters and told those aren't soldiers they're going to be down their through Thanksgiving. On their right now set to leave an about mid December but they could be extended on this is an and military mission. One thing heat what did also not have an answer on is the cost of this missing admission that still something that we are waiting for. Here at the Pentagon and sending that Mattis really against that it. They're they're looking to gather all those costs they're keeping track of them but they don't have an estimate right now. Right Elizabeth McLaughlin force at the Pentagon thank you so much quit Nolan thank you very much for your reporting as well meanwhile. Up on Capitol Hill members of congress coming back after a break they are tracking what's going on the border of the border wall big part of that discussion but. This week has really been about welcoming new members in the party's retooling. Offering new divided congress that will come officially in January we've seen pictures here of the freshman class. Taking pictures today as those members come in for an orientation. On both sides and we have had at least on the Republican side. Both in the senate and the house some elections they have elected new leadership headed into the new year. Let me be very clear. If their agenda is simply. Investigations. Impeachment. And not focused on the hardworking American public. Will be there defend the American. All right so Republicans drawing a line in the sand against the expected onslaught of democratic led. Investigations in the new year let's bring in. I'm new democratic member of congress who will be joining that team come January congressman elect Joan goose joins us live from Capitol Hill he's been. Newly elected congressman from Colorado's second district the first African American. We should add elected to congress from Colorado and also one of the youngest members of congress at 34 years old Joan and it was. Great to have you with us wall like give us your early impressions of freshman orientation on Capitol Hill and any surprises so far. Get plenty also first thing keeper kept her out loud music on your program. It's it's a hopeful time I think for this country and certainly visiting with my fellow members of the freshman class. It's hard to come away from it with a real sense that their better days ahead for our country I think voters in this country sent a pretty resounding message in the the freshman class that they elected this past week and so. In my conversations it's pretty clear that we're all ready to get to work. Ready to get to work you've heard Kevin McCarthy there the Republican. A leader sound a warning against investigations are investigations of top priority for you. What's topped your list what would you tell your democratic leader to do. Yes oh. Think they certainly are we want to be clear and the congress has a constitutional duty. To engage in critical oversight of the executive branch in this administration. It's a duty that day the prior congress really abandoned and so that that is not something we're going to skirt from. I'm I think that the democratic majority and should be bold and making sure that work. A holding this administration accountable that being said. I also think this is a lot of policy proposals that we could potentially bridge the gap between both political parties and actually get something done for the American people. I think we can you know issue. I had Q2 gunmen walked the same time sure. And Joseph let me ask let's let's get into that a little bit you used during the campaign talked a lot about how impeachment should be one of the priorities and UN support moving forward on that. And do you do would you support articles of impeachment if they were brought today is that something you think should happen right out of the game January. You know I would it's and I made it pretty clear during a campaign that I thought there was sufficient evidence. At this juncture that it certainly I have seen and to begin impeachment proceedings that that was going to be important process for the congress. To engage can come of course now that we're gonna have I have national lot of conversations in the caucus and within you know that the house more broadly about the timing in and so forth but yeah I something has to support. How about health care and it's and they've been a top issue for voters the entire campaign certainly in your race you talk a lot about it. And you're one of the Democrats who supports a single Payer model what some are calling Medicare for all. Where do you put we're give us your your sense of the early prospects for that effort in the democratic led house do you think that that. We'll have some legs in the early days. I think so I'm you know I'm an eternal optimist perhaps that young and naive but I think got. I think if there is reason to be optimistic in part because of the incredible freshman class but that was just elected and all the apparently died seen suggests that. The American people strongly support a universal care system. They're obviously a variety of different legislative vehicles could be could pursue to get their Medicare for all is something and I certainly support an impassioned about. As one of those potential vehicles and there are a lot of new freshman. Members represented blacks who also support Medicare for all who I think are going to be meeting that drama next congress. And that's certainly an effort that I'm looking forward to being part up but again in a policy in and ultimately progress is Peter. There are a lot of things I think we can do in health care space to deliver for the American people and certainly people it in my district the second congressional district where. Folks are paying some of the highest health insurance rates in the country with respect to the individual exchange so I'm making some key changes to the Affordable Care Act perhaps increasing subsidies for. Rural areas and mountain communities. Those are conversations and I really would like. The authority and of course one person who will get to largely dictate. What those priorities are which where your party knows what comes to the far will we be the new speaker of the house. A lot of debate a monster party just this week over Nancy Pelosi whether she has the support. Offering that where do you stand on Nancy Pelosi do you support her will you support her in a house floor vote to be the next speaker. Don't look like it's important question I don't think he told I'm keeping an open mind for having a lot of conversations. Some of what you just alluded to with you know my fellow members of the freshman. Class and and we folks in leadership not just your policy but also many other folks who comp you know constitute the leadership team in the house. The talk to them about their vision for. The democratic majority and in the work that we should be engaged in over the course of the next two years so I'm looking forward to continuing those conversations and then and ultimately make a decision that that I think is in the best interest of the people of the second congressional districts don't have made a final decision yet. All right Joan Andrews noncommittal on Nancy Pelosi and an eternal optimist your optimism is infectious it's great to meet you Joseph thanks for joining us here in the briefing room on ABC news. Those to play through. And let's bring in our senior congressional correspondent Mary Brewster break that down a little bit more and provide some analysis. On the new congress merry great to have you up on Capitol Hill let's start with. We're Joseph left off on Nancy Pelosi is battle to be speaker. You bank are tracking the latest. In support and opposition to her what do we know about whether she has the votes. Interesting the way he walked that fine line there and look congressman accused is in good company there are planning of his. Fellow freshman Democrats who have yet to make up their mind and plenty of them. Who have said that they will not will never vote for Nancy Pelosi by our count that list is somewhere north of fourteen members could be. Up there around the twenties. In terms of numbers over a Democrat to say they simply cannot back the speaker they want. New blood they feel that that position cannot be held by Nancy Pelosi. But what's important to note Devean is that those who oppose anti Pelosi have yet to put up. Another candidate. What they think would do a better job than Pelosi so what she is still trying to get the votes she is. You know working things behind the scenes she's reaching out to new member she's calling in. Lot of big guns some of her political allies to make the case for her as well and I just would say even though. Right now she is still working to get north of 218 that's the number of votes that she needs to become an ex speaker of the house. I would. Really cautioned against underestimating Nancy Pelosi she is a fiercely against Eaton and negotiator shares of the sharpest elbows. Of any want. Appear on Capitol Hill and she knows better than anyone how to win votes and she is confident she told us again today she is 100% certain that she will be the next speaker of the house even have right now the numbers don't appear to be in her favor. And what's driving in that Mary for people who have followed polo sees long storied career. And are wondering why she has is a such a low approval rating new polls out today just 17%. Americans have a favorable approval of her that's a CNN poll but also this as you're still talking about and in her own party. Why is that why is she become. Much maligned by some. It's a really good question and I think there are several different factors at play here one is simply bet there's a desire to rein in some new blood today that you need someone. To come in and shake things up that they look at the party they they feel that things have not been. Heading in the direction they want it and they want new leadership. Doesn't remember the name to blows he's been a favorite target of the right to you we look back think backed out as campaign ads only hours dean just a week ago arguably the in the weeks since the mid terms. But but that she was a target for so many Republicans and in a lot of districts where you saw a lot of Democrats having to come out and say that they wouldn't standard Nancy Pelosi either. And that those arms many of those members now stills and that they can't support Lizzie are those who ran on that platform. I don't remember the that we now have the most diverse that congress and our history and a lot of people feel that bad that leadership needs to reflect the diversity. Invaded and it's time for for a bit of a change at the top because of that. And people are looking to the Democratic Party in a different direction especially all you'll talk to many new more progressive members. Feel that that it's time for a shake up so a lot of this get to the broader dynamics at play over the future of the Democratic Party. And I think a lot of people that feel that the party needs to go to different direction are those who are now saying I mean maybe it's not not now time for Pelosi to point out. It's going to be a tense leadership fight for the house Democrats we know you're gonna stay on top of that neighbors think you so much for joining us or for that analysis you found Mary's. Latest reported abcnews.com and of course coming up. On world news tonight I'm moving on the White House. Is also experiencing some of these winds of change around town after the election season in Catherine fall there's has the latest there. Long rumors of a senior staff shakeup in president trumps cabinet and senior staff we've been hearing this time and again in the march to the election it's happened. We seem to be on the cusp of something big rightly so we lost Jeff Sessions. The day after the mid terms and it we reported a yesterday that the president is again revived this talk of replacing his chief of staff John Kelly. Who has pledged to stay there quite funny but he's considering other options nick Ayers as vice president's chief of staff and also. Here's senior citizen lose today on here's a Nielsen yup you haven't the president just gave an interview to the daily caller and he had this to say. It was an interview in print that the president did say that he. It has is going to make this is short. Shortly Brett he was asked specifically about his Homeland Security secretary it was with mass ave the border today. Well how Long Will she be around Willy fire you see the quote right there and he's look he's looking at things he hasn't made a decision he says -- make it shortly. And it is resembles a little bit of his reaction to Jeff Sessions to when reporters were constantly asking about sessions he said. Come amid a decision yet but from my cabinet is great so. This is someone he is chief with for a long time particularly the issue of immigration is fascinating to seek your stimulus and at the border today with those aviator glasses looking top. But the president it's it's very clear increasingly clear has had it with her. Absolutely and John Kelly his chief of staff is is trying to find her some time over at the department but you're right they have sparred on immigration and Nielsen has sparred with John Bolten his national security advisor on immigration as well so it's happening and knew their feud and. And before you move on what's the latest on this feud between the deputy. National security advisor admirer of her cart all. And the first lady's office we saw yesterday and talked about here in the brief hearing that extraordinary statement by the First Lady saying she should be removed him and yet she still on the job today in the west went. A yes the First Lady release a statement on the record from her communications director saying. John Bolton is deputy near a record out should be removed. Now there's a statement right there and were told that she is actually apple work today despite the First Lady calling. A for her ouster is behind this do we have a sense get a in reporting why is she disliked but you know it's a good it's a good question we reported that I'm from our sources that we've talked to that she sparred with a number of people. In the west wing. Madness. Kelly Bolton and real personality personality. Our sources are taught us eight it's our key phone calls emails. So there really is saying it you know it it just has to do with her personality really among. The agency is deputies at agencies but that an unnamed official yesterday said. Coming to her defense and always saying what the firstly hasn't even Matt Kerr but again in house to do really with the staff of the first lady's office. All right little bit of apprentice style low yeah. Out of the and of the year in the west wing. I'm he model west wing is keeping a close eye on what's going on in Florida the outcome of midterm elections still lingering in several places let's bring in. Our Chris good joins us from New York political reporter an election expert who has been with her decision to ask. Tracking the latest on the recount fund Florida Chris. Give us the headlines we heard today there were some overheated. Dallas County machines and things seem to fall apart yet again where we're anything stand in Florida.

But it's really open air what's gonna happen as a court fight now over these deadlines and it's really unclear when this is going to be resolved. Unclear what's going on in Florida but also in Georgia. Close race there as well what do we know about the Georgia governor's race for the Georgia governor's race that's that's a state where the race was. Extremely close and you have two candidates who will. Who will continue to fight that out even after Election Day and say it's one of the number of races is still yet to be decided we saw the same. Drama sort of put out in Florida with things going on be on Election Day obviously see Stacy Abrams there it was hope.

Over Jeff Caplan follows with us great to have you with fascinating briefing room follow wasn't BBC news after an abcnews.com. We'll be right back here tomorrow at 3:30 eastern time to bring him. Until then I'm Devin Dwyer we'll see you next time.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Transcript for Black college student escorted out of class for allegedly having feet up\n\nAnd yeah.

A yeah.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Sometimes losing is winning.\n\nOr at least that's what some of the 18 North American cities passed up by Amazon for its new headquarters are telling themselves.\n\nAfter 14 agonizing months of wooing and then waiting for the online retail giant to make up its mind, the finalists learned that instead of Amazon picking one location for its new offices, it would split them between Long Island City in Queens, New York, and Arlington, Virginia, in suburban Washington, sending an estimated 25,000 jobs to each.\n\nThe places that didn't make the cut are bearing the rejection with a mixture of reflection, disappointment and some optimism. But while they're missing out on the economic boost \u2014 for now \u2014 they've also dodged having to give away billions of dollars in tax incentives.\n\nAmazon's search for a new home resulted in some 238 suitors from across the continent that the company in January whittled down to 20, stretching from Toronto to Miami in the east to Denver and Los Angeles out west.\n\nThe prospect of new jobs and the cachet that comes with a tech behemoth like Amazon led many cities to pull together aggressive tax incentive packages worth billions of dollars, among other enticements.\n\nNewark, New Jersey, for instance, proposed $2 billion in tax incentives along with a potential $5 billion put up by the state.\n\n\"I think considering the size of the tax package we were offering, I think a lot of taxpayers are taking a sigh of relief,\" said Brandon McKoy, who heads government and public affairs at the progressive think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective. \"It was very exorbitant.\"\n\nThe other finalists were: Atlanta; Austin; Boston; Chicago; Dallas; Denver; Indianapolis; Montgomery County, Maryland; Nashville; Pittsburgh; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Washington.\n\nSome economic development experts argue that giving up billions in tax revenue through incentive programs was a flawed mindset from the start.\n\nRichard Florida, an urban development expert at the University of Toronto, cast Amazon's search in stark terms, suggesting the company \"played\" cities against each other to get the best deal, while also scoping out potential future locations for business hubs.\n\nHe compared the selection process to the televised talent competition, \"American Idol.\"\n\n\"We can get back to doing economic development the right way, not through these Amazon Idol competitions,\" he said.\n\nNew York offered Amazon more than $1.5 billion in tax credits and other incentives while Virginia and Arlington ponied up about $573 million.\n\nBut the tax incentives were not the only factor for Amazon. Indeed, the chosen sites had offered less than other places. Amazon has said it picked locations best suited to attract the high-skilled workers it's seeking.\n\nThat's small consolation to places left to soul-search what they could have done differently.\n\n\"We competed hard, we competed well, but we did not succeed,\" said Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings, whose city was a contender. \"It calls upon us, as leaders in this city, to look hard at ourselves and say, 'Why can we not beat New York City and Washington, D.C.?\"\n\nOthers cast the loss in a positive light.\n\n\"It put Philadelphia in the national (and international) spotlight \u2014 increasing our visibility to other companies and showing our viability for other large-scale projects,\" said Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney in a statement.\n\nFor all the time and energy expended on the process, there's also a sense of relief to finally be done with it, even if the outcome for most wasn't as hoped.\n\n\"I'm glad it's over,\" said Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. \"It's just a lot of anxiety, a lot of waiting.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Jamie Stengle and Jim Anderson contributed to this report.\n\npho", "Creating fire buffers between housing and dry brush, burying spark-prone power lines and lighting more controlled burns to keep vegetation in check could give people a better chance of surviving wildfires, according to experts searching for ways to reduce growing death tolls from increasingly severe blazes in California and across the U.S. West.\n\nWestern wildfires have grown ever more lethal, a grim reality that's been driven by more housing developments sprawling into the most fire-prone grasslands and brushy canyons, experts say. Many of the ranchers and farmers who once managed those landscapes are gone, leaving neglected terrain that has grown thick with vegetation that can explode into flames when sparked.\n\nThat's left communities ripe for tragedy as whipping winds and recurring drought that's characteristic of climate change stoke wildfires like the ones still raging in Northern and Southern California that have killed at least 51 people in recent days.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people were told to leave their homes ahead of the blazes to get out of harm's way. Yet some experts say there's been an over-reliance on evacuation and too little attention paid to making communities safe, as well as not enough money for controlled burns and other preventive measures.\n\nSearch crews found many victims inside their vehicles, or just next to them, overcome by flames, heat and smoke as they tried to flee. Survivors of the blaze that nearly obliterated the Northern California town of Paradise and nearby communities spoke of having just minutes to escape and narrow roads made impassable by flames and traffic jams.\n\n\"There are ... so many ways that can go wrong, in the warning, the modes of getting the message out, the confusion ... the traffic jams,\" said Max Moritz, a wildfire specialist with the University of California Cooperative Extension program.\n\nAs deadly urban wildfires become more common, officials should also consider establishing \"local retreat zones, local safety zones\" in communities where residents can ride out the deadly firestorms if escape seems impossible, Moritz said.\n\nThat could be a community center, built or retrofitted to better withstand wildfires, which can exceed 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, leaving little trace of ordinary homes.\n\nSuch fire protection measures in buildings can include sprinklers, fire- and heat-resistant walls and roofs, and barriers that keep sparks out of chimneys and other openings, according to the International Code Council, a nonprofit that helps develop building codes used widely in the United States.\n\nCreating more buffers \u2014 whether parks, golf courses or irrigated agriculture, like the vineyards that helped keep 2017 wildfires in California's wine country from spreading into even more towns \u2014 around new and old housing developments would help stave off wildfires threatening to overrun cities and towns.\n\nSo would burying electric power lines, which can spark and fail in the high winds that drive many of California's fiercest fires, said Jon Keeley, a research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey in California.\n\nSparks from electrical utility equipment are suspects in the Northern California wildfire that consumed Paradise, destroying some 7,700 homes, and other deadly blazes in the state.\n\nA proven method to prevent wildfires from getting out of control is the use of controlled burns. By intentionally lighting fires, property owners or land managers can remove dead and low-lying trees and brush \u2014 material that otherwise accumulates and can accelerate the growth of fires.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, California ranchers burned hundreds of thousands of acres annually to manage their lands, said Lenya Quinn-Davidson, director of the Northern California Prescribed Fire Council.\n\nThat was phased out in the 1980s after California's fire management agency stepped in to take over the burns, and by the last decade, the amount of acreage being treated had dropped to less than 10,000 acres annually, Quinn-Davidson said.\n\nFormer agricultural land that rings many towns in the state became overgrown, even as housing developments pushed deeper into those rural areas. That was the situation in the Northern California town of Redding leading up to a fire that began in July and destroyed more than 1,000 homes. It was blamed for eight deaths.\n\n\"You get these growing cities pushing out \u2014 housing developments going right up into brush and wooded areas. One ignition on a bad day, and all that is threatened,\" Quinn-Davidson said. \"These fires are tragic, and they're telling us this is urgent. We can't sit on our hands.\"\n\nThe latest California fires have fueled debate over the reasons for ever-more deadly wildfires, with President Donald Trump claiming in a tweet Saturday that \"gross mismanagement of the forests\" was the sole reason the state's fires had become so \"massive, deadly and costly.\" He also threatened to withhold federal payments to the state.\n\nHowever, most of California's deadly fires of recent years have been in grasslands and brushy chaparral, Keeley said.\n\n\"Most of the fires we've been seeing in the last couple years that are the most destructive are not in the forest. Thinning isn't going to change anything,\" he said.\n\nTrump's assertion also ignored the huge federal land holdings in the state and brought a quick backlash, with the president of the California firefighters union describing it as a shameful attack on thousands of firefighters on the front lines.\n\nTo ease tensions, the White House sent Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to tour fire-damaged areas and offer assistance to California Gov. Jerry Brown.\n\nIn an interview prior to the two-day visit, which began Wednesday, Zinke struck a conciliatory tone and said federal officials share blame for not managing public forest and rangelands aggressively enough.\n\n\"We need to work in unison to make sure we thin the forest, especially fire breaks, and make sure we have prescribed burns,\" Zinke told The Associated Press. \"There's been a lack of management on Interior lands, on U.S. Forest Service lands and certainly with state lands.\"\n\nBut it's California, not the Trump administration that is putting more money behind such efforts.\n\nIn response to the deadly blazes of recent years, California lawmakers in September approved a measure that would provide $1 billion over five years for fire protection, including more controlled burns and projects to thin forests and brush land.\n\nBy contrast, federal spending on hazardous fuels reduction has been flat in recent years, hovering just under $600 million, even as direct firefighting costs jumped to a record $2.9 billion last year.\n\nFor 2019, the Forest Service has proposed a $3 million bump for its wildfire fuels program. At Interior, Zinke proposed a $29 million cut in fuel management spending.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKnickmeyer reported from Washington.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Matthew Brown on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MatthewBrownAP", "Transcript for Newly elected House members arrive on Capitol Hill\n\nLet's bring in a new democratic member of congress who will be joining that team come January congressman elect Jonah goose joins us live from Capitol Hill he's been. Newly elected congressman from Colorado second district the first African American. We should add elected to congress from Colorado and also one of the youngest members of congress at 34 years old Joseph noose. Great to have you with us wall like give us your early impressions of freshman orientation on Capitol Hill and he any surprises so far. Get plenty also first thing keeper kept her out loud music on your program. It's it's a hopeful time I think god for this country and certainly visiting with my fellow members of the freshman. The class. It's hard to come away from it with a real sense that it their better days ahead for our country I think voters in this country sent a pretty resounding message in the the freshman class that they elected this past week and so. In my conversations it's pretty clear that we're all ready to get to work. Ready to get to work you've heard Kevin McCarthy then a Republican. Leaner sound a warning against investigations are investigations of top priority for you. What's topped your list what would you tell your democratic leader to do. Eight yes I think they certainly are Melanie be clear and the congress has a constitutional duty to engage in critical oversight and the executive branch in this administration. It's a duty to fit the prior congress really abandoned and so that that is not something we're going to skirt from. I'm I think that the democratic majority I should be bold and making sure that work. Holding this administration accountable that being said. I also think this is a lot of policy proposals that we could potentially bridge the gap between both political parties and actually get something done for the American people. I think we can you know issue. I hit you chew gum and walk at the same time. Sure and Joseph let me ask let's let's. Get into that a little bit you used during the campaign talked a lot about how impeachment should be one of the priorities in UN support moving forward on that. Do you do would you support articles of impeachment if they were brought today is that something you think should happen right out of the game January. You know I woods and I made it pretty clear during the campaign that I thought there was sufficient evidence at this juncture that that certainly I had seen. And to begin impeachment proceedings that that was going to be important process for the congress. To engage and come of course now that we're gonna have I have national lot of conversations in the caucus and within you know that the house more broadly about the timing in and so forth but yeah I'd something has to support. How about health care and it's a Ben Bennett top issue for voters the entire campaign certainly in your race you talk a lot about it. And you're one of the Democrats who supports a single Payer model what some are calling Medicare for all. Where do you put we're give us your your sense of the early prospects for that effort and the democratic led house do you think that that. We'll have some legs in the early days. I think so I'm you know I'm eternal optimist perhaps that young and naive that I think got. I think if there is reason to be optimistic in part because of the incredible freshman class but that was just elected and all the apparently died scenes suggests that. The American people strongly support a universal care system. They're obviously a variety of different legislative vehicles that we could pursue to get their Medicare for all something and I certainly support and impassioned about. As one of those potential vehicles and there are a lot of new freshman. Members represented blacks to also support Medicare for all who I think are going to be beating that drum in the next congress. And that's certainly an effort that I'm looking forward to being part of but again in a policy in and ultimately progress is Peter. There are a lot of things I think we can do in health care space to deliver for the American people and certainly people. It in my district the second congressional district where folks are panes of the highest health insurance rates in the country with respect to the individual exchanged. I'm making some some changes to the Affordable Care Act perhaps increasing subsidies for rural areas in mountain communities those are conversations and I really would like. The apart and of course one person who will get to largely dictate. What those priorities are which for your party knows what comes to the far wolf will be the new speaker of the house. A lot of debate amongst your party just this week over Nancy Pelosi whether she has the support. Offering that where do you stand and Nancy Pelosi do you support her will you support her inane. House floor vote to be the next speaker. Yeah look like it's important question I don't think he told I'm keeping an open mind for having a lot of conversations. Some what you just alluded to with you know my fellow members of the freshman. Class and and we folks in leadership not just leader Pelosi and also many other folks who comp you know constitute the leadership team in the house. To talk to them about their vision for. The democratic majority and in the work that we should be engaged in over the course of the next two years so I'm looking forward to continuing those conversations and end and ultimately make a decision that that I think is in the best interest of the people of the second congressional districts don't have made a final decision yet. All right Joan Andrews noncommittal on Nancy Pelosi but an eternal optimist your optimism is infectious it's great to meet you Joseph thanks for joining us here in the briefing room on ABC news.

Marcia Fudge, a veteran Ohio Democrat, bluntly called for a challenger to step up and face off against Pelosi. Though she flirted with the idea of taking on Pelosi herself, she emphasized that she is looking for someone else to step forward.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear I\u2019m not going to be voting for the current leader,\u201d Fudge said. \u201cI don\u2019t plan to run, but there are a number of people who I think are capable. And so we are exploring, talking to those people.\u201d\n\nBut Fudge would not slam the door on a potential bid herself.\n\n\u201cI never really thought much about it to be perfectly honest. I would say this, as we tout diversity in this party, there\u2019s no diversity in our leadership. As we talk about the base of our party \u2013 black and brown \u2013 there are no black and brown people in our leadership,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to talk about it, we\u2019re going to talk the talk, we need to walk the walk.\u201d\n\nRep. Tim Ryan, an ally in the quest to identify an alternative to Pelosi, floated Fudge as a possibility, stressing he wants the Midwest to have a seat at the table.\n\n\u201cThere are several candidates out there that are great candidates that you know we have a very talented caucus, a lot of talent, and we just have to figure out who it\u2019s going to be, you know, if anybody,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBut you know we\u2019re going to bring change. The people want change.\u201d\n\nWhile Rep. Steny Hoyer has announced he has at least 155 Democratic signatures in support of his bid for majority leader, he refused to predict whether his play for the number two position could unravel if Pelosi\u2019s campaign for speaker falls short.\n\n\u201cEverybody likes to talk about personalities. [What\u2019s] much more important to the American people are the policies that we pursue,\u201d Hoyer, D-Md., said. \u201cThe personalities will take care of themselves but the policies is what we\u2019re going to really focus on.\u201d\n\nWith several incoming Democratic freshmen vowing to oppose Pelosi on the campaign trail, many are now tight-lipped about the allegiance, waiting to see whether any contested races emerge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of listening, learning and navigating to do,\u201d Rep.-elect Dean Phillips told ABC News. \u201cI\u2019ll be visiting with [Pelosi] later this week, and a number of others, and like I said, listen and learn.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am uncommitted. I\u2019m not sure if there will be other candidates putting themselves forward, but I want to be fair,\u201d Rep.-elect Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., said. \u201cI haven\u2019t met with the leader as of yet. We\u2019re going to be sitting down.\u201d\n\nJoseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI have not declared, and I\u2019m really looking forward to understanding fully who\u2019s running and what their agenda is and if it\u2019s aligned with the best interests of the families across Illinois\u2019 14 district,\u201d said Lauren Underwood, D-Illinois.\n\nRep.-elect Jeff Van Drew stressed he made a commitment to supporters and \u201cI\u2019m going to keep that commitment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI come from a tough district, that requires a lot out of me, and I give it back to them. So when I tell you or my constituent, when I tell them something, I stick to it, Van Drew, D-N.J., said. \u201cWe\u2019re a big tent and it makes the party look good if we have different ideas.\u201d\n\nOther veteran Democratic lawmakers have also refused to publicly endorse or oppose Pelosi.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll resolve that in the coming weeks,\u201d said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Oregon, throwing up his hands in defense of an onslaught of questions about the speaker\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cWhat a pleasant problem to have,\u201d Rep.

Add Russia Investigation as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia Investigation news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nRepublican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware attempted to force a vote on a bill that would prevent Mueller from being fired without \u201cgood cause.\u201d\n\nTheir efforts came in light of Jeff Sessions being forced out of his post as attorney general last week and the subsequent appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general.\n\nIn his new role, Whitaker takes Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein\u2019s place as the lead overseer of the Russia probe. Sessions had previously recused himself of all Justice Department activity related to the investigation into Russian meddling. Now, lawmakers are concerned that Whitaker\u2019s objectivity is compromised because of his vocal criticism before joining the administration.\n\nFlake and Coons sought unanimous consent from their Senate colleagues for the measure late Wednesday but that failed after an objection from Republican Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nThe bipartisan Mueller protection legislation formally named the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee in April but has seen no floor action.\n\nThe bill codifies existing DOJ regulations to ensure that the special counsel can only be fired for good cause by a Senate-confirmed DOJ official. Whitaker has not been confirmed by the Senate for his current post.\n\nIt also provides the special counsel with a 10-day window in which he can seek expedited judicial review of his removal to determine whether the firing was for good cause. If the firing is ultimately determined to have violated the good-cause requirement, the special counsel cannot be removed.\n\nLastly, the bill would preserve the staffing, documents, and materials of the investigation while the matter is pending.\n\n\u201cThe leader has always said 'there\u2019s no need for this because nobody's been fired, the special counsel is fine.\u2019 But I don\u2019t think anyone can say that after Jeff Sessions\u2019 forced removal,\u201d Flake told ABC News on Tuesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, he followed up his remarks by threatening retribution on Senate Republicans to withhold his vote on judicial nominations.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\n\"I have informed the Majority Leader that I will not vote to advance any of the 21 judicial nominees pending in the Judiciary Committee, or vote to confirm the 32 judges awaiting a confirmation vote on the floor, until [the bill] is brought to the full Senate for a vote,\" Flake announced on the Senate floor after McConnell objected to the measure.\n\nHis decision to withhold his vote on judicial nominations would draw ire from McConnell, who has previously said confirming judges to federal courts is a top priority.\n\nMcConnell has downplayed the necessity of the Mueller protection bill, saying the bipartisan legislation is not needed at this time because of assurances he has been given by President Trump that he does not intend to fire Mueller.\n\n\u201cI mean there's been no indication, as you can imagine \u2013 I talk to the president fairly often \u2013 no indication that the Mueller investigation will not be allowed to finish, and it should be allowed to finish,\u201d McConnell told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nHe went on: \u201cWe know how the president feels about the Mueller investigation but he has never said he wants to shut it down. I've never heard anybody down there say they want to shut it down. I think it's in no danger and so I don't think any legislation is necessary.\u201d\n\nBut several other Republicans have said they would vote for the bill, including Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Maine Sen. Susan Collins, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis.\n\nGraham told ABC News on Tuesday: \u201cWe bring it to the floor I\u2019ll definitely vote on it. I don\u2019t see any movement to fire Mueller, but legislatively it\u2019d probably be good to put it into law for the future.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Graham told CBS News\u2019 Face the Nation that he doesn't think Whitaker should recuse himself from overseeing Mueller's investigation. He also said he intends to meet him sometime this week.\n\nAt least one Republican said he thinks the Mueller protection bill would be unconstitutional and he said he doesn\u2019t think Whitaker will do anything to jeopardize the Mueller investigation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to the man to bash him before he even has a chance to find the men\u2019s room,\u201d Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana said Tuesday.\n\nDemocrats, however, are insisting that if a standalone bill does not get a chance on the Senate floor, then it must be included in a must-pass spending bill due by Dec. 7.\n\nSchumer on Tuesday said that Democrats will \u201cattempt to add legislation to the must-pass spending bill in the lame duck session that will prevent acting Attorney General Whitaker from interfering with the Mueller investigation.\u201d\n\nGrassley, who\u2019s charged with overseeing the DOJ as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, on Tuesday insisted he felt reassured by Trump\u2019s assurances on the matter.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that the president's the chief executive and the president said that he wasn't going to do that, so doesn't matter what Whitaker thinks,\u201d Grassley told reporters.\n\nGrassley also said that as long as Whitaker made comments about the Mueller probe as a \u201cprivate citizen\u201d he\u2019s not concerned about any bias he may have.\n\nOn the bill to protect the special counsel investigation, Grassley said he supports it.\n\n\u201cThe answer is if it comes to a vote, I will vote for that bill. Whether it comes for a vote is up to the Leader and I respect the leader's right to bring it up,\u201d Grassley said.", "A large, drop-shaped natural pearl pendant sold for more than $36 million Wednesday at a rare auction of jewelry that once belonged to French Queen Marie Antoinette, which Sotheby's is calling a record price for a pearl at auction.\n\nThe \"Queen Marie Antoinette's Pearl,\" a diamond-and-pearl pendant, was among the highlight offerings on the block at the Sotheby's sale of jewelry from the Bourbon-Parma dynasty in Geneva.\n\nSotheby's billed the sale as a once-in-a-lifetime chance to scoop up heirlooms and jewels that have been held in the Bourbon-Parma dynasty for generations. Some of the Marie Antoinette jewelry hadn't been seen in public for 200 years \u2014 until now.\n\nLike many of the 10 former Marie Antoinette pieces up for sale, the pendant obliterated the pre-auction estimate \u2014 in its case, $1 million to $2 million. It sold for a hammer price of 32 million Swiss francs ($32 million), but with the buyer's premium and fees, the total sale rose to more than $36.1 million.\n\nThe buyer wanted to remain anonymous, the auction house said.\n\nAll told, the Marie Antoinette pieces reaped nearly $43 million.\n\nThe diamond and pearl jewelry of Marie Antoinette that went under the hammer epitomized the aloof, pre-Revolutionary opulence of French royals brought down by the uprising. The wife of King Louis XVI, she was executed in France's revolutionary fervor in 1793.\n\nBefore falling to the guillotine, she had secretly smuggled abroad some of her most treasured possessions to her relatives amid rising the revolutionary fervor that ultimately marked the beginning of the end of France's centuries-old monarchy.\n\n\"The Marie Antoinette pendant is simply irreplaceable,\" Eddie LeVian, CEO of jewelers Le Vian, said before the sale. \"This is about far more than the gems themselves: Marie Antoinette's jewelry is inextricably linked to the cause of the French Revolution.\"\n\nThe queen's jewelry also included a set of pearl and diamond earrings, a diamond brooch, and a natural pearl and diamond necklace. A monogrammed, diamond-set ring bears a lock of Marie Antoinette's hair.\n\nNearly all of those lots far outstripped the pre-sale estimates, a testament to the difficulty in assessing the value of such rarely available jewels.\n\n\"It was really the Bourbon-Parma factor, plus certainly the Marie Antoinette factor,\" said Daniela Mascetti, Sotheby's chairman for jewelry in Europe. \"Prices really rocketed. Some items sold for, I think, 20 or 25 times more than the presale estimate.\"\n\nAdded Andres White Correns, senior director for jewelry: \"We had said when we did the press conference for this sale that this was going to be the sale of this century \u2014 and I think that the results tonight prove that this is the case.\"", "Transcript for Troye Sivan says his new movie has a message for parents\n\nto this,\" and now he's bringing his acting and musical talents to the powerful new movie \"Boy erased.\" He plays a young man forced to undergo gay conversion therapy and gives co-star Lucas hedges tips on how to survive. Take a look. Play the part. Show them it's working, you're getting better. Fake it until you make it, right? You don't want to end up in one of those houses for any length of time. I've heard the stories and they're not good. That's where you're likely going to end up. Sarah's already there. So, play the part, man. Then once you're home, you got to figure out what to do next. Please welcome troye Sivan. ??? So, for those of you -- for those of you who don't know, I'm going to give you a little background. You started singing and posting videos on YouTube when you were 12. Hm-mm. And since then your life has kind of changed a bit. You have over 9 million social media followers and youalbum, and you performed on \"Saturday night live.\" How's all this feeling? I mean, it's crazy. Very, very, very often I take a moment to kind of pause and think about how I would have felt if I could show myself like five years ago what's going on now, you know? I really try to do it as often as I can because it's like at this point it feels like every day I get to do something that, um, you know, I could have only dreamt of a long time ago. So it feels good. Speaking of things you could have dreamt of, I understand you are a big fan of Taylor Swift and last summer you performed at the rose bowl with her. How did that come about and what was that like? So originally -- Look at you guys. The strut. Originally it was me just asking if I can get tickets to the show. Wow. Then she said yes, if I perform with her. So yeah, before I knew it, I was under the stage and did the whole popup thing. The popup thing is the best, right? Yeah, with the smoke, so good. So when you were 18 you came out publicly, correct? Yes. And also on YouTube. Yep. The interesting thing about coming out at that point was you were about to sign a record deal which could have possibly, you know, thwarted your career but you decided to do it. Why? Because of that exact reason actually. I at that point, thankfully, was sort of secure enough in myself and confident enough in myself that I knew that it was like a necessity for me to come out. I decided that I couldn't live without being completely truthful and open and honest. So I didn't want to ever give anyone that power to say no, don't come out right now because it will be bad for sales or whatever, I don't know. I just wanted to kind of completely take that in -- You took a risk. You took a risk and it worked. I'm so happy I did it. It paid off. It did. Let's talk about your new movie \"Boy erased\" which is such an incredible film. It's so nuanced. It's a true story, actually, based on the best selling book by Garrard Conley about his time at a gay converse camp. It has a great cast, you, Nicole kidman, Russell Crowe. You said you hope this movie speaks to parents in particular. What should it say to parents? So I think the thing that I learned while on this movie, while working on this movie, it kind of surprised me. I wasn't nearly as angry as I thought I was going to be at the parents who send their kids off to these programs. And I think the reason is because you see this family, it's a family story and they're just scared. They're really, really scared for their kid. Because they love him. They love him a lot and they want to do what they think is right so they turn to the people that they trust the most which is their faith and they think that they're doing the right thing. What I'm hoping is that this movie is going to kind of play out what happens when you send your kid to conversion therapy and you get to from the comfort of a movie theatre or your own home watch how that works out for so many people. Hopefully by the end of the movie you'll see that it is absolutely not the way to go about things, you know. Well, in fact, the leader of the conversion camp that the real Garrard -- is that how you say his name? He left in 2008 and is now married to a man. So that's ironic and interesting. Right. The other part of the movie that we just saw a clip of where you're saying to this other boy, just play dumb, make believe you're converting. Yeah, yeah. Is that a fact, does it happen like that? Yeah, I mean, I think honestly kids are lucky if they make it out alive, you know. It leads to depression and anxiety and suicide a lot of the time. It's still happening in 36 states across the U.S. That's what was fascinating to me because they explore that at the end of the movie, that it's still legal and it's still going on. Totally. I'm shocked by that, I got to tell you. I grew up in a really religious environment and community where this is still going on. Like it's emotional to even see this movie and to talk about it. You would think it was made in the '90s but this is still so real. I had friends who took their life because parents think they can change them. They think they can take the devil as they called it out of them and turn them into somebody else. I think what you're doing is so, so powerful and it's going to impact more lives than you realize. But you not only did this film, you were making an album at the same time called \"Bloom.\" Did your perspective change when you finished filming and finished making that album? Completely, yeah. I mean, I kind of was almost done with the album and had to put it on pause to go film this movie. Really, really immersed myself in the movie for the time that we were filming and then when I was finished with it I was so just relieved. It felt like the biggest weight off my chest that I consider myself so unbelievably lucky that I get to go back to my big gay life and make this gay album. You know, it's like -- That's because you have parents who understood you. I think for lots of -- I think for lots of parents having a gay child is problematic for them because they don't want to say the wrong thing. They don't know how they're supposed to act because a lot of this is brand new for folks and then you get into gender diversity and people are kind of like so -- you know, parents have to understand, you know, we've all gone through this -- or maybe not everybody but I know a whole bunch of people have. You know someone who has gone through it. You know someone who has. It's also important to say this movie really holds people's hands through that process, you know what I mean? It's very patient. It doesn't point fingers at anyone, doesn't villainize anyone. I really think everyone should see it. I hope they will. And the great thing is that these parents actually love their kid. That's the bottom line. You have to come back. I want to, please. Any time. So, you need to see -- I'm sorry, my bad. Our thanks to troye Sivan.

Terrence O'Shaughnessy, head of U.S. Northern Command.\n\nTHE MISSION: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen visited the U.S.-Mexico border in Donna, Texas, to inspect work by some of the thousands of soldiers deployed by Pres.

More than 7,000 active duty troops are expected to be fully deployed in Arizona, California and Texas ahead of the arrival of the migrant caravans.\n\n\"The eyes of the world, and certainly all of the Americans, are on you,\" Mattis told soldiers during his tour of Camp Donna.\n\nSome military analysts have speculated that the deployment could end up costing as much as $200 million, but Mattis told reporters traveling with him that he was not able to provide a preliminary cost estimate because the information was still flowing into the Pentagon.\n\n\"So we can estimate costs all we want,\" said Mattis. \"I prefer to give you real costs.\"\n\nFour migrant caravans were making their way through Mexico to the U.S.\n\nSeveral hundred migrants from the first caravan arrived in Tijuana on Tuesday where they are expected to rest and receive legal advice before approaching the border crossing at San Ysidro to request asylum.\n\nLast week President Donald Trump signed an executive order that only allowed asylum requests to be made at formal ports of entry, a change of existing law that allows asylum requests anywhere on the border.\n\nMigrants from a caravan that left Mexico City earlier this week and are now headed to the border crossings near Tijuana, 1,500 miles to the northwest. That was a change from the expected route to McAllen and Brownsville, Texas, a much shorter distance.\n\nMattis acknowledged the location of the caravans arrival was a \"dynamic situation\" but said \"we can move the troops back and forth.\"\n\n\"Right now the only thing we\u2019ve been asked for is to put in obstacles, provide transportation and to provide housing,\" said Mattis, reiterating that the soldiers' mission along the border is one of support.\n\n\"I do not anticipate military personnel coming into direct contact with migrants,\" said Mattis.\n\n\"I\u2019m a hundred percent confident we have the number of troops at each of those ports of entry to complete what we\u2019ve been asked to do prior to the arrival of the large caravans.\"\n\nDefense Sec.

He has also not used the term \"invasion.\"\n\nLast week, Mattis instructed that the name \"Operation Faithful Patriot\" be dropped and instead refer to the deployment as a border support mission. He explained he did not want to risk misinterpretation by using military terminology to describe a mission supporting another agency.\n\n\"I do not want to put this mission in some arcane military terms if what we are doing is laying wire,\" said Mattis. \"I want to talk to the American people because this is a highly politically visible issue and I want you to tell them what you\u2019re doing.\"", "Transcript for Melania Trump calls for firing of top security aide\n\nAnd speaking of parties, there could be a bunch of farewell parties at the white house pretty soon. Parent first lady Melania trump made a very unusual public statement declaring that deputy national secretary adviser Mirra ricardel no longer deserves the honor of serving in the white house. Melania apparently thinks ricardel is leaking information and clashed with her over her trip to Africa. I guess people are saying is she overstepping her bounds by making it public? Is this just more smoke and mirrors? What's happening? I like when she says she no longer deserves the honor. Tell that to Michael Cohen, Sean spicer. See how honored they were to work in this white house. Half of them are being indicted for god's sakes. If they're not quitting or getting hired, they're going to jail. Some honor. I was surprised to see this because historically you know that first ladies do tend to work behind the scenes and have complaints about people and they have certainly their husband's ears. Hillary Clinton in the west wing -- clearly George Stephanopoulos has written about that. Nancy Reagan too. Mary Todd Lincoln, a long history of it. But there isn't a history of a first lady putting out a public statement, an official statement saying something-like that. I don't know if it's because her husband sort of conducts his business that way in the open or maybe it's the age we're in. Maybe she's jealous of all the drama and she wants to be in the middle of it too. Nothing about this white house has Normal precedent. President trump doesn't even fire people. Remember he tweeted about James Comey and James Comey found out when he was on a trip in California. It sounds like behind the scenes Melania trump has been trying to get this woman out because this happened during the Africa trip is when it started. That was weeks ago, a couple months ago. It sounds like a clash between her and John Bolton who is this woman's boss and she feels the only way to be listened to is to go public which is strange. Isn't it odd for the first lady to do this. I don't know what's worse, leaking or doing it publicly. That's how I roll. I'm a straight shooter. If I have a problem I'm not going to leak stuff. The one thing I will say is the Africa trip as we talked about on this show wasn't totally received globally. We talked about the pith helmet, the controversial attire. If this woman is telling her something she doesn't want to hear, maybe she should start listening to things you don't want to hear. You got to surround yourself with people who aren't going to be yes men telling you what you want to hear every day. To that point, why isn the person who encouraged her to wear that jacket on her way to the border, I don't really care, do you -- she should fire herself. What Melania has accused this woman of is leaking and where I would disagree with Meghan a little bit is this white house is famous for leaks and the people that are in that white house, they still haven't gotten control of that. There has to be frustration with Melania. What are you trying to say, whoopi? I was going to make a really terrible joke and you can't make it. Everyone in the white house leaks everything. That's the problem. It's the root of all problems in all organizations when you're trying to build morale anyplace. If you have a leaking problem, it will fester like a virus. We've often talked about how people in this white house aren't necessarily qualified for the positions that they have and that's been very problematic. But this woman, I did some research and she does appear to be qualified for her position. She's been the deputy national security adviser for seven months but she also attended Georgetown university school of foreign service, did doctorate work at tuft's university and she's held three positions -- It doesn't matter if she's Albert Einstein. Melania doesn't like her. She appears to be qualified for her position.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "A utility accused in a lawsuit of igniting California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire said it contacted a customer about a power line on her property but that sparks were not part of the discussion.\n\nPacific Gas & Electric Co. said it had been in touch with Betsy Ann Cowley to inform her about future planned work on a power line that had been shut down.\n\nCowley has said the utility emailed her last Wednesday, a day before the blaze ignited, about getting access to her property in her tiny private resort town of Pulga to work on lines.

In his 2018 race to represent West Virginia\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, Ojeda came up short behind the Republican candidate but managed 43.6 percent of the vote. The previous Democrat running in that district lagged 23 points behind that number in 2016.\n\nOjeda told the podcast he voted for Trump in 2016 largely because of his promise to restore the coal industry, which would help families in his district.\n\n\u201cWhen I look around where I was from, I saw people that were struggling greatly and I know that you now I got back to the coal industry. I come from the coal fields,\u201d Ojeda said. \u201cAnd he was the one that was talking about helping the people to be able to put food on the table to feed their families.\u201d\n\nSince 2016, though, Ojeda has been critical of Trump and the president hasn\u2019t shied away from firing back.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has returned the favor by going to West Virginia and calling you \u2018a total wacko\u2019 and \u2018stone cold crazy,\u2019 Klein said. \"What do you call President Trump back when he says things like this?\u201d\n\nLeah Millis/Reuters\n\n\u201cWell, you know I called him \u2018President Bone Spurs,\u2019\u201d Ojeda said. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy that has no problems using veterans as props. But you know, here on Veterans Day, didn\u2019t have the guts to visit Arlington National Cemetery where people pay the ultimate sacrifice ... we\u2019re talking about somebody who obviously thinks that he\u2019s better than everybody.\u201d\n\nOjeda received national attention during his campaign, owing in part to his unique backstory and physical presence. He says that although he failed in his House bid, he can still draw broad support in a run for president because he is a Democrat that cares about the working class.\n\n\u201cIf you look at middle America and the reason why it\u2019s so red is because the Democratic Party cannot relate to them. They definitely have not done anything to support people from where I come from in West Virginia,\u201d Ojeda said. \u201cThe letters and things like that that we received educated me that the problems we have in southern West Virginia are the same problems that we have all across the United States of America.\u201d\n\nMichael MathesAFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe first pillar of his campaign, he says, is combating corruption. Ojeda wants to make sure that those elected to federal positions are willing to sacrifice in order to relate to their constituents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying right now that if you\u2019re going to serve this nation in a federal position you need to start proving that you\u2019re willing to sacrifice first. I\u2019m saying ... that people are sick and tired of the millionaires running the system,\u201d Ojeda told Klein and Karl.\n\nThe results of the midterm elections in the House seem to reflect that sentiment. They\u2019re also causing a stir in the White House, as Trump questions what his next moves will be.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s a bit emboldened by the results. I think that\u2019s why you saw the abrupt firing of Sessions,\u201d Karl said of the election. \u201cThere is a churn, there is an uneasiness that I am sensing in the West Wing. The president feels restless to me. There are a lot of triggers that you feel are about to be pulled, but aren\u2019t pulled.\u201d\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is on her way out of the Trump administration, according to Karl\u2019s sources, which could lead to a shuffle of other administrative positions, Karl said.\n\n\"Powerhouse Politics\" also talked with ABC News correspondent Paula Faris about her new podcast \"Journeys of FAITH with Paula Faris.\" Faris launched the podcast on the premise that faith plays a large role in most everyone\u2019s lives, but is rarely talked about in the public sphere.

Enabled by Postmates delivery as a service, we were able to quickly set up a pilot program that explores how our self-driving vehicles can complement Walmart\u2019s existing delivery offerings,\" Ford Autonomous Vehicles director of business development Brian Wolf wrote in a Medium post.\n\nWalmart has been using Postmates to delivery grocery items picked by the retailer's personal shoppers, which will be available in 800 stores in 100 metro areas in the U.S., Wolf wrote. By next year, the number of stores offering delivery is expected to double.\n\nThe partnership to use self-driving cars for delivery, ahead of, say, commuting, was a good way for Ford to get into the autonomous game without too much risk, experts said.\n\n\"Doubling down on the commercial side of self-driving technology is a safer bet for Ford, but could be one that pays off well in the end. Solving commercial challenges is far easier than solving commuter ones, and is most likely the area where self-driving technology will take off first,\" Jeremy Acevedo, Edmunds manager of industry analysis said in a statement.\n\n\"People may not be willing to trust a self-driving car to take them somewhere, but if the car is going to bring things to them and make their lives a little easier, suddenly the technology is a lot less scary,\" Acevedo added.\n\nThe Ford grocery delivery program will launch in Miami, where the company has already completed 1,000 deliveries, Wolf wrote.

Many appeared to have been shot in their sleep, and one of the women was found lying in bed with a 4-day-old baby.\n\n\"All eight victims were killed in cold blood,\" DeWine, who is now Ohio's governor-elect, told reporters Tuesday. \"They were shot in their own homes. They were brutally and viciously executed.\"\n\nThe 4-day-old was one of three children, along with a 6-month old and a 3-year-old, that were found unharmed at the three crime scenes, police said.\n\nOhio Attorney General\n\nDeWine accused the Wagners of spending months carefully planning the murder of the victims, who he characterized as friends of theirs.

They face additional charges, including, conspiracy, engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, tampering with evidence, unlawful possession of a dangerous ordinance, aggravated burglary for allegedly breaking into the homes to carry out the murders, unauthorized use of property, obstruction of justice, interception of wire, oral or electronic communications and forgery for allegedly forging child custody documents, according to DeWine.\n\nWhile the attorney general did not discuss the motive of the murders, DeWine said the custody of a young child \"plays a role in this case.\"\n\nOhio Attorney General/Pike County Sheriff\n\n\u201c \u201d The Wagners eagerly look forward to their trials, and to have their day in court so they can vindicate their names ...

Searches in the other winner of Amazon's sweepstakes, Crystal City, Virginia, jumped 84 percent. Real estate agents say they're hearing from investors who'd like to become landlords and from sellers who've decided to pull their homes off the market, sit back and wait for prices to go up, up, up.\n\nThe surge of interest has followed Amazon's selection of those two areas to each receive 25,000 new jobs paying an average of $150,000.\n\nThe two localities already reflect the ultra-pricey New York and Washington metro areas, though real estate sales there had been relatively modest of late. Worries are arising, in fact, that housing prices in both places\u2014 whether for renters or buyers \u2014 are destined to price out all but the most affluent in the coming years.\n\nThe same trend, critics note, has long been evident in such high-tech centers as San Francisco, San Jose, California, and Seattle, where Amazon is based. In those cities, low- and moderate-income families increasingly struggle to afford housing anywhere near their workplaces.\n\nOut of concern that Amazon's arrival could make homes prohibitively expensive, buyers around Crystal City are suddenly rushing to close on sales, said Brian MacMahon, a real estate agent with Redfin in Northern Virginia.\n\nEnvisioning a stream of rising rental income, investors are calling from as far as California to inquire about buying homes they could rent out or just let appreciate in value, MacMahon said. Two sellers have just pulled listings from the market, he said, so the homes could be re-listed next year, presumably at higher prices, after the market adjusts to Amazon's arrival.\n\n\"When we have nice stuff coming onto the market, it's flying off the shelf,\" MacMahon said.\n\nBy choosing the New York and Washington areas, Amazon has inadvertently thrown a spotlight on the gulf between a small group of thriving but high-cost U.S. cities and the rest of the country. Housing in Amazon's two new hubs are well more than twice the median home price nationwide of $255,000, according to ATTOM Data Solutions.\n\nThe median price in Arlington County has surged 12.5 percent so far this year to $585,000. In Queens County, the median has risen 7 percent to $630,000.\n\nAmazon executives were drawn to the sizable pools of well-educated and skilled workers in the two areas, which they chose over 18 other finalists with housing that has generally been less expensive.\n\n\"Home affordability was not a prime deciding factor for Amazon,\" said Daren Blomquist, senior vice president of ATTOM.\n\nIn some ways, Amazon had injected adrenaline into a New York City market where price growth had exceeded wage gains to the point that sales had begun to slow. Until last weekend, real estate agents say, attendance at open houses for condos in Long Island City had been sparse.\n\nThe $1.7 million condo at the Foundry building, with its private terrace and skyscraper views, was once the kind of showcase property that triggered competing bids within a few weeks. Buyers, though, had adopted a wait-and-see stance as mortgage rates rose, luxury construction flooded the market and interest from foreign buyers waned.\n\nYet over the weekend, open house attendance in Long Island City suddenly tripled as word of Amazon's announcement became public, said Christopher Austad, a real estate broker with Douglas Elliman.\n\n\"We just caught a huge breath of fresh air \u2014 it's like someone just resuscitated us,\" Austad said. \"I've had a dozen new buyers and investors reach out this week. I've had past sellers contracting me and saying, 'Chris, we want to invest in LIC.' It's great.\"\n\nIn the Seattle area, Amazon's presence, along with that of other tech giants like Microsoft, is thought to have contributed to home values that have priced out even relatively affluent families and have left poorer residents with few options. Homelessness has worsened. Over the past five years, the median home value in Seattle has rocketed 73 percent to $739,600, according to an analysis by the real estate firm Zillow, which is also based there.\n\nPartly in response, the city approved a series of increases to its minimum wage that will reach as high as $16 an hour next year. It approved a corporate tax this year to help the homeless, though the tax was repealed after being challenged by the business community, including Amazon.\n\nAaron Terrazas, a senior economist at Zillow, said he thinks metro New York and Washington will avoid the same predicament.\n\n\"I don't think we should expect a similar jump,\" Terrazas said. \"Both New York and D.C. have demonstrated a capacity to add supply in ways that Seattle was reluctant to.\"\n\nBoth metro areas are already comfortable with building blocks of apartment and condo towers, he said. Their high-density construction makes it easier to accommodate the job growth than cities that prioritize single-family housing.\n\nThey also contain extensive mass transit networks. In theory at least, the New York and Washington subway systems can ease housing price pressures by enabling workers to spread out.\n\nStill, the benefits of mass transit depend on New York and Washington maintaining and improving their systems \u2014 a severe challenge in recent years amid breakdowns, deteriorating tracks and rising expenses in both transportation systems.\n\nYet the underlying message from Amazon's two selections is that big tech companies seem not to view housing costs as a barrier for hiring workers. Companies in Seattle and San Francisco have increasingly expressed concern that tech talent there would migrate to Salt Lake City, Boise or other cities where homes are more affordable.\n\nAmazon appears less concerned.\n\n\"There was anxiety in Silicon Valley that there are all these up-and-coming tech hubs that would challenge them,\" Terrazas said. \"What the selection of D.C. and New York underlines is how the dominant players continue to be dominant.\"", "A federal judge is expected to announce Friday morning whether he will grant CNN's request that he order the Trump White House to immediately restore a press pass to the network's chief White House correspondent, Jim Acosta.\n\nThe court hearing and announcement, originally scheduled for 3 p.m. Thursday, was delayed until Friday at 10 a.m. without explanation.\n\nDuring an emergency court hearing Wednesday, the Trump administration defended revoking Acosta' press pass, arguing that the president has the power to exclude any and all journalists from White House grounds.\n\n\u201cIf the president wants to exclude all reporters from White House grounds he clearly has the authority to do that,\u201d James Burnham, deputy assistant attorney general, argued before the judge on behalf of the president.\n\n\"We\u2019re talking about the physical White House, I mean the one building in which the president\u2019s authority over how people act, where they go, should be at his apex,\" Burnham said. The West Wing is a tight, small space, he argued, which is why journalists want to be there.\n\nCNN and Acosta filed suit against President Donald Trump and top aides on Tuesday for stripping Acosta, without warning, of his access to the White House, where he works daily. The indefinite revocation of Acosta\u2019s press credentials, known as a \u201chard pass,\u201d came on the heels of a heated exchange between Trump and Acosta on Nov. 7.\n\nCNN and Acosta filed an emergency motion to have Acosta\u2019s press pass immediately reinstated as the court case continues and asked for a ruling from Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly in federal court in Washington Wednesday afternoon.\n\nJonathan Ernst/Reuters, FILE\n\nOn Wednesday, the judge pushed CNN\u2019s lawyers on how they can prove that Acosta's press pass was revoked specifically because of the content of Acosta\u2019s reporting rather than based on his behavior, which the president described as \"rude.\" CNN's case relies heavily on Sherrill v. Knight, a 1971 case which established that taking away a journalist's press pass because of the content of their coverage is prohibited under the First Amendment.\n\nDespite months of criticism launched at CNN and Acosta, \u201cUntil this point, [the administration] took no action,\u201d U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly said in a question to CNN\u2019s lawyer, Theodore J. Boutrous, Jr. \u201cWhat triggered a content-based response here as opposed to all those other months?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was a bad day for the president,\u201d Boutrous said. \u201cIt was the day after the midterms.\u201d\n\nBoutrous said the issue was bigger than Acosta or CNN.\n\n\u201cRudeness really is a code word for \u2018I don\u2019t like you being an aggressive reporter,\u2019\u201d he said, which threatens the right of journalists to ask tenacious questions and, he argued, will have a \"chilling effect\" on the White House press corps.\n\nIt's Trump who \u201cestablishes the tenor and tone of these press conferences,\u201d Boutrous argued, and \"wants it to be a free-for-all, that's his prerogative.\"\n\n\"He is the most aggressive, dare I say rude, person in the room, and I\u2019m not being critical -- this is the rough and tumble of the presidency, and that\u2019s what the First Amendment protects,\u201d Boutrous said.\n\nThe defense argued that denying Acosta a press pass was not a violation of the First Amendment as there is no guaranteed access to the White House, and dozens of other CNN reporters with \"hard passes\" could continue to serve public interest by reporting on the White House grounds. Acosta could continue to do his job by watching video fed back from the White House, the defense argued.\n\nBoutrous called their argument a \"fundamental misconception of journalism.\"\n\n\"Different reporters break different stories. This notion that it's some minor thing to be in the White House, be at a gaggle ... to work your sources in the White House, to go talk to the government officials who are there, that is invaluable access. We have evidence, they have no evidence,\" Boutrous said, also arguing that the president can't decide who CNN sends to the White House or exercise control over who the network wants to be its chief White House correspondent.\n\n\"There's no First Amendment doctrine that, if there are a bunch of other reporters, you can bar someone else and it's not a violation,\" Boutrous said, but Sherrill v. Knight, the lawyer argued, established the opposite.\n\n\"There's an interest to ensure that no one reporter is excluded -- and it's the public's interest,\" Boutrous said. \"Maybe that's the reporter who would break the story, who would break the story wide open because of their sources.\"\n\nThe judge also asked whether the White House could act differently to reprimand Acosta without taking away his pass in full \u2014 something like not allowing Acosta in briefings with the president but letting him on White House grounds.\n\nBoutrous said that suggestion would still be a violation of First Amendment rights.\n\nManuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\nIn a brief written before the court hearing Wednesday, lawyers arguing on behalf of the president laid out the defense strategy and maintained that Acosta\u2019s credentials were taken away because he \u201cdisrupted the fair and orderly administration of a press conference during an exchange with the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Acosta\u2019s decision to engage in conduct that disrupts press events and impedes other reporters from asking questions provides a more-than-sufficient reason for revoking his hard pass,\u201d the president\u2019s attorneys wrote.\n\nThe brief focused largely on Acosta\u2019s \u201cdisrupt[tions]\u201d during the press conference rather than a previous explanation by White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, which CNN promptly denied, that Acosta had placed his hands on an intern who tried to take away his microphone. The judge declined to characterize it as a \"shift\" in narrative.\n\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\nIn the brief, Trump\u2019s attorneys argued it would be \u201cextraordinary\u201d for the court to decide to \u201cdirectly police access to the secure White House complex where the president lives and works, as well as to dictate who the President must invite to press events.\u201d\n\nMany individual journalists who attended the press conference have shared personal accounts and spoken out, defending Acosta. Major news outlets also joined together to issue a statement in support of Acosta and CNN Tuesday, and filed \"friend of the court\" briefs in the case.\n\n\u201cWhether the news of the day concerns national security, the economy, or the environment, reporters covering the White House must remain free to ask questions. It is imperative that independent journalists have access to the President and his activities, and that journalists are not barred for arbitrary reasons,\u201d read a statement issued by The Associated Press, NBC News, FOX News, POLITICO, The New York Times, The Washington Post and more.\n\n\u201cOur news organizations support the fundamental constitutional right to question this President, or any President. We will be filing friend-of-the-court briefs to support CNN\u2019s and Jim Acosta\u2019s lawsuit based on these principles,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nThe statement echoed one from the White House Correspondents' Association, which criticized the Trump White House decision and supported CNN.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who is on a tour of Asia, was asked about Acosta and press freedom after he criticized Myanmar's lack of freedom during the trip.\n\n\"This administration has stood strong for a free and independent press and defended the freedom of the press on a world stage,\" Pence told reporters in Singapore. \"There's no comparison whatsoever between disagreements over decorum at the White House and the imprisonment of the two reporters in Myanmar.\"", "Transcript for Traders react, gold leaf applied and Michelle Obama: World in Photos, Nov. 14\n\nIt's.

As of Nov. 5, 2018, 164 people in 35 states have been infected. Sixty-three people have been hospitalized and one person in California has died. The states most affected include Texas, Minnesota, Illinois and New York.\n\nConsumer Reports on Wednesday called on the USDA to list the brands associated with the drug-resistant strain of salmonella with Thanksgiving about a week away.\n\n\u201cThe USDA should immediately make public which turkey producers, suppliers, and brands are involved in this outbreak \u2014 especially with Thanksgiving right around the corner,\u201d Jean Halloran, director of Food Policy Initiatives for Consumer Reports, said in a statement. \u201cThis information could save lives and help ensure consumers take the precautions needed to prevent anyone in their home from getting sick.\u201d\n\nHowever, USDA-FSIS stated today, \"To be abundantly clear, FSIS has NOT identified a source or supplier of the product or products that are making consumers ill, but we continue to work around the clock with our federal and state public health partners to solve this.\"\n\nSalmonella infection can cause symptoms of what is commonly referred to as \u201cfood poisoning.\u201d Symptoms include fever, stomach aches and diarrhea which typically develop within 12 to 72 hours after being exposed to the bacteria. Most people recover within four to seven days without treatment. Sometimes the illness can be so severe that people need to be hospitalized; this could be for severe diarrhea leading to dehydration, or if the infection spreads from the intestines to the bloodstream and other places in the body. People at higher risk for severe illness are children under the age of 5, adults over the age of 65 and people with weakened immune systems.\n\nThe strain of salmonella causing the outbreak has been found in samples from live turkeys, raw turkey products and turkey pet food in Minnesota, the CDC said. It has also been identified in samples of raw turkey products from slaughterhouses and meat processors.\n\n\"The salmonella strain isolated from these samples is closely related genetically to the salmonella strain from ill people,\" the CDC said.\n\nThe CDC is not advising consumers to avoid eating properly cooked turkey products or that retailers stop selling raw turkey products. It recommends handling raw turkey carefully, including washing your hands before and after preparing or eating turkey. Counters, cutting boards and utensils should also be thoroughly washed to prevent the spreading of germs from raw turkey to food preparation areas. Cooking raw turkey thoroughly (to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F, measured by placing a thermometer in the thickest part of the food) will help prevent food poisoning. Feeding raw meat to pets is also discouraged.\n\nJohanna Kreafle, M.D. is an emergency medicine physician at the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.", "As John Dorsey prepares to make a critical decision he knows may shape Cleveland's fortunes, the Browns general manager spends a moment every day giving himself a pep talk.\n\nAnd a stern warning.\n\n\"Just make sure you don't mess it up, that's what I tell myself,\" Dorsey said. \"Just don't mess this thing up.\"\n\nDorsey is in the early stages of heading his first coaching search with the Browns, who have been in a futile pursuit of a competent leader for nearly as long as they've been looking for a quarterback.\n\nWith the Browns (3-6-1) on their bye this week, Dorsey provided some insight into a quest that will accelerate once the season is completed and conclude with Cleveland's ninth coach since 1999.\n\nAs expected, Dorsey said interim coach Gregg Williams will be one of the candidates interviewed. Dorsey has been impressed with the job that Williams, the team's fiery defensive coordinator, has done over the past two weeks since taking over for Hue Jackson, who was fired on Oct. 29 after going just 3-36-1 in two-plus seasons.\n\nThe Browns beat Atlanta 28-16 on Sunday and have split their two games under the 60-year-old Williams, who Dorsey feels he has provided more than stability.\n\n\"I've always been a believer of you play the game like you practice and I think these practices have been very competitive,\" Dorsey said. \"They've been very structured, they've been very disciplined, and guys have had some energy and that's the difference I see. There's been a focus on the little things which I think is important.\"\n\nWilliams has previous head coaching experience with Buffalo from 2001-2003. He was also the defensive coordinator in New Orleans from 2009-2011, when he guided a group that won the Super Bowl but was also embroiled in the \"Bountygate\" scandal that resulted in him being suspended by the NFL for one season.\n\nBesides Williams, Dorsey has been pleased with how Cleveland's offense has played under running backs coach Freddie Kitchens, who took over play-calling duties when coordinator Todd Haley was fired the same day as Jackson. Dorsey would not speculate on Kitchens' future with the team, but said he \"has done a heck of a job.\"\n\nDorsey would not divulge who else in upper Cleveland's management team will help him find a coach, but he was adamant the Browns will not hire an outside firm to assist, which is something owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam have done in the past.\n\n\"We don't need that,\" he snapped.\n\nDorsey was tight-lipped on other aspects of the search, including whether he would be willing to hire a college coach with no pro experience. However, he did outline the traits he's seeking in a new coach.\n\n\"For me personally, I would like to see a man of character,\" he said. \"I would like to see a man who can lead young men. I would like a man who has high acumen. Those are the three basic things there I'm looking for.\"\n\nDorsey promised to be as publicly quiet about the search as he was earlier this year when he kept Cleveland's No. 1 draft pick a well-guarded secret before choosing quarterback Baker Mayfield.\n\nThat selection is part of why Dorsey feels Cleveland's coaching gig is so appealing. Mayfield is showing signs of growth and along with rookie running back Nick Chubb, defensive end Myles Garrett, wide receiver Jarvis Landry and others, the Browns have a talented core of young players. The Browns also have nearly $60 million in salary cap space, a rabid fan base, 11 draft picks in 2019 and committed owners fixated on winning.\n\n\"Those are exciting things for this organization moving forward,\" he said. \"Anybody, once they understand that, you will see that, you know what? Cleveland is a good place to be.\"\n\nNOTES: Dorsey had little to say about Jackson returning to Cincinnati as a special assistant to Bengals coach Marvin Lewis. \"I wish him the best,\" he said. \"It was hard a couple of weeks ago.\" ... Dorsey would not say if he intends to interview former Arizona coach Bruce Arians, who is retired and doing TV analysis but has expressed interest in Cleveland's opening. \"I have a lot of respect for coach Arians,\" Dorsey said. \"Right now, we are in the process of beginning to finalize our plan.

She\u2019d been sober for nine years when she and her husband, Ben, decided to have a baby. Motherhood was something she wanted to feel.\n\nIf she needed an epidural during labor, Veum told her doctor, she didn\u2019t want any fentanyl in it. She didn\u2019t want to feel high.\n\nAdam Grossberg/KQED\n\n\u201cI remembered seeing other friends,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019d used it, and they were feeling good and stuff. I didn\u2019t want that to be a part of my story.\u201d\n\nAn epidural is a form of regional anesthesia given via an injection of drugs into the space around the spinal cord. It is typically a mix of two types of medication: a numbing agent, usually from the lidocaine family, and a painkiller, usually fentanyl.\n\nThe amount of fentanyl in the mix is limited, and little passes into the bloodstream, anesthesiologists say. But if a woman doesn\u2019t want the fentanyl, it\u2019s easy to formulate an epidural solution without it. Doctors either use a substitute medication or boost the concentration of the numbing agent.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no medical reason why someone should be forced to be exposed to opioids if they don\u2019t want to,\u201d said Dr. Kelly Pfeifer, a family physician and addiction expert who now works as director of high-value care at the California Health Care Foundation. (Kaiser Health News produces California Healthline, an editorially independent publication of the California Health Care Foundation.)\n\nPfeifer said there\u2019s another situation to be aware of: pregnant women who are taking methadone or suboxone to manage opioid addiction. During labor, anesthesiologists often prescribe narcotics to help manage pain, but some of those commonly used \u2014 like Nubain \u2014 can immediately reverse the effects of methadone or suboxone.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, you\u2019re in the middle of labor \u2014 which is already painful \u2014 and now you\u2019re in the middle of the worst withdrawal of your life,\u201d Pfeifer said.\n\nFor Veum, one of the worst wildfires in California\u2019s recorded history is what interrupted her birth plan. She and her husband live in Santa Rosa, Calif., and she was in active labor when devastating fires ignited nearby on Oct. 8, 2017. What are now known as the \u201cWine Country Wildfires\u201d burned more than 5,000 homes and killed 44 people.\n\n\u201cThere was a ton of smoke in the hospital,\u201d Veum said. \u201cLike you could visibly see it outside \u2014 and smell it.\u201d\n\nNurses told her everybody had to evacuate. Veum was transferred to another hospital, 5 miles away. And the special instructions for her epidural got lost in the chaos.\n\n\u201cThen, when they went to change the drug, I saw the tube said \u2018Fentanyl\u2019 on it,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd by that point I was starting to feel \u2018the itchies'\u201d \u2014 one of the familiar physical signs she would experience when starting to get high.\n\nMost women without a history of addiction wouldn\u2019t experience these sensations when given opioid anesthesia, said Dr. Jennifer Lucero, chief of obstetric anesthesiology at the University of California-San Francisco Medical Center. Anytime a woman who is not in recovery asks for an epidural without fentanyl (usually out of the mom\u2019s concern for the baby), Lucero explains why it\u2019s there.\n\nThe fentanyl allows the anesthesiologist to balance out the numbing agent in the solution, she said, so women don\u2019t have as much pain from the contractions but can still feel the pressure and are able to move their legs a bit or shift in bed during labor.\n\nOnce she explains the trade-offs, and assures women that the opioid will have no effect on their fetus, most of her patients opt to keep fentanyl in the epidural solution.\n\nBut doctors have been trying to cut down on administering opioids in other ways during labor and delivery, namely in what they prescribe for pain after the birth.\n\nFor years, women who had a normal, vaginal birth were sent home with a 30-day supply of Norco, Percocet or another opioid, Lucero said.\n\n\u201cSome people would think they\u2019re supposed to take them all,\u201d Lucero said, while other women \u201cwould not use it, and it would just be sitting in the bathroom cabinet.\u201d\n\nWhile most people who get a bottle of pills when leaving the hospital won\u2019t develop dependence or an addiction, some will. When a patient is prescribed opioids for short-term pain, the risk of chronic use starts to increase as early as the third day of the prescription, according to a report published last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A study out this year suggests that every week of opioid use increases the risk of misuse.\n\nAs recently as 2017, postpartum women were routinely being prescribed three- to five-day supplies of opioids \u2014 even after an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. A study published that year of 164,720 Pennsylvania women on Medicaid who gave birth vaginally found that 12 percent of them filled an opioid prescription after they gave birth \u2014 even though most did not have a clear medical need for a painkiller, such as vaginal tearing or an episiotomy.\n\nNow obstetricians are issuing new guidelines to patients, Lucero said, and they\u2019re trying to prescribe limited amounts of opioids, and only post-surgically, to women who have had a cesarean section.\n\nNicole Veum ended up being one of those women. After she was transferred to the second hospital during the wildfire evacuation, she spent another 12 hours in the early stages of labor, but she wasn\u2019t progressing. She agreed to a C-section.\n\nAdam Grossberg/KQED\n\nAfter the birth of her son, doctors sent her home with a bottle of Percocet \u2014 another opioid. They told her that if she was worried about being able to maintain her sobriety, she could have her husband or a friend hold on to the bottle and control the dosage.\n\nPfeifer, the physician and addiction specialist, said that in a situation like that, sending Veum home with just a few Percocet pills, or even suggesting she take only ibuprofen, would have been fine.\n\n\u201cAny parent will tell you there\u2019s nothing more stressful than the first week of being a parent and having a baby and being in sleep deprivation,\u201d Pfeifer said. \u201cAnd here you have a little bottle of Vicodin that you used to turn to, to make you feel better when you\u2019re stressed.\u201d\n\nFirst the fires. Then the fentanyl in her epidural. Then the Percocet. It was Veum\u2019s first test in seeing how her sobriety and motherhood would line up. She called a friend who was also in recovery. They talked it all through, and Veum was fine.\n\n\u201cI was OK. I was OK with it. It was just something that happened,\u201d she said as her baby, Adrian, now a year old, plays with a new toy.\n\nVeum is 32 now. She\u2019s returned to school this fall to work toward her college degree, after a 14-year break. And she is loving being a mom.\n\n\u201cA lot of people, metaphorically, felt it as a baby coming out of the ash \u2014 the life coming from the ashes,\u201d she said about her child born in the midst of the 2017 wildfires.\n\n\u201cAnd I feel that,\u201d Veum said. \u201cI feel like it was a big time for our community \u2014 and me personally \u2014 to be reborn in some way.\u201d\n\nThis story is part of a partnership that includes KQED, NPR and Kaiser Health News.\n\nKHN\u2019s coverage of women\u2019s health care issues is supported in part by The David and Lucile Packard Foundation.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Did I hear that word?\" the president said to applause from Republican lawmakers and supporters of the legislation in the room. \"That's a nice word, bipartisan agreement on prison reform legislation known as, the first step, and that is what it is. It's a first step but it's a very big first step.\"\n\nThe president said the bill would \"roll back\" certain provisions of \"the Clinton crime law that disproportionately harmed the African-American community.\"\n\nHe added that the legislation has the backing of law enforcement, including seven major police organizations.\n\n\"Their backing has ensured that this legislation remains tough on crime -- it\u2019s got to remain very tough on crime -- and supports the tremendous work of our police and the tremendous job that law enforcement does throughout our country, our communities.\n\nAndrew Harnik/AP, FILE\n\nThe president urged members of the House and Senate to work fast on getting the FIRST STEP Act pushed through, and ended by thanking his son-in-law for his work on the legislation.\n\n\"It's my honor to be involved, and it'll be an even greater honor to sign,\" Trump said, telling Sen.

We want prison to serve as a place to lock up the people who are the most detrimental to society.\u201d\n\nThe president has held back until now from putting his seal of approval on the Senate version of the legislation as he tasked his son-in-law with demonstrating that there is sufficient support among the law enforcement groups for the legislative action, according to sources familiar.\n\nKushner briefed the president on his progress on Tuesday, at which time the administration had secured endorsements from a handful of law enforcement associations, while some other groups that had actively opposed the legislation agreed to stay neutral on the legislation.\n\nA narrower version of the bill, titled The First Step Act, passed the House earlier this year.\n\nWhile the House version was focused on prison reform, the Senate language also includes sentencing reforms. There is a measure to retroactively apply updated sentencing guidelines between crack and powder cocaine, will eliminate a regulation that makes it a federal crime to possess a firearm while committing another crime, give judges greater latitude to sidestep mandatory minimums for nonviolent drug offenses, and shorten mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.\n\nThe administration\u2019s aim now is to pass the legislation through the lame duck session of Congress.\n\n\u201cYes, that's going to be the focus,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe president's leadership makes a lot of things possible.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s legislative efforts on the issue have been complicated in the past by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 strong opposition to sentencing reforms.

He is anti-left and a self-proclaimed nationalist, and he campaigned for Bolsonaro, who was elected Oct.28.\n\n\"The Brazilian foreign policy must be a part of the moment of recovery that Brazil lives today,\" the president-elect said about his appointee.\n\nAraujo has praised Trump's approach to foreign relations, saying the U.S. leader proposes a view of the West that is based on the recovery of its symbolic past. The Brazilian diplomat also believes globalism is an anti-Christian ideology.\n\nBolsonaro, a former army captain and longtime congressman, has on several occasions compared himself to Trump, although many analysts say his tough anti-crime and pro-gun positions resemble more those of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nSome diplomats were surprised with Araujo's appointment because he has never been in charge of an embassy during his 29-year diplomatic service.\n\nBolsonaro's aggressive rhetoric has already caused tensions with Egypt and Cuba, issues that Araujo will deal with once in office.\n\nThe Arab nation cancelled a trip of Brazilian lawmakers this year after the president-elect promised to move the Brazilian Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Bolsonaro later said the decision was not taken.\n\nCuba announced earlier Wednesday that it was ending a program that sent almost 9,000 medics to Brazil, acting after Bolsonaro said the program could continue only under new conditions. Among other things, he said the doctors must receive their salaries directly from Brazil and not through the Cuban government and be allowed to bring their families with them during their assignments.\n\nBolsonaro will also be starting his administration with some friction with China, which has invested billions of dollars in energy, infrastructure and oil projects in Brazil. During the campaign, he complained: \"The Chinese are not buying in Brazil.

The Judiciary Committee took up the question of whether a president should be impeached and the only witness today. Was mr. Starr who began with a lengthy statement on what his investigation. Had conclude are first we go to Washington and ABC's Jackie Judd. Oh and Kenneth Starr as witness for the prosecution calmly and methodically laid out his case against the president. The key point about the president's. Conduct is this. On at least six different occasions. From December 171997. Through August 171998. The president had to make a decision. He could choose truth. Or he could choose deception. On all six occasions. The president chose deception. The. First decision says Starr came when mr. Clinton called Lewinsky at her Watergate apartment in the middle of the night. To tell her she would be a witness in the Paula Jones case. The president could have told ms. Lewinsky that they must tell the truth. Under oath. The president could have explained. That they might face embarrassment. But bat as a citizen. And as the president he could not lying under oath. And he could not sit by while Monica did so. The president. Did not say anything like that. Instead that Starr Lewinsky claimed they discussed cover story devised longer ago. At that moment. The president's answer month relationship. With a subordinate employee. Was transformed. It was transformed into an unlawful effort. To thwart the judicial process. Star said the president soon made another critical decision. To make a series of allegedly false statement when deposed by jones' lawyers. He testified that he could not were called being alone with ms. Lewinsky that was untrue. He testified that he could not recall ever being in the Oval Office hallway with miss Lewinsky except perhaps when she was delivering pizza. That was untrue he testified that he could not rule called gifts exchanged between ms. Lewinsky and him that was untrue. He testified. After a 142. Pause. That he was not sure whether he'd ever talked to ms. Lewinsky about the possibility. That she might be asked to testify. In the lawsuit. That was untrue. By contrast Starr's account of mr. Clinton's lengthy testimony before the grand jury was brief and without any graphic detail. The president thus denied certain con top conduct with ms. Lewinsky. And devised a variety of tortured and false. Definitions. But Starr defended having asked mr. Clinton for sexual details of his affair with Lewinsky. And for including them in his referral to congress the details. Of the president's relationship with ms. Lewinsky. Became relevant. Indeed. They became critical. In determining rather. And the extent to which the president made false statements under road. And otherwise obstructed just justice. Democrats objected when star went beyond the Lewinsky case. I believe mr. Starr's remarks are now out of order but he actually exonerated by a resident in a number of areas. All he testified mr. Clinton was not involved in firing White House Travel Office employees. Or in the collection of FBI files by two White House aides. And star revealed that last year he drafted a referral to congress. About mr. Clinton's alleged involvement in a fraudulent loan given to Susan McDougal but then decided the evidence was not strong enough. And at the end of this testimony with his voice rising star made a final her sense of his own conduct. I Revere. The law. I'm proud of what we have accomplished. We were assigned the difficult job. We have done Ent to the best of our abilities. We've tried to be both fair. And power. Clearly the independent counsel had a huge challenge going into this hearing to reshape his public image and to restore credibility to as much maligned investigation.

The unorthodox move inspired a scene in the 1986 Clint Eastwood film \"Heartbreak Ridge,\" where the Hollywood star similarly used a bulldozer to advance on a Cuban position.\n\nWin McNamee/Getty Images\n\nAbizaid is unique among high-ranking military officials for his intimate knowledge of the Arab world. The grandson of Lebanese-Christian immigrants, Abizaid is fluent in Arabic and obtained a master\u2019s degree from Harvard University in Middle Eastern area studies.\n\nMany considered his passion for the Arab world to be an asset during the early years of the Iraq War, when Abizaid oversaw the effort as CENTCOM commander. Now, if confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Abizaid will be tested in the Arabian peninsula.\n\nQuestions linger over the possible involvement of Saudi officials in the killing of Khashoggi, including de facto ruler Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has emphasized that the United States will hold all of those involved accountable, and pressed Saudi Arabia to do the same.\n\nThe Trump administration recently announced it would stop midair refueling of Saudi military flights to Yemen, and the State Department announced 21 Saudi \u201csuspects\u201d would have their U.S. visas revoked, or be deemed ineligible for a U.S. visa.\n\nCongress has also triggered an executive branch investigation into whether Saudi Arabia should face Global Magnitsky Act sanctions for human rights violations.\n\nThe appointment of a four-star general like Abizaid underscores how much the Trump administration values its military relationship with Saudi Arabia. President Donald Trump went to Saudi Arabia on his first overseas trip, and touted a $110 billion arms deal with the kingdom.\n\nMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe $110 billion figure represents offers of intent or interest, according to Bruce Riedel, director of the Brookings Intelligence Project and a former CIA officer. He described the deal as a \u201cwish list\u201d of what the U.S. would like to sell Saudi Arabia in the next four to five years, but it is not guaranteed that all the deals will come to fruition. Saudi Arabia has purchased $14.5 billion in arms so far.\n\nThe arms sales have been a focal point of Trump\u2019s deliberations on whether, and how much, to punish Saudi Arabia for the killing of Khashoggi.\n\n\"I don't want to lose all of that investment being made into our country. I don't want to lose a million jobs, I don't want to lose $110 billion dollars in terms of investment,\" Trump told reporters in October.\n\nAnother question looming over Abizaid\u2019s nomination is whether Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, will maintain his close relationship with Saudi officials, and whether Kushner will hinder Abizaid\u2019s ability to conduct diplomacy.\n\nSaudi Royal Palace/Bandar Al-Jaloud/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe ambassador post has remained vacant for nearly two years of the Trump administration, but Kushner has a close relationship with the prince and has made multiple trips to Saudi Arabia.\n\nKushner clashed with former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson over a Saudi campaign to blockade Qatar, as the Gulf states accused Qatar of harboring terrorists.

The opening arguments had to be delayed because two of the anonymous jurors. Already had to be replaced with Johnson is at the courthouse in Brooklyn whit what happened with these jurors. Well Diane as you mentioned really dramatic start before those opening statements even began this is been a long process with jurors complaining worried about their security. Their safety and also the time that this trial's guilt going to take expected to last up to four months. I'm gonna get into that just second to wanna deal lay of the land here is you can see this street by paper of the courthouse. Pretty much empty media tripod and cameras as a lot of the journalists have rushed inside for those opening statements to get back underway again today the unprecedented security this street blocked off Pierson no cars are able to pass their front of the building. But as you mentioned those two jurors really came as a surprise for those who were in the courtroom one juror actually delivered a hand written note to the judge expressing that she she had problems with anxiety. And medical issues had a note from a doctor in the judge fearing that this juror could actually break down crying. During the trial. Decided to go ahead and dismiss her a second juror who is self employed express financial concerns and said that he simply couldn't manage that the months long trial it would be too much or financial burden to. To him and is spam whites so those jurors were dismissed. And replace the opening statements yesterday morning got under way. Guzman is facing seventeen counts including drug trafficking murder. Kidnapping he's accused of a more than almost three dozen murders and a variety of different crimes the prosecution pinning him to be this this. This drug kingpin who for decades she. Murdered and slaughtered those were his competitors anything that got in his way. Described event as being important reedy and and and was able to come up with billions of dollars through this through through his elaborate to drugs deals over the years. Had a diamond encrusted pistol gold plated AK forty sevens so there is this this myth of el chapo Guzman that was created and that is something that the defense is actually trying to fight against saying that this is all basically. A hit job from the governments of US and Mexico winds actually putting the blame on his deputy that he was the real man in charge who's running things. While I Guzman was actually on the run and escaping from two prisons. And I will be interesting to see if that defense works the prosecution is trying to argue they shouldn't even be able to say that. So they're already off to quite the dramatic start on several levels with. But I in terms of safety and security and they're just seem to be so many concerns surrounding that in this trial not only. Those I'll chop O have a history of breaking out of maximum security prisons. But I know you know in terms of the jury people might be wondering why it been so difficult to retain the jurors but their own security is one of the big concerns as well. Well you can imagine what they are keeping the jurors' names anonymous and all of this and planned. Keep it that way after the trial is overby you can imagine what this man Guzman is accused of years and years that prosecution is is. Pinning its almost three dozen homicides on him that he was connected to they say. So there is their fear is a real issue with the jury answered those jurors are being escorted to and from the courthouse by US marshals every single day there's extra security also for any of the witnesses who may be called in this facility is actually. Receiving its its. Unprecedented level security it's the most security on a daily basis at this courthouse. In the history. Of the buildings even imagine what's going on here everything cut off there's also all. A lot that we don't know about el chapo Guzman and actually where he's been housed as the trial is taking place we know that he was in maximum security facility in Manhattan. In solitary confinement for a period of time but what is happening now and where exactly he is during the trial because they don't want to shut down the Brooklyn Bridge every single time he's passing back and forth. So there's a lot of unknowns about. How this is all playing out right now but security a top priority in you can imagine why. As this trial plays out Diane rightfully so with Johnson from the courthouse in Brooklyn where we appreciate it.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Police in Midlothian, Illinois said the officer involved in the fatal shooting of armed security guard Jemel Roberson is a white man and described Roberson's tragic death as \"the equivalent of a 'blue-on-blue,' a friendly-fire incident.\"\n\nThe officer who shot Roberson has been with the Midlothian Police Department for nearly four years and had three years of prior service with another agency, Chief Dan Delaney said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nRoberson is a black man.\n\n\"The Midlothian Police Department is completely saddened by this tragic incident and we give our heartfelt condolences to Jemel, his mother, his entire family and his friends,\" Delaney said in the statement. \"There are no words that can be expressed as to the sorrow his family is dealing with.\"\n\nThe officer, who is assigned to the patrol division and a team leader on the regional SWAT team, is currently on paid administrative leave, per standard policy, Delaney said, pending the outcome of an investigation by the the Illinois State Police Public Integrity Task Force.\n\nHe has not yet been publicly identified.\n\nA little after 4 a.m. Sunday, police in Robbins called for assistance from additional area police departments as it responded to a call about a shooting at Manny's Blue Room Bar, according to Midlothian police.\n\nMidlothian police said two of its officers went to the bar to help Robbins police.

He takes office Jan. 1.\n\nCuba made the announcement after Bolsonaro said the program overseen by the World Health Organization could only continue if doctors directly received their salaries from Brazil, and were able to bring their families with them during their assignments, among other conditions.\n\nThe Cuban government generally keeps most of the salaries of state employees working abroad as part of the socialist state's \"international missions.\" Participants also are generally barred from bringing family members in a measure that critics say is designed to prevent doctors from emigrating.\n\n\"Mas Medicos\" started five years ago under leftist President Dilma Rousseff. Cuba said roughly 20,000 doctors saw millions of patients in areas such as the Amazon rainforest and slums of major cities.\n\nCuba maintains similar missions in 67 other countries but \"Mas Medicos\" was one of the largest and most important, serving as a link between the cash-strapped island and South America's largest economy.\n\n\"Cubans have provided a valuable service to the Brazilian people with dignity, deep sensitivity, professionality, dedication and altruism,\" Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel wrote on Twitter. \"Such humane acts should be respected and defended.\"\n\nAll Cuban doctors work for the state and virtually all receive salaries that are well below $100 a month. Doctors are not permitted to leave Cuba without government permission, a control that was lifted for virtually all other Cubans five years ago.\n\nThousands of Cuban doctors work in the island's public health-care system, which suffers from crumbling infrastructure but still provides free and universal health care to all citizens. Thousands of other Cuban doctors go abroad each year and generate billions of dollars for the state, one of Cuba's most important sources of foreign exchange.\n\nThe doctors generally receive a fraction of the salary paid to the Cuban government. But even that fraction far exceeds the salaries of doctors working in Cuba. That drives many doctors to complete foreign missions in order to earn cash for important expenses like home repairs, appliances or a motor vehicle.\n\nThe Brazilian Ministry of Health said there were 8,332 Cuban doctors in Brazil, each costing the country roughly $3,100 a month, plus room and board.\n\nBolsonaro said Brazil would offer asylum to Cuban doctors who wished to stay in Brazil.\n\n\"This is slave labor,\" he said. \"I couldn't be an accomplice of that.\"\n\nNeither side said exactly when the Cuban doctors would be leaving but their departure comes at a bad time for Cuba, which is facing its third year of slow growth, expected to be around 1 percent this year. Productivity is low in virtually every state-run industry, tourism has slowed under the Trump administration and Venezuela, a key ally, has cut back on subsidized oil and other aid.\n\nNonetheless, Bolsonaro's conditions were out of the question for Cuba.\n\n\"It's not acceptable to question the dignity, professionalism and altruism of Cubans who, with the support of their families, provide services in 67 countries,\" the Cuban health ministry said in a statement. \"The Brazilian people will understand who bears the responsibility for the fact that our doctors can't keep providing their support and solidarity in that nation.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDe Sousa reported from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Leaders of Djibouti and Eritrea, which also had a turbulent relationship after multiple border clashes, met with the help of Ethiopia, though there has been no breakthrough.\n\nAhmed's office said after the vote that the lifting of sanctions will have far-reaching effects in improving stability and building lasting peace and normal relations in the Horn of Africa region.\n\n\"It will further enhance the collaborative gains that have been achieved in the region over the past few months,\" the Ethiopian prime minister's office said.\n\nEritrea, a former Italian colony, gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a 30-year guerrilla war. It had a decades-long border dispute with Ethiopia, including a war from 1998-2000 in which about 80,000 people died.\n\nThe Security Council imposed an arms embargo and other tough sanctions on Eritrea in 2009 for supplying weapons to Somalia's Islamic extremist al-Shabab rebels, who are opposed to the Somali government, and for refusing to resolve a border dispute with Djibouti, a key U.S. ally in the Horn of Africa.\n\nEritrea's Charge d'Affaires Amanuel Giorgio called the sanctions \"unwarranted punitive measures\" and told the council after the vote that \"the long overdue call for justice is finally answered.\"\n\nHe congratulated the people of Eritrea \"on this historic day,\" and stressed that \"Eritreans are extremely joyous and full of pride to have witnessed the recent positive regional developments ... (that) mark the beginning of a new dawn.\"\n\n\"While proud of the region's capability to resolve intransigent conflicts at unprecedented speed, we are not complacent,\" Giorgio said. \"Eritrea recognizes that a more difficult and complex task is waiting ahead. It is determined to redouble its own efforts and work closely with its neighbors to build a region at peace with itself.\"\n\nThe resolution immediately lifts \"the arms embargoes, travel bans, asset freezes and targeted sanctions imposed on Eritrea by the Security Council.\"\n\nBut the Netherlands' ambassador, Karel van Oosterom, stressed that other demands by the council including that Eritrea \"shall cease using illicit means to collect taxes outside of Eritrea\" remain valid. The Netherlands has said extortion and threats of force against its large Eritrean diaspora is a sensitive issue that is high on the country's political agenda.\n\nThe resolution urges Eritrea and Djibouti \"to continue efforts to settle their border dispute peacefully ... by conciliation, arbitration or judicial settlement, or by any other means of pacific dispute settlement\" in the U.N. Charter. And it urges the two countries to engage on the issue of combatants from Djibouti missing in action.\n\nThe Security Council said, \"it will continue to follow developments towards the normalization of relations between Eritrea and Djibouti.\"\n\nDjibouti's U.N. Ambassador Siad Doualeh welcomed the lifting of sanctions against Eritrea, but said third-party mediation \"failed to make significant progress toward a settlement\" of the boundary dispute.\n\nHe reiterated Djibouti's call for a final settlement by an impartial third party, such as an international arbitration tribunal or the International Court of Justice, of land and maritime boundaries and sovereignty over Doumeira Island.\n\n\"But continued stalemate is not an option! We need to expedite the process!\" Doualeh said.\n\nAs for Somalia, the resolution condemns continuing attacks by al-Shabab in the country and beyond and expresses concern at the presence of affiliates of the Islamic State extremist group \"and the security implications of the situation in Yemen for Somalia.\"\n\nIt commends efforts by Somalia's federal government to restore key economic and financial institutions and implement anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism measures. But it expresses concern at continued reports of corruption and diversion of public resources, including reports of \"alleged financial impropriety\" involving members of the government, parliament and opposition.\n\nThe resolution extends both the arms embargo on Somalia and the ban on the import and export of Somali charcoal until Nov. 15, 2019, as the council expressed concern that the charcoal trade is providing \"significant funding for al-Shabab.\"\n\nIt condemns al-Shabab's \"increased revenue from natural resources including the taxing of the illicit sugar trade, agricultural production and livestock\" and its involvement in the illicit charcoal trade.\n\nSomalia's U.N. Ambassador Abukar Dahir Osman said the government \"looks forward to the beginning of a new chapter of cooperation and partnership with all the countries in the Horn of Africa\" \u2014 and wants sanctions lifted.\n\nHe urged the Security Council to establish \"clearly defined benchmarks\" for ending sanctions.\n\nOsman said the government also calls for sanctions to target al-Shabab, which continues to receive weapons and resources from abroad.\n\nAnd he asked why the council hasn't taken action against construction of a naval base in Berbera in Somalia's breakaway northern region of Somaliland which he called \"a clear violation of the arms embargo.\" Somaliland has an agreement with the United Arab Emirates to build a base at the port of Berbera.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nElias Meseret contributed to this report from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia", "The widely honored Mexican novelist and poet Fernando del Paso has died at the age of 83.\n\nThe University of Guadalajara said Del Paso died Wednesday, but did not give a cause of death.

He argued that it's analogous to a 1916 deployment to counter the Mexican revolutionary Gen. Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on his way to visit U.S. troops along the border in south Texas, Mattis declined to provide an estimate of how much the mission will cost. He said cost figures he has received thus far are \"not anywhere near right.\" He added that he believes, \"very quickly we'll know the real cost. So we'll keep you posted as the real costs come in.\"\n\nIn his most extensive remarks about the hastily arranged border mission, Mattis argued that it fits an historical pattern dating to early in the 20th century. He noted that President Woodrow Wilson deployed tens of thousands of National Guard and active duty troops to the border in 1916 in response to a Mexican military raid into the U.S.\n\n\"That's over a century ago, and the threat then was Pancho Villa's troops \u2014 revolutionary raiding across the border into the United States,\" he said. He noted that more recently, National Guard troops were used in border missions ordered by President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, although not on the cusp of a midterm election.\n\nThe Pentagon chief said that within a week to 10 days the 5,800 troops currently deployed for the border mission will have accomplished all the tasks initially requested by Customs and Border Protection, although additional tasks are now being worked out between the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security. Mattis did not say how soon the mission might end; current deployments are scheduled to last until Dec. 15, but that could change.\n\nIn addition to the 5,800 active duty troops in the border area, about 2,100 National Guard troops have been providing border support since April.\n\nCritics have questioned the wisdom of using the military on the border where there is no discernible security threat, although President Donald Trump has said that a caravan of Central American migrants traveling northward through Mexico amounts to an \"invasion.\" Since the election, Trump has said little about the matter, and no border threat has yet materialized.\n\nAsked whether he believes there is a security threat at the border that justifies the use of the active duty military, Mattis said he defers to the judgment of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who joined him at the border Wednesday.\n\nNielsen and Mattis spoke with senior U.S. commanders and addressed rank-and-file troops. Mattis told the troops their mission is to \"back up\" Customs and Border Protection. \"Right now that's our role and that's all our role is,\" he said.\n\n\"The eyes of the world right now \u2014 certainly all of the Americans \u2014 are on you,\" Mattis told the soldiers, adding that they are part of a \"non-traditional\" mission. \"We're here because of the number of illegals who say they are going to illegally try to cross into our country,\" he said, apparently referring to the several thousand migrants moving north through Mexico.\n\nOne soldier asked Mattis what are the short- and long-term plans for the military mission.\n\nMattis said the short-term objective is to get sufficient numbers of wire and other barriers in place along the border as requested by Customs and Border Protection. The longer-term objective, he said, is \"somewhat to be determined.\"\n\n\"When you're in something like this,\" Mattis said, \"it's dynamic, it's unpredictable. We'll have to see.\"\n\nIn an interview with reporters traveling with him to Texas, Mattis took issue with assertions by critics that the deployment undertaken shortly before the Nov. 6 midterm elections was costing the military in preparedness for combat. He said military officers have told him that the deployment has been \"very good training\" because it amounts to a rehearsal for the kind of logistical demands \u2014 such as loading aircraft \u2014 that must be met in wartime.\n\n\"In terms of readiness, it's actually, I believe, so far improving our readiness for deployments,\" he said.\n\nMattis said the mission, which does not include performing law enforcement tasks, was reviewed by Department of Justice lawyers and deemed a legal undertaking. \"It's obviously a moral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen,\" he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP Radio correspondent Sagar Meghani contributed to this report.", "Transcript for Going cash-free is making more sense for consumers, businesses\n\nWhat's in your wallet while spur more people these days apparently it's not cash ABC's Karen Travers shows us the growing trend.

Seven more Palestinian militants were killed in Gaza, one Palestinian was killed in Ashkelon and dozens were injured on both sides of the border.\n\nAshraf Amra/APAImages/Polaris\n\nNetanyahu was forced to defend his decision to accept the cease-fire hours after Israeli residents from the town of Sderot protested, demanding harsher action against Hamas.\n\n\"I hear the voices of the residents of the south,\" Netanyahu said, speaking Wednesday at a memorial service for the nation\u2019s founding father, David Ben Gurion. \"Believe me, they are precious to me, their words penetrate my heart.\"\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended the State Memorial Ceremony for David Ben Gurion at Sde Boker.https://t.co/JCi678QL6A pic.twitter.com/GypbAT8YuS \u2014 PM of Israel (@IsraeliPM) November 14, 2018\n\n\"In normal times, a leader must be attentive to the hearts of the people, and our people are wise. But in times of crisis, when making critical decisions in the field of security, the public cannot always be a partner in the crucial considerations that must be concealed from the enemy,\" he said.\n\n\"Our enemies have pleaded for a cease-fire, and they know very well why,\" Netanyahu added, using the world \u201ccease-fire\u201d for the first time since Sunday. After a marathon 7-hour cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Israeli government officials didn\u2019t use the word, saying instead there would be calm unless action \u201cwas required.\u201d\n\nBut hours later, Netanyahu lost his hard right defense minister.\n\n\u201cI am here to announce my resignation as the Defense Minister for the State of Israel,\" Lieberman said at a press conference on Wednesday morning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that there were differences between Netanyahu and me,\" he said, calling the cease-fire a \"surrender to terror\" and denying he ever supported it.\n\n\u201cI could not continue in my position. I can\u2019t look in the eyes of residents in the south and families of the kidnapped soldiers.\"\n\nLieberman added that he also disagreed with the decision by Netanyahu's government to allow Qatari cash and fuel to enter Gaza last weekend, which was used to pay civil servant salaries and provide much-needed electricity. Over the weekend, some Gaza neighborhoods enjoyed 8 hours of electricity, a massive triumph for many people. Lieberman also called for early elections.\n\nLieberman will return to the Knesset as a member, but his party, Yisrael Beiteinu, is no longer part of Netanyahu's governing coalition, leaving the prime minister with a razor thin majority of just 61 votes.\n\nWhile Netanyahu's party, Likud, said he can handle taking on the responsibilities of defense minister as well, officials from Education Minister Naftali Bennett's party, Beit Hayehudi, have told Israeli press that unless he is given the defense minister, he will pull his party out of the coalition. Without Beit Hayehudi, Netanyahu's fourth government will collapse.\n\nSo while the cease-fire holds with Gaza, Netanyahu's government may not last the night.", "A former Chilean bishop was questioned by authorities Wednesday about allegations he covered up the sexual abuse of minors by a former air force chaplain.\n\nJuan Barros was interrogated for almost four hours by prosecutor Sergio Moya in Rancagua, 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of the capital.\n\nMoya said the retired bishop answered all questions, which centered on the case of former chaplain Pedro Quiroz.\n\nMoya said Barros was warned that he could be summoned to testify in other cases related to sexual abuse of minors by members of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nBarros told reporters that he hopes \"everything will be cleared up for the better.\"", "Transcript for First lady calls for firing of Deputy National Security Adviser Mira Ricardel\n\nAnd Alex it over to the White House for the present it is insinuating that some high level changes could be coming to the White House soon but it's actually.

The First Lady was irritated at some of the planning that Ricardo was involved in for her trip to Africa last month and felt that Ricard was not treating her staff with respect. So now this is very bold move from the First Lady count not you know a precedent setting we've certainly seen first ladies. Have significant influence over their husbands cabin and their staff policy but we seem to think of the first time we've seen a first lady's office. Preemptively put out a statement proactively.

They're right now they're both still in their positions of the big questions and is for how long and sources are saying the expectation is that the president will push Kirsten Nielsen out of that role as secretary of homeland security and he could be an interesting domino effect a 12 punch if Nielsen has pushed down chief of staff John Kelly could be the next to go he has been a forceful defender of Nielsen here at the White House and in fact sources say he's been trying to delay her departure. But Neal isn't has been the target of the president's anger and frustration. About the border he's not happy with the number of border crossings he's not happy that Nielsen is not pushing in enforcing stricter immigration policies whether or not she's just a scapegoat for the president on this. Her defenders will say who only so much she can do but they enjoy having been on the job a year she's at a very strained relationship with the president and certainly the expectation is.

If they engage in sexual misconduct or are involved in accidents of any sort, a company owner can be held legally liable.\n\nEmployment lawyers and human resources consultants say they're getting more questions than in the past from small business owners who want to know what they can do to protect themselves. The safest route is to not serve alcohol. But that's advice that's often ignored; owners don't want to come across as not trusting their employees, or to be treating them like they're irresponsible teenagers.\n\nIf owners are going to serve alcohol, there are steps they can take to lessen the likelihood of problems. Here are some of them:\n\n\u2014 Have a sit-down meal in a restaurant rather than a cocktail party; the structure of the event will make people less likely to misbehave. And the earlier you schedule the meal \u2014 a lunch as opposed to a dinner \u2014 the less they're likely to drink.\n\n\u2014 If you're having the party on your premises or in an event space, hire a professional bartender, someone who has a trained eye for signs that someone has had enough to drink and shouldn't be consuming any more alcohol.\n\n\u2014 Use tickets or coupons to limit the number of drinks anyone can order. Some owners assign ticket numbers to individual staffers who then must show an ID to a bartender along with a ticket. That stops people from asking co-workers for tickets they're not going to use.\n\n\u2014 Don't have an open bar. Beer and wine have lower alcohol content and take longer to consumer.\n\n\u2014 Don't make drinking the centerpiece of the party. An activity like bowling, board games, painting, and even newer trends like hatchet-throwing will take people's minds off alcohol.\n\n\u2014 Be prepared to get taxis and car services for anyone who's had too much to drink.\n\n\u2014 If staffers are going to hold their own after-party, no one in management, including the boss, should be there. Employment law attorneys warn that if even one supervisory person is in attendance, the company could be held liable if there are accidents or injuries from staffers drinking too much.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor more small business news, insights and inspiration, sign up for our free weekly newsletter here: http://discover.ap.org/ssb\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg.

Pizano admits he can't be certain the suspicious payments were bribes, suggesting they may have even been outlays to paramilitary groups, and the conversation ends with Martinez telling Pizano not to discuss the matter with others.\n\nThe news program said Pizano, who had cancer, gave it the recording on the condition it not be aired until his death, which came last week. Authorities initially said he died of a heart attack, but that is now under review after his son died less than 72 hours later from exposure to cyanide contained in a bottle of flavored water found on his father's desk.\n\nThe Pizano recording dates from June 2015, just as the scandal over bribery payments was starting to engulf Odebrecht \u2014 revelations that that would lead to criminal charges against scores of senior politicians and business executives across Latin America. In a 2016 plea agreement with the U.S. Justice Department, Odebrecht admitted to paying $788 million in bribes to win contracts in 12 nations \u2014 including $11.1 million in Colombia.\n\nMartinez later became attorney general in 2016 despite complaints about his corporate background and years of service to the Aval Group, a New York Stock Exchange-listed banking conglomerate run by Colombia's richest man that was allied with Odebrecht.\n\nHe formally recused himself when his office opened an investigation into the Aval Group-Odebrecht contracts in 2017, charged a deputy minister and former senator with taking bribes and issued arrest orders against several middlemen as well as the former head of the Aval unit involved in the consortium.\n\nMartinez has since accused Odebrecht of shelling out almost $50 million in bribes in Colombia \u2014 or more than three times the amount the company acknowledged to U.S. authorities. Pizano was himself under investigation for an unrelated Odebrecht project.\n\nNow the recording has revived calls for Martinez to quit.\n\nThe union representing thousands of judicial workers called on Tuesday for Martinez's resignation, saying his apparent failure to denounce corruption he learned about in his law practice undermines his credibility as the standard bearer of Colombians' fights for justice.\n\n\"Whoever doesn't comprehend that sacred mission, or performs it with disregard, should step aside,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nMartinez through a spokesman declined a request for comment.\n\nThe 64-year-old, who also served in three previous Cabinet posts, was appointed to an autonomous, four-year term as Colombia's top law enforcement official in 2016 and he's been praised by U.S. officials who rely heavily on his agency's cooperation in hundreds of drug investigations every year aimed at breaking the Colombian cartels who are the world's top suppliers of cocaine.\n\nMartinez's cooperation has extended to ordering the controversial arrest on a U.S. drug warrant of a former guerrilla ideologue who negotiated the recent peace accord between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Kevin Whitaker in September called Colombia's handling of the Odebrecht case \"the best in the world, by far\" and attributed its success to the dedication of Martinez's office.\n\nBut his reputation took a hit when his top anticorruption prosecutor was arrested last year on a U.S. warrant for extorting bribes from politicians in exchange for soft-pedaling investigations against them.\n\nAnd he has been fending off allegations that he is abusing his authority to protect his long-time employer by Luis Andrade, the former head of Colombia's infrastructure agency.\n\nFor the past year, Andrade has been under house arrest on what he calls bogus charges that he favored Odebrecht's co-conspirators, though he has not been accused of taking bribes himself.\n\nHe has called the charges payback by Martinez for his attempt at the outbreak of the scandal to invalidate the Aval-Odebrecht highway contract.\n\nAn American citizen who previously helped run McKinsey & Company's consulting business in Latin America, he has enrolled a team of PR specialists and convinced a former U.S. senator to try to get the case dismissed.\n\nBut that effort has been complicated by the death of Pizano, who was supposed to be his key witness and is believed to have prepared detailed reports on corruption.\n\n\"Jorge Pizano was a courageous man who dared to render testimony against Odebrecht and Aval,\" Andrade said. \"Unfortunately, it cost him his life.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Goodman on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APjoshgoodman", "British Prime Minister Theresa May said late Wednesday her cabinet has agreed to a draft withdrawal agreement about the terms of the United Kingdom'sexit from the European Union.\n\nInterested in Brexit?

Some studies have suggested they had high injury rates, which have been blamed on things like social violence, attacks by carnivores, a hunting style that required getting close to large prey, and the hazards of extensive travel in environments full of snow and ice.\n\nWhile it's true that their lives were probably riskier than those of people in today's industrial societies, the vastly different living conditions of those two groups mean comparing them isn't really appropriate, said Katerina Harvati of the University of Tuebingen in Germany.\n\nA better question is whether Neanderthals faced more danger than our species did when we shared similar environments and comparable lifestyles of mobile hunter-gatherers, she and study co-authors say in a paper released Wednesday by the journal Nature.\n\nTo study that, they focused on skull injuries. They reviewed prior studies of fossils from western Eurasia that ranged from about 80,000 to 20,000 years old. In all they assessed data on 295 skull samples from 114 individual Neanderthals, and 541 skull samples from 90 individuals of our own species, Homo sapiens.\n\nInjury rates turned out to be about the same in both species.\n\nThat questions the idea that the behavior of Neanderthals created particularly high levels of danger, Marta Mirazon Lahr of Cambridge University wrote in an accompanying commentary.\n\nBut the new study is not the final word on Neanderthal trauma, she wrote. It didn't include injuries other than to the skull. And scientists still have plenty of work to do in seeking the likely cause of injuries and evidence of care for the injured, which could give insights into the behavior of both Neanderthals and ancient members of our species, she wrote.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Malcolm Ritter at @MalcolmRitter\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

The city's massive amounts of paving had an even bigger impact by reducing drainage. Land development in the metro area, on average, increased the chances of extreme flooding by 21 times, study authors said.\n\nA second study looked at last year's major Hurricanes Maria and Irma and 2005's deadly Katrina and used computer simulations to see what would have happened if there had been no human-caused global warming. The study found that climate change significantly increased rainfall from those three storms, but did not boost their wind speed.\n\nBoth studies are in Wednesday's journal Nature .\n\nHouston was a literal drag on Harvey as it sloshed through, with the storm getting tripped up by the skyscrapers, said study co-author Gabriele Villarini, a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of Iowa.\n\nCo-author Gabe Vecchi, a climate scientist at Princeton University, said that forced the storm to move up higher, causing more concentrated rain over Houston and slowing, which also made more rain.\n\nHe compared it to a river running over rocks, creating bubbles.\n\n\"That's sort of what's going on here,\" he said.\n\nThis effect is dwarfed, though, by the paving and building that don't allow water to sink into the ground, Vecchi said.\n\nHarvey's record rainfall reached 5 feet in one spot near Houston. The scientists used computer simulations to see the effects of urbanization. In parts of the Houston metro area, the effects of development ranged from a 10 percent higher risk of extreme flooding in the less developed northwest to nearly 92 times the risk in the northeast, they reported.\n\nThat's on top of the unique weather patterns that made Harvey slow down and stall and climate change which brought more water into the storm, Vecchi said.\n\nMIT hurricane and climate expert Kerry Emanuel, who wasn't part of the study, called the Harvey study \"a real advance in our understanding of hurricane impacts on urban areas.\"\n\nBut Texas state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon wasn't convinced. He said the team used generic shapes instead of the actual Houston skyline. He said the storm's wind speeds may have slowed, but that's different from the storm's forward movement slowing.\n\nThe other study in Nature looked at a variety of historical damaging storms and tried to calculate past and future effects of climate change. In three cases, the scientists simulated the storms without the changes in the climate from greenhouse gases, showing that global warming increased rainfall 8.9 percent in Hurricane Maria , 6.3 percent in Hurricane Irma and 8.7 percent in Hurricane Katrina .\n\nMaria hit Puerto and Rico and other parts of the Caribbean. Irma hit the Caribbean and Florida, while Katrina struck New Orleans and the Gulf Coast.\n\nIn Maria's case, a warming climate concentrated heavier rain in the center of the storm and reduced it on the edges, said co-author Michael Wehner, a climate scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\nFor 15 storms, which included the devastating Typhoon Haiyan , the potent Gilbert and 1992's Hurricane Andrew , the scientists projected future warming and found future versions of the same storms would be significantly wetter and stronger.\n\n\"We are beginning to see a climate change influence emerge on tropical cyclones and that's coming out as rainfall,\" said study lead author Christina Patricola, an atmospheric scientist at the national lab.\n\nAlthough replicating a storm in a different climate is difficult and can't account for certain changes, this work bolsters science understanding of how climate change alters hurricanes, Emanuel said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

There were instructions posted on that door to use another entrance instead. Perhaps because she was panicking, she did not see or could not understand those instructions, or she just didn't make it in time. She sat down on a bench, called 911 and told the operator she was outside the hospital emergency room, couldn't get in and was dying.\n\nAt one point, a nurse looked for her outside for 12 seconds but apparently didn't see her in the predawn gloom.\n\nShe was eventually found unresponsive by a firefighter on the bench 29 feet from main entrance. She died at another hospital days later.\n\nDeMarco said that although he accepted Wardell's apology, he was not satisfied with all the hospital officials' answers.\n\n\"The mistakes that led to Laura's death were so unnecessary. For the hospital to own up to them couldn't have been more necessary,\" DeMarco said in an email to The Associated Press.\n\n\"I was certainly disappointed with some answers, and disappointed to learn that Somerville Hospital's leaders have never spoken with the emergency room nurse who left Laura to die on a bench steps from the hospital's doors,\" he said.\n\nDeMarco said he was also pleased with Wardell's pledge to share the story of his wife's death with other hospitals to help them learn from Somerville Hospital's mistakes.\n\nDeMarco has no plans to sue the hospital, which he said now keeps both emergency room doors unlocked.\n\nHospital officials learned from their investigation into Levis' case and made several changes, including improving lighting, signage, video surveillance, and training for employees, Sayah said.\n\nWardell shook DeMarco's hand at the end of Tuesday's meeting. Sayah and chief nursing officer Lynette Alberti both hugged DeMarco.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Levis was found unresponsive on the bench and not dead, and died days later.", "German automaker Volkswagen will convert three factories in Germany to manufacture electric cars, ramping up production of zero-local emission cars ahead of tougher European emissions standards, the company said Wednesday.\n\nWolfsburg-based Volkswagen said Wednesday that it would begin local production of electric-powered vehicles at its facilities in Emden and Hannover in 2022. A plant in Zwickau was designated previously for e-car production.\n\nVolkswagen personnel head Gunnar Kilian said that workers were given a jobs guarantee through 2028, but that the company would work to reduce positions \"in a socially responsible way\" since electrics require fewer production steps.\n\nAnalysts say carmakers will need to add electric cars to their sales lineups to meet the new European Union rules on greenhouse gas emissions from 2021. Volkswagen and other car makers had bet heavily on diesel models, which get better mileage than gasoline powered vehicles, to meet tough limits on emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas scientists say causes global warming. Diesel sales in Europe have eroded, however, since Volkswagen was caught using software to cheat on diesel emissions tests and paid more than 28 billion euros ($31 billion) in fines, settlements and penalties. Subsequent scrutiny of diesel technology showed that other carmakers' vehicle emitted more nitrogen oxide pollution in real-life driving than during tests. The EU introduced new test procedures Sept. 1 that are intended to measure emissions in daily driving conditions.\n\nAs diesel sales fall carmakers are turning to electric vehicles to meeting the new C02 limits, even though consumer uptake has been slow because of higher costs and lack of convenient places to charge up. Battery electric cars were 0.6 percent of EU auto sales last year.\n\nDetails of the plant allocations will be decided by the Volkswagen board of directors at a meeting on Friday.", "Federal authorities have subpoenaed the social media company Snap Inc in an inquiry that appears to focus on Snap\u2019s March, 2017 initial public offering, the company confirmed to ABC News Wednesday.\n\nBoth the Justice Department (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) have subpoenaed the company, which own the popular messaging app Snapchat.\n\nThe revelation about the subpoenas comes in the wake of a 2017 shareholder lawsuit alleging that Snap underplayed how competition from Instagram weighed on the growth of Snapchat.\n\n\u201cSnap has been responding to subpoenas and requests for information made by staff from the DOJ and the SEC,\u201d a spokesman said in a statement. \u201cIt is our understanding that these regulators are investigating issues related to the previously disclosed allegations asserted in the class action about our IPO disclosures,\u201d the spokesman said, referring to the company's initial public offering.\n\nNews of the subpoenas was first reported by Reuters.\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nIn May of last year shareholders sued Snap, alleging the company made \u201cmaterial misrepresentations and omissions concerning Snap\u2019s user growth\u201d and issued \u201cmaterially false and/or misleading statements in Snap\u2019s registration statement for its IPO.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we do not have complete visibility into these investigations, our understanding is that the DOJ is likely focused on IPO disclosures relating to competition from Instagram,\" the Snap spokesman said in the statement.\n\n\"We continue to believe the class action's claims are meritless and our IPO disclosures were accurate and complete,\u201d the Snap spokesman said.\n\nThe company pledged to cooperate with the requests for information, which were first reported by Reuters.\n\nAfter Snap\u2019s $3.4 billion IPO its signature messaging app has disappointed investors and the stock price has dropped from its initial offering price of $17 per share to $6.71 on Tuesday.", "Transcript for In a first for Iran, hundreds of women attend a major soccer match in Tehran\n\n--\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "PG&E's stock lost more than 20 percent of its value Wednesday after the utility said it does not have nearly enough insurance coverage if it is found liable for a Northern California wildfire that has left at least 48 people dead and destroyed about 7,700 homes.\n\nSan Francisco based Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. told Wall Street regulators that if its equipment were found to have caused the fire that has ravaged the town of Paradise, California, it \"could be subject to significant liability in excess of insurance coverage.\"\n\nThat would deal a major blow to the utilities' finances and operations, it said.

Add Interest\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration is trying to fend off a legal challenge from CNN and other outlets over the revocation of journalist Jim Acosta's White House \"hard pass.\"\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly heard arguments Wednesday afternoon from lawyers representing CNN and the Justice Department. The news network is seeking an immediate restraining order that would force the White House to return Acosta's press credentials \u2014 which grant reporters as-needed access to the 18-acre complex.\n\nKelly said he would announce his decision Thursday afternoon.\n\nAcosta has repeatedly clashed with Trump and press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders in briefings over the last two years. But the dynamic devolved into a near-shouting match during a combative press conference last week following midterm elections in which Republicans lost control of the House of Representatives.\n\nAcosta refused to give up a microphone when the president said he didn't want to hear anything more from him. Trump called Acosta a \"rude, terrible person.\"\n\nThe White House quickly announced that Acosta's White House access would be revoked.\n\nThe CNN lawsuit calls the revocation \"an unabashed attempt to censor the press and exclude reporters from the White House who challenge and dispute the President's point of view.\"\n\nThe Associated Press joined with a group of 12 other news organizations, including Fox News, in filing an amicus brief Wednesday in support of CNN.\n\n\"Secret Service passes for working White House journalists should never be weaponized,\" said a statement by Fox News President Jay Wallace. \"While we don't condone the growing antagonistic tone by both the President and the press at recent media avails, we do support a free press, access and open exchanges for the American people.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Justice Department lawyer James Burnham argued that Acosta was guilty of \"inappropriate grandstanding\" and deserved to lose his access over \"his refusal to comply with the general standards of a press conference.\"\n\nBurnham also pointed out that CNN has dozens of other staffers with White House credentials, so excluding Acosta would not harm the network's coverage.\n\nThe network's lawyer, Theodore Boutrous, contended that Acosta was being singled out for his body of work, not his alleged rudeness during a press conference.\n\n\"The White House has made very clear that they don't like the content of the reporting by CNN and Jim Acosta,\" Boutrous said. \"Rudeness really is a code word for 'I don't like you being an aggressive reporter.'\"\n\nPrior to Wednesday's hearing, the White House had maintained that it has \"broad discretion\" to regulate press access to the White House.\n\nA pre-hearing legal filing argued, \"The President and his designees in the White House Press Office have exercised their discretion not to engage with him and, by extension, to no longer grant him on-demand access to the White House complex so that he can attempt to interact with the President or White House officials.\"\n\nTrump himself, in an interview published Wednesday, was uncertain how the court fight would end, saying: \"We'll see how the court rules. Is it freedom of the press when somebody comes in and starts screaming questions and won't sit down?\"\n\nTrump told The Daily Caller that \"guys like Acosta\" were \"bad for the country. ... He's just an average guy who's a grandstander who's got the guts to stand up and shout.\"\n\nThe White House's explanations for why it seized Acosta's credentials have shifted over the last week. Sanders initially explained the decision by accusing Acosta of making improper physical contact with the intern seeking to grab the microphone. But that rationale disappeared after witnesses backed Acosta's account that he was just trying to keep the mic, and Sanders distributed a doctored video that made it appear Acosta was more aggressive than he actually was.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sanders accused Acosta of being unprofessional by trying to dominate the questioning at the news conference.\n\nBoth Sanders and Trump are named as defendants in the CNN suit, along with Chief of Staff John Kelly and Randolph Alles, director of the Secret Service.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Khalil on Twitter at www.Twitter.com/Ashrafkhalil", "U.S. health officials say a record number of tick-borne diseases were reported last year.\n\nThe 2017 tally of more than 59,000 cases is a 22 percent increase from the previous year.

Pilots landed the crippled plane safely in Philadelphia.\n\nThe NTSB is expected to determine a probable cause for the accident in the next several months.\n\n2:15 p.m.\n\nAn official with the company that made the fan blade that broke causing an engine failure on a fatal Southwest flight says the broken blade had made about 32,000 flights.\n\nA spokeswoman for CFM International said Wednesday the company cannot comment on an open investigation, but added the company \"responded aggressively\" to complete blade inspections after the flight.\n\nAfter the fatal accident, CFM recommended the use of more sophisticated tests using ultrasound or electrical currents. The company also recommended much more frequent inspections and lubrication of the blades.\n\nMark Habedank with CFM International said an examination of the broken blade showed it was likely beginning to suffer cracks from metal fatigue when it was last inspected in 2012, but the cracks were smaller than the inspection test with fluorescent dye used at the time could detect.\n\n11:35 a.m.\n\nPassengers who pulled a woman back into a plane window on a Southwest fatal flight in April describe quick actions to try to help flight attendants.\n\nThe accounts were included in new documents released Wednesday before a national safety hearing into the plane's engine failure that left one passenger dead and eight others with minor injuries. The passengers describe seeing the woman still buckled by a lap belt with her head, torso and arm hanging out of the broken window.\n\nOne passenger, an EMT, and another male passenger sitting in the row ahead of the woman say they reached out of the window to pull the woman into the plane.\n\nThe EMT and another passenger, a former school nurse, began CPR until the plane landed and emergency personnel took over.\n\n12:05 a.m.\n\nFederal safety officials plan to question representatives from engine maker CFM International and Boeing about the fatal accident on a Southwest Airlines jet this year.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board hearing Wednesday in Washington, D.C., is expected to last several hours.\n\nThe board is still investigating the April 17 accident, in which an engine fan blade broke and debris hit the plane, killing a woman who was blown partly out a broken window. Pilots landed the crippled plane safely in Philadelphia.\n\nInvestigators are focusing on the design and inspection of engine fan blades. After the accident, CFM recommended more advanced and frequent blade inspections, and regulators made those changes mandatory.\n\nThey will also look into the design of the engine housing, which is supposed to prevent pieces from breaking loose.", "Two rival Lebanese Christian leaders reconciled Wednesday ending four decades of enmity triggered by a massacre of dozens during Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war.\n\nSamir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces group, and Sleiman Frangieh of the Marada Party shook hands and kissed each other on the cheeks at the headquarters of the Maronite Christian church north of Beirut.

I welcome you through prayers as happiness fills my heart and the heart of all Lebanese,\" al-Rai said in a speech after the two leaders met in front of journalists.\n\nThe two leaders are Maronite Christian and are both presidential hopefuls. Their reconciliation comes at a time when both their relations have become tense with foreign minister, Gibran Bassil, another presidential hopeful who heads the Free Patriotic Movement founded by President Michel Aoun. According to Lebanon's power-sharing system, Lebanon's president must be a Christian Maronite.\n\nFrangieh is a close friend of Syrian President Bashar Assad and is allied with the militant Hezbollah group while Geagea is with the Western and Saudi-backed coalition and is a harsh critic of both Assad and Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.\n\nIn 1978, members of the main Christian militia killed Frangieh's father, Tony, as well as his mother and sister and 30 Marada fighters and supporters.\n\nGeagea led the raid in the mountain resort of Ehden but was seriously wounded and withdrew from the operation.\n\nLast week, Frangieh met with the families of those killed four decades ago and asked if he can go ahead with the reconciliation and received their support.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, Geagea told reporters: \"Today is a beautiful day.

Raymond Beltran around 6 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nJail records show Cruz now is charged with aggravated assault on an officer, battery on an officer and use of an \"electric or chemical weapon against an officer.\"\n\nThe 20-year-old Cruz faces the death penalty in the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland that killed 17 people and wounded 17 others. He's pleaded not guilty in the shooting, but his lawyers say he would plead guilty in exchange for a life prison sentence.\n\nAccording to the assault arrest report, Cruz attacked Beltran after he was told to \"not drag his sandals around\" while walking in a jail dayroom. Cruz responded, the report says, by showing Beltran his middle finger and then rushing the deputy and striking him with his fist.\n\nThe report says Cruz and Beltran then \"got into a physical altercation\" in which both wound up on the floor and Cruz was able to wrest control of the stun gun, technically called a \"conducive electronic weapon.\" The stun gun discharged but it's not clear from the report whether it struck anyone; Beltran was able to regain control.\n\nBeltran was struck multiple times by Cruz using his fists, according to video surveillance cited by the report.\n\nFinally, the report says Beltran struck Cruz in the face with a fist containing the stun gun and Cruz then \"retreated to one of the seats\" in the dayroom before he was taken into custody.\n\nThe report doesn't detail the severity of injuries to Cruz or Beltran.\n\n\"We don't know any more than you do as of yet,\" Broward County Public Defender Howard Finkelstein said in an email.\n\nCruz appeared at a brief initial hearing Wednesday on the assault charges, with bail set at $200,000. But he won't be released because he is being held without bail on the murder charges.\n\nMeanwhile, the state commission investigating the shooting heavily criticized Wednesday the actions of the sheriff's deputy assigned to the campus, calling him a coward for not confronting the gunman.\n\nMembers of the Marjory Stoneman High School commission said Broward sheriff's deputy Scot Peterson was \"not a real cop\" and was \"a coward\" as they reviewed video and photos of his actions during the shooting. They said Peterson did not enter the building to confront the shooter, but stayed outside.\n\nHis attorney didn't respond to an email Wednesday seeking comment. Peterson is scheduled to testify before the commission Thursday. He has previously said he didn't know whether the shots were coming from inside or outside the building and that he heard only two or three shots.\n\nThe commission also heard from a Pinellas County detective who investigated Cruz's internet searches, text messages and cellphone usage.\n\nSgt. John Suess said Cruz's earliest found internet search referencing school massacres happened three months before the Parkland shooting. On Jan. 21, Cruz wrote himself a cellphone note saying \"life is a mess\" and \"unfair\" and he was getting \"even more agitated.\"\n\n\"I want to kill people but I don't know how to do it,\" he wrote.\n\nSuess said Cruz frequently looked up the song \"Pumped Up Kicks,\" where a shooter sings that other kids \"better run, outrun my gun.\"\n\nAbout a week before the shooting, he said, Cruz searched \"Is killing people easy.\"\n\nOn Feb. 9, five days before the shooting, Cruz did searches seeking information about homicidal thoughts and urges and for a therapist. Some commissioners said they believe Cruz was having second thoughts.\n\nBut the next day, Cruz was again looking at videos about the Columbine and Virginia Tech shootings.\n\nThree days before the shooting, Cruz made previously released cellphone videos that he never shared outlining his plans, the commission was told. He looked up how long it takes police to respond to school shootings.\n\nOn the morning of the shooting, Cruz sent innocuous texts to the friend he was living with about meeting some girls that night or that he might go to a movie.\n\nIt was Valentine's Day and during the two hours before the shooting, Cruz tried repeatedly to engage his ex-girlfriend in phone and text conversations, but she told him to leave her alone and that she had a boyfriend. He responded, \"You will always know I love you.\"\n\nHe soon contacted Uber to take him to the school.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Curt Anderson on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Miamicurt", "French authorities say they have closed an investigation into the disappearance and subsequent detention in China of the former president of Interpol, and found no evidence to support his wife's claim that she got a threatening call in Chinese after he was picked up.\n\nGrace Meng, the wife of Meng Hongwei, detailed the threatening call in an Associated Press interview in October. She said the caller told her to only listen but not to speak and threatened: \"We've come in two work teams, two work teams just for you.\"\n\nAn official close to the French investigation said Wednesday that police in the city of Lyon, where Interpol is headquartered, closed their probe into the call and Meng's detention having found no evidence that a crime was committed in France.

Police were responding to a gunfight early Sunday at Manny's Blue Room in Robbins that injured four people, including Myrickes.\n\nMyrickes, who was shot in the shoulder, told The Associated Press in a phone interview from his hospital room that he clearly heard several people shout at the officer that Roberson \u2014 who was holding a suspect at gunpoint \u2014 was a security guard.\n\nIt was not the only aspect where Myrickes' account differed from that of the news release that Illinois State Police issued Tuesday night that for the first time addressed in detail what happened in the predominantly black community of Robbins just south of Chicago. The agency declined to comment beyond the release, which came as questions have swirled about whether the shooting was justified and whether race played a role.\n\nIn its release, state police said Roberson was wearing \"plain black clothing with no markings readily identifying him as a Security Guard.\" However, Myrickes said all the security guards wore knit hats emblazoned with the word \"Security\" on them and that Roberson wore a black sweat shirt with the word \"Security\" on the back of shoulder. But he also acknowledged that it's possible the officer could not see the white lettering from where he was standing.\n\nMyrickes was one of six security guards working at the bar at the time, but he is the only one so far to come forward publicly to discuss what happened. A bar patron also told reporters earlier that he heard people yelling at the officer that Roberson was a security guard.\n\nMyrickes, 43, said the initial shooting at the bar stemmed from a fight between two groups of people. As security guards tried to separate them and lead them out separate doors, \"Somebody came back and opened fire,\" Myrickes said.\n\nHe said he wasn't armed and that he doesn't believe other security guards fired their weapons.\n\nThe officer who shot Roberson was from the nearby community of Midlothian and was among several officers from various agencies who responded to the shooting. Myrickes told the AP that the officer ran into the bar and pointed his gun at a bar customer, the bartender and Myrickes. Myrickes said he informed the officer that he was a security guard, and the officer then went outside.\n\nLooking out the door, Myrickes said he \"could see Jemel had one guy face down, asking him to put his hands behind his back\" when he saw the officer point his weapon at Roberson.\n\n\"I never heard the cop demand him to do anything, (but) everybody was telling him (Jemel) was security.\"\n\nMyrickes also noted that none of the other responding officers opened fire.\n\nThe officer's name has not been released. He is on paid leave.\n\nVideo of the shooting could reveal exactly what happened, but the agencies involved have not said whether any exists. If any police bodycam video exists, no state law requires that it be released. The Chicago Police Department releases video within 90 days of a shooting, but that policy does not apply because that agency's officers were not involved.\n\nKulis, who has filed a motion asking a judge to order the agencies to preserve any footage they have, also said he doesn't yet know how many times Roberson was shot or where on his body he was shot.\n\n\"I talked to the family after they viewed his body and they said they (authorities) did not tell them how many times he'd been shot,\" he said.", "Transcript for Russians caught crossing bridge disguised as bus\n\nTo Russia now and you don't we have these pedestrian bridge is there are meant for pedestrians but how do you get a rounded didn't.

Switzerland isn't a member of the 28-nation bloc.\n\nIn order to open a formal investigation into a lawmaker, prosecutors have to first ask for that person's immunity to be lifted.\n\nAlternative for Germany, which placed third in national elections last year, acknowledged this week that Weidel's local party chapter received the money from Switzerland, which was marked \"campaign donation Alice Weidel.\" The Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger reported that the payments were listed as coming from a company named PWS Pharmawholesale International AG.\n\nGerman media reported Wednesday that Weidel used part of the money to pay for social media advertising during her election campaign and for a lawyer suing journalists on her behalf.\n\nAlternative for Germany confirmed she used the funds to pay bills, but said she later ordered the donations returned after doubts were raised about their legality.\n\nLate Wednesday, Alternative for Germany released a statement saying it had informed parliament of a separate donation of 150,000 euros to Weidel's local chapter from a Belgian foundation called Stichting Identiteit Europa. The party said the donation was received Feb. 13 but was returned three months later because \"neither the identity nor the motivation of the donor could be determined without doubt.\"\n\nThe party said Weidel acted within the law with both donations.", "A week after President Donald Trump forced Jeff Sessions to step down from heading the Justice Department and appointed Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general, the DOJ has now authored a memo defending Whitaker's appointment as legal and constitutionally valid.\n\nInterested in Donald Trump? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nThe high-level appointment of Whitaker -- a frequent critic of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe who was not confirmed by the Senate before joining the Justice Department last year as chief of staff to Sessions -- has prompted both Democrats and even some Republicans to cry foul.\n\nBut in a 20-page memo Wednesday to White House counsel Emmet Flood, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel says, \"Mr. Whitaker's designation as Acting Attorney General accords with the plan terms of the Vacancies Reform Act,\" which states that when cabinet members and other senior government officials are \"unavailable\" to fulfill their duties, the president can appoint other government officials to temporarily serve in the positions if those replacements are sufficiently senior and have been employed by the government for at least 90 days.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Wednesday on the condition of anonymity, a senior Justice Department official said the Justice Department provided the legal analysis at the behest of the White House -- but the official refused to say when the White House asked if appointing Whitaker would be constitutional.\n\nFurther, the memo argues that Trump could have appointed Whitaker whether Sessions voluntarily resigned or was explicitly fired by Trump.\n\n\"Doesn't that mean that, in theory, the president under your interpretation could fire anyone he wants and ... just make anyone a Cabinet official?\" a reporter asked the Justice Department official.\n\n\"I don't want to address hypotheticals,\" the official responded, \"[but] it is correct that if the president terminates officials, that official is unavailable under the Vacancies Reform Act.\"\n\nA lawsuit filed by the state of Maryland on Tuesday is challenging the constitutionality of Whitaker's appointment, insisting the Constitution and U.S. law require that someone acting as attorney general and other \"principal\" positions be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nBut the Justice Department disputes that.\n\n\"Although an Attorney General is a principal officer requiring Senate confirmation, someone who temporarily performs his duties is not,\" the head of the Office of Legal Counsel, Assistant Attorney General Steve Engel, wrote in the memo released Wednesday. \"It is no doubt true that Presidents often choose acting principal officers from among Senate-confirmed officers. But the Constitution does not mandate that choice.\"\n\nEngel's memo says that previous administrations, including under Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, have similarly appointed non-Senate confirmed officials to positions that report directly to the president.\n\nHowever, asked whether someone not confirmed by the Senate has ever been appointed acting attorney general, the Justice Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said, \"The best examples we found were in 1866\" -- four years before the Justice Department was created.\n\nThe official would not say whether the Office of Legal Counsel has advised Whitaker over whether he should recuse himself from overseeing Mueller's investigation.", "Michael Buble, \"love\" (Reprise Records)\n\nWhen people claim they are stepping away from it all to spend more time with their family, it's usually a front. When Michael Buble said he'd do the same, it really was to take care of son Noah, who was diagnosed with cancer in 2016.\n\nWith his boy recovering, the Canadian crooner has returned to his career, including a new album and a big U.S. tour starting in February. \"love\" (represented by a red heart on the album cover) sounds like a new start for Buble, who has won four Grammys since his 2003 major-label debut by relying on a well-chosen mix of jazz standards and pop songs.\n\nLike that album, \"love\" has David Foster in the producer's chair and most of the tunes are evergreens, including \"When I Fall Love,\" ''Unforgettable,\" ''When You're Smiling\" and \"I Only Have Eyes for You.\" Buble sounds totally at ease with the repertoire and the arrangements harken back to the '50s and '60s, with the string section especially effective.\n\nKris Kristofferson's \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\" has a Mariachi mood and vocal accompaniment from Loren Allred, while Buble duets with Cecile McLorin Salvant on \"La Vie En Rose.\" The only song co-written by Buble is \"Forever Now,\" clearly a message of love to Noah.\n\nA pair of tunes come from the 1937 Rodgers & Hart musical \"Babes in Arms\" \u2014 an ominous-sounding \"My Funny Valentine\" fit for a spy movie and \"Where or When,\" the album closer where Buble seems to achieve a degree of catharsis, really ripping loose on the last notes.\n\nBuble stays within comfortable confines on \"love,\" but sometimes there's nothing wrong with being safe at home.", "Cameroon's military has killed at least 30 separatists in two days of intense fighting in the turbulent English-speaking North West region, a military spokesman said Wednesday.\n\nThe military freed people held by separatists during its two-day operation, military spokesman Col. Didier Badjeck said Wednesday. Fighting was intense in the Mayo Binka area near Nkambe, he said. While no soldiers have been killed, he said the death toll for armed separatists may increase, as fighters escape into the bush.\n\nIn a separate incident, the mayor of Nwa, a local council in the same region, was found dead Wednesday and he is believed to have been killed by separatists, said Emmanuel Bunyui, the mayor of the nearby town of Ndu. Many mayors in English-speaking regions have been targeted by armed separatists demanding an independent English-speaking state, which they call Ambazonia.\n\n\"When we hoist the Cameroon flag in the council premises, we are targeted by the armed men who insist that we should instead display their blue and white flag,\" Bunyui said.\n\nThese incidents have highlighted the separatist unrest in Cameroon, which began in 2016, when English-speaking teachers and lawyers in the northwest and southwest staged demonstrations calling for reforms, criticizing what they called the marginalization of the Anglophone population, which accounts for about one-fifth of the country's 25 million people.\n\nViolence increased after factions of separatists armed themselves following a government clampdown on protests in 2017. Armed separatists have vowed to destabilize the regions and hundreds of civilians have been killed and dozens of schools have been burned and teachers threatened.\n\nIn the past year, more than 1,200 people including separatists, police, military and gendarmes have been killed in the fighting, according to military spokesman Badjeck.\n\nRecently 79 students and three staff were kidnapped from a school by suspected separatists, and they have all now been released.\n\nMore than 100 civilians have escaped the violence and fled to the capital, Yaounde.\n\n\"I am just going to nowhere. I am afraid,\" said Kenneth Kongyu, 19, who joined 75 other people who walked 60 kilometers (37 miles) for two days to escape violence in Ndu, Bunyui's town. \"When they come to the market, they shoot from every angle.\"\n\nTatah Oscar, 17, said he is a former fighter. He said many young Cameroonians are joining the separatists because their families have been killed by military \"so they don't have somebody to count on again ... I am pleading on the government to try and solve the problem so that we the youths we can go back to school.\"\n\nCol. Badjeck, however, said \"Most of the time the terrorists operate and hide among civilians and the world has an impression that civilians are being killed, but our military is professional.\"\n\nIn November last year, Cameroonian President Paul Biya declared the crisis a war. Biya was re-elected to his seventh term in October, although few votes were cast in war-torn Anglophone regions.\n\nPoliticians have repeatedly called on Biya to initiate dialogue to stem the violence. The 85-year-old president, who has ruled Cameroon since 1982, has repeatedly stated that Cameroon is one and indivisible and that he is not ready to negotiate.\n\nThe conflict poses a serious challenge for Cameroon, a close U.S. security ally in combating extremism and a new member of the U.N. Human Rights Council. The United Nations have condemned both the Cameroon military and separatists for using unnecessary and excessive force and Amnesty International criticized the \"horrific escalation of violence\" in English-speaking regions.\n\nNearly a quarter-million more people have fled the ongoing violence, many leaving their homes on foot with their belongings teetering on their heads.", "Lawyers suing President Donald Trump over his decision to end special protections shielding certain immigrants from deportation are seeking unaired footage from his reality TV show \"The Apprentice\" to try to bolster their case alleging the move was racially motivated, the attorneys said Wednesday.\n\nLawyers for Civil Rights, which sued Trump in February , has issued subpoenas to MGM Holdings Inc. and Trump Productions LLC demanding any footage shot during the production of the show in which Trump \"uses racial and/or ethnic slurs\" or \"makes remarks concerning race, nationality and/or ethnic background.\"\n\nFormer White House staffer and fellow reality-TV star Omarosa Manigault Newman claimed without evidence in a book released in August, \"Unhinged,\" that a tape exists of the president using the N-word on the reality show's set.\n\nTrump has denied the existence of such tapes, tweeting that the show's producer told him \"there are NO TAPES of the Apprentice where I used such a terrible and disgusting word as attributed by Wacky and Deranged Omarosa.\"\n\n\"I don't have that word in my vocabulary, and never have,\" Trump said.\n\nThe case filed in Boston's federal court centers on the Trump administration's decision to end temporary protected status for thousands of immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador and Honduras. Temporary protected status provides safe havens for people from countries experiencing armed conflicts, natural disasters and other challenges.\n\nLawyers for Civil Rights says in the lawsuit that Trump's move to rescind the program was rooted in animus against immigrants of color, citing comments he made on the campaign trial and in office.\n\n\"Access to these videotapes will help further demonstrate that Defendant Trump holds racially biased views that impact his policy and decision making,\" attorney Oren Nimni said in a written statement. The subpoenas also seek any relevant outtakes, audio clips and transcripts made during production of the show.\n\nEmails seeking comment were sent to an MGM lawyer, a Trump Production official and White House officials.\n\nA federal judge in July denied Trump's request to throw out the lawsuit and rejected the administration's bid to remove Trump as a defendant in the case.\n\nIn a different case in California, another federal judge last month issued a temporary injunction that bars the Trump administration from ending the protections, saying there is evidence that president \"harbors an animus against non-white, non-European aliens which influenced his ... decision to end the TPS designation.\"\n\nThe Trump administration is appealing that ruling.\n\nPressure on producers of the \"The Apprentice\" to release unaired footage of the show intensified during the 2016 presidential campaign after The Washington Post published a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" recording of Trump boasting about aggressively groping women.\n\nMGM, which owns \"The Apprentice,\" said at the time that it couldn't unilaterally release any unaired, archived material because of contractual obligations. The show's producer, Mark Burnett, also said he didn't have the ability or right to release footage.\n\nA former contestant on \"The Apprentice\" who has accused Trump of unwanted groping and kissing has also sought footage through a lawsuit against the president, but it's unclear whether she has received any.\n\nThe subpoena issued by Summer Zervos' attorney in May sought any \"Apprentice\" material that features Zervos, or Trump talking about her or discussing other female contestants in a sexual or inappropriate way.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Alanna Durkin Richer on Twitter at http://twitter.com/aedurkinricher .", "The alcohol will flow less freely, and sometimes not at all, at some small business parties this holiday season.\n\nOwners concerned about sexual misconduct and the safety of staffers and guests are eliminating or limiting the open bar, making their events alcohol-free or switching from a traditional cocktail party to activities including games and contests. Human resources consultants and employment law attorneys say they're fielding more questions about alcohol and parties than in the past following the string of high-profile sexual misconduct cases that began a year ago. They're advising their small business clients to impose limits on how much people drink.\n\nLadan Davia decided there'd be no drinking at her company's party this year after two incidents at last year's gathering \u2014 a male staffer and then a female staffer who were drunk groped other co-workers.\n\n\"I'm creating a safer environment for everyone,\" says Davia, owner of Beeya, a job search website based in Irvine, California. \"While I know it can be seen as 'not fair' for banning alcohol from our holiday party, I would respond saying it's 'not fair' for anyone to feel uncomfortable especially in their place of work.\"\n\nDavia understands that alcohol becomes a form of entertainment at an office party, so she's going to have substitutes for her 11 staffers and their guests: a magician, games and prizes.\n\nHR consultant Rob Wilson has gotten many more calls than in the past from companies needing help with party policies. Even owners who haven't had problems are asking about going alcohol-free or limiting everyone's intake. Some owners ask whether they should have chaperones to ensure no one is overdrinking or trying to grope anyone.\n\n\"They're much more cautious than I've ever seen,\" says Wilson, president of Chicago-based Employco.\n\nOwners' questions come from their concerns about staffers' well-being and the fact they're legally liable if drunken employees or guests are in accidents of any kind, hurting themselves or others. The company is also liable if a staffer sexually harasses or verbally or physically abuses anyone.\n\nThere are ways to prevent problems, starting with banning or limiting alcohol. One way to put the brakes on drinking is to give staffers coupons or tickets for drinks. Another option is to serve only wine and beer.\n\nSome of Jay Starkman's small business clients struggle with the idea of not serving alcohol. They're concerned about sending a negative message to staffers.\n\n\"They're saying, 'I don't want to not trust my people, or insinuate that they're a problem,\" says Starkman, CEO of Engage PEO, an HR provider based in Hollywood, Florida. Using drink coupons is a way around that concern, Starkman says.\n\nJulia Kravets used to have an open bar at the parties at her Brooklyn, New York, restaurant, Little Choc Apothecary, but some employees drank so much they became sick and Kravets had to help them into cabs. Last year, Kravets brought in games \"as opposed to just standing there and alcohol is the only activity.\"\n\nShe did serve wine, but no one drank to the point of vomiting and \"I didn't have to revive anybody,\" Kravets says.\n\nWhen small business clients ask employment law attorney Mark Kluger what they should do, he tells them, no alcohol, period. But Kluger says that has been the most ignored advice given by the lawyers at his New Jersey-based firm, Kluger Healey, even though when alcohol is served, \"things can get out of hand and often do.\"\n\nThis year, clients' concerns about alcohol are ramped up because of the potential for sexual misconduct. Kluger suggests they follow his firm's example \u2014 it's not serving alcohol and is having its party at a hatchet-throwing venue. Kluger believes his staffers and guests won't miss drinking because they'll be having fun throwing hatchets at wooden targets, much like the events in lumberjack competitions.\n\n\"We need to walk the walk,\" Kluger says. \"Last year, we went bowling and we kept so busy, people weren't thinking, 'hey, we're not drinking.'\"\n\nJonathan Bell, also an employment lawyer, is serving alcohol at his firm's party at a restaurant. But, he says, \"we are sending an email before the holiday party about being responsible both for purposes of safety and for sexual harassment.\" He's also not allowing alcohol in the last hour of the celebration, and if his 11 staffers and/or their guests are drinking too much, he'll ask the restaurant to stop serving altogether.\n\nBell, founder of the Bell Law Group in Garden City, New York, is putting his staff on notice that they face discipline if they drink too much and behave badly. He notes that under the law, misconduct at a company-sponsored event is the equivalent of misconduct at work. He suggests all employers issue similar warnings \u2014 giving employees a reality check can help them stay in line.\n\n\"That seems to bring the focus to everyone that while they're hanging out and having a good time socially, they need to be responsible,\" he says.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor more small business news, insights and inspiration, sign up for our free weekly newsletter here: http://discover.ap.org/ssb\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

Doctors checked those fighting colds and other ailments while several dozen migrants, mostly single men, spent the night at a Tijuana beach that is cut by a towering border wall of metal bars. Several Border Patrol agents in San Diego watched them through the barrier separating the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nThe first wave of migrants in the caravan, which became a central theme of the recent U.S. election, began arriving in Tijuana in recent days, and their numbers have grown each day. The bulk of the main caravan appeared to be about 1,100 miles (1,800 kilometers) from the border, but has recently been moving hundreds of miles a day by hitching rides on trucks and buses.\n\nMany of the new arrivals were waiting in Tijuana for the caravan leaders to arrive and provide guidance on their immigration options to the U.S., including seeking asylum. Some said they might cross illegally.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, meanwhile, visited U.S. troops posted at the border in Texas and said the deployment provides good training for war, despite criticism that the effort is a waste of taxpayer money and a political stunt. Most of the troops are in Texas, more than 1,500 miles from where the caravan is arriving.\n\nThe first arrivals generally received a warm welcome from Tijuana, despite the fact that its shelter system to house migrants is at capacity. The city's secretary of economic development has said there are about 3,000 jobs for migrants who want to stay in the city. Some residents came down to where the men were camped on a beach and gave them tacos to eat Wednesday.\n\nThe Central Americans in the caravan are the latest migrants to arrive in Tijuana with the hope of crossing into the United States. Tijuana shelters in 2016 housed Haitians who came by the thousands after making their way from Brazil with plans to get to the U.S. Since then, several thousand Haitians have remained in Tijuana, finding work. Some have married local residents and enrolled in local universities.\n\n\"Mexico has been excellent; we have no complaint about Mexico. The United States remains to be seen,\" said Josue Vargas, a migrant from Honduras who finally pulled into Tijuana on Wednesday after more than a month on the road.\n\nIlse Marilu, 24, arrived in Tijuana late Tuesday with her 3-year-old daughter, having joined the caravan with a large contingent from San Pedro Sula, Honduras. She walked several miles Tuesday in a fruitless search for space in a migrant shelter before reaching the beach plaza. A Mexican couple dropped off a tent that her daughter and three other children used to sleep in as an evening chill set in.\n\nShe planned to stay in Tijuana until caravan leaders arrived and offered help on how to seek asylum in the US.\n\n\"We are going to enter through the front door,\" Marilu said, insisting she would never try to enter the country illegally.\n\nA few people pitched tents at the Tijuana beach plaza while most, like Henry Salinas, 30, of Honduras, planned to sleep there in the open.\n\nHe said that he intended to wait for thousands more in the caravan to arrive and that he hoped to jump the fence in a large group at the same time, overwhelming Border Patrol agents.\n\n\"It's going to be all against one, one against all. All of Central America against one, and one against Central America. ... All against Trump, and Trump against all,\" he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, a couple of dozen migrants scaled the steel border fence to celebrate their arrival, chanting \"Yes, we could!\" One man dropped over to the U.S. side briefly as border agents watched from a distance. He ran quickly back to the fence.\n\nTijuana's head of migrant services, Cesar Palencia Chavez, said authorities offered to take the migrants to shelters immediately, but they initially refused.\n\n\"They wanted to stay together in a single shelter,\" Palencia Chavez said, \"but at this time that's not possible\" because shelters are designed for smaller groups and generally offer separate facilities for men, women and families.\n\nBut he said that after their visit to the border, most were taken to shelters in groups of 30 or 40.\n\nOn Wednesday, buses and trucks carried some migrants into the state of Sinaloa along the Gulf of California and farther northward into the border state of Sonora.\n\nThe Rev. Miguel Angel Soto, director of the Casa de Migrante in the Sinaloa capital of Culiacan, said about 2,000 migrants had arrived in that area. He said the state government, the Roman Catholic Church and city officials in Escuinapa, Sinaloa, were helping the migrants.\n\nThe priest said the church had been able to get \"good people\" to provide buses for moving migrants northward. He said 24 buses had left Escuinapa on an eight-hour drive to Navojoa in Sonora state.\n\nSmall groups were also reported in the northern cities of Saltillo and Monterrey, in the region near Texas.\n\nAbout 1,300 migrants in a second caravan were resting at a stadium in Mexico City, where the first group stayed several days last week. By early Wednesday, an additional 1,100 migrants from a third and last caravan also arrived at the stadium.\n\nLike most of those in the third caravan, migrant Javier Pineda is from El Salvador, and hopes to reach the United States. Referring to the first group nearing the end of the journey, Pineda said, \"if they could do it, there is no reason why we can't.\"\n\nMexico has offered refuge, asylum and work visas to the migrants, and its government said Monday that 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them during the 45-day application process for more permanent status. Some 533 migrants had requested a voluntary return to their countries, the government reported.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Elliot Spagat reported in Tijuana, Mexico, and AP writer Maria Verza reported from Escuinapa, Mexico.", "Ugandan police say 10 students have been killed in an alleged arson attack targeting a school dormitory in central Uganda.\n\nPolice spokesman Emilian Kayima said Wednesday that a tenth victim succumbed to his wounds while being admitted at a local hospital.\n\nThe Ministry of Education said 40 other students \"escaped with injuries of varying degrees\" from the fire that swept through the dormitory early Monday.\n\nPolice say they are investigating the fire as a \"deliberate attack\" although the motive is still unclear.\n\nThe fire has renewed calls for schools to have safety equipment, including fire extinguishers.\n\nIn 2008 a similar fire at a school dormitory near the capital Kampala left at least 19 pupils dead.", "U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry has been lobbying in Prague for the U.S. civil nuclear industry as the most suitable to develop the Czech nuclear program.\n\nThe Czech Republic relies on nuclear energy and the current six reactors produce a third of the country's electricity.\n\nThe country is planning to build new reactors and possibly extend the life of some of the existing ones.\n\nPerry said Wednesday: \"I can assure you that the U.S. industry is the safest, most reliable for the job.\"\n\nAlthough the Czech government has yet to announce a detailed plan, six major industry players from around the globe, including U.S. Westinghouse and Russia's Rosatom are interested in getting a lucrative deal.\n\nPerry warned against cooperation with Russia, saying it has used energy \"as a political weapon.\"", "The makers of e-cigarettes are facing new government restrictions on how the popular liquid nicotine products can be advertised and sold, with a top federal regulator making clear that industry hasn't done enough to keep vaping devices away from young people.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration already bans the sales of e-cigarettes and tobacco products to those under 18.

Add Interest\n\nThe Justice Department on Wednesday released an internal legal opinion supporting the legality of Matthew Whitaker's appointment as acting attorney general as Democrats press the case that President Donald Trump violated the law and Constitution by making Whitaker the country's chief law enforcement officer.\n\nThe 20-page opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel, which provides advice to executive branch agencies, aims to rebut mounting complaints that Trump illegally sidestepped procedure by appointing Whitaker over Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nRosenstein, the second-ranking Justice Department official, has been confirmed by the Senate and had been overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Whitaker had been chief of staff to now-ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a job that didn't require Senate confirmation. He became acting attorney general when Sessions was forced out on Nov. 7 and was given oversight of Mueller's inquiry.\n\nSince then, the state of Maryland has challenged Whitaker's appointment, arguing that the top Justice Department job must be held by a Senate-confirmed official such as Rosenstein. A defense lawyer in Las Vegas is similarly arguing that a drug case involving his client should be halted if Whitaker was improperly appointed to lead the department.\n\nCongressional Democrats, meanwhile, have called the appointment unconstitutional and demanded that Whitaker recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller investigation. At least two former Republican attorneys general, Alberto Gonzales and Michael Mukasey, have also raised questions about it, and a handful of GOP senators are urging their leadership to hold a vote on legislation that would protect Mueller.\n\nIt was unclear whether the legal opinion would satisfy opponents of Whitaker's appointment, but the document does provide by far the most detailed defense from the Justice Department of a selection that has roiled Washington.\n\nThe opinion concludes that Whitaker, even without Senate confirmation, may serve in an acting capacity because he has been at the department for more than a year at a \"sufficiently senior pay level.\"\n\nThe opinion tries to reconcile two seemingly conflicting statutes by saying that even though the department's own line of succession specifies that the deputy attorney general may hold the top spot in the event of a vacancy, a more general law known as the Vacancies Reform Act empowers presidents to depart from that order and to promote officials who haven't been confirmed by the Senate.\n\nAlthough Whitaker is not Senate confirmed and was not the deputy, the opinion concludes that he nonetheless satisfies a third element of the law by having been with the Justice Department for at least 90 days and earning high enough pay for consideration.\n\n\"As all three branches of government have long recognized, the President may designate an acting official to perform the duties of a vacant principal office, including a Cabinet office, even when the acting official has not been confirmed by the Senate,\" the opinion said.\n\nThe opinion identified more than 160 times before 1860 in which non-Senate officials were temporarily appointed to fill vacancies as Cabinet secretaries or equivalent jobs, including some with no prior experience in federal government.\n\nIt said that both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama had designated unconfirmed agency officials as acting agency heads and that Whitaker was not the first unconfirmed official to run an agency on an interim basis in the Trump administration.\n\nEven so, the opinion could identify only one instance, in 1866, when a non-Senate confirmed assistant attorney general became acting attorney general. The Justice Department was not established as its own agency until 1870.\n\n\"Mr. Whitaker's designation is no more constitutionally problematic than countless similar presidential orders dating back over 200 years,\" the opinion says.\n\nStephen Vladeck, a University of Texas at Austin law professor, said that although the Justice Department's legal analysis appeared sound, the circumstances surrounding the Whitaker appointment may be \"radically different from what any of these historical examples were dealing with.\"\n\n\"The one point (on) which I can hope everyone can agree is, whatever your bottom line is, Congress should fix this,\" he added. \"Congress should limit the circumstances in which the president can bypass Senate-confirmed officers in the same agency.\"\n\nA Justice Department official said the White House contacted the Office of Legal Counsel for advice, before Sessions was replaced, about options in the event of a vacancy. The department made the official available to brief reporters only on the condition that the official not be identified by name. The official would not say when exactly the White House had requested the office's advice.\n\nThe opinion didn't address the question of whether Whitaker should step aside from overseeing Muller's investigation into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nMany Democrats have called on Whitaker to withdraw from that role, citing derogatory comments that Whitaker made about the inquiry before joining the department. The investigation until now had been overseen by Rosenstein.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOnline:\n\nLegal opinion: https://tinyurl.com/ycc8zzad", "Interested in Pittsburgh Synagogue Shooting?

Clark became \"really riled up\" after his younger brother, Edward, shot and killed himself within hours of the Pittsburgh attack, the relatives told agents.\n\nThe relatives believed 23-year-old Edward Clark may have been planning to carry out an \"act of violence\" that day before he went to Theodore Roosevelt Island in Washington and killed himself, an FBI agent wrote in an affidavit.\n\n\"According to (two relatives), Jeffrey and Edward Clark believed that there would be a race revolution, and they wanted to expedite it,\" the affidavit says.\n\nClark made his initial court appearance Tuesday on charges that he illegally possessed firearms and high-capacity magazines for rifle ammunition. A federal magistrate ordered Clark held without bond pending a detention hearing Friday.\n\nA federal public defender assigned to represent Clark didn't immediately respond to a call or email Wednesday.\n\nAfter a gunman killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue Oct. 27, Clark posted social media messages describing shooting suspect Robert Bowers as a \"hero\" and warning of a \"dry run for things to come,\" FBI Special Agent Michael Bauknight wrote in his affidavit.\n\nClark was one of Bowers' followers on Gab, a social media platform that became a haven for far-right extremists who have been banned by Twitter for racist and harassing messages. Bowers posted a slew of anti-Semitic messages on Gab before the shooting. Domain registrar GoDaddy dropped Gab after the shooting, knocking it offline for several days.\n\nJeffrey Clark became more outspoken about his \"radical views\" in his relatives' presence after his brother killed himself, the FBI affidavit says.\n\n\"During these conversations, Jeffrey Clark defended Robert Bowers' killings at the Tree-of-Life Synagogue. Jeffrey Clark also stated that he and Edward Clark had both fantasized about killing 'Jews and blacks,'\" the agent wrote.\n\nClark told FBI agents who arrested him last Friday that he was a member of white nationalist groups \"and followed their ideology,\" a court filing says. He also said he and his brother became interested in guns after the 2016 presidential election \"because they believed there was going to be a civil war,\" the filing adds.\n\nThe brothers attended the \"Unite the Right\" white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that erupted in violence in August 2017. Their relatives believe the brothers were photographed standing next to James Alex Fields, the man charged with plowing his car into a crowd of Charlottesville counterprotesters and killing one of them, Heather Heyer.\n\nJeffrey Clark's Gab username was \"DC Bowl Gang,\" an apparent reference to the haircut style of Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who shot and killed nine black people in 2015 at a church in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nClark's relatives told the FBI he abused drugs. On his Gab page, he described himself as, \"Meth-Smoking, Pipe Bomb making, mailman-murding,#Fed,#DemoKKKrat, Che Guevara of the altright.\" The \"alt-right\" is a fringe movement that's a loose mix of white nationalism, anti-Semitism and other far-right extremist views.\n\nClark told FBI agents he had contact with Bowers on Gab but became \"evasive\" when asked about those conversations, a court filing says.

Temporary protected status provides safe havens for people from countries experiencing armed conflicts, natural disasters and other challenges.\n\nLawyers for Civil Rights says in the lawsuit that Trump's move to rescind the program was rooted in animus against immigrants of color, citing comments he made on the campaign trial and in office.\n\n\"Access to these videotapes will help further demonstrate that Defendant Trump holds racially biased views that impact his policy and decision making,\" attorney Oren Nimni said. The subpoenas also seek any relevant outtakes, audio clips and transcripts made during production of the show.\n\nAn MGM lawyer and White House officials didn't immediately respond to an email requesting comment.\n\nA federal judge in July denied Trump's request to throw out the lawsuit and rejected the administration's bid to remove Trump as a defendant in the case.\n\nIn a different case in California, another federal judge last month issued a temporary injunction that bars the Trump administration from ending the protections, saying there is evidence that president \"harbors an animus against non-white, non-European aliens which influenced his ... decision to end the TPS designation\n\nThe Trump administration is appealing that ruling.\n\nPressure on producers of the \"The Apprentice\" to release unaired footage of the show intensified during the 2016 presidential campaign after The Washington Post published a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" recording of Trump boasting about aggressively groping women.\n\nMGM, which owns \"The Apprentice,\" said at the time that it couldn't unilaterally release any unaired, archived material because of contractual obligations.

But the bipartisan commission highlights the potential security risks to the United States by China's pre-eminence in the so-called internet of things, or IoT, which refers to the proliferation of physical devices that have sensors that collect and share data and connect to the internet. Such devices could be everything from household appliances like refrigerators and air conditioners to warehouse delivery systems, smart traffic signs and aerial drones.\n\n\"The scale of Chinese state support for the IoT, the close supply chain integration between the United States and China, and China's role as an economic and military competitor to the United States creates enormous economic, security, supply chain, and data privacy risks for the United States,\" the report says.\n\nThe commission, which does not set policy but can make recommendations to Congress and the U.S. administration, is warning that the potential impact of malicious cyberattacks through such systems will intensify with the adoption of ultra-fast 5G networks that could quicken data speeds by up to 100 times.\n\n\"The lax security protections and universal connectivity of IoT devices creates numerous points of vulnerability that hackers or malicious state actors can exploit to hold U.S. critical infrastructure, businesses, and individuals at risk,\" the report says.\n\nThe United States has already taken some steps to restrict the use of Chinese-made high technology. For example, it has restricted government procurement from Chinese tech giants Huawei and ZTE, which deny their products are used for spying by China's authoritarian government.\n\nIn June, the Defense Department suspended the purchase of all commercial, off-the-shelf drones until a cybersecurity risk assessment strategy was established. In 2017, U.S. customs authorities alleged that drones produced by Chinese company DJI, which has dominated the U.S. and Canadian drone markets, likely provided China with access to U.S. critical infrastructure and law enforcement data. DJI denied the allegation.\n\nThe commission is calling for Congress to push for assessments by U.S. government agencies on their supply chain vulnerabilities. It says the U.S. government depends on commercial, off-the-shelf products, many of them made in China, for more than 95 percent of its electronics components and information technology systems.\n\nLarge U.S. telecommunications providers also rely on global supply chains dominated by Chinese manufacturers. Although they do not source directly from Huawei and ZTE, major U.S. telecommunications providers rely on other foreign 5G network equipment suppliers that incorporate Chinese manufacturing in their supply chains, the report says.", "Now Playing: News headlines today: Nov. 13, 2018\n\nNow Playing: 2018 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade Preview\n\nNow Playing: Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloons inflate ahead of windy, chilly holiday\n\nNow Playing: Chief justice responds to Trump's judiciary criticism\n\nNow Playing: Dramatic video shows residents jumping through a window to escape fire\n\nNow Playing: 14-year-old pregnant girl killed by stray bullet, Atlanta police say\n\nNow Playing: NJ family was 'targeted' and killed before mansion fire in New Jersey: Prosecutor\n\nNow Playing: Thanksgiving by the numbers: average American consumes 4,500 calories on Thanksgiving\n\nNow Playing: New Jersey mansion fire being probed as quadruple homicide\n\nNow Playing: Aaron Rodgers donates $1 million to California wildfire recovery efforts\n\nNow Playing: Man sentenced to 34 months for raping dying woman\n\nNow Playing: Sara Haines surprises Michael Strahan with an emotional birthday tribute\n\nNow Playing: Kansas county commissioner resigns over 'master race' comment\n\nNow Playing: News headlines today: Nov. 21, 2018\n\nNow Playing: Exploring how faith and spirituality has helped guide newsmakers and more\n\nNow Playing: Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson discuss high-stakes matchup\n\nNow Playing: How a hurricane-devastated community is coming together for Thanksgiving\n\nNow Playing: Former NFL star Jeff Rohrer hopes his wedding to Joshua Ross 'helps current players'\n\nNow Playing: Your ultimate guide to navigating 2018 Black Friday deals", "An airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition killed at least seven civilians in Yemen's rebel-held port city of Hodeida, Yemeni security and medical officials said Wednesday.\n\nThe airstrike, which took place on Tuesday night, targeted a bus carrying civilians who were fleeing clashes, and also wounded four people, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.\n\nThe strike came a day after an informal agreement had been reached to reduce hostilities following advances by the coalition, which has spent months trying to seize the key Red Sea port from the Shiite rebels, known as Houthis.\n\nThe coalition made no comment on the strike.\n\nThe coalition forces are now 5 kilometers (3 miles) away from the port, which has served as a lifeline for goods and aid coming in to Yemeni civilians.\n\nAlso Wednesday, the United Nations Population Fund warned that the lives of at least 1,500 pregnant women caught in the fighting in Hodeida might be at risk as the city's only hospital that can provide emergency care becomes inaccessible.\n\nUNFPA said that 10,000 pregnant women are caught in the fighting in Hodeida.\n\nIt said health facilities across Hodeida have been closed or functioning at minimum capacity, straining al-Thawra Hospital, the province's major neonatal care facility that sees up to 500 deliveries per month.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition has waged war on the Iran-allied Houthis since March 2015.

Swearinger revenge tour already includes wins against two of his former teams, Arizona and Tampa Bay, this season.\n\nThose were warm-up acts for what takes place Sunday: a chance to beat the team the Washington Redskins safety said bashed him like no other.\n\nThat's why Sunday's game versus the Houston Texans will be a little more personal for Swearinger.\n\n\"Houston bashed my name pretty bad,\" he said.\n\nThe Texans drafted Swearinger in the second round in 2013, and he played two seasons there before they released him during the 2015 offseason. Tampa Bay claimed him off waivers the following day.\n\n\"I never got a fair chance from Tampa,\" Swearinger said recently. \"I remember my first interview with [coach] Lovie [Smith], he asked me about all the things Houston bashed me on. I was sitting there shocked, like, 'They really said that about me? This is horrible.' I took that and put that chip on my shoulder, like I never got that fair opportunity.\"\n\nWhen Houston drafted him, Gary Kubiak was the head coach. A year later, Bill O'Brien took over. Swearinger played mostly as a nickel linebacker under Kubiak, but he started as a strong safety under O'Brien.\n\nSwearinger preferred Kubiak's approach.\n\n\"Kubiak let me be myself, let me do whatever as long as I played ball,\" he said. \"O'Brien was a control guy: 'You can't do this. You can't do that.' It came to a point where the DB coach [John Butler] took something I said wrong about the film and told Coach O'Brien. I remember it like it was yesterday. We stopped the walk-through. He cut the walk-through short. O'Brien talked to me and all the defensive coaches and chewed me out, dog. I'll never forget that. I'm like, 'Dang.'\"\n\nOn a conference call with Washington reporters Tuesday, O'Brien said of Swearinger's accusations, \"I don't really know what D.J.'s talking about.\"\n\nSwearinger said the issue stemmed from a film session in which he said he reminded another defensive back about getting proper depth in a cover-zero call because the offense could use max protection. Swearinger left the room shortly thereafter. He said other defensive backs told him the position coach was upset.\n\n\"They said, 'When you left he was like, I don't know what Swearinger is talking about, but the blitz hits right here,'\" Swearinger said. \"I was like, 'Bro, I wasn't even talking about that play.' I was going off the film and he took something the wrong way and then they had that argument and I'm like, 'What's going on?' From that day, I never could be myself in Houston again. Bro, I'm talking about film and you tell that back to the coach? I don't know what to say. After that I could never find my groove.\"\n\nSwearinger said that's the reason Houston benched him for three games in the 2014 season. But he regained the starting strong safety job for three of the last four games that year. Then it was on to Tampa.\n\n\"In Tampa I had one of the most incredible camps in my life,\" he said. \"I haven't had a camp like that since. I picked off like 10 passes in camp; I had three punchouts. The next guy had like three [interceptions]. I was like there's no way I'm not starting. I started in the preseason and then they put Chris Conte back in. I'm like, OK. If they got their guys, they got their guys. It was crazy.

On Wednesday, the Switzerland-based International Union for Conservation of Nature updated mountain gorillas' status from \"critically endangered\" to \"endangered,\" a more promising, if still precarious, designation. There are now just over 1,000 of the animals in the wild, up from an estimated population of 680 a decade ago.\n\n\"In the context of crashing populations of wildlife around the world, this is a remarkable conservation success,\" said Tara Stoinski, president and chief scientist of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund.\n\nDian Fossey Gorilla Fund via AP, FILE\n\nThe Atlanta-based nonprofit is named for the primate researcher whose work helped draw international attention to mountain gorillas and whose memoir became the basis for the 1988 Sigourney Weaver film \"Gorillas in the Mist.\"\n\n\"This is a beacon of hope \u2014 and it's happened in recently war-torn and still very poor countries,\" said Stoinski, who is also a member of the IUCN's primate specialist group, which recommended the status change.\n\nMountain gorillas live in lush and misty forests along a range of dormant volcanoes in east Africa. Their habitat falls inside national parks spanning parts of Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nFossey, who died in 1985, had projected that the primates may be extinct by 2000. Instead, their populations have been slowly increasing thanks to sustained and well-funded international conservation efforts.\n\nDian Fossey Gorilla Fund via AP\n\n\"We have made progress in terms of their protection, in terms of allowing an environment where mountain gorillas can continue to thrive and grow,\" said Anna Behm Masozera, director of the International Gorilla Conservation Program, based in Kigali, Rwanda. \"But it's important to note that mountain gorillas' numbers could still slip back very quickly. We still have just two fragile and small populations,\" split between two national park areas.\n\nSeveral factors have enabled mountain gorillas' modest rebound, said Masozera.\n\nThe three governments have stepped up enforcement of national park boundaries \u2014 areas where hunting, logging and paved roads are illegal.\n\nTourism helps too: Visitors pay up to $1,500 an hour to watch gorillas, money that helps pay for park rangers.\n\n\"Primate ecotourism, done right, can be a really significant force for funding conservation,\" said Russ Mittermeier, chief conservation officer at Global Wildlife Conservation. \"It gives local governments and communities a tangible economic incentive to protect these habitats and species.\"\n\nThere's also health care. Gorilla Doctors, a nongovernmental group, has trained veterinary staff in each of the countries where the mountain gorillas live.\n\nHunting in the national parks is illegal, but nearby residents still set traps to catch other animals, such as antelopes. Those traps can also grab gorillas' arms and legs.\n\nWhen gorillas are found struggling with snares, the vets are called in to clean wounds. Kirsten Gilardi, U.S. director for the organization, called it \"extreme conservation.\"\n\nOther experts said the emergency vet interventions play a significant role in maintaining mountain gorilla populations.\n\n\"It's a total conservation win, and there aren't that many of them,\" said Gilardi.\n\nOn Wednesday, the IUCN also announced that bans on commercial whaling in the North Pacific Ocean and elsewhere had allowed some whale populations to rebound.

Toys R Us and Bon-Ton have liquidated. Sears Holdings Corp., which operates Sears and Kmart stores, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy last month. And J.C. Penney is floundering. Macy's says it's seeing increased business in the Midwest where Bon-Ton used to operate and it's aggressively courting its customers.\n\nBut Macy's focus is solidly on Macy's. It's been expanding its store label brands to differentiate itself from rivals. It's also adding more of its off-price Backstage stores and putting into place technology that allows customers to skip the line at the register.\n\nIt's rolling out multiple layers of technology to offer people something they can't get online, such as the use of virtual reality in its furniture and cosmetics sections. The company's revamped loyalty card program has helped keep its best customers engaged.\n\nAnd it's trying to become more nimble. Macy's acquired Story, a concept store, which rotates themes and what it sells every few months. It brought Story founder Rachel Shechtman aboard to help create a more vibrant shopping experience at Macy's.\n\nAnd in a more radical maneuver, the company is shrinking in order to grow.\n\nAfter closing more than 100 stores over the past several years, it's going to see how cluster of smaller stores work with today's customers.\n\nThe company released details of the new footprint to the Wall Street Journal earlier this week.\n\nCEO Jeff Gennette told industry analysts Wednesday that it's testing four different models for the new \"neighborhood stores\" format and promised to share details early next year.\n\n\"Macy's recipe for success is e-commerce, healthy stores and a great mobile experience that ties it all together,\" Gennette said, noting that the department store will hit a billion dollars in mobile sales this year.\n\nIt's still early, but industry watchers believe Macy's is on the right track in this altered retail landscape.\n\nNeil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said consumer tracking data supports the story of an ongoing recovery.\n\nAt this time last year, 59 percent of Macy's customers rated their shopping experience as good or very good, Saunders said, based on its research. This year that figure has risen to 67 percent, Saunders said. He wrote that his data also show that for the first time in over eight years, the number of people saying they will visit Macy's to do holiday shopping has risen.\n\n\"Along with the good sales numbers, these pieces of evidence underline that Macy's is succeeding in creating a stronger appeal,\" he wrote.\n\nMacy's Inc. reported third-quarter profits of $62 million, or 20 cents per share.

Jordan Blue, a student in the top right of the photo whose arms remain at his sides, said in a statement that the photo was taken as students gathered at the Sauk County Courthouse for professional prom photos and that he \"couldn't leave the photo as it was taken within five seconds.\"\n\n\u201cThe photographer told us to raise our hands kind of in a way, and I knew at that point that some my classmates are very immature,\" he said in a separate interview. \"So didn\u2019t want to do that, and I saw what was happening and I felt so upset.\u201d\n\nPete Gust, who operates Wheel Memories and has a son in the photo, refuted this on Tuesday in an interview with the Associated Press, saying he was asking the teens to wave goodbye to their parents before they headed off to the dance and never anticipated the image would draw such a visceral reaction. Gust said that the timing sequence of the shot he took of about 60 boys outside the local courthouse showed the students' arms extended in different stages as they raised them.\n\n\"There was nothing intended in any way shape or form to simulate anything that was offensive to anyone,\" Gust told the AP. \"If there's any error, it was me in timing the shot.\"\n\nJonathan Schieber, a senior who appears in the photo, told ABC News there was no discussion of any racist aspect to the photo when it was taken. It was only after the photo garnered social media attention over the weekend that he started to hear about it. Schieber, who is black, was singled out due to his race, though he had both arms at his side in the photo.\n\n\"Somebody had made a meme or something, saying, 'We even got the black kid to throw it up,'\" Schieber told ABC News. \"I couldn't go nowhere without people being like, 'Are you that kid from the picture? Everybody was sharing it, talking about racial profiling. I went to school on Monday and people were trying to take pictures with me -- you're going viral, all that stuff.\n\n\"I left school because I was not having it,\" he added.\n\nWheel Memories posted thumbnails of several photos from the shoot on its website in the spring, including the one in question. The photos have since been removed and the agency wrote on its site in a message that it blames \"jerks\" and online negativity.\n\n\"It is too bad that there are those in society who can and do take the time to be jerks; knowingly and willingly to be jerks! The internet can be a wonderful tool but for some there is an overwhelming urge to destroy. The destruction may not be physical but instead it can be bullying that is intellectual or emotional,\" the photo agency wrote on its website.\n\n\"To anyone that was hurt I sincerely apologize. To those who have harmed them, we as society often ignore them I have chosen not to do that. YOU ARE JERKS! Grow up!

But the Italian government stuck with its spending plans and refused to budge from its budget deficit forecast for next year of 2.4 percent of annual GDP.\n\nThe worry in Brussels and in financial markets, where interest rates on Italian bonds have spiked sharply, is that the budget plans would debt from falling, as promised. The interest rate on Italy's benchmark 10-year bond rose 0.03 percentage point Wednesday to 3.48 percent.\n\nIn his letter to the Commission, Economic Minister Giovanni Tria said Italy needs social spending to address growing poverty resulting from earlier austerity measures, and that the rollback on pension reforms would help renew the labor market and get young people working.\n\nTria said the government's budget plan would help bolster Italy's growth. Italy has stagnated for years and its economy, the third-largest in the eurozone, has lagged its main European partners. He said growth would rise \"thanks to the fiscal expansion the new reforms, the relaunch of investments and the reduced fiscal pressure on small businesses.\"\n\nWolfango Piccoli of Teneo consultancy said political considerations ahead of European elections would likely mean that sanctions on Italy won't materialize until late spring, \"if they materialize at all.\"\n\nItaly did make some minor changes to its budget in its response to the commission. For example, it said it would sale government property. However, analysts said the sale program was unlikely to deliver the 1 percent of GDP targeted by Italy.\n\nThe budget clash and economic uncertainty generated by the populist government have already been costly to the Italian economy. According to calculations by the Turin-based Hume Foundation, Italian government bonds, corporate bonds and the Italian stock exchange have shed 175.5 billion euros ($200 billion) in value since May.", "A child at the center of a custody dispute that may have set off a gruesome Ohio massacre is safe in state custody, her great-grandfather said Wednesday, before one of the four suspects in the killings appeared in court.\n\nLeonard Manley, whose daughter and grandchildren were among the eight people killed in 2016, told The Cincinnati Enquirer the 4-year-old girl is in state custody.\n\nOne of the suspects, Edward \"Jake\" Wagner, was the long-time former boyfriend of 19-year-old Hanna Rhoden, one of the victims, and shared custody of their daughter at the time of the massacre.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Wagner's father, another of the suspects, agreed to return to Ohio following his arrest in Kentucky. George \"Billy\" Wagner III was arrested after being found in a horse trailer in Lexington Tuesday. The 47-year-old Wagner waived his rights to an extradition hearing in a brief appearance Wednesday in Lexington district court.\n\nThe announcement of Wagner's arrest along with his wife and two adult sons marked the culmination of a massive investigation that began after seven adults and a teenage boy were found shot in the head at four separate rural Ohio homes in April 2016. The killings terrified Ohio residents and spawned rumors that it was a drug hit, but prosecutors suggested Tuesday the attack had stemmed from a custody dispute.\n\nThe investigation is one of the most complicated and extensive in state history, with enormous numbers of witnesses and a huge amount of evidence, said Pike County Prosecutor Rob Junk.\n\n\"There is a lot of hard work ahead of us. I cannot emphasize that enough. An indictment is only the beginning of the case,\" Junk said Tuesday, adding the case may have to be moved to a different county because of pre-trial publicity.\n\nOther Pike County officials are concerned about the costs and issues they will face in housing the suspects, such as added security and other needs. County Commissioner Blaine Beekman said Wednesday the county of 28,000 is already in a budget crunch and officials plan to meet with Junk before reaching out to state officials for help.\n\n\"Obviously, we are pleased that the arrests have been made and that, if the evidence is there, the people will be brought to justice,\" Beekman said. \"But it's a double-edged sword. ... Now comes the reality of how are we going to pay for this? We have no book to refer to. There are just so many unknowns.\"\n\nOhio Attorney General Mike DeWine said a grand jury indicted the Wagners on aggravated murder charges. Police arrested Wagner; his wife, 48-year-old Angela Wagner; and his sons George Wagner III, 27, and Edward Wagner, 26. They could be sentenced to death if convicted, DeWine said.\n\nEdward Wagner was also charged with unlawful sexual conduct with a minor for having sexual contact with Rhoden when she was 15 years old and he was 20 years old, DeWine's office said.\n\nDeWine gave scant detail about why the victims were killed, other than saying the custody of a young child played a role.\n\nTony Rhoden, who lost two brothers in the killings, said the family was still processing the news.\n\n\"We just don't know what to think,\" Rhoden told the Columbus Dispatch. \"It's a lot to take in.\"\n\nThe Wagner family lived near the scenes of the killings about 60 miles (97 kilometers) south of Columbus. They moved to Kenai, Alaska, in June 2017, then returned to Ohio this past spring.\n\nKelly Cinereski, an Alaskan pastor and friend of the family, told the Dayton Daily News he was shocked by their arrests.\n\n\"These people wept over dogs, I can't imagine them taking people's lives,\" he said.\n\nFredericka Wagner, the mother of Billy Wagner, and Rita Newcomb, the mother of Angela Wagner, were also arrested and charged with misleading investigators.\n\nBoth Edward Wagner and Angela Wagner previously told the Cincinnati Enquirer they were not involved in the killings.\n\nAngela Wagner said in an email to the newspaper what happened was devastating and Hanna Rhoden was like a daughter to her. Wagner also told The Enquirer her husband, George, and Christopher Rhoden Sr. were more like brothers than friends.\n\nJohn Clark, a lawyer who has been representing the Wagners, has said previously that four of the Wagner family members provided laptops, phones and DNA samples to investigators and agreed to be interviewed about the slayings.\n\n\"We look forward to the day when the true culprits will be discovered and brought to justice for this terrible tragedy,\" Clark said in a statement.\n\nThe victims were 40-year-old Christopher Rhoden Sr.; his ex-wife, 37-year-old Dana Rhoden; their three children, 20-year-old Clarence \"Frankie\" Rhoden, 16-year-old Christopher Jr., and 19-year-old Hanna; Clarence Rhoden's fianc\u00e9e, 20-year-old Hannah Gilley; Christopher Rhoden Sr.'s brother, 44-year-old Kenneth Rhoden; and a cousin, 38-year-old Gary Rhoden.

They have been in the Misrata port ever since, with the captain and crew taking refuge on the upper decks.\n\nBy late Wednesday, at least 77 remained on board after more than a dozen of the migrants agreed to leave with the Libyan coast guard for a nearby detention center \u2014 including a woman and her infant. The others refused, saying Libya was deadly for migrants and they wanted to go to Europe.\n\nOne of the migrants, a man from South Sudan reached by The Associated Press on the ship, vowed on Wednesday to reach Europe or die trying. He said six commercial ships passed his group before the Nivin finally stopped.\n\nLibya's coast guard had no immediate comment on the situation.\n\nWith just one rescue ship patrolling the Mediterranean, and European ports refusing to take in rescued migrants, commercial ships have become increasingly leery of picking up people in the sea. Repeatedly in recent months, they have found themselves caught in the middle between governments hostile to new migrants and an obligation under international maritime law to save\n\nThe man, who identified himself only by his name, Victor, fearing for his safety, said he himself had already been imprisoned repeatedly in Libya and that his own brother had died there. He had no intention of returning, he said.\n\n\"We don't want to go out in Libya,\" he told The Associated Press. \"You can come and take my dead body outside.\"\n\nJulien Raickman, who is the head of the Doctors Without Borders mission in Libya, said Europe's policy of refusing to take in rescued migrants has led to a spike in deaths. Now one in five who cross perishes at sea, he said.\n\nRaickman said the Libyan coast guard has given international organizations access to the migrants, who have food and some degree of medical care now, but no toilets or other sanitary facilities. The ship's cargo of cars was peacefully unloaded, but the migrants remained unmoved.\n\n\"We're afraid that this dispute will end in violence. The people who are on board are determined. They know that they went far and could face charges for taking control of a boat,\" he said. \"But these are people motivated by despair.\"", "A five-member North Korean delegation came to South Korea on Wednesday to attend an academic forum on Japan's wartime actions, as the rivals continue reconciliation efforts despite stalemated U.S.-led nuclear diplomacy.\n\nThe North Koreans are among 300 people from nine countries who are taking part in Friday's forum near Seoul. The meeting will discuss Japan's forced mobilization of laborers in the region during World War II and how to boost exchanges now among Asia-Pacific countries.\n\nThe North Koreans are led by Ri Jong Hyok, vice chairman of the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee. Participants from other countries including South Korea, Japan and China, are mostly civilian scholars and former officials. Ex-Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, who has been apologetic about Japan's past wrongdoing, will represent the Japanese side, according to organizers.\n\nThe forum is organized by Gyeonggi province, which surrounds Seoul, and a South Korean civic organization. The South Korean government has said it has no plans to meet with the North Koreans during their four-day visit.\n\nAnti-Japanese sentiment runs deep in both Koreas because the Korean Peninsula was colonized by Japan for 35 years before its division at the end of World War II in 1945. However, the Koreas have rarely taken joint steps to tackle history and other issues stemming from the colonization because of their decades-long split.\n\nRelations between the Koreas have improved this year, with the North entering disarmament talks with a vague promise to achieve complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. U.S.-North Korea talks have reported little recent progress as skepticism has grown over whether the North is truly committed to disarmament.", "Transcript for Uber and Lyft to face competition from Waymo\n\nToday's tech bikes Hoover and live may soon be facing a wave moved competition.

It noted that refiners, for example, possess exact information about the origin of mined gold \u2014 in contrast to the information provided in customs declarations.\n\nThe report says Switzerland, like other countries, has been taking measures in recent years to respond to the threat of human rights violations in the industry.\n\n\"Switzerland is committed, at the national and international level, to ensure that gold produced in violation of human rights is not imported into Switzerland,\" it said, claiming Swiss law is among the toughest in the world already on the issue.\n\n\"However it can't be totally ruled out that gold produced in violation of human rights is imported into Switzerland, even if businesses and producer governments have put in place an array of measures aimed to prevent it from happening,\" the report said.", "Cities along the East Coast are bracing for the first snowfall of the season this week.\n\nA storm is set to develop in the Gulf Coast Wednesday and track along the East Coast on Thursday and Friday, bringing rain, freezing rain, flooding, snow and sleet throughout the South and the Northeast.\n\nA mix of snow and ice in Mississippi on Wednesday morning caused a bus to crash in DeSoto County.

The agency said exports were down and imports were up in the third quarter, meaning there was a net drag coming from trade compared with the previous three-month period.\n\nThe economy ministry said in a statement that \"one-time effects in the third quarter lead to an interruption of the upswing\" as major automakers including Daimler and Volkswagen had difficulty getting new cars certified under tougher emissions testing standards. That led them to discount cars ahead of the Sept. 1 test deadline, and caused a shortage of cars to sell to consumers afterward.\n\nMoritz Degler, an economist at Oxford Economics, said that the drop in auto production and its knock-on effects through the industry's supply chain could have taken a half-percentage point off gross domestic product.\n\n\"This implies that the economy didn't slow much from 0.5 percent growth (in the second quarter),\" he said.\n\nHe foresaw the economy bouncing back to 0.6 percent growth in the fourth quarter as the auto impact fades: \"Germany's dire Q3 GDP figure is much more a reflection of the country's overreliance on an outsized automotive sector, than it would suggest a further decline in eurozone growth momentum.\"\n\nThe drop followed increases of 0.5 percent in the second quarter and 0.4 percent in the first. It comes as growth is slowing across the 19-country eurozone economy. Economists say that the easing in growth will likely not be enough to make the European Central Bank cancel plans to end its 2.5 trillion-euro ($2.9 billion) bond purchase stimulus at the end of the year.\n\nING economist Carsten Brzeski says signs point to a rebound, but that the third-quarter decline is \"another wake-up call that political stability and strong growth are by no means a given.\"", "Over the last decade, Black Friday weekend became a bona-fide sales event in the car business. In 2015, for example, it accounted for more than 18 percent of all car deals made that month.\n\nBut Black Friday isn't the sales juggernaut it once was.\n\nJust as other retailers now push \"Early Black Friday\" sales right after Halloween and online brands hype their Cyber Monday specials, carmakers have morphed Black Friday into Black November \u2014 and beyond. In 2017, Black Friday weekend represented less than 14 percent of the month's sales. Edmunds analysts expect this downward trend to continue this year.\n\nFor car shoppers, the trend translates to greater flexibility and less stress. Here's what you need to know about getting a great deal.\n\nTHE LEFTOVER EFFECT\n\nThe sales season is extending partly because carmakers are more willing to let outgoing models linger at dealership lots.\n\nThe trend showed up in earnest early this year. In March 2018, roughly 28 percent of new vehicles sold were brand-new 2017 models. Compare that with the previous five years, where leftover inventory made up just 12 percent of March sales on average.\n\nEdmunds analysts predict that at least 20 percent of new vehicles for sale early next year will be 2018 models. Based on inventory levels of new 2018 models currently on dealer lots, expect to see a good supply of new 2018 midsize sedans, midsize SUVs and compact SUVs as late as March 2019, along with specials to move them out.\n\nIf you're a bargain hunter, that's good news. Instead of having to shop on just one weekend, you have more time to snag a great deal.\n\nSHOULD I BUY NOW?\n\nStart price-shopping immediately if you know the make and model you want. Once you've got a good feel for how much the car will cost now, you may want to pull the trigger if you fall into any of these categories:\n\n\u2014 You're planning to lease your next vehicle: Because of the way leases are calculated, waiting isn't likely to help you.\n\n\u2014 Your local dealership is running an aggressive promotion: It's possible that a dealership selling the brand you're after might have a unique sales goal to hit. It could offer Black Friday incentives to get you to buy now. Free iPads, televisions or in-house zero percent interest loans are some of the perks dealerships have used to entice shoppers in years past.\n\n\u2014 You're looking for something specific: The longer you wait, the less selection you'll have. While prices on 2018 models may continue their slide through the first quarter of 2019, a low price on the wrong vehicle is a bad compromise.\n\n\u2014 The vehicle you're eyeing has a special low-interest rate offer: Interest rates are rising, and that trend is expected to continue. If you've found an attractive price on the right car, and the interest rate is a good one (given the times), you might want to make a deal. If you wait for a lower selling price but get saddled with a higher interest rate, you haven't done yourself any favors.\n\nSHOULD I WAIT?\n\nYou may want to consider holding off on your purchase if you fall into any of these categories:\n\n\u2014 You plan to purchase with cash: As cars languish on dealer lots, chances are that good prices will go even lower. If you're paying cash and aren't concerned with rising interest rates, waiting may save you money.\n\n\u2014 Your vehicle needs are flexible: Most of the hot products are going to be sold first. If you don't mind selecting from what's left in exchange for a lower selling price, it may make sense to wait.\n\n\u2014 Your credit is iffy: Maybe you can't get a low interest rate now because of your credit profile, but you still want to get a heavily discounted clearance vehicle. Use this time to improve your credit standing so you'll be able to take advantage of clearance pricing and a low interest rate in early 2019.\n\nEDMUNDS SAYS: Black Friday is still an excellent time to buy a car. But unlike the doorbuster deals at your local big-box retailer, the Black Friday specials at a car dealership are likely to be around well after the holiday weekend.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

The GOP stands hollowed out of America\u2019s suburbs, with Democrats defeating at least 23 Republican incumbents along their way to netting plus-31 (and counting) House seats.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the backdrop against which a Trumpier Republican conference chooses between Kevin McCarthy and Jim Jordan to lead its ranks in the House. Trump has stayed out of the contest publicly, but many of the outside groups that help power the Trump agenda have taken sides, even as McCarthy remains the odds-on favorite for the post.\n\nBefore Republicans surrender their majority, Trump could test his allies on Capitol Hill with a possible government shutdown over border-wall funding.\n\nBill Clark/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images\n\nThe RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks\n\nDemocrats have felt better since Election Day, which is why, perhaps, they are willing to start rumbling about 2020 already, just one week after voters went to the polls.\n\nPriorities USA, a powerful, Washington, Democrat Super PAC held a briefing with reporters Tuesday afternoon to spin and chart out their initial plans for the next, upcoming election cycle already.\n\nWest Virginia State Sen.

Bruce Poliquin, R-Maine, isn't going down without a fight.\n\nPoliquin filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court Monday arguing that because he received the most votes in Maine's 2nd Congressional District last week, he should be declared the winner.\n\nIt seems simple enough until you remember that Maine -- following a drawn-out battle involving two statewide referenda -- utilizes ranked-choice voting in its federal races. Because Polquin didn't receive a 50 percent-plus-one majority, he did not win and the votes of the election's non-competitive independent candidates will now be transferred to their supporters' second and third choices in the race until the threshold is surpassed.\n\nStanding to benefit is Poliquin's Democratic challenger Jared Golden, who only trails the Republican by about 2,000 votes and who it is widely assumed is the major party candidate preferred by most independent voters, hence Poliquin's lawsuit.\n\nChallenges to the system have failed in the past and the will of Mainers clearly sides with ranked-choice, so it is unclear if Poliquin has a chance to cut the vote off at one round. For its part, the Maine secretary of state\u2019s office -- named as the defendant in the lawsuit -- is continuing to scan and certify ballots as if the second-round tabulation will continue.\n\nRobert F.

According to the group, witnesses saw one person being \"kidnapped\" from the Beijing campus, while others in Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Shanghai also disappeared.\n\nThey were involved in a coalition, led by young Marxist activists, that was founded this summer to show solidarity with factory workers at Jasic Technology, a welding equipment manufacturer in southern China.\n\nActivists in China are routinely \"disappeared\" by authorities working for the ruling Communist Party, which is wary of any collective action and potential threats to its authority. The government is particularly guarded about campus movements after the 1989 student-led pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square that were ultimately crushed by the military.\n\nThe young Marxists are an unusual target, however, because they espouse the same values \u2014 socialism, workers' rights and Marxist ideology \u2014 the party has advocated.\n\nThe sudden disappearances all occurred around 9 p.m. on Friday, the Jasic Workers Support Group said. Three others in Wuhan, including one factory worker, were taken away by police on Sunday, though one was released early the next day.\n\nPeking University students and alumni expressed alarm after students published accounts online saying that they were beaten on campus by unidentified men who forced a recent graduate named Zhang Shengye into a car on Friday evening.\n\nIn a statement posted on an internal Peking University forum, the school's security department said the \"situation\" on Friday was that of a \"police department lawfully taking into custody a criminal suspect ... who is not a current student, teacher or employee of the school.\"\n\nA member of the security department confirmed over the phone Wednesday that the statement came from the university.\n\nOne fourth-year history student, writing on the Jasic Workers Support Group's website, said he was thrown to the ground outside of a lecture hall by five people dressed in black.\n\nWhen he asked them who they were, he recalled, one swore at him and yelled, \"If you keep yelling, we'll keep hitting you!\" Shortly afterward, a tall, burly man started kicking his head.\n\nThe student said he then saw that someone was being dragged into a car that swiftly drove away.\n\nThe student who wrote this account could not be reached on Wednesday. Members of the Jasic Workers Support Group, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they believe he has been forced to leave campus for the time being.\n\nSomeone who identified himself as a third-year Peking University medical student said in an online post Wednesday that he had a similar encounter on that same night, when people in dark clothing rushed at him and held him to the ground until he bled.\n\nThirteen Peking University alumni attached their names to a public letter Wednesday evening protesting the treatment of the students, who said they were beaten.\n\nDecrying the \"illegal, gang-like violence,\" they wrote, \"Peking University should be a place where rule of law thrives!\"\n\nZhang, who graduated from Peking University's pharmaceutical school this year, was a vocal member of the Jasic Workers Support Group. He was among about 50 young people from across the country who convened in an apartment near Shenzhen in August to rally behind Jasic factory workers who were fired for trying to form a union.\n\nThe apartment was stormed by police in riot gear and the group members were detained for a few days before authorities escorted them back to their hometowns. Several had their phones confiscated for the remainder of the summer and continued to be hounded by police back home, according to a student who took part in the action.", "It's Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018.

In a statement released by her spokeswoman, the first lady called for Deputy National Security Adviser Mira Ricardel to be fired: \u201cIt is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House.\u201d\n\nIt was an unusual move for the normally discreet first lady to be publicly involved in staffing issues.

Amazon announces HQ2 in NYC, Northern Virginia\n\nDozens of cities across the country pitched Amazon on becoming the site of its second headquarters, and after a year of hype, the e-commerce giant chose New York City and a suburb of Washington, D.C.\n\nThe company will invest a total of $5 billion in the new locations, bringing 50,000 jobs to the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens and Arlington, Virginia, in exchange for more than $2 billion in incentives, Amazon announced in a statement.\n\nCritics are questioning Amazon's motives with the HQ2 sweepstakes if the company was ultimately going to choose two of the richest areas in the country.

That helped send prices lower. Brent crude is trading below $70 per barrel, down from a four-year high above $86 per barrel in early October.\n\nBrent prices rose 0.6 percent on Wednesday to $65.86 at 1115 GMT (6:13 a.m. EST).\n\nThe Paris-based agency welcomed the higher production and stockpiles, saying that the response to the call by the IEA and others to boost production \"is a reminder that the oil industry works best when it works together.\"\n\nThe agency said that lower prices \"are clearly a benefit to consumers,\" especially those in developing countries who are seeing higher fuel prices due to weak national currencies. Oil is priced in dollars and the U.S. currency has been strong of late.\n\nThe report authors warned that although the market seems more relaxed than a few weeks ago, rising stocks should be \"welcomed as a form of insurance\" against unpredictable market events. The report notes that \"the United States remains committed to reducing Iranian oil exports to zero from the 1.8 million barrels per day seen today.\"\n\nThere were also concerns about the stability of production in Nigeria, Libya, and Venezuela, while a tanker collision in Norwegian waters, though modest in impact, \"is another reminder of the vulnerability of the system to accidents.\"", "The Latest on the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, meeting this week in Singapore (all times local):\n\n5:35 p.m.\n\nSingapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong says a final agreement on a Southeast Asian-centered free trade agreement will be pushed back until 2019.\n\nLee's comments Wednesday confirmed earlier expectations that the 16 countries in the plan, called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, would not meet their goal of finalizing the accord within this year.\n\nThe plan includes China, India and other major regional economies but not the United States.\n\nLee says officials have made significant progress but are unable to bridge all their differences.\n\nHe told a meeting of leaders of the countries involved in the RCEP that the accord will send a strong signal about free trade while further delays would mean missed opportunities.\n\nThe RCEP would involve 40 percent of world trade.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n10:20 a.m.\n\nSoutheast Asian leaders and China are touting progress in keeping peace in the contentious South China Sea as they work toward a \"code of conduct\" to govern navigation routes and other activities in the region.\n\nSpeaking at the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Singapore, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang cited the region's management of territorial disputes as an example and said the trend was toward greater stability.\n\nPhilippine President Rodrigo Duterte said he wanted at \"all cost\" to set the rules governing behavior in those seas to avoid trouble.\n\nDuterte told reporters that relations between China and its Southeast Asian neighbors were \"excellent\" and that friction was between Western nations and China.

More recently, mysterious billboards have appeared in the region accusing its politicians of separatism. And a dispute has erupted over the legality of the community acquiring dual Hungarian citizenship.\n\nThe incidents have left many worried that even as Ukraine strives to bring its laws and practices closer to European Union standards, its policies for minorities seem to be heading in a far more restrictive direction.\n\n\"There is a sort of purposeful policy, which besides narrowing the rights of all minorities, tries to portray the Hungarian minority as the enemy in Ukrainian public opinion,\" said Laszlo Brenzovics, the only ethnic Hungarian in the Ukrainian parliament. He called the separatism charges \"extraordinarily absurd\" and a means to distract from Ukraine's domestic problems.\n\nBrenzovics' party, the KMKSZ, has launched its own campaign with bilingual billboards reading \"Let's not allow peace to be destroyed in Transcarpathia!\"\n\n\"This is a peace campaign to calm the mood,\" said Livia Balogh, a party official in Chop, a once-booming railroad city of 9,000 people on the border with Hungary. \"Hungarians here are mostly surprised and tense but also angry that the minority card is being played.\"\n\nWith a presidential election expected in March, Ukraine is also facing an ongoing armed conflict on its eastern borders with Russian-backed separatists. Officials say the new language rules in education, to be implemented over several years, serve a unifying purpose.\n\n\"Education is the fundament to social cohesion, which is also the fundament of security in the country,\" said Anna Novosad, a senior official at Ukraine's Ministry of Education and Science. She attributed Russia's annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014 partly to the disintegration and linguistic isolation of the local, mainly Russian-speaking population from the rest of Ukraine.\n\n\"This is something that we would like not to repeat in the western part of our country,\" Novosad said.\n\nVasyl Filipchuk, a Ukrainian diplomat and chair of the board of the International Center For Policy Studies in the capital Kiev, said the anti-Hungarian campaign was being used to distract voters.\n\n\"It's artificial, manipulative technology\" to overshadow the real problems of the people \u2014 corruption, lack of jobs and lack of economic prospects, Filipchuk said, adding that the use of patriotic, nationalistic rhetoric is \"very dangerous.\"\n\nSome of the issues have triggered a diplomatic dispute between Ukraine and Hungary, with Hungary blocking Ukraine's talks on integration with the European Union and NATO until the language stipulations in the education law are revised. In early October, Ukraine expelled a Hungarian consul after a secret video surfaced of Ukrainian Hungarians taking the oath of Hungarian citizenship. In response, Hungary expelled a Ukrainian consul.\n\nAlmost all members of Ukraine's Hungarian minority live in Transcarpathia \u2014 called Zakarpattia Oblast in Ukrainian and Karpatalja in Hungarian. The last census, from 2001, counted 151,000 Hungarians, but unofficial estimates now see around 120,000.\n\nScores have emigrated to Hungary and western Europe, driven in part by Ukraine's economic crisis and facilitated by the possibility of acquiring dual Hungarian citizenship, which comes with a European Union passport.\n\nIt's a community that is still strongly tied to Hungary \u2014 everyone seems to set their watches to Hungary's time zone, an hour behind Ukraine's.\n\nJozsef Kantor, principal of a high school with some 700 students in Velyka Dobron, a village near Chop with a majority Hungarian population, acknowledged that a more modern education law was needed. Still, he lamented the \"much harsher and unfavorable education law\" now proposed.\n\nAt Kantor's school, which is undergoing renovations paid mostly by subsidies from the Hungarian government, Ukrainian language and literature are the only classes not taught in Hungarian. National authorities seem open to developing Ukrainian language textbooks which would take into account the fact that many Hungarian children enter school without speaking much, if any, Ukrainian.\n\nMany of the school's graduates are taking advantage of having an EU passport to get their higher education in Hungary or elsewhere abroad.\n\n\"What affects us negatively is that many of them don't come back,\" Kantor said. \"Ultimately, if this continues for 20 or 30 years, there's a risk that the intellectual class among Hungarians in Transcarpathia will shrink significantly.\"\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has made a name for himself in Europe through his unrelenting anti-immigration and nationalist policies, has made supporting the estimated 2.2 million Hungarians living in neighboring countries \u2014 lands that Hungary lost after World War I and the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire \u2014 a key objective.\n\nSubsidies totaling some $60.1 million have been given to institutions, businesses and families abroad since 2017, and Brenzovics, the lawmaker, said the payments have helped establish 3,000 new businesses.\n\nOfficials have simplified steps for Hungarians abroad to acquire dual Hungarian citizenship. An initial goal of adding 1 million dual citizens \u2014 on top of Hungary's population of some 10 million \u2014 was achieved nearly a year ago.\n\nOrban's efforts have created a political windfall. In April's elections, over 95 percent of voters casting ballots by mail \u2014 mostly from neighboring countries \u2014 backed Orban's coalition led by his Fidesz party, helping him to a third consecutive term.\n\nIn Chop, teacher Zsuzsanna Dzjapko, a Hungarian whose husband's family is Russian-Ukrainian, has accepted the fact that the best educational prospects for their 11-year-old daughter Rebeka \u2014 who speaks all three languages and is a talented singer and musician \u2014 are across the border.\n\n\"I don't have hopes that she'll come back, because as a Hungarian folk singer in this country, she wouldn't have much of a future,\" Dzjapko said in a small apartment shared by three generations. \"We hope the times will change, the winds will change and the laws will change, as well.\"", "bad url", "A band of House Democrats determined to oppose House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's speaker bid are planning to release a signed letter as soon as this week indicating that they have gathered enough support to deny her the 218 votes needed to win the gavel on the House floor in January, a move they say would complicate her path to a second term as speaker and force renewed discussion about her stepping aside.\n\nInterested in Democratic Party?

Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., a rising star in the party who is running for a lower-level post, said Tuesday. \"She's a smart woman.\"\n\nAP\n\nOne option her allies are exploring is tinkering with the threshold she needs to clinch the gavel: Pelosi can win on the floor with less than 218 votes if she can convince her critics not to vote, or vote \"present,\" instead of for her or another candidate. They are also making the case to incoming members that voting against her in caucus but for her on the floor (in support of the caucus recommendation) will provide them with sufficient cover for their re-election races.\n\nCharlie Neibergall/AP\n\nPelosi's allies have also been quick to criticize the group vowing to block her as working to derail the will of the majority of House Democrats, and have ridiculed the group for not being able to find a candidate to challenge her for speaker head-on.\n\n\"If they\u2019re foolish enough to sign their names to a letter when they don't have to, when they don\u2019t know whether Pelosi is going to win or lose, and when they don\u2019t even have a candidate to oppose her, then it doesn\u2019t bode well for their leadership if they succeed,\" a Pelosi confidant told ABC News.\n\nBut Pelosi's critics say they don't need a candidate of their own to challenge her.\n\n\"There\u2019s a very practical political reason why no one has come out.

Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said EU leaders had penciled in a Nov. 25 Brexit summit to discuss the deal \u2014 though he cautioned nothing was guaranteed and much could still go wrong.\n\nThen May will need to win backing from Britain's Parliament \u2014 no easy task, since pro-Brexit and pro-EU legislators alike are threatening to oppose it.\n\nThe main obstacle to a withdrawal agreement has long been how to ensure there are no customs posts or other checks along the border between the U.K.'s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland after Brexit. Britain and the EU agree that there must be no barriers that could disrupt businesses and residents on either side of the border and undermine Northern Ireland's hard-won peace process.\n\nThe proposed solution involves a common customs arrangement for the U.K. and the EU, to eliminate the need for border checks, with some provisions that are specific to Northern Ireland.\n\nThe solution is intended to be temporary, but pro-Brexit politicians in Britain fear it may become permanent, hampering Britain's ability to strike new trade deals around the world.\n\nPro-Brexit former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the agreement would make his favored option, a loose Canada-style trade deal with the bloc, impossible. He tweeted: \"Cabinet must live up to its responsibilities & stop this deal.\"\n\nNorthern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May's minority government, said it would oppose any deal that leaves Northern Ireland subject to different rules to the rest of the U.K. after Brexit.\n\nDUP chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson said the proposed deal threatens \"the constitutional and economic integrity of the U.K.\"\n\n\"That is not something we can support,\" he told the BBC.\n\nMay also faces growing opposition from pro-EU lawmakers, who say her proposed Brexit deal is worse than the status quo and the British public should get a new vote on whether to leave or to stay.\n\nSophie in 't Veld, a Dutch member of the European Parliament who is deputy to the legislature's Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt, said the real problem during the negotiations \"lies within the U.K., within the government, within the Tory party, between the parties, because there has not been any agreement over the relationship with the EU between any of them over the last two years.\"\n\n\"That is the real problem, because if the U.K. had a single agreed line, backed by the majority of parties and the majority of MPs, then the whole situation would not be so unclear,\" she said.", "Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi rebuffed criticism from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and other leaders Wednesday over her government's treatment of its ethnic Rohingya Muslims.\n\nIn a meeting on the sidelines of a regional summit in Singapore, Pence told Suu Kyi that he was anxious to hear about progress in resolving the crisis, which stems from a violent military crackdown in Myanmar's Rakhine state that the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing.\n\n\"The violence and persecution by military and vigilantes that resulted in driving 700,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh is without excuse,\" Pence said.\n\nHe added that he was eager to hear about how Myanmar will enable the Rohingya to voluntarily return home. Pence also said Myanmar's arrest and conviction of two Reuters journalists was \"deeply troubling\" to millions of Americans.\n\n\"I look forward to speaking with you about the premium that we place on a free and independent press,\" said Pence, who is representing an administration with an unusually adversarial relationship with the news media.\n\nPence and Suu Kyi met during the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Singapore.

He said the treatment of the Rohingya was \"indefensible.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Mahathir toned down his comments, saying that ASEAN leaders try to avoid criticizing each other. He said the issue of Rohingya had come up during a working dinner among the leaders but the main sentiment was a desire to resolve the problem.\n\nSuu Kyi became an icon for democracy after spending about 15 years under house arrest for opposing Myanmar's earlier military dictatorship.\n\nThough she has been the de facto head of Myanmar's civilian government since her party swept elections in 2015, she is limited in her control of the country by a constitution written under the former military junta. The military is in charge of security operations, including those in Rakhine.\n\nStill, Suu Kyi has faced widespread criticism for not speaking out in defense of the Rohingya. Amnesty International became the latest organization to strip her of an award this week, citing the \"shameful betrayal of the values she once stood for.\"\n\nResponding to Pence, Suu Kyi said it was good to exchange views, but that \"we understand our country better than any other country does. I'm sure you will say the same of yours, that you understand your own country better than anybody else.\"\n\n\"So we are in a better position to explain to you what is happening, how we see things panning out,\" she said.\n\nAfter the meeting, senior U.S. administration officials said Pence and Suu Kyi had discussed the importance of having Rohingya return home, but only on a voluntary basis, with safety and dignity.\n\nPence also urged Suu Kyi to pardon the imprisoned journalists.\n\nMyanmar's government and most of the nation's Buddhist majority say Rohingya are \"Bengalis\" who migrated illegally from Bangladesh, and do not acknowledge the Muslim minority as a local ethnic group even though they have lived in Myanmar for generations.\n\nA Bangladesh official said Wednesday that authorities are ready to begin repatriating more than 2,200 Rohingya refugees to Myanmar.

Add Interest\n\nIsrael's defense minister on Wednesday abruptly resigned to protest a new cease-fire with Hamas militants in Gaza, throwing the government into turmoil and pushing the country toward an early election.\n\nAvigdor Lieberman's decision was ostensibly a show of anger over Tuesday's informal truce with Israel's Hamas enemies. But in many ways, it was the opening round of a new political campaign.\n\nHis defection leaves Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with the narrowest of parliamentary majorities \u2014 only 61 of 120 seats in his coalition.\n\nIn theory, Netanyahu can continue to govern until parliamentary elections scheduled for a year from now. But with another coalition rival, Naftali Bennett, threatening to leave the coalition if he doesn't get the defense portfolio, the days of Netanyahu's government appear numbered.\n\nHere's a closer look at the developments:\n\nNETANYAHU'S CEASE-FIRE\n\nAfter two days of heavy fighting, Netanyahu's decision to accept the Egyptian-brokered truce was more than a case of cooler heads prevailing.\n\nThe longtime Israeli leader knows well that the military option has its limits. Israel has maintained a crippling blockade on Gaza and fought three wars against Hamas since the Islamic militant group seized power in 2007. This has inflicted heavy damage on Gaza, but Hamas remains firmly in power.\n\nOusting the group would require a military operation that could take months and cost the lives of thousands of Palestinian civilians and many Israeli soldiers. Reluctant to pay such a price, Netanyahu instead seems content to keep a weakened Hamas in check.\n\nNetanyahu may also have a deeper agenda. Leaving the Palestinians torn between two governments \u2014 Hamas in Gaza and the internationally backed Palestinian Authority in the West Bank \u2014 works in his favor.\n\nWith the Palestinians weak and divided, there is little pressure for Netanyahu to make concessions, allowing him to expand West Bank settlements and cement Israeli control over the territory.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has repeatedly accused Israel and the U.S. of collaborating behind his back and preparing a peace plan offering the Palestinians a mini-state in the Gaza Strip and small autonomous areas of the West Bank. That falls short of his demand for a fully independent Palestinian state that includes both territories in full.\n\n\"It isn't true that Netanyahu doesn't have a policy. He does: He is a firm believer in perpetuating the status quo,\" wrote Israeli columnist Nahum Barnea.\n\nBIBI'S BOUNCER\n\nLieberman is a former aide to Netanyahu who has been both an ally and rival over the years. He currently heads Yisrael Beitenu, a small ultranationalist party that appeals to immigrants from the former Soviet Union.\n\nA brawny former nightclub bouncer known for his sharp tongue and Russian-accented Hebrew, the Soviet-born Lieberman has sought to project an image as a gruff, tough-talking politician. At times, he has been critical of Israel's Arab minority, liberal opposition groups and even Israel's Arab ally Egypt. Sitting in the opposition, he once threatened to assassinate Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh if he held the defense portfolio.\n\nBut as defense minister, Lieberman's accomplishments remain limited, and Haniyeh is alive and well in Gaza.\n\nCalling the cease-fire \"surrender to terrorism,\" Lieberman also made clear that his frustrations run much deeper. He said he also opposed a recent decision to allow Qatar to deliver $15 million in aid to Gaza and the cancellation, under heavy international pressure, of the planned demolition of a Bedouin village in the West Bank.\n\n\"We are buying quiet in the short-term at the cost of severe damage to our security in the long-term,\" he said. \"The weakness we displayed also projects itself to other arenas.\"\n\nIS NETANYAHU THREATENED?\n\nIf Netanyahu calls early elections, opinion polls forecast a broad victory by his Likud Party and his hard-line partners, including Lieberman.\n\nWith his resignation, Lieberman appears to be positioning himself for elections by painting Netanyahu as soft and portraying himself as a defense hawk.\n\nBennett, another former Netanyahu aide who leads the religious Jewish Home Party, is likely to use a similar strategy. Like Lieberman, Bennett had favored tougher military action against Hamas.\n\nAll three appeal to a similar bloc of voters. Although Netanyahu would likely emerge as the leader, siphoning off votes would strengthen his rivals and give them increased leverage.\n\nNetanyahu's rivals are eager to tap into public anger over the cease-fire. Residents in rocket-battered towns in southern Israel, typically Likud strongholds, have protested the truce.\n\nLieberman is especially desperate. His party holds only five Knesset seats, barely above the threshold required to enter the parliament.\n\nNetanyahu, meanwhile, will probably market himself as the responsible adult in a room of inexperienced children.\n\n\"I see the big picture of Israeli security that I cannot share with the public,\" he said Wednesday as he defended the cease-fire. \"In times like these, leadership is not doing the easy thing. Leadership is doing the right thing, even if it is hard. Leadership is sometime facing criticism.\"\n\nOne wild card: Police have recommended indicting Netanyahu in a series of corruption investigations. If Israel's attorney general decides to file charges, Netanyahu could be weakened or even forced to step down, shaking up any election campaign. However, if he is re-elected before a decision is made, it could make it much harder to press charges against a leader with a fresh mandate. Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit has not said when he will decide.\n\nHAPPY HAMAS\n\nIn Gaza, Hamas declared victory in the latest round of fighting, boasting that it stood up to the powerful Israeli military. Large crowds of supporters celebrated in the streets.\n\n\"The resistance has sent a clear message to the occupation that it can hurt them,\" boasted Ismail Radwan, a Hamas spokesman.\n\nAfter the dust settles, Hamas will once again have to cope with running a territory where unemployment is over 50 percent, the economy is in tatters and where people cannot travel abroad.\n\n\"We have to bear in mind that Hamas' popularity has improved on similar occasions in the past,\" said Mkheimer Abusada, a Gaza analyst. \"But that was for a short period of time, after which people would face the harsh reality of unemployment and poverty.\"\n\nHamas will return its focus toward U.N. and Egyptian mediation aimed at easing the crippling Israeli blockade in exchange for assurances of quiet.", "Al-Qaida was giving away motorcycles up in the mountains \u2014 that's what the kids in town were saying the day Abdullah disappeared.\n\nEarly that morning, Mohsanaa Salem woke her 14-year-old son to go buy vegetables. The sun had just risen above the mountain ridge, and winter light filled the ravine where their mud brick house sat at the foot of a slope. \"Let me sleep,\" Abdullah groaned from a mattress on the floor, surrounded by his brothers and sisters.\n\nOne word from his father, though, and the boy was up and dressed, trudging out of the house to the market in a neighboring village. Three hours later, when he still hadn't returned, Mohsanaa and her husband began to worry.\n\nThey were a family trying to get by in Yemen, a nation at war with itself that has become a battleground for more powerful countries.\n\nThey knew that many families like theirs had been caught in the middle, with thousands killed in fighting between Iranian-backed rebels from the north, known as Houthis, and forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition trying to restore the ousted government.\n\nThey knew that al-Qaida militants were based in the mountains, sending fighters out to battle the Houthis, while trying to elude missiles fired from U.S. drones that often killed innocents.\n\nAnd they knew Abdullah was a good boy, though a bit naive. He never strayed far \u2014 just to school or to play soccer with his friends in a lot so close his mother could see it from the house. At about 10 a.m., Mohsanaa and her husband called around to the couple dozen other families who lived in their village to ask if anybody had seen Abdullah.\n\nNo one had, and his parents' worry grew to panic.\n\n\u2014This story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.\n\nAll around al-Said district, in Yemen's southern Shabwa province, people heard the American drone overhead on the morning of Jan. 26.\n\nThat wasn't unusual. The sky often buzzed with drones hunting for the moment to strike at the al-Qaida militants, a mix of locals, foreign fighters and Yemenis from other parts of the country who had moved into the district.\n\nFrom above, the drone surveyed an inhospitable landscape of barren limestone mountains, creased with ravines and gorges. Zooming in on those threads of green, the drone would have scanned dozens of isolated villages like the one where Abdullah lived, each just a few houses above plots of land planted with wheat and animal fodder.\n\nAbdullah's village, Shaab Arshan, sits in a wadi just over 100 meters (yards) wide in places, the bare mountains rearing up steeply on either side. Ravines and gorges lead to slightly larger valleys that eventually open into desert, the fringes of the vast Empty Quarter that takes up much of the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nAl-Qaida fighters come down to the valleys to resupply and recruit in the markets. They pass out memory cards with their videos and lectures. They show up at weddings or funerals now and then, preaching to those in attendance. And they offer gifts to teens and young men, the most vulnerable and easily swayed to join their ranks.\n\nFor more than a decade, the United States has waged a drone war against al-Qaida in Yemen, trying to eliminate one of the most dangerous branches of the terror network. The Trump administration has dramatically ramped up drone strikes, carrying out more in two years than the Obama administration did over its entire eight years \u2014 176, compared to 154. More than 300 people \u2014 militants and civilians \u2014 were killed in 2017 and 2018 by one estimate.\n\nAt least 30 civilians were killed in 2018, The Associated Press found, based on accounts from family members and witnesses. A few weeks before Abdullah's disappearance, a drone's missile slammed into a farm in a neighboring province, killing a 70-year-old man and a young relative who had just returned from mediating a land dispute.\n\nBut here in al-Said district, it had been months since the last strike.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSoon after he left the house, Abdullah ran into a schoolmate who told him al-Qaida militants were giving away motorcycles in the town of Mosaynaa. The friend had heard it from a neighbor who belonged to the group.\n\nAbdullah had never thought of joining al-Qaida and he didn't want to now. He was in the 8th grade and dreamed of becoming a doctor one day. But he knew how to drive, and he wanted a motorcycle.\n\nThe boys agreed they would go get the motor bikes and come right home.\n\nThey caught a ride to the market in Yashbom, where Abdullah used part of the money his mother had given him to pay for a taxi to Ataq, the provincial capital on the other side of the mountain.\n\nAbdullah loved Ataq \u2014 the closest thing to a city the village boy had seen. His father took him and his siblings there to buy gifts at holiday times and new clothes before the start of school. He always pleaded with his parents to send him to school there as a reward if he made it to the top of his class.\n\nIt was there that his friend had been told to contact the militants who would take them where they needed to go. They had no idea how far away that would be.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAbdullah's parents expanded their search to nearby villages and called relatives in Ataq. No one had seen their boy.\n\nWhat if a driver had hit Abdullah and sped away? He could be lying by the side of the road, or maybe someone found him and took him to a hospital.\n\nAbdullah was their miracle child. Mohsanaa had complications in the pregnancy and gave birth to twins after only seven months. Abdullah's brother died within days, and doctors were sure Abdullah would die, too. He was tiny, hairless, and there were no incubators at the hospital.\n\n\"If you saw him, you'd think he was a doll, just the size of the palm of your hand,\" Mohsanaa said.\n\nWhen Mohsanaa brought Abdullah home, she wouldn't let anyone near him. She fed him formula. She kept him warm by spreading butter over his body and wrapping him in cotton. Every day, he got better, and by six months \"he became a normal baby,\" she said.\n\nIn an impoverished country where nearly four years of civil war have pushed millions to the brink of starvation, the family had much to be thankful for. Abdullah's father, Saleh bin Elwiya, worked as a taxi driver and made enough to feed his wife, four sons and four daughters.\n\nSaleh was a careful driver, plying the roads all day as far as Aden, southern Yemen's biggest city, on the coast. He adored his children and had taught all his sons to drive, except for the youngest, Abdel-Salam, who at 8 couldn't reach the pedals yet.\n\nHe always urged Abdullah to focus on his schoolwork.\n\n\"You just study, and I will take care of everything else,\" Saleh told him. \"I don't want you to end up a taxi driver like I did because I didn't finish school.\"\n\nNow his boy had vanished.\n\nSaleh's eldest son, Zayad, and a brother-in-law, Nabil, drove out to search the roads. The two were in the army together, on a week's leave from a front-line unit fighting the Houthi rebels. At every army checkpoint along the way, they described Abdullah to the soldiers, asking if they'd seen him: A tall, lanky boy, baby face, not a trace of whiskers?\n\nFinally, a soldier outside Ataq said yes. He'd seen him passing in a car. It was welcome news: At least they knew Abdullah had made it this far.\n\nSaleh headed for Ataq in his taxi. There, he joined his relatives, searching in the markets and at taxi stands, going street by street, alley by alley through the city. He spoke little, growing more tense with every futile turn.\n\nAs night fell, they gathered at the home of Saleh's brother in the Russian Compound, a housing complex on the city's edge, built in the 1980s when Soviet experts were here searching for oil. Zayad called his mother. Still nothing, he told her.\n\nMohsanaa told him to stay there and wait until morning to resume the search. She didn't want them driving around in the dark.\n\n\"Things happen at night,\" she said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOn the outskirts of Ataq, Abdullah and his friend met a militant, who drove them in a Land Cruiser along a desert highway to Mosaynaa, through an area where Abdullah had never been before. He realized he had been gone for a long time and hadn't told his parents where he was. He thought about turning back but didn't have the nerve to say anything.\n\nThey passed through Mosaynaa, and the car wove up into the mountains to the al-Qaida fighters' camp. In a tent, they all had a meal of chicken and rice and Pepsi, but there were no motorcycles. It was too late to leave, so they would have to stay the night. The militants gave the boys a phone to send a message to their parents, and Abdullah texted his father: \"I am with al-Qaida. I'll come back tomorrow. Don't come for me.\"\n\nThe boys were offered a tent, but decided to sleep in a nearby crevasse, under some trees. They were worried about airstrikes.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWhen he received the message in Ataq, Abdullah's father tried calling back to the militant's phone. It was turned off. They had to move right away, Saleh told his relatives, or else \"I won't be able to get him back.\" Once in al-Qaida's hands, Abdullah would be gone forever, sent to fight the Houthis or strapped with a suicide belt \u2014 or he might be hit by a drone.\n\nWith al-Qaida, \"all roads lead to death,\" said one of Saleh's nephews.\n\nDespite his wife's warnings, Saleh got back into the taxi and drove into the night, joined by Zayad and Nabil, along with two of Saleh's nephews who offered to help.\n\nThe search party asked around the shops and eateries still open in the markets. They learned that the boys had been there hours earlier, heading for the mountains.\n\nSaleh had never been to Mosaynaa and didn't have the tribal links needed to find his son. He needed local help, so he went to one of the few families he knew, the al-Tolsi family.\n\nThe al-Tolsi brothers were beekeepers, a common trade in Yemen, a country known for its honey. One of the brothers had links to al-Qaida, but he wasn't there when Saleh and his relatives appeared at the door of the family house. Instead, it was another brother, named Mubarak.\n\nMubarak was not connected to al-Qaida and had status in the community, working as the imam at the local mosque and performing the daily call to prayer. He welcomed the men in and offered them dinner. Over the meal, his guests explained why they had come. Mubarak said he was happy to take them to the mountains in the morning. It was too dark now. But Saleh was insistent.\n\nMubarak gave in. The beekeeper and his nephew, Naguib, a geology student at a local oil university, joined them, setting out at 10 p.m. At the foot of the mountains, they sought out a local man known to be a look-out for al-Qaida. He belonged to the same tribe as Mubarak, so they knew they could ask him to take a message to the militants: There is a man here who wants his son back.\n\nAs the look-out went up the mountain, the seven of them waited below in Saleh's taxi.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAt around 11:30 p.m., an operator pressed a button in a U.S. military base \u2014 perhaps in neighboring Saudi Arabia, perhaps as far away as Nevada or Georgia \u2014 launching two Hellfire missiles from a drone cruising above the mountain. Abdullah heard explosions in the valley and, terrified, started to cry.\n\nThe hours passed slowly to daybreak, when Abdullah and his friend made their way down the mountain. Part way down, they saw a mangled car below. At the bottom, Abdullah recognized the license plate: His father's taxi.\n\nThe missiles had reduced the car to burned wreckage. Abdullah's father and brother and the other five people inside were torn to pieces.\n\nThere were no bodies. Overnight, militants had rushed to the site and taken the remains to Mosaynaa, but their blood was everywhere.\n\n\"It was shocking. I wept,\" Abdullah said. \"I realized he had come looking for me.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNews of the deaths in a drone strike fanned out across the district, passed by WhatsApp messages and phone calls.\n\nOne of Mubarak's brothers, Ahmed al-Tolsi, was away in the neighboring province of Marib, taking their bees to flowers there. He got a message and rushed home to Mosaynaa to bury his kin.\n\n\"He is a generous man who received this family, gave them dinner and told them he would help them bring back their child,\" he said of Mubarak. \"He was doing something good and got killed.\"\n\nIn Ataq, one of Saleh's nephews heard a knock on the door at dawn. \"Your brothers and uncle are in God's embrace,\" a neighbor said.\n\nThe remains of Saleh and his relatives were taken to the town of Yashbom, where Abdullah's odyssey began, and laid out under sheets in the mosque. Saleh's legs were gone; Zayad's body was cut in half.\n\nIn keeping with Muslim custom, the five were buried right away in the Yashbom cemetery.\n\nAbdullah's mother woke at dawn for morning prayers, still worrying about Abdullah. At 7:30 a.m., neighbors arrived dressed in black for mourning and told her the news: Saleh and the others had been hit by the drone. They were all dead.\n\n\"It's not possible. We talked in the evening,\" Mohsanaa said. \"I told them not to go out at night.\"\n\nShe was terrified that Abdullah had been killed as well.\n\nThen Abdullah appeared. He had walked four hours to get home and found the crowd of mourners gathered at his house. He sat alone under a tree nearby, trembling, afraid he would be blamed, until the men went over and reassured him. Mohsanaa had her son sit beside her and placed her hands on his head.\n\nTribal leaders sent emissaries to the al-Qaida fighters to demand they leave the area. But months later, Abdullah still blamed himself, not al-Qaida or the U.S.\n\n\"It was my all mistake,\" Abdullah said. He speaks in short, muddled sentences, stooped over and looking down at his fingers.\n\n\"I was the reason why my father and brother, my uncle and cousins all died.\"\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed that it carried out a strike in Shabwa province on Jan. 26, saying it was targeting al-Qaida. It does not release details or death tolls in drone strikes, spokeswoman Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich said.\n\nEver since, the families have tried to prove their slain loved ones were not militants. They gathered letters from everyone they could \u2014 police officers, district officials, tribal leaders, school principals \u2014 certifying that their relatives did not belong to al-Qaida. They spoke to human rights groups and the International Committee of the Red Cross, asking for an investigation.\n\nThey even held a demonstration in Ataq, attended by some 200 people, reading out a statement demanding the U.S. acknowledge that the victims were not al-Qaida and pay compensation to the families.\n\nTheir voices have not been heard. The U.S military has an official mechanism for families to request compensation for relatives mistakenly killed \u2014 a few families in Iraq and Pakistan have succeeded \u2014 but there is no U.S. Embassy in Yemen, so there is nowhere for Saleh's family to submit evidence that they were civilians.\n\nAbdullah's family has shards of the missiles that killed the seven men. They keep the shrapnel printed with serial numbers wrapped in a blanket hoping one day to present it as evidence in an investigation.\n\nMohsanaa doesn't believe she'll ever see justice for the killing. With her husband gone, she scrapes by on a meager pension and tries to manage her family's grief. She doesn't speak of the killing in front of Abdullah. A pious woman, she knows he mustn't blame himself.\n\n\"This is God's verdict. If it wasn't written, they wouldn't have gone,\" Mohsanaa said. \"What's the child's guilt? He is a victim. He's a poor boy.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Lee Keath in Cairo contributed.", "Bangladesh authorities said they are ready to begin repatriating some of the more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims who have fled from army-led violence in Myanmar since last year. But refugees scheduled to leave said they would refuse to go because of fears for their safety.\n\nSome said their families have fled from their shanties in the refugee camps to avoid being sent back. The situation remained tense in camps overnight.\n\nRefugees, Repatriation and Rehabilitation Commissioner Abul Kalam said earlier Wednesday that 30 refugee families would be handed over Thursday at the Ghumdhum border point near Cox's Bazar, where refugees have been living in crammed camps.\n\nBut by late Wednesday, confusion grew over whether it would start.\n\nKalam said late Wednesday that they discussed the situation with the U.N.'s refugee agency, which gave a report after discussion with the refugees who are on the list. The U.N. does not want the government to send the refugees back under current circumstances.\n\nDetails of the repot were not shared, but Kalam said they wanted to be \"hopeful\" in beginning the repatriation on Thursday.\n\n\"We hope we will be able to confirm tomorrow morning (Thursday) how many we are taking,\" he said.\n\nThe two countries had originally agreed to begin repatriating Rohingya to Rakhine State last January, but that was called off amid concerns among aid workers and the Rohingya that their safety wasn't guaranteed.\n\nKalam said about 2,260 refugees from 485 families would be sent back in an initial group. Myanmar officials said recently that they would receive 150 refugees each day.\n\nBut it was unclear whether the repatriation would begin smoothly amid reports that many of the refugees on the initial list have fled.\n\n\"I will not go. My wife and other family members have gone elsewhere, they do not want to go,\" 35-year-old Nurul Amin told The Associated Press outside the Jamtoli camp, where he and his family have been living for more than a year.\n\n\"I stayed back to guard my valuables,\" he said. \"If you say you will shoot us if we do not agree to go back, we will welcome bullets, we still will not go.\"\n\nMohammed Selim, 23, said his wife and seven other family members went into hiding after finding out that they would be sent back.\n\n\"We are grateful to the Bangladesh government, the Bangladeshi people for their help. Please do not force us to go,\" he said.\n\n\"If we need to go, we demand that we go back to our homes, not to any camps there. We have our land, we have our homes,\" he said.\n\nOn Sunday, the Myanmar government said it was ready to welcome returning refugees.\n\nIt said returning Rohingya would stay at repatriation camps for two days and receive food and clothing before moving on to transit camps. It said China, India and Japan were \"providing necessary assistance\" for the repatriation process.\n\nDespite the promises by Myanmar, human rights activists say conditions are not yet safe for their return.\n\nLast week, the U.N.'s independent investigator for human rights in Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, called the plans \"rushed\" and said she was concerned there were no guarantees that the refugees would be protected from new persecution if they return home.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross is one of the few humanitarian organizations operating in Rakhine state. Its U.N. observer, Robert Mardini, said Wednesday that conditions are not right for Rohingya refugees to return.\n\nHe told several reporters that the conflict between the Rohingya and Myanmar's government is not resolved, and \"so many\" Rohingya villages in northern Rakhine are flattened that there is no place to go back to.\n\n\"We still believe that the conditions are not right for voluntary, safe, dignified returns, and our concerns are for people to be able to move freely, to be safe and secure, and have a normal life,\" Mardini said. \"Nobody can claim today that the security in Rakhine is so well established that people can return safely.\"\n\nForeign leaders have criticized Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi this week on the sidelines of a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Singapore for her handling of the Rohingya crisis.\n\nRohingya began fleeing into Bangladesh after Myanmar security forces launched a brutal crackdown following attacks by an insurgent group on guard posts in August 2017. The scale, organization and ferocity of the operation led to accusations from the international community, including the United Nations, of ethnic cleansing and even genocide. Myanmar's government has denied the accusations.\n\nMyanmar officials said Sunday that returnees can get an ID document called a national verification card that will allow them to travel in the Maungdaw area of Rakhine state, and that they can then begin to apply for citizenship.\n\nBut there is widespread skepticism that any of returning refugees will ever be granted citizenship.\n\nMost people in Buddhist-majority Myanmar do not accept that the Rohingya Muslims are a native ethnic group. They are viewed as \"Bengalis\" who entered illegally from Bangladesh, even though generations of Rohingya have lived in Myanmar. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since 1982, effectively rendering them stateless. They have also been denied freedom of movement and other basic rights.\n\nMany people who fled earlier violence and moved into displacement camps inside Myanmar have been unable to leave those settlements for years.\n\nMost Rohingya have lived in poverty in Rakhine, near the Bangladesh border. Marked by their religion and their language \u2014 most speak a dialect of Bengali, while most of their neighbors speak Rakhine \u2014 they are easy to target.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Tofayel Ahmad in Cox's Bazar and Edith M. Lederer at the United Nations contributed to this report.", "For decades, the NFL has had a strong bond with the military. That relationship stretches far beyond the pregame and halftime ceremonies that honor veterans, and particularly ratchets up in November with the league's Salute To Service.\n\nThis year, the NFL and the Bob Woodruff Foundation have partnered to find and grant funds to organizations helping former military members. So far, 38 organizations have received grants, some in the spring and others this fall.\n\n\"One of the things we have come across are just an unbelievable amount of nonprofit organizations working to support the veteran and military community,\" says Anna Isaacson, the NFL's senior vice president of social responsibility. \"There are some reports of 40,000 such organizations.\n\n\"We hear from these organizations and we want to help every one we can, but that is sometimes difficult. The commissioner had a relationship with the Bob Woodruff Foundation and learned about the process they go through to determine which organizations should receive grants, and that there could be an awesome partnership as a grant referral pipeline. They can take our salute dollars and put them to use with the organizations doing the most impactful work in this landscape.\"\n\nThe Woodruff Foundation was founded in 2006 after reporter Woodruff was hit by a roadside bomb while covering the war in Iraq. Its $2 million affiliation with the NFL bolsters the grant work done by the foundation.\n\n\"We have now been through ... basically a whole year of granting with the NFL,\" says Dr. Margaret Harrell, the director of programs and partnerships for BWF. \"The Woodruff Foundation brings our expertise to help the NFL select the most effective and important programs that are serving the post-911 veteran population. It's a really nice partnership to ensure an increasing number of veterans benefit around the country.\n\n\"There hasn't been a huge learning curve because it's been such a delightfully smooth partnership; we have a shared interest.\"\n\nAdds Isaacson: \"This came together in our world somewhat quickly. There already are (22) organizations receiving a grant from the NFL and BWF, and some organizations we may not have partnered with have had the opportunity to engage in a partnership.\"\n\nOne of those groups is the Furniture Bank of Atlanta, a relatively small local company with a full-time staff of 11 that received a grant in October. Furniture Bank serves about 40 families a week, providing furniture to veterans and others who had been homeless and have now found a place to live. A bed for each person, plus tables, chairs, a sofa, a dresser \u2014 as many as 14 pieces, mostly used, that have been donated to the company \u2014 are supplied.\n\nBut the group takes it several steps further for those vets. It puts them to work .\n\nSome of the former military members become interns and load and unload Furniture Bank trucks. Others who show the initiative and know-how can become drivers, which allows the bank to increase its delivery schedules.\n\n\"Before we had the program, we had the idea to start an internship for someone who is homeless, help them to get a license (to drive a box truck),\" says Megan Anderson, executive director of Furniture Bank of Atlanta. \"We realized in 2014 we could expand that and the internship was a good fit with our warehouse and trucks. We had United Way seed money, and could take on 10 to 12 veterans who had to be homeless or just moving into housing.\n\n\"They work on our trucks for eight weeks, get a small stipend ... and then can go the warehouse route and get certified or get their license to drive the trucks.\"\n\nAnderson stresses that the folks they are helping are motivated to help themselves . After all, they served in the military, where motivation is a given stimulus.\n\n\"One thing we noticed, more recently out of the military members especially, is they are hard working, punctual, and have a strong appreciation for teamwork,\" she says. \"A lot of teamwork is involved here. They certainly can work as a unit. We also found multiple veterans have that camaraderie and help encourage each other.\n\n\"Maybe someone is homeless and another veteran just got an apartment, and another has a job. If someone has been homeless a while, they are pretty hopeless to some extent. Maybe they have bad luck with employment or have not been treated well, and they lose trust. It helps to see others who have succeeded.\"\n\nAnderson is certain the affiliation between the NFL and BWF has helped her group and will help others who apply for the grants. She emphasizes how easy the application process is on the NFL or BWF website, as does Harrell.\n\n\"From our perspective, the partnership between the Bob Woodruff Foundation and the NFL made applying to the foundation and getting the grant seem more accessible for a local and small organization,\" Anderson says. \"That is how we learned about this opportunity and it seemed more feasible, and it was OK that we were just working in Atlanta, which I thought was cool.\"\n\nHarrell notes that the public could get the wrong impression that all veterans are struggling when they make the transition from the military; that's far from accurate. But the work done by Furniture Bank of Atlanta is essential.\n\n\"The group Furniture Bank is serving is a group that has considerable challenges in their post-military lives,\" she explains. \"The organization gives these individuals the benefit of the doubt and works with them on an individual basis, provides them with credentials for the future, and keeps them on board long enough for Furniture Bank to vouch for them as an employee.\"\n\nShe offers a reminder to those groups that have applied but not received NFL/BWF grants that they won't be forgotten. Of the roughly 200 that BWF expects will submit a proposal, the foundation requests a further proposal from around 30 to 40 submissions, although it will engage in feedback with all 200.\n\n\"There is no set number of grants or a set grant amount,\" she says. \"It depends on the need and scope of the program and the level we can handle. Of the 200 proposals we receive, we probably wind up granting to only a small portion, but we re-engage with them to explain where their proposal did not meet what we were seeking.\n\n\"I am very confident, given our expertise from the foundation, that the money goes to the best organizations and we are excited to see especially local small programs that we were not familiar with being recognized.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP\u2014NFL", "Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny says he's been able to fly out of Russia after being told he was barred from leaving the country a day earlier.\n\nNavalny was traveling to France to attend a hearing of his case at the European Court of Human Rights when he was stopped at a Moscow airport on Tuesday and told that he had been barred from leaving Russia because of a bailiff ruling.\n\nNavalny posted a picture of himself at passport control at a Moscow airport on Wednesday morning, saying that he has now been allowed to leave the country. He said on Tuesday that the bailiffs had not notified him that they had issued a ruling to collect some $31,000 in damages in a civil lawsuit against him. The money was promptly paid.", "The United States has waged a drone war in Yemen for 16 years, trying to suppress al-Qaida's branch here. But the campaign has had a hidden cost: civilians cut down by the drones' missiles.\n\nThere is no comprehensive count of civilian deaths because of the difficulty of confirming identities and allegiances of those killed. But in an examination of drone strikes this year alone, The Associated Press found that at least 30 of the dead likely did not belong to al-Qaida.\n\nThat is around a third of all those killed in drone strikes so far in 2018. The Pentagon does not release its assessment of the death toll, but an independent database considered one of the most credible in tracking violence in Yemen counted 88 people \u2014 militants and non-militants \u2014 killed by drones this year.\n\nThe AP count gives a glimpse, even if incomplete, into how often civilians are mistakenly hit by drone strikes, at a time when the Trump administration has dramatically ramped up the use of armed drones. It has carried out 176 strikes during its nearly two years in office, compared to the 154 strikes during the entire eight years of the Obama administration, according to a count by the AP and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.\n\nThe AP based its count on interviews with witnesses, families, tribal leaders and activists. Most of those killed, 24, were civilians; at least 6 others were fighters in pro-government forces \u2014 meaning ostensibly on the same side as the U.S. \u2014 who were hit in strikes away from the front lines while engaged in civilian life.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe drone toll goes almost unnoticed in the region's conflicts. Immensely greater destruction has been wreaked by U.S. allies in the Saudi-led coalition's air campaign against Iranian-backed Shiite rebels known as Houthis. More than 57,000 civilians and combatants have been killed in Yemen's civil war, by some estimates, and thousands more may have died of starvation caused by the conflict.\n\nYet the killing of a single man \u2014 Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, slain by Saudi operatives in his own country's consulate \u2014 has raised more international uproar than any of those deaths in a war waged by a coalition led by Saudi Arabia and baked by the U.S.\n\nIn comparison, the toll from U.S drones in Yemen runs in the hundreds, including both militants and civilians. Several databases are trying to track the deaths, with varying results. The Bureau for Investigative Journalism counted up to 1,020 killed by strikes from 2009 to 2016, under President Barack Obama, compared to up to 205 killed in 2017 and 2018. Another database, by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, counted 331 killed the past two years.\n\nCounting civilians among those numbers is complicated by the difficulty in determining who belongs to al-Qaida in a country of multiple warring militias. Al-Qaida has joined the battle against the Houthis, and many of its fighters are incorporated into militias armed and funded by the U.S.-backed coalition.\n\nThe campaign has scored some military successes. In 2015, U.S. strikes took out Nasser al-Wahishi, the top leader of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP as the Yemeni branch is known, and several senior lieutenants.\n\nBut drones have been most effective in forcing al-Qaida to limit its movements and hide in the mountains, avoid large gatherings and restrict cellphone use. The group withdrew from areas it controlled in the south but was allowed to keep weapons and money under secret deals it struck with the United Arab Emirates, a coalition member.\n\nOver the years, the cost of the pursuit of senior leadership has been high.\n\nFor example, the U.S. has killed at least 66 civilians, 31 of them children, in the unsuccessful hunt for one man, Qassim al-Rimi, one of AQAP's founders who in 2015 succeeded al-Wahishi as the group's chief.\n\nThose deaths came in two raids reportedly targeting al-Rimi. The first was in 2009 in the southern village of al-Majalah. The second came on Jan 27, 2017, only days after Trump's inauguration, in a U.S. special forces assault on a village in Bayda province.\n\nThe civilian deaths come in a war conducted from a vast distance.\n\nDrone pilots work remotely at American bases, most often in the U.S., sometimes on 11- to 14-hour shifts housed in rooms like shipping containers lined with electronics. They operate based on intelligence from informants but they also carry out so-called \"signature strikes,\" based on observing suspicious patterns of behavior. They have a list of characteristics, and if a subject on the ground shows a number of them, he could be targeted, a former participant to the drone program told the AP, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the operations.\n\nMistakes happen from bad intel or misjudging behavior, he said. Rights groups have expressed concern that some of the intelligence may come from prisoners held in jails run by Emirati-backed militias where torture is widespread.\n\nSome of the strikes from 2018 that the AP examined appeared to be mistakes.\n\nOn Jan. 1, a drone missile slammed into a farm in Bayda province where 70-year-old Mohammed Mansar Abu Sarima sat with a younger relative, killing both, according to a relative, Mohammed Abu Sarima.\n\nThe slain men had just returned from mediating a local dispute. In a country where tribal links are powerful and the justice system nearly non-existent, such mediations are common to resolve conflicts over land or deaths. They involve large gatherings of tribesmen who are often armed, potentially raising drone operators' suspicions.\n\n\"We don't have any affiliation. They are simple farmers who don't know how to read or write,\" said the brother. \"We live in fear. Drones don't leave the sky.\"\n\nSeveral weeks later, a 14-year-old shepherd, Yahia al-Hassbi, was struck by a drone as he tended goats several kilometers (miles) from a checkpoint that al-Qaida had tried recently to seize. He was killed along with a construction worker passing by at the time, according to relatives and three local human rights workers, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\n\nFurther east, in Hadramawt province, drones carried out several consecutive days of strikes in March, targeting vehicles on a main highway. Some of the strikes killed al-Qaida militants, according to rights activists in the area.\n\nBut others struck down cars carrying people who had fled to the area from a nearby province, Jawf, to escape fighting. A drone's missile on March 5 killed a 10-year-old boy, Ammer al-Mahshami, and wounded the driver, according to three relatives. Four days later, another car was hit, killing six men and boys, including a 14-year-old and an 18-year-old, travelling to a funeral.\n\nSaleh al-Wahir, the brother of one of the dead, was in a car behind them. \"I saw it before my eyes,\" he said of the blast. \"Bodies were ripped apart.\" A report from the Jawf Human Rights office concluded the men were civilians.\n\nSurvivors are rare. Adel al-Mandhari recounted how his car was thrown through the air by the blast of a drone's missile. He lost his legs and an arm and was burned all over his body. The four others in the car \u2014 his brother, uncle, cousin and another relative \u2014 were all killed. None were connected to al-Qaida, said al-Mandhari, a civil servant. Two other relatives and the three rights workers in Bayda confirmed his account.\n\nSince the attack, al-Mandhari has spoken to the media and rights groups, seeking ways to get compensation and an apology from the U.S. \"I lost hope,\" he said. \"Nothing is going to happen.\"\n\nEven some strikes that the AP did not include in its count may have killed civilians, though there is some dispute over them.\n\nOn May 14, two men, Hussein al-Dayani and Abdullah al-Karbi, were killed when a drone struck their pickup truck in an area of Shabwa province where al-Qaida is known to have a presence.\n\nAl-Dayani's brother, Khaled, denied they were militants. He said his brother was a fighter in a militia battling the Houthis. \"We are against those people,\" Khaled said of al-Qaida.\n\nTwo weeks later, a 17-year-old, Mahdar Hussein al-Hag, died in a strike while driving his motorcycle in the same area. Mahdar's father said he was a high school student and was returning from buying vegetables. \"He might have been mistaken for al-Qaida youth who are active in this area.\"\n\nA Yemeni security official said the dead in those strikes were all al-Qaida members, though he did not provide evidence.

Median household income around Amazon's planned campus is $130,000 a year, poverty is half the city average and new buildings were going up long before the tax overhaul.\n\n\"All you have to do is look at the skyline from Manhattan. You can see billions of dollars of private investment there already,\" said Don Peebles, a real estate developer based in New York. \"Long Island City doesn't strike me as high on the list for needing extensive tax incentives to stimulate economic development.\"\n\nUnder the new tax law, officials in each state designated 8,700 such zones across the country. Nearly 35 million Americans live in such areas, communities that in most cases have high poverty and unemployment, or contain or are near pockets in desperate need of development.\n\nThe site of Amazon's other new headquarters in Crystal City, Virginia, is not in an opportunity zone, nor is the site of another major Amazon office in Nashville, Tennessee, that was also announced Tuesday.\n\nAmazon did not mention the Long Island City opportunity zone tax breaks Tuesday in any of its announcements about the new campus. Company spokesman Adam Sedo declined to provide details about whether Amazon plans to take advantage of them.\n\nBut investors were already pouncing.\n\nCraig Bernstein, founder of the investment fund OPZ Capital, said the capital gains break is good public policy because it helps push investors to put up the money for new housing, which may be in high demand once Amazon fills an expected 25,000 new jobs in the neighborhood.\n\n\"This will help expedite the process of building up the surrounding area,\" Bernstein said.\n\nBernstein said his fund is looking at investing in two buildings near the Amazon site to develop into mixed retail-residential space. With Amazon moving in, he said, he sees another reason to take a risk: a \"captive audience\" of workers looking for apartments and shops.\n\nSeparately, Amazon is tapping New York state and the city for grants and tax breaks worth about $2.8 billion.\n\nInvestors who plow capital gains into Opportunity Zone projects can defer taxes on those gains up to 2026. If they decide not to cash out on their investment for up to seven years, they receive another benefit. They get to exclude up to 15 percent of those gains from taxes. And they can completely exclude paying taxes on any further appreciation of those gains if they hold onto the investment for a decade. Capital gains taxes can be as high as 23.8 percent.\n\nThe $2.5 billion that Amazon said it will spend building its Long Island City campus could save Amazon potentially hundreds of millions on its federal tax bill.\n\nFund manager Bernstein said that he is not familiar with Amazon's tax situation, but that any company that is allowed to delay paying tax is getting the equivalent of an interest-free loan from the government. That benefit alone on $2.5 billion in gains is worth about $150 million in interest saved through 2026, assuming a conservative borrowing rate of 3.5 percent. Add in the portion of gains the company is excused from paying any tax on, and that would bump the savings to at least $225 million.\n\nCritics worry that such sweetheart tax savings would benefit real estate interests aiming to invest in areas that are already on the rise, or are bolstered by their proximity to expanding institutions such as hospitals or colleges.\n\nA Brookings Institution study of the administration's list of more than 8,700 opportunity zones found that nearly a third were already gentrifying, based on such factors as rent increases and the percentage of college-educated residents.\n\nThe Treasury Department, which approved the state choices of the opportunity zones, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe study's data on Amazon's Long Island City site shows the tract is already heavily gentrified and awash in investment. And figures from New York City's planning department list the neighborhood as the fastest-growing in the city, with more than 9,000 apartments and homes built since 2010.\n\nIn the past year, two-bedroom apartments off the Anable Basin where Amazon would move have rented for an average $4,300 a month, according to brokerage site Streeteasy. That puts it on par with rent in some buildings on the Upper East Side across the East River in Manhattan.\n\n\"That kind of opportunity zone already has lots of opportunity,\" said Brett Theodos, a research associate with Brookings' Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center.\n\nThe census tract where Amazon is moving has a poverty rate of 10 percent, half that for all of New York City, and the household income of $130,000 a year is double the city median.\n\nThat makes the area too wealthy to qualify for tax breaks on its own, but the tax law allows such areas to piggyback on nearby ones that do qualify.\n\nFor example, Amazon's Anable Basin site is just a mile from the census tract containing Queensbridge Houses, the nation's largest public housing complex, where the median household income is $14,000 and the poverty rate is nearly 50 percent.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nStephen Braun reported from Washington.", "Iran executed the so-called \"Sultan of Coins\" and his accomplice on Wednesday for hoarding gold coins and other hard currency, signaling zero tolerance as it tries to shore up its currency in the face of an economic crisis.\n\nState TV reported that Vahid Mazloumin and his accomplice, Mohammad Ismail Ghasemi, were hanged early Wednesday.

Officials are also looking to bring in mobile homes for thousands of people left homeless.\n\nDebris removal in Paradise and outlying communities will have to wait until the search for victims finishes, he said.\n\nThat grim search continued Wednesday.\n\nOn one street, ash and dust flew up as roughly 20 National Guard members wearing white jumpsuits, helmets and breathing masks lifted giant heaps of bent and burned metal, in what was left of a home. Pink and blue chalk drawings of a cat and a flower remained on the driveway, near a scorched toy truck.\n\nThe soldiers targeted homes of the missing. If anything resembling human remains is found, a coroner takes over.\n\nAfter the soldiers finished at the site, a chaplain huddled with them in prayer.\n\nThe number of missing is \"fluctuating every day\" as people are located or remains are found, said Steve Collins, a deputy with the Butte County Sheriff's Department.\n\nAuthorities on Wednesday released the names of about 100 people who are still missing, including many in their 80s and 90s, and dozens more could still be unaccounted for. Sheriff's department spokeswoman Megan McMann said the list was incomplete because detectives were concerned they would be overwhelmed with calls from relatives if the entire list were released.\n\n\"We can't release them all at once,\" McMann said. \"So they are releasing the names in batches.\"\n\nAuthorities have not updated the total number of missing since Sunday, when 228 people were unaccounted for.\n\nSol Bechtold's 75-year-old mother was not on the list. Her house burned down along with the rest of her neighborhood in Magalia, a community just north of Paradise.\n\n\"The list they published is missing a lot of names,\" said Bechtold, who's still searching shelters for his mother, a widow who lived alone and did not drive.\n\nA sheriff's deputy asked Bechtold on Wednesday for information that could identify her remains, like any history of broken bones. He told the officer she had a knee replacement. Bechtold predicted that the death toll would rise sharply.\n\n\"I feel horrible for the sheriff. I feel horrible for the people of Paradise and Magalia,\" he said. \"It's just a no-win situation unless a few hundred folks just show up out of nowhere.\"\n\nTo speed up identification of remains, officials are using portable devices that can identify genetic material in a couple of hours, rather than days or weeks.\n\nAccounts of narrow escapes from the flames continued to emerge. More than a dozen people who were trapped by a wall of fire survived by plunging into a cold lake.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday that a family of four, their 90-year-old neighbor and their pets sought safety in the chilly Concow Reservoir after the roaring fire surrounded their homes.\n\nThe family stood in shoulder-deep water as flames singed the vegetation on the shore behind them.

Associated Press writers John Antczak and Christopher Weber contributed from Los Angeles.", "Sri Lanka's Parliament passed a no-confidence vote against the government headed by the hastily sworn-in and bitterly disputed Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, as lawmakers convened Wednesday for the first time since the president dismissed his Cabinet and suspended the legislature last month.\n\nThe motion brought by the head of an opposition party could mean that Rajapaksa will have to resign his post but does not necessarily mean the leader whose ousting set off the crisis will be reinstated, creating a power vacuum in the South Asian island nation.\n\n\"Rajapaksa's government will fall,\" said Paikiasothy Sarvanamuttu, executive director of the Colombo-based nonpartisan Centre for Policy Alternatives civil society group, and among the petitioners who challenged the constitutionality of President Maithripala Sirisena's recent actions.\n\nSarvanamuttu said the no-confidence vote leaves Sirisena with two options \u2014 either to reinstate Ranil Wickremesinghe, whom he replaced with Rajapaksa on Oct. 26, as prime minister, or await the decision of the Supreme Court, which is due to issue a ruling on the ouster and subsequent government appointments on Dec. 7.\n\nLawmakers supporting Wickremesinghe had a visible majority in the chamber on Wednesday, with many wearing shawls emblazoned with the words \"For democracy.\"\n\nAs Speaker of Parliament Karu Jayasuriya prepared to let the no-confidence motion be debated, the chamber descended into chaos, with lawmakers supporting Rajapaksa filing into the center of the room shouting political slogans and accusing Jayasuriya of betraying the people's mandate.\n\nJayasuriya then said he had no choice but to bypass the debate and take an oral vote, with those in favor clearly voicing more support for the motion than those against it.\n\nBefore the results were announced, Rajapaksa walked out of the chamber.\n\nAfter it became clear last week that Rajapaksa would not survive a no-confidence motion, Sirisena dissolved Parliament, but the Supreme Court on Tuesday had ordered the legislature to keep working until next month.\n\nNamal Rajapaksa, a lawmaker in his father's United People Freedom Alliance party, told The Associated Press that they \"don't accept this verdict\" and will continue as the government.\n\nRajapaksa supporters outside Parliament shouted: \"We need a government!\"\n\nParliament adjourned after the vote and is to reconvene Thursday morning.\n\nSri Lanka's Supreme Court on Tuesday suspended Sirisena's order to dissolve Parliament and hold new elections.\n\nWickremesinghe, who has been holed up at the prime minister's official residence in Colombo since his ouster, said at a news conference after the vote that he and his supporters \"have proved that there is a purported administration which does not enjoy the support of Parliament.

It's a different technology than today's controversial \"genetically modified\" foods, more like faster breeding that promises to boost nutrition, spur crop growth, and make farm animals hardier and fruits and vegetables last longer.\n\nThe U.S. National Academy of Sciences has declared gene editing one of the breakthroughs needed to improve food production so the world can feed billions more people amid a changing climate. Yet governments are wrestling with how to regulate this powerful new tool. And after years of confusion and rancor, will shoppers accept gene-edited foods or view them as GMOs in disguise?\n\n\"If the consumer sees the benefit, I think they'll embrace the products and worry less about the technology,\" said Dan Voytas, a University of Minnesota professor and chief science officer for Calyxt Inc., which edited soybeans to make the oil heart-healthy.\n\nResearchers are pursuing more ambitious changes: Wheat with triple the usual fiber, or that's low in gluten. Mushrooms that don't brown, and better-producing tomatoes. Drought-tolerant corn, and rice that no longer absorbs soil pollution as it grows. Dairy cows that don't need to undergo painful de-horning, and pigs immune to a dangerous virus that can sweep through herds.\n\nScientists even hope gene editing eventually could save species from being wiped out by devastating diseases like citrus greening, a so far unstoppable infection that's destroying Florida's famed oranges.\n\nFirst they must find genes that could make a new generation of trees immune.\n\n\"If we can go in and edit the gene, change the DNA sequence ever so slightly by one or two letters, potentially we'd have a way to defeat this disease,\" said Fred Gmitter, a geneticist at the University of Florida Citrus Research and Education Center, as he examined diseased trees in a grove near Fort Meade.\n\nGENETICALLY MODIFIED OR EDITED, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?\n\nFarmers have long genetically manipulated crops and animals by selectively breeding to get offspring with certain traits. It's time-consuming and can bring trade-offs. Modern tomatoes, for example, are larger than their pea-sized wild ancestor, but the generations of cross-breeding made them more fragile and altered their nutrients.\n\nGMOs, or genetically modified organisms, are plants or animals that were mixed with another species' DNA to introduce a specific trait \u2014 meaning they're \"transgenic.\" Best known are corn and soybeans mixed with bacterial genes for built-in resistance to pests or weed killers.\n\nDespite international scientific consensus that GMOs are safe to eat, some people remain wary and there is concern they could spur herbicide-resistant weeds.\n\nNow gene-editing tools, with names like CRISPR and TALENs, promise to alter foods more precisely, and at less cost, without necessarily adding foreign DNA. Instead, they act like molecular scissors to alter the letters of an organism's own genetic alphabet.\n\nThe technology can insert new DNA, but most products in development so far switch off a gene, according to University of Missouri professor Nicholas Kalaitzandonakes.\n\nThose new Calyxt soybeans? Voytas' team inactivated two genes so the beans produce oil with no heart-damaging trans fat and that shares the famed health profile of olive oil without its distinct taste.\n\nThe hornless calves? Most dairy Holsteins grow horns that are removed for the safety of farmers and other cows. Recombinetics Inc. swapped part of the gene that makes dairy cows grow horns with the DNA instructions from naturally hornless Angus beef cattle.\n\n\"Precision breeding,\" is how animal geneticist Alison Van Eenennaam of the University of California, Davis, explains it. \"This isn't going to replace traditional breeding,\" but make it easier to add one more trait.\n\nRULES AREN'T CLEAR\n\nThe Agriculture Department says extra rules aren't needed for \"plants that could otherwise have been developed through traditional breeding,\" clearing the way for development of about two dozen gene-edited crops so far.\n\nIn contrast, the Food and Drug Administration in 2017 proposed tighter, drug-like restrictions on gene-edited animals. It promises guidance sometime next year on exactly how it will proceed.\n\nBecause of trade, international regulations are \"the most important factor in whether genome editing technologies are commercialized,\" USDA's Paul Spencer told a meeting of agriculture economists.\n\nEurope's highest court ruled last summer that existing European curbs on the sale of transgenic GMOs should apply to gene-edited foods, too.\n\nBut at the World Trade Organization this month, the U.S. joined 12 nations including Australia, Canada, Argentina and Brazil in urging other countries to adopt internationally consistent, science-based rules for gene-edited agriculture.\n\nARE THESE FOODS SAFE?\n\nThe biggest concern is what are called off-target edits, unintended changes to DNA that could affect a crop's nutritional value or an animal's health, said Jennifer Kuzma of the Genetic Engineering and Society Center at North Carolina State University.\n\nScientists are looking for any signs of problems. Take the hornless calves munching in a UC-Davis field. One is female and once it begins producing milk, Van Eenennaam will test how similar that milk's fat and protein composition is to milk from unaltered cows.\n\n\"We're kind of being overly cautious,\" she said, noting that if eating beef from naturally hornless Angus cattle is fine, milk from edited Holsteins should be, too.\n\nBut to Kuzma, companies will have to be up-front about how these new foods were made and the evidence that they're healthy. She wants regulators to decide case-by-case which changes are no big deal, and which might need more scrutiny.\n\n\"Most gene-edited plants and animals are probably going to be just fine to eat. But you're only going to do yourself a disservice in the long run if you hide behind the terminology,\" Kuzma said.\n\nAVOIDING A BACKLASH\n\nUncertainty about regulatory and consumer reaction is creating some strange bedfellows. An industry-backed group of food makers and farmers asked university researchers and consumer advocates to help craft guidelines for \"responsible use\" of gene editing in the food supply.\n\n\"Clearly this coalition is in existence because of some of the battle scars from the GMO debates, there's no question about that,\" said Greg Jaffe of the food-safety watchdog Center for Science in the Public Interest, who agreed to join the Center for Food Integrity's guidelines group. \"There's clearly going to be questions raised about this technology.\"\n\nSUSTAINABILITY OR HYPE?\n\nGene-editing can't do everything, cautioned Calyxt's Voytas. There are limitations to how much foods could be changed. Sure, scientists made wheat containing less gluten, but it's unlikely to ever be totally gluten-free for people who can't digest that protein, for example \u2014 or to make, say, allergy-free peanuts.\n\nNor is it clear how easily companies will be able to edit different kinds of food, key to their profit.\n\nDespite her concerns about adequate regulation, Kuzma expects about 20 gene-edited crops to hit the U.S. market over five years \u2014 and she notes that scientists also are exploring changes to crops, like cassava, that are important in the poorest countries.\n\n\"We think it's going to really revolutionize the industry,\" she said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Kelly, a retired Marine general, has been credited with bringing order and process to a chaotic West Wing, but he has fallen out of favor with the president as well as presidential daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nAyers, a seasoned campaign operative, would restore a political-mindset to the role, but he faces stiff opposition from some corners of the West Wing, with some aides lobbying Trump directly against the move.\n\nOther changes are afoot, as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke are being discussed for replacement. And in an extraordinary move Tuesday, first lady Melania Trump's office called publicly for the firing of Trump's deputy national security adviser, Mira Ricardel.\n\nFor all of the talk of churn, Trump often expresses frustration with aides and then does not take action. Talk of Kelly's exit has percolated for months and he remains in place.\n\nNielsen had hoped to complete one year in the job and leave in December, but it appeared unlikely she would last that long, said two sources. Both people who had knowledge of the debate spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nCurbing illegal immigration is Trump's signature issue \u2014 and one he returns to as a way to rally his most loyal supporters.\n\nBut anyone who takes over at Homeland Security is likely to run up against the same problems that Nielsen faced. The administration has already tried to clamp down at the border but those efforts have been largely thwarted or watered down due to legal challenges.\n\nTrump also told allies that he never fully trusted Nielsen, whom he associated with President George W. Bush, a longtime foe. And he told those close to him that he felt, at times, that her loyalty was more toward her longtime mentor \u2014 Kelly \u2014 than to the president.\n\nZinke, who faces several ethics investigations, said in interview with The Associated Press on Monday that he has spoken in recent days with Trump, Pence and Kelly about probes into his leadership and they remain supportive. He denied any wrongdoing.\n\nRoss addressed turnover rumors at a Yahoo! Finance summit Tuesday, saying he was in the post to give back to the country and support Trump.\n\n\"I worked very hard to get President Trump elected,\" he said. \"Now I'd like to work equally hard to have him succeed and be re-elected.\"\n\nQuestions about Nielsen's job security are not new. Earlier this year, she pushed back on a New York Times report that she drafted a resignation letter but did not submit it, after Trump scolded her at a Cabinet meeting.\n\nNielsen has led the sprawling post-9/11 federal agency since December. She had been chief of staff to Kelly when he was Trump's first Homeland Security secretary. A DHS spokesman would not comment on whether she was leaving.\n\n\"The secretary is honored to lead the men and women of DHS and is committed to implementing the president's security-focused agenda to protect Americans from all threats and will continue to do so,\" spokesman Tyler Houlton said.\n\nNielsen advocated for strong cybersecurity defense, and often said she believed the next terror major attack would occur online \u2014 not by planes or bombs. She was tasked with helping states secure elections following interference by Russians during the 2016 election.\n\nShe pushed Trump's immigration policies, including funding for his border wall and defended the administration's practice of separating children from parents, telling a Senate committee that removing children from parents facing criminal charges happens \"in the United States every day.\" But she was also instrumental in stopping the separations.\n\nJust last week, the administration announced that migrants would be denied asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border if they crossed illegally, creating regulations that circumvent immigration laws stating anyone can claim asylum no matter how they arrive to the country. The decision would affect about 70,000 people annually and was immediately challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nNielsen also moved to abandon longstanding regulations that dictate how long children are allowed to be held in immigration detention, and requested bed space from the U.S. military for some 12,000 people in an effort to detain all families who cross the border. Right now there is space for about 3,000 families and they are at capacity.\n\nShe got into heated discussions with Trump and White House aides several times over immigration policy, as she sought to explain the complicated legal challenges behind immigration law and pushed for a more diplomatic approach.\n\nIt's unclear who would replace her. The job requires Senate confirmation and there is no deputy secretary. Under Secretary for Management Claire Grady would be the acting head if Nielsen left.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press Writers Darlene Superville in Washington and Jonathan Lemire in New York contributed to this report.", "For more than a year, cities around the country waited in suspense over whether they'd be chosen as Amazon's second home.\n\nThe online retail giant held the promise of 50,000 jobs and the possibility of changing their fortunes. So the 20 finalists dangled tax incentives, showcased their workforce and even signed nondisclosure agreements to keep the process secret \u2014 doing whatever it would take to woo the company.\n\nIn the end, Amazon decided to go with a safe bet. On Tuesday, it announced that it had picked for its new East Coast headquarters the buzzy New York neighborhood of Long Island City, Queens as well as a suburb of Washington, in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nAmazon could have chosen a city looking to be revitalized, like Newark, New Jersey. Instead, it opted to be close to two of the nation's centers of power. Both are waterfront communities away from overcrowded business districts, giving Amazon space to grow.\n\nThe reason Amazon gave: they are best suited to attract the high-skilled workers the company wants. The two sites will each get 25,000 jobs that Amazon said will pay an average of $150,000 a year.\n\nThe company will receive more than $2 billion in tax credits and other incentives. New York is forking over more than $1.5 billion, while Virginia and Arlington are offering about a third of that \u2014 $573 million. The hope is that Amazon will attract other companies and ultimately boost the local economies. But while many see it as an opportunity, not everyone is sold on the idea.\n\n\"Offering massive corporate welfare from scarce public resources to one of the wealthiest corporations in the world at a time of great need in our state is just wrong,\" said New York State Sen. Michael Gianaris and New York City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, Democrats who represent the Long Island City area, in a joint statement.\n\nAmazon, which started as an online bookstore two decades ago, has grown to a behemoth that had nearly $180 billion in revenue last year. It now owns well-known brands, including grocer Whole Foods and online shoe-seller Zappos. It also makes movies and TV shows, runs an advertising business and offers cloud computing services to corporations and government agencies.\n\nThe company has more than 610,000 employees worldwide, making it the second largest U.S.-based, publicly-traded employer behind Walmart.\n\nBut it was the prospect of 50,000 jobs that led 238 communities across North America to pitch Amazon on why they should be home to the next headquarters.\n\nNew York is the nation's financial and media powerhouse and has been working to attract technology companies. Google already has more than 7,000 workers in the city and, according to media reports, is looking to add 12,000 more in coming years.\n\nArlington is directly across the Potomac River from Washington. Large government contractors have offices and lobbying operations there. However, many of its 1980s-era office buildings have vacancies after thousands of federal employees moved elsewhere. Being near the nation's capital could help Amazon with lobbying efforts as the company faces rising scrutiny from politicians.\n\nAmazon said it will spend $5 billion between both locations on construction and other projects.\n\nThe new outposts won't appear overnight. Amazon said hiring at the two headquarters will start next year, but it could take a decade or more to build out its offices.\n\nIts New York location will be in a neighborhood of Queens that sits directly across from midtown Manhattan. Once a bustling factory and freight-moving area, many of Long Island City's plants and warehouses closed as manufacturing left New York. The empty warehouses drew artists looking for affordable rents and businesses followed. Today, the neighborhood is made up of expensive, high-rise condos, with many more under construction.\n\nAmazon's Virginia offices will be in a part of Arlington that local politicians and Amazon are calling National Landing, an area around Reagan National Airport that encompasses Crystal City and Potomac Yard. Large parts are made up of vacant '70s and '80s-era office buildings. Among other challenges, Crystal City has fought to overcome a reputation for outdated architecture.\n\nVirginia state Sen. Adam Ebbin, a Democrat who represents the area where Amazon's new headquarters will be located, said that affordable housing may become an issue, but the announcement is a welcome development that will help increase the area's tax base to help ease overcrowding in schools and address other pressing needs.\n\n\"I would say it's a double-edged sword,\" said Margo Williams, who lives in nearby Alexandria, Virginia. She said more workers in the area would increase tax revenues and bring better services for the community, but she worries traffic could get worse and the Metro more crowded.\n\nAmazon said it will refer to the new locations as headquarters, even though with 25,000 jobs each, they would have fewer workers than its Seattle hometown , which houses more than 45,000 employees.\n\nSeattle will remain one of Amazon's three headquarters, and the company said that senior executives will also be based in the two new locations. It plans to hold company-wide events at the new locations, including shareholder meetings.\n\nThere were early signs that Amazon had its sights set on New York and northern Virginia. Among its 20 finalists, the company had selected two locations in the New York metro area and three in the D.C. area. Plus, CEO and founder Jeff Bezos has a home in Washington D.C., and he personally owns The Washington Post newspaper.\n\nWhile it didn't win the main prize, Nashville, Tennessee, won't go empty handed. Amazon said the finalist city will be home to a new Amazon office with 5,000 jobs, focused on customer delivery and supply chain. Those jobs will also be paid an average of $150,000 a year, Amazon said.\n\n\"You know, this is a huge win,\" said Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam. \"When we got this news, I think all of us were really, really excited about it.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAlan Suderman in Richmond, Virginia, Matthew Barakat in Arlington County, Virginia, Jonathan Mattise in Nashville, Tennessee, and Karen Matthews in New York contributed to this report.", "There was a loud bang, and suddenly the Southwest Airlines jet rolled sharply to the left. Smoke began to fill the cabin, and flight attendants rushed row by row to make sure all passengers could get oxygen from their masks.\n\nWhen flight attendant Rachel Fernheimer got to row 14, she saw a woman strapped in her lap belt but with her head, torso and arm hanging out a broken window.\n\nFernheimer grabbed one of the woman's legs while flight attendant Seanique Mallory grabbed her lower body. They described being unable to bring the woman back in the plane until two male passengers stepped in to help.\n\nThe harrowing details from the April 17 fatal flight were released for the first time as the National Transportation Safety Board began a hearing Wednesday into the engine failure on Southwest Flight 1380, which carried 144 passengers and five crew members.\n\nThe flight attendants told investigators at least one of the male passengers put his arm out of the window and wrapped it around the woman's shoulder to help pull her back in. Fernheimer said when she looked out the window, she could see that one of the plane's engines was shattered, and there was blood on the outside of the aircraft.\n\nFlight attendants asked for medical volunteers. A paramedic laid the woman across a row of seats and began chest compressions. They tried a defibrillator but it indicated that there was no shock. The paramedic and a nurse took turns at CPR.\n\nPassengers asked if they were going to die. Fernheimer said she squeezed their hands. \"She told them that they were going to make it,\" an investigator wrote.\n\nPilots Tammie Jo Shults and Darren Ellisor landed the crippled Boeing 737 in Philadelphia. The passenger in the window seat, Jennifer Riordan, was fatally injured \u2014 the first death on a U.S. airline flight since 2009. Eight other passengers, including at least one of the men who helped pull Riordan back in the window, suffered minor injuries.\n\nWednesday's hearing in Washington focused on design and inspection of fan blades on the engine, made by CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France's Safran S.A.\n\nAn official from CFM defended the design and testing of fan blades like the one that snapped on the Southwest plane as it flew high above Pennsylvania, triggering an engine breakup that flung debris like shrapnel into the plane.\n\nAfter the fatal accident, CFM recommended the use of frequent and more sophisticated tests using ultrasound or electrical currents.\n\nAnother Southwest jet had suffered a similar blade-related engine breakup in 2016 over Florida.\n\nCFM and federal regulators considered the Florida incident an aberration.\n\n\"We determined early that we would require some corrective action in that it was an unsafe condition,\" an FAA expert on engines, Christopher Spinney, testified on Wednesday, \"but we also determined we had some time.\"\n\nRather than order immediate inspections of fan blades after the 2016 incident, the FAA began a slower process for drafting a regulation and getting public comment before enacting it. That process was still underway when the fatal accident occurred nearly two years later.\n\nSince the deadly flight, widespread inspections have turned up eight other fan blades on similar CFM engines that also had cracks. The fan blade that broke was last inspected six years earlier and, it was determined, suffered from metal fatigue even then \u2014 but it went unnoticed by a less sophisticated exam used at the time.\n\nFan blades have been thought to have no real lifetime limit. CFM and FAA officials said they were now considering whether blades must be replaced at some point even if they don't show wear.\n\nRepresentatives from CFM also testified about testing and certification of jet engines, which are supposed to be built to prevent pieces from breaking off and flying free.\n\nThe investigation is continuing. Most of Wednesday's hearing was highly technical. It was led by one of the safety board's five members, Bella Dinh-Zarr. The full board is expected to determine a probable cause for the accident in the next several months.\n\nMeanwhile, Riordan's husband, Michael, said in a statement on behalf of his family that they were \"grateful for the heroic actions of the passengers who tried to save Jennifer's life.\"\n\n\"The most important thing now is making sure that the aircraft and engine failures that caused Jennifer's untimely and unnecessary death never happen again,\" he said.", "The agency for K-pop superstars BTS apologized Wednesday for members wearing a T-shirt depicting the explosion of an atomic bomb and a hat with a Nazi emblem.\n\nJapanese TV broadcasters recently canceled or stopped discussions on appearances in that country after images went viral of the musician wearing the shirt. The South Korean boy band ran into more troubles after news broke out that another member wore a hat featuring a Nazi symbol in a magazine photo book and band members flew flags with what appeared to be the Nazi swastika during a concert in the past.\n\n\"We would like to again offer our sincerest apologies to anyone who has suffered pain, distress and discomfort due to our shortcomings and oversight in ensuring that these matters receive our most careful attention,\" the band's agency, the Big Hit Entertainment, said in a statement.\n\nThe T-shirt portrayed an atomic bombing juxtaposed with the celebration of Korea's 1945 liberation from Japan at the end of the World War II. The United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki before Tokyo's surrender.\n\nBefore its division into North and South Korea after the liberation, the Korean Peninsula was colonized by Japan from 1910-1945. Many in both Koreas still harbor strong resentment against the Japanese colonial masters. But in South Korea, it's extremely rare for anyone to publicly celebrate or mock the atomic bombings. The atomic bombings killed more than 200,000 people in Japan. A South Korean government estimate says about 40,000 of the dead were Koreans, while a victims' group put the Korean death toll at 50,000, many forcefully mobilized as laborers by Japan.\n\nSouth Korean politicians criticized the Japanese broadcasters' decisions to cancel BTS appearances, accusing Japan of harboring \"self-centered views on history\" and letting politics interfere with cultural exchanges.\n\nIt doesn't appear the T-shirt controversy is seriously affecting the band's huge popularity in Japan, with 50,000 people reportedly filling up the Tokyo Dome to watch their performance Wednesday evening after a similar reception on Tuesday.\n\nThe BTS agency said the A-bomb shirt's wearing was \"in no way intentional\" and that it wasn't designed to \"injure or make light of those affected by the use of atomic weapons.\" It said it still apologizes for \"failing to take the precautions that could have prevented the wearing of such clothing by our artist.\"\n\nRegarding the hat furor, it said all apparel and accessories used for the photo book were provided by a media company involved in its publication. It said the flags in question were aimed at symbolizing South Korea's restrictively uniform and authoritarian educational systems, not the Nazism.\n\n\"We will carefully examine and review not only these issues but all activities involving Big Hit and our artists based on a firm understanding of diverse social, historical and cultural considerations to ensure that we never cause any injury, pain or distress to anyone,\" the agency statement said.\n\nThe seven members of the band, which has a worldwide following, in May became the first South Korean artists to top the Billboard 200 albums chart with \"Love Yourself: Tear.\" The band began its Japan tour earlier this week.\n\nSouth Korean K-pop and movie stars are extremely popular in Japan and other Asian countries.", "When the Miss Universe beauty pageant takes place in a few weeks, Chile will be represented by a slender brunette who has a killer smile and speaks Spanish with an unmistakable Venezuelan accent.\n\nAndrea Diaz was born and raised in Valencia, Venezuela, where from the age of 12 she learned to sway her hips and glide gracefully down catwalks at a local modeling academy. At 19, she won a pageant organized by her hometown's baseball team and became a goodwill ambassador for the squad.\n\nBut Diaz's career changed course in her twenties as she moved to Panama and then Mexico for modeling jobs, which are now scarce in crisis-wracked Venezuela. Three years ago she settled down in Chile, where most of her family has also relocated.\n\n\"I represent the new Chile,\" the 26-year-old said as she was training at a local gym in Santiago for the upcoming competition. \"This is an inclusive country where immigrants come in search of opportunities.\"\n\nAs thousands of people leave Venezuela each day to escape food shortages and an inflation rate that is expected to surpass 1 million percent, dozens of would-be beauty queens are also taking flight and finding work as models and media personalities overseas.\n\nSome are even representing their adopted homelands in international beauty pageants.\n\nNext month, Portugal will be represented at the Miss World competition in China by a former Miss Venezuela participant. And the recently concluded Miss Earth Contest, held in the Philippines, featured two Venezuelan models who competed on behalf of Peru and Spain.\n\n\"My dream of being a beauty queen was not going to stop just because I arrived in a new country,\" said Jessica Russo, who represented Peru in Miss Earth, just a year after moving to that country.\n\nShe failed to make it into the finals but said she will now train for more pageants, where she hopes to win a crown for Peru, the country where her mother was born.\n\n\"I'm still young,\" said the 22-year-old. \"And I want to be a global spokeswoman for good causes.\"\n\nBeauty pageants are followed almost as closely as baseball in Venezuela, which has long been obsessed with glamour and good looks. The South American country is a world leader in international pageants, with seven Miss Universe crowns and six Miss World titles.\n\nWhile critics have described the pageants as misogynous and antiquated, they are defended by many Venezuelans who say the events have helped hundreds of women from all social classes launch careers as models, actresses, TV hosts and news presenters. One former Miss Venezuela winner even served as a mayor of a district in Caracas and ran \u2014 unsuccessfully \u2014 for the country's presidency.\n\nBut as Venezuela's economy plunges, the country's many pageants no longer offer a direct path to employment. Live fashion shows have ground to a halt, TV productions have slowed down and companies such as fashion brands increasingly refrain from spending money on advertisements.\n\nGiselle Reyes runs four modeling schools for young women in Venezuela that she touts as the \"university of beauty.\" She estimates around 70 percent of her graduates have left the country over the past decade to seek modeling jobs in Mexico, Colombia, the United States and other countries.\n\n\"I even have a tough time finding modeling instructors now,\" Reyes said at a studio in Caracas that is lined with photos of celebrity Venezuelan pageant winners. \"People always tell me they will work for me for a few months while they find a way to leave the country.\"\n\nEven Venezuela's most competitive beauty pageant no longer seems to guarantee its graduates a job in their own country.\n\nThe nationally televised Miss Venezuela contest chooses 24 participants each year and puts them through a grueling six-month academy that includes daily gym routines, modeling lessons and pep talks from instructors who sometimes coax their pupils into having plastic surgery.\n\nBut at least 17 members of the Miss Venezuela class of 2015 appear to be working abroad in Mexico, Colombia, Turkey and even as far away as India, according to a web search of their social media profiles. The number of 2014 contestants working overseas is similar.\n\n\"In the '90s, participating in Miss Venezuela virtually guaranteed you work in modeling or in TV,\" said Rafael Briceno, a Caracas-based radio host who has given public speaking classes to dozens of Miss Venezuela participants. \"Now the local market for models is very small.\"\n\nMany of the Venezuelan beauty queens who have gone abroad credit their rigid preparation in Venezuela with helping them to succeed. But they also are relieved to be free of the demanding, cookie-cutter beauty standards imposed by pageant organizers at home.\n\nDiaz said that while she was still living in Venezuela, she went to a skin cleansing session that went wrong and left small scars and reddish blotches on both her cheeks. Modeling agencies in Venezuela then started to reject her.\n\nIn Chile, Diaz was able to win the national beauty contest despite the rashes, which can be easily hidden with makeup. She was able to participate because her father is Chilean.\n\n\"Chile accepted me as I am and helped me to regain the confidence I had lost,\" Diaz said.\n\nNow, as she readies for the Miss Universe pageant next month in Thailand, the model hopes that the jury doesn't just focus on her physical attributes but sees her as a cosmopolitan woman who has moved around the world in pursuit of her goals. She says that she dreams of becoming a motivational speaker working with youth on self-esteem issues.\n\n\"A beautiful woman is not just a woman with perfect skin,\" Diaz said, \"but someone with a heart, with ideas and a sense of purpose.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Manuel Rueda reported from Bogota, Colombia, and AP writer Eva Vergara reported in Santiago, Chile.

That was so hard.\" She said she didn't mention that episode in her book.\n\nShe didn't criticize Trump directly at the event despite direct criticism of him in her book.\n\nShe writes in \"Becoming\" that Trump's \"loud and reckless innuendos\" about her husband's birth certificate stirred people up and put \"my family's safety at risk.\" And for this,\" she adds, \"I'd never forgive him.\"\n\nTrump responded last week, saying Michelle Obama \"got paid a lot of money\" to write that book and they always expect a little controversy.\" The current president said that he'd never forgive his predecessor for making the country \"very unsafe.\"\n\nWhen Winfrey, who selected \"Becoming\" for her influential book club , introduced Obama she referred to the divisive political climate, also without directly naming Trump.\n\n\"So many people are feeling uneasy... afraid of the impending darkness,\" Winfrey told the audience. \"But you all being here tonight is a testament to the light.\"\n\n\"Becoming\" describes Obama's upbringing on Chicago's South Side and her transition to college at Princeton University. As she does in her book, she recounted Tuesday being raised in a family that struggled economically \u2014 but with parents who encouraged her to be successful.\n\nWhen she was a child, she said her dad would complain to her mother that she wasn't teaching her children how to wash socks, because he had had so few socks growing up that he had to wash them and dry them on a radiator himself.\n\n\"My mom said, 'I'm not teaching them how to wash their socks. I'm going to teach them to go to college, so they can buy a washing machine,'\" Obama said Tuesday.\n\nShe also talked about learning how to play the piano on a rickety one and her surprise at seeing her first piano that was in good condition.\n\n\"You mean there are perfect pianos out there?\" she recalled thinking. \"I didn't even know about it.\"\n\nThe memoir, officially released Tuesday, is already a best-seller. It topped Amazon.com's best-seller list throughout the weekend.\n\nThe tour that started in Chicago moves on to Los Angles, Washington, Detroit, Paris and London, and other U.S. cities. It ends next month in New York City.\n\nTens of thousands of people purchased tickets to Obama's United Center appearance \u2014 paying from just under $30 to hundreds or even thousands of dollars for VIP packages. No tickets are available online for some stops.\n\nAlthough some fans have complained about the high cost, 10 percent of tickets costs are being donated to local charities, schools and community groups.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP Writer Jeff Karoub in Detroit also contributed.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Michael Tarm on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mtarm", "The Japanese economy shrank at an annualized rate of 1.2 percent in July-September, as consumer spending, investment and exports fell, according to government data released Wednesday.\n\nCabinet Office preliminary data showed seasonally adjusted gross domestic product \u2014 the total value of a nation's goods and services \u2014 dipped 0.3 percent in the third quarter from the previous quarter.\n\nDragging on growth for the world's third-largest economy was diminished trade, with exports falling 1.8 percent and imports dropping 1.4 percent, the data show. Consumer spending and company investments were also down.\n\nThe economy grew for the previous April-June quarter, but contracted the quarter before that. That contraction, in the first quarter, ended the longest straight period of expansion for Japan in nearly three decades.\n\nHarumi Taguchi, chief economist at HIS Markit in Tokyo, said natural disasters during the third quarter had weighed on consumer travel and spending, which meant growth could recover if such disasters don't happen during the year's final quarter.\n\nThe closure of a major airport in the western Kansai area after a typhoon was one of the natural disasters that brought down growth, he said. A major earthquake also hit the northernmost island of Hokkaido during the quarter, causing fatal landslides and widespread blackouts.\n\nUntil recently, Japan has been keeping up moderate growth under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's \"Abenomics\" policies based on a deflation-fighting stimulus program of cheap lending.\n\nBut other factors are hurting the economy, such as the nation's continuing labor shortage and slow wage growth.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nYuri Kageyama is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nOn Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en", "Leaders of Southeast Asian nations have again pushed back an agreement on a pan-Asian free trade deal amid a whirlwind of diplomacy Wednesday at their annual summit.\n\nIn convening talks among the leaders of countries participating in the plan, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said a final agreement on the deal, which is expected to encompass nearly half the world's population and 40 percent of world trade, will be delayed until 2019.\n\nLee's comments confirmed earlier expectations that the 16 countries in the plan, called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, would not meet their goal of finalizing the accord this year.\n\nThe trade talks followed scores of bilateral meetings among the leaders and talks on other issues such as regional security, how to keep peace in the South China Sea and the crisis over hundreds of thousands of ethnic Rohingya Muslims who have fled to Bangladesh to escape violence in Myanmar.\n\nDuring the meetings in Singapore, Lee has championed the region's commitment to free trade and a multilateral approach to sorting out the issue \u2014 in contrast with U.S. President Donald Trump's \"American First\" preference for bilateral trade deals and distrust of international institutions.\n\n\"We are meeting at a critical time. Protectionism and anti-globalization sentiments are on the rise. This can have a devastating impact on the regional as well as the global economy, and business confidence in Asia is already being affected,\" Lee said.\n\n\"It's important that we redouble our economic integration efforts and maintain a free, open and rules-based multilateral trading system which has underpinned our growth and prosperity,\" he said.\n\nTrump withdrew from a Pacific Rim trade initiative, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, just after taking office last year. That trade pact is due to take effect on Dec. 30. The U.S. is not part of the RCEP initiative, which includes China, India, Australia and most other Asian economies.\n\nLee said participating countries had finished seven of 18 chapters in their agreement and shown \"strong political will\" to finish it. He warned that further delays in reaching an agreement, already in negotiations for six years, would damage the RCEP's credibility.\n\n\"We are now at the final stage of negotiations. With a strong momentum generated this year, I am pleased to note that the RCEP negotiations are poised for conclusion in 2019,\" he said.\n\nThe 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations members are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Earlier Wednesday, the ASEAN leaders met with their counterparts from Australia, China, South Korea, Russia and Japan.\n\nManaging conflict in the South China Sea is a perennial concern. China is pitted against its smaller neighbors in multiple disputes in the sea over coral reefs and lagoons in waters crucial for global commerce and rich in fish and potential oil and gas reserves.\n\nWhile in Singapore, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has sought to reassure China's neighbors.\n\n\"We have found the way to properly manage and defuse differences, for example, on the issue of the South China Sea in the past years,\" Li said, adding that the situation was moving toward \"greater stability\" with progress toward a single draft text on a code of conduct in the sea. He reiterated Beijing's hope to have a final agreement within three years.\n\nPhilippine President Rodrigo Duterte said such a code is needed \"at all cost\" to prevent dangerous miscalculations.\n\nThe Philippines softened its earlier harsh criticism of China's assertive moves in the disputed waters after Duterte sought to repair relations with Beijing once he took office in 2016 and sought infrastructure funding, trade and investment from Beijing.\n\nThe region already has a nonbinding \"Declaration of Conduct\" but is working toward a more robust agreement, with China appearing to win support for its calls to ban involvement by outside powers, such as the United States, in maritime disputes.\n\nDuterte cited a risk of \"serious miscalculation\" and potential clashes that could trigger military action based on mutual defense treaties.\n\n\"So you are there, so you are in possession, you have occupied it, but tell us what route we should take, what kind of behavior,\" he said.\n\n\"Everything's been excellent between China and the rest of ASEAN except for the fact that there's friction between the Western nations and China,\" Duterte told reporters as he headed into meetings.\n\nWhile the Singapore meetings were typically focused on cooperation and goodwill, concerns over Myanmar's treatment of its ethnic Rohingya Muslims flared with unusually sharp comments to the country's leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence told Suu Kyi on Wednesday that the situation was inexcusable. He also took aim at Myanmar's arrest and imprisonment of two Reuters journalists.\n\nOn Tuesday, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed lambasted Suu Kyi for her handling of the crisis that led to mass killings and the exodus of more than 700,000 Rohingya from Buddhist-majority Myanmar since August 2017.\n\nMahathir, whose own country has a Muslim majority, said he told Suu Kyi that as a former political detainee, she should show more compassion.\n\n\"They are actually oppressing these people to the point of, well, killing them, mass killing, and burial in graves dug by the victims and that kind of thing,\" said Mahathir, a 93-year-old political veteran whose own past treatment of dissidents at times drew opprobrium. \"That may be relevant in ancient times, but in modern days, we don't do that kind of thing.\"", "The man who first seized power in a military coup then refashioned himself as a legitimate leader appears set to rule Fiji for another four years.\n\nPrime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama and his FijiFirst party were headed for a convincing election win early Thursday as votes were tallied. Bainimarama has ruled the island nation since his 2006 coup, and won his first election in 2014 after returning democracy to the country.\n\nWith about half of the votes counted, FijiFirst was ahead with 53 percent while closest rival the Social Democratic Liberal Party, led by Sitiveni Rabuka, was at 37 percent. The margin was closer than in the last election, when FijiFirst won almost 60 percent of the vote.\n\nRabuka led two military coups in the 1980s before serving seven years as prime minister in the 1990s. Just this week, a judge cleared him of an electoral disclosure violation in a case that many viewed as being politically motivated.\n\nHeavy rainfall throughout Wednesday affected voter turnout. The bad weather prompted officials to close more than 20 polling venues, affecting more than 7,000 voters who were promised the chance to vote at a later date.\n\nBefore voting ended, Supervisor of Elections Mohammed Saneem urged voters to brave the weather, saying low turnout needed \"to increase as much as possible.\"\n\n\"The weather is a bit discouraging,\" said Akanisi Lal. That didn't stop the 53-year-old from taking a break from looking after her family to vote for Bainimarama.\n\n\"I have seen what he has been doing over the past four years,\" she said, citing policies such as free bus fares for seniors. \"He will go deeper if he comes again in power.\"\n\nSome voters were reluctant to say who they voted for because of fear of reprisals. \"I don't want to be victimized,\" said Jashneel Kumar, a 24-year-old nurse.\n\nFiji has not allowed the political tensions to take a toll on its vital tourism industry, which promotes the Pacific nation's pristine, sunny beaches and friendly, welcoming people.\n\nGiven the history of coups, political stability was a big issue leading up to the election, as were racial tensions and economic issues.\n\nMany people in the nation of 920,000 seem appreciative of the economic gains they've made under Bainimarama.\n\n\"There are no school fees. Before, I paid a couple hundred for school fees,\" said Mere Rigamoto, a 42-year-old mother of three boys. \"Bainimarama's government is not bad. He's OK.\"\n\nBut Bainimarama has a troubled political history that has contributed to the coup culture. There were rumors he could stage another coup should he lose the election.\n\n\"We're bound to have another coup if he doesn't win,\" said 30-year-old Robert Lum On, a recent university graduate.\n\nFiji became independent from the U.K. in 1970. In 1987, Rabuka staged two racially charged coups to return the country to the hands of indigenous Fijians, who make up about 57 percent of the population, and away from Fijians of Indian descent, who make up 38 percent.\n\nIndo-Fijians have been a major ethnic group in Fiji since colonial times, when the British brought them in to work the sugar cane plantations. Many Indo-Fijians favor Bainimarama, whose new constitution in 2013 removed race quotas from Parliament.\n\n\"Bainimarama's key success has been to establish the name 'Fijian' for all citizens of Fiji,\" said Richard Herr, a professor at Fiji National University who is based in Australia. \"His legislation has made campaigning on race, or even having a racially based party, illegal.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, Bainimarama accused Rabuka of stoking the flames of racism that continue to divide the nation. But some indigenous Fijians believed Rabuka would help restore their prestige, and liked his promise to bring back the nation's Great Council of Chiefs, which Bainimarama disbanded.\n\nCritics deride Bainimarama as authoritarian, but since forcing himself into power, he has changed his image into that of a stable, legitimate leader. His appeal was bolstered when he assumed the U.N. COP23 presidency in November 2017. In that role, which he holds until December, he shaped Fiji into a pioneer on climate change issues.\n\nWith COP23 as a platform, Fiji inserted small island developing states into the international conversation on climate change. The islands are on the front lines of global warming, rising sea levels and ocean acidification.\n\nAfter the 2006 coup, Australia and New Zealand imposed sanctions on Fiji, and Bainimarama reoriented regional alliances toward China. His critics accuse him of selling out the country to the Chinese.\n\nThe Lowy Institute says Fiji received about $360 million in aid from China between 2006 and 2016, putting it behind only Papua New Guinea in the Pacific region. China Exim Bank holds 39 percent of Fiji's externally held public debt, according to The Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nFiji's relations have since normalized with Australia and New Zealand, but the period of sanctions enabled China to step up its regional influence.\n\nFiji has one of the healthiest economies of the Pacific Islands, and GDP is predicted to grow above 3 percent annually through 2020. Tourism is the bedrock of the economy, accounting for more than 40 percent of GDP.\n\nBainimarama's government takes credit for increasing social services, including free primary and secondary education, free bus fares for seniors, and aid in the aftermath of cyclones. But widespread poverty persists. Bainimarama's opponents vowed to raise the minimum wage, which remains only about $1.25 per hour.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Nick Perry in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report.", "Regional security and the strengthening of ties with Japan and the U.S. will be high on the agenda for Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison when he meets leaders from both countries amid continuing concerns about the growing influence of China in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nMorrison will meet Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday, when Abe makes a flying visit to Darwin between a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Singapore and the weekend's meeting of leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in Papua New Guinea. Abe will become the first Japanese leader to visit Darwin since the bombing of the northern Australian city by Japanese forces in World War II.\n\nMorrison will then hold meetings with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence during the APEC meeting in Port Moresby. Pence will use the northern Australian city of Cairns as his base for those meetings amid concerns over security in Papua New Guinea. It's expected several other APEC leaders will also stay in Cairns.\n\nTrade and investment will be a major focus of Morrison's meetings with Abe, who will use his Darwin trip to also visit Japan's biggest ever foreign investment, the $40 billion Ichthys gas project in which Japanese firm Inpex is the majority shareholder and operator. The project, which pipes offshore gas from the northwest Australian coast to Darwin, began its first shipments of liquefied natural gas to Japan last month.\n\nMorrison said he and Abe would also acknowledge those who served in World War II, in a pointed gesture in the northern port city that was bombed by Japanese forces in 1942, with the loss of 250 lives.\n\n\"Prime Minister Abe's visit is deeply symbolic and significant and it will build on our two countries' strong and enduring friendship as well as our economic, security, community and historical ties,\" Morrison said in a statement.\n\nThe meeting comes at a time when a key topic for Australia, its second-largest trading partner Japan and other Asian and South Pacific neighbors is how to respond to the growing influence of China, Australia's biggest trading partner.\n\nAustralia and Japan are expected to reach agreement in Darwin to facilitate larger and more regular joint military exercises, part of a strengthening of defense and economic ties amid growing uncertainty about American involvement in Asia under the Trump administration.\n\nNegotiations began in 2014 for the Reciprocal Access Agreement, which would make it easier for Japanese and Australian forces to visit either country with equipment for military exercises.\n\nAn official from Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Australian Financial Review newspaper this week that the two countries were \"at the final stage in discussions\" on the agreement, set to become the first pact on visiting forces Tokyo has signed outside of its arrangement with the U.S.\n\nJapan is also expected to welcome Australia's new foreign policy shift toward the southwest Pacific announced last week. Canberra will set up a 2 billion Australian dollar ($1.4 billion) fund to support infrastructure projects in the region, which fits with Japan's call for alternative sources of investment to China's Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nMorrison will also meet Pence in Port Moresby, where the vice president is expected to deliver a speech at the APEC CEO Summit on Saturday morning continuing Washington's push against China's growing influence. Pence is due to talk just minutes after an address to the forum by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Morrison will also address the gathering\n\nAs the U.S. trade war with China continues, Pence is expected to maintain a hard line against Beijing, following a speech he delivered last month accusing China of stealing U.S. intellectual property, meddling in American elections and suppressing human rights.\n\nPence is also expected to increase pressure on China over its militarization of the disputed South China Sea, the need to maintain pressure on North Korea to denuclearize and on the fight against terrorism.\n\nPence's press secretary Alyssa Farah said he would \"deliver the message that authoritarianism, aggression, and the disregard for other nations' sovereignty by any nation in the Indo-Pacific will not be tolerated by the United States.\"\n\nThe vice president is also expected to set out Washington's rival vision for the Indo-Pacific, promoting private investment over state-controlled funding to build regional infrastructure, in reaction to Chinese involvement in the South Pacific in recent years.\n\nIn an opinion piece for the Washington Post last weekend, Pence wrote: \"The United States will work with like-minded nations \u2014 from India to the Pacific islands \u2014 to advance our shared interests. Together, we will stand up to anyone who threatens our interests and our values. The United States seeks collaboration, not control.\"\n\nAustralia will show off a heavy military presence around the APEC meeting to maintain security including a helicopter-landing ship, fighter jets and 500 troops to be stationed in Port Moresby.\n\nThe U.S., Japan, China, Canada, New Zealand and Indonesia are also contributing to security arrangements.", "Battles in the courtroom and protests at the state capitol underscore the bitter turmoil plaguing Georgia's gubernatorial election.\n\nLegal victories have buoyed Stacey Abrams' campaign efforts and there is a belief now that enough outstanding ballots exist to force a one-on-one runoff against Republican Brian Kemp.\n\nKemp resigned from his post as the state's secretary of state last week after he and his party declared victory over Abrams.

Three more people were charged with conspiracy but did not appear.\n\nThe suspects were arrested last week in a police raid and charged under a law that specifically targets surrogacy, which was outlawed in 2016 after Cambodia became a popular destination for foreigners seeking women to give birth to their children.\n\nActing as an intermediary between an adoptive parent and a pregnant woman carries a penalty of one to six months in prison. The human trafficking offense is punishable by seven to 15 years' imprisonment.\n\nDeveloping countries are popular for surrogacy because costs are much lower than in countries such as the United States and Australia, where surrogate services can cost around $150,000. The surrogacy business boomed in Cambodia after it was put under tight restrictions in neighboring Thailand. There also were crackdowns in India and Nepal. After Cambodia's crackdown, the trade shifted to neighboring Laos.\n\nIn early July, 33 pregnant Cambodian women hired to act as surrogate mothers were formally charged with surrogacy and human trafficking offenses, as were a Chinese man and four Cambodian women accused of managing the business.\n\nIn July last year, a Cambodian court sentenced an Australian woman and two Cambodian associates to 1 1/2 years in prison for providing commercial surrogacy services.", "The Latest on Indonesian fishermen accused of trying to smuggle shark fins (all times local):\n\n3:30 p.m.\n\nA U.S. judge is allowing 10 Indonesian fishermen arrested in Hawaii to be released while a case accusing them of trying to smuggle sharks fins is pending.\n\nAccording to court documents, they had been working on a Japanese boat and were headed home via Honolulu when airport security workers found shark fins in their luggage.\n\nCourt documents say there were at least 962 shark fins in 13 pieces of luggage.

His factory churns out tons of cookies, crackers, candies and bakery goods, plus dozens of varieties of soft drinks sold around the country. In its showroom, Kwon Yong Chol proudly showed off one of his best-sellers, a nutrient soup made with spirulina, a blue-green microalgae \"superfood.\"\n\n\"Ever since construction began everyone here had wanted the leader to visit, and this year he did. His visit was the biggest thing that could happen to us,\" Kwon, smiling broadly, said of Kim Jong Un's visit in July. \"He ate our instant noodles. He said they were delicious.\"\n\nNot all managers have been so fortunate.\n\nThere's a lot on the line for North Korea these days. And Kim means business.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThough the international spotlight has been on his denuclearization talks with Washington, the North Korean leader has a lot riding domestically on his promises to boost the country's economy and standard of living. His announcement in April that North Korea had sufficiently developed its nuclear weapons and would now focus on building its economy marked a sharp turn in official policy, setting the stage for his rapid-fire meetings with the leaders of China, South Korea and the United States.\n\nIt also set in motion an ambitious campaign of \"on-the-spot guidance\" trips to rally party officials, factory managers and military troops.\n\nAfter the announcement of the \"new strategic line\" and his first round of summits, including his meeting in June with President Donald Trump, Kim embarked on nearly 20 inspection tours around the country in July and another 10 in August, all but one of them to non-military locations. The military inspection rounds are instead being handled by the country's premier, Pak Pong Ju, who has gone on 18 inspection tours from July, mostly to military facilities.\n\nOn-the-spot guidance tours are a tradition Kim inherited from his father and grandfather, the late \"eternal General-Secretary\" Kim Jong Il and \"eternal President\" Kim Il Sung.\n\nThey date to the late 1940s, when Kim Il Sung began gradually institutionalizing the visits to demonstrate his hands-on leadership and, as invariably portrayed by the North's media, his deep care and concern for the well-being of the people.\n\nFactories, farms and important industrial facilities are the usual destinations. But Kim Jong Un's focus on them this year marks a break from excursions in 2017 to nuclear weapons facilities and missile sites.\n\nReflecting the gravity of his current mission, Kim has shown little patience for cadres who come up short.\n\nOn his July tour in the northern part of the country he lambasted officials at a factory that produces backpacks for students, saying their attitude was \"very wrong\" and \"has no revolutionary spirit.\" He then dressed down officials at a power plant that has been under construction for 17 years, criticized people in charge of a hotel project for taking too long to finish plastering its walls and slammed the authorities responsible for building a recreational campsite.\n\n\"Looking round the bathroom of the camp, he pointed out its very bad condition, saying bathtubs for hot spring therapy are dirty, gloomy and unsanitary for their poor management,\" said an official report of the visit.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMost inspection tours, however, go like Kim's two-hour visit to the Songdowon processed foods factory.\n\nWith a gaggle of cameramen in tow \u2014 the tours are always top news in North Korea's media \u2014 the site's senior manager generally serves as the guide. Members of Kim's entourage frantically take notes as he suggests tweaks of this or that and offers praise or encouragement.\n\nMany factories put up red and gold plaques to commemorate the event. Some have special wall displays made afterward that show the exact path the leader took in little LED lights that can be turned on at the press of a button.\n\nAt Kwon's factory, which has 300 employees and is located on the outskirts of the eastern coastal city of Wonsan, Kim advised managers to improve operations on an \"automated, unmanned and germ-free basis, holding aloft the banner of self-reliance.\"\n\nBefore the obligatory group photo session, the North's official news agency reported, Kim voiced \"his expectation and conviction\" the factory would produce more quality foods \"and thus more fully demonstrate the honor of being a factory loved by the people.\"\n\nBut Kim also had a broader point to make.\n\nHe told the factory management that they must be prepared to work in a more competitive environment, to modernize and cut the fat. These are special times and they, and basically all managers throughout the country, need to step up their game.\n\n\"The Respected Marshal Kim Jong Un pays much more attention to the quality of a product,\" Kwon said. \"When he came to this factory he gave instructions to maintain a high level of hygiene because food is closely associated with the health of the people, and to keep the highest level of quality of products that people like. He said we must produce products that are world class, and produce a lot of foods that people like.\"\n\nKwon said the pressure isn't just coming from above.\n\n\"The people demand more quality,\" he said. \"When people look at the product, they must feel like they want to have it. So we are designing things in line with that. We have to satisfy the demands of the people.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTalmadge is the AP's Pyongyang bureau chief.

After several more explosions, the mine was sealed shut.\n\nNew Zealand's previous conservative government concluded the mine remained too unsafe to re-enter. But after winning power a year ago, liberal Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern promised her government would re-examine the issue.\n\n\"To the Pike River families, to New Zealand: We are returning,\" said Little.\n\nAnna Osborne, whose husband Milton Osborne was killed in the explosion, said it was a victory for the \"little people\" of New Zealand. She said that for the men who were killed, the families couldn't just let things lie.\n\n\"We needed to fight,\" she told media on Wednesday. \"We need to bring our men home if we can. We need answers to questions that we don't have. We need the unexplored crime scene investigated. And that's what's going to happen.\"\n\nDinghy Pattinson, the chief operating officer for the Pike River Recovery Agency, told The Associated Press that the mine remains filled with about 96 percent methane gas.\n\nHe said the plan is to add some bore holes and gradually pump in nitrogen gas to replace the methane as it rises and dissipates into the atmosphere. The nitrogen will then be replaced by air before crews can safely re-enter the mine by about February, he said.\n\nBut the plan won't allow access into the inner workings of the mine, which remain blocked by a massive rockfall.\n\nNew Zealand Police say they'll be examining any new evidence from the mine, which they could use to file charges.\n\nAn earlier investigation concluded the Pike River Coal company had exposed miners to unacceptable risks as it strove to meet financial targets. The report found the company ignored 21 warnings that methane gas had accumulated to explosive levels before the disaster.\n\nThe company, which went bankrupt, didn't contest labor violation charges against it.\n\nFormer chief executive Peter Whittall also faced labor charges but they were dismissed after he and the company made a financial settlement, a development which angered many of the grieving families. New Zealand's Supreme Court later ruled the settlement was unlawful.\n\nAny new evidence revealed by re-entering the mine could be used in a new case against him.", "Transcript for More than a quarter million displaced because of California fires\n\nAnd the wildfires, the new eruption today.

A 2017 federal law provided a framework for police to use rapid DNA technology when booking suspects in criminal investigations, and some medical examiners have started using it to identify the dead or are weighing deploying it in disasters.\n\n\"In many circumstances, without rapid DNA technology, it's just such a lengthy process,\" says Frank DePaolo, a deputy commissioner of the New York City medical examiners' office, which has been at the forefront of the science of identifying human remains since 9/11 and is exploring how it might use a rapid DNA device.\n\nThe technology, and DNA itself, has limits. It is sometimes impossible to extract DNA from incinerated remains, and trying to identify remains through DNA requires having a sample from the person when alive or building a profile by sampling close relatives.\n\nBut that doesn't mean there's no hope of identifying the dead without DNA.\n\n\"There's two ways to approach it: You could do a DNA-led identification effort ... (or) more traditionally, the medical examiner and their team of people will try to establish the biological profiles of the unidentified and try to identify them through more traditional methods,\" says Dr. Anthony Falsetti, a George Mason University forensic science professor and forensic anthropologist and a specialist in evaluating human remains.\n\nIn fact, more traditional methods, such as examining dental records, are often a first step. Partially, that's because victims might have dental X-rays but not personal DNA profiles. Other medical records \u2014 of bone fractures, prosthetics or implants, for instance \u2014 also can be helpful.\n\nAnd after a disaster, a crucial part of identifying victims is developing a manifest of the missing people, studying the site for clues as to who might have been there and meticulously searching for remains, sometimes by having a forensic anthropologist sift carefully through the debris, DePaolo said.\n\n\"Ultimately, you may be able to identify that you have a female, a male, a child\" from studying the remains, but science won't give them a name, he said. In such cases, authorities may have to rely on reasoning to match what's known about the remains to who is known to be missing.\n\n\"That manifest may ultimately be the only thing you have to potentially identify that the victims that were recovered from that location could be those victims,\" he said.\n\nNew York medical examiners have worked to match nearly 22,000 fragments of human remains to the 2,753 people killed at the World Trade Center. More than 17 years later, 40 percent of the dead have never had any of their remains identified. But the painstaking process still yields results: The remains of one victim, 26-year-old Scott Michael Johnson, were identified in July for the first time.\n\nWhatever the process proves to be for California authorities, DePaolo said, \"it's a tough and complex job that they have ahead of them, and our condolences go out to them.\"", "A man in Oregon just had a birthday surprise he'll never forget, thanks to a beautiful, heartwarming gesture from his stepdaughter.\n\nOn Thursday, Giselle \"Gigi\" Santoyo presented her stepfather, Alfredo Santoyo of McMinnville, Oregon, with a gift that had him crying almost immediately after he pulled the tissue paper away.\n\nAt the bottom of a big box filled with his favorite snacks lay a certificate revealing that she'd changed her legal last name to match his.\n\nCourtesy Santoyo family\n\n\"Happy birthday!\" the family yelled out in video that Gigi Santoyo posted on social media.\n\nGigi Santoyo told ABC News that Alfredo Santoyo had raised her since she was 5 months old and that she'd wanted to graduate high school with his last name. The family includes Alfredo and Ruby Santoyo and their children, Gigi, Nadia, Alfredo Jr. and Anjelica.\n\nAlfredo and Ruby Santoyo have been together for more than 18 years.\n\n\"Growing up, I've always wanted him to adopt me and he's always wanted to adopt me,\" Gigi Santoyo said.\n\nWhen she turned 18 on Oct. 19, she acted fast, making sure to get her name changed in time for his birthday on Thursday. Ruby and Gigi Santoyo even made sure to get a blessing from Alfredo Santoyo's father to take the family name.\n\nCourtesy Santoyo family\n\nGigi Santoyo said she was really nervous watching him unwrap the gift.\n\n\"His reaction was something I was waiting for and to get the reaction that I got, I knew I did the right thing,\" she said. \"Now that it's legal I feel like I'm more...More a part of the family too, because now we all have the same last name...I just feel like more complete.\"\n\nAlfredo Santoyo told ABC News that the gesture was incredibly touching.\n\n\"Opening up a present and seeing a legal document of her showing me that she had changed her name...It was the greatest thing, the best present I have ever had,\" he said. \"Just seeing her reaction was just wonderful too.\"\n\nCourtesy Santoyo family\n\nHe said Tuesday that he had never once considered Gigi Santoyo different from her siblings.\n\n\"The way I feel now has not changed from what it was before.

Add Interest\n\nIn a remarkable development Tuesday, Melania Trump made a public call for the president's deputy national security adviser to be fired.\n\nRicardel will depart the White House as Trump desired and be reassigned to another role in the administration, according to press secretary Sarah Sanders.\n\n\"Mira Ricardel will continue to support the President as she departs the White House to transition to a new role within the Administration,\" Sanders said. \"The President is grateful for Ms. Ricardel\u2019s continued service to the American people and her steadfast pursuit of his national security priorities.\"\n\nAn extraordinary statement released by Trump's spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, on Tuesday said: \u201cIt is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House.\u201d\n\nCarolyn Kaster/AP\n\nDespite the White House drama, Sanders said earlier in the day Wednesday that Ricardel remained on the job.\n\nVice President Mike Pence became the first major member of the Trump administration to comment on Ricardel's ouster at a stop in Singapore on his Asian trip Thursday.\n\n\"I have great respect for her and her role,\" Pence said. \"I look forward to her new role in another part of the administration.\"\n\nEven amid new rumbles about the potential impending departures of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and even Chief of Staff John Kelly, it is unusual for the normally discreet first lady to get so publicly involved in an administration staffing issues.\n\nThe first lady's bombshell statement was released not long after Ricardel was seen smiling as she stood behind President Trump at an early afternoon Diwali ceremony at the White House Tuesday.\n\nOlivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nRicardel and Melania Trump's office most recently tangled over her solo trip to Africa. Mrs. Trump felt she had treated her staff disrespectfully, White House sources said, and Ricardel was seen as so difficult during the planning of the trip, according to sources, that the first lady\u2019s team sought Kelly's guidance.\n\nThe National Security Council did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRicardel was recruited to the National Security Council by the president's national security adviser, John Bolton. According to the Wall Street Journal, the first lady\u2019s office believed Ricardel was behind negative stories and was known to not get along with Secretary of Defense James Mattis and at times sought to undermine him from within the White House.\n\nA White House official who requested anonymity noted in Ricardel's defense that she is one of the highest-ranking women in the Trump administration and that she has never met the first lady.\n\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\nTrump told ABC News\u2019 Tom Llamas last month, during her first sit-down interview, that she shares her opinions about people she doesn\u2019t trust in the administration with her husband.\n\n\u201cDo you think there's still people there that he can't trust?\u201d Llamas asked.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the first lady said.

The Iranian regime has supported the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad with troops and weapons throughout its conflict.\n\nTice is believed to have been kidnapped by pro-Syrian regime forces while he was covering the civil war in August 2012. Over a month after he was taken, a video was released, showing him blindfolded, removed from a car, and led by armed men up a hill, saying \"Oh, Jesus.\"\n\n\"The Iranians are not helpful, and they're heavily involved in Syria,\" said O'Brien, a lawyer who served in the Marines, advised Mitt Romney and Scott Walker's presidential campaigns and now, as special envoy, leads diplomatic efforts to free Americans unjustly detained abroad and work with their families.\n\nA State Department spokesperson later told ABC News that O'Brien \"did not intend in his comments to link Iran to Tice's disappearance.\"\n\nWhile Tice has not been heard from publicly since that 2012 video, O'Brien declined to say whether the U.S. has received any additional proof of life, instead referencing Tice's physical fitness and age. Still, the U.S. is \"deeply concerned\" about his well-being, O'Brien added.\n\nWhile President Donald Trump has never publicly commented on Tice's case, O'Brien said the president has been briefed regularly on it and would take steps to publicize Tice's case if it helped.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has been \"intimately involved\" in Tice's case, O'Brien said, including meeting with his parents. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has also been leading efforts, in particular working with countries at the U.N. who could help pressure the Syrian regime to assist with his case, like Russia.\n\n\"We continue to call on the Russians to exert whatever influence they can in Syria to bring Austin home,\" said O'Brien. \"It's something the United States would be grateful for.\"\n\nBecause the U.S. closed its embassy in Damascus, the U.S. works through the Czech Republic \"to obtain information about Austin Tice's welfare and whereabouts\" within Syria, another State Department spokesperson told ABC News.\n\nAlso important to these efforts is an FBI reward of $1 million that was announced in April for information leading to Tice's safe location, recovery, and return. O'Brien said it was an important tool that has helped in other American hostage cases.\n\nTice's father Marc and National Press Club President Andrea Edney announced a new campaign to raise up to $1 million to add to the FBI reward. Next year, restaurants in the Washington metro area are set to partner with the Free Austin Tice coalition and donate a portion of their profits on a \"Night Out for Austin Tice\" to the reward fund. Set for May 2, 2019, the date is the eve of World Press Freedom Day, and Edney said they hope to expand the event nationwide.\n\n\"We know Austin longs to walk free. 2,282 days,\" his father Marc said, referring to the number of days his son has now spent missing. \"Austin urgently needs to be freed. Maybe soon.\"\n\nMarc and Debra Tice, his parents, will make another trip to the Middle East this month -- at least their seventh -- as they search for a breakthrough on their son's case. And they will again apply for visas to Syria while they are in Lebanon to try get close to where their son is being held.", "Colombian authorities moved homeless Venezuelan migrants to a soccer field filled with yellow tents and cots Tuesday, as the number of migrants fleeing their nation's economic and humanitarian calamity has risen.\n\nThe first migrant camp for Venezuelans in Colombia's capital sparked a protest from residents who said they feared their new neighbors would bring crime and disease \u2014 the latest hint of escalating tensions throughout the region over the spillover of Venezuela's crisis.\n\n\"They want to ruin our communities!\" a man cried out from his balcony overlooking the field of tents, later switching to English and yelling, \"Welcome to the jungle!\"\n\nColombian officials had been reluctant to set up refugee-style camps, even while similar sites have been created at Ecuador's border with Peru and in Brazil. The new camp is modeled after a temporary refugee settlement for Syrian arrivals in France.\n\nAuthorities fear camps could become permanent fixtures and hinder Venezuelans from integrating into society. But with over 1 million Venezuelans now living in Colombia, officials said they had no choice but to offer tents to destitute migrants.\n\n\"There's nothing else left to do,\" said Cristina Velez, Bogota's secretary for social integration.\n\nThe migrants taken to the camp had been living in a park outside a bus station in conditions considered a potential public health risk. Families with young children were living cramped together alongside railroad tracks and cooking food over makeshift fires. Many had reached Bogota after long walks by foot and didn't have enough money to rent a room.\n\nVelez said Colombian officials talked with their counterparts in Paris over Skype to determine how to create a temporary camp, settling on a model that would keep families together while dividing up single men and women into separate tents. Migrants will be allowed to stay at the camp for up to three months and will be given information on accessing education and health care.\n\nThe initial capacity for the camp will be 500 people, though Velez said officials will evaluate whether a more permanent fixture is needed.\n\n\"We are going step by step because everything has changed very quickly,\" she said.\n\nThe current exodus from Venezuela began in mid-2015 and has climbed steadily as Venezuelans face crippling hyperinflation, food and medicine shortages, and high crime. According to the United Nations, a total of 2.3 million have fled in the last three years alone.\n\nColombia has received more migrants than any other nation at a time when it is already tackling a litany of domestic issues including surging coca production and a fragile peace process with leftist rebels.\n\nThe arrival of so many Venezuelans has sparked xenophobic attacks throughout the region. Last month, a group of Venezuelans living in Colombia's capital said a mob beat a man to death and ransacked their homes while shouting slurs against foreigners. In Brazil, violence erupted after a local storeowner was stabbed and beaten in an assault blamed on Venezuelan migrants.\n\nAs officials transported the Venezuelans to the new camp in Bogota, a dozen angry residents stood in front of a gate attempting to block their arrival. Residents in a large new condominium sat on their balconies now overlooking a field of yellow tents and cots and took photos. Several said they were angry officials hadn't given them advance notice while others worried Venezuelans would take their jobs.\n\n\"I'm going to be left with nothing,\" said Esperanza Contreras, 60, who sells grilled corn and said she feared Venezuelans willing to work for less would steal her customers.\n\nStill others complained that Colombian officials chose a field prone to flooding and expressed worry about sanitary conditions for several hundred migrants sharing 10 portable toilets. They said officials should do more to make sure migrants have access to safe water, food and jobs.\n\n\"Not even animals should be there!\" Giovanna Sanchez, 35, shouted into a microphone outside the camp.\n\nVenezuelans arriving at the camp said they were jolted by the protest.\n\n\"I feel less safe because of what we're seeing outside,\" one man said. \"They don't want us here.\"\n\nAs they completed a registration process and made their way toward the tents, many said they felt deceived by authorities who had promised showers and food.\n\nIvonne Jaimes, 27, cried as she sat on a cot with her 1-year-old son wondering when she would be able to bathe him. She feared they would end up spending more money living at the camp since they are not allowed to cook inside.\n\n\"I feel trapped here,\" she said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nFor more on Associated Press coverage of Venezuela's migrant crisis: https://www.apnews.com/VenezuelaExodus", "Transcript for The Briefing Room: Amazon's new HQ2 locations, tensions rise over Georgia gov. race\n\nAnd yeah. Hi there are welcome to the briefing room on Rick Klein. I'm joined here by clutter full as a whole lot to get to today including some White House staff turmoil and orientation day on capitol level we want to start with top story everywhere today are calling Rebecca Jarvis joins us now from New York City was a very special guest who might be familiar to some viewers of this program Rebecca. Indeed Rick thanks so much yes that's right two cities took the cake today in Amazon's grade bake off from new York and Arlington Virginia. Named the two new place is a four Amazon's HQ to they'll get to split between them 50000 jobs. And five billion dollars in investment and our special guest today joining us to discuss is Jay Carney. Amazon's SB key. Global corporate affairs great to have you with yesterday. Thank you for having you back it's great to be on. So let's talk about this this process lasted over a year 238. Communities why did you end up splitting it between tale. Well we begin the process. Thinking that we would find the location for our second headquarters. That we would. Create 50000 plus jobs in that city and bring about five million dollars or mourn investment. As we went along especially after we narrowed it down to money from the original 238. We really dug in on what our most important criteria were what were the driving factors and and really them the most important of all with talent. You know 50000 is a big number and need to work tech company we need a lot of tech talent we need we needed to go to a place that had. And access to existing talent and also place that would be attractive to folks that we've been recruiting to move. New York and Washington both. Fit the bill the reason why we decided to split into this because. We would knew we would have more success. Recruiting and getting that talent if we divided it into rather than trying to find. Or or bring 50000 new people to one location. New York and Washington both have existing pools of tech talent. They're also a world class cities that people want to move to and so here competing with other companies for talent and you can say come to. The Washington area Arlington Virginia come to New York City. Or come to Seattle. We feel like we have a lot to offer potential and zoning. I gotta say Jay bell I've been getting emails all day long from colleagues in Chicago in Indianapolis and Pittsburgh who are saying. Of course we have talent here why an Amazon she was asked if this is really about Hamlet. Well that its scale I mean at 50000 is a lot let me play put this in perspective and 25000 is a lot to. The average size of fortune a top fortune 500 companies top Tandy. Headquarters is about eleven or 121000. So each of these will be double the size of that average. Not counting the 46000. Folks we have here in Seattle so and were tech heavy company we need we need technology. Folks to to fill these positions in these corporate headquarters. And and there's a lot of competition for that talent so. This that the scale that hit new York and Washington offer was important me. Pool and existing talent that the breadth and depth of that pool. And also. You know there's there's there's no place like New York is no place like Washington when your when your. Trying to convince people. Come join you at Amazon. That's that's a real attraction. So it didn't feel like you could get this scale and these other cities when it comes to new York and Arlington when it turned out they were gonna split this between the two. Did any of the tax incentives that they originally offered come off the table. Well they were cut now. I mean that's that's how it works either performance basis and senate widely available to any company that was pursuing this kind of investment. Nothing you know knew perfectly speckled out of for Amazon. And you know when we said you know parks are our floors in the 45000 for the 50000. You do the incentive packages were reduced accordingly. And and in each case this is an you know pay us now and hope we deliver in the future this is we get the incentives only after we deliver on the job creation. And will be reporting that job creation. Every year in order to to capture the incentives offered. I'd also point out that. Incentives were not the driving factor for us. It's very common practice cities across the country and across North America participated in this and you know all who had economic. Development offices and and put together. You know proposals that included incentives but instead of north the most important if you if you look at some of the for proposals that cities have released publicly. You'll see that yes some places were offering to make it significantly higher incentives but we really. Focused on our talent needs and and the desirability of moving folks in new York and Washington. If they would if we couldn't find workable locally and that's why we citizens places. Amazon also Jay got its hands on a lot of very valuable data throughout this process. What the company planned to do with that information would be used in the future to target customers. This is a perplexing question because we're talking about publicly available information about city's economic growth. There education systems the transportation systems and the like this is not. In this is an. Is it just information some kind of stuff that any company. Doing any kind of significant investment in any city would gather and find from publicly available sources so I. I think you know any company wanted to find out information the kind of information that we found out could find it. We use about a hundred different metrics. When we are looking at different criteria including housing transportation education. You know and and which we we looked at surveys that are publicly available this very firm to Don about. The desirability of locations where his young people coming out of college want to live that kind of thing all these all these bits of information went into. The decision we made but there's nothing here this is not. Valuable beyond what you can find publicly. But is there anything that you will use from this re search. To acquire new customers to target consumers with specific advertising now that you have this information I die. A again this is not this was information about like what is schools look like. What is the transportation grid would like what are the capacities you know what kind of investments will need to be made in order to common eight point 5000 additional employees you know how big is the airport what's the growth. Potential there what's the average education level how much. You know it may be you know universities having this season had a lot of universities but aren't heavily attacked vs cities that have you know compete universities with. Computer science departments or engineering school you know that that's a candidate we're talking about yourself I don't think it's really applicable this. To a business use it really was all about deciding. Neither the best location for to find employees and to attract employees. And finally Jay now that the results are and that its new York and Washington DC. Was it really necessary to hold this sweepstakes across the country. Well absolutely we began. With a completely open mind I promise you that I was in meetings with we're CEO and founder Jeff days us consistently over the course of the year. And you know we deliberated a lot about different options and you know wasn't until recently that we settled on the idea of splitting the headquarters in and we. Came to the conclusion that the Washington area Arlington Virginia and in New York City where there are. Where our best options but there were a lot of great proposals we we you know we saw. Huge potential a lot of locations across the country especially in the twining. Locations that may a finalist list and in fact even during this process we've announced 6000 jobs. In cities they were part of the top morning but didn't make the final two itself economic growth is gonna continue I think yeah we've seen some feedback from places like Miami. Toronto and elsewhere where I just being part of this process has. Elevated their visibility of those cities the disability of potential. Places protect company investment. And that's been a plus for them and I think they've also seen how they can work together with all their stake what was in their cities to make. Those locations even more attractive for investments I think I think there's a lot of upside to this process also because we can we planned this out and we did publicly. Yeah we are now making these investments in new York and Virginia. In a way that we you know we can work with those communities. Knowing that we're going to create at least 45000 jobs in implication. And and and we in the communities can help address some of the effects of that growth. In ways most beneficial to a community you know a lot of companies including Amazon here in Seattle you know they start small and they grow organically nobody would have predicted that Amazon. Would have 46000 employees in Seattle when they launched in Jeffs arrives. Twenty some years ago. Now we know what we're going to be doing in new York and Washington and we can. Healthy communities plan accordingly and build out accordingly with transportation and education life. Amazon's Jay Carney thanks so much for joining us today Jiang. All right Rick back over to you and Washington DC we gotta figure at a business assert a garage. You can't bottom line. And and I think soon to you Rebecca Jarvis ringing with interview with Jay Carney a former white house Press Secretary would have had a spot right here in the briefing room. In another incarnation of Jay Carney. We were weak after the election and there's some unfinished business of course just last night a concession in the Arizona senate race Democrat Kirsten cinema. Is now the winner there are democratic pick up. We are still waiting on the results of the recount both Florida governors as well as the senate race. President trump Catherine just two day putting some pressure on bill Nelson's resides at 22. To concede saying what's taking us along in my all of this even as we wee weed on the results of this recount we could be days and days away. CN and to see vendor to even this week you know he's pushing these claims of voter fraud and your and your right his minister recently was when will none Nelson concede in Florida sells. When determining Ahmed a Muslim. On Capitol Hill today along with other members of congress congress whirling back to hear. We want to check in a Georgia because there's another big race there that is still not been finally determines our Steve Austin Sami has been on this case. Since the beginning covering this race every step of the way it's been a long week. Although the margin still not favoring Stacey Abrams so what's the latest Steve in terms of the deadlines that we're gonna see coming up next couple days. So the deadline to certify the election has been moved by a federal judge to this Friday it was supposed to be today. But because of a lawsuit from so for folks on the blue team. Who have sued to get more absentee ballots counted. Some ballots that have been thrown out that deadline has been moved to Friday. The Abrams camp is in court now today arguing over provisional ballots those are ballots that they give people who have issues when they come to the polls. They want more of those ballots counted now the Abrams people just held. And on the record. Phone a news conference where they announced that they believe that they are 20595. Boats away from forcing this race into a runoff that's their numbers the camp. Folks have a have a different look at things. If they can somehow. Make up that total through these provisional ballots and absentee ballots they think that will be enough to officially. Force this race into a run off and keep in mind. A runoff habits December 4 that is just about three weeks from now in the air in court now still busy fighting this out. And Steve Howe realist. Do we think is that that kind of ground can get made up we haven't seen the gap clothes and we have seen. That the camp numbers it's a whole pretty steadily above that key 50% threshold since election night. I think it's possible but I think it's unlikely. On the Abrams people point out that there are new votes that have been counted every day in their right about that that some of these counties which frankly need to do better about running their elections. Counties that she won are finding new votes every single day but they're not finding. Tens of thousands of votes that type of number that you would think that would make it absolutely clear that she has the ability to force this race into a runoff but. Anything is possible extending that deadline helps Abrams because it gives counties that voted for hurt counties that are favorable to her with more support. Time to perhaps find more absentee votes count more absentee votes. One of the things is that the judge has already ruled is that absentee votes that have birth dates that are incorrect those now are allowed. Are being allowed to be counted and sew up a ruling like that on provisional ballots could also help the Abrams people but the ten people of course say the man. Mathis decidedly in their favor. As Matthew Dowd once said so brilliantly the person who was in the lead which right now is camp he has the advantage. All right now our Steve goes and Sami down in Atlanta for us a rainy day in Atlanta thank you so much for joining us. Catherine let's get to some White House stories you reported earlier today about a possibility. Of a shake up things got even more interest thing since then but let's start with your reporting. On what the possibilities are now four. A shake up that could involve cabinet secretaries even the White House into south. Yes we have been here before we're talking about staff shake up not just saw Jeff Sessions laughed a little while the but now the focus is on. The president's Department of Homeland Security secretary Christian Nielsen. They the two have sparred you know the past few months over immigration policy specifically there's been. I yelling matches in the west wing so he's considering removing her from that post bananas also provides this talk of them. His chief of staff John Kelly now you remember we reported that. I'm Kelly said that he would accept the president's offer to stay through twenty Tony but. The president is now lying that someone assisting the south his vice president. As vice president's chief of staff. Nick heiress and to have. Become really close and and Aris was there on election night in the White House huddling with president and they've had a conversation about this particular job as you mentioned. Things just moments ago got a little interesting you know White House isn't. It's it's maybe too often in this in trump White House who say that I've never seen this happen before now I can never call an incident like this and what we're referring to specifically Katherine is that the First Lady put any public statement. Identifying an individual a deputy national security advisor Mir ever Carnell. And said that this woman and no longer deserves the honor of working in the White House any longer we saw hurt just today. Via the tenements here was quite striking had a story. In is mentioned are reporting about about Kelly and in Nielsen and also said. That he and that president had removed them Bolton said deputy national security advisor OK says the story was there and then she showed up behind the president in this event. In the west wing then the first lady's office said. It is the position of the personally knew that he you know she referring to Ricardo no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House and I your number and the the first lady's office releasing this statement in that interview. With Tommy Thomas and they sent on Africa. And she said that there are still people in the west wing that she doesn't think the president contrasts but when it named them. So this is clearly an example what are we think could even potentially be behind this this is such a strange turn of events to go into. The deputy national security advisor and an obviously discuss some kind of a personal conflict here I can't imagine that did the first lady's office was speak publicly like that unless they felt like they needed to it. Have you right that's a good question exactly in what led to this what happened here was the conflicts with John Bolton how does early to John Kelly I think. We're still really trying to sort all of that out but there was in there clearly is an issue and between the First Lady and and that's won't. And it would appear to be resolved in that way stay tuned for more in terms of the shake ups follow Katherine is reporting ABC's not the abcnews.com. That's been terrific every step of away an interesting moment today was we mentioned orientation for freshmen members of congress. Lots of them are swarming around Capitol Hill trying to get their bearings usually is a day check out the new offices you get told little about. Staffing positions but it was a protest not unusual thing outside Nancy Pelosi is office she's of course. The front runner to presumed next week girlish as a lot down the votes yet this was around environmental issues to encourage more quick action on global warming. So interesting showed up Katharine. Alexandria a cost Joseph Cortez the now they congresswoman elect. From the New York City area there in Queens New York she was right in the middle of this group there are more than fifty arrests she was not among them. But she was lending her voice and her presents to this Gruber protesters. As you see right there quite an image for a congresswoman elect we're outside the office of the house democratic leader and right just a remarkable start. In Friday see her there in the middle. Middle of the protests speaking but it you know this comes heard as many senior Democrats have said they planned to support Pelosi and her bid for speaker but at least. You know I think there is what are we have to five new members in midnight we're sending members at least to say they don't Clinton supporter we know we know there are some reports behind the scenes that. And she's making calls and working the phones but she still think she's 100% copper. Numbers are not there yet she's got a couple of weeks to work it out be the house leadership elections actually occur a couple of weeks from now right after Thanksgiving. Interesting she gave an interview to CNN. Pelosi where she says that she is they aren't part to make sure that women don't get pushed around that is quite a card to play.

Moderate air quality is a reading of 50 to 100, while bad air quality is any measurement of 100 to 200 and anything higher is considered very unhealthy or hazardous.\n\nOakland, which is more than 160 miles from the Camp Fire, had a reading of 164 on Tuesday, while San Francisco had a reading of 167.\n\nOxnard in Ventura County, which is about 30 miles of the epicenter of Woolsey Fire, had the worst air in the state outside the fire zone Tuesday with a hazardous reading of 392 while Gridley, about 30 miles from the Camp Fire, had a reading hazardous reading of 250.\n\n\"I've lived in the Bay Area for over 35 years and except for the Oakland Hills fires and Napa fires, I can't remember consistent smoke like this,\" Troy Blanchard of Oakland told KGO.\n\nOn Monday and Tuesday, the Golden Gate Bridge in San Franciso was clouded in smoke.

Cerrato allegedly passed checks to Ramon Lobo.\n\nPorfirio Lobo's wife has been held since February on charges of diverting $700,000 in public funds. His son, Fabio, was sentenced in the U.S. last year to 24 years in prison for drug trafficking.\n\n\"Those running this country are allowing them to violate my human rights and trample my dignity,\" Porfirio Lobo said. \"It is all a show, a trick, to divert public attention from the government's notorious corruption cases.\"\n\nAn international anti-corruption mission backed by the Organization of American States is working with Honduran prosecutors. In June, prosecutors announced an investigation into public funds that were allegedly diverted to the 2013 campaign of President Juan Orlando Hernandez.\n\nThe charges against Lobo's brother could be the final straw in the deterioration of the relationship with his successor, Hernandez.\n\n\"It's clear that Lobo is upset with President Hernandez, who he sees as disloyal,\" political analyst Raul Pineda Alvarado said.\n\nHe said Hernandez is trying to shore up his international reputation as serious about fighting corruption by going after a prominent name like Lobo from his own party.\n\nLobo was Hernandez's mentor and oversaw his rise to power within the National Party. Hernandez was re-elected to a second term last year in a disputed election.\n\nThousands of Honduran migrants have been traveling toward the U.S. border in multiple caravans during the past month complaining of an economy that doesn't allow them to support their families and oppressive gang crime. Many frequently chant against Hernandez's government, blaming him for their dire straits.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump threatened to cut off aid to Honduras if Hernandez did not stop his citizens from migrating.", "bad url", "A gray wolf relocated this fall from mainland Minnesota to Isle Royale National Park has died of unknown causes, officials said Tuesday, a minor setback in a multiyear plan to rebuild the predator species on the Lake Superior archipelago.\n\nThe 5-year-old male was among the first two wolves released at the park Sept. 26 . Staff biologists became concerned in late October when his radio tracking collar indicated he was no longer on the move, park spokeswoman Liz Valencia said.\n\nA team traced the animal and found its carcass, which bore no bite marks or other signs that it had been killed by another wolf. It was taken to a federal wildlife health lab in Madison, Wisconsin, for a necropsy. Results are expected in December, Valencia said.\n\nThe fatality was the second since officials kicked off a plan to take 20 to 30 wolves to the park over the next several years to replenish its depleted population. A female died in a mainland holding facility in September.\n\n\"It's certainly not something you'd want to happen but it was not unexpected,\" Valencia said. \"It's a high-risk operation.\"\n\nOthers are likely to die as the Isle Royale project continues, said Rolf Peterson, a Michigan Technological University biologist who studies the park's wolves and moose. Some won't make the transition to new habitat smoothly, while others will starve or be killed in territorial disputes with fellow wolves, he said.\n\nPeterson said he hadn't seen the dead male's carcass but that hunger or stress were among possible factors.\n\nIt would be hard for a single wolf to bring down even a young moose, he said, although the island has plenty of beaver on which wolves can feed. Park officials shot six moose and spread some of the meat to give the new arrivals a temporary food supply, but it would have been picked over fairly quickly.\n\n\"Wolves live a very brutal life,\" Peterson said. \"Their normal condition is extremely lean.\"\n\nIsle Royale's wolf numbers averaged in the 20s for decades before plummeting more recently, largely because of inbreeding. Only two remained earlier this year.\n\nScientists say predators are needed to prevent the moose herd, which totals about 1,500, from becoming so large that the voracious animals overeat trees and shrubs.\n\nThe other wolf released Sept. 26 is doing well, as are two others that arrived in October, Valencia said. Counting the two aging survivors, the park now has five wolves.\n\nThe newcomers were trapped on the Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa reservation in Minnesota. More are expected in January from the Canadian province of Ontario. Plans call for relocating additional wolves from Michigan's Upper Peninsula.", "Transcript for Volunteers pitch in to rally support for animals displaced by Camp Fire\n\nShe high.

As we all watched on pins and heels waiting to see if rescuers would be able to get them out and we now know of course. That ended with one of the most amazing rescues in history. Luckily Matt Gutman was there on the ground as it happened and he's here with us today to take us behind the scenes with his new book. The boys in the cave Matt can cracks on the book coming out first of all thank you Diane and thanks for Kona hi Alice always great to talk to you. Love getting the behind the scenes on stories like this and Anderson you brought some photos if you want to. I did so I just got these photos so basically and Kate was flooded. The very last moments of the rescue. But all the boys got out but there for Thai Navy SEALs who were bring up the rear they'd spent a few days at the boys just to assure them. It's gonna be okay and they will be there for the duration but after the last two Thai navy seal divers came out the cape flooded. And everybody started bailing. It was indicate basically filled up with water and it stayed that way. Until these folks came in to start cleaning it up my accidents like this time capsule of those last moments just as those people. The Thai Navy SEALs were rescued and EC. Bottles strewn everywhere have there are plastic chairs. And hundreds and hundreds of air tanks just left to right there on the ground where they wore as people fled the cave helter skelter. When that water came up I think it had a chance to go back and get any that's after the time is literally not nobody's been in their sits flat it's incredible and and Thai government has. Cordoned off the KV used to be open to the public and nobody was dumb enough to go in there during the monsoon season not that the boys did. But typically they didn't need to have to send Saddam but now it's become this. Next up for visitors they've. Light incense and offer the spirits of the cave. Papaya juice and all these different offerings on it's become this this. Fantastic tour tourist attraction in Thailand it's it's just the interesting thing that nobody's been there are now. The whole place is cut off by these giant chain link fence. He can't get into Bradley used to be it is really remote deserted little Caylee nobody know visited massive write action but. I mean to many people a miracle happened there. I just want to say one more thing about the cave itself so I got the Thai Rangers to you let me end because I was doing a book and I just basically convince them. It's pretty incredible so parts of the cave are. You know its highs as chair right. It's chill feed and uses tiny hole but that main entrance which these guys took mean to see this is one of those tight tunnels. That you're seeing. Basically about six feet high that's the cave itself that chamber nine were the boys were hunker down you can see how me seated they were. After twelve days of not eating but. Parts of it. Were easily big enough to fit a 747. And how us you know having reported on it for months and then finally seeing it. It was seventy yards high almost time enough to fit a hockey arena and bumped 200 yards long that first entrance that first chamber. It was so amazing game to see it in person I can see why. So many people been enamored with an eye can see way. The coach took the boys in as this in a fantastic team building exercise. An excursion for those boys. Obviously he didn't think it would end up the way it ended. Cores in I have been an and it's similar cave. It was not in Thailand it was in Belize but even be. Did that in these expenses you go in says parts of the kids like you're mentioning and there are huge I mean it's like you're in a dining hall or something even lighter and then you crawl there was space in your in this tiny little section and so to think in my mind about what it would have been like to go through that cave in the dark. Under water I can imagine how these rescuers were able to get these plays out and I think that's what. Made this story so compelling to so many people they're trying to put themselves in their place they almost can't even imagine what it's like. And you're on pins and needles thinking how on earth are they gonna do this I'm wondering what it was like for you to actually be there. As all this was happening is just watching on TV we we were on the edge of our seats as one by one we start hearing these boys are making it out what was it like they're on the ground. We didn't know how much we didn't know. Right. We figured okay somehow they figured out a mechanism to get an out but what the Thai government told us at the time was actually wrong. They didn't even know. How the boys were being extracted they said two divers to a boy they did not tell us that the boys were completely sit dated this is you crawl in Connecticut that's me. Until we did we simulated that would instantly we went through a nearby cave. And you know this is one of the baker chambers but. I think you'd probably in his spare you seeing my butt. Because I had to slip there through what of these tight spaces and all you see is might mice might dirty trousers. So I think we're gonna spare viewers from that but. That's where the incredible things that the divers go through is. They have their air tanks. And they have these boys and it's one diver to one point and the boys this is a secret that your only know learn in the book nobody else's have reported this. They were bound hands and feet. With zip ties the receipt dated so heavily with -- mean the could have knocked them out the could have amputated and arm don't open heart surgery that would have felt a thing. And they were hauled out of the cave and they kept having to be recent dated all along. Because. The divers were concerned that if they came to they would panic and start ripping off their own mask or the divers mask and that bill could die. And so they were taking the methodically through. These spaces with C dated boys bound hand and feet through areas as you know far off the ground as its chair. Putting the boys through one of the divers got lost and his boy almost had he was hypothermia can almost died another boy eight. Stopped breathing after the second dose of sedation. And they didn't know if he would survive. It was touching some advocates are hyperventilating when there's a dated and these divers are in the cave. In the dark. And underwater at times it couldn't even tell if the boys were briefed this is so much pressure sometimes the only way they could tell. Gays they kept the boys really close to their face because they're diving they're holding on to straps. And they could feel the bubbles coming up the side of their mouth that's the only way they could tell that the boys were still alive. And so when they finally got them to chamber three which is about two thirds of the way out of the cave and that's where the US. Air force special tactics team was waiting with. A real medical. Crew and they shove them out in two. That chamber out of the water and Mitzi is your life because they had no idea and then especially for for the first four boys. Everybody in that chamber sort of waited as the medic who listened in he put his ear on. The boys neoprene suit and they were so skinny guitar to actually hear heartbeats that put their urine. Finally seconds would go pies take. He's a lot. And everybody in that. A young people said the Chinese these are taking video. Are already exist today. It was just this incredible moment my all these from all over the world they were Chinese and Thai and brits and French and gains. And probably others as well Finns who weren't Carlos came together to help save this boy it was incredible. And I you know you mention this a lot of people didn't know this until the book that two of these boys did come very close to losing their lives here. Very close and going in the divers estimated that 75 to 80% of the boys would die. They really thought that between eight and ten of the boys would die during the extraction. The boys had been in a cave in the dark for. Nearly three weeks at this point. They add up only had a few meals under their belt when they were found. They'd been deprived of light of air they were breeding 15% oxygen. And some of the net had had the early stages of pneumonia. And. They didn't know if they could make it out that enough they're physically capable. But the fact that they survived is remarkable. And they really didn't see it and you know. I don't know if you can see these videos this is then just trying to still look for them in the beginning. And that's when the boys were found to have the space blankets they were freezing and there. The it was 73 degrees in chamber nine but the boys were already freezing all the time because the bodies had eaten away. Most of their muscle and their fat right and so they were called cold all the time. Just trying to survive and winds keep blankets were actually essential if you think the deck and not have. In more stacked against them which is what makes the whole conclusion of all this so amazing the fact they all got out the coach got out. I mean these divers are true heroes. And that this is a rescue that also almost didn't happen that's racking that the government not necessarily knowing what the plan was. Even as it was going down but they almost put the kibosh on the cell together. They had promised the public a zero risk option they said we're gonna get all the boys out brawl and a walk out of the cave they hope that they would walk out of a cave. After the monsoon season when all that water you see. Just clears out clears out or drain. But this American special tactics team and the British divers who were really that the people were able to go deepest earliest said hey listen. If you wait until the end of the monsoon season. They were either drowned to death by these rising waters we have another months and coming in a couple of days it will start to death because we can't get food out there. Fuel is 68 because if they don't drown the oxygen level that team is 15% if it gets any lower. They will die rain carbon monoxide was rising because they it was a trapped chambers so. We are you read out their breathing out carbon monoxide carbon dioxide and they were this. So is there were losing an oxygen gaining carbon dioxide in the cave. And their chances of survival are increasingly. Decreasing. And they said if you don't pull them out they're all gonna die if you do try to go for this. Rescue dive maybe we can save some of them now. And the leader that incident the incident command leader whose name is governor in Iran sacked symbol what do you consider a successful mission. And the American major was in charge of it Charlie Hodges. Said honestly if we bring one boy out to his parents. I would consider that a successful mission. You know so the Thai government is going from. We're gonna save everybody. Q being presented with the option of well made one that made Canadian success. Obviously that was a tough pill to swallow but anti government did. The courageous staying. By biting the bullet in deciding hey we're gonna try to save some of them on even if we can't save all of them. And at least provide one family or a couple of families with their son and you know and we still have the bodies of their kids and that's what the divers thought they're like well. If we can't rescue them alive at least we can bring out their bodies. And I know you have now spent a lot of time with those divers to. It must've been indescribable for them to be able to walk way from this and say. Holy Kelly save them all especially given the expectations that they went into this with how to they look back on that Dana. They can't believe it either and it's in three days that they honestly didn't think that they'd pull it off and by the second day they start to think well will made that we can do this and that's when the pressure started rising. And after that second David Thai prime minister. Came by and he was cheering and then. You know Elon Musk showed up and it started to become a real circus and that's when the pressure had of that third day was really rising these guys starting getting nervous and everybody now expects us to save all of these break but we still don't know we can pull this off. Because the last four boys were the weakest two of those boys had pneumonia. And they had thought that big and try to bring the strongest out first. And they didn't know if the last four boys which included the two smallest weakest voice would make it said the pressure was on until the very. And now how did they pick an Arab he knows that had they pick the order so there's a bit of controversy that controversy but little mystery here so the police told me. That they decided to do it based on an order of who lives farthest away it's actually quite quick. They said well we have our bikes still out parked outside the case we have to ride home up so we want to give the boys who live farthest away a headstart that. And the ones who live close is wolf you know. Elliott he had no idea with waiting for you got that they had no idea eight you know there are thousands of literally thousands of people waiting outside and other parents were there they had sent. Once they were discovered they sent letters to their family Tseng. You know I'll help you back at the store you know as soon as we get out please tell my teacher that I hear all of you know complete a coworker I doubt literally intersected kids. Ensco in the had no idea the that the media circus that awaited and the amount of attention that they would get when this was all over. They had been shielded from it by the coach and the divers say they just didn't want them to focus on that they wanted him to just think about getting out making sure they can survive. And what are the divers is the last ever going into the last boy thinking thanks a lot. No pressure is so the last diver. Actually had a successful dive he was okay it was the second to last diver who got lost. And really had some trouble. So it's there's sort of a jug handle in one of the chambers and he basically went around in the circle he it was so dark he lost the guideline and you swimming with his boy. And he's it was Hong. And he lost the guideline and he couldn't find the way out of the cave and he basically had to double back when and his voice started freezing to death. And he was unconscious he recent dated him but he didn't know what to do was only because the very last divers came out with. There boys. That was last diver and then the anesthesiologist. Came out that day he realized oh that's the direction of the exit. And the anesthesiologist. Had to take that last boy because. Bomb the diver who got lost with so rattled. He'd almost died. He'd almost caused this boy may be to lose his life so it was really really touch and go until the very end. And the fact that became flooded right after they've got allies and I don't eat. It's its main for a movie ON and yet happened in real life. It's a they didn't know Susie US special forces team who organizes it organized and they had the medics in that area who made the initial assessment of the boys. And they were given the code word landslide. In case anything went cataclysmic re wrong. Rock slide somebody got hurt or any anything that forced an evacuation in so. When McCain started flooding at the very end because the pumps broke and the water started rising they yelled out landslide labs like landslide. And everybody started bailing. And they had to wait for the last four Thai Navy SEALs and as their exit there is one exit it was at a tunnel that was basically had high. It was silly to the very rich top and made and have scuba equipment scenario makes me nervous is tell me now are in right now ring joke like this as the the last that they waited for the last night divers. And they all got out with seconds to spare and they. Sort of sift the air puckered their lips and sit the air at the top of the tunnel basically bouncing up and down. And that's how they made it out alive without drowning and then no one has been the case since then and then you see those pictures so it's just an incredible story. Freely and him and what's great about the book is that there's so much in there that keep people think they know so much about the story but there are so many little bits and pieces that we don't including some of the ones you just shared. But there was also a rescue before the rescue. You know the story so well Diane otherwise tension. That hit the of those British divers and I mentioned went on a reconnaissance mission the first day that they got there which is a week into the rescue pretty much. And they had no idea what they'll find who they would find and though that the water had really flooded to a high level. And a day earlier. The Thai government had ordered a complete evacuation of the K now what these two divers didn't know. Is that there were four tie pump war person who got marooned about a thousand yards in. It's that they're doing a recon mission trying to figure out what gave his like with the waters like Italy that pop up. And they see these four guys like. Don't let who are you know what do you care. Many outside of boys suckered right. And they had to rescue them one by one they were prepared for rescue and that's when they knew that they needed to sedate the boys. Because as they started coming up with. These guys that they had to rescue they were sharing their respirator when and regulator. That the the guys were rescued started swimming away inclined to the exit. And they realize that they panicked each of them had panicked in the water so hard not tonight. And you're talking that was look up 5060 foot dive and they would have had to have done a mile underwater with those boys. If they had been awake they just would have lost it ran would have panicked and that's when the tide did the British divers in new. That they had to completely sedate the boys in order to have any chance of affecting a successful rescue. On thank god they did and nomad this I mean for me this story is just it's incredible that I know you have traveled the world you've covered countless stories. What was it about this on that made you decide I have to read a book about this. There were so much we didn't know and the chances. What I just didn't know how much it didn't know. And then once they started reporting more about it. I a entered this world at a hadn't even expected. You know the world of of Thailand and buddhism. And diving. And caves and these rescuers in this very knee should thing of cave rescues it was just an incredible thing and I guess you're seeing here not see the helicopter the rescue helicopter there it is that they used to fly the boys to safety. There's just so much we didn't know. And just every little tidbit I got was fascinating. What's this 10 this is the entrance to the cave and you can see and that's when the pump trucks by the way. And obviously that's one of the tunnels luckily again you're not seeing the but picture here your very. I we're waiting for that I thought I was good TV when I'm I don't then and I'll I see is like my my my experiment I spent there. And it was not a great thing. They I was just so much fun team.

Ralph Northam said the key may not have been the hundreds of millions of dollars that were promised if the company delivered on its job-creation promises \u2014 indeed, many states offered much richer incentive packages.\n\nInstead, he said what made Virginia's bid distinct was \"investments in our people,\" particularly a $1 billion Virginia Tech University graduate campus to be built near the new Amazon headquarters that will churn out hundreds of qualified high-tech workers annually.\n\n\"Virginia's proposal to Amazon represents a new model of economic development for the 21st century,\" Northam said in a celebratory press event Tuesday in an old warehouse that will be knocked down to create Amazon office space. \"The vast majority of the commonwealth's proposal is investments in our people that will align with Amazon's long-term goals.\"\n\nThe linchpin of that investment is the \"Innovation Campus\" planned for the Potomac Yard neighborhood of Alexandria, just a couple miles south of where Amazon will be.\n\nThe campus will be part of Virginia Tech, and the first 100 master's degree students will enroll next year in temporary space. When it's finished, the campus will enroll 750 master's degree candidates, train hundreds of doctoral students and will include on-campus housing, officials said.\n\nStephanie Landrum, director of economic development in Alexandria, suggested that when Virginians look back on Tuesday's announcement, the establishment of the Virginia Tech campus may be even more monumental than Amazon's arrival. She said the campus will not only feed Amazon but other tech companies that have been drawn to the region, and are diversifying the region's economy from its large reliance on the federal government and defense spending.\n\nRep. Don Beyer, a Democrat who represents the area, said he expects the campus to eventually rival Ivy League schools and MIT in prestige for developing high-quality tech workers.\n\n\"The reason Amazon is coming is that they see already the talent that is here in northern Virginia,\" Beyer said.\n\nVirginia Tech said the plans for the Innovation Campus mesh perfectly with the university's longstanding plans to increase its footprint in northern Virginia and meet demand for computer science and other high-tech degrees. Amazon's other new headquarters will be built in a New York City neighborhood that is near a new technology-oriented graduate school called Cornell Tech.\n\n\"We need to be where our partners are,\" said Virginia Tech President Tim Sands. \"Here we have the opportunity to be within 2 miles of Amazon.\"\n\nThe plan calls for the state and Virginia Tech to each commit $250 million to the campus. The rest will be raised through philanthropic efforts and public-private partnerships, officials said.\n\nIn neighboring Arlington County, where Amazon will be physically located, officials echoed the sentiment that the incentives offered to Amazon mesh with existing plans for infrastructure and transportation improvements, and long-term plans to remake the Crystal City neighborhood.\n\nArlington's incentive package \u2014 which includes hundreds of millions in transportation improvements, many of which were already included in long-range plans \u2014 is designed not so much to lure Amazon with cash but to ensure Amazon and the county have a mutually beneficial environment, said Arlington County Board Chair Katie Cristol.\n\n\"This announcement not only aligns with our existing plans and serves Amazon's needs but will also benefit our Arlington community,\" Cristol said.\n\nStill, the incentive package was met by some with skepticism that the planned transportation improvements will be insufficient to alleviate traffic and that the incentives still amount to corporate welfare.\n\n\"We're going to be enriching some of the wealthiest people in the world at the expense of Virginians who work hard to make ends meet,\" said Del. Lee Carter, a Democrat who represents Manassas and bills himself as a democratic socialist. \"We're going to crowd schools, clog roads, and we're paying for the privilege.\"", "Two weeks after the deadly Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, the FBI released it's 2017 hate crimes statistics which revealed a 17 percent increase in incidents since 2016.\n\nIn 2017 there were 8,493 victims and 6,307 known offenders. By comparison there were 7,509 victims and 5,727 known offenders in 2016, according to the data. It's also worth noting that more law enforcement agencies participated in reporting hate crime statistics in 2017.\n\n\"This report is a call to action -- and we will heed that call,\" Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said in a statement. \"The Department of Justice\u2019s top priority is to reduce violent crime in America, and hate crimes are violent crimes.\"\n\nIn 2016 there were 6,036 single-bias incidents, or occurrences where the perpetrator has one bias against a community or group. By comparison, in 2017, there were 7,106 single-bias incidents reported.\n\nAccording to the FBI, \"58.1 percent were motivated by a race/ethnicity/ancestry bias, 22.0 percent were prompted by religious bias, 15.9 percent resulted from sexual-orientation bias and 1.7 percent were motivated by gender-identity bias.\"\n\n\"I am particularly troubled by the increase in anti-Semitic hate crimes -- which were already the most common religious hate crimes in the United States -- that is well documented in this report,\" Whitaker said in his statement.", "A handwritten letter written by Albert Einstein warning of the dangers of growing nationalism and anti-Semitism years before the Nazis rose to power has been sold for nearly $40,000.\n\nThe Kedem Auction House says the previously unknown letter, brought forward by an anonymous collector, fetched $39,360 in bidding in Jerusalem on Tuesday night.\n\nEinstein wrote the letter to his sister after going into hiding in 1922 following the assassination of Germany's Jewish foreign minister by right-wing extremists. Police had warned the Jewish scientist that his life could be in danger too.\n\n\"Here are brewing economically and politically dark times, so I'm happy to be able to get away from everything,\" he wrote.\n\nKedem says the letter was sold at roughly double its expected price.", "Rep. Martha McSally received widespread praise from people on both sides of the political aisle for her concession speech Monday night in which she bowed out of the tight race for Arizona's Senate seat.\n\nInterested in Midterm Elections? Add Midterm Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Midterm Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nThe laudatory reaction prompted widespread speculation that she might be leaving the door open for a future foray back into politics.\n\nBut with the current state of Arizona politics, there's a possible scenario wherein she could re-enter the scene sooner than expected -- and possibly become a colleague of the woman who just beat her in the last race.\n\nMcSally and now-Senator-elect Kyrsten Sinema battled it out over the seat that was left open when Sen. Jeff Flake decided not to seek re-election.\n\nMonths after that campaign started, Sen. John McCain passed away, but that happened after the state deadline that would allow for his replacement to be elected as part of the 2018 midterms.\n\nAs a result, the governor was tasked with picking a temporary placeholder for McCain's seat. Gov. Doug Ducey announced on Sept. 4 that former Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl, who served alongside McCain from 1995 to 2013, would take temporary control of McCain's seat.\n\nDavid Wallace/The Arizona Republic via USA Today Network, FILE\n\nThat said, 76-year-old Kyl only committed to serving in McCain's seat through the remainder of this session of Congress, which ends on Jan. 3, 2019.\n\nState law dictates that it will fall to Ducey, who was just re-elected, to appoint someone of McCain's same political party to hold the seat until the next general election.\n\nAs such, it's within reason and the law to think that Ducey could appoint McSally, who is a Republican like McCain was, to hold his seat until the 2020 election.\n\nNeither Ducey's office nor McSally's campaign returned ABC News' requests for comment.\n\nRichard Herrera, a political science professor at Arizona State University, said that the close nature of the recent Senate race could help make McSally a front-runner.\n\n\"I think it's very plausible,\" Herrera said.\n\n\"I would think she's the favorite,\" he added, noting that the close nature of the Senate race and McSally's support for President Donald Trump could be helpful advantages for her.\n\n\"She checks a lot of boxes,\" Herrera said.\n\nIlana Panich-Linsman/The New York Times via Redux/FILE\n\nAnd while the Senate race between McSally and Sinema did get nasty -- with McSally claiming during their debate that Sinema made treasonous comments -- McSally ended it on a gracious note, posting a kind video congratulating Sinema and saying that she \"wish[ed] her all success\" in the Senate.\n\nMatthew Dowd, who was a strategist for George Bush's 2004 presidential campaign and the current political analyst for ABC News, said that McSally's concession speech \"should be lauded.\"\n\n\"It is a good and necessary move in a bitter divisive environment. I always give the presumption to someone that they are being genuine, and being from the military I think McSally supports the democratic norms,\" Dowd said.\n\nDemocratic political strategist and former interim chairperson of the Democratic National Committee Donna Brazile retweeted McSally's video, writing \"this is what civility looks like,\" and praising McSally later to ABC News.\n\nThis is what civility looks like. https://t.co/NHfwDiogUS \u2014 Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) November 13, 2018\n\n\"She clearly invoked the spirit of John McCain,\" Brazile said of McSally. \"As a Veteran, she understands what it means to serve. Her calling continues.\"\n\nHerrera also thought it could indicate a possible foothold for a future run.\n\n\"I would always lean towards strategic decision-making on the part of politicians, so I would say it's strategic looking forward,\" Herrera said. \"Now, that doesn't mean it wasn't sincere.\"", "Transcript for The Briefing Room: Jay Carney on why Amazon chose to do a sweepstakes for its HQ2\n\nNow that the results are an Bennett's new York and Washington DC. Was it really necessary to hold this sweepstakes across the country. Well absolutely we began. With a completely open mind I promise you that I was in meetings with we're CEO and founder Jeff days us consistently over the course of the year. And you know we deliberated a lot about different options and you know wasn't until recently that we settled on the idea of splitting headquarters in that we. Came to the conclusion that the Washington area Arlington Virginia and in New York City where there. Where our best options but there were a lot of great proposals we we you know we saw. Huge potential a lot of locations across the country especially in the twining. Locations that made our. A finalist list and in fact even during this process we've announced 6000 jobs. In cities they were part of the top morning but didn't make the final two itself that kind of growth is gonna continue I think that we've seen some feedback from places like Miami. Toronto and elsewhere where I just being part of this process has. Elevated their visibility of those cities for the stability of potential. Places protect company investment. And that's been a plus for them and I think they've also seen how they can work together with all their stake what was in their cities to make. Those locations even more attractive for investment so I think. I think there's a lot outside in this process also because we can we planned this out and we did publicly. Yeah we are now making these investments in new York and Virginia. In a way that we you know we can work with those communities. Knowing that we're going to create at least 45000 jobs in implication. And and and we in the communities can help address some of the effects of that growth. In a way that's most beneficial to a community you know a lot of companies including Amazon here in Seattle you know they start small and they grow organically nobody would have predicted that Amazon. Would have 46000 employees in Seattle and they launched in Jeffs arrives. Twenty some years ago. Now we know what we're going to be doing in new York and Washington and we can.

Great characters and the best actually could that possibly result Davis who sort of reserves are derision panel to be in the Emmy some schools. And how you know you'd talk a lot about the cast which I do want to jump into briefly because of the fact that they are so pivotal. Obviously you call and I think you said it perfectly when knew that you know they are the Barack Obama they aren't amount Max the army's ordinary people. The two extraordinary thing I'm in my mind to. Yeah and so when you get all thought about obviously that this Ceres that you know you grew up watching inverse is making this film.

He ran the Memphis Noticias online news outlet and reported on the effects of U.S. immigration policies in the Hispanic community. Duran's lawyers have said he came to the U.S. without permission in 2006 after receiving death threats related to reporting on corruption in El Salvador.\n\n\"It's dangerous for me to return to my country,\" he said in Spanish during the conference call.\n\nDuran had been critical of law enforcement in his reporting. Activists say he faced retaliation for it. Memphis police have repeatedly denied those allegations, saying officers arrested Duran after an order to clear the street was given.\n\nDuran said he was just doing his job as a journalist when he was arrested.\n\n\"I was doing the right thing,\" he said.\n\nIn October, the Board of Immigration Appeals in Virginia denied an appeal in the case. Duran's lawyer, Michelle Lapointe, said he could be deported within two weeks if the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta does not agree to delay his removal and reopen his deportation case. A ruling is pending.\n\nLapointe, who works with the Southern Poverty Law Center, said she will ask for asylum for Duran if the court does agree to open his case because reporters are facing worsening conditions in El Salvador.\n\nDuran was issued a deportation order in 2007 after he failed to show up for court. His lawyers have said that he did not receive notice to report to court before the deportation order was issued.\n\nAfter Duran's April 3 arrest, disorderly conduct and obstruction of a highway charges were dropped. Authorities in Memphis then handed him over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\"We would not be in this situation if he had not been targeted for exercising his First Amendment rights reporting the news that was critical of local policies and ICE policies that harmed his community,\" Lapointe said.\n\nDuran was transferred from Memphis to an ICE facility in Louisiana. Duran said he has experienced poor conditions, including bad food and dirty bathrooms with no toilet paper, in ICE facilities in Louisiana.\n\nICE spokesman Bryan Cox denied Duran's allegations. Cox said the facility where Duran is being held in Jena, Louisiana, has been inspected by multiple groups and has passed inspection.\n\nDuran's lawyers have sought his release from ICE custody as they fight his deportation. Duran's longtime partner, Melisa Valdez, said the past months without Duran have been \"a nightmare.\"\n\nShe said Duran is not a criminal and is not a danger to the Memphis community.\n\n\"His arrest and detainment only show the government has displaced priorities,\" Valdez said during the conference call. \"I find it extremely unfair that someone can be jailed indefinitely without committing a crime.\"", "Transcript for What is on the Khashoggi killing tape?\n\nI'm that me Gary for ABC news live in Istanbul Turkey.

Are calling Rebecca Jarvis joins us now from New York City was a very special guest who might be familiar to some viewers of this program are back up. Indeed Rick thanks so much yes that's right two cities took the cake today and Amazon's grade bake off from new York and Arlington Virginia. Named bid to new place is a four Amazon's HQ to they'll get to split between them 50000 jobs. And five billion dollars in investment and our special guest today joining us to discuss is Jay Carney. Amazon's SBP's. Of global corporate affairs great to have you with yesterday. Thank you for having you back it's great to be on. So let's talk about this this process lasted over a year 238. Communities why did you end up splitting it between tale. Well we begin the process. Thinking that we would find the location for our second headquarters. That we would. Create 50000 plus jobs in that city and bring about five million dollars to mourn investment. As we went along especially after we narrowed it down to money from the original 238. We really dug in on what our most important criteria were what were the driving factors and and really them the most important of all with talent. You know 50000 is a big number. And need to work tech company we need a lot of tech talent we need we needed to go to a place that had. And access to existing talent and also place that would be attractive to folks that we've been recruiting to move. New York and Washington. Fit the bill the reason why we decided to split into his because. We would knew we would have more success. Recruiting and getting that talent if we divided it into rather than trying to find. Or or bring 50000 new people to one location new York and Washington both have existing pools of tech talent. They're also a world class cities that people want to move to and so here competing with other companies for talent and you can say. Come to. The Washington area Arlington Virginia come to New York City. Or come to Seattle we feel like we have a lot to offer potential and the giants. I gotta say Jay bell I've been getting emails all day long from colleagues in Chicago in Indianapolis and Pittsburgh who are saying. Of course we have talent here wiping Amazon she was asked if this is really about Hamlet. Well that it scale I mean at 50000 is a lot let me play for this in perspective and 25000 is a lot to. The average size of fortune a top fortune 500 companies top Tandy. Headquarters is about eleven or 121000. So each of these will be double the size of that average. Not counting the 46000. Folks we have here in Seattle so and were tech heavy company we need we need technology. Folks to to fill these positions in these corporate headquarters. And and there's a lot of competition for that talent so. This that the scale that this new York and Washington offer was important need. Pool of existing talent that the breadth and depth of that pool. And also you know there's there's there's no place like New York is no place like Washington when your when your. Trying to convince people. Come join you at Amazon. That's that's a real attraction. So it didn't feel like you could get this scale and these other cities when it comes to new York and Arlington when it turned out they were gonna split this between the two. Did any of the tax incentives that they originally offered come off the table. Well they were cut now. I mean that's that's how it works these are performance basis and senate widely available to any company that was pursuing this kind of investment. Nothing you know do a perfectly special about it for Amazon. And you know when we said you know parks are our floors going to be 45000 that a 50000. You do the incentive packages were reduced accordingly. And and in each case this is an you know pants now and I hope we deliver in the future this is we get the incentives only after we deliver on the job creation. And will be reporting that job creation. Every year in order to to after the incentives offered. I'd also point out that. Incentives were not the driving factor for us. It's very common practice cities across the country and across North America participated in this and you know all who had economic. Development offices in and put together. If proposals that included incentives but incentives weren't the most important if you if you look at some of the the proposals that cities have released publicly. You'll see that yes some places were offering to make significantly higher incentives. But we really focused on our talent needs and and the desirability of moving folks in new York and Washington. I think if we couldn't find them workable locally and that's why we citizens places. Amazon also Jay got its hands on a lot of very valuable data throughout this process. What the company planned to do with that information would be used in the future to target customers. This is a perplexing question because we're talking about publicly available information about city's economic growth. There education systems the transportation systems and the like this is not. In this is it. Is it just information says the kind of stuff that any company. Doing any kind of significant investment in any city would gather and find from publicly available sources so I. I think you know any company wanted to find out the information the kind of information that we found out could find it. We use about a hundred different metrics when we are looking at different criteria including housing transportation education. You know and and which we we look at surveys that are publicly available to various firms have done about. The desirability of locations where it young people coming out of college want to live that kind of thing all these all these bits of information went into. The decision we made but there's nothing you this is not. Valuable beyond what you can find publicly. But is there anything that you will use from this re search. To acquire new customers to target consumers with specific advertising now that you have this information I die. A again this is not this was information about like what is schools look like. What is the transportation grid look like what are the capacities you know what kind of investments will need to be made in order to common eight point 5000 additional employees you know how big is the airport what's the growth. Potential there what's the average education level how much. You know it may be you know universities having this season had a lot of universities but aren't heavily attacked vs cities that have you know compete universities with computer science departments. Or engineering school you know that that's the candidate we're talking about yourself I don't think it's really applicable this. To a business is it really was all about deciding muted at best location for to find employees and to attract employees. And finally. DC. Was it really necessary to hold this sweepstakes across the country. Well absolutely we began. With a completely open mind I promise you that I was in meetings with or CEO and founder Jeff. They is us consistently over the course of the year. And you know we deliberated a lot about different options and you know wasn't until recently we settled on the idea of splitting headquarters in that we came to the conclusion that the Washington area Arlington Virginia and in New York City where there are. Where our best options but there were a lot of great proposals we we you know we saw. Huge potential a lot of locations across the country especially in the twining. Locations that may a finalist list and in fact even during this process we've announced 6000 jobs. In cities they were part of the top morning but didn't make the final two itself that kind of growth is gonna continue I think it we've seen some feedback from places like Miami. Toronto and elsewhere where. And just being part of this process has. Elevated their visibility of those cities for the stability of potential places protect company investment. And that's been a plus for them and I think they've also seen how they can work together with all their stake what was in their cities to make. Those locations even more attractive for investments I think. I think there's a lot outside in this process also because we can we planned this out in the data publicly. Yeah we are now making these investments in new York and Virginia. In a way that we you know we can work with those communities. Knowing that we're going to create at least 45000 jobs in implication. And and and we in the communities can help address some of the effects of that growth. In the way this most beneficial to a community you know a lot of companies including Amazon here in Seattle you know they start small and they grow organically nobody would have predicted that Amazon. Would have 46000 employees in Seattle and they've launched in Jeffs arrives. Twenty some years ago. Now we know what we're going to be doing in new York and Washington and we can. Healthy communities plan accordingly and build out accordingly with transportation and education life.

Add John McCain as an interest to stay up to date on the latest John McCain news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nMcCain, who lost his battle to glioblastoma days before the state's primary in August, still played an outsize role in the race to fill Republican Sen. Jeff Flake's seat, political analysts said.\n\nThe latest example came when Democratic Senator-elect Kyrsten Sinema praised him in her acceptance speech Monday night.\n\n\"A few months ago, we lost a legend who exemplified that spirit and all the best of Arizona. His example shines a light on the way forward,\" Sinema said. She went on to call him \"irreplaceable\" and noted that \"it's up to us to carry on Sen. McCain's legacy.\"\n\nThat Sinema, an Arizona native who touted her political independence, would praise McCain after her victory didn't stand out to many. But what did stand out is that McCain\u2019s name was almost absent from the campaign that Sinema wound up winning. Critically, to many Republicans, GOP nominee Rep. Martha McSally appeared hesitant to praise McCain, a member of her own party, during the primaries. That may have had a lot to do with McSally's ties to President Donald Trump.\n\nRick Scuteri/AP\n\n\"McSally fully embraced the president and his agenda and his approach to governing and from the very beginning, Kyrsten Sinema, while not necessarily explicitly saying this, embraced the campaign theme that emphasizes moderation and cooperation along the lines of what Sen. McCain advocated,\" said Richard Herrera, a political science professor at Arizona State University.\n\nMcSally, who conceded to Sinema on Monday, once campaigned with the late Sen. McCain when she was running for Congress. But this time around, as she battled against two conservative Republicans in the primary, former Sheriff Joe Arpaio and former state senator Kelli Ward, she appeared to distance herself from McCain and his more centrist policies.\n\nAll three Republican candidates seemed to be regularly trying to outdo one another with their various ties to Trump. The president's longstanding tensions with McCain may explain their own decisions to distance themselves from the late senator and his legacy as a moderate Republican.\n\nMany saw that dynamic at work when McSally and Trump attended the Aug. 13 signing of the Defense Authorization Act, the full title of which is the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. Neither Trump nor McSally mentioned the senator at the event.\n\nThat prompted the ire of the senator's daughter, Meghan McCain, who wrote on Twitter that McSally's \"inability to even mention my father's name when discussing the bill named in his honor is disgraceful (just as it was with Trump) - I had such higher hopes for the next generation of leadership in my home state.\"\n\n.@RepMcSally 's inability to even mention my father's name when discussing the bill named in his honor is disgraceful (just as it was with Trump) - I had such higher hopes for the next generation of leadership in my home state. https://t.co/MC1qpDS2na \u2014 Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) August 16, 2018\n\nMeghan McCain revisited the Aug. 13 incident on \"The View\" Tuesday morning, the day after McSally conceded to Sinema.\n\n\"To say it didn't go over well with me and many Arizonans is putting it nicely,\" Meghan McCain said before adding, \"I don't think that's why she didn't win. This was a very close race for a lot of different reasons.\"\n\nFor her part, McSally did praise John McCain regularly after securing her primary win, and that praise picked up noticeably after his death on Aug. 25.\n\nDuring her primary night victory speech on Aug. 28, McSally called for a moment of silence in John McCain's honor, and remembered him as \"an American hero.\"\n\nShe recalled a memory of how he campaigned for her and made jokes about their shared military service.\n\nShe thanked him for \"taking his time to support a fellow fighter pilot who followed in his footsteps.\"\n\n\"I am forever grateful to have had the chance to know him to learn from him and even to work with him,\" she said in the speech.\n\nMcSally pays early tribute to McCain during her acceptance speech, sharing a personal story.

And many voters were going to the polls in Arizona with trying to pick the person most likely to hold the president accountable -- that accrued to Sinema\u2019s benefit,\" Dowd added.\n\nMark Salter, McCain's former speechwriter and longtime aide, commented on Twitter that the McCain brand of politics helped certain candidates win in the former senator's home state, including Gov. Ducey and Sinema.\n\n\"Trump, who barely won AZ two years ago, is even more disliked there now. Arizonans knew Trump\u2019s caravan of terrorist lepers was bullshit.

The virus mostly affects children and young adults. The CDC said they do not know why the condition is impacting these individuals, but many believe it is caused by viruses. The CDC emphasized it remains a rare condition and said there have been no reported deaths from AFM so far in 2018.\n\nCDC\n\nThe typical symptoms of AFM are similar to those of a severe respiratory illness, along with a fever, but then progress into neurological symptoms. Some patients with AFM feel weakness in their arms or legs, a loss of muscle tone or slower reflexes.\n\nSome patients may also exhibit facial droop or weakness, difficulty moving their eyes and drooping eyelids or difficulty with swallowing or slurred speech. The most severe symptom is respiratory failure.\n\nMessonnier said the CDC doesn't yet have enough information to definitively say what causes AFM and are casting a wide net for information. Part of that is studying the long-term health of AFM patients. Scientists are also looking for a pathogen in AFM patients' spinal fluid, but haven't yet found a pathogen that's a clear cause, she said.\n\nThe CDC said it sees an uptick in AFM cases every two years, and so far, the curve of the cases being investigated this year looks very similar to that of 2014 and 2016.\n\nOfficials don't expect many more cases in 2018 compared to 2016 and 2014, Messonnier said.\n\nThe best advice available is to wash your hands regularly, which lowers the chances of getting sick or spreading germs from many of the viruses linked to AFM, and protect against mosquito bites by using repellent, in addition to staying indoors at dusk and dawn.\n\nThe CDC said the vaccines your pediatrician suggests are very effective and children should continue to receive them on schedule even though there is no vaccine for AFM.", "Transcript for Country Music Awards Interview, Day 2: Brett Young\n\nShe did such a good job planning the wedding achieved.

The system automatically pushes the nose of the plane down.\n\nBut if that nose-down command is triggered by faulty sensor readings \u2014 as suspected in the Lion Air crash \u2014 pilots can struggle to control the plane, which can go into a dive and perhaps crash, according to a Boeing safety bulletin and safety regulators.\n\nThe bulletin included new details on how to stop a runaway series of events from leading to a crash, pilots say.\n\n\"It is something we did not have before in any of our training.

Very dry humidity three to only 8% so humidity in the single digits high wind warnings remain it is just. Not at this situation be fighting these fires right now huge challenge for firefighters and we often hear that turn of Santa Ana winds during times like this explain what that means. He has so anytime you talk about hires fest in Southern California talk about Santa Ana wind events this is the worst situation. To be battling these fires and this is what actually creates the rapid fire growth in the first place only when you have a high pressure situated for the creek basins over the central to southern Rocky Mountains it basically brings all of that air flow. Clockwise right directly straight into Southern California and ask those strong winds. New through the mountains they rush to those mountains it contrasts the warm they become even drier and the new threw it sixty to eighty miles per hour in toll eventually hit the canyons. And that's when you have really dry gusty winds beats at the funneling things. Sadly there the wins one helping to spread the spire to. Spreading them erratically because the winds sort of come and go in he's got some directions that you can't predict and they're making the atmosphere dryer which obviously. Does not how exactly all three of those things basically is creates the disaster that these fire and have conflict unfolded in California I'm not want you to hang out for second but I want over to Olivia Smith Olivia is actually in Southern California and like I said the fires are spread across a straight Olivia Anderson you're in Calabasas.

Everything else right across the street is our trees are Smart and they now are packing and act here profits at a home you know wind. Came over here. Yeah Olivia were looking at some footage of the flames you know in the general area firefighters trying desperately to fight them. And I mean it just looks like a nearly impossible task it's unbelievable to think what these people are going through. We really appreciate you being out there and you bringing us your story thank you. But. As Olivia Smith for us from Calabasas. You know and this is just the Southern California portion of that that was the Woolsey fire. Just one of several in Southern California right now and then of course in northern California the campfire has already become the deadliest in state. History. Lyndon. This is why we're seeing a state of emergency across the entire state of California. And again Mel you you talked about this but. That's one of the things we're seeing with these fires in both areas actually is that you'll see one home untouched and then you'll see an entire block devastated. I mean in their case they stayed to fight for their home but in many cases it's just because the wind. Com's and then goes so what can people expect. Looking ahead camp can these firefighters expect some help from eleven. Yet you mentioned on you know how you can see one home that is completely untouched and the other one just destroying a lot of that to do with how he Braddock these winds are and they can be moving one direction the wing going so fast that direction they completely shift direction. In a moment's notice and that's why they're so hard to fight these fires because of these erratic winds and because of how fast they are going but there is some good news on the way according to the winds is that it's going to be dying down each day so today we had extreme fire weather threats because of those high wind warnings. Tomorrow it goes down a level it goes down to critical. Fire weather threats in Southern California so we are seeing those winds starring Mickey trees and that's because that high pressure system is going to start weakening of pulling away from Southern California and so I tomorrow we're looking a little bit better situation we're still going to be seeing the dry. Gusty winds through tomorrow another standing in a win and then is expected all and not as severe tonight into tomorrow afternoon. Back after Wednesday that we're looking at each day getting a little bit better so even though the winds are going to be decreasing the so still could get some gossip in the next couple days the erratic and strong winds will. Be dying down and that conditions will be improving. But it's still going to be very dry it's still going to be very humid and we're not expecting rain for Southern California for at least the next week ransom mixed bag from the weather.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "After crisscrossing the country to bolster fellow Republicans, a Louisiana congressman who was shot at a congressional baseball practice last year squeezed in a publicity tour for his new book about his survival and recovery before returning to work in Congress.\n\nU.S. Rep. Steve Scalise did a flurry of television interviews about \"Back in the Game: One Gunman, Countless Heroes and the Fight For My Life\" before heading back to Capitol Hill for the first time since Democratic victories flipped control of the U.S. House, The Advocate reported .\n\nScalise's book, which comes out Tuesday, offers a moment-by-moment account of a gunman's June 2017 attack on the Republican congressional baseball practice in suburban Washington. A single rifle shot crushed Scalise's hip and did massive damage to his internal organs. The Jefferson Parish lawmaker spent months confined to a hospital, where infections repeatedly threatened his life. He endured intense physical therapy to relearn how to walk.\n\nScalise, 53, told the newspaper that visitors to his hospital room repeatedly suggested he should write an account of his survival. The congressman said he didn't take the proposition seriously until Utah Republican and best-selling author U.S. Rep. Chris Stewart urged him to consider it.\n\nAlong with a co-author, Scalise said he went back to interview some the people present at the baseball practice or involved in his recovery to get their versions of the story and piece back together everything that happened.\n\n\"In a lot of ways, it was therapeutic for me because it allowed me to relive the experience in a different way, from different perspectives that I didn't see,\" Scalise said.\n\nScalise squeezed in a brief publicity tour for the book between \"a really aggressive campaign season\" and returning to work in Congress.\n\nOne campaign he says he's not plotting: a 2019 race to challenge Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards. Scalise again denied any interest in running against Edwards, as he has multiple times over the past year.\n\nScalise is running unopposed for House minority whip, which would make him the No. 2 House Republican. That's a step up in party leadership but carries less legislative clout than his current job of House majority whip.\n\n\"We're already talking about what we've got to do to get the majority back and, in the meantime, what's going to be ahead with (Rep. Nancy) Pelosi (D-California) as speaker,\" said Scalise. He also suggested that cutting federal spending will now become a top priority with his party in the minority.\n\n\"I really think we need to go back and regain our mantle as the party of fiscal discipline because I do think we lost that over the last few years,\" said Scalise.", "Ohio authorities have made four arrests in connection with the murder of eight family members who were fatally shot \"execution style\" in 2016.\n\nAll four arrested belong to the same family from South Webster, Ohio, and were charged \"with planning and carrying out the murders,\" Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine announced in a press release.\n\nThe suspects were identified as George \"Billy\" Wagner III, 47; Angela Wagner, 48; George Wagner IV, 27; and Edward \"Jake\" Wagner, 26.

Many appeared to have been shot in their sleep, and one of the women was found lying in bed with a 4-day-old baby.\n\n\"All eight victims were killed in cold blood,\" DeWine said. \"They were shot in their own homes. They were brutally and viciously executed.\"\n\nThe 4-day-old was one of three children, along with a 6-month old and a 3-year-old, who were found unharmed at the three crime scenes, police said.\n\nOhio Attorney General/Pike County Sheriff\n\nDeWine accused the Wagners of spending months carefully planning the murder of the victims, who he characterized as friends of theirs. The Wagners \"studied the victims' habits and routines. They knew the layouts of their homes. They knew where they slept,\" DeWine said.\n\n\"The killers knew the territory and meticulously planned these horrendous murders,\" DeWine said.\n\nThe suspects allegedly purchased ammunition, a magazine clip, brass catchers and a bug detector in preparation for the crimes, authorities said.\n\nPike County Sheriff Charles Reader described the crime scenes as something he'll never be able to un-see.\n\n\"Images of the houses, the bodies, the scenes, I can never erase them,\" he told reporters Tuesday. \"Even 20 years of law enforcement experience cannot prepare you fully for a day like that.\"\n\nJohn Minchillo/AP Photo, FILE\n\nThe Wagners allegedly tampered with evidence after the murders were carried out, including cameras, a silencer, shell casings, parts of a home security system and the victims' cellphones, DeWine said. They face additional charges, including, conspiracy, engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, tampering with evidence, unlawful possession of a dangerous ordinance, aggravated burglary for allegedly breaking into the homes to carry out the murders, unauthorized use of property, obstruction of justice, interception of wire, oral or electronic communications and forgery for allegedly forging child custody documents, DeWine said.\n\nWhile DeWine did not discuss the motive of the murders, he said the custody of a young child \"plays a role in this case.\"\n\n\"They did this quickly, coldy, calmly and very carefully, but not carefully enough,\" Reader said.\n\nAndrew Welsh-Huggins/AP\n\nJake Wagner is also charged with unlawful sexual conduct with a minor for allegedly having sexual contact with Hanna May Rhoden when she was 15 years old and he was 20 years old, DeWine said. Jake Wagner is the father of Hanna May Rhoden's older daughter, who was staying with the Wagners on the night the homicides took place, DeWine said.\n\nThe mothers of both Angela Wagner and Billy Wagner, Rita Newcomb, 65, and Fredericka Wagner, 76, respectively, are also facing felony charges of obstructing justice and perjury for allegedly misleading authorities over the course of the investigation, DeWine said.

Billy Wagner was arrested in Kentucky, while Angela was arrested at her home, he said. Their two sons were arrested during a traffic stop, while their mothers were arrested at their homes as well.\n\nThe family members are currently being housed in separate facilities, Reader said.\n\nAuthorities had enough to charge the Wagners after discovering \"the last piece of significant physical evidence\" on Oct. 30 and completed an examination of the evidence on Nov. 7, DeWine said. The indictments were filed after authorities \"confirmed the existence of a homemade firearm suppressor believed to have been built by the suspects,\" DeWine said.\n\nDeWine described the newest evidence as the final piece of a \"thousand-piece puzzle,\" adding that he believes the killers have been caught and that no one else was involved in the murders.\n\nAndrew Welsh-Huggins/AP, FILE\n\nSince the murders, investigators have followed up on more than 1,100 tips, conducted 550 interviews, tested more than 700 pieces of evidence and served more than 200 subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, DeWine said.\n\nInvestigators also traveled \"thousands of miles to 10 separate states,\" including Alaska, where the Wagner family had moved before coming back to Pike County last spring, DeWine said.\n\nSome of the crime scenes had \"marijuana commercial grow operations,\" DeWine, who is now the governor-elect, said last year.\n\nThe case featured an \"undercurrent of drugs,\" but drugs were not necessarily the motive, DeWine said.\n\nABC News' Rachel Katz, Emily Shapiro and Jason Volack contributed to this report.", "bad url", "Transcript for Country Music Awards Interview, Day 2: Kelsea Ballerini\n\nI hopefully am humbled I'm also practical and IA I feel like the true we'll hopefully we'll be here Larry I feel like maybe it might be my year but is not this year it's not time for me.

It's also illegal to possess, sell or distribute shark fins in Hawaii, which was the first state in the nation to ban the pricey delicacy often used in Chinese soups.\n\nAt least 962 shark finds were founded in 13 pieces of luggage.

Another fisherman said he ate sharks on the boat and cut off the fins, according to court documents, and that he didn't want dead sharks to go to waste.\n\nAuthorities estimate that the 190 pounds (89 kilograms) of seized shark fins have a street value of between $6,695 and $57,850.\n\nA detention hearing is scheduled for the fishermen Tuesday.", "Transcript for Country Music Awards Interview, Day 2: Lauren Alaina\n\nWell I have to be realistic and I realize that in my category.

It has set up a de facto government in the Gaza Strip, where it is responsible for managing the daily lives of some 2 million Palestinians.\n\nIsrael, which along with its Western allies considers Hamas a terrorist group, joined with Egypt to impose a blockade on Gaza after the Hamas takeover, eviscerating the local economy. Jobs are hard to come by, Gaza's beaches are polluted by untreated sewage and tap water is undrinkable.\n\nThe blockade greatly restricts the movement of people out of the tiny territory, making it difficult to do business or travel abroad for work, school or family reasons.\n\nHamas wants Israel and Egypt to lift the blockade and it has led weekly protests since March aimed at busting it. Fueled in part by desperation, thousands have attended, with some burning tires, throwing rocks and grenades at Israeli troops and damaging the perimeter fence. More than 170 protesters have been killed by Israeli fire since the protests began.\n\nIsrael says it is defending its border against attackers. But it has come under heavy international criticism for the large number of unarmed people who have been shot.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nISRAEL\n\nIsrael, which withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005 after 38 years of occupation, says it has no choice but to enforce the blockade, accusing Hamas of trying to smuggle weapons into the territory.\n\nIsrael claims some credit for keeping border crossings open, allowing food, consumer goods and some construction materials to flow into the territory. It also has asked the international community, which already funnels hundreds of millions of dollars a year into Gaza, to increase aid.\n\nOver the years, Hamas has amassed a vast arsenal of rockets and other weapons which it has fired sporadically at Israeli communities along with other Gaza militants. Israel and Hamas have fought three wars, including one in 2014 that exposed a network of underground tunnels leading into Israel from Gaza, prompting Israeli accusations that Hamas uses material meant for Gaza's reconstruction for its war infrastructure.\n\nDespite its recognition that the economic situation in Gaza could lead to a humanitarian crisis, Israel says no political resolution can be reached so long as Hamas remains in power. Hamas has refused to disarm or disavow its opposition to Israel.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTHE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY\n\nCompounding the situation has been a yearslong rift between Hamas and Abbas' Fatah faction. Attempts to reconcile have repeatedly failed, leaving the Palestinians divided between rival governments in the West Bank and Gaza. The talks have repeatedly broken down over Hamas' refusal to disarm.\n\nAbbas is fearful of any political settlement that would separate Gaza from the West Bank and entrench Hamas rule.\n\nHe has slashed the salaries of thousands of former government workers in Gaza and cut fuel subsidies to pay for electricity, all in an effort to step up pressure on Hamas. He has also thwarted a series of internationally-backed initiatives aimed at rehabilitating Gaza, worried that they could help Hamas.\n\nThese measures, combined with the decade-long blockade, have sent Gaza's economy into freefall, prompting the increasingly desperate Hamas to step up the mass border protests.", "A Montreal man who told investigators that his \"mission was to kill and be killed\" was convicted of terrorism and other crimes Tuesday in the stabbing of a Michigan airport officer.\n\nIt was a slam dunk for federal prosecutors: Witnesses saw Amor Ftouhi attack Lt. Jeff Neville at the Flint airport in June 2017 and wrestled him to the ground.\n\nFtouhi, 53, was convicted of three crimes. He's a native of Tunisia who was living in Montreal at the time of the stabbing.\n\n\"This isn't a mystery. He was caught right there. He has the knife in his hand,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Cathleen Corken told jurors.\n\nInvestigators say Ftouhi wanted to stab Neville , take his gun and start shooting people in the airport. He legally drove into the U.S. at Champlain, New York, and arrived in Flint five days later. He tried but failed to buy a gun at a gun show and instead bought a large knife.\n\nWitnesses said he yelled, \"Allahu akbar\" \u2014 God is great \u2014 during the attack.\n\nNeville survived but has lost feeling in part of his face as a result of being stabbed in the neck.\n\n\"This is what a Muslim is born for,\" Ftouhi said in a handwritten note to his wife that was found in his apartment.\n\nFBI agent Shadi Elreda told jurors about his interview with Ftouhi after his arrest.

Linhardt said he would favor the adoption of rules that would reduce nitrogen oxide emissions but doubts that the administration wants to do that.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this administration and this leadership of the EPA do not fill us with much confidence that this will be a real air pollution reduction measure,\" Linhardt said.\n\nPaul Billings of the American Lung Association said he thinks the idea is encouraging but depends on exactly what the proposal looks like.\n\n\"The devil's always in the details,\" Billings said. \"If they were not to tighten the (nitrogen oxide) standards, it'd be a bait-and-switch.\"\n\nNitrogen oxides can worsen existing lung disease, contribute to the development of asthma and increase susceptibility to respiratory infections.\n\nSince the emissions regulations were last updated in 2000, regulatory requirements have been added piecemeal, resulting in what Wheeler calls \"overly complex and costly\" requirements that don't benefit the environment. The goal of the regulatory change would be to root out inefficiencies and perhaps use onboard diagnostic computers to ensure compliance over the life of trucks, Wheeler said.\n\nThe share of overall pollution contributed by heavy trucks has grown over the years, especially in urban areas and port cities with significant truck traffic, said Bill Wehrum, assistant administrator of the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation.\n\nWehrum said the EPA doesn't have a proposed target for setting new nitrogen oxide standards because it's at the beginning of a rule-making process. He said vehicles are now tested for emissions on a treadmill-like dynamometer, which might not capture all high-emissions phases of engine operation. The new standards could cut emissions during high-pollution phases, he said.\n\nCalifornia already is working on more stringent heavy truck emissions standards, and new federal standards could conflict with them. Wehrum said the EPA isn't drawing up its own standards to set up a confrontation with California, and it will work with the state on the new regulation.\n\nThe EPA's plan to freeze passenger vehicle fuel economy standards at 2020 levels would relax a regulation enacted at the end of the Obama administration. But that plan already has touched off a legal fight with California and about a dozen other states that follow its rules. California wants the requirements to become progressively more stringent through 2026.\n\nFor now, the U.S. and California standards match, and the auto industry fears they could be split in two, forcing them to make costly design changes for California and the other states.\n\nThe EPA is still considering the light-vehicle standards. Its preferred option would freeze them so the fleet would be required to average 30 miles a gallon in real-world driving from 2021 to 2026.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP writer Ellen Knickmeyer contributed from Washington.", "When Jude Law met with J.K. Rowling about portraying the younger version of Albus Dumbledore, the two discussed how to rebuild the fan-favorite character from the \"Harry Potter\" films.\n\nLaw spent an afternoon jotting down notes from Rowling who talked to him about Dumbledore's life before becoming the world's most powerful wizard. The British actor walked away with a vote of confidence from the famed author, alleviating some pressure on him.\n\n\"When the boss says 'I like you,' it gives you a little bit of comfort,\" Law said of Rowling, screenwriter of the \"Harry Potter\" prequel series that is based on her 2001 book \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\" ''You can't help but step into something like this, playing a part like this without feeling a sense of responsibility, a fear of letting someone down. But when the creator gives you the thumbs up, it's a blessing.\"\n\nDumbledore was a Hogwarts headmaster in the \"Potter\" franchise commonly known for his silver hair and long beard, sporting a loose robe. He was played by Michael Gambon after inheriting the role from the Richard Harris, who died in 2002.\n\nLaw's youthful version enters in his mid-40s wearing a three-piece suit with short auburn hair in the sequel \" Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald ,\" which will be released Friday. It's the second part of a five-film franchise that started with 2016's \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\" which grossed $813 million worldwide.\n\nIn \"Grindelwald,\" Law's character works with his former student Eddie Redmayne's Newt Scamander to thwart the divisive wizard leader Gellert Grindelwald, played by Johnny Depp. The film also stars Katherine Waterston, Zoe Kravitz and Ezra Miller.\n\nFor research, Law read several Harry Potter books that referenced Dumbledore, rather than solely watching the previous films featuring the elder character. With the help of Rowling and director David Yates, they wanted to build from the \"ground up.\"\n\n\"I was then given the opportunity to create him without feeling the pressure to mimic or impersonate or indeed hang the character too much on past representations by the other actors,\" Law said. \"There were certain traits I wanted to include. I loved his humor, the twinkle he had. He sees the good in almost everyone. He has a good heart. But I was able to layer him up a little more.\"\n\nRedmayne said the studio perfectly cast Law as Dumbledore, who doesn't necessarily show his true powers and appears only in about six scenes \u2014 most of which are interactions with Scamander.\n\n\"Being a formidable, formidable actor with great gravitas and weight and yet at the same time, he has this kind of playful quality,\" Redmayne said of Law. \"And I'll never forget our first scene, which was the first time we see each other in the film. I just saw his back, basically. And the way he turned around, it was instant. It was like in one look, he had managed to inhabit that. I hadn't had any expectations about Dumbledore. But somehow it was solidified in one look.\"\n\nThe sequel picks up after Grindelwald was captured by the Magical Congress of the United States of America with the aid of Newt at the end of the first film. But the villainous wizard finds a way to escape custody and assembles a group of pureblood wizards who support him to rule over all humans in 1920s Paris.\n\nLaw says the film opens the door to many dramatic paths and explores a more troubled time in Dumbledore's life along with his once-close relationship with Grindelwald.\n\nRowling announced in 2007 that Dumbledore is gay after the release of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows,\" the final book in the series. Some on social media criticized the author's decision to unveil and tinker with the beloved character's sexuality, but she has defended her actions.\n\nLaw assures the story is more focused on his character's complicated relationship with Grindelwald from decades ago, rather than Dumbledore's sexuality.\n\n\"His sexuality doesn't define him, but the relationship with Grindelwald does,\" Law said. \"I believe, and (Rowling) would agree, that Albus had many intimate relationships. And the one he has is the love of his life, which is damaged. It becomes even poisonous and sends the two of them in opposite directions. He's now in his middle age, around my age 45, and he's still recovering from a relationship that he's trying to work out from when he was 20. That's a long time. I could barely remember what life was like when I was 20.\"\n\nThe actor applauded Rowling for being fearless in creating \"layered\" and \"diverse\" characters such as Dumbledore in a fantasy world with \"escapism and magic.\"\n\n\"Isn't it wonderful that we're in a world where finally, finally a franchise like this has a great character and it doesn't matter. But (Rowling) is brave enough to put it out there and say 'Let's do this.' People should be able to handle this. They can. It's as we should be.\"\n\nLaw called his introduction as Dumbledore a good \"warmup\" as the franchise progresses. The actor has a few big films ahead on his plate including \"Captain Marvel\" and \"Vox Lux,\" but is looking forward to filming the third installment of \"Fantastic Beasts\" next summer.\n\nIt'll give Law time to grow his beard.\n\n\"Finding all those pieces of him were fun\" he said. \"I eased into the part, but the line was drawn at the end of this one.

He was convicted in 1994 for the murder of Andy Ascher, 22, during a robbery in Rockford, but last year Pursley, 52, won a new trial because ballistic testing proved the gun prosecutors used as evidence was not the homicide weapon.\n\nThe allegations against police arose after Ascher's mother informed prosecutors a detective said to her after Pursley's first trial that investigators never found the gun used to kill her son. She told prosecutors about the information last year after a judge ordered a new trial, but it was not disclosed to Pursley's attorneys until days before the retrial was set to begin.\n\nNow, prosecutors and the Rockford police department must turn over all paper and electronic records that mention Pursley's case by Dec. 20, when an evidentiary hearing is scheduled. Pursley's attorneys have also asked for the personnel records of the detectives who investigated Ascher's death\n\nBut, in the meantime, defense lawyers want the case dismissed, citing misconduct by police and prosecutors.\n\n\"His life should not continue to be hijacked by their misconduct,\" Andrew Vail, one of Pursley's attorneys, argued in court.\n\nAssistant state attorney James Brun agreed to the investigation into whether the detective's statement to Ascher's mother is true, but he pushed back on the request to dismiss the case entirely.\n\n\"The credibility of the statement needs to be determined before the court makes an appropriate ruling,\" Brun said.\n\nRockford police spokeswoman Laura Madher did not immediately return a call for comment.\n\nPursley spent years representing himself during his prison sentence and successfully lobbied state lawmakers to pass legislation that would allow him to use the Integrated Ballistic Identification System to retest the shell casings used to prosecute him.

It felt like an earthquake,\" she recalled Tuesday, a hospital identity tag still wrapped around her wrist. \"The electricity went out and we didn't know whether to go up or down. I was hysterical.\"\n\nIt was the first lethal rocket attack from Gaza in years, and yet the only fatality was a Palestinian laborer from the West Bank. Two Israeli women were critically wounded.\n\nIn just 24 hours, Gaza militants fired more than 450 rockets and mortar shells into southern Israel, the most serious escalation since a 50-day war between Israel and Hamas in 2014. Israel responded with a wave of airstrikes it said targeted militants.\n\nResidents angrily demanded the government restore calm for good, even if that means another war. Yet many people wearily expressed a sense of helplessness, as successive governments fail to come up with an effective policy to bring quiet to the Israel-Gaza frontier.\n\nHamas militants seized Gaza in 2007, triggering an Israeli-Egyptian border blockade that has choked the territory of 2 million people. Israel refuses to lift the blockade unless Hamas disarms, a demand the militants refuse. The volatile standoff has produced repeated rounds of violence, including indiscriminate Gaza rocket fire at Israeli border towns.\n\nWord late Tuesday that Gaza militants agreed to a cease-fire was unlikely to sway people's minds that there is no long-term solution to the Gaza conundrum.\n\n\"I don't know how you stop this thing. Nothing helps. Whatever you do it always comes back,\" said Shlomit Hayat, 38.\n\nShe noted that the deadly violence came just days after Israel allowed Qatar to deliver $15 million in cash to Gaza to alleviate its economic hardship and after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he'd do everything he can to prevent an \"unnecessary\" war.\n\nThe latest fighting was triggered by a botched Israeli raid into Gaza on Sunday that set off clashes resulting in the deaths of seven Palestinian militants, including a local Hamas commander, and a senior Israeli military officer. Palestinian militant groups said the rocket barrage was a message to Israel that such incursions have a cost.\n\nGazans have similar fears when fighting breaks out. While Israel says it has confined its airstrikes to military targets, hundreds of Palestinian civilians have been killed in the three previous wars. For many in Gaza, the latest outbreak of fighting brought back fears that no place is truly safe in the densely populated territory.\n\nOn Tuesday, an Israeli airstrike destroyed a six-story residential building in the Rimal neighborhood of Gaza City that housed a kindergarten on its ground floor. Israel said the building was used by Hamas for military purposes \u2014 a charge denied by residents.\n\n\"All the people here are civilians, children and families,\" said Mamdouh al-Shurafa, a building resident. \"When we are bombed in the middle of the city, where can we go?\"\n\nIsrael and Hamas have fought three wars since the group seized Gaza from the internationally-backed Palestinian Authority in 2007. In the most recent war, over 2,200 Palestinians were killed, more than half of them civilians, and tens of thousands were left homeless. Seventy-three people, most of them soldiers, were killed on the Israeli side.\n\nIsrael's Iron Dome rocket-defense system and advanced warning networks have provided a large degree of protection from the rockets, which killed some 30 civilians in the decade prior to the 2014 war. Casualties have dropped considerably since then and a proliferation of rocket-proof safe rooms in newer buildings has allowed many Israelis to feel much safer in their own homes.\n\nBut this week's onslaught showed the system is not foolproof. The overnight rocket that slipped through penetrated the roof of a four-story apartment building, leaving the entire structure pockmarked, its windows blown out and the balcony shutters hanging limply.\n\nEmergency forces evacuated a critically wounded woman to hospital. Only an hour later, a neighbor sifting through the rubble discovered the other wounded woman and the dead man. \"I heard a murmur and then I saw a hand reach out,\" said Shlomi Lankry.\n\nRelatives in the West Bank town of Halhoul identified the dead man as 48-year-old Mahmoud Abu Asbeh. A married father of six, he would typically sleep in Ashkelon during the week and return home for weekends.\n\n\"The rockets don't have eyes to see, they hit randomly, and this happened randomly, it was unintentional,\" said his father, Abdel Hamid Abu Asbeh. \"Last night he told me the rockets are falling like rain.

Some states restrict sales to 21 and older.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb responded to Juul's announcement on Twitter.\n\n\"We're deeply concerned about the epidemic of youth use of e-cigs,\" he said. \"Voluntary action is no substitute for regulatory steps #FDA will soon take. But we want to recognize actions by JUUL today and urge all manufacturers to immediately implement steps to start reversing these trends.\"\n\nLast week, an FDA official said the agency plans to bar stores and gas stations from selling most flavored e-cigarettes, but not menthol. It also plans to require online retailers to verify ages, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nJuul said it will keep selling mint and menthol in stores because those flavors mirror what is in traditional cigarettes.\n\nVaping products have grown into a $4 billion market in the U.S. However, there's been little research on their long-term effects and debate persists about how helpful they are in helping smokers quit or avoid cigarettes\n\nThe FDA has been targeting the San Francisco-based Juul. In April, the agency issued warnings to retailers about sales to children. The FDA also asked Juul Labs to turn over documents about the devices' design and marketing, and in September made an unannounced visit to Juul headquarters to look for evidence.\n\nIt's not just Juul. Last month, the FDA sent letters to 21 other e-cigarette companies seeking information that might help the agency determine if those companies have been marketing products illegally.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Oh, if it was only still that easy. Take a look. People are sacrificing for you. And I'm not sacrificing? Should I sacrifice my privacy? My self-respect? Hm? Then it won't just be me who gets dragged down. Those kids that run another campaign or someone who don't have that account for who comes and goes from their bedroom and that is just the beginning. We're not talking about that right now. I am talking about that. We're talking about how you get through today without pissing away everything we have worked for on this campaign. This campaign is about the future, not rumors, not sleaze. I care about the sanctity of this whether you do or do not. Mm-hmm. Please welcome the fabulous Hugh Jackman and director of \"The front runner,\" Jason Reitman. Come on, you guys. ?????? Oh, yeah. Happy birthday. Thank you, sweetie. Another year. You're clearly not into it at all. Don't mention it. You know. Listen I said earlier that for me, birthdays are -- I celebrate them for the people who didn't get to be my age. So I feel like if you are above ground, you should be celebrating. And actually, Hugh, you celebrated a big birthday. The big 5-0. I did. We have that in common. I just celebrated my 50th, and you had a big celebrity-studded party, but the one headline that came out is that you have been longtime friends with ivanka and Jared Kushner. Yeah. Yep. And they were there, and you have been able to maintain your friendship by not talking about politics. Is that the secret? Well, yeah. I mean, I have known them for 15 years. Deb and I have known them, and we have a similar group of friends. They have always been so kind and generous and I can tell you handwritten letters that ivanka wrote, and kindness. And so, you know, people question, oh, really? I'm, like, okay. Let's say your friends of 15 year's father became president. Whether you agree with the politics or not, do you just dump your friends? I'm, like, no. You don't. I don't understand that. Not a real friend. I love that. That's good. So Jason -- Yes. Which friends of mine are you about to bring up? All of them. Let's go. You wrote and directed this movie, and I just want to say it is really nice to see you because, you know, you have been doing amazing work over the years and I just -- we have not really met yet, and I just want to tell you I love what you do. I'm really proud of you. I don't know what to say. Thank you. You directed this, and this is a sex scandal that brought down Gary hart's campaign 30 years ago, but you say it's a movie kind of how people -- looking at politics today. Yeah, well, I think there is all this connective tissue with that story and what is happening today. I feel like I'm like everyone here. We all have the same morning routine. We wake up, open our phone, open up the news app and go, wait, what? And we're all trying to figure out how the hell we got here, and I can't help but look at the story and see the kind of seeds, you know, threads that you pull on to get us here. Gary hart's story is almost quaint compared to trump. I mean, one little scandal and he has a girl in his lap, et cetera, you know? This is really remarkable, you know, he has 16 women accusing him of -- plus a porn star and plus another woman when says -- this should have brought him down and did not. It's so hard to have that conversation in 2018. The volume is at a 12. You go on Twitter and say one wrong thing and get your head ripped off. What's nice about a story from 1987 is that you can kind of bring the volume down a little and actually have a conversation about gender politics, about the line between a public and a private life, you know, the relationship between politicians and journalists. All these things we're trying to talk about. A lot of people -- it's funny you say that. Brought it down, because he chose to leave and that's something that Gary always said to me. He chose to leave at this point. It's not like he was forced out. He could see where things were going, and Meghan, you obviously know Gary well. He was one of my father's pal bearers. Is it interesting to spend time with a real life person that you have to portray? It's nerve-racking and interesting and he is an incredibly smart guy. He is described as one of the smartest politicians over the last 50 years and he is so switched on. He can talk to you about any subject. He is an envoy to the northern islands recently, and there are so many things he has done, that when you get off the plane and you are there and Gary hart is there curbside to pick you up and you're in his house, you know, that's the moment of reckoning when you realize, okay. We are portraying the worst three weeks of his life, and six months from now he is going to see the movie, and it really becomes real then. I wanted him to know how seriously we took it. It's his story. It's not just his story, but Donna rice's story, and the campaign workers. It's everybody's story. It's everybody's story. Did he give his opinion about it? I brought the movie to Denver to show him and his wife and that's the most terrifying screening of my life. Scarier than when I showed my father, and I brought it to Denver and they walked out and the first thing they said was, Hugh Jackman is such a good actor. It's a great movie and it's so -- I saw the film last night. I thought it was very respectful of their relationship because -- and the troubles that ensued from the perhaps affair. I thought it was well done. As a man, it was very protective as you saw in the clip, protective of the political process, protective of his family, and the thing he was most nervous about was how his family was portrayed and he told me on the phone, please tell Vera how amazing she was as Lee. They are still married and his wife is the strongest woman that he has ever met. They have been married for how long? 60. You can see in the film it was so well done. Incredible. I want to ask you about this because we have a fun, light note. An ongoing feud with Ryan Reynolds. He took out a negative smear campaign ad against you. Spent a lot of money on it. And put out details about you. Consider these facts. Hugh Jackman isn't his real name. It's Hugh Michael Jackson. Hugh Michael spokes with a charming accent, but he is from Milwaukee. Is this the type of amazing actor and nice person we want delivering a preachy speech this award season? Or maybe there is a foreigner of a bordering country who would really like it. Think before you vote. I'm coming for you, man. I'm coming for you. Well, you should. Lucky to find a handsome actor to play a handsome politician. I'm lucky he said yes. He was known for his generosity, decency and work ethic and all of that turned out to be 100% true. He is the best. I want to just point out you also lucked out because this one makes great films. He makes great films. Why don't we make a movie together? I would watch. You -- I'm, you know, look. You just -- you are your own person and I love that. Your dad was extraordinary, but you are your own person. That's the nicest thing you could say. You make the things that you make and you're good. You know, thank you. They're all movies about real people going through real problems. I think he is great. He is amazing. I'm sorry. Our thanks to you. Thank you. \"The front runner\" is in select theaters now and will open nationwide November 21st. If you don't know the story, go see it. If you do know the story, go see it because you don't know as much as you think you do.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Transcript for Democrat Kyrsten Sinema makes history in Arizona\n\nAnd, you know, Kirsten Sinema has reason to celebrate because she just became the first democratic senator of Arizona elected and she said it's not just a victory for Arizona and she also knows she has some huge shoes to fill. Take a look. Arizona rented what has become far too common in our country. Name-calling, petty, personal attacks and doing and saying whatever it takes just to get elected. It's dangerous, and it lessens who we are as a country. Senator McCain is irreplaceable, but his example will guide our next steps forward. He taught us to always assume the best in others, to seek compromise instead of sowing division and to always put country ahead of party. You know? Wow. I mean, the Democrat is revoking the Republican name. It's the Republican name that's the barrier, the height of where we have to start. This is interesting for a lot of different reasons and I'm so excited who I finally know who any senator is. The first woman senator from Arizona. First Democrat since 1976, since before I was born in Arizona. It's really interesting. She is the first openly bisexual senator ever. Was that part of the campaign? Openly. And religious. She ran in congress, and she was very far left and moderated. She came out supporting sending troops to the border. She wasn't supportive of president trump, but wouldn't knock his supporters. Running against Martha mcsally, and what's interesting about her, is after she won the primary, she went with president trump and signed the defense bill which was named in honor of my father and refused to say my father's name. To say it didn't go over well with me and many arizonans is putting it nicely. It was close for a lot of reasons, but I hope she continues -- kyrstey Sinema as the moderate Democrat she ran on. It's a good day in Arizona and I'm touched she decided to invoke my father. Well, yeah. Because, you know, you can't talk about Arizona without talking about your dad, and that bar and very, very high. Arizona is now purple which is fascinating as well, ands the it's not full trump country. I think people sometimes think Arizona is full trump. He only won by 3%, and my father won by 14 points. It's an independent, civically-minded group of arizonans who take their right to vote very seriously and I think going forward into the general, if you think Arizona is locked and loaded for trump, be wary. This is a sign. The woman took her oath of all of a sudden not on the bible, but on the constitution. There you go. Also 2.1 million Latinos live in Arizona. Yes. A lot of them came out to vote and this is a very different demographic and I think Sinema's campaign was smart in coming out and reaching to the Latino community because that's a big part of Z. -- Arizona. That's a great point. A third of the demographic in Arizona are Latino. There is not a demographic trend today that benefits the Republican party. It doesn't look like the trump rallies and what happened in Arizona should be a lesson going forward. You have to represent the changing demographics. Is that what they keep wanting to stop the vote count? They're having trouble winning? Let's talk about that. I wanted to point out though also -- Fought well done by Martha mcsally. The first time, two women running for senate. It's historical. She was a woman, the rival, who you are talking about sending a very gracious concession speech as well. With her dog. I think one of the things that we may be seeing is a B.S. Fatigue. I think people may not appreciate the name-calling -- I think people are just getting tired of it and because nothing is getting done and people are just going, let's move forward. So congratulations. I hope that -- I hope it is a good time for the folks in Arizona because it's going to be brand-new. Selfishly, I would love to have Kyrsten on the show. Come on.

But the ticket owner has still not come forward to claim the prize some three weeks later.\n\nBrendan McDermid/Reuters\n\n\"We have not heard that the winner in South Carolina has come forward,\" Seth Elkin, a spokesperson for Maryland Lottery and Gaming, told ABC News.\n\nAlong with Delaware, Kansas, Maryland, North Dakota, Ohio and Texas, South Carolina law allows a winner to stay anonymous if he or she wishes, according to Maryland Lottery and Gaming.\n\nThe winner has 180 days since the day the ticket was purchased to come forward to claim the prize.\n\nTony Cooper, the chief operating officer with the South Carolina Education Lottery, advised the winner to sign the back of the lottery ticket, keep it in a safe place and seek a reliable financial advisor.\n\nThe winner can take either a cash-out option and receive a lump sum of approximately $878 million, or choose the annuity and receive $1.586 billion over the course of 30 years.\n\nThe $1.5 Mega Millions jackpot caused lottery fever across the country last month as individuals and groups snapped up tickets in the hopes of scoring the ultimate prize.\n\nThe owner of the shop where the ticket was purchased and the state will also receive a windfall from the lucky ticket as well.\n\nThe winning ticket, which had the correct combination for the $1.586 billion jackpot, was sold at KC Mart in Simpsonville, South Carolina, where stores receive 1 percent of the value of a winning ticket for any prize over $10,000.\n\nThe shop\u2019s owner, C.J. Patel, will receive $50,000, which is the maximum share of the money that can be received by the owner of a store that sold a winning jackpot ticket.", "As Amazon turns its attention to setting up new homes in Long Island City, New York and Arlington, Virginia, experts and historians in Seattle say both places can expect a delicate relationship with the world's hottest online retailer.\n\nThe communities will be subject to outsized influence from a company used to getting what it wants and unfazed by blame, fairly or not, for widespread changes all around.\n\nJust look to the Pacific Northwest, where both Amazon and Seattle have transformed dramatically together and sometimes at odds over the past 24 years, prompting resentment among a certain crowd of wistful \"mossback\" natives.\n\nBut there is a key difference.\n\nThe New York city and DC-area picks allow the company to strategically sidestep and diffuse many of the growing pains Amazon has been accused of inflicting on its Seattle hometown. That's because the pending moves will shift Amazon from the \"MVP\" employer role it plays here, to a mere \"VIP\" employer position in two of America's largest, most robust locales.\n\nA Fitch Ratings analysis notes that 25,000 Amazon jobs would amount to less than 1 percent of the labor force in either New York's or DC's metropolitan statistical area. Both also already have a large concentration of personal incomes in the six-figure bracket.\n\nIn Seattle, Amazon's workforce has grown from 5,000 to 45,000 employees since 2010, while its physical footprint in the downtown core grew from 1 million to 8 million square feet today.\n\nMatthew Gardner, chief economist with the Windermere Real Estate company in Seattle, estimates that Amazon's crew of highly-educated, well-paid techies makes up about 15 percent of downtown Seattle's total workers.\n\nAmazon says it spent $4 billion developing its Seattle home after claiming the once-sleepy South Lake Union warehouse district that's unofficially rebranded \"Amazonia\" because of the company's 44-building (and counting) development spree.\n\nThe company says it has infused $38 billion into the city's economy between 2010 and 2016.\n\nThe downtown core today is a bustling employment center that is complemented with extra bus routes subsidized by Amazon, which claims half of its employees walk, bike or take public transit to work.\n\nThe area is also buoyed by blue-badged Amazon workers having lunch in small local eateries and food trucks outside. The Downtown Seattle Association said more than 2,000 small businesses have opened in downtown Seattle since Amazon showed up.\n\nThat's also meant a steady blockade of construction work in pockets of downtown, which also coincides with major traffic congestion caused by two long-overdue public transportation projects on Interstate 5 and Highway 99. Critics also lament Seattle's metamorphosis from a modest blue-collar region fueled by timber, fishing and factory jobs, to the city's status as a star tech hub that was cemented by Amazon and then drew Facebook and Google to set up key outposts here.\n\nSeattle's new concentration of highly-educated, well-paid techies infused in a post-Great Recession era has contributed to a vicious housing market. As a majority of them are young and single renters, Gardner said average city rents have increased by more than 70 percent since 2010, to nearly $2,000 a month. Meanwhile, the average cost of a single-family house has increased by nearly 90 percent to an average price of $844,000.\n\nThe tension around Amazon's growth hit a peak this year as the city struggled to address its homelessness crisis. Amazon successfully fought a proposed city tax that would have helped fund more services. Local officials quickly bowed down to the city's top employer after Amazon threatened to pull development projects. The bitter battle further bruised CEO and founder Jeff Bezos' \"corporate citizen\" reputation and also overshadowed the growing, though relatively small portfolio of philanthropy Amazon has done in the city for homelessness.\n\nFor the first two decades in existence, Amazon.com's business blossomed quietly in Seattle, starting as a literary dot-com darling and expanding into the \"Everything Store.\" In fact, Amazon in 1994 was warmly embraced by a city proud of its innovative legacy tied to Boeing and Microsoft, but also committed to being an affordable, creative enclave out West.\n\nIt's in the last five years that the acceleration of change has been so intense that the growing pains between Amazon and Seattle have been stark and visceral.\n\nKnute Berger, a longtime Seattle columnist who has chronicled the city from a native perspective, recalls the days when Amazon hired local journalists and writers to produce high-quality content to help sell books on its platform. But Amazon's widespread success was later seen as a threat on traditional bookstores and print publishing on the whole.\n\n\"At some point, they crossed the line from being a creative dot-com to 'The Man,'\" Berger said.\n\nWith all of this in the rearview and looking forward to its new headquarter cities, Margaret O'Mara, a tech industry historian and University of Washington professor, said there's an opportunity for an Amazon fresh start. She urged the company to forge a new path as a community-conscious tech giant who will support local taxes as needed.\n\n\"Building a neighborhood that's a really great place to be a tech employee but not built for anyone else, from a city's perspective, it's not the kind of sustainable development you want to have,\" O'Mara said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Sally Ho on Twitter: https://twitter.com/\u2014SallyHo", "bad url", "Authorities arrested a family of four Tuesday in the gruesome 2016 slayings of eight people from another family in rural Ohio, a crime that prosecutors suggested stemmed from a custody dispute.\n\nThe announcement marked the culmination of a massive investigative effort that began after seven adults and a teenage boy were found shot in the head at four separate homes in April 2016. The killings terrified local residents and spawned rumors that it was a drug hit.\n\nOhio Attorney General Mike DeWine said a grand jury indicted the four on aggravated murder charges and they could be sentenced to death if convicted. DeWine gave scant detail about why the victims were killed, but he said the custody of a young child played a role. He added that the accused had carefully planned the murders for months.\n\n\"There certainly was an obsession with custody, obsession with control of children,\" DeWine said.\n\nThose indicted were Edward \"Jake\" Wagner, 26, his father George \"Billy\" Wagner III, 47; Billy Wagner's wife, 48-year-old Angela Wagner and George Wagner, 27. The four lived near the scenes of the massacre about 60 miles (97 kilometers) south of Columbus and had long been considered chief suspects, DeWine said.\n\n\"They did this quickly, coldly, calmly, and very carefully. But not carefully enough,\" said Pike County Sheriff Charles Reader. \"They left traces. They left a trail.\"\n\nThe victims were Jake Wagner's longtime former girlfriend, 19-year-old Hanna Rhoden, who shared custody of their daughter, her parents, siblings and other relatives. Rhoden had been in bed with her newborn when she was killed. The baby wasn't hurt.\n\nA coroner said all but one of the victims was shot more than once, including two people shot five times and one shot nine times. Some also had bruising, consistent with the first 911 caller's description of two victims appearing to have been beaten.\n\n\"I just might tell you this is just the most bizarre story I've ever seen in being involved in law enforcement,\" said DeWine, who was elected governor earlier this month.\n\nA lawyer for the Wagner family maintained their innocence.\n\n\"We look forward to the day when the true culprits will be discovered and brought to justice for this terrible tragedy,\" the lawyer, John Clark, said in a statement Tuesday. \"The Wagners are also very hopeful that in the ensuing months there will be a thorough vetting of all the facts.\"\n\nDeWine and Reader said Tuesday that the Wagners studied the layouts of the victims' properties, as well as their habits, routines, sleeping locations and pets. The indictments accuse the Wagners of tampering with phones, cameras, a gun silencer, shell casings and parts of a home security system.\n\nDeWine said there was \"absolutely no evidence\" anyone else was involved.\n\nInvestigators scrambling to determine who targeted the Rhoden family and why conducted over 130 interviews and processed over 100 pieces of evidence and 550 tips, with assistance from more than 20 law enforcement agencies. The last significant piece of evidence was collected Oct. 30, DeWine said.\n\nFirst mention of the suspects came in June of 2017, when authorities announced they were seeking information about the Wagners, including details on their personal and business interactions, and conversations people may have had with them.\n\nNone was named a suspect at the time. Investigators also said they had searched property in southern Ohio sold by the Wagners.\n\nBoth Jake Wagner and Angela Wagner told the Cincinnati Enquirer that they were not involved in the April 2016 killings. Angela Wagner said what happened was devastating and Hanna Rhoden had been like a daughter to her. She said that her husband, Billy, and Christopher Rhoden Sr., one of the victims, had been more like brothers than friends.\n\nThe Wagner family lived in Peebles, Ohio, at the time of the killings but later moved to Alaska, returning in the spring.\n\nPike County Prosecutor Rob Junk cautioned that the case could last several years, and it's possible the trial relocated because of the publicity.\n\n\"This has been so long coming. Thank God!\" Verlina Jarrell, of Circleville, Ohio, co-administrator of a Facebook page about the \"Pike County massacres\" with some 650 members, told The Associated Press.\n\nThe victims were 40-year-old Christopher Rhoden; his ex-wife, 37-year-old Dana Rhoden; their three children, 20-year-old Clarence \"Frankie\" Rhoden, 16-year-old Christopher Jr., and 19-year-old Hanna; Frankie Rhoden's fianc\u00e9e, 20-year-old Hannah Gilley; Christopher Rhoden Sr.'s brother, 44-year-old Kenneth Rhoden; and a cousin, 38-year-old Gary Rhoden. Hanna Rhoden's days-old baby girl, another baby and a young child were unharmed.\n\nAuthorities said marijuana growing operations were found at three of the four crime scenes. While that's not uncommon in this corner of Appalachia, it stoked rumors that the slayings were drug-related.\n\nDeWine said \"there's an undercurrent of drugs\" in the case, but there's no evidence the killings were related to drugs. He wouldn't elaborate.\n\nPolice in Kentucky say the FBI tracked \"Billy\" Wagner to Lexington, where he was arrested without incident at around 12:30 p.m. Tuesday. Lexington police weren't sure if he had been living in the area.\n\nThe mothers of Angela Wagner and \"Billy\" Wagner also were arrested in Ohio and charged with misleading investigators.\n\nJake Wagner was also charged with unlawful sexual conduct with a minor for having sexual contact with Rhoden when she was 15 years old and he was 20 years old, DeWine's office said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWelsh-Huggins reported from Columbus.

This study showed that patients who received a wish were 2.5 times more likely to have fewer unplanned hospital admissions and 1.9 times more likely to have fewer unplanned emergency department visits compared to patients of similar age, gender, disease category, and disease complexity who would also quality for a wish but did not receive one. (The study's first author, Dr. Anup Patel, is a member of the Medical Advisory Council for the non-profit Make-A-Wish Foundation. A list of all board members can be found here.)\n\nAnd, a higher percentage of \"wish kids\" achieved a decrease in healthcare costs after their wish was granted, compared to those children who did not receive a wish over the same period of time -- this savings was even after the cost of the wish was factored in.\n\nJohanna Kreafle, M.D. is an emergency medicine physician at the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.", "A corporate strategist from Michigan has given Mayo Clinic its largest gift ever \u2014 $200 million.\n\nThe Rochester-based medical center announced Tuesday that its School of Medicine will be named for the philanthropist, Jay Alix, of Birmingham, Michigan. He also has been named to the Mayo Clinic Board of Trustees.\n\nAlix said his interest in Mayo began in the 1980s when he studied its business model as he was creating what would become AlixPartners, his consulting firm. The Alix Foundation has given Mayo millions of dollars in recent years toward improving its clinical care. The latest record gift is aimed at helping prepare the medical school for the future and make medical education more affordable.\n\n\"This gift will have a long-lasting impact as we boldly transform medical education and research training so the next generation of care providers can improve patient care, accelerate discovery and advance the practice of medicine,\" Mayo's president and chief executive, Dr. John Noseworthy, said in a statement.\n\nAlix said he is concerned about the rising costs of medical education driving away potential doctors.

Rebecca Jarvis is here with the details on that and Rebecca had they surprises not one location but to. Yes this was like the Olympics bidding is prominently they split it may be victims of beauty pageant that ended with two way prisoners like the Olympics bidding process but on steroids so New York City. And Arlington Virginia are the winners of this process if you look at it that way there'll be getting it between the two of them 50000 new jobs. And a five billion dollar investment over the next ten years from Amazon. But as you sad that this was an interesting outcome because a lot of people were thinking that a 238. City and state processed some 238. There jurisdictions were bidding on all of them they're surprised to see that it ended up being too and that it ended up being to basically here in the northeast. Not spread out anywhere else in the country and you know it and went through Scott so much publicity and what made this such a big deal. Well first of all the jobs in and of themselves are big deal 50000 jobs that's a huge deal for what ever local economy gets it but it also became a big deal because of the amount of information. That all of these police say shared so there's an. Arguments being made here that those 238. Places shared information about universities about. What's gonna happen in those communities about spending that will take place planned projects. And on how has all of bad data and we no other company that loves data and uses data. Now may have it and making music to their benefit beyond just this process. All right well now we know and Amazon's strategy was in all of this is presumably. But even on the receiving end like not everybody is super excited about having Amazon com to their own backyard. Explain push back so you have some very high profile individuals that are touting this for example Governor Cuomo. Mayor to block DO here in New York both in the Amazon press release. With very celebratory quotes but not everyone feels that way in the big issue. Are the tax incentives that are giving that are going to be given away to Amazon in order to ward them here so. This whole process everybody who is bidding on this project had to pony up. And New York. And Arlington Virginia are putting billions of dollars in tax incentives on the table in order to lure an Amazon now of course we mention the jobs bill create jobs with those incentives. But there are local. Representatives who think well two million dollars in tax incentives. I would like to see those incentives go somewhere else there's going to be that debate around. How these companies like Amazon because this happens all the time Diana I mean does happen on a grand scale here with Amazon. But it happens all the time that states and cities in jurisdictions. Fight among themselves and give away tax dollars in order to encourage companies to come and work with I'm. But honestly down. Ongoing debate because small businesses don't get says take advantage of those same they don't have that sentenced. Because they don't have the clout at the same time you bring that number of jobs to an area most people see that part as a good thing so. It does seem to be a little bit hit or miss here but either way Amazon coming to the New York area and to Virginia and possibly a few more locations going forward. Absolutely civil have a smaller location. In Nashville where they're going to boo do some really specific types of work in Nashville which they also announced today that's 5000 jobs but. Going forward. Amazon has three headquarters one in Seattle that's the original spot. One in new York and one in Arlington Virginia right look at any doubt that Amazon is taking over the world before today probably don't.

Last year's October deficit was smaller because the government paid $48 billion in benefits in September because Oct. 1 fell on the weekend.\n\nThe government has run a deficit in every October going back to the early 1950s. The new report begins a budget year in which the federal deficit is expected to soar above $1 trillion, reflecting in part the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts Congress approved last December.\n\nIn its latest review this summer, the administration projected that the deficit would climb to $1.09 trillion this year and stay above $1 trillion for three straight years.\n\nThe only time the government has run deficits of this size was for four years from 2009 through 2012. Government revenues at the time were depressed by the worst recession since the 1930s. The US boosted spending to grapple with the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis and provide benefit payments to millions of people who lost their jobs.\n\nThe huge deficits during that period triggered a substantial backlash, which led to government shutdowns as conservative Republicans battled the Obama administration in an effort to cut government spending. This time the outcry has not been as loud.\n\nRepublican lawmakers enthusiastically supported the 10-year $1.5 trillion tax cut approved last year. Democrats charged that most of the benefits went to corporations and wealthy individuals.\n\nWhile the deficits were not a major issue in most mid-term races this year, Trump has said that the new budget he will present to Congress next February will require 5 percent spending cuts for domestic agencies. Larry Kudlow, head of the president's National Economic Council, promised in a CNBC interview Tuesday that the administration would produce a \"tough budget\" for the new year.\n\nThe October report showed that among the biggest increases in spending from a year ago was in interest payments on the public debt, which totaled $32 billion, 30 percent more than a year ago.\n\nTotal outlays in October were $353.2 billion, up 18.3 percent from a year ago, a jump that was heavily influenced by the fact that Social Security and other benefits for October 2017 had been paid in September of last year.\n\nGovernment revenues totaled $252.7 billion, an increase of 7.3 percent from a year ago as a strong economy and low unemployment have offset some of the losses from the tax cuts.", "Transcript for Violence in the Gaza Strip\n\nAnd now let's head overseas to the Gaza Strip violence is flaring up in that area yet again hundreds of rockets have already been fired.

They evaluated, monitored and cared for 97 detainees in 10 secret CIA facilities abroad and accompanied detainees on more than 100 flights.\n\nThe CIA ultimately decided against asking the Justice Department to approve drug-assisted interrogations, sparing CIA doctors \"some significant ethical concerns,\" the report said. It had taken months for the Justice Department to sign off on brutal interrogation tactics, including sleep deprivation, confinement in small spaces and the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding. The CIA's counterterrorism team \"did not want to raise another issue with the Department of Justice,\" the report said.\n\nBefore settling on Versed, the report said researchers studied records of old Soviet drug experiments as well as the CIA's discredited MK-Ultra program from the 1950s and 1960s that involved human experimentation with LSD and other mind-altering drugs on unwitting individuals as part of a long search for some form of truth serum. These experiments were widely criticized and, even today, some experts doubt an effective substance exists.\n\n\"But decades later, the agency was considering experimenting on humans again to test pseudo-scientific theories of learned helplessness on its prisoners,\" Ladin said.\n\nVersed is a brand name for the sedative midazolam, used since the late 1970s and today sold commonly as a generic. It causes drowsiness and relieves anxiety and agitation. It also can temporarily impair memory, and often is used for minor surgery or medical procedures such as colonoscopies that require sedation but not full-blown anesthesia. It's in a class of anti-anxiety medications known as benzodiazepines that work by affecting a brain chemical that calms the activity of nerve cells.\n\n\"Versed was considered possibly worth a trial if unequivocal legal sanction first were obtained,\" the report said. \"There were at least two legal obstacles: a prohibition against medical experimentation on prisoners and a ban on interrogational use of 'mind-altering drugs' or those which 'profoundly altered the senses.'\"\n\nThose questions became moot after the CIA decided against asking the Justice Department to give it a green light. \"At the beginning of 2003, the Office of Medical Services' review, informally termed 'Project Medication' was shelved, never to be reactivated,\" the report said.\n\nThe CIA had no comment on the report's release, but government lawyers emphasized in a court filing in the case early last year that the report, expressly marked \"draft,\" was just one agency officer's impressions of the detention and interrogation program. The document is not the CIA's or the Office of Medical Service's \"final official history, or assessment, of the program,\" the lawyers wrote.\n\nThe ACLU spent more than two years in court trying to get the report released. In September 2017, a federal judge in New York ordered the CIA to release it. Government lawyers tried three more times to keep information contained in the report under wraps, but the ACLU received the bulk of the report in August. The government is still fighting to keep portions secret. They are to file briefs in a federal appeals court in New York on Wednesday, arguing that the judge ordered too much released.\n\nWhile the CIA's harsh interrogation program ended in 2007, the ACLU believes it's important to continue seeking the release of documents about it, especially since President Donald Trump declared during his campaign that he would approve interrogating terror suspects with waterboarding, which is now banned by U.S. law, and a \"hell of a lot worse.\"\n\nCIA Director Gina Haspel, who was involved in supervising a secret CIA detention site in Thailand where detainees were waterboarded, told the Senate during her confirmation hearing that she does \"not support use of enhanced interrogation techniques for any purpose.\"\n\nThe report cites many instances where medical personal expressed concern or protected the health of the detainees. Those who were thrown up against walls \u2014 a practice called \"walling\" \u2014 had their necks protected from whiplash by rolled towels around their necks, the report said. When one detainee, who had been wounded during capture, was confined to a box, care was taken not to force his legs into a position that \"would compromise wound healing.\" Physician assistants overruled using duct tape over the mouths of detainees during flights because air sickness could lead to vomiting and possible aspiration.\n\n\"That doesn't mean that the doctors were sadistic or anything like that,\" Ladin said. \"But it means they were complicit because this pseudo-scientific torture could not have happened without the doctors' participation.\"\n\nAt the same time, the medical office's report said waterboarding was not \"intrinsically painful.\" It said there was \"physical discomfort from the occasional associated retching,\" but that two detainees who endured the most extensive waterboarding sessions complained only \"of the pain of the restraining straps.\"\n\nThat contrasts with the Senate's 2014 report on the CIA's interrogation program, which stated that a prisoner known as Abu Zubaydah, a suspected al-Qaida operative who was waterboarded more than 80 times, \"cried, begged, pleaded, vomited, and required medical resuscitation after being waterboarded.\"\n\nSome CIA medical personnel called waterboarding \"little more than an amateurish experiment\" and others worried that the practice would trigger spasms of the vocal cords, which could, at least temporarily, make it hard to speak or breathe.\n\nAt the same time, other medical personnel contended waterboarding actually \"provided periodic relief\" to a prisoner because it was a break from being forced to stand for long periods of time. The agency medical personnel also said the harsh interrogation program was \"reassuringly free of enduring physical or psychological effects.\"\n\nDr. Sondra Crosby, who has treated victims of torture, including two who were held at CIA secret sites, disagreed.\n\n\"The enduring pain and suffering experienced by the survivors of the CIA program is immense, and includes severe, complex post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, physical ailments, and psychosocial dysfunction,\" said Crosby, of Boston University's School of Medicine and Public Health. \"At least one detainee was tortured to death. Their physical and psychological scars will last a lifetime.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP Medical Writer Lauran Neergaard in Washington contributed to this report.", "Transcript for Trump criticizes France, could replace Homeland Security secretary\n\nMeanwhile president trump approved a disaster declaration in the state.

And I and he's also looking to make this a double shift have a chief of staff John Kelly also leave his position. Kelly has been a very forceful defender of Nielsen in the White House and Nielsen has really been a target of the president's anger and frustration about immigration policies he's blames her for the fact that there was in his viewing increasing border crossings.

And when proper hygiene isn't respected \u2014 like through sharing of needles \u2014 conditions are more propitious for viruses like Ebola to spread.\n\n\"Probably more than 50 percent of cases in Beni have been driven from these tradi-modern health care facilities, and the fact that hygiene and injection practices in these areas are relatively unsafe,\" he said.\n\nSalama said the current Ebola outbreak is \"arguably the most difficult context that we've ever encountered,\" pointing to activities of two armed opposition groups in the region.

Schalit is released five years later following a lopsided prisoner exchange.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nJune 2007\n\nHamas violently ousts Fatah forces from the Gaza Strip and solidifies its control of the territory. Israel and Egypt tighten their blockade of Gaza, which will devastate Gaza's economy over the next decade. Two rival governments emerge, Hamas in Gaza and the Abbas' Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDecember 2008\n\nIn response to heavy rocket fire from Gaza, Israel launches a major three-week offensive. After a 22-day war that kills 1,200 Palestinians and 13 Israelis, the two sides announce a cease-fire.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNovember 2012\n\nIsrael targets and kills Hamas military chief Ahmad Jabari, sparking eight days of militant rocket fire and an Israeli air campaign. Egyptian mediators secure a cease-fire after some 150 Palestinians and six Israelis are killed.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nJuly-August 2014\n\nFollowing the kidnapping and killing of three Israeli teenagers by Hamas members, Israel conducts a sweep against Hamas in the West Bank, prompting rocket attacks from Gaza and Israeli air raids in response. The seven-week conflict that ensues results in more than 2,200 Palestinian deaths in Gaza, more than half of them civilians. In Israel, 67 soldiers and 6 civilians are killed. Israel comes under heavy international criticism for its use of what the United Nations calls disproportionate force.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMarch 2018\n\nPalestinian protesters, led by Hamas, stage massive demonstrations along the perimeter fence against the blockade. Although mostly unarmed, many protesters burn tires, throw rocks and grenades at Israeli troops and damage the perimeter fence. Israeli troops kill more than 170 protesters over a period of several months. Israel says it is defending its border but is accused of using excessive force. Israel and Hamas engage in a number of rounds of intense but brief fighting during this time.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNovember 2018:\n\nViolence flares up after a botched Israeli undercover raid into Gaza that killed seven Palestinian militants and a senior Israeli army officer, marking the most serious escalation since the war in 2014. Gaza militants fire hundreds of rockets at Israel in response, killing a Palestinian laborer in southern Israel. At least seven Palestinians, among them five militants, are killed in Gaza.", "When the sky turned pitch black and the electricity went out, Melissa Schuster got into her car with her 89-year-old mother, her husband who was recovering from surgery, and her two cats and fled their home in Paradise, California, thinking they would eventually return.\n\n\"People think of fires as moving along the ground and catching this tree and that tree, and then that house or whatever,\" Schuster, a Paradise town council member, said in an interview on ABC News' \"Start Here\" podcast. \"That isn't what happened here. This was a firestorm. So the wind was picking up large pieces of debris and starting fires all over town wherever it happened to land.\"\n\nSchuster had evacuated her home during the Humboldt fire that swept through Butte County in 2008, destroying 87 homes and burning 23,344 acres. But after three days, most residents of Paradise were back in their houses.\n\nJohn Locher/AP\n\nThis time it was different. The firestorm that struck the Sierra foothills community on Thursday destroyed nearly the entire town, including Schuster\u2019s home. She said it gave Paradise the dubious distinction of being the only place in America where the entire town council is currently homeless.\n\n\"Our entire five-member council is homeless,\" Schuster said. \"All of our houses have been destroyed.\"\n\nShe described a harrowing escape on the two-lane road leading out of the burning town, which quickly became clogged with cars.\n\nWhile stuck in the traffic jam, Schuster said she \"put on my council hat\" and began trying to direct vehicles.\n\n\"I tried to get them to do contraflow, with both lanes going out of town,\" she said.\n\nThen she got a call from her son, saying his wife and children were stuck in another traffic jam and that their car was on fire.\n\nJustin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\n\"Of course, for my husband and I, the thought of losing our daughter-in-law and grandchildren hit us very very hard,\" she said.\n\nShe said that after six agonizing hours, they received word that their daughter-in-law and grandchildren had made it out of harm's way.\n\nSchuster said that while she and most residents of Paradise are looking at a long recovery, the immediate danger is far from over.\n\n\"The entire community of Paradise is a toxic wasteland right now,\" she said, holding back tears. \"In addition to that, and this is the hardest part for me to even talk about, the number of fatalities is [among] things that we don't know at this moment and that's something that has to be determined before people can move back in.\"\n\nNoah Berger/AP\n\nOn Monday night, Butte County Sheriff's Officials announced that 13 additional bodies were discovered in the Camp Fire zone, including 10 in Paradise, bringing the total number of people killed by the blaze to 42 and making it the deadliest wildland inferno in the state's history.\n\n\"We have crews, we have teams -- you know, coroner teams -- that have to go house to house and vehicle to vehicle,\" Schuster said. \"There are 6,400 homes that were burnt. That's a lot of homes they have to go through to ensure that there are no human remains there, not to mention the hundreds of vehicles that are burned out and just strewn all over the roads. And beyond that, it's just dangerous. It's toxic and it's dangerous.\"\n\nNoah Berger/AP\n\nAsked if Paradise will be rebuilt, Schuster emphatically said, \"Yes! Yes, yes, yes!\"\n\n\"We are in this horrible, horrible tragedy. We will come out of this horrible tragedy ... together,\" Schuster said. \"We will rebuild our homes, we will rebuild our town stronger, better, safer and more beautiful than ever. We will do that. Paradise: together, strong.\"", "Californians who lost a home to the state's wildfires could face a nightmarish recovery as they try to rebuild.\n\nIt's always a challenge to recuperate after any disaster, but California residents face a unique problem. Experts say the seemingly endless series of devastating wildfires in recent years has increased costs and limited the available pool of workers needed to rebuild.\n\nHomeowners can also find themselves confused by the insurance system and even underinsured, leaving them to bear more of the costs of rebuilding than they might have expected.\n\nBlazes have been so frequent that the state government recently passed a spate of laws intended to help victims of wildfires, but experts say it can still sometimes take years for a home to be rebuilt.\n\nCalifornia is currently fighting three fires \u2014 the Camp Fire in the northern part of the state and the Woolsey and Hill fires just outside of Los Angeles in the south. Statewide, thousands of people have been evacuated, more than 225,000 acres have burned and 44 people have died.\n\nThe Camp Fire is now deemed the most deadly in the state's history \u2014 killing at least 42 people and burning more than 125,000 acres. That follows this summer's Mendocino Complex fire, which burned more than 459,000 acres and led to more than $56 million in insured losses, and a particularly brutal fire season in 2017.\n\nCredit rating agency Moody's on Monday estimated that insured losses for the three current fires will be between $3 billion and $6 billion. The staggering price tag is due in part to the size of the fires but also the costs of rebuilding \u2014 both materials and labor.\n\nDan Dunmoyer, president and CEO of the California Building Industry Association, said builders were having trouble finding enough workers prior to the fires because of high demand for housing in the state. The spate of fires has only worsened the problem and that adds to the delay for consumers.\n\n\"If your home burns down by itself, you have no problem rebuilding, but if it burns down with 2,000 others, you have to wait,\" Dunmoyer said.\n\nHomeowners also sometimes find themselves struggling to navigate the insurance system.\n\nUnited Policyholders, a nonprofit that aims to help consumers with insurance issues, said that it regularly hears from policyholders struggling with their insurer following a disaster. Policies may not have been updated in some time or estimates of rebuilding costs were too low, so homeowners find themselves on the hook for large expenses. The group estimates, based on polls of communities affected by disasters, that roughly two-thirds of insured households are underinsured. Or, they simply are struggling to jump through the hoops.\n\n\"The insurance piece really gets people because they felt like it was the rug getting pulled out from under them,\" said Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders. \"OK, I lost everything, but at least I have insurance. But then insurance is a fight.\"\n\nWhile it can be a smooth process for some, others feel like \"mother nature just took my house, now insurance took my sanity,\" she said.\n\nThe process became so problematic that a series of laws were passed to help protect homeowners.\n\nUnder the new rules, homeowners have three years to rebuild and a six-month extension if the delays are out of their control. Insurance companies must also now provide an updated cost for rebuilding every time a policyholder renews, to help prevent the sticker shock some victims suffered. Other changes allow more time to sue their insurer following a declared disaster, given that it now takes longer to rebuild.\n\nAll the same, Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones has expressed disappointment the state couldn't do more. Californians are still able to find property and casualty insurance, although Jones has previously warned that the increasing number and severity of wildfires will limit availability and increase costs in the future.", "More children have been diagnosed with a mysterious paralyzing illness in recent weeks, and U.S. health officials said Tuesday that they still aren't sure what's causing it.\n\nThis year's count could surpass the tallies seen in similar outbreaks in 2014 and 2016, officials said. Fortunately, the disease remains rare: This year, there have been 90 cases spread among 27 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\n\nIt's not clear what's causing some children to lose the ability to move their face, neck, back, arms or legs. The symptoms tend to occur about a week after the children had a fever and respiratory illness.\n\nHealth officials call the condition acute flaccid myelitis. No one has died from it this year, but CDC officials say at least half the patients do not recover from the paralysis and some have serious complications.\n\nPolio and West Nile virus have been ruled out. Doctors have suspected the cause might be some kind of enterovirus, which in most people causes cold symptoms. But CDC officials say that's not clear.\n\nThe first mysterious wave of paralysis cases in 2014 coincided with a wider spike in illnesses connected to an enterovirus called EV-D68, CDC officials said. But there was no such spike during the waves in 2016 or this year.\n\nThere's also a lack of clinical evidence: CDC officials have checked the spinal fluid of about three-quarters of the 90 patients, and found EV-68 in only one. Another type of enterovirus called EV-A71 was found in only one other patient.\n\nBut there are questions about that, too. If a virus is the cause, it's possible the test is not good enough, or the germ left the spinal fluid by the time the tests were taken, said the CDC's Dr. Nancy Messonnier. It's also possible the culprit is hiding elsewhere in the body.\n\nOr perhaps the paralyzing illnesses are caused by some new germ for which no lab test has been developed. Or maybe there's some predisposing factor in some patients that cause their immune systems to react so severely to a germ or other trigger that the immune response causes paralysis, CDC officials said.\n\nParents and even some scientists have criticized the agency for not solving the riddle.\n\n\"I understand why parents are frustrated. I'm frustrated. I want answers too,\" said Messonnier, who is overseeing the agency's outbreak investigation. CDC officials have pledged to do more to notify doctors to look for possible cases and to more thoroughly review cases from years past for further clues.\n\nAbout 120 cases were confirmed in 2014, the first time such a wave occurred. Another 149 were reported in 2016. In 2015 and 2017, the counts were far lower, and it's not clear why.\n\nThe illnesses have spiked in September each year there's been a wave and tailed off significantly by November. But it can take weeks to determine which cases should be counted in the outbreak. More than 160 cases are still being investigated, and some of those may join the count, CDC officials said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Add Brexit as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Brexit news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nAfter months of stalled talks, false starts and setbacks, negotiators from Britain and the European Union struck a proposed divorce deal Tuesday to provide for the U.K.'s smooth exit from the bloc.\n\nBut the agreement faces major political hurdles starting Wednesday, when British Prime Minister Theresa May will try to win the approval of her divided Cabinet for a deal many ministers view with skepticism.\n\nThe British government confirmed that the negotiating teams had reached a draft agreement and the Cabinet would hold a special meeting Wednesday afternoon to consider the proposal. Its support isn't guaranteed: May is under pressure from pro-Brexit ministers not to make further concessions to the EU on the key issue of the Irish border.\n\nA spokesman for chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier urged caution, saying a deal wasn't yet finalized and the bloc would \"take stock\" Wednesday.\n\nAmbassadors from the 27 other EU countries are also due to hold a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday.\n\nBritain wants to seal a deal this fall, so that Parliament has time to vote on it before the U.K. leaves the bloc on March 29. The European Parliament also has to approve any agreement, as do all 28 EU nations.\n\nOfficials have said for weeks that agreement on divorce terms and a framework for future U.K.-EU relations was 95 percent complete, and for several days negotiators have been meeting late into the night in Brussels in a bid to close the remaining gaps.\n\nThe main obstacle has long been how to ensure there are no customs posts or other checks along the border between the U.K.'s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland after Brexit. Britain and the EU agree that there must be no barriers that could disrupt businesses and residents on either side of the border and undermine Northern Ireland's hard-won peace process \u2014 but they have differed on how to achieve that.\n\nIrish national broadcaster RTE said the draft agreement involves a common customs arrangement for the U.K. and the EU, to eliminate the need for border checks, with special provisions for Northern Ireland and a review mechanism to oversee its functioning.\n\nA sticking point in talks has been Britain's insistence that any such customs arrangement must be temporary. The EU says that in order to guarantee an open border, it can't have a time limit.\n\nThe pound rallied on news of a deal, rising 1.5 percent against the dollar to $1.3038.\n\nBut May faces pressure from pro-Brexit Cabinet members and lawmakers not to agree to an arrangement that binds Britain to EU trade rules indefinitely.\n\nFormer Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a staunch \"Brexiteer,\" said the deal was unacceptable and Cabinet ministers should \"chuck it out.\"\n\nMay also faces growing opposition from pro-EU lawmakers, who say her proposed Brexit deal is worse than the status quo and the British public should get a new vote on whether to leave or to stay.\n\nOpposition from both sides of the Brexit divide means May could struggle to get a deal approved by Parliament.\n\nMay's Conservative Party doesn't hold a majority of seats in the House of Commons, and relies on 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to win votes. The DUP is wary of any border compromise that could bind Northern Ireland to the EU.\n\nDUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the party wouldn't accept \"that our laws would be made in Brussels, not in Westminster or Belfast. That is the fundamental red line.\"\n\nIf there is no final agreement soon, U.K. businesses will have to start implementing contingency plans for a \"no-deal\" Brexit \u2014 steps that could include cutting jobs, stockpiling goods and relocating production and services outside Britain.\n\nEven with such measures in place, the British government says leaving the EU without a deal could cause major economic disruption, with gridlock at ports and disruption to supplies of foods, goods and medicines.\n\nOn Tuesday, the European Commission published a sheaf of notices outlining changes in a host of areas in the event of a no-deal Brexit. They point to major disruption for people and businesses: U.K. truckers' licenses won't be valid in the EU, British airlines will no longer enjoy traffic rights, and even British mineral water will cease to be recognized as such by the EU.\n\nThe EU said Tuesday it was proposing visa-free travel for U.K. citizens on short trips, even if there is no deal \u2014 but only if Britain reciprocates.\n\nFor now, whether or not there is a deal relies on volatile British politics, and the outcome is hard to predict.\n\n\"This side of the Channel we are very happy with a balanced solution to the Northern Irish dilemma,\" said Tom Vandenkendelaere, a Christian Democrat member of the European Parliament. \"The other side of the Channel?

The secretary of state declined a separate request to stop the election process without a court order.\n\nThe first round of voting on Election Day ended with Poliquin and Democrat Jared Golden both collecting 46 percent of the vote in Maine's huge, largely rural 2nd Congressional District, with Poliquin maintaining a slim edge of about 2,000 votes in unofficial returns.\n\n\"I won the election fair and square,\" Poliquin said Tuesday, declaring the lawsuit is necessary to test the constitutionality of the voting system.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Poliquin, who is seeking a third term, and three Republican activists contend he should be declared the winner because he has the most first-place votes. But the ranked-choice system requires additional voting rounds because neither he nor Golden won an outright majority.\n\nThe lawsuit says the \"foundation of our 'democratic process' is the right of all qualified voters to cast their votes effectively.\" It suggests that the ranked voting system \"denies Plaintiffs the opportunity to cast their votes effectively.\"\n\nThe lawsuit makes several arguments, including that the voting system violates the \"one-person, one-vote\" principle, violating the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nPoliquin's Democratic challenger decried the 11th-hour attempt to derail the process following the most expensive congressional race in Maine history.\n\n\"Any attempt by Bruce Poliquin to change the rules after votes have already been cast is an affront to the law and to the people of Maine,\" Jon Breed, Golden's campaign manager, said in a statement Tuesday. If Poliquin were really concerned, Breed said, he should have sued before the election.\n\nPoliquin's lead attorney, former Federal Election Commission Chairman Lee Goodman, brushed aside concerns about the timing of the lawsuit. He said it wasn't filed sooner because it was unclear whether additional tabulations were going to be necessary to determine a winner.\n\nDemocratic Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap said that his office would continue to process ballots and that it would review with legal advisers any court order to stop. Election workers had more than 100 towns to go by midday Tuesday, he said.\n\nSupporters argue the system already has cleared legal challenges. Several courts, including the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, have upheld the constitutionality of ranked-choice voting, supporters said.\n\n\"We're seeing these kinds of post-election sore loser lawsuits across the country,\" said Rob Richie, of FairVote, an electoral reform group that pressed for Maine's adoption of the system.\n\nPoliquin, however, insisted the lawsuit is not just about sour grapes over the possibility Golden could walk away as the winner. He said it's his \"duty\" to test the system at the federal level.\n\n\"Not addressing this important constitutional matter would be completely irresponsible and not doing my job,\" he said.\n\nThe ranked-choice voting system approved by referendum in 2016 lets voters rank candidates from first to last on the ballot. It provides for eliminations of last-place candidates and reallocations of votes to ensure that the winner gets a majority.\n\nThe system is touted as a way to let people caste votes for third-party or independent candidates without concern for political \"spoilers\" or vote-splitting. Critics, including Poliquin, say it's confusing.\n\nLast-place candidates are eliminated one by one if no one receives a majority of the vote. Then the losers' second-choice votes are counted. The process can be repeated as many times as is necessary until there's a majority winner.\n\nIn this case, two independents in the four-way race who together collected about 8 percent of the vote will be eliminated, and it's possible the reallocation of votes could end up favoring Golden even though he did not collect the most first-round votes.\n\nFor now, the system is used only in federal races and in statewide primary elections in Maine. It cannot be used in the governor's race or legislative races because of concerns it runs afoul of the Maine Constitution.\n\nDemocratic Gov.-elect Janet Mills has vowed to seek to amend the constitution so the system can be used in all elections.\n\nThere was no controversy in Maine's other House race and Senate race. Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree and independent Sen. Angus King each won with a majority of the vote, making further tabulations unnecessary.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSharp reported from Portland, Maine. Associated Press writer Patrick Whittle in Portland contributed to this report.", "The Norwegian Defense Ministry said Tuesday that Russian forces in the Arctic disturbed GPS location signals during a recent large NATO drill in Norway.\n\nThe ministry said that Norway's Foreign Ministry earlier had raised the issue with Russian authorities.\n\nIn an email Tuesday to The Associated Press, the ministry said it \"was aware that that jamming has been recorded between Oct. 16 and Nov. 7 from the Russian forces\" on the Arctic Kola peninsula.\n\nNATO's huge exercise Trident Juncture that included soldiers from 31 countries, was staged in Norway from Oct. 25 to Nov. 7. Finland and Sweden, which are not NATO members, also took part in the drill.\n\nThe jamming of the location signals is not believed to have caused any accidents.\n\nOver the weekend, Finnish Prime Minister Juha Sipila said his country's GPS location signals were intentionally disrupted in the northern Lapland region.\n\nFinland's state Air Navigation Services issued a warning to civilian air traffic earlier last week.\n\nWithout providing any further evidence, Sipila said Sunday that neighboring Russia may have been to blame.\n\n\"It's possible Russia was the disrupting party,\" Sipila said in an interview with Finnish public broadcaster YLE.\n\nFinnish President Sauli Niinisto has called for a thorough investigation into the incident.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry could not be reached Tuesday for comment on Norway's claim. The Kremlin on Monday denied involvement in the Finnish GPS disturbance.\n\n\"We know nothing about Russia's possible involvement in those GPS failures,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said according to TASS news agency. \"There is a trend to blame all mortal sins on Russia.\"\n\nRussia is known to have substantial capabilities for electronic warfare. Experts say it has in recent years invested heavily in technology that can affect GPS location signals over a broad area.\n\nThe northern Arctic regions of Finland's Lapland and Norway's Finnmark are adjacent to Russia's Kola Peninsula, which is home to Russia's Northern Fleet with major naval and submarine bases and other Russian military installations.\n\nAsked about Finland's claims, NATO's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters Monday that cyber and electronic warfare are becoming more and more widespread, \"therefore we take all these issues very seriously.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOlsen reported from Copenhagen, Denmark.", "When you think of the wives and girlfriends of criminals and mobsters in cinema and television, what or who comes to mind? Kay Adams? Elvira Hancock? Skyler White? They are either victims of a man's misdeeds or end up becoming part of the problem. They might get fancy jewelry or a big house, but they are the ones who get shut out of the room. They get greedy. They get addicted. They get killed. And, as an unwritten rule, they are secondary.\n\nIt's part of the reason why Steve McQueen's \" Widows \" is such a welcome cocktail: The wives are the ones in the spotlight. Their husbands, the criminals fetishized by so, so many movies, are the ones who die at the beginning.\n\nIn his first film since the Oscar-winning \"12 Years a Slave,\" McQueen has gone in a very different direction with this Lynda La Plante adaptation. Widows\" is a B-movie thriller with an all-star ensemble and a dusting of art house cred. McQueen co-wrote it with \"Gone Girl\" author Gillian Flynn and it is dark, relentlessly intense and crafted for mass audience appeal. And who better to stare down the camera, and every seedy character the city of Chicago has to offer, from corrupt legacy politicians (Colin Farrell and Robert Duvall) to truly terrifying gang muscle (\"Get Out's\" Daniel Kaluuya), than the incomparable Viola Davis?\n\nDavis plays Veronica Rawlins, a well-heeled teacher's union representative who is married to a very powerful and very bad man, Harry Rawlins (Liam Neeson). Harry has done well in a corrupt Chicago \u2014 the passionate couple share a sleek high-rise Lake Shore Drive apartment, a driver and all the niceties that sort of real estate implies. But when he and his crew (including Jon Bernthal and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) get gunned down during a robbery gone wrong, Veronica is the one the aggrieved come after to collect.\n\nUnfortunately for her, the crew her late husband was stealing $2 million from are also a powerful, murderous and, now, angry, rival set of criminals. They're led by Jamal Manning (Brian Tyree Henry) and his brother Jatemme (Kaluuya), and have until this point managed to keep the peace with Rawlins' crew. Jamal is running for alderman of his South Side neighborhood that is a stronghold of a Chicago political dynasty, the Mulligans (Duvall and Farrell) that maintains property there only as a front \u2014 and the Mannings need the money to take them down. One on-the-nose, but startlingly effective, sequence, shows Jack Mulligan's drive home from the projects to his own gilded, heavily armed part of the neighborhood. This is just context for what's going on with Veronica and it will all come together eventually, with some good twists and turns in the mix.\n\nJamal threatens Veronica to collect what was stolen and she decides to step into Harry's shoes and enlist the widows of his crew to help. There's Linda (Michelle Rodriguez), a mother of two whose Quinceanera shop has been repossessed because of her late husband's gambling habits, and Alice (Elizabeth Debicki), a woman who has been mistreated by everyone in her life, from her husband to her mother, who suggests she become a high-end sex worker. All are basically riffs on the typical film \"victim wife,\" only here they get to take charge and plan and execute the elaborate heist. Veronica is a tough boss and pushes Alice and Linda, and eventually Belle (Cynthia Erivo), to realize their own power as they amusingly use their skills, whether plain street savvy or just taking advantage of the fact that they are underestimated and overlooked simply by being women (a point that is much better made here than in \"Ocean's 8\").\n\nThe ensemble is a blast. Everyone gets their moment and you come away feeling like you really got to know most of them, but it is Davis and her unforgettably searing intensity (and killer wardrobe) who owns \"Widows\" from start to finish.\n\nMcQueen builds tension masterfully throughout, although is so sprawling that at times you're left wondering whether this might have been better told as a limited television series. Then again, is it worth complaining about relative brevity when done this well?\n\n\"Widows,\" a 20th Century Fox release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for \"violence, language throughout, and some sexual content/nudity.\" Running time: 129 minutes.

It allows doctors to prescribe medication to their patients\u2019 partners without examining them. The idea is to prevent the kind of reinfections described by Bowe \u2014 and stop the transmission of STDs to others.\n\nHowever, many physicians aren\u2019t taking the federal government\u2019s advice because of entrenched ethical and legal concerns.\n\n\u201cHealth care providers have a long tradition of being hesitant to prescribe to people they haven\u2019t seen,\u201d said Edward Hook, professor at the University of Alabama\u2019s medical school in Birmingham. \u201cThere is a certain skepticism.\u201d\n\nA nationwide surge of sexually transmitted diseases in recent years, however, has created a sense of urgency for doctors to embrace the practice. STD rates have hit an all-time high, according to the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention. In 2017, the rate of reported gonorrhea cases increased nearly 19 percent from a year earlier to 555,608. The rate of chlamydia cases rose almost 7 percent to 1.7 million.\n\n\u201cSTDs are everywhere,\u201d said Dr. Cornelius Jamison, a lecturer at the University of Michigan Medical School. \u201cWe have to figure out how to \u2026 prevent the spread of these infections. And it\u2019s necessary to be able to treat multiple people at once.\u201d\n\nA majority of states allow expedited partner therapy. Two states \u2014 South Carolina and Kentucky \u2014 prohibit it, and six others plus Puerto Rico lack clear guidance for physicians.\n\nA 2014 study showed that patients were as much as 29 percent less likely to be re-infected when their physicians prescribed medication to their partners. The study also showed that partners who got those prescriptions were more likely to take the drugs than ones who were simply referred to a doctor.\n\nYet only about half of providers reported ever having prescribed drugs to the partners of patients with chlamydia, and only 10 percent said they always did so, according to a different study. Chlamydia rates were higher in states with no law explicitly allowing partner prescriptions, research published earlier this year showed.\n\nBecause of increasing antibiotic resistance to gonorrhea, the CDC no longer recommends oral antibiotics alone for the infection. But if patients\u2019 partners can\u2019t go in for the recommended treatment, which includes an injection, the CDC said that oral antibiotics by themselves are better than no treatment at all.\n\n\u201cIncreasing resistance plus increasing disease rates is a recipe for disaster,\u201d said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors. The partner treatment is important for \u201ccombating the rising rates of gonorrhea in the U.S. before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nThe CDC recommendations are primarily for heterosexual partners because there is less data on the effectiveness of partner treatment in men who sleep with men, and because of concern about HIV risk.\n\nBowe said that even though she writes STD prescriptions for her patients\u2019 partners, she still worries about possible drug allergies or side effects.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know their medical conditions,\u201d she said. \u201cI may contribute to a problem down the road that I\u2019m going to be held liable for.\u201d\n\nIn many cases, doctors and patients simply do not know about partner therapy. Ulysses Rico, who lives in Coachella, Calif., said he contracted gonorrhea several years ago and was treated by his doctor. He didn\u2019t know at the time that he could have requested medicine for his girlfriend. She was reluctant to go to her doctor and instead got the required antibiotics through a friend who worked at a hospital.\n\n\u201cIt would have been so much easier to handle the situation for both of us at the [same] moment,\u201d Rico said.\n\nSeveral medical associations support partner treatment. But they acknowledge the ethical issues, saying it should be used only if the partners are unable or unwilling to come in for care.\n\nFederal officials are trying to raise awareness of the practice by training doctors and other medical professionals, said Laura Bachmann, chief medical officer of the CDC\u2019s office of STD prevention. The agency posts a map with details about the practice in each state.\n\nOver the past several years, advocates have won battles state-by-state to get partner treatment approved, but implementation is challenging and varies widely, said Harvey, whose National Coalition of STD Directors is a member organization that works to eliminate sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nThe fact that some states don\u2019t allow it, or haven\u2019t set clear guidelines for physicians, also creates confusion \u2014 and disparities across state lines.\n\nThe Planned Parenthood affiliate that serves Indiana and Kentucky sees this firsthand, said clinical services director Emilie Theis. In Indiana, providers can legally write prescriptions for their patients\u2019 partners, but they are prohibited from doing so in Kentucky, even though the clinics are only a short drive apart, she noted. A similar dynamic is at play along the South Carolina-North Carolina border, where Bowe practices.\n\nCalifornia started allowing partner treatment for chlamydia in 2001 and for gonorrhea in 2007. The state gives medication to certain safety-net clinics, a program it expanded three years ago. However, \u201cit has been an incredibly difficult sell\u201d because many medical providers think \u201cit\u2019s a little bit outside of the traditional practice of medicine,\u201d said Heidi Bauer, chief of the STD control branch of California\u2019s public health department.\n\nAt APLA Health, which runs several health clinics in the Los Angeles area, nurse practitioner Karla Taborga occasionally gives antibiotics to patients for their partners. But she tries to get the partners into the clinic first, because she worries they might also be at risk for other sexually transmitted infections.\n\n\u201cIf we are just treating for chlamydia, we could be missing gonorrhea, syphilis or, God forbid, HIV,\u201d Taborga said. But if prescribing the drugs without seeing the patients is the only way to treat them, she said, \u201cit\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d\n\nEdith Torres, a Los Angeles resident, said she pressured her then-husband to go to the doctor after he gave her chlamydia several years ago: She refused to have sex with him until he did. Torres said she wanted him to hear directly from the doctor about the risks of STDs and how they are transmitted.\n\nIf he had taken the medication without a doctor visit, he wouldn\u2019t have learned those things, she said. \u201cI was scared, and I didn\u2019t want to get it again.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Only three coalition airstrikes were carried out in the last 24 hours, targeting rebel positions outside the city.\n\nThe truce followed advances by the coalition in their latest attempt to retake the city from the Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, with its forces now 5 kilometers (3 miles) short of the port, Yemen's traditional lifeline.\n\nThe officials said efforts were being made to persuade the Houthis to abandon the city and hand over control to an independent Yemeni party that would run the port under U.N. supervision. The Houthis, who had in the past rejected the proposal, said the coalition accepted the truce because of its heavy casualties and because it came under international pressure to spare some 500,000 civilians inside the city the death and destruction that come with street-to-street fighting, which already began this week.\n\nThe military and Houthi officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.\n\nThe U.N. envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, welcomed the reduction of hostilities and said it was a \"crucial step\" to prevent further humanitarian suffering.\n\n\"I call upon all parties to the conflict to show continued restraint.

The level of corruption in a country like Nigeria is well known, he said.\n\nThe type of traffic misdirection involved can knock essential services offline and facilitate espionage and financial theft. It can also be used to block access to information by sending data requests into internet black holes. Experts say China, in particular, has systematically hijacked and diverted U.S. internet traffic.\n\nBut the problem can also result from human error. It's very difficult to tell the difference, said Williams.\n\nGoogle said it had no reason to believe the traffic hijacking was malicious.\n\nAshiru said engineers at MainOne, a major west African ISP, mistakenly forwarded to China Telecom addresses for Google services that were supposed to be local. The Chinese company, in turn, sent along the bad data to Russia's TransTelecom, a major internet presence. Ashiru said MainOne did not yet understand why China Telecom did that, as the state-run company normally doesn't allow Google traffic on its network.\n\nThe traffic diversion into China created a detour with a dead end, preventing users from accessing the affected Google services, said Alex Henthorn-Iwane, an executive at the network-intelligence company ThousandEyes.\n\nHe said Monday's incident offered yet another lesson in the internet's susceptibility to \"unpredictable and destabilizing events. If this could happen to a company with the scale and resources available that Google has, realize it could happen to anyone.\"\n\nThe diversion, known as border gateway protocol route hijacking, is built into the internet , which was designed for collaboration by trusted parties \u2014 not competition by hostile nation-states. Experts say it is fixable but that would require investments in encrypted routers that the industry has resisted .\n\nThousandEyes said the diversion at minimum made Google's search and business collaboration tools difficult or impossible to reach and \"put valuable Google traffic in the hands of ISPs in countries with a long history of Internet surveillance.\"\n\nMost network traffic to Google services \u2014 94 percent as of Oct. 27 \u2014 is encrypted, which shields it from prying eyes even if diverted. But work was interrupted on services like G-Suite, which Google CEO Sundar Pichai in February said had more than 4 million businesses as customers. G-Suite and Google Cloud combined generate about $4 billion in revenue each year.\n\nGoogle did not quantify the disruption other than to say in a statement that \"access to some Google services was impacted.\"\n\nIndeed, the phenomenon has occurred before. Google was briefly afflicted in 2015 when an Indian provider stumbled. In perhaps the best-known case, Pakistan Telecom inadvertently hijacked YouTube's global traffic in 2008 for a few hours when it was trying to enforce a domestic ban. It sent all YouTube traffic into a virtual ditch in Pakistan.\n\nIn two recent cases, such rerouting has affected financial sites. In April 2017, one affected MasterCard and Visa among other sites. This past April, another hijacking enabled cryptocurrency theft .\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP Technology Writer Michael Liedtke contributed from San Francisco.", "Gov. Bill Haslam said Tuesday that an Amazon operations hub expected to create 5,000 jobs in Tennessee will be \"the single largest jobs commitment made by a company in Tennessee's history.\"\n\nAmazon will invest $230 million-plus to locate its Operations Center of Excellence in Nashville Yards, a 15-acre (6-hectare), mixed-use downtown development still under construction in the booming southern city. Holly Sullivan of Amazon Public Policy says Nashville will become the eastern U.S. hub for its retail operations division, with hiring to begin next year.\n\nAmazon announced the Nashville site the same day it revealed it would split its much-anticipated second headquarters between New York and Arlington, Virginia, each getting 25,000 jobs.\n\n\"This is a game changer for Tennessee. The ripple effect of Amazon's decision to invest $230 million in our state and create 5,000 high-paying jobs in downtown Nashville will be felt for years to come,\" Haslam said in a statement.\n\nAmazon's new 1 million square-foot Nashville office space will host tech and management functions, including customer fulfillment, customer service, transportation and supply chain. The project is expected to add an estimated incremental tax revenue of more than $1 billion over the next 10 years, according to the company.\n\nAmazon says it will receive up to $102 million in performance-based incentives based on the creation of 5,000 jobs with an average wage exceeding $150,000 in Nashville.\n\n\"We think it's just a great location for our employees, but also a great location to really further the resilience and the vibrancy, and just the overall coolness of Nashville, Tennessee,\" Sullivan said Tuesday at a news conference with Gov. Haslam.\n\nThe company received 238 proposals for its new headquarters before narrowing it down to 20 in January, a shortlist that included Nashville.\n\nHaslam said that in the past 30 days or so, the conversation shifted toward the possibility of the smaller hub in Nashville. For perspective, Haslam said the Amazon headquarters proposal could have resulted in 50,000 new jobs in one location, and Nashville currently only has 70,000 jobs downtown.\n\n\"I think we realized, Nashville realized and Amazon realized, to do something that big, as much as Nashville has grown, would still be a challenge to infrastructure and to the talent demand,\" Haslam said at the news conference.\n\nAmazon's choice also followed the resounding defeat of a multibillion-dollar Nashville transit ballot measure in the May election, a plan that banked on tax increases to introduce a light rail system, expand bus routes and build a downtown underground tunnel. In fielding proposals for the second headquarters, Amazon stressed the importance of direct access to mass transit.\n\nNashville Mayor David Briley said the city still continues to invest in expanding its existing transit system.\n\nAmazon's incentives package includes a cash grant for capital expenditures from the state of $65 million based on the company creating 5,000 jobs over the next seven years \u2014 equivalent to $13,000 per job.\n\nMeanwhile, Nashville has agreed to give up to a $15 million cash grant based on each job created within the same timeframe. The annual payment from the city, however, will be dependent on the actual number of employees added.\n\nFinally, Amazon will receive a job tax credit to offset 50 percent of Tennessee's franchise and excise taxes based on $4,500 per job over the next seven years \u2014 worth about $21.7 million.\n\nA free market think-tank, Beacon Center of Tennessee, became a quick critic of the deal. Beacon Center spokesman Mark Cunningham said officials \"got scammed into giving the company more than $100 million in taxpayer giveaways for a consolation prize.\"\n\nBut Briley and Haslam contended that Nashville and the state are getting great deals that will quickly pay themselves off. Haslam said he expects 1.6 more jobs in the state for every direct job created, for a total of 13,000-plus.\n\nThe state says Amazon currently has six Tennessee facilities employing more than 6,500 people.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Kimberlee Kruesi in Nashville contributed to this report.", "Amazon could get more than $2 billion in tax breaks and other incentives as part of its deals to open up two new offices with more than 25,000 new jobs at each location.

Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nCNN took its access battle against the Trump administration to court on Tuesday, demanding the reinstatement of correspondent Jim Acosta's White House credentials because their revocation violates the right of freedom of the press.\n\nBesides seeking an injunction to let Acosta return immediately, CNN is launching a case that will test the ability of government officials anywhere to freeze out a reporter who displeases them.\n\nThe White House, never shy about picking a fight with CNN, says bring it on.\n\n\"This is just more grandstanding from CNN, and we will vigorously defend against this lawsuit,\" said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.\n\nThe administration stripped Acosta of his pass following President Donald Trump's contentious news conference last week, during which Acosta refused to give up a microphone when the president said he didn't want to hear anything more from him.\n\nSanders initially explained the decision by accusing Acosta of making improper physical contact with the intern seeking to grab the microphone. But that rationale disappeared after witnesses backed Acosta's account that he was just trying to keep the mic, and Sanders distributed a doctored video that made it appear Acosta was more aggressive than he actually was.\n\nTrump called Acosta a \"rude, terrible person,\" and Sanders on Tuesday accused Acosta of being unprofessional by trying to dominate the questioning at the news conference.\n\nFor its part, CNN believes the White House is trying to silence a reporter.\n\nTrump has made CNN and its reporters a particular target of his denunciation of \"fake news\" and characterization of the media as an enemy of the people. CNN CEO Jeff Zucker, in a letter to White House chief of staff John Kelly, called Trump's attitude toward CNN a \"pattern of targeted harassment.\"\n\n\"Mr. Acosta's press credentials must be restored so that all members of the press know they will remain free to ask tough questions, challenge government officials and report the business of the nation to the American people,\" said Theodore Olson, former U.S. solicitor general and one of CNN's lawyers on the case.\n\nThe White House Correspondents' Association backed the lawsuit, filed in Washington, D.C., district court.\n\n\"The president of the United States should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him,\" said Olivier Knox, president of the correspondents' group.\n\nCNN would seem to be on strong legal ground, said Katie Fallow, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute. During the Nixon administration in the 1970s, the Secret Service tried to deny credentials to a reporter from the Nation magazine because he had been involved in physical altercations, but was overruled by the D.C. circuit court, she said.\n\n\"I think it's important, particularly as the president continues to push back on the role of an independent press, to stake out the legal rules that should govern this and not let the president block people from speaking based on their viewpoint,\" Fallow said.\n\nCNN said Acosta was given no warning of the action, and no recourse to appeal it. Acosta traveled to Paris to cover Trump's visit there this weekend and, although given permission by the French government to cover a news event, the Secret Service denied him entrance, the company said.\n\nBecause of this, CNN also has a strong argument to overturn the White House stance based on due process grounds, said Jeff Robbins, a lawyer who focuses on media issues for the firm of Saul, Ewing, Arstein & Lehr in Boston.\n\n\"Pick your poison \u2014 it's the Fifth Amendment or the First Amendment,\" Robbins said.\n\nLegalities aside, the president has never been afraid to fight the media, believing the stance resonates with his supporters.\n\nAnd Acosta is one of the reporters they dislike the most. Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, who worked for President George W. Bush, last week dismissed the supposed physical contact with an intern as a reason for banishing Acosta, but said he doesn't belong in the press room because he's essentially like an opinion columnist instead of a journalist.\n\nAcosta is a \"left-wing activist\" more interested in disrupting the president than in asking serious questions, said Brent Bozell, president of the conservative media watchdog Media Research Center.\n\n\"No one reporter has a constitutional right to access the press briefing room,\" Bozell said. \"It's the prerogative of the White House to decide who gets a pass and who does not.\n\nSanders noted that nearly 50 other people from CNN have White House passes.\n\nAcosta has been a polarizing figure even beyond the distaste that Trump and his supporters have for him. The Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank, editorialized last week that Acosta's encounter with Trump at the news conference \"was less about asking questions and more about making statements. In doing so, the CNN White House reporter gave President Donald Trump room to critique Acosta's professionalism.\"", "Hundreds of people filled a northern Indiana church to remember a missionary who was killed in Cameroon two weeks after arriving there with his wife and their eight children.\n\nCharles Wesco died Oct. 30 after he was shot in the head during fighting between armed separatists and soldiers in the West African nation. The Mishawaka man was sitting with his wife, Stephanie, in a car being driven by another missionary when he was shot.\n\nWesco was the older brother of Republican state Rep. Tim Wesco of Osceola (o-see-O'-la).\n\nThe South Bend Tribune reports that during Monday's memorial service at South Bend's Community Baptist Church, fellow missionary Tom Needham told mourners that Wesco's widow has already forgiven her husband's killer, saying she \"has no bitterness in her soul against anyone.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: South Bend Tribune, http://www.southbendtribune.com", "The U.S. government said it was starting work Tuesday to \"harden\" the border crossing from Tijuana, Mexico, to prepare for the arrival of a migrant caravan leapfrogging its way across western Mexico.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection announced it was closing four lanes at the busy San Ysidro and Otay Mesa ports of entry in San Diego, California.\n\nIt said the closures were needed \"to install and pre-position port hardening infrastructure equipment in preparation for the migrant caravan and the potential safety and security risk that it could cause.\"\n\nThat still leaves a substantial path for the tens of thousands of people who cross daily: Twenty-three lanes remain open at San Ysidro and 12 at Otay Mesa.\n\nSan Ysidro is the border's busiest crossing, with about 110,000 people entering the U.S. every day. That traffic includes some 40,000 vehicles, 34,000 pedestrians and 150 to 200 buses.\n\nA group of several hundred migrants moving ahead of the caravan made it to Tijuana on Tuesday aboard a fleet of buses.\n\nThe caravans became a campaign issue in U.S. midterm elections and U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of over 5,000 military troops to the border to help fend off the migrants. Trump has insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\n\nTo the thousands of Central American migrants making their way through Mexico's Pacific coast state of Nayarit, the prospect of meeting a hostile reception at the border is nothing new.\n\nAfter a month on the road, through three countries, migrants like Maribel, 22, from La Ceiba, Honduras, are used to tough conditions.\n\nMaribel, who did not want her last name used for fear of reprisals in Honduras, pushed a baby carriage with her 1-year-old daughter while her husband pushed another with their 3-year-old son along a highway leading from Guadalajara to the Nayarit state capital of Tepic. Few trucks passed, and migrants felt stranded.\n\n\"We are well aware of everything Trump has been saying,\" said Maribel. \"Let them close whatever they want to close, but we are going to get through anyway.\"\n\nAbout 1,300 migrants in a second caravan arrived in Mexico City, where they had their first day of rest in weeks Tuesday.\n\nRoberto Hernandez, 39, a bricklayer from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, was finally able to get a shot of antibiotics for the fever he has had for two weeks. He was staying at the same tent shelters set up for the first caravan at a sports stadium in Mexico City.\n\n\"Ever since I left home I knew it wasn't going to be easy,\" said Hernandez, who sobbed quietly as he thought of the two sons, Mateo and Steven, he left at home. \"They can put a million soldiers or whatever they want on the border, we are going to make the attempt to get across.\"\n\nBut things were especially tough for the first caravan. The estimated 6,000 Central Americans left shelters in Guadalajara early Tuesday and were taken by bus to a highway toll plaza to wait for rides to their next destination.\n\nThey thought other buses would be waiting for them to take them through hurricane-ravaged Nayarit to the neighboring state of Sinaloa, farther north. But no other buses showed up and few trucks passed to pick them up, leaving many to walk the 60 miles (90 kilometers) to the state line.\n\nMaria Antonia Martinez, 40, of Ocotepeque trudged along with her 7-year-old daughter after failing to get a ride.\n\n\"They told it was five kilometers (three miles), and that wasn't true,\" Martinez said, after walking five hours in the burning sun along an empty highway.\n\nLate Tuesday, hundreds were still stranded at the toll plaza and bedding down in its side lanes for the night. Those with better luck \u2014 the majority \u2014 made it as far as La Concha, in the Sinaloa state municipality of Escuinapa some 220 miles (356 kilometers) to the northwest.\n\nThe Rev. Miguel Angel Soto, director of the Casa de Migrante en Culiacan, said about 2,000 migrants had arrived in that area. He said the Sinaloa government, the Roman Catholic Church and Escuinapa officials were helping the migrants.\n\nThe priest also said the church had been able to get \"good people\" to provide buses for moving migrants northward. He said so far 24 buses had left Escuinapa on an eight-drive to Navojoa in Sonora state.\n\nThe first caravan appears intent on taking the Pacific coast route northward to the border city of Tijuana, which was still about 1,350 miles (2,200 kilometers) away. The migrants have come about 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) since they started out in Honduras around Oct. 13.\n\nHowever, some small groups broke off along the way and went on ahead, either using buses, trains or long-haul truck rides to get to the border quicker. Small groups were reported in the northern cities of Saltillo and Monterrey, in the region near Texas.\n\nThe Tijuana city government said Tuesday that about 350 migrants had arrived and were receiving food before being sent to shelters around the city.\n\nJason M-B Wells, executive director of the San Ysidro Chamber of Commerce, said Tuesday in an email that the Tijuana Secretary of Economic Development and local businesses had identified 3,000 jobs for migrants who decide to stay.\n\nMany say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.\n\nMexico has offered refuge, asylum or work visas, and its government said Monday that 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them during the 45-day application process for more permanent status. Some 533 migrants had requested a voluntary return to their countries, the government reported.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Mark Stevenson in Mexico City and Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.", "Macedonia will seek the arrest with an international warrant of conservative former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski after confirming he fled to Hungary to avoid serving a two-year prison sentence for corruption, authorities said Tuesday.\n\nThe Interior Ministry responded nearly five hours after Gruevski announced he was in Budapest in a post, as police continued searches in the capital Skopje to try and locate him.\n\nThe 48-year-old Gruevski who ignored a summons on Monday to appear at a Skopje prison to serve a two-year sentence after being convicted influencing officials to purchase a luxury car for government use. He also faces trial in four other cases that emerged from a wiretapping scandal which erupted in 2015 and plunged the country into a deep political crisis. He has been charged with abuse of office, electoral fraud, criminal association and incitement to violence.\n\nHe had surrendered his passport and it was unclear how he reached Hungary.\n\nGruevski was prime minister from 2006-2016. He is the former leader of the conservative VMRO-DPMNE party, which is the main opposition party which is allied with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's right-wing Fidesz party.\n\nContacted by The Associated Press, the Hungarian prime minister's office refused to confirm or deny Gruevski's presence, adding that \"ongoing asylum procedures\" couldn't be commented upon.\n\nGruevski's flight marks the latest dramatic episode in a volatile confrontation between his conservatives and Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's Social Democrats.\n\nThe two sides remain bitterly at odds over a proposed deal to change the republic's name to North Macedonia and end a dispute with neighboring Greece that would allow Macedonia to join NATO. Western leaders provided Zaev's government strong backing in supporting the deal, while Russia argued that it was the target of the alliance's expansion eastward.\n\nThe Social Democrats accused Gruevski of making a \"cowardly escape.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nPablo Gorondi reported from Budapest, Hungary", "The Trump administration Tuesday allowed states to provide more inpatient treatment for people with serious mental illness by tapping Medicaid, a potentially far-reaching move to address issues from homelessness to violence.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar made the announcement Tuesday in a speech to state Medicaid directors, a group that represents Republican and Democratic officials from around the country who are confronting common, deeply-rooted social problems.\n\nA longstanding federal law has barred Medicaid from paying for mental health treatment in facilities with more than 16 beds, to prevent \"warehousing\" of the mentally ill at the expense of federal taxpayers. Azar said states will now be able to seek waivers from that restriction, provided they can satisfy certain specific requirements.\n\n\"We have the worst of both worlds: limited access to inpatient treatment and limited access to other options,\" said Azar, who stressed that inpatient care has to be combined with community-based services.\n\n\"Given the history, it is the responsibility of state and federal governments together, alongside communities and families, to right this wrong,\" Azar added. \"More treatment options are needed, and that includes more inpatient and residential options that can help stabilize Americans with serious mental illness.\"\n\nMatt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors called it \"a hugely welcome development\" that will help states build out a range of services for the mentally ill.\n\nThe lack of in-patient treatment beds for people with mental illness is seen as a common denominator among several national problems: homelessness, police shootings, and acts of mass violence by people with serious mental problems.\n\nAdvocates said it may take a year or more to start seeing results of the new federal policy. States must apply for permission to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. They must demonstrate that their plans are part of a \"continuum\" or range of services for mentally ill people.\n\n\"We have decades of no movement on this issue,\" said John Snook, executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center, a nonprofit trying to broaden access to mental health treatment. \"This is the sort of opportunity we have to take advantage of.\n\n\"Every day there is a story about police having to shoot someone with serious mental illness or the glut of mentally ill people in the emergency room,\" Snook added. \"I think the general public will say the federal government is finally recognizing a problem we've been seeing on the ground.\"\n\nA decades-old law known as the \"IMD exclusion\" has stood in the way of Medicaid paying for treatment in larger mental health facilities. IMD stands for \"institution for mental diseases.\"\n\nPressure has been building on lawmakers and the administration to ease the restriction, given the combination of the opioid epidemic and recurring mass shootings, from Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut to the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, California.\n\nThe Obama administration began loosening restrictions in 2015 and last year the Trump administration cleared the way for Medicaid waivers to provide inpatient treatment for people with substance abuse problems.\n\nAzar said 13 such waivers have been approved and more are in the works. In Virginia, an expansion of residential drug treatment beds has been linked to a sharp drop in emergency room visits due to opioid overdose.\n\nOne concern about waiving the Medicaid restriction for mental health is that it could cause a spike in federal spending. Advocates respond that similar restrictions aren't imposed on other diseases, and that treatment may well save society money over the long run by avoiding other costs.\n\nMedicaid won't approve a mental health treatment waiver unless the state can show federal costs will be no greater than would have otherwise been the case absent a change.", "Kyrsten Sinema faced a lot of attacks during her historic \u2013 and ultimately successful -- bid for the open Senate seat in Arizona.\n\nPhotos of her protesting the Iraq War in a pink tutu, old audio clips that she said were taken out of context, accusations of treason and dirty negative ads implying the threat of imminent nuclear war if she is elected all played a role in the state\u2019s hotly contested race.\n\nBut in spite of the attacks, she won her race against her Republican opponent, Rep.

Sinema has dismissed the clips, and when McSally called her treasonous for her Taliban comment in a debate, Sinema said the attack was a reflection of McSally's approach to campaigning.\n\n\"Martha has chosen to run a campaign like the one you're seeing right now, where she's engaging in ridiculous attacks and smearing my campaign and she's just trying to cut-cut-cut and not share the full picture,\u201d said Sinema. \u201cMartha\u2019s trying to make this Senate campaign about me, but what we know is this campaign is about everyday Arizonans.\"\n\nIn at least four of her campaign ads, Sinema doesn't even note that she's a Democrat, describing herself instead as \"independent.\"\n\nSinema\u2019s record also shows that she votes with Republicans more often than most Democrats currently in Congress. According to 538\u2019s congressional tracker which evaluates how often members of Congress vote with the Trump administration, she has the fourth-highest record of any Democrat, and the highest percentage of any Democrat in Arizona.\n\nSinema voted with the Trump administration 62 percent of the time according to 538, which while high for a Democrat, is predictably lower than her Republican opponent McSally, who voted with the administration 98 percent of the time.\n\n\u201cWhen the president is doing something right, support him,\u201d explained Sinema during an Oct. 15 debate. \u201cWhen he's doing something wrong, oppose it.\u201d", "When Norma Weldon, a blind, 90-year-old woman, refused to evacuate her home as the deadly Camp Fire neared, her son, Brad Weldon, stayed behind to fight off the blaze.\n\nInterested in Wildfires?

District Court, lawyers for CNN argued the \"revocation of Acosta's credentials is only the beginning.\"\n\n\"This severe and unprecedented punishment is the culmination of years of hostility by President Trump against CNN and Acosta based on the contents of their reporting\u2014an unabashed attempt to censor the press and exclude reporters from the White House who challenge and dispute the President\u2019s point of view,\" CNN's lawyers wrote in the court documents.\n\nJonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nThe president \"lacks the authority to quash\" the First Amendment, the lawyers wrote, and access to the White House cannot be denied arbitrarily.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, CNN and Acosta aim to \"enforce this constitutional commitment, restore Acosta\u2019s well-deserved press credentials, and ensure that the press remains free to question the government and to report the business of the nation to the American people.\"\n\nSanders, in a response from the White House, called the lawsuit \"more grandstanding from CNN\" and vowed to \"vigorously defend\" against the lawsuit.\n\nCNN has nearly 50 additional \"hard pass\" holders, a common name for White House press credentials, Sanders said, and Acosta is \"no more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the First Amendment,\" which Sanders argued is not served when one reporter \"attempts to monopolize the floor.\"\n\n\"The White House cannot run an orderly and fair press conference when a reporter acts this way, which is neither appropriate nor professional,\" Sanders continued. \"If there is no check on this type of behavior it impedes the ability of the President, the White House staff, and members of the media to conduct business.\u201d\n\nSanders' comments Tuesday differ from her explanation last week of Acosta's press pass suspension.

We continue to urge the Administration to reverse course and fully reinstate CNN\u2019s correspondent. The President of the United States should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him,\" Knox said.\n\nThe White House suspended press access for Acosta after he and Trump engaged in a heated exchange during a press conference on Wednesday, one day after the midterm elections.\n\nAcosta began by asking about language the president used about a caravan of migrants from Central America, many of whom say they're fleeing violence, headed to the U.S. border.\n\n\"Honestly, I think you should let me run the country, you run CNN, and if you did it well, your ratings would be much better,\" Trump told Acosta.\n\nAcosta then asked the president a question about the Russia investigation.

That was unusual, as the ancient Greeks typically buried their dead in organized cemeteries outside the city walls.\n\nLead archaeologist Elena Korka, who has been excavating in the area since 2013, told The Associated Press that her team had only been digging in the rich cemeteries surrounding Tenea until this year. In one, antiquities smugglers dug up two remarkable 6th century B.C. marble statues of young men in 2010 and tried to sell them for 10 million euros.\n\n\"This year we excavated part of the city itself,\" Korka said.\n\nExcavation work continues on the cemeteries, located near the modern village of Hiliomodi about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Athens.\n\nArchaeologists discovered nine burials there this year, finding gold, copper and bone jewelry, pottery and coins dating from the 4th century B.C. to Roman times.\n\n\"The citizens seem to have been remarkably affluent,\" Korka said, adding that the city probably did well out of trade, standing on a key route between the major cities of Corinth and Argos in the northeastern Peloponnese.\n\nSo far, not much was known about Tenea, apart from ancient references to the reputed link with Troy and to its citizens having formed the bulk of the Greek colonists who founded the city of Syracuse in Sicily.\n\nKorka said more should emerge during the excavations, which will continue over coming years.\n\n\"(The city) had distinctive pottery shapes with eastern influences, maintained contacts with both east and west ... and had its own way of thinking, which, to the extent that it could, shaped its own policies,\" she said.\n\nTenea survived the Roman destruction of neighboring Corinth in 146 B.C., and flourished under Roman rule.

He said the Shiite militant group bears full responsibility for the consequences, including Lebanon's flagging economy.\n\nHariri stopped short of resigning, however, saying there was still an opportunity to bridge the differences.\n\nHariri, the top Sunni Muslim leader in the country, is coming under increasing pressure from the Iranian-backed Shiite Hezbollah, which insists that six Sunni legislators allied with Hezbollah be represented in the new Cabinet. Hariri flatly rejects the demand, saying the six independent legislators are not part of a parliamentary bloc and are therefore not entitled to have a minister in the cabinet.\n\n\"The truth is that government formation has hit a big obstacle,\" Hariri said.\n\nLebanon held its first parliamentary elections in nine years in May but political bickering over the distribution has stood in the way of government formation.\n\nGiving Hariri's Sunni opponents a Cabinet seat is the latest delay in the formation after months of negotiations gave the right-wing Christian Lebanese Forces four cabinet seats, including that of deputy prime minister. Hezbollah will likely get three seats, the biggest number of ministers ever for the group, including the health ministry.\n\nSome analysts link Hezbollah's insistence on representing the independent Sunni legislators in the Cabinet to a new wave of U.S. sanctions against its patron Iran that went into effect on Nov 5.\n\nHariri insisted however that the obstacles were not linked to external politics.\n\nFurther delays in the government are increasing pressure on the country's struggling economy and endanger international donors' pledges of $11 billion in loans and grants to help debt-ridden Lebanon.

Gunfire erupted and six people died. Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa set up a commission of inquiry, headed by former South African president Kgalema Motlanthe, to probe the killings.\n\nDespite widely published photos and video showing the Zimbabwean army soldiers firing on people in Harare's streets, the generals said under oath that they do not believe the troops shot at people.\n\n\"I do not believe that any of the soldiers fired. Yes, they fired in the air, but I do not believe any could have aimed shots at the civilians. I have no reason to believe that one of the soldiers could have shot and killed those people,\" said Zimbabwe Defense Forces Commander Gen. Philip Valerio Sibanda, during the nationally televised hearing.\n\nThe tactical commander of the military unit, Gen. Anselem Sanyatwe, told the commission he suspected \"militant\" opposition activists who deserted from the army could have shot at protesters, a claim repeated by Sibanda.\n\nWhen presented with a photo of a kneeling soldier who appeared to be aiming at protesters, Sanyatwe said the man \"took that position because he was avoiding missiles that were being thrown at him.\"\n\nSome inquiry commissioners and people in the public gallery were visibly stunned by the generals' denials.\n\n\"Is that your evidence?\" asked Lovemore Madhuku, one of the commissioners, adding that evidence by other witnesses showed that the shootings coincided with the military's deployment.\n\nSibanda countered that he had \"heard gunfire well before the troops deployed.\"\n\nMotlanthe said the generals' denials contradicted evidence so far received by the commission from other witnesses who include victims.\n\nPolice testified that they have not turned up information that would determine who killed the civilians. The police have not retrieved any cartridges from the city center where the shooting took place, do not have any suspects and have not made any arrests, said Police Detective Chief Inspector Edmore Runganga, who is leading investigations into the Aug. 1 killings.\n\nCrisis in Zimbabwe Coalition, a local non-governmental organization on Tuesday said it is \"perturbed by the misleading evidence presented by top army and police officers. ... We note an apparent attempt to blame the opposition, business and ordinary citizens for the shootings and this will likely lead to a witch-hunt that will see continued persecution of hundreds of activists that were arrested in the aftermath of the killings,\" said the organization in a statement.\n\n\"The army did not shoot at anyone, like seriously?

He misrepresented the French leader's comments along the way, even though the two presidents had talked through the issue while Trump was in France over the weekend for events marking the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.\n\n\"Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia,\" Trump tweeted. \"But it was Germany in World Wars One & Two - How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along. Pay for NATO or not!\"\n\nIn fact, Macron had said Europe needs to protect itself against cyberthreats from China, Russia and the U.S. The French leader's office said Trump had lumped together Macron's remarks on protecting against cyberthreats with a later statement on military defense.\n\nGerard Araud, France's ambassador to the U.S., challenged Trump, tweeting, \"For the sake of truth, Pres.@EmmanuelMacron didn't say that EU needed an army 'against the US'.\"\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, meanwhile, told European Union lawmakers Tuesday \"that we have to work on the vision of one day creating a real European army.\" She underscored that such a force would not mean the end of the U.S.-led NATO military alliance.\n\nThe president has long complained that NATO countries don't pay their fair share of the defense alliance's expenses, leaving the U.S. to carry much of the burden. Burden-sharing was among the topics that Trump and Macron discussed during a meeting Saturday at the Elysee Palace.\n\nA top adviser to Macron said Tuesday that the French position has been \"clarified.\" Macron explained the European army issue to Trump during their meeting, stressing that France was not making a choice between a European defense mechanism and multilateral organizations such as NATO, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with French customs.\n\nTrump also complained Tuesday about tariffs on U.S. wines sold in France, saying it's \"not fair, must change!\" And he appeared to take a dig at Macron's low public approval rating. Trump's standing with the French is lower than Macron's.\n\n\"On Trade, France makes excellent wine, but so does the U.S. The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France, and charges big Tariffs, whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines, and charges very small Tariffs. Not fair, must change!\"\n\nNearly all U.S. wine exports to major markets, including the European Union \u2014 of which France is a part \u2014 face tariffs, according to the Wine Institute, which represents California winemakers in Washington on matters of tax, trade and regulatory issues.\n\nTrump, a former businessman, opened a winery in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2011.\n\n\"The problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low Approval Rating in France, 26%, and an unemployment rate of almost 10%. He was just trying to get onto another subject. By the way, there is no country more Nationalist than France, very proud people-and rightfully so! ... MAKE FRANCE GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\nMacron is hovering at around 30 percent in popularity polls, while the unemployment rate is just above 9 percent.\n\nTrump appeared to be referring to Macron's comment Sunday during a speech for the World War I centennial in which he decried the rise of nationalism around the globe, calling it a \"betrayal of patriotism.\" The comments were widely viewed as a rebuke of Trump, who sat stone-faced in the company of other world leaders as Macron spoke. Trump has embraced the \"nationalist\" label despite its negative connotations.\n\nTrump's continued complaints about France and Macron hit a nerve with some in the European nation, especially since Trump delivered his latest broadsides on the third anniversary of the Paris terror attacks that killed 130 people in 2015.\n\nThe complaints were another marker of the up-and-down relationship between Trump and Macron since they first met last year.\n\nTrump also defended his decision to cancel a trip Saturday to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery at Belleau Wood in northern France after rainy weather grounded his helicopter.

He is also being charged with three cases of serious bodily harm.\n\nWolsztajn worked for various Poland and Slovakia-based temp agencies in at least 68 locations across Germany since 2015, often staying only for short periods of time.\n\nThe suspect is alleged to have sought out vulnerable patients in order to steal their belongings. When he failed to find valuables he would quit his job and seek a new position elsewhere.\n\nPolice believe further crimes were averted by the man's arrest in February on suspicion of one killing, saying: \"The accused already had new positions lined up.\"\n\nGerman authorities initially reached out to police in England amid concerns that Wolsztajn may also have committed crimes there. But a spokesman for Munich police, Florian Hirschauer, said investigators determined this wasn't the case.\n\nThe suspect is believed to have started injecting the patients, aged between 66 and 91, with insulin only after he himself was prescribed the diabetes drug and informed of the risk of overdoses in January 2017, police said.\n\nThe case echoes that of a former hospital nurse, Niels Hoegel, accused of killing 100 patients at two hospitals in Germany over a decade ago.

About two-thirds of the boys have their right arms raised in the gesture, many grinning widely.\n\n\"The optics aren't good,\" Gust told The Associated Press, though he said he didn't believe the boys were doing a Nazi salute: \"There was never any inkling of that whatsoever. ... There was nothing intended in any way shape or form to simulate anything that was offensive to anyone.\"\n\nGust maintained that his camera merely caught the boys' wave prematurely, saying his \"regret is I didn't get to the apex.\"\n\nMany viewers of the photo felt strongly otherwise, with criticism pouring in from individuals and from Jewish organizations including the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum in Poland.\n\nOne of the students in the photo also rejected the suggestion that the gestures were anything but a Nazi salute. Jordan Blue, who is pictured without expression and with his arms down, said he believes some of the students did intend to make the salute as a joke.\n\n\"It was very disrespectful to what my beliefs are, and it was a very bad representation of the senior class and the Baraboo School District, because by all means, the Baraboo School District does not support that kind of actions and it is a district that provides many opportunities for the students,\" Blue told the Baraboo News Republic. \"This is something that I will never forget.\"\n\nGust had posted the photo to his photography business website, Wheel Memories, after it was taken in May. He took it down Monday and posted an apology after it surfaced in social media posts and was shared widely.\n\nThe Baraboo School District said it was looking into the matter, and local police said they are helping with that investigation.\n\n\"If the gesture is what it appears to be, the district will pursue any and all available and appropriate actions, including legal, to address the issue,\" district Superintendent Lori Mueller said in a letter to parents Monday.\n\nAbout a half-dozen speakers addressed the matter Monday night at a school board meeting. Kevin Vodak, the board's president, said the photo \"deeply disappointed me, shamed, appalled and angered me.\"\n\n\"The photo has shaken to the core my personal belief of the process that we as a community and as a school district have made to be tolerant, inclusive, accepting and admitting of all of those who are different from ourselves,\" he added.\n\nEarlier Monday, about 100 people gathered near the courthouse for a unity rally organizers said was aimed at sending a positive message about Baraboo, a community of 12,000 some 115 miles (185 kilometers) northwest of Milwaukee.\n\n\"The point is to show Baraboo is about love,\" said organizer Sherri Schaaf.\n\nOfficials at the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum tweeted their criticism of the photo on Monday.\n\n\"This is why every single day we work hard to educate.

The closest watched runoff race is in Jerusalem, Israel's proclaimed capital and a place of pilgrimage for billions around the world. While the city's mayor has little influence over Middle East politics and diplomacy, he presides over the day-to-day life in the hotbed of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and has a strong symbolic presence both nationally and internationally.\n\nThe polls were taking place amid the most serious violence between Israel and the Islamic militant Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, since they fought a 2014 war. An election in one regional council in southern Israel near the Gaza border was postponed because of the incessant rocket fire and the violence could drive down voter turnout in other locations near Gaza.\n\nJerusalem is Israel's poorest city. Its diverse population is split nearly evenly between Palestinians Arabs, ultra-Orthodox Jews and the rest of the Jewish residents \u2014 both secular and observant.\n\nWith the incumbent Nir Barkat stepping down to run for national office, a quartet of candidates squared off in an ugly campaign to replace him. The runoff features Moshe Lion, a longtime political fixture backed by much of the country's top leadership, facing off against Ofer Berkovitch, a young secular activist pushing a progressive agenda against religious hard-liners.\n\nLion, a former director general of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office in the 1990s, enjoys the support of key ultra-Orthodox factions and their representatives in government, as well as that of Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman and powerful figures in the ruling Likud party. But he has little grassroots support of his own and failed to place even a single representative in the municipal council.\n\nThe 35-year-old Berkovitch heads a joint group of secular and modern-Orthodox Jews that makes up the largest block of the incoming council. He has also been buoyed by a historic split in the ultra-Orthodox electorate, which did not vote en masse in the first round. Many leading rabbis have refrained from endorsing a final candidate and some Hassidic Jews, whose own hopeful failed to advance to the runoff, have vowed to vote for the secular Berkovitch \u2014 previously a seemingly improbable prospect.\n\nAvishai Cohen, who heads Berkovitch's ultra-Orthodox branch, says it's the result of vast changes in the community, with a younger generation more open to change and less reliant on the stringent all-encompassing edicts of rabbinical authorities. With many now joining the military and the modern workforce in growing numbers, he said it was natural they would also break out of their traditional voting patterns.\n\n\"There is a groundswell toward real leadership,\" Cohen said at a makeshift campaign office where he tried to convince fellow ultra-Orthodox to vote for his candidate. \"I'm here to show that there is another kind of ultra-Orthodox Jew.\"\n\nFew Palestinians vote since most consider participation as recognition of Israeli control over east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 war and annexed in a move not recognized internationally. So the result will likely come down to ultra-Orthodox turnout and how many flip to Berkovitch's side.\n\nEither way, the winner is going to have to deal with deep divisions in the city after a hotly contested campaign.\n\n\"The number one challenge is of course the diversity of the city. Jerusalem has a very unique demographic structure, therefore every mayor who is elected will have to find a way to embrace the other side,\" said Lior Schillat, the director general of the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research, a non-partisan think-tank.\n\nElsewhere in Israel, runoffs will take place in Rishon Lezion, the country's fourth largest city, and several other major cities.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Heller at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap", "An independent Russian magazine has raised over $370,000 to pay a fine to the government.\n\nThe New Times magazine was fined 22 million rubles last month for failing to notify authorities on time of receiving foreign funding.

The water is treated and stored in large tanks.\n\nMore than 7 \u00bd years since the accident, officials have yet to agree on what to do with the radioactive water. A government-commissioned panel has picked five alternatives, including the controlled release of the water into the Pacific Ocean, which nuclear experts say is the only realistic option. Fishermen and residents, however, strongly oppose the proposal.\n\nThat option faced a major setback this summer when the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., acknowledged that the water, which it said had been carefully treated, was not clean enough. It said the water contains cancer-causing cesium and other elements in excess of allowable limits for release into the environment.\n\nThe IAEA interim report said TEPCO could run out of space for tanks in a few years, and the water storage adds to safety risks and could hamper the decommissioning of the plant, which is already an unprecedented challenge.\n\nIt said the water problem has improved recently because of measures such as an underground frozen wall installed around the reactor buildings to keep the radioactive water from mixing with groundwater. It suggested that TEPCO could further reduce the amount of contaminated water by cutting back on the use of cooling water injected into the reactors because the temperature of the melted fuel has fallen significantly.\n\nIAEA mission leader Christophe Xerri told reporters that it is uncertain whether all of the melted fuel can ever be successfully removed because too little is known about the damage to the cores of the three reactors.\n\nTEPCO and government officials plan to start removing the melted fuel in 2021. Robotic probes inside the reactors have detected traces of damaged fuel but its exact location, contents and other details remain largely unknown.\n\n\"If you don't have the information it's very difficult to say it's possible or not\" to remove all the fuel, Xerri said.\n\nThe team's final report from its review is expected in late January.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi", "Johnson Controls International PLC is selling its power solutions division to Brookfield Business Partners LP for $13.2 billion.\n\nThe power solutions business, which makes and distributes advanced battery technologies for various vehicles, posted $8 billion in revenue in fiscal 2018.\n\nJohnson Controls CEO George Oliver said Tuesday the sale will let the company streamline its business, provide increased financial flexibility to strengthen its balance sheet, return capital to shareholders and create options in its buildings unit.\n\nCork, Ireland-based Johnson Controls anticipates using $3 billion to $3.5 billion of the $11.4 billion in proceeds from the sale to pay down debt.\n\nThe deal is targeted to close by June 30, 2019.", "A 94-year-old former SS concentration guard on trial on hundreds of counts of accessory to murder painted himself Tuesday as an unwilling participant in the Nazi machinery of death.\n\nJohann Rehbogen is accused of working as a guard at the Stutthof concentration camp east of Danzig, which is today the Polish city of Gdansk, from June 1942 to about early September 1944.\n\nIn a statement read by his attorney, the defendant told the Muenster state court he was \"not a Nazi.\"\n\n\"I've never been one and I'll never be one in the little time that I still have left to live,\" he said, the dpa news agency reported.\n\nAs an ethnic German from Romania, Rehbogen said he had ended up in the German military but had not volunteered to serve in the SS.\n\n\"As a Christian it was hard for me to be part of all of it,\" he said in the statement. \"But I was too scared to protest.\"\n\nRehbogen was 18 at the time, and is being tried in a youth court because of his age during the years of his alleged offenses. He faces a maximum 10 years in prison if convicted.\n\nHe told the court he was ashamed of his actions, occasionally wiping tears from his eyes as the statement was read, but that he had feared he would be branded an enemy of the Nazi state and persecuted if he protested.\n\n\"I cannot say with certainty, with today's perspective, whether I would have had the courage to act differently,\" he said.\n\nThough there is no evidence linking the former SS Sturmmann \u2014 roughly equivalent to the U.S. Army rank of specialist \u2014 to a specific crime, the prosecution argues that, as a guard, he was an accessory to the killings at Stutthof while he was there. In all, more than 60,000 people were killed in the camp.\n\nAs the trial opened last week, prosecutor Andreas Brendel detailed how prisoners were killed by being given lethal injections of gasoline or phenol directly to their hearts, shot or starved. Others were forced outside in winter without clothes until they died of exposure, or put to death in a gas chamber.\n\nRehbogen said he was unaware of a gas chamber in the camp but suggested he did at least know prisoners were being mistreated.\n\n\"The prisoners were in a terrible state, I was ashamed,\" he said in his statement. \"Pity would be the wrong word; it's difficult to find the right words. We were not indifferent to the fate of the prisoners. I had great difficulty coming to terms with it.\"\n\nHe didn't apologize to the victims of the camp, but said he didn't expect their sympathy for his own plight.\n\n\"If I present things here today that for me at the time were unpleasant or difficult to bear, I know that in comparison to the unspeakable suffering of the camp inmates it was minimal,\" he said.", "His nickname means \"shorty,\" but the list of crimes attributed to Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman -- including drug trafficking, murder and torture -- is lengthy and spelled out in a 17-count indictment that forms the backbone of a trial that started Tuesday in Brooklyn federal court with opening statements.\n\nInterested in \"El Chapo\" Guzman?

But Wickremesinghe insisted his firing was unconstitutional. He refused to vacate his official residence and demanded that Parliament be summoned to prove he still has support.\n\nAmid mounting pressure from political opponents and foreign governments, including the United States and the EU, to convene Parliament to end the impasse, Sirisena announced the legislature would return this Wednesday.\n\nBut last Friday, he instead dissolved Parliament and called new elections in January. Opponents said Sirisena made the decision because Rajapaksa had been unable to assemble a majority.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled Tuesday to suspend the president's order until Dec. 7, after 13 political parties and individuals filed petitions with the court calling the dissolution unconstitutional. It said it would hold hearings on the case starting Dec. 4.\n\nWickremesinghe welcomed the ruling, calling it \"a resounding victory for people's franchise.\"\n\n\"The powers of the president are limited. The president must act according to the law, he is not above the law,\" he said.\n\nHours after the court's ruling, the office of the speaker of Parliament announced that lawmakers would meet at 10 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nWickremesinghe said he was ready to \"show that we have the majority and that we are the legitimate government of Sri Lanka.\"\n\nAfter the ruling was announced, hundreds of opposition supporters who had gathered near the court cheered and lit firecrackers.\n\nJehan Perera, executive director of the National Peace Council of Sri Lanka, said the order \"proves that Sri Lanka's judiciary is independent and that they were prepared to give a judgment that went against the executive.\"\n\n\"That's a positive indication of the continuing strength of Sri Lanka's institutions and their independence which is important to the sustenance of our democracy,\" he added.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister. Sirisena has also accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, a charge Wickremesinghe has repeatedly denied.\n\nSirisena was also critical of investigations into military personnel who were accused of human rights violations during Sri Lanka's 25-year civil war against a Tamil separatist group, which ended in 2009.\n\nRajapaksa, who was president from 2005 to 2015, is considered a hero by some in Sri Lanka's ethnic Sinhalese majority for ending the war by crushing the Tamil rebels.\n\nBut his time in power was marred by allegations of war-time atrocities, corruption and nepotism.", "The two communities that learned Tuesday they are about to become homes to a pair of big, new East Coast bases for Amazon are both riverfront stretches of major metropolitan areas with ample transportation and space for workers.\n\nBut there are plenty of differences between New York's Long Island City and Crystal City in northern Virginia.\n\nSet within eyeshot of the nation's capital, Crystal City is a thicket of 1980s-era office towers trying to plug into new economic energy after thousands of federal jobs moved elsewhere.\n\nRapidly growing Long Island City is an old manufacturing area already being reinvented as a hub for 21st-century industry, creativity and urbane living.\n\nSeattle-based Amazon, which set out last year to situate one additional headquarters, announced Tuesday that it was splitting its project into two.\n\nA look at the two communities:\n\nLONG ISLAND CITY\n\nIt's already the fastest-developing neighborhood in the nation's most populous city, and Amazon could pump up the volume in this buzzy part of Queens.\n\nThe addition of Amazon to the neighborhood stands to burnish New York City's reputation as a tech capital. Landing Amazon also cements Long Island City's transformation from a faded manufacturing zone to a vibrant, of-the-moment enclave of waterfront skyscrapers, modernized warehouses and artsy-tech ambience across the East River from midtown Manhattan.\n\n\"I joke that we're experiencing explosive growth 30 years in the making,\" said Elizabeth Lusskin, president of the Long Island City Partnership, a neighborhood development group.\n\nBut Long Island City also has been straining to handle its growth.\n\nDays before Tuesday's announcement , the city unveiled a $180 million plan to address Long Island City's packed schools, street design and a sewage system that groans in heavy rain. But those projects will just catch up with current needs, said area City Councilman Jimmy van Bramer.\n\n\"I know that there are a lot of people cheerleading for this, but HQ2 has to work for Queens and the people of Queens. It can't just be good for Amazon,\" said van Bramer, a Democrat. After the announcement, he said Amazon had \"duped New York into offering unprecedented amounts of tax dollars to one of the wealthiest companies on Earth.\"\n\nOnce a bustling factory and freight-moving area, Long Island City saw many of its plants and warehouses closed as manufacturing shriveled in New York City.\n\nThe neighborhood's rebirth began in the 1980s, when officials broached redeveloping a swath of the waterfront, while artists were drawn by warehouse spaces, affordable rents and a building that is now the MoMA PS1 museum. Silvercup Studios \u2014 where such TV shows as \"Sex and the City,\" ''30 Rock\" and \"The Sopranos\" have been filmed \u2014 opened in 1983.\n\nLong Island City gained a new commercial stature, and the start of a high-rise skyline, when the banking giant now called Citi opened an office tower there in 1989. But the area's growth lately has been driven by residential building.\n\nSome 9,150 new apartments and homes have been built since 2010, more than in any other New York City neighborhood, according to the city Planning Department . Thousands more units are in the works.\n\nThe location identified by the state as the spot for Amazon's new campus is currently a collection of low-rise industrial buildings and parking lots wrapped around a boat basin.\n\nNew York has striven for nearly a decade to position itself as a tech hotspot.\n\nVenture capitalists poured $5.8 billion into New York-area startups last quarter, more than any other region except the San Francisco area, according to the consulting and accounting firm PwC . Established tech giants, including Google and Facebook, have been expanding their New York footprints.\n\nStill, landing HQ2 represents \"incredible validation of just how far New York has come,\" said Jonathan Bowles, executive director of the Center for an Urban Future think tank.\n\nWaiting for a subway, Long Island City community board chairwoman Denise Keehan-Smith could envision Amazon benefiting the neighborhood.\n\n\"But I think we have to be careful about it,\" she said.\n\nCRYSTAL CITY\n\nIf any place in America can absorb 25,000 Amazon jobs without disruption, it may well be Crystal City, Virginia, where nearly that many jobs have vanished over the last 15 years.\n\nThe neighborhood in Arlington County is bounded by the Potomac River and the nation's capital on one side, by the Pentagon on another and Reagan National Airport on a third.\n\nDespite its prime location and abundant transportation options, the neighborhood has been hit by a massive outflow of jobs. The Patent and Trademark Office began moving more than 7,000 jobs out of Crystal City in 2003. In 2005, the Defense Department announced plans to move roughly 17,000 jobs elsewhere as part of a base realignment.\n\nArlington County has worked hard to bring in new employers, and had some success. The Public Broadcasting Service moved its headquarters to Crystal City in 2006.\n\nStill, large swaths of the neighborhood remain vacant. Among other challenges, the area has fought to overcome a reputation for outdated architecture.\n\nCrystal City is populated by '70s and '80s-era office buildings. The buildings are connected by a network of tunnels populated with food-court style dining options, hair salons and newsstands. The tunnels leave the ground-level outdoor streetscape sometimes looking empty.\n\nBrookings Institution urban planner Jenny Schuetz suggested the buildings may require an upgrade, or even replacement. But she noted that while people often associate tech companies with converted lofts or state-of-the art workspaces, many big Silicon Valley tech companies actually work out of '80s-era office buildings.\n\nFor all the talk about antiquated architecture, people who've actually worked in Crystal City appreciate its convenience and its worker-friendly features, including the tunnels.\n\n\"I loved it here,\" said Christine Gentry of Greenbelt, Maryland, as she ate breakfast in a largely empty food court. She works for the Patent and Trademark Office and preferred the days when her office was in Crystal City.\n\n\"Everything is accessible here,\" she said. \"When it was raining or snowing or sleeting, I never had to go out.\"\n\nPerhaps no place better illustrates the vibe of Crystal City than the region's only revolving restaurant, the Skydome atop the Doubletree Crystal City. Diners enjoy a panoramic view of the D.C. skyline, completing a full rotation every 47 minutes.\n\nSam Getachew, the hotel's food and beverage manager, said the restaurant fits the neighborhood's retro atmosphere.\n\n\"It's huge draw,\" Getachew said. \"People come for the curiosity of it.\"\n\nThe only downside, he said, is that \"when customers get up to go to the restroom, they don't know where they are when they come back.\"\n\nWhen Amazon announced its plans Tuesday, it said its footprint will extend beyond Crystal City into the adjacent neighborhoods of Pentagon City and Potomac Yard, which have collectively been dubbed \"National Landing\" by the region's economic development officials.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBarakat reported from Arlington, Virginia.", "German authorities say a male nurse is suspected of killing six elderly patients, and attempting to kill at least three more over almost a year.\n\nMunich police said Tuesday that the 36-year-old Polish man has admitted during questioning to injecting twelve people in his care with unnecessary insulin shots from April 2017 to February. He denies intending to kill them.\n\nThe suspect, previously identified as Grzegorz Stanislaw Wolsztajn, is alleged to have sought out vulnerable patients in order to steal their belongings. When he failed to find valuables he would quit his job and seek a new position elsewhere.\n\nPolice believe further crimes were averted by the man's arrest in February on suspicion of one killing, saying: \"The accused already had new positions lined up.\"\n\nThe investigation is ongoing.", "Amazon is hard to escape.\n\nWhether you've bought shoes at Zappos, picked up milk at Whole Foods or listened to an audiobook on Audible, you've been caught up in Amazon's growing web of businesses.\n\nAnd now, Amazon's sprawling empire will stretch even further. The company announced Tuesday that it will open two more bases outside of its Seattle headquarters: one in Arlington, Virginia and the other in New York's Long Island City neighborhood.\n\nAmazon, which got its start as an online bookstore two decades ago, has grown to a behemoth that had nearly $180 billion in revenue last year. Its workforce has ballooned to more than 610,000 employees worldwide, making it the second largest U.S.-based, publicly-traded employer behind Walmart, according to FactSet. That growth has also made its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos one of the world's richest people, with his stake in Amazon worth more than $135 billion.\n\nHere's a look at some of the various businesses Amazon has its hand in:\n\nONLINE SHOPPING\n\nOnline sales are still Amazon's biggest money maker, bringing in $108 billion in revenue last year. That's slightly more than 60 percent of its total revenue.\n\nBesides Amazon.com, it also owns several smaller sites, including shoe retailer Zappos.com, rare books seller AbeBooks.com, deal site 6pm.com and women's clothing retailer Shopbop. It recently began selling medication after purchasing online pharmacy PillPack in September for $753 million.\n\nPHYSICAL STORES\n\nAmazon's largest brick-and-mortar push was its nearly $14 billion purchase of Whole Foods last year, giving it about 500 grocery stores.\n\nIt has created its own shops, too. There are 18 Amazon bookstores, five cashier-less convenience stores and three 4-star stores, which sell toys, cookware and other items. There are also dozens of Amazon pop-up shops inside malls and Kohl's department stores where shoppers can touch and try out its gadgets.\n\nIts physical locations had revenue of $13 billion in the first nine months of 2018.\n\nWEB SERVICES\n\nThere's more to Amazon than just shopping. Its Amazon Web Services unit, founded in 2006, provides cloud computing services to corporations and government agencies, and is one of Amazon's fastest growing businesses.\n\nIt had revenue of $17 billion last year, about 10 percent of its total revenue.\n\nADVERTISING\n\nThe ads at the top of Amazon search results are becoming a big business for the company. Amazon doesn't say exactly how much revenue it makes from ads, but an executive said that ad revenue makes up the majority of the \"other revenue\" listed in its financial reports. In its most recent quarter, its \"other revenue\" was $2.5 billion, more than double its revenue in the same period the year before.\n\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\n\nAmazon Prime is a way to cement customer loyalty and get them to spend more on the site. For $119 a year or $12.99 a month, members get free shipping, access to its video streaming service and other perks. The company disclosed for the first time earlier this year that it had more than 100 million paid Prime subscribers worldwide. Revenue from subscriptions topped $9.7 billion last year.\n\nGADGETS\n\nAmazon has been churning out some successful gadgets, including: Kindle tablets, Echo voice-activated speakers and Fire TV video streaming devices. The company doesn't break out revenue for these products.\n\nHOLLYWOOD STUDIO\n\nAmazon produces TV shows for its video streaming service, such as Emmy-winning \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\" and films, such as \"Manchester by the Sea.\" Amazon doesn't break out revenue for its studio.\n\nVIDEO GAMES, AUDIOBOOKS AND MORE\n\nAmazon also owns Twitch, a video streaming service for gamers; Audible, the audiobooks seller; and IMDb.com, an online database of movie and TV show starts, directors and other information. Amazon doesn't break out revenue for these businesses.\n\nAMAZON BRANDS\n\nInstead of relying on famous brands, Amazon has been creating its own. It designs sofas for its Rivet brand, men's shirts for Goodthreads and batteries for AmazonBasics. Amazon has about 130 private label brands, according to TJI Research, which tracks Amazon and its businesses.", "A Saudi Arabian intelligence official was \"shocked\" after listening to an audio recording of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi's murder during a recent visit to Istanbul, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said.\n\nErdogan described the content of the recording as a \"calamity\" and insisted that Riyadh take decisive action against Khashoggi's alleged killers, according to a report in Turkey's Hurriyet Daily newspaper.\n\nSpeaking to local media last night while returning to Istanbul from Armistice Day ceremonies in Paris, Erdogan claimed the unnamed Saudi official \"was shocked after he listened to the recording and he uttered that 'only a person on heroin can commit such an action,'\" as the Daily Sabah reported.\n\nErdogan did not elaborate on how and when the Saudi official listened to the recording.\n\nA source close to Turkish intelligence authorities confirmed to ABC News that Saudi Arabia's chief prosecutor, Saud al Mojeb, was played the audio recordings by Turkish intelligence officers last month during an investigative trip to Istanbul.\n\nA story in The New York Times reported Turkish authorities claimed a member of the assassination team instructed a superior over the phone to \"tell your boss\" the operatives had completed the mission. The Times article attributed this information to three people familiar with recordings of Khashoggi's murder. The New York Times article also said American intelligence officers believe the \"boss\" in the that phone conversation refers to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de-facto ruler of the Saudi Kingdom.\n\nThe Times report went on to claim that a recording was shared last month with CIA director Gina Haspel and is considered by intelligence officials as some of the strongest evidence linking Mohammed to Khashoggi's murder.\n\nReinforcing an assertion he made over the weekend, Erdogan said last night that Saudi Arabia, the U.S., France, Canada, Germany and the U.K. have been given audio recordings of the murder and said they are patiently waiting for the Saudis to shed light on the issue \"as promised by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\"\n\nErdogan said that he discussed the Khashoggi murder with U.S. President Donald Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron during a dinner in Paris and told them it was obvious that Khashoggi's murder was ordered and instructed by the high echelons of the Saudi hierarchy. \"From their reactions I believe they were disturbed about it too,\" Erdogan said to Hurriyet.\n\nErdogan added that he told Mr. Trump \"there is no need to look elsewhere for the murderers since they are surely among the 18 people detained by Saudi authorities, including the 15-member team that came to Istanbul before Khashoggi's disappearance.\"\n\nKhashoggi was a Saudi citizen and a resident of the United States who wrote columns for the Washington Post critical of bin Salman. He was reported missing by his fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz, after entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to obtain marriage documents on Oct. 2.\n\nAt the end of October, al-Mojeb made headlines during his visit to Istanbul by admitting that the killing of Khashoggi was premeditated, contradicting a previous official statement from Riyadh saying it was an accident.\n\nAt around the same time in late October, a Turkish prosecutor publicly revealed shocking details of the murder, claiming Khashoggi was strangled as soon as he stepped into the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul and that his body was dismembered.\n\nA statement from the Turkish prosecutor, Irfan Fidan, said Khashoggi's killing was planned in advance.\n\nErdogan said last night that Turkish authorities have asked the Saudis where they disposed of Khashoggi's body and are still waiting for a response.", "One of Norway's Navy frigates has almost completely gone under water after an oil tanker rammed into it last week and tore a large hole in its side, authorities said Tuesday.\n\nRear Adm. Nils Andreas Stensoenes, the head of Norway's navy, said several of the wires used to stabilize the KNM Helge Instad snapped Tuesday, causing the vessel to sink further into the fjord.\n\nOnly the top of the frigate with its radar and antennas remained above the waterline.\n\nThe 134-meter (442-foot) frigate began listing heavily after a Maltese-flagged oil tanker collided with it Thursday in a harbor in Sture, north of Bergen.

Authorities are investigating the cause of the accident.\n\n\"It is too early to say what kind of damages there are,\" Cmdr. Haavard Mathisen said.\n\nBuilt in Spain in 2009, the frigate was part of a NATO fleet in the Atlantic, and had recently taken part in the vast Trident Juncture NATO military drill in Norway.\n\nThe area surrounding the almost sunken frigate has been declared a military area.", "Transcript for Satellite imagery shows North Korea keeps developing secret ballistic missile sites\n\nTalks he's in the US and North Korea may be in trouble to a Washington think tank says North Korea has about twenty hidden missile production and nuclear research sites.

That may be relevant in ancient times, but in modern days, we don't do that kind of thing,\" said Mahathir, a 93-year-old political veteran whose own past treatment of dissidents at times drew opprobrium.\n\nAsked about the issue at a news conference on the sidelines of a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Singapore, Mahathir said that as a former political prisoner, Suu Kyi should understand suffering.\n\nIt is unusual for leaders in the 10-nation group to publicly criticize each other.\n\nSuu Kyi became an icon for democracy after spending about 15 years under house arrest for opposing Myanmar's earlier military dictatorship. She and her Buddhist-majority government have been widely criticized for the way they have treated the Muslim Rohingya.\n\nIn Geneva, the U.N. human rights chief said Tuesday that Bangladesh should halt plans to repatriate over 2,200 of the Rohingya refugees to Myanmar, saying such a move would endanger their lives.\n\nMichelle Bachelet's comments are among the strongest yet from a top United Nations official about the planned repatriation this week of some Rohingya.\n\nBachelet's office said it continues to receive reports of rights violations in Rakhine state, \"which include allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests.\" It said some 130,000 people, including many Rohingya, remain internally displaced in central Rakhine.\n\nOn Monday, the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR advised against the returns, saying safety should be assessed first. But it did not call for a halt to the repatriation plans.\n\nAmnesty International announced on Monday that it has withdrawn its highest honor from Suu Kyi because of her \"shameful betrayal of the values she once stood for.\"\n\n\"Today, we are profoundly dismayed that you no longer represent a symbol of hope, courage, and the undying defense of human rights.

But Pope Benedict XVI sent him to his native Malta in 2012 as bishop after Scicluna's tough line ruffled too many feathers in the Vatican.\n\nScicluna's new appointment is symbolically significant and will also give him greater say in the day-to-day running of the congregation, even though he technically retains his post in Malta.\n\nScicluna's Valletta office said Tuesday that he'll be in Rome \"on a regular basis\" and that a deputy will take over running the archdiocese when he's away, suggesting Scicluna intends the job to be more than part-time.\n\nFrancis clearly trusts Scicluna after he asked him to conduct an in-depth investigation in Chile earlier this year that revealed Francis' gross misunderstanding of an abuse and cover-up scandal there.\n\nScicluna's return to Rome comes as Francis and the church at large are under fire again for the way the Vatican and religious superiors around the globe turned a blind eye to priests who raped and molested children.\n\nThe crisis is particularly acute in the U.S., where prosecutors in more than a dozen states have announced investigations into abuse and cover-up following the revelations of the Pennsylvania grand jury report.\n\nIn addition, U.S. bishops are reeling from allegations that one of their own, ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, preyed on seminarians and at least two minors, and that his misconduct with adults was an open secret in the U.S. and Vatican.\n\nFrancis' record on abuse has long been uneven, and his papacy has been rocked by claims by a Vatican archbishop that he rehabilitated McCarrick in 2013 from sanctions imposed by Benedict.\n\nFrancis' credibility took another hit this week when the Vatican blocked U.S. bishops from voting on a new code of conduct and a commission involving lay experts to review complaints against brother bishops.\n\nUnder church law, only the pope can investigate and discipline bishops.\n\nThe head of the U.S. conference, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, admitted the Vatican only received the text after it was finalized Oct. 30, and said Rome had flagged legal problems with it.", "Transcript for Amazon to announce new headquarters in New York City, Virginia\n\nNot song down Amazon's long anticipated HQ two will be opening.

The Facebook page Muaythai Krobwongjorn, which covers the sport, said he died from a brain hemorrhage. Protective gear is normally not worn in the sport, and video circulated on social media said to be of the fight shows Anucha not wearing any.\n\nChild boxing is widespread in Thailand, especially in rural areas, where it offers a way for children to help provide for their families and a path to lift them out of poverty, according to its advocates. Opponents say the sport is dangerous, citing studies such as one published last month by Thailand's Mahidol University saying that allowing children under 15 to box could result in various types of brain damage.\n\nThai lawmakers are considering legislation proposed last month banning children under 12 from competitive boxing. The legislation has been forwarded to the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, which has already drafted a revised version, said Gen. Aduldej Intapong, a member of the National Legislative Assembly.\n\nKickboxing is one of the most popular sports in Thailand and its boosters oppose regulating it.\n\n\"This would have a major impact on the industry,\" Sukrit Parekrithawet, a lawyer who represents several boxing training camps, said of the proposed legislation. \"Those who drafted the law do not know anything about the sport of Thai boxing, and this would make Muay Thai become extinct.\"\n\n\"If you don't allow younger players to learn their way up, how can they be strong and experienced enough to fight?\" he said. \"We call it 'boxing bones.' You need to have boxing bones built from a very young age.\"\n\nSukrit said the death of the 13-year-old, who fought under the name Petchmongkol S. Wilaitong, was a one-off incident and the result of a poorly organized event.\n\n\"This has never happened before and it's unprecedented,\" he said. \"There are several factors involved which have nothing to do with age. The referee wasn't quick enough to stop the fight and the venue didn't have a doctor on standby, which shouldn't happen.\"\n\nPublic television station ThaiPBS reported that Anucha had fought more than 170 matches since he began boxing at the age of 8, and was currently fighting in the under 41 kilogram (under 90 pound) weight division. It said he was raised by his uncle, who is a boxing trainer, after his parents separated.\n\nThe uncle, Damrong Tasako, told Thai PBS that Anucha's death was an accident but he would like to see regulations for children under 15 to wear protective gear to soften blows to the head and body.", "At this year's Baghdad International Fair, Iranian businessmen displayed thick, colorful Persian rugs to impressed onlookers while others showcased the latest in Iranian manufacturing in power generators and industrial tools.\n\nFor Iranian companies, the annual Baghdad International Fair is a major event, as exporters in carpets, foodstuffs and heavy equipment look to score sales in Iraq's import-dependent economy.\n\nBut this year's edition, running this week, is an even bigger deal than usual: Iran, already feeling the bite of newly re-imposed unilateral U.S. sanctions, is turning to its neighbor to soak up its exports in agriculture, manufacturing and energy.\n\nAmbassador Iraj Masjedi promised Iran would grow its already flourishing trade with Iraq. The sanctions, he said, \"will not affect the relations between the two countries.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 nuclear deal that Iran struck with world powers in May. United Nations monitors say Iran still abides by the deal, in which it agreed to limit its uranium enrichment in return for the lifting of international sanctions.\n\nSince then, Trump announced what he billed the \"toughest ever\" sanctions regime against Iran and the country has seen its oil exports plunge and its currency lose more than half its value. The full brunt of the measures came into effect Nov. 5 when the U.S. re-imposed oil and banking sanctions.\n\nHowever, other major economies including Europe, Russia and China have refused to take parallel measures, and Iran can still do business with the outside world.\n\nIraq is Iran's second largest export market. Since 2003, when the U.S. invasion plunged the country into civil war, Iraq has depended on Iran for everything from food to machinery, to electricity and natural gas.\n\nMasjedi boasted that trade between the two countries was on track to reach $8.5 billion this year and said Iran's outlook is to reach $22 billion annually -- more than triple its $7 billion in volume in 2017. He did not give specifics.\n\nNon-American companies are free to do business with Iran, so long as they do not also do business with the U.S., or through U.S. financial institutions.\n\n\"We will not tie ourselves to the dollar,\" said Masjedi.\n\nMore than 60 Iranian companies are represented at the Baghdad fair, which runs until Nov. 19.\n\nMir Zad, director of Hisam, which sells generators and other electrical equipment, said he was aiming to secure deals worth around $1 million at the fair. He wasn't concerned about the new restrictions on the dollar; deals could be made in Iraqi dinar, he said.\n\nStill, a substantial portion of trade between the two nations is done in energy and cannot easily be structured outside the new sanctions regime.\n\nIt puts Iraq in a delicate position as a partner of both Washington and Tehran.\n\nWith its electricity sector in tatters, Iraq depends on Iranian gas and power generation to power its economy. A temporary electricity reduction last summer fueled unrest in Iraq's southern provinces.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Baghdad last Thursday announced it was granting Iraq a 45-day waiver to allow it to continue to purchase gas and electricity in Iraq.\n\nIt said the exception would give Iraq time to \"take steps toward energy independence.\"\n\nBut it could take a year or longer to secure enough new power to make up for lost imports, said economist Bassim Jameel Antwan.\n\nIn the meantime, Iraq may have little choice but to continue to import from Iran. And Iran's deep entanglement in Iraq's political and military affairs further complicates the picture.\n\nIran has the ear of several of Iraq's top politicians and trains, finances and advises some of the largest militias in the country. While it is precisely this sort of influence the U.S. is aiming to curb, Iran can still play the role of spoiler in Iraqi politics.\n\n\"You plan for one thing, and the result might be something else,\" said Antwan.\n\nSince May, Iran's currency the rial has sank in the black market from 60,000 to the dollar to 148,000 to the dollar. Oil exports fell from 2.5 million barrels per day in May to 1.85 billion in October and are expected to tumble some more.\n\n----\n\nAssociated Press writer Amir Vahdat contributed from Tehran.", "Interested in Amazon? Add Amazon as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Amazon news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nAmazon has set its sights on two of the nation's largest and most powerful metro areas, announcing Tuesday it had chosen a buzzy New York neighborhood and a suburb of Washington for its new East Coast headquarters.\n\nThe online shopping giant ended its 14-month-long competition for second headquarters by selecting Long Island City, Queens, and Arlington, Virginia , as the joint winners. Both are waterfront communities away from overcrowded business districts, giving Amazon space to grow.\n\nAmazon could have picked a city looking to be revitalized, like Newark, New Jersey. Instead, it decided to be in two of the nation's centers of power. The reason Amazon gave: they are best suited to attract the high-skilled workers the company wants. The two sites will each get 25,000 jobs that Amazon said will pay an average of $150,000 a year.\n\nThe company will receive more than $2 billion in tax credits and other incentives. New York is forking over more than $1.5 billion, while Virginia and Arlington are offering about a third of that \u2014 $573 million. The hope is that Amazon will attract other companies and ultimately boost the local economies. But while many see it as an opportunity, not everyone is sold on the idea.\n\n\"Offering massive corporate welfare from scarce public resources to one of the wealthiest corporations in the world at a time of great need in our state is just wrong,\" said New York State Sen. Michael Gianaris and New York City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, Democrats who represent the Long Island City area, in a joint statement.\n\nAmazon, which started as an online bookstore two decades ago, has grown to a behemoth that had nearly $180 billion in revenue last year. It now owns well-known brands, including grocer Whole Foods and online shoe-seller Zappos. It also makes movies and TV shows, runs an advertising business and offers cloud computing services to corporations and government agencies.\n\nThe company has more than 610,000 employees worldwide, making it the second largest U.S.-based, publicly-traded employer behind Walmart.\n\nBut it was the prospect of 50,000 jobs that led 238 communities across North America to pitch Amazon on why they should be home to the next headquarters.\n\nNew York is the nation's financial and media powerhouse and has been working to attract technology companies. Google already has more than 7,000 workers in the city and, according to media reports, is looking to add 12,000 more in coming years.\n\nArlington is directly across the Potomac River from Washington. Large government contractors have offices and lobbying operations there. However, many of its 1980s-era office buildings have vacancies after thousands of federal employees moved elsewhere. Being near the nation's capital could help Amazon with lobbying efforts as the company faces rising scrutiny from politicians.\n\nAmazon said it will spend $5 billion between both locations on construction and other projects.\n\nThe new outposts won't appear overnight. Amazon said hiring at the two headquarters will start next year, but it could take a decade or more to build out its offices.\n\nIts New York location will be in a neighborhood of Queens that sits directly across from midtown Manhattan. Once a bustling factory and freight-moving area, many of Long Island City's plants and warehouses closed as manufacturing left New York. The empty warehouses drew artists looking for affordable rents and businesses followed. Today, the neighborhood is made up of expensive, high-rise condos, with many more under construction.\n\nAmazon's Virginia offices will be in a part of Arlington that local politicians and Amazon are calling National Landing, an area around Reagan National Airport that encompasses Crystal City and Potomac Yard. Large parts are made up of vacant '70s and '80s-era office buildings. Among other challenges, Crystal City has fought to overcome a reputation for outdated architecture.\n\nVirginia state Sen. Adam Ebbin, a Democrat who represents the area where Amazon's new headquarters will be located, said that affordable housing may become an issue, but the announcement is a welcome development that will help increase the area's tax base to help ease overcrowding in schools and address other pressing needs.\n\n\"I would say it's a double-edged sword,\" said Margo Williams, who lives in nearby Alexandria, Virginia. She said more workers in the area would increase tax revenues and bring better services for the community, but she worries traffic could get worse and the Metro more crowded.\n\nAmazon said it will refer to the new locations as headquarters, even though with 25,000 jobs each, they would have fewer workers than its Seattle hometown , which houses more than 45,000 employees.\n\nSeattle will remain one of Amazon's three headquarters, and the company said that senior executives will also be based in the two new locations. It plans to hold company-wide events at the new locations, including shareholder meetings.\n\nThere were early signs that Amazon had its sights set on New York and northern Virginia. Among its 20 finalists, the company had selected two locations in the New York metro area and three in the D.C. area. Plus, CEO and founder Jeff Bezos has a home in Washington D.C., and he personally owns The Washington Post newspaper.\n\nWhile it didn't win the main prize, Nashville, Tennessee, won't go empty handed. Amazon said the finalist city will be home to a new Amazon office with 5,000 jobs, focused on customer delivery and supply chain. Those jobs will also be paid an average of $150,000 a year, Amazon said.\n\n\"You know, this is a huge win,\" said Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam. \"When we got this news, I think all of us were really, really excited about it.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAlan Suderman in Richmond, Virginia, Matthew Barakat in Arlington County, Virginia, Jonathan Mattise in Nashville, Tennessee, and Karen Matthews in New York contributed to this report.", "Transcript for Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram suffer temporary outage\n\nToday's tech Mike's an outage on FaceBook the social network says a routine tests knocked out the site Monday afternoon the outage also affected what's apt and is to Graham.

Palm Beach County said it won't finish its recount by the Thursday deadline. In oft-criticized Broward County, additional sheriff's deputies were sent to guard ballots and voting machines, a compromise aimed at alleviating concerns. Those counties are both Democratic strongholds.\n\nStill, the state elections department and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which are run by Republican appointees, have said they have seen no evidence of voter fraud. A Broward County judge challenged anyone who has evidence of fraud to file a report.\n\nMeanwhile, a flurry of legal action continued. Nelson and a Democratic campaign committee filed two more lawsuits on Tuesday, including one that asks a federal judge to set aside looming deadlines for a machine recount as well as a hand recount, if it is ordered.\n\nPresidents have historically sought to rise above the heated partisan drama surrounding election irregularities. Former President Barack Obama wasn't so publicly involved when a recount and legal process in the 2008 election delayed a Democrat taking a Minnesota Senate seat until July 2009. Former President Bill Clinton struck a lower tone during the 2000 presidential recount, which also centered on Florida.\n\nBut this year, the Florida recount was personal for Trump. He aggressively campaigned in the state in the waning days of the election and put his finger on the scales of the Republican gubernatorial primary this summer by endorsing former Rep. Ron DeSantis. After Election Day, Trump's aides pointed to the GOP's seeming success in the state as a validation that the president's path to re-election remained clear \u2014 a narrative that has grown hazier as the outcomes have become less certain.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Mercedes Schlapp said Tuesday the president \"obviously has his opinion\" on the recount.\n\n\"It's been incredibly frustrating to watch,\" she said.\n\nU.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump is attempting to bully Florida election officials out of doing their jobs. Schumer and Nelson, both Democrats, spoke with reporters Tuesday in Washington.\n\n\"It's just plain wrong. It's un-American.\" Schumer said. \"If he really wants an honest and fair election, President Trump will stop bullying, harassing and lying about the vote in Florida, and let the election proceed without the heavy hand of the president tipping the scale of justice.\"\n\nSchumer said election officials should have all the time they need to count every vote, rather than Sunday's deadline. Nelson and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee filed two lawsuits aimed at that goal. One lawsuit questions rules used by the state for hand recounts, while a second asks a federal judge to give counties more time to complete both a machine and a hand recount. Right now counties are doing a machine recount.\n\nMarc Elias, a campaign attorney for Nelson, contended there was no legal need for the existing deadlines since the Senate winner would not be sworn in until January.\n\nStill, there's not much choice but for Florida to go through the process. State law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. In the Senate race, Republican Rick Scott's lead over Nelson was 0.14 percentage points. In the governor's contest, unofficial results showed Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis ahead of Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by 0.41 percentage points.\n\nOnce the recount is complete, if the differences in any of the races are 0.25 percentage points or less, a hand recount will be ordered, meaning it could take even longer to complete the review of the Senate race if the difference remains narrow.\n\nThe recount process has drawn a sharp focus on several county election officials, especially Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes.\n\nSnipes has drawn criticism from Trump and other high-profile Republicans as her county's election returns showed a narrowing lead for Scott during the ballot-counting in the days after Election Day, and even former Gov. Jeb Bush \u2014 who appointed her in 2003 \u2014 said she should be removed. Asked about those criticisms Tuesday, she hinted that she may not run for re-election in 2020.\n\n\"It is time to move on,\" she said, later adding, \"I'll check with my family and they'll tell me what I'm doing.\"\n\nSpeaking to about 200 supporters in Orlando church Tuesday night, Gillum said claims without evidence by Trump, Scott and Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio that electoral fraud was taking place were sowing seeds that could undermine confidence in the democratic process.\n\n\"Disenfranchisement shows up with the president of the United States, the sitting governor of the state of Florida, the junior senator of the United States from the state of Florida when they take to Twitter, and Facebook and ... accuse the supervisor of elections, or an entire county for that matter, of fraud, of stuffing the ballot box, of doing everything they could do manipulate the outcome of the election without a shred of evidence. That is called disenfranchisement,\" Gillum said.\n\nMeanwhile, in Palm Beach, Elections Supervisor Susan Bucher said the county's 11-year-old tallying machines aren't fast enough to complete the recount by Thursday. The county is doing the Senate race first and will then do the governor's race. If the deadline is not met in a race, the results it reported Saturday will stand.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Tamara Lush in St. Petersburg, Florida; Gary Fineout and Brendan Farrington in Tallahassee, Florida; Mike Schneider in Orlando; and Alan Fram, Darlene Superville and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor AP's complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics .", "An Egyptian court has sentenced a policeman to three years in prison and another to six months over the killing of a detainee in custody, relatively light sentences that prompted a backlash on social media.\n\nThe Cairo Criminal Court convicted the two of beating Mohamed Abdel-Hakim to death in a police station in Cairo's Mokattam neighborhood in January.

But May faces pressure from pro-Brexit Cabinet members not to agree to an arrangement that binds Britain to EU trade rules indefinitely.\n\nMay also faces growing opposition from pro-EU lawmakers, who say her proposed Brexit deal is worse than the status quo and the British public should get a new vote on whether to leave or to stay.\n\nIf there is no agreement soon, U.K. businesses will have to start implementing contingency plans for a \"no-deal\" Brexit \u2014 steps that could include cutting jobs, stockpiling goods and relocating production and services outside Britain.\n\nEven with such measures in place, the British government says leaving the EU without a deal could cause major economic disruption, with gridlock at ports and disruption to supplies of foods, goods and medicines.\n\nOn Tuesday, the European Commission published a sheaf of notices outlining changes in a host of areas in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

That total isn't even enough to fill two-thirds of the University of Georgia's iconic Sanford Stadium, hence Peach State Democrats' frustration.\n\nLess important than the margin between the two candidates however, is another, even smaller number: 20,710 -- the number of votes that need to be distributed to a candidate other than Kemp at this point forward to knock his percentage of the vote down to 50 percent and force a runoff.\n\nAbrams fileda lawsuit Sunday seeking to prolong the process and include ballots with minor mistakes in the hope of overcoming the diminutive difference, but Georgia state law gives its 159 counties only until Tuesday to certify their results. Half have done so already, including a number of Democratic strongholds south of Atlanta.\n\nAs for outstanding votes, last week the secretary of state's office unofficially reported a total 21,190 provisional ballots, cast by voters whose eligibility was in question on Election Day. If just 3 percent of those provisional votes were cast for Kemp, a runoff would be mathematically impossible.\n\nThe Abrams campaign claims the number of provisional ballots is closer to 26,000. But even then, for a runoff, nearly 80 percent of those votes would need to have been cast for a candidate other than Kemp, which is a significant uptick from the provisional ballot count as of Monday, in which the non-Kemp votes tally 71.5 percent.\n\nReuters/AP\n\nTHE PLAYLIST\n\nABC News' \"Start Here\" Podcast.

Please check back tomorrow for the latest.", "The kilogram is getting an update.\n\nNo, your bathroom scales won't suddenly become kinder and a kilo of fruit will still weigh a kilo. But the way scientists define the exact mass of a kilogram is about to change.\n\nUntil now, its mass has been defined by the granddaddy of all kilos: a golf ball-sized metal cylinder locked in a vault in France. For more than a century, it has been the one true kilogram upon which all others were based.\n\nNo longer.\n\nGathering in Versailles, west of Paris, governments are expected on Friday to approve plans to instead use a scientific formulation to define the exact mass of a kilo. The change is expected to have practical applications in industries and sciences that require ultra-precise measurements of mass.\n\nAnd it will mean redundancy for the so-called Grand K, the kilo that has towered above them all since 1889.\n\nMade of a corrosion-resistant alloy of 90 percent platinum and 10 percent iridium , the international prototype kilo has rarely seen the light of day. Yet its role has been crucial, as the foundation for the globally accepted system for measuring mass upon which things like international trade depend.\n\nThree different keys, kept in separate locations, are required to unlock the vault where the Grand K and six official copies \u2014 collectively known as \"the heir and the spares\" \u2014 are entombed together under glass bell-jars at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, in Sevres on the western outskirts of Paris.\n\nFounded by 17 nations in 1875 and known by its French initials, the BIPM is the guardian of the seven main units humanity uses to measure its world : the meter for length, the kilogram for mass, the second for time, the ampere for electric current, the kelvin for temperature, the mole for the amount of a substance and the candela for luminous intensity.\n\nOf the seven, the kilo is the last still based on a physical artefact, the Grand K. The meter, for example, used to be a meter-long metal bar but is now defined as the length that light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458th of a second.\n\n\"This, if you like, is a moment of celebration because it's like the last standard remaining from 1875 that will finally be replaced by new innovation,\" Martin Milton, the BIPM director, said in an Associated Press interview. \"Everything else has been recycled and replaced and improved. This is the last improvement that dates back to the original conception in 1875. So that's a tribute to what was done in 1875, that it's lasted this long.\"\n\nOnly exceedingly rarely, and exceedingly carefully, have the BIPM's master kilos been gingerly taken out so that other kilos sent back to Sevres from around the world could be compared against them, to be sure they were still properly calibrated, give or take the mass of a dust particle or two.\n\nAlthough many Americans commonly think of weight in pounds and ounces, the United States is officially a kilo country, too: It was one of the original 17 founders of the BIPM in 1875. The United States' primary kilo is called K20 and was assigned to the country in 1889 by the BIPM, along with another, K4. One kilo is equivalent to 2.2 pounds.\n\nThe U.S. also has six other platinum-iridium kilos: K79, 85, 92, 102, 104 and 105. They are all looked after by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a branch of the U.S. Commerce Department.\n\nTo verify their mass, K20 and other kilos from around three dozen other countries were measured in Sevres against the BIPM's master kilos in a painstaking calibration exercise from 1988 to 1992. K20 was most recently then measured again at the BIPM in 2014.\n\nEven as humans argued, fought and slaughtered each other by the tens of millions in the 20th century, they shared the kilo. The kilo allocated to China in 1983, as it started to embrace market reforms that subsequently turned it into an economic behemoth, was the first manufactured with ultra-high precision diamond machining. Allocated to Japan in 1894, K39 was later ceded to South Korea in 1958.\n\nThe kilo is \"a tribute to man's ability to collaborate,\" Milton says. \"It's been called a great work of peace, actually, because it's one of the areas where all of the states of the world come together with absolutely the same objective.\"\n\nThe metal kilo is being replaced by a definition based on Planck's constant, which is part of one of the most celebrated equations in physics but also devilishly difficult to explain . Suffice to say that the update should, in time, spare nations the need to occasionally send their kilos back to Sevres for calibration against the Grand K. Scientists instead should be able to accurately calculate an exact kilo, without having to measure one precious lump of metal against another.\n\nMilton says the change will have applications in computing, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, the study of climate change and other sciences where precise measurements are required.\n\n\"The system will be intrinsically correct by reference to the laws of science, the laws of nature,\" he said. \"We won't have to depend on just assuming that one particular object never changes.\"", "Angry Ukrainians took to the streets and blocked roads Tuesday as hundreds of thousands remain without heating at a time when temperatures are plunging because of a dispute between the national gas company and regional utility providers.\n\nThe crisis, which affects mostly Ukraine's center, south and southeast, came after national gas company Naftagaz raised gas prices that some struggling municipalities said were impossibly high for them to pay. Naftagaz has said it will resume supply to utilities companies and powers stations only after they clear the debts or pay for supplies in advance.\n\nResidents in Kryvy Rih, a city of 600,000 in Ukraine's southeast, on Monday set tires on fire and seized the building of the local gas company demanding that the heating be turned on. Temperatures in the area were below zero overnight on Tuesday.\n\nAbout a hundred residents were protesting outside the building on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"We will take control of the boiler rooms and turn on the heating if the government doesn't care about us,\" protester Andriy Balygo told The Associated Press by phone.\n\nNeither Naftagaz nor the Ukrainian government was available for comment on Tuesday.\n\nIn the town of Smila, in central Ukraine, residents on Tuesday blocked roads leading into town to demand authorities provide heating. Smila's mayor said in comments carried by Ukrainian media that the city may be forced to announce a state of emergency if the dispute is not resolved.\n\nIn Kherson in the country's south, 30 schools and kindergartens still have no access to central heating, according to the city council.\n\nOpposition lawmaker Oleh Lyashko said last week that at least six towns with a combined population over 1 million remain without heating.\n\nUkraine is struggling with a flagging economy and a separatist conflict in the east which is weighing down on the nation's finances. One of the conditions for the International Monetary Fund to continue providing Ukraine with loans was to increase gas prices by 23 percent starting Nov. 1. Bills for hot water and heating are expected to increase by another 15 percent on Dec. 1.\n\nThe Ukrainian government stopped buying gas from Russia following the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, citing unreasonably high prices. As a result Ukraine started to buy gas from European companies, some of which resell the gas they buy from Russia.\n\nUkraine is facing a presidential election next year, and rivals of incumbent President Petro Poroshenko have been blaming the heating crisis on his administration.\n\n\"The breakdown in the heating season shows how chaotic and unprofessional the country's leadership is,\" opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko said during a campaign trip on Tuesday.", "The U.N. envoy for Libya said Tuesday he was encouraged by support from Libyan factions and the international community for a national conference planned for early 2019 to chart a path to greater stability and elections in the lawless country.\n\nGhassan Salame praised the \"louder sound of unity\" among key regional players and \"a much higher level of conviviality\" between Libyan rivals that he sensed during a two-day meeting in Sicily.\n\n\"So I do consider this conference as a success and as an important milestone in our common struggle to bring back peace, security and prosperity to the Libyan people,\" Salame told a press conference.\n\nItaly, the former colonial ruler in oil-rich Libya, had hosted the meeting in hopes of helping Libya crack down on Islamic militants and human trafficking while making progress on a U.N. action plan for improving security, economic and political problems in the country.\n\nThe summit was marked by the abrupt pullout of Turkey, which objected to having been excluded from a mini-summit Premier Giuseppe Conte hosted on the sidelines early Tuesday.\n\nThe mini-summit involved key African, European and regional players with the Tripoli-based U.N.-backed prime minister, Fayez Serraj, and rival Gen. Khalifa Hifter, commander of the self-styled Libyan National Army that is based in Libya's east.\n\n\"The informal meeting, held this (morning) with a number of players and having them presented as the prominent protagonists of the Mediterranean, is a very misleading and damaging approach which we vehemently oppose,\" Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay told reporters.\n\n\"Turkey is leaving the meeting with deep disappointment,\" he said.\n\nConte said he was personally sorry for the pullout but said such reactions were to be expected given the sensibilities in the region.\n\nExpectations going into the meeting were limited, with Hiftar's camp making clear that he wasn't participating in the conference itself but rather meeting with leaders of neighboring countries on the sidelines. Neither Hiftar nor el-Sissi nor Oktay posed for the final conference group photo.\n\nSalame, however, said he was heartened by both Hiftar and Serraj's commitment to participate in the consultative conference in Libya scheduled for the first weeks of next year. The U.N. has been soliciting input from a broad array of Libyans on the way forward, but says the time has come for a wider group to devise a clear timetable for elections.\n\n\"I feel more reassured about the convening and the possible success of this national conference,\" he said.\n\nLibya plunged into chaos after the 2011 uprising that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, and it is now governed by rival administrations in the east and west with both relying on the support of militias.\n\nIt has also become a haven for Islamic militants and armed groups, including several from neighboring countries, which survive on looting and human trafficking, particularly in the remote south of the country.\n\nItaly's anti-migrant government is keen in particular to stem the Libyan-based migrant smuggling networks that have sent hundreds of thousands of would-be refugees to Europe via Italy in recent years.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP producer Maggie Hyde in Palermo; Brian Rohan in Cairo and Nicole Winfield in Rome contributed.", "bad url", "Ernest Foss was a musician who gave lessons out of his home when he lived in San Francisco, where an amplifier that ran the length of a wall served as the family's living room couch. Carl Wiley refurbished tires for Michelin. Jesus Fernandez, known as \"Zeus,\" was described as a loving father and loyal friend.\n\nThey were among the first victims identified in the aftermath of the deadliest, most destructive wildfire in California history, an inferno blamed for at least 48 deaths, with authorities ramping up the search Tuesday for still more souls.\n\nThe flames all but obliterated the Northern California town of Paradise, population 27,000, and ravaged surrounding areas last Thursday. About 7,700 homes were destroyed.\n\nThe exact number of missing was unclear, but many friends and relatives of those living in the fire zone said they hadn't heard from loved ones. Some went to shelters looking for the missing.\n\nEfforts were underway to bring in mobile morgues, cadaver dogs, a rapid DNA analysis system for identifying victims, and an additional 150 search-and-rescue personnel on top of 13 teams already looking for remains \u2014 a grim indication that the death toll would almost surely rise.\n\nButte County Sheriff Kory Honea's office has identified four of the victims, publicly naming three.\n\nJames Wiley said sheriff's deputies informed him that his father, Carl, was among the dead, but the younger Wiley hadn't been able to leave his property in the fire area to see for himself. The elder Wiley, 77, was a tire-recapper, and the family lived in Alaska for many years before moving to Butte County decades ago.\n\nJames Wiley said his father was a stoic veteran, and the two had not spoken in six years. \"Hey, I lost him a long time ago,\" the younger man said.\n\nFoss, 63, moved to Paradise eight years ago because the high cost of living pushed him out of the San Francisco Bay Area, according to his daughter, Angela Loo. He had swollen limbs and couldn't walk. He had also been on oxygen.\n\nLoo told KTVU-TV in Oakland that her father taught music out of their home in San Francisco and turned the living room into a studio.\n\n\"I love that he shared his gift of music with me and so many others during his lifetime,\" she said. \"He would want to be remembered for being a San Franciscan through and through.\"\n\nFernandez, a 48-year-old Concow resident, also died.\n\nMyrna Pascua, whose husband was best friends with the man known as \"Zeus,\" called him a \"tireless provider, a dependable and loyal friend, a considerate neighbor, and loving father. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him.\"\n\nFive days after the blaze, over 1,000 people were at more than a half-dozen shelters set up for evacuees. At the Neighborhood Church in Chico, counselors, chaplains and nursing students from California State University, Chico, were available to help.\n\nVolunteers cooked meals, and there was a large bulletin board with information about missing people.\n\nEddie Lazarom, who fled Paradise on foot before getting a lift from a UPS truck, was among those staying at the church. He said he had yet to hear from his three grandchildren, ages 22, 24 and 28.\n\n\"I am really worried about them. They have common sense, I'm sure, but I'd hate to find out later that they burned up,\" he said.\n\nGreg Gibson came to the shelter for information about his neighbors. He doesn't know if they tried to leave or not but says the fire exploded so quickly that if they hesitated, they would have had trouble.\n\n\"It happened so fast. It would have been such an easy decision to stay, but it was the wrong choice,\" Gibson said.\n\nThe search for the dead was drawing on portable devices that can identify someone's genetic material in a couple of hours, rather than days or weeks.\n\n\"In many circumstances, without rapid DNA technology, it's just such a lengthy process,\" says Frank DePaolo, a deputy commissioner of the New York City medical examiners' office, which has been at the forefront of the science of identifying human remains since 9/11 and is exploring how it might use a rapid DNA device.\n\nStill, experts said Tuesday that authorities may first try more traditional methods of identification such as examining dental records. That's in part because victims might have undergone dental X-rays but not personal DNA profiles. Medical records of bone fractures, prosthetics or implants can also be helpful.\n\nBefore the Paradise tragedy, the deadliest single fire on record in California was a 1933 blaze in Griffith Park in Los Angeles that killed 29.\n\nAt the other end of the state, firefighters made progress against a massive blaze that has killed two people in star-studded Malibu and destroyed well over 400 structures in Southern California .\n\nThe flames roared to life again in a mountainous wilderness area Tuesday, sending up a huge plume of smoke near the community of Lake Sherwood. Still, firefighters made gains. The number of people evacuated was down by about half from the day before, to around 100,000, authorities said, and the fire was partially contained.\n\n\"We're getting the upper hand here. We're feeling better,\" Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown said California is \"pretty well maxed out\" from fighting several deadly wildfires, and he expressed gratitude for help from surrounding states and the federal government. He said the state is doing everything possible to prevent fires, but \"some things only God can do.\"\n\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke said he canceled a trip to Asia and will visit the fire zones Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nThe fire in Northern California charred at least 195 square miles (505 square kilometers), but officials said crews were able to keep it from advancing toward Oroville, a town of about 19,000 people.\n\nThe state recently completed a $1.1 billion reconstruction project at the Oroville Dam \u2014 the nation's tallest at 770 feet (235 meters) \u2014 and officials worried about damage if flames came through. Spillways at the dam crumbled during heavy rains in 2017, prompting thousands to flee for fear of a catastrophic release of water.\n\nThe cause of the fires remained under investigation, but they broke out around the time and place two utilities reported equipment trouble. Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom, who takes office in January, sidestepped questions about what action should be taken against utilities if their power lines are found to be responsible.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nContributing to this report were Associated Press writers Sudhin Thanawala, Janie Har, Jocelyn Gecker and Olga R.

Votes will not this week.\"\n\nThe Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, the country's oldest and largest support group for survivors of clergy abuse, issued a statement Monday slamming the Vatican for \"kick[ing] the can down the road.\"\n\n\"It is clear that a real response is needed in order to prevent future abuse, deter more cover-ups, and ensure accountability for bishops who fail to protect children and vulnerable adults,\" the statement said. \"Today's action by the Vatican makes us wary that such a real response will be taken.\"\n\nIn a small demonstration held outside the conference venue on Monday evening, protesters called for DiNardo to resign and for bishops to make a firm commitment to fully cooperate with the various law enforcement investigations into clergy abuse that have been launched across the country.\n\nABC News\n\nDelaware recently became the 16th jurisdiction to launch an investigation of clerical sex abuse following the release of a Pennsylvania grand jury report detailing the cover-up of decades of abuse by hundreds of Catholic priests.\n\nProbes have already been launched by officials in Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia and the District of Columbia -- as well as the Archdiocese of Anchorage in Alaska -- with officials in several other states telling ABC News their offices were reviewing their options and considering taking similar action.\n\nThe crisis has shaken the church's global hierarchy and prompted calls from some critics for the resignation of Pope Francis, but the Vatican appears to have remained skeptical of outside scrutiny.\n\nBrendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn his address to the conference on Monday, Archbishop Christopher Pierre, the Vatican's ambassador to the United States, cited the \"effective\" measures that have already been taken and stressed that the responsibility to address the crisis rested with the bishops.\n\n\"There may be a temptation on the part of some to relinquish responsibility for reform to others than ourselves, as if we were no longer capable of reforming or trusting ourselves, as if the deposit of trust should be transferred to other institutions entirely,\" Pierre said. \"We must show that we can solve problems rather than simply delegating them to others.\"", "A long-running board room battle in Italy's legacy telecoms provider, Telecom Italia, has culminated with the ouster of CEO Amos Genish, effective immediately.\n\nTelecom Italia said in a statement Tuesday that the board will meet Sunday to name a new CEO.

Its rescue is a reality check for an industry hoping to apply the budget flying model to long-haul routes.\n\nAnd for now it means that passengers from, say, Washington will likely have to pay more than the $99 teaser rates previously offered for the nine-hour trip to the Icelandic capital, which serves as a stopover to mainland Europe.\n\n\"It simply costs more than $99 to fly between continents and Wow air has not found ways around it,\" said Kristjan Sigurjonsson, editor of local travel news site Turisti.\n\nHe says it is not clear whether Icelandair will continue offering such low fares in an attempt to compete with Norwegian Air, which is offering cheap flights at a loss to gain market share.\n\nBut for now, the numbers don't add up for budget long-haul flying.\n\nPart of the business model for low-cost flying across the Atlantic depends on getting cheaper airport slots, both by departing at odd hours and by flying to smaller cities in the United States. Wow flies to St Louis and Pittsburgh, for example. The low fares, in turn, mean planes are typically full.\n\nWow flies across the Atlantic with single-aisle, narrow-body Airbus A321 jets. Being smaller than a widebody plane makes them easier to fill, an important consideration in keeping down costs per seat. They are also cheaper than two-aisle planes. Wow's jets are relatively new, meaning they are more fuel-efficient than some competitors' fleets.\n\nHowever, those savings have been squeezed in the past couple years as oil prices have risen. The U.S. benchmark for oil has risen 50 percent from late 2016 to a peak of $75 in September this year, before easing back somewhat.\n\nFor a budget airline like Wow, where margins are already tight, that means a direct hit to earnings. On top of that, wages have been rising sharply in Iceland, where its employees are based.\n\nFounded in 2012, the airline expanded fast to 37 destinations and reported up to 60 percent annual growth in passenger numbers. Its revenue per passenger, however, has not kept up and fell by about 20 percent in 2017, according to the last earnings report.\n\nAbout 70 percent percent of Wow's passengers travel between Europe and North America. Combined with Icelandair, the airlines will carry about 3.8 percent of transatlantic passengers, according to analysts at Icelandair.\n\nExperts say that what budget airlines like Wow lack is the big source of money from transatlantic flying: business travelers. The New York-London route is the most lucrative in the world, thanks to the amount of business travelling done between the two financial hubs. British Airways takes in a reported $1 billion a year between those cities alone.\n\nBudget airlines have been trying to tap that market. Wow created a new business-class scheme and in a presentation to investors this year it predicted that would help it make a profit this quarter. Norwegian Air has also offered \"Premium class without the premium price,\" reportedly with modest success.\n\nBut it remains to be seen whether companies booking trips will agree to pick budget airlines over established carriers that are often seen as more reliable because they have bigger fleets and deeper pockets.\n\n\"The established airlines have loyalty programs that hold tight to the most lucrative clients,\" said Skarphedinn Steinarsson, former CEO of low-cost carrier IcelandExpress and the director of the Icelandic Tourist Board. \"It takes longer to win this group over than the typical bargain-hunter.\"\n\nFor now, it is the flagship carrier coming out on top.\n\nWow founder and CEO Skuli Mogensen urged his staff Monday to \"look at this as an opportunity to continue our journey now as a part of a much stronger group\".\n\nThe charismatic boss, who has in the past mocked Icelandair as \"outdated\" and used his image to represent the airline, acknowledge defeat with much understatement: \"It was not part of the original game plan.\"", "Demand for healthy, natural food is extending from humans to their pets.\n\nPetco says it will stop selling dog and cat food and treats with artificial colors, flavors and preservatives by May, both online and at its nearly 1,500 stores in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.\n\nPetco's move is the first of its kind among major pet stores.

Add George Zimmerman as an interest to stay up to date on the latest George Zimmerman news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nA Florida judge agreed to let former neighborhood watch leader George Zimmerman serve probation for a year after his attorney entered a no contest plea Tuesday to resolve a misdemeanor charge of stalking a private investigator associated with a documentary on the black teenager Zimmerman killed.\n\nSeminole County Judge Mark Herr admonished Zimmerman to understand that \"words matter.\" Under a no contest plea, a defendant doesn't admit guilt, and a conviction is withheld if the conditions of the plea are met. Zimmerman wasn't at the courthouse during the hearing.\n\n\"Please counsel him,\" the judge told his attorney, Zahra Umansky. \"Words do matter.\"\n\nThe private investigator, Dennis Warren, said after the hearing that Zimmerman didn't get the sentence he deserved but believed \"we got the best we could.\" He said he had hoped the case would have been handled as a felony rather than a misdemeanor.\n\nThe private investigator said he didn't think Zimmerman could get through a year without violating his probation.\n\n\"He can't stay away from trouble. He's toxic,\" Warren said.\n\nZimmerman was accused of sending threatening messages to Warren. The private investigator was hired by a documentary filmmaker who was working on a series on Trayvon Martin, the black teen who was fatally shot by Zimmerman in 2012. Zimmerman, who identifies as Hispanic, was acquitted of all charges in the case, which raised questions about race and Florida's \"stand your ground\" self-defense law. That law allows people to use force without retreating if they feel threatened. Critics say the law allows black men to be victimized by gun violence\n\nThe documentary was produced by rapper Jay-Z.\n\nReading a victim impact statement in court, Warren said Zimmerman made scores of harassing emails and telephone calls, threatening the private investigator and his family starting last December. The threats included details about his life that few people knew, such as where he was traveling and on what airline, said Warren, who got extra security for his house.\n\n\"The threats were for me to immediately stop what I was doing or he was going to harm me,\" said Warren, who added he believed Zimmerman still had \"a propensity for violence.\"\n\nWhen Warren started describing how he felt mistreated by Zimmerman's attorney during a deposition, the judge stopped him after Umansky objected.\n\n\"I feel your pain, Mr. Warren ...

She survived the horrific attack became the youngest person to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.\n\nYousafzai, who has been living in Britain since her attack, visited her hometown in March 2017.

Another had to restart its recount after getting about a quarter finished because someone forgot to push a button. And in oft-criticized Broward County, additional sheriff's deputies were sent to guard ballots and voting machines, even though a judge said no Republican who has publicly alleged fraud in the county's process \u2014 a list that includes President Donald Trump and Gov. Rick Scott \u2014 has filed a criminal complaint or presented evidence.\n\n\"An honest vote count is no longer possible\" in Florida, Trump declared Monday, without elaborating. He demanded that the election night results \u2014 which showed the Republicans leading based upon incomplete ballot counts \u2014 be used to determine the winner.\n\nTrump went on to allege that \"new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged\" and that \"ballots (are) massively infected.\" It was unclear what he was referring to.\n\nState law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. In the Senate race, Scott's lead over incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson was 0.14 percentage points. In the governor's contest, unofficial results showed Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis ahead of Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by 0.41 percentage points.\n\nOnce the recount is complete, if the differences in any of the races are 0.25 percentage points or less, a hand recount will be ordered. All 67 counties face a state-ordered deadline of Thursday to finish their recounts.\n\nTrump's comments came just hours before Broward Chief Circuit Judge Jack Tuter held an emergency hearing on a request by Scott's lawyers asking for additional sheriff's deputies to be sent to Election Supervisor Brenda Snipes' office to monitor ballots and voting machines. The lawyers requested that the deputies be present when the ballots and voting machines are not being used until the recount is over.\n\nScott's lawyers alleged in court documents that Snipes was engaging in \"suspect and unlawful vote counting practices\" that violate state law and that she might \"destroy evidence of any errors, accidents or unlawful conduct.\" The motion was supported by lawyers representing the state Republican Party and opposed by Snipes' office, Nelson's campaign and the state Democratic Party.\n\n\"I am urging because of the highly public nature of this case to ramp down the rhetoric,\" Tuter said.\n\n\"If someone in this lawsuit or someone in this county has evidence of voter fraud or irregularities at the supervisor's office, they should report it to their local law enforcement officer,\" Tuter said. \"If the lawyers are aware of it, they should swear out an affidavit, but everything the lawyers are saying out there in front of the elections office is being beamed all over the country. We need to be careful of what we say. Words mean things these days.\"\n\nAfter Tuter told all sides to meet to discuss a compromise, they agreed to add three deputies to the elections office.\n\nMeanwhile, Elections Supervisor Mark Andersen in heavily Republican Bay County told the Miami Herald on Monday that he allowed about 150 people to cast ballots by email, which is illegal under state law. The county was devastated by a Category 4 hurricane in October, and Scott ordered some special provisions for early voting there.\n\nManatee County, south of Tampa Bay, had to restart its recount Monday because a needed button on the machine wasn't pushed. The error was caught after about a quarter of the county's nearly 165,000 votes had been recounted, said Michael Bennett, the county's Republican elections supervisor.

Just this week, a judge cleared Rabuka of an electoral disclosure violation in a case many viewed as being politically motivated.\n\nFiji has not allowed the political tensions to affect its vital tourism industry, which promotes the Pacific nation's pristine, sunny beaches and friendly, welcoming people.\n\nGiven the history of coups, political stability has been a big issue leading up to the election, as have racial tensions and economic issues.\n\n\"Bainimarama does look set to secure his second victory at the polls and has already led the country for 13 years through a period of relative stability,\" said Jonathan Pryke, the director of the Pacific Islands Program at the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank.\n\nMany people in the nation of 920,000 seem appreciative of the economic gains they've made under Bainimarama.\n\n\"There are no school fees. Before, I paid a couple hundred for school fees,\" said Mere Rigamoto, a 42-year-old mother of three boys. \"Bainimarama's government is not bad. He's OK.\"\n\nBut Bainimarama has a troubled political history that has contributed to the coup culture. There are rumors he could stage another coup should he lose the election.\n\n\"We're bound to have another coup if he doesn't win,\" said 30-year-old Robert Lum On, a recent university graduate.\n\nFiji became independent from the U.K. in 1970. In 1987, Rabuka staged two racially charged coups to return the country to the hands of indigenous Fijians, called \"iTaukei,\" and away from Fijians of Indian descent, or Indo-Fijians.\n\niTaukei make up about 57 percent of the country's population, while Indo-Fijians make up 38 percent.\n\nIndo-Fijians have been a major ethnic group in Fiji since colonial times, when the British brought them in to work the sugar cane plantations. Many Indo-Fijians favor Bainimarama, whose new constitution in 2013 removed race quotas from parliament.\n\n\"Bainimarama's key success has been to establish the name 'Fijian' for all citizens of Fiji,\" said Richard Herr, a professor at Fiji National University who is based in Australia. \"His legislation has made campaigning on race, or even having a racially based party, illegal.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, Bainimarama accused Rabuka of stoking the flames of racism that continue to divide the nation. But some indigenous Fijians believe Rabuka will help restore their prestige, and favor his promise to bring back the nation's Great Council of Chiefs, which Bainimarama disbanded.\n\nCritics deride Bainimarama as authoritarian, but since forcing himself into power he has refashioned his image into that of a stable, legitimate leader.\n\nHis appeal was bolstered when he assumed the U.N. COP23 presidency in November 2017. In that role, which he holds until December, he shaped Fiji into a pioneer on climate change issues.\n\nWith COP23 as a platform, Fiji inserted small island developing states into the international conversation on climate change. The islands are on the front lines of global warming, rising sea levels, and ocean acidification.\n\nAfter the 2006 coup, Australia and New Zealand imposed sanctions on Fiji, and Bainimarama reoriented regional alliances toward China. His critics accuse him of selling out the country to the Chinese.\n\nThe Lowy Institute says Fiji received about $360 million in aid from China between 2006 and 2016, putting it behind only Papua New Guinea in the Pacific region. China Exim Bank holds 39 percent of Fiji's externally held public debt, according to The Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nFiji's relations have since normalized with Australia and New Zealand, but the period of sanctions enabled China to step up its regional influence.\n\nFiji has one of the healthiest economies of the Pacific Islands, and GDP is predicted to grow above 3 percent annually through 2020. Tourism is the bedrock of the economy, accounting for more than 40 percent of GDP.\n\nBainimarama's government takes credit for increasing social services, including free primary and secondary education, free bus fares for seniors, and aid in the aftermath of cyclones.\n\nBut widespread poverty persists. Bainimarama's opponents have vowed to raise the minimum wage, which remains only about $1.25 per hour.\n\nAlthough the coup culture can't be erased, many argue that Fiji has stabilized under Bainimarama.\n\n\"His prime ministership to date has been marked with a steady movement back towards democracy,\" said Pryke, of the Lowy Institute.\n\n\"While there is still more work to do \u2014 domestic media is engaged in significant self-censorship and opposition parties remain harassed \u2014 the prime minister has delivered on political stability that has enabled economic growth and development progress to be prioritized.\"\n\nPolls close at 6 p.m. Wednesday (0500 GMT). As well as Bainimarama's FijiFirst party and Rabuka's Social Democratic Liberal Party (Sodelpa), the National Federation Party (NFP) is also expected to be an election contender. In 2014, FijiFirst won 59 percent of votes, Sodelpa won 28 percent, and NFP won 5.5 percent.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNick Perry in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report.", "Karen Pence, the U.S. vice president's wife, announced Tuesday a $54,000 U.S. grant to a teacher at Tsukuba University in Japan for the study of art therapy, a little-known mental health profession she has championed under the Trump administration.\n\nPence was in Japan while accompanying her husband, Mike Pence, on a trip through Asia for a series of meetings, including a Southeast Asian summit in Singapore and an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Papua New Guinea.\n\nKaren Pence declined to answer questions during an interview with The Associated Press about opposition in Japan to the presence of the U.S. military and about the recent U.S. midterm elections that saw her husband's Republican Party lose control of the House of Representatives. Instead, the focus was on art therapy, which uses craft work to help people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, autism or other mental illnesses, as well as children with cancer.\n\n\"When we go all over the world and observe art therapy, it's used frequently with people who are having some kind of depression, or stress or trauma, anxiety, anger issues,\" Pence said in the interview while attending a meeting with art therapists and other guests at the U.S. ambassador's residence in Tokyo.\n\nArt therapy has also been reported as effective for people in the military dealing with suicidal thoughts, depression and nightmares. In Japan, it has also been used for hospitalized children and women experiencing domestic abuse.\n\nTuesday's grant goes to Cheryl Okubo, an art therapist, who will pilot a course at Tsukuba University, and introduce a two-year curriculum, taught by both American and Japanese art therapists, for students and faculty.\n\nJapan does not yet have a system to authorize art therapists, and people who want to study it have had to go to the United States or Great Britain. Akie Abe, the wife of the Japanese prime minister, told an audience during the meeting that she appreciated Pence's efforts to promote art therapy in Japan.\n\nSupporting the spouses of U.S. troops is another interest for Pence, who is not an art therapist. She is a watercolor artist. She met with such spouses at the ambassador's residence, and called their work as crucial as military service.\n\n\"We find it very effective with spouses and children,\" she said of the use of art therapy. \"Probably the most important is to get it for our service members who have injuries. But the other important thing is to make spouses aware of it.\"\n\nAmy Snyder, the wife of a U.S. Army soldier stationed at Camp Zama, near Tokyo, stood in line to get a special bracelet Pence hands out to spouses to show gratitude for their work.\n\n\"It was amazing, and I liked how she was talking to us,\" she said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the grant is going to a teacher at Tsukuba University, not the university itself.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nYuri Kageyama is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nOn Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en", "Interested in Russia?

In fact, when the Saudi intelligence officer listened to the recording he was so shocked that he said 'this one probably took heroin. Only someone who took heroin would do it,'\" Erdogan was reported as saying in comments published in pro-government newspaper Yeni Safak.\n\nErdogan did not elaborate on how and when the Saudi official heard the recording of the killing of the Saudi citizen.\n\nTurkey says Khashoggi, who wrote for The Washington Post columnist and often criticized the crown prince, was killed by a 15-member assassination squad sent from Riyadh. Ankara insists the orders for the killing came from the highest levels of the Saudi government, but not King Salman.\n\nTurkey has said a 15-member Saudi \"hit squad\" strangled and dismembered Khashoggi at the consulate.

Two other of his refrigerator trucks had been parked in front of his house for the last three years.\n\nEven before the crossing officially closed, his brother was briefly abducted by rebels while driving a truck through Syria, underscoring the perils they faced in trying to keep the route open.\n\nThe crossing was Lebanon's \"lung,\" Araji said, and its closure was a \"death blow\" to the economy, affecting farmers, merchants, industrialists and drivers. So he was pleased when Syrian government forces reopened the crossing and secured the route.\n\nBut for weeks he was unable to find exporters ready to give him shipping contracts. Finally, on Saturday, he sent his first truckloads to Saudi Arabia after offering an exporter an attractive price.\n\n\"People are still waiting to see what will happen,\" he said.\n\nThe land route through Syria, Jordan and Iraq is vital to Lebanon, which is squeezed between Syria, the closed border with Israel, and the sea.

After the closure, that dropped to some 300 trucks in a good month, bound only for Syria, customs officials said.\n\nAn estimated 550,000 tons of vegetables and fruits a year used to be exported through the Syria-Jordan crossing, according to Ibrahim Tarshishi, head of the Bekaa farmer's union. Since the shutdown, that flow has dropped by nearly 40 percent, to no more than 330,000 tons. Exports from Bekaa to Saudi Arabia have dropped by 60 percent, according to figures from the Bekaa chamber of commerce.\n\nAfter the crossing reopened, Syria and Jordan imposed new transit tariffs on trucks heading to the Gulf. The Syrian increase alone was five-fold, Tarshishi said. Lebanon meanwhile subsidizes transport by sea.\n\nTraders hope improved ties between Syria and Lebanon will lead to reduced tariffs, but Lebanon's political leaders are fiercely divided between supporters and opponents of President Bashar Assad, and they have been unable to form a government since elections in May.\n\nContacts among Lebanese and Syrian officials remain personal and partisan \u2014 and some complain Syria is using the tariffs to force normalization. Experts say opaque policies and decision-making have also hindered trade.\n\nCharles Zarzour, the head of the government agency for agricultural exports and imports, said the opening of the crossing has at least offered \"psychological relief\" to traders.\n\n\"God willing, when we have a government in Lebanon, it lays down a wise policy that serves the country's interest,\" including tariff reductions, he told The Associated Press.\n\nSyrian officials had no immediate comment.\n\nTarshishi has pressed for an end to the sea shipping subsidies and other government action to revive land exports, but in the caretaker government \"no one wants to take responsibility,\" he said.\n\nOn a recent afternoon at al-Masnaa, the Lebanese side of the crossing into Syria, nearly a dozen trucks loaded with bananas were bound for Damascus. Just one truck, carrying cleaning supplies, was heading to Jordan. None were bound for the Gulf.\n\nTalal Darwish, a produce exporter, is still sending his grapes, apples and pears by sea, and on a recent day, workers raced to prepare a shipment bound for Kuwait. By land would be cheaper and faster \u2014 a five-day trip as opposed to 25.\n\nHe has heard talk of efforts to reduce tariffs, but says \"we still don't know officially, so there is no rush.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Hiba Delwati in Beirut contributed to this report.", "Interested in Japan?

In Iran, the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions last week on oil exports is expected to drive up inflation there to more than 40 percent by year's end.\n\nThe findings, which came in the IMF's new regional outlook report, said the overall fiscal deficit for the Mideast's oil exporters is projected to decline from around $118 billion last year to $41 billion this year, before narrowing to $3 billion in 2019.\n\nFor Saudi Arabia, growth projections remain unchanged despite fallout from the killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last month. International outrage prompted big name executives and officials to back out from attending a major investment conference in Riyadh after the killing. IMF chief Christine Lagarde was among the high-level participants who pulled out of the summit.\n\nStill, it's too early to tell what the impact of this could be on the Saudi economy, where the price of oil remains a key determinant, said the IMF's Mideast and Central Asia director Jihad Azour.\n\n\"There are several more important issues that factor in play. The evolution of oil price. The level of export of oil. The spending in government. The pace of reforms,\" Azour told The Associated Press.\n\nThe IMF projects that Saudi Arabia's economy will see 2.2 percent growth this year and 2.4 percent next year, after shrinking 0.9 percent last year. Saudi Arabia is aiming to balance its budget by 2023.\n\nIran's economy is expected to contract by 1.5 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2019, the report said. This comes after Iran's economy saw growth of 12.5 percent in 2016 and 3.7 in 2017, after sanctions had been temporarily lifted.\n\nAzour said one of the most pressing issues facing Iran is aligning the official local currency exchange rate with black market rates.\n\nThe IMF cautions that global oil prices, while potentially buoyed in the near-term by cuts in Iranian oil supply, are expected to slide down to around $60 a barrel in the next three to four years.\n\nBenchmark Brent crude, which had been trading above $80 a barrel recently, now hovers around $70 after U.S. sanctions waivers for countries that import heavily from Iran, which accounts for 5 percent of global oil exports.\n\n\"For Saudi and other GCC countries, we believe it's not now the time to be complacent,\" Azour said, referring to other Arab oil-exporting countries in the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe IMF is urging oil-exporters in the region to curb subsidies to reduce spending, expand taxes to boost revenue and narrow the public sector wage bill by attracting foreign investment and encouraging the private sector to create more jobs.\n\nThe IMF also warns that at least 25 million new jobs need to be created in the next five years to keep unemployment rates the same across the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nAzour said a country like Egypt, where economic growth this year and last exceeded 5 percent, needs to create 700,000 to 1 million new jobs per year to keep it's unemployment rate from rising.", "When U.S. forces and their Afghan allies rode into Kabul in November 2001 they were greeted as liberators. But after 17 years of war, the Taliban have retaken half the country, security is worse than it's ever been, and many Afghans place the blame squarely on the Americans.\n\nThe United States has lost more than 2,400 soldiers in its longest war, and has spent more than $900 billion on everything from military operations to the construction of roads, bridges and power plants. Three U.S. presidents have pledged to bring peace to Afghanistan, either by adding or withdrawing troops, by engaging the Taliban or shunning them. Last year, the U.S. dropped the \"mother of all bombs\" on a cave complex.\n\nNone of it has worked. After years of frustration, Afghanistan is rife with conspiracy theories, including the idea that Americans didn't stumble into a forever war, but planned one all along.\n\nMohammed Ismail Qasimyar, a member of Afghanistan's High Peace Council, wonders how U.S. and NATO forces \u2014 which at their peak numbered 150,000 and fought alongside hundreds of thousands of Afghan troops, were unable to vanquish tens of thousands of Taliban.\n\n\"Either they did not want to or they could not do it,\" he said. He now suspects the U.S. and its ally Pakistan deliberately sowed chaos in Afghanistan to justify the lingering presence of foreign forces \u2014 now numbering around 15,000 \u2014 in order to use the country as a listening post to monitor Iran, Russia and China.\n\n\"They have made a hell, not a paradise for us,\" he said.\n\nAfghanistan is rife with such conspiracy theories. After last month's assassination of Kandahar's powerful police chief, Gen. Abdul Raziq, social media exploded with pictures and posts suggesting he was the victim of a U.S. conspiracy. Recent insider attacks, in which Afghan forces have killed their erstwhile U.S. and NATO allies, have attracted online praise.\n\n\"In 2001 the Afghan people supported the arrival of the United States and the international community wholeheartedly,\" said Hamid Karzai, who was installed as Afghanistan's first president and twice won re-election, serving until 2014.\n\n\"For a number of years things worked perfectly well,\" he said in a recent interview. \"Then we saw the United States either changed course or simply neglected the views of the Afghan people and the conditions of the Afghans.\"\n\nHe blames the lingering war on the U.S. failure to eliminate militant sanctuaries in neighboring Pakistan, the bombing of Afghan villages and homes, and the detention of Afghans in raids.\n\nOthers blame the notoriously corrupt government, which Karzai headed for more than a decade, and which is widely seen as yet another bitter fruit of the American invasion.\n\n\"All the money that has come to this country has gone to the people in power. The poor people didn't get anything,\" said Hajji Akram, a day laborer in Kabul's Old City who struggles to feed his family on around $4 a day. \"The foreigners are not making things better. They should go.\"\n\nIt's not just Afghans. The United States' own inspector general for Afghanistan's reconstruction offered a blistering critique in a speech in Ohio earlier this month.\n\nJohn Sopko pointed out that the U.S. has spent $132 billion on Afghanistan's reconstruction \u2014 more than was spent on Western Europe after World War II. Another $750 billion has been spent on U.S. military operations, and Washington has pledged $4 billion a year for Afghanistan's security forces.\n\nThe result?\n\n\"Even after 17 years of U.S. and coalition effort and financial largesse, Afghanistan remains one of the poorest, least educated, and most corrupt countries in the world,\" Sopko said. \"It is also one of the most violent.\"\n\nHamidullah Nasrat sells imported fabrics in the capital's main bazaar on the banks of the Kabul River, a fetid trickle running through a garbage-filled trench. He remembers welcoming the overthrow of the Taliban, who had shut down his photography studio because it was deemed un-Islamic.\n\n\"After the Taliban we were expecting something good, but instead, day by day, it is getting worse,\" he said. \"How is it that a superpower like the United States cannot stop the Taliban? It is a question every Afghan is asking.\"\n\nThe U.S. and NATO formally concluded their combat mission in 2014. Since then, the Taliban have carried out near-daily attacks on rural checkpoints and staged coordinated assaults on major cities. Authorities stopped publishing casualty figures earlier this year, deeming them classified. An Islamic State affiliate has meanwhile carried out massive bombings against the country's Shiite minority.\n\nAfghans who have recently served on the front lines complain of faulty equipment, inadequate supplies and reinforcements that show up late and ill-equipped, if at all.\n\nTameem Darvesh served in the Afghan army for nearly five years in the southern Helmand province. This year he went on holiday and never returned, trading his $180 monthly salary for work as a day laborer making much less. He said morale is at an all-time low, with many soldiers expressing sympathy for the Taliban.\n\nJawad Mohammadi served for more than seven years in the security forces until 2015, when he stepped on a land-mine he was tasked to clear and lost both his legs. He was just 25 years old.\n\nHe recalls how the foreign instructors told him to always check his mine detector by waving it over a piece of metal before heading out into the field. But whenever a device failed to respond, his Afghan commander would tell him to use it anyway.\n\n\"I was told that's all we have. That's what we were given, you just have to use it,\" he said.\n\nThe next time he went out with a faulty device, his foot found a bomb the detector had missed.\n\n\"I felt myself being thrown through the air.

Add Israel as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Israel news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nHamas and other militant groups said Tuesday they had accepted an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire to end two days of intense fighting with Israel that had pushed the sworn enemies to the brink of a new war.\n\nThe sudden announcement brought relief to a region that had been paralyzed by hundreds of Palestinian rocket attacks in southern Israel and scores of Israeli airstrikes on targets in the Gaza Strip. But it did not address the deeper issues that pushed Israel and Gaza's Hamas rulers toward their latest violence and left doubts about international efforts to forge a broader truce agreement.\n\nThose efforts had appeared to be making progress in recent days as Israel allowed Qatar to deliver financial aid to the cash-strapped Hamas government, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that he wanted to avert an \"unnecessary\" war in Gaza. Hamas, in turn, had scaled back its mass protests that have led to weekly bloodshed along the Israeli border.\n\nBut hours after Netanyahu spoke Sunday, an Israeli commando unit on an undercover mission was caught behind enemy lines in Gaza by Hamas militants. Their discovery set off a battle that led to the deaths of seven militants and an Israeli officer, and triggered the heaviest barrage of rocket fire since a 2014 war.\n\nThe Israeli military said that Palestinian militants fired 460 rockets and mortars into Israel in a 24-hour period, while it carried out airstrikes on 160 targets in Gaza. Seven Palestinians, including five militants, were killed, and 26 people were wounded. In Israel, a 48-year-old Palestinian laborer was killed in a rocket strike on an apartment building where he was staying. Nearly 30 people were wounded, three critically.\n\nWith air raid sirens wailing throughout southern Israel and the explosions of airstrikes thundering in Gaza, the sides had appeared to be headed to what would have been their fourth war in a decade.\n\nBut late Tuesday, Hamas and other military groups issued a joint statement saying they had accepted an Egyptian cease-fire.\n\nTerms of the deal appeared to be modest. Daoud Shehab, a spokesman for the Islamic Jihad militant group, said each side would promise quiet in exchange for quiet.\n\n\"It's a mutual commitment to the cease-fire,\" he said. \"From our side, we responded positively to the Egyptian endeavor on the condition that the occupation does the same.\"\n\nThe announcement set off celebrations in Gaza City as Hamas supporters declared victory.\n\nAt a demonstration staged in the rubble of Hamas' TV station, demolished by an Israeli airstrike, crowds chanted the name of Hamas' military wing. Shops reopened and cars jammed the streets. Israeli reconnaissance drones continued to buzz overhead.\n\nIsmail Radwan, a Hamas official, expressed Hamas' commitment to the cease-fire but warned that \"our hands are on the trigger\" if Israel violates the agreement.\n\nIn Israel, officials had no comment on the cease-fire claim even as dozens of protesters in the rocket-battered town of Sderot chanted \"Disgrace!\" at what they saw as the government's capitulation to militant violence. But after nightfall, both the rocket attacks and Israeli airstrikes had stopped.\n\nThe announcement came shortly after Netanyahu's Security Cabinet ended a seven-hour discussion on the rising tensions in Gaza.\n\nThe Cabinet said it had ordered the military to \"continue operations as needed.\" Israel's Channel 10 TV reported deep divisions among the participants, with several hard-line ministers reportedly opposed to another cease-fire with Hamas.\n\nHamas, an Islamic militant group that opposes Israel's existence, seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority in 2007.\n\nIsrael and Egypt immediately imposed a blockade on Gaza to contain Hamas. The blockade has ravaged Gaza's economy, and Israel refuses to lift it unless Hamas disarms, a demand the militants reject.\n\nThe standoff has produced repeated rounds of violence, including indiscriminate Gaza rocket fire at Israeli towns and cities and punishing Israeli military offensives, but Hamas remains firmly in control. Netanyahu's apparent reluctance to launch a full-scale war reflected the lack of good choices at his disposal.\n\nIsrael Ziv, a retired general who once commanded the Israeli military's Gaza division, said Netanyahu was running out of options for dealing with Hamas.\n\n\"Either we come to a settlement or there's an all-out campaign. Nothing in the middle is going to make a difference,\" he said.\n\nTuesday's cease-fire did not appear to address any of the underlying issues, including the blockade and Hamas' vast arsenal of rockets, and it was unclear whether U.N. and Egyptian efforts toward a broader deal might resume.\n\nU.N. and Egyptian mediators had been making progress in recent weeks toward informal understandings between Israel and Hamas that would ease the blockade in exchange for ratcheting down the border protests.\n\nDemonstrators each week approach the border fence, throwing firebombs, grenades and burning tires at Israeli troops. Israeli snipers have killed about 170 people, most of them unarmed. Israel says it is defending its border against attackers, but it has come under heavy international criticism for shooting unarmed people.\n\nIn recent days, Israel allowed fuel shipments to increase the power supply in Gaza, which suffers from frequent blackouts, and agreed to additional Qatari assistance to allow Hamas to pay the salaries of its thousands of unpaid workers.\n\nA diplomatic official said the cease-fire included an \"understanding\" to return to a 2014 cease-fire that promised some relief for Gaza in exchange for quiet.\n\nThe official said he expected a return to the situation before the latest burst of violence and for mediators to resume their efforts. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter with the media.\n\nPalestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour told reporters at U.N. headquarters that \"we are grateful for the Egyptians who are mediating.\"\n\nThe U.N.

Otherwise, it will affect the whole world,\" Li said.\n\n\"We hope that negotiations will be carried out on the basis of mutual respect, balance, mutual benefit and good faith, so that a solution can be found acceptable to both sides,\" he added.\n\nLi is on an official visit to Singapore to attend an annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which begins later Tuesday.", "A suburban Chicago alderman called Tuesday for prosecutors to investigate the fatal shooting of a black security guard by a white police officer outside the bar where the guard worked.\n\nAuthorities have said little about the scene that ended early Sunday with the death of 26-year-old Jemel Roberson, who was apparently wearing a hat emblazoned with \"security\" across the front when he was shot outside Manny's Blue Room in Robbins, a predominantly black community just south of Chicago.\n\nAt the time, according to witnesses and a lawsuit, Roberson was attempting to detain a suspect in a separate shooting that wounded several other people at the tavern.\n\n\"Here is a security guard who is subduing a suspect,\" but the officer \"just sees a black man with a gun and kills him,\" Alderman Keith Price said.\n\nPrice said he learned from witnesses that there are security cameras inside and outside the bar. He urged the Cook County State's Attorney's Office to launch an investigation.\n\nThe Illinois State Police declined to comment on their investigation. A spokeswoman for the sheriff's department, which is also investigating, said she did not know if there were security cameras at the bar.\n\nAnother security guard at the tavern said the officer jumped onto the bar and waved an assault rifle before running outside and fatally shooting the guard, an attorney said Tuesday.\n\nGregory E. Kulis, who on Monday filed a civil rights lawsuit against the officer and the community where he works, said the surviving guard told him that the officer pointed a gun at him until he screamed at him that he was a security guard.\n\n\"That's when he jumped off the bar, waving the gun, and ran outside the door,\" said Kulis, who declined to identify the other security guard. The name of the officer, who is from the community of Midlothian, has not been released either.\n\nIn a statement, Midlothian Police Chief Daniel Delaney said only that the officer shot \"a subject with a gun.\" The officer has been placed on administrative leave, which is standard in such shootings until the investigation is complete, the chief said.\n\nProtesters gathered Tuesday outside the Midlothian Police Department, some carrying portraits of Roberson. A memorial of candles took shape nearby.\n\nThough shootings of security guards and off-duty police officers by law enforcement are fairly rare, they have happened.\n\nIn 2009, an off-duty black New York City police officer wearing street clothes and holding his service weapon, was shot and killed by police as he chased a man who had broken into his car.\n\nIn that same year, undercover officers in Brooklyn responding to a report of a bar fight shot and killed a 43-year-old security guard who, police said, pointed a gun at them.\n\nA year earlier, in White Plains, New York, a black off-duty Mount Vernon officer who was holding an assault suspect at gunpoint was fatally shot by a Westchester County officer.\n\nA 73-year-old night watchman at a recycling center was fatally shot by officers in 2012 in Florida after they spotted him carrying a gun when they arrived in response to a call of an intruder. Police later said the man was not wearing anything that identified him as a security guard.\n\nAnd in 2000, an off-duty black police sergeant in Rhode Island was shot and killed by two uniformed colleagues as he tried to break up a fight in a parking lot.\n\nKulis would not say if he thinks race played a role in Chicago-area shooting, but the fact that the officer is white and Roberson was black has prompted some \u2014 including a prominent local African-American newspaper columnist \u2014 to question the officer's thinking.\n\n\"I believe a police officer showing up at a chaotic scene where a white man has a gun would have at least hollered for him to put the gun down before opening fire,\" Chicago Sun-Times columnist Mary Mitchell wrote after the shooting. \"But too often, black men are not given the benefit of the doubt.\"\n\nKulis said he is trying to gather information about the officer, who he said came to the Midlothian department four years ago from another department and is a member of a SWAT team.\n\nFootage from surveillance or body cameras could explain whether Roberson was clearly identifiable as a security guard. Audio could determine what, if anything, was said to the officer before the shooting and whether, as witnesses have told the media, they shouted to the officer before he fired that Roberson was a security guard.\n\nSuch footage could also help investigators determine what kind of charges should be filed against the man who is suspected of firing a gun inside the bar. The man was one of four people who suffered non-life threatening gunshot wounds.\n\nIn his $1 million federal lawsuit, Kulis contends that the officer who shot Roberson violated the man's 4th Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\n\"The use of force is considered a seizure, and he needed probable cause to use force and he did not have that,\" he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press researcher Monika Mathur in Washington contributed to this report.", "Canadian actor Douglas Rain, who played some of Shakespeare's most intriguing characters onstage but perhaps is best known for supplying the creepily calm voice of the computer HAL in Stanley Kubrick's \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" has died at 90.\n\nThe Stratford Festival said Rain died Sunday of natural causes at St. Marys Memorial Hospital, just outside of Stratford, Ontario. He was one of the festival's founding company members and spent 32 seasons performing there, until 1998.\n\nHis roles at Stratford included playing Claudio in \"Measure for Measure\" in 1954, Malvolio in \"Twelfth Night\" in 1957, Edgar in \"King Lear\" in 1964 and Prince Hal in \"Henry IV, Part 1\" in 1958, a play and a role he would return to in 1965 and would eventually take on the title role in 1966.\n\nBut it was the aloof voice of the artificially intelligent HAL 9000 \u2014 the forerunner of today's Amazon's Alexa or Google Home \u2014 where Rain entered the public's consciousness. Kubrick had heard Rain's voice in the 1960 documentary \"Universe,\" a film he watched multiple times, according to the actor. Rain was initially hired to narrate 1968's \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" but the director chose to go a different direction.\n\nHAL is the onboard master computer on the spaceship Discovery 1 but goes rogue. When astronaut Dave Bowman asks HAL to open the ships' pod doors, HAL famously balks. \"I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that,\" the machine blandly refuses. \"This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.\"\n\nWhen the astronauts try to disconnect HAL, he fights back. During his shutdown, HAL sings the nursey rhyme \"Daisy Bell\" and memorably utters: \"I'm afraid, Dave. Dave, my mind is going. I can feel it.\" The American Film Institute named HAL the 13th greatest movie villain of all time, joining a list that includes Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vader.\n\nStratford Festival Artistic Director Antoni Cimolino called Rain one of Canada's greatest acting talents and a \"guiding light in its development.\" He said the actor's humanity shone through in HAL.\n\n\"Douglas shared many of the same qualities as Kubrick's iconic creation: precision, strength of steel, enigma and infinite intelligence, as well as a wicked sense of humor,\" Cimolino said. \"But those of us lucky enough to have worked with Douglas soon solved his riddle and discovered that at the center of his mystery lay warmth and humanity, evidenced in his care for the young members of our profession.\"\n\nRain attended the University of Manitoba and studied in London at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. He started out performing radio plays. From 1974 to 1977, Rain was head of the English acting section of the National Theatre School of Canada.\n\nRain performed at theaters and festivals all over Canada, including the Shaw Festival, where he played such roles as Caesar in \"Caesar and Cleopatra\" in 1983. He shared stages with such luminaries as Peter Ustinov, Maggie Smith and Colm Feore. He was nominated for a Tony Award in 1972 for his role as William Cecil in \"Vivat! Vivat! Regina!\" His other Broadway credits include \"The Golden Age\" in 1963 and \"The Broken Jug\" in 1958.\n\nRain is survived by his two sons, David and Adam, daughter Emma, granddaughter, Salima, and a daughter-in-law, Asira.", "Dozens of transgender women and gay men in the caravan moving through Mexico with hopes of seeking asylum in the United States have banded together for protection \u2014 not from the uncertainty of a journey fraught with danger from the gangs who prey on migrants but from their fellow travelers.\n\nFleeing violence and discrimination back home because of their gender identity or sexual orientation, these LGBTQ migrants have found the journey north to be just as threatening amid catcalls and even physical abuse.\n\n\"Sweet little thing!\" ''Baby, where you going?\" ''How much do you charge?\" These all-too-familiar jeers are spewed at them as they make their way with the caravan of several thousand.\n\nLoly Mendez, a 28-year-old who began transitioning to a woman in her native El Salvador, knows all too well the dangers her fellow transgender migrants faced back home: Her best friend, also a transgender woman, was murdered for doing the same.\n\nThen Loly herself began getting threats \u2014 \"that if my breasts were going to grow, they would cut them off,\" she said. They were always anonymously delivered, which only made her more fearful and finally drove her to flee.\n\n\"In my country there is violence, a lack of work and opportunities,\" said Loly, who like many of the transgender women in the group preferred using only her first name. \"In the caravan there is also violence \u2014 against the LGBTQ community.\"\n\nLoly linked up with the caravan in Tapachula, in southern Mexico, and hopes to work in the United States and save up to start a beauty products company \u2014 perhaps in Los Angeles or New York. It's something she has planned for a long time, all the way down to the business' logo, but she's never had the money.\n\n\"I am going to a country where I know I will achieve my dreams,\" Loly said, hopefully.\n\nReports are common in much of Central America of LGBTQ people being murdered, assaulted and discriminated against, due to their gender identity or sexual orientation.\n\nBut getting U.S. asylum is difficult even with proof someone has been the victim of persecution for being transgender, said Lynly Egyes, director of litigation at the Transgender Law Center in Oakland, California.\n\nIt often takes days or weeks for transgender immigrants to get a hearing before an asylum officer. If they are allowed to move forward in the process, many are traumatized and struggle to tell their story, Egyes said. They are also much less likely to be granted asylum without a lawyer.\n\n\"It is a horrifying process, and not everybody makes it through,\" she said.\n\nMany of the migrants have said they joined the caravan because it offered safety in numbers. The 50 or so LGBTQ migrants traveling together, most of them in their 20s but some as young as 17 or as old as 60, say they, too, banded together for safety \u2014 a sort of caravan within the caravan.\n\nSticking out in their bright-colored clothing and makeup, the group has suffered verbal harassment, especially from men, and has been the victim of robbery and other aggressions. One recent day as they walked in a row on the highway to Isla, in the Mexican Gulf coast state of Veracruz, a group of fellow migrants passed by on a flatbed truck and showered them with water, oranges, rinds and other refuse.\n\nFearful of being attacked more violently or sexually assaulted, they stick by each other's sides 24 hours a day, walking and sleeping in a group and even using the buddy system for going to the bathroom.\n\nIn Matias Romero, in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, rather than sleep outdoors they took over an abandoned hotel damaged in last year's deadly earthquake. Dirty, windowless and with no electricity or running water, it was nonetheless a place to have a roof over their heads and be safe. They bathed by the light of a small lantern, dressed themselves and applied makeup as dozens of men milled about outside.\n\nEach night \"the girls,\" as they call themselves, sift through piles of donated clothing to try to look as sharp as possible. And they face a dilemma: Where to dress and relieve themselves?\n\n\"We have problems when it comes time to go to the bathroom,\" said Nakai Flotte, a transgender woman and activist. \"We bathe in the men's, sometimes in the women's, but it's difficult. There isn't one for us.\"\n\nFlotte was accompanying the migrants to provide support and information about making asylum claims.\n\nThe U.S. \"should take into account their condition of vulnerability and violence,\" she said.\n\nHowever, a decision by then Attorney General Jeff Sessions this year to deny asylum to victims of domestic and gang violence could also have a negative impact on transgender women and men because many are victims of gang violence who are targeted for being transgender.\n\n\"I know it will be difficult to win asylum,\" said Alexa Amaya, a 24-year-old from Honduras, \"but we have to make the attempt.\"\n\nThe caravan has traveled more than 1,000 miles (more than 2,000 kilometers) in the month since its initial participants set out from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, and as it traverses Mexico's central highlands it's still about the same distance from its goal of Tijuana, across the border from San Diego. It's unclear how many will make it. A similar caravan earlier this year fizzled to just about 200 who reached the U.S. frontier.\n\nMuch of the trek has been on foot, but hitching rides in pickup trucks, minibuses and tractor-trailers has been crucial lately, especially on days when they travel 100 miles or more. For the LGBTQ group, it's been tougher to find those rides.\n\n\"A taxi driver kicked us out of his car,\" said Lady Perez, a 23-year-old from Honduras, adding that sometimes truck drivers who often transport migrants for a small fee have doubled or tripled the price for her group.\n\nLady began identifying as transgender at age 5, and her father ultimately disowned her. She was subjected to insults and beatings, her boyfriend was killed and she was warned to leave Honduras or else.\n\n\"In our country the rights of the LGBTQ community are not respected, and anti-social groups take advantage of that,\" Lady said.\n\nWalking on the highway in a black miniskirt, red lipstick and black eyeliner, she said many men in the caravan have been harassing her and the others.\n\n\"They have denigrated us. Supposedly you're emigrating from your country because of the violence, the discrimination, the homophobia, and it turns out that in the very caravan you face this kind of violence,\" she said.\n\nIn the face of the near-constant harassment, march organizers and human rights workers have sought to provide the group some security in the form of two men in green vests who travel with them and try to ward off any attacks.\n\nIf the verbal harassment doesn't cross the line, \"we feel protected,\" Loly said. \"If someone does cross the line, human rights is with us to protect us.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Astrid Galvan in Phoenix contributed to this report.", "Karen Pence, the vice president's wife, announced Tuesday a $54,000 U.S. grant to Tsukuba University in Japan for studying art therapy, a little-known mental health profession she has championed under the Trump administration.\n\nPence was in Japan while accompanying her husband, Mike Pence, on a trip through Asia for a series of meetings, including a Southeast Asian summit in Singapore and an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Papua New Guinea.\n\nKaren Pence declined to answer questions during an interview with The Associated Press about opposition in Japan to the presence of the U.S. military and about the recent U.S. midterm elections that saw her husband's Republican Party lose control of the House of Representatives. Instead, the focus was on art therapy, which uses craft work to help people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, autism or other mental illnesses, as well as children with cancer.\n\n\"When we go all over the world and observe art therapy, it's used frequently with people who are having some kind of depression, or stress or trauma, anxiety, anger issues,\" Pence said in the interview while attending a meeting with art therapists and other guests at the U.S. ambassador's residence in Tokyo.\n\nArt therapy has also been reported as effective for people in the military dealing with suicidal thoughts, depression and nightmares. In Japan, it has also been used for hospitalized children and women experiencing domestic abuse.\n\nJapan does not yet have a system to authorize art therapists, and people who want to study it have had to go to the United States or Great Britain. Akie Abe, the wife of the Japanese prime minister, told an audience during the meeting that she appreciated Pence's efforts to promote art therapy in Japan.\n\nSupporting the spouses of U.S. troops is another interest for Pence, who is not an art therapist. She is a water color artist. She met with such spouses at the ambassador's residence, and called their work as crucial as military service.\n\n\"We find it very effective with spouses and children,\" she said of the use of art therapy. \"Probably the most important is to get it for our service members who have injuries. But the other important thing is to make spouses aware of it.\"\n\nAmy Snyder, the wife of a U.S. Army soldier stationed at Camp Zama, near Tokyo, stood in line to get a special bracelet Pence hands out to spouses to show gratitude for their work.\n\n\"It was amazing, and I liked how she was talking to us,\" she said.", "Now Playing: Marvel Comics legend Stan Lee dies at 95\n\nNow Playing: Stan Lee, the man who brought superheroes to life, dies at 95\n\nNow Playing: The hilarious Kristin Chenoweth and her adorable puppy visit 'GMA Day'\n\nNow Playing: Kristin Chenoweth on teaming up with Whoopi Goldberg for 'I'm Coming Home'\n\nNow Playing: Michael B.

Drugs. Murder. ... That is what this case is about,\" Fels said.\n\nDefense attorney Jeffrey Lichtman sought to shift blame in his opening to Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, another reputed drug trafficker in the cartel's leadership who is still at large in Mexico. The lawyer claimed that unlike Guzman, Zambada remains on the loose because of bribes that \"go up to the very top,\" including hundreds of millions of dollars paid to the current and former presidents of Mexico.\n\nHe also suggested U.S. law enforcement turned a blind eye to the situation.\n\nIn a tweet, a spokesman for current President Enrique Pena Nieto called the sensational allegation \"completely false and defamatory.\" A separate tweet by ex-President Felipe Calderon called it \"absolutely false and reckless.\"\n\nOne of Zambata's sons is expected to be the first of several government cooperators to testify against Guzman, possibly as early as Wednesday.\n\nGuzman, who has been held in solitary confinement since his extradition to the United States early last year, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he amassed a multi-billion-dollar fortune smuggling tons of cocaine and other drugs in a vast supply chain that reached well north of the border.\n\nDespite his diminutive stature and nickname that means \"Shorty\" in Spanish, Guzman was once a larger-than-life figure in Mexico who has been compared to Al Capone and Robin Hood and been the subject of ballads known as narcocorridos. He appeared in a dark suit and tie on Tuesday as he listened to Fels describe how he started modestly in the early 1970s by selling marijuana in Mexico, but built his reputation by constructing tunnels across the Mexico-U.S. border to transport marijuana and cocaine so fast that he was \"no longer El Chapo, the short one.\"\n\nInstead, he became known as \"the speedy one.\" Before his tunnels, it had taken weeks to move drugs across the border to the U.S.\n\nBefore long, Guzman was receiving 10 to 15 planes \"stuffed with cocaine\" each day from Colombia at landing strips in Mexico for transport to cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, Fels said.\n\nAs his business flourished using the tunnels, trains, planes and vessels, Guzman began taking aim at rivals in the early 1990s, leading to bloody wars. In 1993, he fled to Guatemala but was captured and imprisoned in Mexico for eight years, where he continued running his drug empire, Fels said.\n\nThe prosecutor spoke of two dramatic escapes from prison by Guzman and said he was planning a third when he was brought to the U.S. One of his escapes in 2015 was through a mile-long tunnel dug into a shower in his jail cell that he slipped into before fleeing on a motorcycle.\n\nThe tunnel escape was a black eye for the Mexican government, an embarrassment amplified when the actor Sean Penn was able to find and interview him at one of his hideouts in Mexico while he was on the run from authorities.\n\nFels said Guzman used some of his wealth to pay off the Mexican military and police and to finance assault rifles, grenade launchers and explosives to engage in \"war after bloody war.\" He accused the defendant of personally shooting two men and having their bodies burned.\n\nGuzman's attorney told jurors it would have been impossible for him to be in charge of the cartel since he was either in jail or hiding out in the Mexican countryside during the entire time U.S. prosecutors claim he was the leader.\n\nSome of the cooperators will \"tell you he has no money,\" Lichtman said.\n\nAn email written by a U.S. agent who eavesdropped on Guzman for a year wrote, \"Chapo was more of a myth than an actual legend,\" and that he was \"not impressed\" by him, the lawyer added.\n\nOpening statements were delayed about six hours on Tuesday after two jurors were dismissed for hardships and were replaced in a proceeding in another courtroom. Dozens of members of the media and other spectators were left waiting in the trial courtroom and in an overflow room with a warning that they would lose their seats to people in a long line outside if they stepped away.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Peter Orsi in Mexico City contributed to this report.", "Sidewalk prayers near shoot-up spots. Sunday sermons in the back of a bar. Pleas to struggling souls to surrender to God. Funerals for members of their flock who didn't make it.\n\nClergy members have become spiritual first responders in the opioid crisis, often leaving the pulpit to minister on the streets.\n\nThey can be reverends, rabbis, priests or pastors. Though their faiths differ, they invariably approach people with addiction as equals. No Bible-thumping, no blaming. Quite a few are in recovery themselves.\n\nDespite some signs of a slowdown, the nation's all-time deadliest drug overdose epidemic endures. Opioids were involved in most of the deaths, killing nearly 48,000 people last year.\n\nA spiritual element to recovery is familiar to people who have worked 12-step programs, with their references to an undefined higher power. Scientific studies have found evidence that religious faith can help substance abusers with their recovery.\n\nWorking with addicted people means trips to hospital rooms and fresh graves. But there are flashes of light in the darkness, too.\n\nThree dispatches from the front lines:\n\nA CHURCH FOR IMPERFECT PEOPLE\n\nNine minutes into his sermon, Pastor Brad Hill made a confession.\n\n\"I gotta be honest. I ask myself a lot of the times, 'God, why did you allow me to be an addict?\" Hill says from the pulpit of his Grace Downtown Church. \"Why are my friends dying of an overdose? ... I gotta ask God, 'Why, God, do you allow this?'\"\n\nHill hears those questions a lot.\n\nThe church Hill started in the back of a Winchester, Virginia, bar moved this year to a space that can accommodate hundreds, many trying to turn the page on their addictions. Six and a half years in recovery, Hill calls it a totally judgment-free zone, \"a church for imperfect people.\"\n\nHill has a salty beard, smiling eyes and booming voice to sermonize about the suffering he sees so often in the Shenandoah Valley. His phone lights up constantly with messages from struggling people and their loved ones. One recent text read: \"Do those who commit suicide still go to heaven?\"\n\nToo often, Hill speaks at funerals for overdose victims, three in the past three months alone. He honors the dead while telling survivors, \"You don't have to be like this person. There is a way out.\"\n\nA funeral in September for a 38-year-old married father of four was especially hard on Hill. They were friends, and Hill had been talking to him about his struggle just a week before he died. It was Hill who welcomed the man's grieving family to a Sunday service.\n\n\"They lost one of ...\" Hill swallowed, clapped his hands together twice, and continued in a softer voice. \"They lost one of my favorite people. So I just ask that we pray real quick for them, OK?\"\n\nHill's own addiction to painkillers led to a prescription fraud conviction in 2007 and a yearlong jail sentence that cost him a thriving church in Virginia Beach.\n\nAbout four years ago, he came to Winchester and started Sunday services in the backroom of a downtown bar called Brewbaker's for a handful of people struggling with addiction. They'd drop a sheet over the liquor bottles before services.\n\nIt grew by attracting people like Matthew Fanning, who met Hill at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting.\n\nHill would talk about spirituality, but Fanning wasn't ready to hear it until he relapsed into heroin addiction. Hill visited him in rehab in 2015, encouraged him and gave him Bible-based homework.\n\nFanning is now in recovery and a Grace Downtown regular.\n\n\"You don't have to come in your quote-unquote Sunday best,\" Fanning said. \"You come as you are, whether you're struggling, or whether you don't believe, or whether you're just curious.\"\n\nThe nondenominational church moved this year to a nearby strip mall with room to seat 400.\n\nWhile some churches merely welcome the homeless, Grace Downtown picks them up in a van. Other worshippers come from local rehabilitation centers. Hill estimates that more than half who show up on Sundays are in recovery or related to someone who is.\n\n\"I have folks that come in that just got high the night before,\" Hill says. \"I've got folks that overdosed the night before. I've got folks who have lost everything.\"\n\nNEVER STOP GETTING OUR HANDS DIRTY\n\nPastor Jamie Casey prays with addicted people all over New Bedford, Massachusetts. He joins hands with them in their living rooms days after overdoses, in hospital emergency rooms and on sidewalks in front of wind-beaten houses in this struggling city.\n\nThe 45-year-old associate pastor in a nondenominational church is part of a team of clergy from a variety of faiths who regularly crisscross town with police officers and counselors. Their goal is to get people into treatment and, if they will listen, to offer some spiritual advice.\n\n\"Surrender,\" Casey told Brian Peets, who stepped out from his makeshift shelter beneath a railroad track platform.\n\n\"I can't,\" Peets said.\n\n\"Surrender.\"\n\n\"I can't right now.\"\n\n\"Surrender,\" Casey repeated, alluding to his own addictions that started with alcohol and cocaine.\n\n\"For 20 years I fought and fought and fought against myself. Because you're your biggest enemy. You know that, right?\" he told Peets. \"So what ended up happening is that I ended up in a place that I lost almost everything. But then I had to surrender to this addiction, surrender to my circumstances, surrender to myself and then surrender to God.\"\n\nNew Bedford logged 56 opioid-related overdose deaths last year, a per-capita rate a third higher than nearby Boston. Police hope such outreach ride-alongs can get struggling people into treatment before the next setback.\n\nThe three-person teams cold-call homes where there have recently been overdoses to see if anyone wants help.\n\nOn a recent evening, Casey put on his shirt with \"CHAPLAIN\" on the back to ride with Officer Scott Carola and counselor Peter Lagasse around the city in an unmarked car.\n\nCasey had a list of addresses of recent overdoses. But when they knocked on doors, most people either weren't home or weren't answering.\n\nThe trio was unfazed.\n\nThe person who ignores you today might embrace you tomorrow, said the Rev. David Lima, who heads the Inter-Church Council of Greater New Bedford and directs the program.\n\nOnly a small percentage will get treatment, but participating clergy contend that it's about more than numbers. Says Rabbi Raphael Kanter, quoting the Talmud, \"if you save one life, it's as if you've saved the whole world.\"\n\nThey spotted James Sessine talking to friends on a busy corner outside a food market. The 29-year-old has struggled with addiction and recently has been living in a tent.\n\nSessine's friends scattered as the car stopped, but he stayed and listened to Casey's suggestion that he get a treatment slot.\n\nCasey called a provider. Can they give him a time tomorrow? Yes.\n\nSessine got on the phone and promised he'll be ready the next morning, meanwhile, \"I'm going to walk around all night, like I do every night.\"\n\nSessine ended the call and hugged Casey.\n\n\"I shoot heroin daily,\" Sessine explained a few minutes later, \"and it's coming to the point where enough is enough.\"\n\nCasey says his preaching, teaching and intervening is all part of his goal to \"love people back to life.\"\n\n\"My best friend and I, we made a deal,\" Casey said, his voice catching. \"He looked at me and he said, 'Promise me we'll never stop getting our hands dirty,' And I made that promise to him and God, because had people given up on me, I wouldn't be here.\"\n\nThey picked up Sessine the next morning.\n\nCasey looked for Peets too, but could not find him.\n\nFRIARS FLYING THE JESUS FLAG\n\nWith his bushy beard and long gray robe cinched by a rope, the Rev. Giuseppe Siniscalchi would look at home illuminating manuscript in a monastery. But he and his fellow Franciscan friars are familiar figures on the sidewalks of Newburgh, New York.\n\nThey walk in pairs by row houses, empty storefronts and shoot-up spots in this Hudson River city. They offer people hot chocolate, iced tea or bagels along with their Roman Catholic blessings.\n\n\"When we approach the people on the street, whether they're addicted, whether they're even drunk, or whether they're high at the moment or they're a prostitute, whatever's going in in their life, we want to approach them first of all in love,\" Siniscalchi says.\n\nOn one afternoon walking with the Rev.

Diez de Medina greeted some people in Spanish.\n\nA dark-haired woman ran up to them from across the street and proudly told him about her recovery.\n\nShe acted calmly, different from when Siniscalchi saw her sitting restlessly in a parked car months ago. He offered to pray for her. The two friars laid a hand on her shoulders as they all bowed their heads on the sidewalk.\n\nShe closed her eyes so tightly her nose crinkled.\n\nThe friars are not specifically looking for people struggling with drugs, but they make a point of walking past some of the most troubled corners of Newburgh.\n\nThis once-grand city about an hour north of New York City has a poverty rate higher than that of the Bronx. For every fixed-up row house, there is another run down or abandoned. A hospital two blocks from the friary reported that it saved the lives of 205 overdose patients over a year's time.\n\n\"There been a few times where I've come across people with their little hypodermic needle kit ready to shoot up ... and you just say, 'Hi. How are you? How you doing,'\" Siniscalchi says. \"They kind of recognize or get a sense of who we are, and a conversation ensues.\"\n\nThe friars moved to an old church rectory here in 2016, establishing the St. Mary of the Assumption Friary. They take turns on the four-times-a-week walkabouts with Brother Peter Anthony Curtis.\n\nIn recent months, they started dispensing drinks from a metal cart they push down the streets. The rubber-wheeled cart sports a Jesus flag and a picture of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a resonant image in a city with a robust Hispanic population.\n\nAfter two years, the sight of robed men with long beards chatting up people barely draws second glances. Quite a few people chat.\n\nOn one walk, a middle-aged bicyclist asked, \"You guys Catholics or something?\" He then had his silver crucifix blessed. A passing woman took a blue plastic crucifix that matched her clothes. At one point, Siniscalchi sat down next to a downcast woman, pulled out a crucifix and told her Jesus loves her.\n\n\"People don't,\" she replied, looking down.\n\nThat doesn't matter, he said, Jesus does.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the friars said goodbye to go greet more souls.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMichael Hill is a multi-format AP journalist based in Albany, New York.

Add Amazon as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Amazon news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nThe Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, just across the East River from Manhattan, and Crystal City in northern Virginia, were selected for the so-called HQ2 by the retail giant after a search commenced last year with 238 hopefuls tossing their hats into the ring.\n\nAmazon will invest $5 billion in the new sites, which will create 50,000 new jobs, the company said in a press release.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to build new headquarters in New York City and Northern Virginia,\u201d said Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, in a statement. \u201cThese two locations will allow us to attract world-class talent that will help us to continue inventing for customers for years to come. The team did a great job selecting these sites, and we look forward to becoming an even bigger part of these communities.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Amazon started to refer to its northern Virginia site as \"National Landing,\" which surprised and upset some longtime residents, sending shockwaves onto social media. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam confirmed the renaming of Crystal City in an interview Tuesday on CNBC.\n\nNashville was also picked as Amazon's new \"Center of Excellence for its Operations business, which is responsible for the company\u2019s customer fulfillment, transportation, supply chain, and other similar activities,\" the company stated. Five thousand jobs will be added there.\n\nHiring at these new locations will begin in 2019.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the news.\n\nWhat's in the deal\n\nIn the deals Amazon struck with the cities, the company gained billions of dollars in incentives, in addition to free publicity and valuable data about the 238 cities which initially bid for the company's business.\n\nNew York will get a Long Island City campus of up to four million square feet, which could eventually rise up to eight million, the promise of 25,000 to 40,000 new jobs, and an investment up to $3.69 billion over 15 years, the company said in its press release. New York could also expect an estimated incremental tax revenue of more than $10 billion over the next 20 years.\n\nFrom its new split headquarters, Amazon is in place to get more than $2 billion in tax incentives, according to the company's statement. New York offered $1.7 billion of incentives if the company does in fact create the 40,000 jobs. Virginia could bestow up to $550 million in cash incentives to the company, that number is also tied to the number of jobs it creates.\n\nTennesee offered $65 million in cash grants if Amazon creates 5,000 jobs over seven years and $21.7 million in state tax credits, also based on the number of jobs created.\n\nSusan Walsh/AP\n\nHowever, many economists say that economic development subsidies don't work, partly because companies have an idea of where they will relocate without such incentives. Amazon, for its part, has said it was hard to find a talent pool 50,000 deep in most American cities.\n\n\"Amazon's choice is unlikely to be premised on gaining the maximum subsidy from each location. Most recent mega-subsidies of this sort are at least partially structured as proportional to the number of new jobs and size of capital investment, meaning that there's less opportunity for Amazon to double-dip\u2014but that doesn't mean they won't try!\" said Michael Farren, a research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.\n\n\"Instead, the decision to split HQ2 seems premised on being able to hire enough skilled workers to support Amazon's stratospheric growth into the future; Amazon wants to be able to hire the best of the best from each location,\" added Farren, who recently published a study on Amazon's search for its second headquarters entitled, \"Amazon HQ2 Is the Only Competition Where the Losers Are Winners.\"\n\nImmediate blowback\n\nDespite praise from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, both of whom campaigned aggressively for the Amazon project, the announcement was met with local resistance.\n\nNew York state Sen. Michael Gianaris of Queens and City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer issued a joint statement saying, \"We have serious reservations about the reported deal to bring Amazon to LIC. Offering massive corporate welfare from scarce public resources to one of the wealthiest corporations in the world at a time of great need in our state is just wrong. The burden should not be on the 99 percent to prove we are worthy of the one percent\u2019s presence in our communities, but rather on Amazon to prove it would be a responsible corporate neighbor.\"\n\nOther critics dismissed the 14-month search for a new headquarters as a publicity stunt or an attempt to extract valuable information from cities that Amazon could use to make future decisions that would benefit the company with an unfair advantage over its competitors.\n\n\"This wasn't a contest, but a con. An elegant transfer of resources (data, time and money) from municipalities to Amazon shareholders. HQ2 will go down as one of the great PR stunts, and abuses of the commonwealth, in corporate history,\" Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University's Stern Business School, wrote ABC News in an email.\n\nABC News' Rebecca Jarvis and Karma Allen contributed to this report", "China is postponing its decision to allow trading in tiger and rhinoceros parts a bare two weeks after the easing of the ban had raised fears the country was giving legal cover to poaching and smuggling of endangered wildlife.\n\nThe official Xinhua News Agency quoted Cabinet official Ding Xuedong as saying Monday that the change had \"been postponed after study.\"\n\n\"Relevant departments of the Chinese government will soon continue to organize special crackdown campaigns with focus on addressing the illegal trade of rhinos, tigers and their byproducts. Illegal acts will be dealt with severely,\" Ding, an executive deputy secretary-general of the State Council was quoted as saying.\n\nThe Xinhua report said the ban on the import and export of rhino and tiger parts and their use in traditional Chinese medicine would also be maintained. Ding's comments did not address whether the postponement meant the decision would be revived.\n\nThe traditional medicinal uses of tiger bone and rhino horn have continued despite no proof of their effectiveness and the decreasing wild populations. China has also long tolerated the farming of tigers and the semi-legal sale of their parts.\n\nLate last month, authorities said they would allow trading in products made from tigers and rhinos under \"special circumstances,\" bringing condemnation from conservation groups. Farming of non-native rhinos is not known in China but the changing law raised speculation it was being planned.\n\nThe World Wildlife Fund said overturning the ban would have \"devastating consequences globally\" by allowing poachers and smugglers to hide behind legalized trade.\n\nChina's authoritarian Communist Party-led government rarely responds to international pressure and the reversal appeared to reflect concerns over the country's reputation as a supporter of environmental preservation. China, home to the highly endangered giant panda, has frequently been named as a top market for endangered wildlife products including ivory and skin from African elephants and meat and scales from the anteater-like pangolin, native to Africa and southern Asia.\n\nReacting to the latest development, the Humane Society International and the Humane Society of the United States called for China to completely ban the trade in tiger and rhino products.\n\n\"To truly protect tigers and rhinos we need an official written proclamation from the State Council that permanently reinstates a complete ban. Full stop,\" Iris Ho, senior specialist for Wildlife Program and Policy at Humane Society International was quoted as saying in a news release. \"Species extinction is irreversible and we cannot afford any missteps,\" Ho said.\n\nAlong with other animal protection organizations, the Humane Society International and the Humane Society of the United States have filed a legal appeal for a ban on U.S. imports of all wildlife and their parts from China \"unless or until China formally reinstates a complete ban on domestic trade in tigers and rhinos and their parts and products,\" the groups said in a statement.\n\nAn estimated 3,890 tigers remain alive in the wild, according to a report presented during the Third Asia Ministerial Conference on Tiger Conservation in 2016. Studies put the population of wild rhinos at less than 30,000, while poaching to cultivate their horns is reducing that number drastically each year.", "The annual gathering of Southeast Asian leaders began Tuesday with a warning from the host, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, about threats against international rules that underpin world stability and economic growth.\n\n\"The international order is at a turning point,\" Lee said at the opening ceremony of the summit of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\n\n\"The existing free, open and rules-based multilateral system, which has underpinned ASEAN's growth and stability, has come under stress,\" Lee said.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's \"America First\" foreign policy and his resistance to multilateral agreements and institutions are viewed as an affront and a challenge in a region whose modern economies are largely driven by global trade.\n\nAmong issues on the agenda for ASEAN and other leaders attending meetings in Singapore this week, including U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, are talks on a new regional trade pact that would commit member countries and others in the Asian-Pacific region to opening markets further.\n\nLee said ASEAN and other participating countries including India and China, but not the United States, have made \"substantive progress\" on the market-opening initiative, called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.\n\nHowever, it's unclear if a deal will be reached in Singapore.

Though she didn\u2019t directly endorse McSally, she did call on Arizonans to work together \u201cwin or lose.\u201d\n\nSinema focused less on tying her campaign to the larger Democratic party, rarely mentioning her party affiliation in her campaign ads and instead describing herself as an independent.\n\nDemocrats were optimistic about their chances to turn the state from red to purple, hoping that changing demographics in the state and potential distaste of the Trump administration could help catapult Sinema to victory.\n\nPreliminary exit poll results suggested that health care was a huge issue for Arizona voters, with 41 percent saying that it was the most important topic to them, squeezing out ahead of immigration, which 32 percent of Arizonans said was their top issue.\n\nBoth topics were major points of discussion on the campaign trail. Sinema said that access to affordable health care was a topic that frequently came up when she spoke with voters, and that became a difficult point for McSally who had to defend her vote, which was in line with the Trump administration, in support of the proposed Republican repeal of Obamacare.\n\nArizonans were among some of the first in the country to start casting ballots, with early voting starting in the Grand Canyon state on Oct. 10. And that didn\u2019t stop voters from turning out on Election Day.\n\n\u201cThis election is looking more like a presidential election in the amount of ballots,\u201d Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes said on Election Day.", "Transcript for Martha McSally concedes Arizona Senate race to Kyrsten Sinema\n\nEverybody just call this isn't my fingers in her becoming airs on his first you know senator after a hard.

In addition to Russian and Chinese telecommunications companies, a Nigerian internet provider was also involved.\n\nThe diversion \"at a minimum caused a massive denial of service to G Suite (business collaboration tools) and Google Search\" and \"put valuable Google traffic in the hands of ISPs in (internet service providers) in countries with a long history of Internet surveillance,\" the network-intelligence company ThousandEyes said in a blog post.\n\nA Google status page noted that \"access to some Google services was impacted\" and said the cause was \" external to Google .\" The company offered little additional information.\n\nThe type of traffic misdirection employed, known as border gateway protocol hijacking, can knock essential services offline and facilitate espionage and financial theft. It can result either from misconfiguration \u2014 human error, essentially\u2014 or from malicious action.\n\nMost network traffic to Google services \u2014 94 percent as of October 27 \u2014 is encrypted, which shields it from prying eyes even if diverted.\n\nAlex Henthorn-Iwane, an executive at ThousandEyes, called Monday's incident the worst affecting Google that his San Francisco company has seen.\n\nHe said he suspected nation-state involvement because the traffic was effectively landing at state-run China Telecom. A recent study by U.S. Naval War College and Tel Aviv University scholars found that China systematically hijacks and diverts U.S. internet traffic.\n\nGoogle said it had no reason to believe the traffic hijacking was malicious. It did not explain why.\n\nMuch of the internet's underpinnings are built on trust, a relic of the good intentions its designers assumed of users. One consequence: little can be done if a nation-state or someone with access to a major internet provider \u2014 or exchange \u2014 decides to reroute traffic.\n\nHenthorn-Iwane says Monday's hijacking may have been \"a war-game experiment.\"\n\nIn two recent cases, such rerouting has affected financial sites. In April 2017, one affected MasterCard and Visa among other sites. This past April, another hijacking enabled cryptocurrency theft .\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThousandEyes named the companies involved in Monday's incident, in addition to China Telecom, as the Russian internet provider Transtelecom and the Nigerian ISP MainOne.\n\nBoth ThousandEyes and the U.S. network monitoring company BGPmon said the internet traffic detour originated with the Nigerian company. Neither was ready to more definitively pinpoint the cause.", "Abul Kalam sits cross-legged on the floor of his tiny mud hut and whispers prayers into a small plastic bottle filled with water, creating what he says is a potion that will cure stomach cramps.\n\n\"I got these powers in my dreams,\" he says. \"People come to me because I heal them.\"\n\nKalam is a boidu, or faith healer, and for decades has been treating fellow Rohingya Muslims, first in Myanmar's northern Rakhine state and now in a squalid camp in Bangladesh, where 700,000 Rohingya took refuge last year after escaping a campaign of government violence at home.\n\nFaith healers have long been sought out in Rohingya society to treat physical and mental ailments. Their trade has thrived in part because of traditional beliefs and in part because Rohingya have lacked access to modern medical care in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where they are one of the most persecuted minority groups in the world.\n\nAccess to medical care has changed for the better in Bangladesh, where thousands of aid workers offer Rohingya everything from vaccinations to psychological support.\n\nDoctors Without Borders, which runs four inpatient hospitals and a dozen medical centers in the area, says it has provided more than 800,000 outpatient consultations and admitted more than 15,000 patients since August 2017.\n\nYet many Rohingya still seek out their faith healers.\n\nKalam, a 60-year-old who arrived in Bangladesh in 2012 in an earlier exodus of Rohingya, says he receives more than five clients each day.\n\n\"People come to me because they benefit from my power,\" he says. \"That's why they keep coming back.\"\n\nMyanmar officials have said they expect the repatriation of Rohingya to start this week, a move criticized by rights groups who say it is not yet safe for them to return.\n\nAnita Saha, a clinical psychologist who has worked in the camps since August 2017, says Rohingya refugees' dependence on faith healers stems from a lack of exposure to doctors and a suspicion of scientific medicine.\n\nShe says many refugees mistakenly believe they will lose their Islamic faith and be converted to Christianity if they take vaccinations for diseases like cholera and diphtheria. And in the case of mental illness, she says, many believe it is a reflection of evil forces and is best countered by a faith healer invoking prayer.\n\n\"They don't have any doctors to prescribe psychotropic drugs. So, they believe in the boidus to overcome their problem,\" Saha says.\n\nShe says beliefs in the camps are slowly changing.\n\nAli Nesa has never known what's wrong with her teenage daughter, who spends her days in the refugee camp lying on the floor of her family's thatch hut, unable to talk, walk or eat on her own.\n\nNesa says her daughter has been this way since she was 3, when she had epileptic fits for nearly two weeks straight.\n\n\"I don't know if her disease is due to an evil spirit or because of difficulty in breathing,\" Nesa says. \"If this is because of an evil spirit, then only a boidu can treat her. If it is a breathing problem, then a doctor may be able to help her.\"\n\nNesa says none of the many boidus she has visited has been able to help her daughter and she is losing her faith in them. She's now interested in seeking medical help.\n\nClimate extremes, harsh land and unsanitary conditions make the camps a breeding ground for diseases and mental stress.\n\nThat means there's plenty of work for doctors. It also means there's plenty of business for faith healers like Kalam, who says he's doing Allah's bidding and isn't bothered by people who don't believe in his powers.\n\n\"I can't be worried by what people have to say,\" he says.\n\n\"Maybe the doctor will say what does a boidu know? I don't want to answer them. I don't need to fight them.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Rishabh R.

He promotes it as a regional economic development project that would share the economic boom of Cancun's world class beach resorts with poorer, more remote parts of the south.\n\nAnother project on the ballot will be construction of an oil refinery in his home state of Tabasco as well as social programs such as giving scholarships to students and pensions to seniors.\n\nLopez Obrador said he would openly push for public support because they are campaign promises. He won election July 1 in a resounding victory and will take office Dec. 1.\n\nThe referendum, like the last one, will be conduction by a private nonprofit, the Rosenblueth Foundation.\n\nThousands of people marched in Mexico City on Sunday in favor of the new airport project and against the idea of public referendums.\n\nThe proposed \"Mayan train\" would run from Cancun south through Tulum and to the Mayan ruins of Palenque. A spur would include the cities of Campeche, Merida and Valladolid. Lopez Obrador previously said it would cost $6 billion to $8 billion.\n\nThe region is full of jungle, wetlands, wildlife reserves and pre-Hispanic archaeological sites, but Lopez Obrador said Monday that there would be no environmental impact. He said it would be offset by a simultaneous project to plant about 250,000 acres (100,000 hectares) of fruit and timber trees in southern Mexico.\n\n\"The truth is that I have polls and I'm very confident that the people are going to vote to build the Mayan train, because it won't hurt anyone.
