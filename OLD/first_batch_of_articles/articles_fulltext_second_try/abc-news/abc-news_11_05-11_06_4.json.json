Brent Taylor said Tuesday that it was \"fitting\" that the remains of her slain husband were returned to the United States on Election Day. Taylor, a Utah National Guardsman who was also the mayor of North Ogden, Utah, was slain in an insider attack in Afghanistan this past weekend.\n\nIn his final Facebook posting a week ago Taylor had encouraged everyone to vote and offered a reminder \"that we have far more as Americans that unites us than divides us.\"\n\nUtah National Guard via AP\n\nTaylor's remains were returned to Dover Air Force Base early Tuesday morning.\n\nAn Army honor guard carried the flag-draped transfer case containing his remains from a civilian transport plane into a transfer vehicle.\n\nTop Army and National Guard officials were on hand to support Taylor's widow and the two oldest of their seven children.\n\nSteve Ruark/AP\n\n\"I personally cannot find words adequate to tell you all that I feel as I stand here this morning by the dawn's early light,\" Jennie Taylor later told reporters. \"And so I echo the words someone recently shared with me, Brent may have died on Afghan soil but he died for the success of freedom and democracy in both of our countries.\"\n\n\"It seems only fitting that Brent who in death now represents so much more than anything, something so much greater than any of our own individual lives, has come home to U.S. soil in a flag-draped casket on our election day,\" she said.\n\n\"It is timeless and cherished honor to serve in our country\u2019s armed services.

Add Midterm Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Midterm Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nNational Exit Poll\n\nDonald Trump and control of Congress are front and center in this election, and preliminary results from the state and national exit polls touch on both of them:\n\nIn results so far, 44 percent of voters approve of Trump\u2019s job performance, while 55 percent disapprove.\n\nAnd while the House races will be fought district by district, voters by 53-43 percent say they\u2019d rather see the Democrats than the Republicans in control of the House after this election.\n\nAntipathy toward Trump doesn\u2019t reach majority support for impeachment \u2013 41 percent of voters support impeaching the president and removing him from office, with 55 percent opposed. Still, 39 percent say they cast their ballots to show opposition to Trump, vs. 26 percent who say they voted to show him support. (33 percent say he didn\u2019t figure in their vote.)\n\nThere are vast divisions among groups on Trump and control of Congress, and voters recognize today\u2019s political polarization. Seventy-seven percent say Americans are becoming more politically divided, while just 8 percent see greater unity; 13 percent see no change.\n\nJim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIndeed, even with the economy its best in decades by many measures, just 41 percent say the country is headed in the right direction, while 56 percent say it\u2019s seriously off on the wrong track. There\u2019s a huge gulf between Republicans and Democrats on the question, but among independents, often swing voters, 58 percent say wrong track vs. 39 percent right direction.\n\nWhile preliminary exit poll results indicate a preference for Democratic control of the House, neither party is beloved. Voters divide 50-46 percent in favorable vs. unfavorable views of the Democratic Party. The GOP fares worse \u2013 43-54 percent, favorable-unfavorable. Nancy Pelosi, a Republican bugaboo in the campaign, trails her party\u2019s favorability rating - and Trump's approval rating - at 31-55 percent, favorable-unfavorable.\n\nIn one more eye-opening preliminary result: 51 percent of voters today say the government has not done enough to protect this election from foreign interference.\n\nIn terms of group sizes \u2013 which can change, these are preliminary results only:\n\nParty ID: Democrats account for 38 percent of voters in exit poll results so far, Republicans for 32 percent and independents for 30 percent. That compares with 36-37-27 percent in 2014, and 37-33-29 percent in 2016.\n\nIdeology: Liberal-moderate-conservative group sizes in results so far are 27-38-36 percent. That compares with 22-39-38 percent in the 2014 midterms. (And 26-38-36 percent in 2016.)\n\nSex: Women account for 52 percent of voters in preliminary results, matching their previous high in a midterm from 2010.\n\nLindsey Wasson/Reuters\n\nKey Issues\n\nAmong key issues in the campaign \u2013 beyond Trump himself \u2013 preliminary exit poll results indicate the following:\n\nImmigration: With the Central American caravan drawing broad attention in the campaign, voters divide on Trump\u2019s immigration policies \u2013 48 percent say they\u2019re too tough, 32 percent say they\u2019re about right and 16 percent say they\u2019re not tough enough.\n\nHealth care: Voters by 58-34 percent pick the Democratic Party over the Republicans as more likely to protect health care for people with pre-existing conditions, another central focus of the 2018 campaign.\n\nFurther, given a choice of four issues, 41 percent pick health care as the top issue facing the country, compared with 21 percent for the economy, 23 percent immigration and 11 percent gun policy. (We\u2019ll look at vote preferences in each group as the night proceeds.)\n\nKavanaugh: Any impact of the controversial confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court may come down to state-to-state races. Nationally, the country divides \u2013 43 percent support his confirmation, 48 percent oppose it in preliminary exit poll results.\n\nTax and trade: Two of the president\u2019s signature economic policies get a mixed reception. Fewer than a third of voters, 28 percent, say they\u2019ve been helped by the Trump tax law (45 percent no impact, 23 percent hurt by it.) And just 25 percent say Trump\u2019s trade policies have helped their local economy. 31 percent say they\u2019ve hurt, 36 percent say they've had no effect.\n\nWomen: Women account for 53 percent of voters in preliminary exit poll results, numerically a record midterm high (albeit by just 1 point from 2010). They\u2019re voting for Democratic House candidates by 60-39 percent. And there\u2019s a tremendous gender gap in views of president Trump\u2019s work in office: While men voting today divide 50-49 percent on Trump, approve-disapprove, that goes to 39-60 percent among women voters. And while 57 percent of men approve of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, just 43 percent of women agree.\n\nSharp gender differences extend elsewhere. Voters by 78-20 percent call it important to elect more women to public office; 53 percent of women call it \u201cvery\u201d important, vs. do 37 percent of men. That may play out in the unusual number of races including female candidates this year.\n\nAnd 84 percent of voters today call sexual harassment a serious problem in the United States, including 47 percent who call it very serious. 52 percent of women vs. 40 percent of men call sexual harassment a very serious problem. In an even bigger gap, 64 percent of Democrats call it very serious, vs. 40 percent of independents and 29 percent of Republicans.\n\nElizabeth Frantz/Reuters\n\nMore On Groups And Issues\n\nRace: Turnout by racial and ethnic minorities is key to Democrats\u2019 chances in many contests. Preliminary exit poll results can change, but in these early results nonwhites account for 29 percent of voters nationally; as noted, the highest in any midterm was 25 percent in 2014. That nonwhite total includes 12 percent blacks and 12 percent Hispanics. The previous highs in midterm elections were 13 percent for blacks, in 2014; and 8 percent for Hispanics, in 2006, 2012 and 2014 alike.\n\nWith black candidates in several high-profile races, voters nationally by 71-24 percent say it\u2019s important to elect more racial and ethnic minorities to public office; 44 percent say it\u2019s very important. It\u2019s very important to 61 percent of nonwhites, compared with 38 percent of whites.\n\nThere\u2019s also a sharp division \u2013 as much political as racial and ethnic \u2013 in whether voters think whites are favored over minorities, minorities are favored over whites, or no group is favored. Among Democrats, 71 percent think whites are favored over minorities. Among Republicans, just 10 percent agree.\n\nVoting: Ballot access is a related issue: In these preliminary results, the public by 54-36 percent sees voter suppression as a bigger concern than vote fraud.\n\nAge: Will young and first-time voters make a difference this year? Patterns of when people vote mean this can change, but in preliminary results 18- to 29-year-olds account for 13 percent of voters nationally today; it was 11 percent in 2014, when they backed Democrats for House by a 12-point margin.\n\nEconomy: 68 percent of voters say the economy is in excellent or good condition, up dramatically from 36 percent just two years ago, albeit far below the peak, 85 percent, in 2000. Many fewer, though, say their own financial situation has improved in the past two years: 35 percent, compared with 30 percent two years ago.\n\nWhat typically matters most is people who say they\u2019re worse off: 14 percent in today\u2019s preliminary results. It was 26 percent in 2014; what mattered is that they favored Republicans for House \u2013 then voting against the president\u2019s party \u2013 by 67-31 percent.\n\nMueller/Election Security: In the investigation still hanging over the Trump White House:\n\nVoters divide on Robert Mueller\u2019s handling of his investigation, 42-46 percent, approve-disapprove.\n\nVoters by 54-41 percent say the Mueller investigation is mostly politically motivated rather than justified.\n\nGun Ownership: 47 percent of voters live in gun-owning households in preliminary exit poll results.\n\nStricter Gun Control Measures: 60-35 percent, support-oppose. Among those in gun-owning households, 42-52 percent.\n\nVeterans: 14 percent of voters, preliminarily.\n\nWhite Evangelical Christians: 27 percent of voters, preliminarily. The previous midterm peak was 27 percent in 2014. One of the most Republican groups, they voted 83-16 percent for House candidates in 2016, and 78-21 percent in 2014.\n\nLGBT Voters: 6 percent of all voters in results so far, compared with 4 percent in the last two elections.\n\nIndependents \u2013 often swing voters \u2013 are voting 55-41 percent for Democratic vs. Republican House candidates in preliminary exit poll results. In 2016, independents backed Donald Trump by 47-41 percent, and they voted Republican by a 14-point margin in the last midterms in 2014.\n\nYoung voters (18-29) are voting 68-31 percent, Democratic-Republican. That vast 37-point margin compares with a 21-point margin for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and a 12-point margin for Democratic House candidates among under-30s in 2014.\n\nIn a continuing demographic trend, nonwhites make up 29 percent of voters today, the most on record for a midterm in exit polls since 1982.They\u2019re voting Democratic by 77-22 percent, including 69-29 percent among Hispanics, the widest Democratic margin in midterms since 2006, and 90-9 percent among blacks.\n\nSuburban women were a focus of election coverage. They\u2019re dividing 54-44 percent between Democratic and Republican House candidates. Among women overall, it\u2019s 60-39 percent.\n\nModerates backed Clinton by 13 points in 2016 and voted Democratic by a similar margin, 10 points, in 2014. Today moderates are voting 63-34 percent, Democratic-Republican, a 29-point margin in preliminary exit poll results.\n\nTwenty-seven percent of voters nationally are liberals - if it holds, a record high in any election in exit polls since 1976 (albeit by a single point from 2016). Conservative voters represent 35 percent of the electorate, compared with a midterm record of 42 percent in 2010.\n\nRepublican candidates are overwhelmingly winning voters who say they\u2019ve become better off financially under Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 but these are just 35 percent of voters. Among those whose financial situation is unchanged, the vote is 71-28 percent, Democratic-Republican.\n\nThere\u2019s been much attention paid to voters who say they\u2019re either showing support for Trump or opposition to him. Also of interest \u2013 the 33 percent who say Trump is not a factor in their vote. They\u2019re dividing 46-51 percent, Democratic-Republican.\n\nEvangelical white Christians, a GOP mainstay, are voting 22-75 percent, Democratic-Republican, in the national House vote, their typical level.\n\nClinton won college-educated white women by 10 points in 2016, and this group voted +2 points Republican in 2014. Now they\u2019re favoring Democratic House candidates by 23 points, 61-38 percent.\n\nAcross the political spectrum, non-college white men, 20 percent of voters, are going 34-65 percent, Democratic-Republican in their national House vote. That\u2019s +31 points Republican, compared with their +46 points for Trump in 2016 and +35-point Republican vote in 2014.\n\nVoters who are focused on the economy are split 35-62 percent, Democratic-Republican. Among those concerned more with health care, that goes to a 77-21 percent Democratic advantage.\n\nFurther, they\u2019re voting for Democratic rather than Republican House candidates nationally by more than 2-1, 67-32 percent, a record margin for this group in exit polls \u2013 presidential and midterms alike \u2013 in available data back to 1990.\n\nJeff Kowalsky/Reuters\n\nNorth Dakota Senate race\n\nDemocrat Heidi Heitkamp has conceded the North Dakota Senate race to Republican Kevin Cramer.\n\nForty-seven percent of voters said that Heitkamp\u2019s (D) vote against Kavanaugh was important in their vote, and they went for Cramer by nearly 2-to-1: 38-62 percent.\n\nHeitkamp won independents (38 percent of voters), but only by a 10-point margin, not enough with Republicans accounting for 40 percent of the electorate. Predictably, they voted 92-7 percent for Cramer.\n\nDonald Trump won North Dakota by a 36-point margin in 2016, 63-27 percent. His approval rating there today is 60-39 percent, the second-highest approval rating across exit poll states. Even so, 47 percent of voters said that Trump was not a factor in their vote, versus 31 percent of voters who said they\u2019re casting a ballot to support him and 20 percent who said they\u2019re voting to oppose him.\n\nHeitkamp has a 43-53 percent favorability rating -- 10 points under water -- and is seen as too liberal by 47 percent of voters. Cramer\u2019s favorability rating is better, 53-42 percent, while 40 percent see him as too conservative.\n\nWDAY\n\nMore voters in this farm state said that Trump\u2019s trade policies have hurt their local economy, 36 percent, than helped, 23 percent; 34 percent see no impact. And a majority, 52 percent, said the tax cuts have had no impact on their finances. Thirty-nine percent said they\u2019ve become better off financially since Trump took office.\n\nHealth care ranks first as the top issue (out of four). And voters divide 46-42 percent on whether the Democrats or the Republicans would better protect coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nChanges to voter ID laws raised concerns about Native American\u2019s voting access. In preliminary results, Native Americans account for 2 percent of North Dakota voters, vs. 4 percent in 2008 (the most recent exit poll data in the state).\n\nThe vote in preliminary data is 38-62 percent, Heitkamp-Cramer, among those citing Heitkamp\u2019s vote against Kavanaugh as an important factor in their decision (47 percent of voters).\n\nUnusually, more than 35 percent of North Dakota Republicans voted for Democratic candidates in the 1990s and early aughts, when Democratic candidates won by 20-point margins. Not so today. Just 7 percent of Republicans are backing Heitkamp.\n\nWomen went for the Democrat in Senate races by more than 25 points between 1992 and 2006. Today, they split 51-48 percent, Heitkamp-Cramer, while Cramer took six-in-10 men.\n\nA bright spot for Heitkamp was the 44 percent who say health care is their top priority of four -- she has a +42 advantage among them, 71-29 percent.\n\nTexas Senate race\n\nRepublican Ted Cruz is on track to win the Texas Senate race, ABC News projects, based on exit polls.\n\nJonathan Bachman/Reuters\n\nMen voted for Cruz by a 15-point margin, 42-57 percent, compared with women\u2019s 7-point margin, 53-46 percent, for O\u2019Rourke.\n\nWhite college-educated women, 13 percent of Texas voters, divided 49-49 percent O\u2019Rourke-Cruz.\n\nFifty-nine percent said Cruz\u2019s vote in favor of Kavanaugh was a factor in their vote, they broke 40-60 percent O\u2019Rourke-Cruz.\n\nNonwhites account for 41 percent of Texas voters, including 24 percent Latinos. These are highs in Texas midterms in available exit polls back to 1984, and are at or near their record levels, 43 and 24 percent, in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTexas Republicans outnumbered Democrats by 9 points in the 2016 presidential election and 12 points in the 2014 midterms. Today it\u2019s a 5-point gap, 33-38 percent, Democrats-Republicans. (The last time a Democrat won a Senate seat in Texas, in 1988, turnout was +5 Democrats over Republicans.)\n\nTexas voters divide 46-49 percent on whether they\u2019d rather see the Democrats or the Republicans control the Senate.\n\nTurnout among liberals, 21 percent, is at a new high \u2013 but there are far more conservatives, 43 percent, voting in Texas in this election.\n\nForty-two percent of voters say Beto O\u2019Rourke (D) is too liberal, vs. 38 percent who say Ted Cruz (R) is too conservative. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s favorability rating is 51-41 percent; Cruz\u2019s, 52-46 percent.\n\nThirty-three percent in the longest-border state call Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies \u201cabout right,\u201d and voters divide 48-48 percent on whether they support or oppose a wall across the entire U.S. border with Mexico. Asked the top issue in the vote, 32 percent choose immigration among four issues given, compared with 23 percent nationally.\n\nIndependents in Texas voted Republican by a 37-point margin in the 2014 midterms. They\u2019re +5 for O\u2019Rourke, 51-46 percent, in these preliminary results.\n\nVoters focused on health care \u2013 37 percent of the electorate \u2013 are voting 68-31 percent, O\u2019Rourke-Cruz. It\u2019s the 1st-ranked issue out of four in Texas. Among immigration voters, by contrast, it\u2019s 24-75 percent\n\nWhile conservatives predominate, a substantial 36 percent of Texas voters are moderates. They\u2019re voting 64-34 percent, O\u2019Rourke-Cruz.\n\nAmong the 62 percent of voters in gun households, it\u2019s 37-62 percent, a wide Cruz lead.\n\nTwenty-two percent cast a ballot for the first time in a midterm election today, the most of any of the 21 states with exit polls today. They\u2019re voting 52-45 percent, O\u2019Rourke-Cruz.\n\nThirteen percent are younger than 30, voting 71-29 percent, the largest Democratic margin among this group in available exit polls back to 1984, and surpassing their margin in the 2016 presidential election by 23 points. By contrast, seniors, 29 percent of the electorate, are voting 42-58 percent.\n\nNonwhites are voting 69-30 percent, O\u2019Rourke-Cruz. That includes Latinos, 63-35 percent \u2013 their largest Democratic margin since 2006 - and blacks, 90-9 percent.\n\nJacob Hamilton/Ann Arbor News/AP\n\nWisconsin governor's race\n\nForty-seven percent of voters prefer to keep incumbent Scott Walker\u2019s (R) signature 2011 law eliminating most collective bargaining for public employees; 41 percent would like to see it repealed. (17 percent are from union households, a new low.)\n\nTony Evers (D) is more personally popular than Walker, who\u2019s seeking his third term. Evers has a 53-41 percent favorability rating, compared with 48-51 percent for Walker \u2013 10 points higher on unfavorability.\n\nTurnout divides 35-33 percent, Democrats-Republicans, in these preliminary results. That 2-point gap is similar to the last two gubernatorial elections (+1R in 2014, +1D in 2010).\n\nIn a state that narrowly went for Trump in 2016, he has a 46-53 percent job approval rating.\n\nWhile just 16 percent of the electorate, nonwhite voters are making up their largest share of voters in available exit polls for Wisconsin gubernatorial races since 1994.\n\nWalker won independents by double-digits in his previous gubernatorial victories; in this election Evers is winning them, 54-44 percent.\n\nWalker lost moderate voters by 6 points in 2010 and 13 points in 2010. Tonight he\u2019s losing them by more, 19 points, 59-40 percent.\n\nCritics of the state\u2019s controversial collective bargaining law, 41 percent of all voters, are backing Evers over Walker by 76-22 percent. Union voters are going 59-38 percent, Evers-Walker; Walker\u2019s 21-point deficit in this group is narrower than in either 2014 (31 points) or 2010 (26 points).\n\nNon-college white men are voting broadly for Walker, 40-58 percent.\n\nWalker\u2019s favorable rating is 49 percent; Evers\u2019, 50 percent.\n\nTurnout divides 34-34 percent, Democrats-Republicans. Walker won slightly more Democrats than Evers won Republicans. But Evers comes back among independents by 7 points, 52-45 percent.\n\nEvers is buoyed by nonwhites. While just 17 percent of the electorate, they are making up their largest share of voters in available exit polls for Wisconsin gubernatorial races since 1994. Evers is winning about three-quarters of them. Walker\u2019s margin is 45-54 percent among white voters.\n\nCritics of the state\u2019s controversial collective bargaining law, 38 percent of all voters, are backing Evers over Walker by 78-19 percent. However, Walker comes back with a similar advantage among the 48 percent who support it.\n\nUnion voters are 18 percent of voters, a new low. Evers is winning them, 55-41 percent, but this 14-point deficit is narrower than Walker had in either 2014 (31 points) or 2010 (26 points).\n\nMichigan governor's race\n\nDemocrat Gretchen Whitmer is on track to win the Michigan gubernatorial race, ABC News projects, based on exit polls.\n\nWhitmer won independents, 50-45, a group which previously went for Donald Trump by 16 points and outgoing governor Rick Snyder (R) by 27 points\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton lost white women by 8 points in 2016, Whitmer won them by 14 points, 56-42. Among black women, the margin is 93-4, Whitmer-Schuette.\n\nFifty-eight percent of Michigan voters trust Gretchen Whitmer (D) to handle the state\u2019s safe-drinking water issue; just 30 percent trust Bill Schuette (R) to handle it.\n\nIn a state that narrowly went for Trump in 2016, his job approval is now 42-57, one of the lowest in the 21 states with exit polls tonight.\n\nWith Whitmer seeking to become Michigan\u2019s second female governor, 79 percent of voters say it\u2019s important for more women to be elected to public office. About 8 in 10 men and women alike say it\u2019s important.\n\nVoters in Michigan are about as likely to say Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies have hurt their local economy as to say they\u2019ve helped, 32-30 percent. And while 64 percent of voters say the national economy is in good shape, fewer, 36 percent, say they are personally better off financially since Trump took office.\n\nForty-six percent of Michigan voters named health care as the top issue facing the country\u2014more than twice as many as named the economy (20 percent) or other issues asked about. This was a winning issue for Whitmer, with those concerned about health care voting 79-19, Whitmer-Schuette.\n\nGeorgia governor's race\n\nIn preliminary exit poll results, turnout among nonwhites is a record 40 percent, including 30 percent black voters. The previous high among nonwhites was 36 percent in 2014 \u2013 compared with just 18 percent in 1994.\n\nForty-two percent of voters are conservatives, which is typical in Georgia. Liberals account for 20 percent, a new high for a gubernatorial election if it holds. It was 17 percent in 2014.\n\nThirty-nine percent say Stacey Abrams (D) is too liberal; 36 percent say Brian Kemp (R) is too conservative.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s approval rating is 51 percent among Georgia voters, 7 points better than his overall approval nationally. 20 percent say they\u2019re voting to show support for Trump; 15 percent, to oppose him.\n\nSeventy percent call it important to elect more women to public office; that compares with 78 percent nationally.\n\nThere's greater concern about voter suppression than voter fraud, 51-41 percent, a key topic in this contest.\n\nWhile the women\u2019s vote gets a lot of attention, men in Georgia are splitting about evenly, 46-49, Abrams-Kemp. In the last two gubernatorial elections for which we have exit polls (2014 and 2006), the winning Republican candidates won men by 60-37 and 61-34 percent.\n\nIndependents, historically a swing voter group in Georgia, divide 55-41 percent, Abrams-Kemp.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s suburban voters are voting 43-54 percent, Abrams-Kemp \u2013 including advantages for Kemp among suburban women (46-53 percent) and suburban men (40-54 percent) alike.\n\nLibertarian Ted Metz has 3 percent support, worth watching because Georgia requires candidates to get more than 50 percent of the vote to win an election.\n\nCollege-educated voters in Georgia are voting 55-43, Abrams-Kemp. This 12-point advantage is the largest Democratic lead in any midterm exit poll conducted in Georgia to date.\n\nIndiana Senate race\n\nJustin Casterline/EPA via Shutterstock\n\nDemocrat Joe Donnelly has conceded the Indiana Senate race to Republican Mike Braun.\n\nThe race was a test case for Kavanaugh impact: 53 percent call incumbent Donnelly\u2019s (D) vote against Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation important in their vote; 19 percent call it a minor factor, 22 percent not a factor at all. We\u2019ll see how they voted after the polls close.\n\nDonald Trump has a 52-48 percent approval rating in a state he won by 19 points in 2016. (Native son Mike Pence has a 54-43 percent favorability rating.) Thirty percent say they\u2019re voting to show support for Trump, 34 percent to oppose him, while 32 percent say he\u2019s not a factor.\n\nSeventy-three percent of Hoosier voters say the national economy is doing well but local conditions are less broadly positive. Forty-six percent say their own finances have improved since Trump took office, 36 percent say they\u2019ve benefited from the Trump tax law and 29 percent say his trade policies have helped their local economy.\n\nForty-two percent say health care is the top issue of four facing the country. And voters divide 50-44 percent on which party, the Democrats or the Republicans, would better protect pre-existing condition coverage.\n\nTrump\u2019s pushed immigration hard -- but it\u2019s the top issue to just 26 percent, far trailing health care. (The economy comes in at 21 percent.) More say that his immigration policies are too tough, 41 percent, than about right, 34 percent, or not tough enough, 21 percent.\n\nDonnelly won his seat in 2012 partly on the strength of an 11-point victory among independent voters. Independents are voting 52-40 percent between Donnelly and Mike Braun (R) in preliminary results tonight. They account for 32 percent of voters \u2013 if it holds, a new high in available exit poll data.\n\nDonnelly ran evenly among men in 2012. Today they\u2019re voting 42-54 percent, Donnelly-Braun.\n\nSuburban voters divide 48-49 percent, Donnelly-Braun. Donnelly won suburbanites by a scant 2 points in 2012; in 2016, fellow Democrat Evan Bayh lost suburbanites by 17 points and lost the race. Suburban women are voting 52-43 percent, compared with suburban men, 43-54 percent.\n\nHealth care/immigration showdown: The vote is 74-22 percent Donnelly-Braun among those who picked health care as the top issue of four; that compares with 11-84 percent among the 26 percent who picked immigration as the top issue.\n\nThose who call Donnelly\u2019s vote against Kavanaugh highly important divide by 41-54 percent, Donnelly-Braun.\n\nLibertarian Lucy Brenton has 4 percent of the vote, compared with 6 percent for Libertarian Andy Horning in 2012. Indiana Democrats ran ads highlighting Brenton\u2019s policy positions during the campaign, seeking to draw conservative votes her way.\n\nJohn Locher/AP\n\nOhio governor's race\n\nRepublican Mike DeWine is on track to win the Ohio gubernatorial race, ABC News projects, based on exit polls.\n\nDonald Trump has a split-decision 49-49 percent job approval rating among Ohio voters today, in a state he won by 8 points in 2016. Those who strongly disapprove of Trump outnumber those who strongly approve by 7 points, 43-36 percent.\n\nDemocrats were outnumbered by Republicans among Ohio voters by 3 points in 2016, 34-37 percent, and it\u2019s the same gap again today, 35-38 percent.\n\nConservatives accounted for a plurality of Ohio voters, 43 percent, in the 2014 gubernatorial race and 39 percent two years ago. Today, in data so far, they account for fewer voters, 37 percent.\n\nThe national economy is well-rated \u2013 73 percent in Ohio say it\u2019s in excellent or good shape, up dramatically from 34 percent in 2016 \u2013 but far fewer say Trump\u2019s trade policies have helped their local economy (30 percent) or say his tax law has helped their own finances (28 percent).\n\nOhio voters pick health care as the top issue facing the country out of four choices offered; 41 percent choose it, far above the other choices. In a health-related issue \u2013 one that played prominently in the campaign \u2013 there\u2019s vast concern about the government response to the opioid crisis \u2013 28 percent approve, 61 percent disapprove.\n\nIndependents \u2013 often swing voters in this swing state \u2013 favored Trump over Hillary Clinton by 14 points in the presidential race two years ago. In the gubernatorial election today they\u2019re splitting 50-46 percent, Cordray-DeWine.\n\nWomen \u2013 who favored Clinton in Ohio by a scant 3 points in Ohio in 2016 - are backing Cordray by 58-41 percent over DeWine.\n\nNon-college white men, a GOP mainstay, are backing DeWine by a wide margin, 34-63 percent, Cordray-DeWine.\n\nDeWine is +5 points among Suburban voters, 47-52 percent, Cordray-DeWine (no longer \"dividing evenly\"). That includes a wide gender gap, suburban men 40-58 percent; suburban women 54-46 percent. SIZEPLC3, SEX\n\nIn a race that focused heavily on the opioid crisis, voters who disapprove of the way the government is handling the issue favor Cordray by 57-39 percent.\n\nUnion households, while historically a Democratic group, voted for Trump by 13 points in 2016, 54-41. Tonight, representing 26 percent of voters, they are voting 52-42 percent, Cordray-DeWine.\n\nWest Virginia Senate race\n\nJoshua Roberts/Reuters\n\nDemocrat Joe Manchin is on track to win the West Virginia Senate race, ABC News projects, based on exit polls.\n\nWest Virginia voted 69-26 percent for Trump in 2016, his best state; today voters there give him a 63-34 percent job approval rating \u2013 his best approval rating in any of the 21 states where exit polls are being conducted.\n\nIn terms of basic popularity: Joe Manchin\u2019s (D) favorability rating is 49-47 percent. Patrick Morrisey\u2019s (R) is a weaker 40-55 percent, 15 points under water. It could matter, since 25 percent say they\u2019re looking chiefly for the candidate who \u201ccares about people like me.\u201d\n\nDemocrats\u2019 share of the West Virginia electorate has dived from 57 percent in 1996 to 32 percent now, a new low. Turnout by independents has grown \u2013 from 14 percent in 1996 to 31 percent today, a new high. Manchin won independents by 7 points in 2010, a key to his victory.\n\nManchin was the only Democratic senator to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. 40 percent of voters say Manchin\u2019s vote was a key factor in their Senate vote. Twenty-two percent call it a minor factor; 34 percent, not a factor at all.\n\nAmong the state\u2019s voters overall, 40 percent say Trump\u2019s trade policies have helped their local economy (22 percent hurt, 33 percent no impact).\n\nManchin slammed Morrisey for joining a lawsuit to repeal Obamacare and limit coverage for pre-existing conditions. Today 40 percent call health care the top issue (of four) in their vote, and voters divide 41-51 percent on which party, the Democrats or the Republicans, would better protect coverage for pre-existing conditions.\n\nManchin won independents by 7 points in 2010. He\u2019s running even with them, 47-47 percent, in today\u2019s preliminary results.\n\nAmong voters who call Manchin\u2019s vote for Kavanaugh a factor in their vote today, Manchin leads Morrisey by 53-44 percent.\n\nThere\u2019s a wide gender gap, with a broad advantage for Morrisey among men, 40-57 percent, Manchin-Morrisey.\n\nForty percent say they\u2019re looking for the candidate who \u201cshares my view of government,\u201d the top candidate attribute, and Morrisey is winning them, 30-68 percent, Manchin-Morrisey.\n\nModerates. Manchin got hammered among conservatives in 2010 but won political moderates by 39 points. He\u2019s winning them by a narrower margin, 26 points (61-35 percent) in preliminary results tonight.\n\nFlorida governor's race\n\nDemocrat Andrew Gillum has conceded the gubernatorial race to Republican Ron DeSantis.\n\nForty-four percent of Florida voters say Gillum (D) is too liberal, while 37 percent say DeSantis (R) is too conservative.\n\nLiberals account for 22 percent of voters, matching their high in governor\u2019s races in the state. Many more, 39 percent, are conservatives.\n\nDonald Trump won Florida with 48 percent of the vote in 2017. He\u2019s got a 51-48 percent approval rating now. Voters reject impeachment, which Gillum has supported, by 54-40 percent.\n\nNonwhites account for 34 percent of voters in the state, including 15 percent Hispanics and 13 percent blacks. That\u2019s a new high for midterm elections in the state, albeit short of its 2016 record, 38 percent. While much attention is paid to the Republican-leaning Cuban-American vote, 67 percent of Hispanic voters in this election are not Cuban.\n\nRick Scott (R) won Florida\u2019s suburban voters by 4 points in 2010 and 8 points in 2014. Today, they\u2019re +6 Republican, 46-52 percent, Gillum-DeSantis, with a wide gender gap: 53-46 percent among suburban women, 39-61 percent among suburban men.\n\nIndependents, who voted for Charlie Crist (D) by a 2-point margin in his narrow 2014 loss, are now +11 points Democratic, 54-43 percent, Gillum-DeSantis. They make up 30 percent of voters today, slightly below their share in 2014, 33 percent.\n\nTrump approvers overall are backing the president\u2019s ally DeSantis, 8-90 percent, but among those who only \u201csomewhat\u201d approve of him, 14 percent of all voters, the vote is 28-65 percent, Gillum-DeSantis.\n\nHispanics backed Gillum by 58-39 percent and blacks by 86-14 percent, similar to their vote in 2014.\n\nFlorida Senate race\n\nMinority voters may be key in Florida; they account for 34 percent of voters in the state, up sharply from a low of 15 percent in 1992 but less than the 38 percent who came out in 2016. That includes 15 percent Hispanics and 13 percent blacks. Among Hispanics, 32 percent are of Cuban origin, while 24 percent are Puerto Rican, following an influx from the island post-Hurricane Maria.\n\nForty percent say health care is the most important issue of the four asked, 29 percent immigration, 16 percent the economy and 11 percent gun policy. Voters give the Democrats an edge in trust to protect coverage for pre-existing conditions, 48-38 percent.\n\nSixty-seven percent of Florida voters call climate change a serious problem and say the government should do more to protect the environment, an issue used against both candidates after massive algae blooms.\n\nRick Scott (R) has a 46-50 percent favorability rating among voters, compared with incumbent Bill Nelson\u2019s (D) 50-43 percent favorability. Another consideration: Florida voters divide 50-46 percent on whether they\u2019d like to see the Democrats or the Republicans control the Senate.\n\nOn the Kavanaugh-effect front, 38 percent call Nelson\u2019s vote against confirmation a top factor in their vote; 17 percent call it a minor factor \u2013 and 39 percent, not a factor at all.\n\nBattle of the \u2018burbs? Nelson has won the populous Florida suburbs by double-digit margins in each of his past Senate races. Scott won them by 4 points in 2010 and 8 points in 2014. It\u2019s 46-52 percent, Nelson-Scott. That includes a 52-46 vote among suburban women, vs. 40-59 percent among suburban men.\n\nScott\u2019s win in the 2014 governor\u2019s race came via a 21-point advantage among whites. Whites tonight are voting for Scott by 19 points, 40-59 percent.\n\nThose who think the government should do more to protect the environment are favoring Nelson by a 2-1 margin, 66-34 percent.\n\nHealth care is the top-cited issue in the state, and it\u2019s a 75-22 percent vote in for Nelson\u2019s favor among those with cited it. Among immigration voters, on the other hand, it\u2019s 17-83 percent, Nelson-Scott.\n\nNelson's margin is +11 among Hispanics, underperforming his best (+22) and Clinton\u2019s performance in 2016 (+27) alike.\n\nThose who call Nelson\u2019s anti-Kavanaugh vote a top factor divide 47-52 percent, Nelson-Scott.\n\nNelson is underperforming in the Tampa Bay area (16 percent of voters) compared with his 2012 run \u2013 he\u2019s down 8 points there now, 44-52 percent, vs. 52-41 in 2012. (They split in 2016, 47-46 Clinton-Trump.)\n\nNelson lost men, 42-58 percent, but didn\u2019t improve much on his margin among women from 2012, 56-42 percent now vs. 59-39 percent then.\n\nScott\u2019s improved his margin among Hispanics, winning 44 percent of them now vs. 38 percent in 2014. Nelson\u2019s 55 percent is slightly down from 59 percent in 2012.\n\nNelson is losing suburban voters by 4 points (48-52 percent), when he won them in 2012 by 14 points. By contrast, Scott did better among small city and rural voters than he did in 2014, netting 65 percent of their votes tonight vs. 57 percent then.\n\nTwo-thirds of Florida voters say that the economy is excellent or good, and they favor Scott by 41-59 percent, Nelson-Scott.\n\nHealth care-focused voters, 40 percent, favored Nelson by a +52 margin \u2013 but immigration and economy-focused voters (together, a larger 45 percent) swung just as hard for Scott.\n\nMissouri Senate race\n\nRepublican Josh Hawley is on track to win the Missouri Senate race, ABC News projects, based on exit polls.\n\nJosh Hawley\u2019s (R) victory is thanks to a large advantage in small cities and rural areas, 30-68 percent Claire McCaskill-Hawley, and a narrow advantage in the suburbs, 48-51 percent.\n\nHawley\u2019s also winning men, 46-53 percent, McCaskill-Hawley. In McCaskill\u2019s last race (2012), she won men by eight points, 51-43 percent.\n\nAnd, independents are dividing about evenly, 49-48 percent. McCaskill had won this typically swing group by 12- and 8-point margins in 2012 and 2006.\n\nMcCaskill\u2019s (D) narrow first election in 2006 relied on her 6-point margin among women, as well as the fact that they accounted for 55 percent of voters in the state. Women make up 52 percent of Missouri voters in preliminary exit poll results tonight.\n\nAlso to watch: a conservative turnout. Conservatives accounted 37 percent of voters in 2006 when McCaskill first was elected and to 42 percent two years ago. They\u2019re back down to 36 percent of voters in results so far tonight.\n\nTrump\u2019s approval rating is an even 50-49 percent in a state he won by 19 points in 2016. Thirty-one percent say they\u2019re voting to express support for Trump, 35 percent to oppose him. That said, in a threat for McCaskill, Missouri voters divide 45-50 percent on whether they want the Democrats or the Republicans in control of the Senate.\n\nForty-five percent think McCaskill\u2019s positions on the issues are too liberal, while 42 percent think Josh Hawley\u2019s (R) are too conservative.\n\nAfter two terms in office McCaskill has a 47-51 percent favorability rating; Hawley, 48-49 percent. While favorability doesn\u2019t differentiate them, views on their ethics do: 50 percent say McCaskill has high ethical standards, while 39 percent say Hawley does.\n\nHealth care dominates as the top issue of four offered \u2013 48 percent call it the most important of four offered; the economy and immigration tie for second with 20 percent each. Missouri voters pick the Democrats over the Republicans to better protect health care for those with pre-existing conditions, 52-44 percent.\n\nFifty-one percent of voters say McCaskill\u2019s vote against Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation was a top factor in their Senate vote. Seventeen percent say it was a minor factor; 27 percent, not a factor at all.\n\nTurnout among independents is 32 percent in preliminary exit poll results, potentially a new high in midterms, while Democrats and Republicans are at 34 percent of the electorate apiece. With Republican and Democrat voter turnout even, McCaskill likely needs independents to hold her seat.\n\nIndependents are voting a close 49-47 percent, McCaskill-Hawley, in preliminary exit poll results. McCaskill won this typically swing group by 12- and 8-point margins in 2012 and 2006.\n\nSuburban voters backed McCaskill by 55-39 percent in her easy 2012 race against Todd Akin (R), but she lost them, 46-52 percent, in 2006. They\u2019re voting by the same 46-52 percent in preliminary results today. That includes a gender gap, 49-50 percent among suburban women, 44-55 percent among suburban men.\n\nThose who call McCaskill\u2019s vote against Kavanaugh a top factor are voting 46-52 percent, McCaskill-Hawley. At the same time, 83 percent call sexual harassment a serious problem; they\u2019re breaking 58-42 percent in McCaskill\u2019s favor.\n\nUnusually for a Democrat, McCaskill won 35 percent of evangelical white Christians six years ago, vs. 24 percent in her close first election. Today they\u2019re dividing 27-72 percent, McCaskill-Hawley.\n\nYoung voters (age under 30) account for 10 percent of voters in Missouri in preliminary results. They\u2019re voting 63-34 percent for the Democrat \u2013 compared with 69-25 percent in her last race.\n\nTennessee Senate race\n\nMark Humphrey/AP\n\nRepublican Marsha Blackburn is on track to win the Tennessee Senate race, ABC News projects, based on exit polls.\n\nTennessee voters want the Senate controlled by the Republican Party, not the Democrats, by a broad 38-56 percent. It\u2019s one of the top three states to favor Republican control (alongside Mississippi and North Dakota).\n\nBoth Tennessee Senate candidates are relatively popular: Phil Bredesen (D) has a 51-43 percent favorability rating; Marsha Blackburn (R), 55-41 percent. Then there\u2019s Donald Trump, with a 57-40 percent approval rating among Tennessee voters, considerably better than his 44-55 percent figure nationally.\n\nTrump visited Tennessee for Blackburn as recently as this past weekend. Could help her: 37 percent say they\u2019re casting their vote to show support for Trump, vs. 27 percent voting to show opposition to Trump. Thirty-four percent say Trump\u2019s not a factor.\n\nBredesen, a former health care executive, has focused on health care; Blackburn on immigration policy. Among voters today, 38 percent call health care the top issue of four offered; 24 percent say it\u2019s immigration, 23 percent the economy. Trump\u2019s tough stance on immigration gets mixed reviews; 37 percent say it\u2019s too tough, 31 percent about right - and 27 percent not tough enough.\n\nThirty-eight percent of voters say Blackburn\u2019s too conservative; 42 percent say Bredesen is too liberal.\n\nIn terms of the candidate attributes they care about, someone who shares my view of government tops the list, 37 percent.\n\nRepublicans account for 44 percent of voters so far today \u2013 more than either Democrats (26 percent) or independents (30 percent).\n\nIndependents, potential swing voters in Tennessee, are voting 56-44 percent, Bredesen-Blackburn.\n\nBlackburn\u2019s running competitively among women overall, with 52 percent support to Bredesen\u2019s 48 percent. That includes a 41-59 percent result, Bredesen-Blackburn, among suburban women.\n\nBredesen\u2019s found votes in his focus on health care; among those who call it their top issue, he leads Blackburn by 72-28 percent. Then again, those calling immigration the top issue vote 18-82 percent, with Blackburn ahead, in preliminary results.\n\nSixteen percent voted for the first time in a midterm election, voting 57-43 percent Bredesen-Blackburn.\n\nMississippi Senate race\n\nIf Mike Espy (D) gets into a runoff, his life won\u2019t be easy: in a hypothetical head-to-head, voters divide 41-51 percent between Espy and incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith (R).\n\nNonwhites account for 36 percent of voters in Mississippi, including 31 percent blacks. Black turnout is up by 8 points from its low of 23 percent in 1988, though off its peak of 35 percent in 2012.\n\nConservatives typically dominate in Mississippi. In preliminary results today, they\u2019re at 51 percent of the electorate, the most of any state with exit polls this election.\n\nDonald Trump is popular in MS, with a 61-38 percent approval rating, and 40 percent say they\u2019re casting their ballot to show support for Trump. Both are among the highest of any state in the 21 where we have exit polls.\n\nWith Hyde-Smith the only woman among the four most prominent candidates, voters by 75-24 percent say it's important that more women be elected to public office.\n\nDemonstrating racial divides, 65 percent of black voters in Mississippi say whites are favored over minorities in the United States today. Seventeen percent of white voters agree.\n\nIn terms of top issues, 40 percent pick health care of four offered, 24 percent the economy, 23 percent immigration and 10 percent gun policy, similar to national results.\n\nAmong those casting their ballots to show support for Trump, Hyde-Smith has 59 percent support, compared with Chris McDaniel\u2019s (R) 36 percent. Trump endorsed Hyde-Smith.\n\nWomen are dividing 46-34-17 percent for Espy, Hyde-Smith, and McDaniel.\n\nAmong voters focused on health care, Espy leads Hyde-Smith 59-26 percent. Among those focused on the economy, it\u2019s 30-56 percent, Espy-Hyde-Smith.\n\nNew Jersey Senate race\n\nBryan Anselm/New York Times via Redux\n\nBob Menedez is on track to win the New Jersey Senate race, ABC News projects, based on exit polls.\n\nBob Menendez\u2019s (D) victory is largely thanks to the 55 percent of New Jerseyans who want to see control of the Senate flipped \u2013 highest among the 18 states where it was asked on exit polls tonight. Among this group, voters overwhelmingly chose Menendez over Bob Hugin (R), 93-6 percent.\n\nAdditionally, among the 60 percent who disapprove of Trump\u2019s job performance, Menendez beat Hugin by 83-14 percent.\n\nMenendez (D) is broadly unpopular, with a 33-63 percent favorability rating. Bob Hugin (R) is underwater in favorability as well, but not so broadly, 42-52 percent.\n\nRelatedly, just 27 percent say Menendez has high ethical standards. Twice as many say Hugin has high ethical standards, 45 percent. 33 percent of voters say neither has high ethical standards.\n\nHelpfully for Menendez, given those challenges, New Jersey voters say they want to see the Democrats win control of the Senate, 58-39 percent. Independents divide 59-36 percent on the question.\n\nDonald Trump has a 41-59 percent approval rating in the state, among his worst in the 21 states with exit polls tonight. Forty-seven percent say he should be impeached, more than the 41 percent who say the same nationally.\n\nMenendez lost whites by 10 points in 2012 but was elected on vast support from nonwhites. They accounted for a record 33 percent of voters then. Nonwhites make up 37 percent of voters in the state today, in preliminary results \u2013 a new high if it holds.\n\nMenendez benefits from representing a solid blue state; Democrats account for 43 percent of voters there in today\u2019s preliminary results, Republicans just 26 percent. Hugin needs independents to swing it. They account for 31 percent of voters in preliminary data.\n\nMenendez is losing those who see him unfavorably by 35-62 percent. He\u2019s also losing those who think he lacks high ethical standards, but he does win 44 percent of their votes nonetheless.\n\nMenendez ran evenly among independents in his first election in 2012. Today, independents are backing him over Hugin by 6 points, 51-45 percent, in preliminary exit poll results.\n\nArizona Senate race\n\nArizona voters prefer Republican over Democratic control of the Senate, 53-42 percent on whether they\u2019d like the Democrats or the Republicans to control the Senate, a potential boost to Martha McSally (R) vs. Kyrsten Sinema (D).\n\nThirty-two percent in this border state cite immigration as the top issue of four facing the country, compared with 23 percent nationally. Still, more pick health care (41 percent) as most important. Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies are seen as \u201cabout right\u201d by 41 percent, vs. too tough (35 percent) or not tough enough (17 percent). Nationally, his policies are seen as \u201cabout right\u201d by fewer, 32 percent.\n\nConservatives can dominate in this state, but their share of the electorate fluctuates -- 41 percent two years ago, down from a high of 46 percent in 2010. Conservatives again account for 41 percent of voters in preliminary exit poll results tonight. Liberals -- who turned out at a record 27 percent of voters in the state in 2016 -- make up 22 percent in preliminary results today.\n\nForty percent in the state say Sinema is too liberal, while 38 percent say McSally is too conservative.\n\nTrump has a 52-47 percent approval rating in the state, which he won by 4 points in 2016. Twenty-six percent say they\u2019re voting to express support for Trump, 28 percent to express opposition, while 44 percent say he\u2019s not a factor.\n\nFor all the \u201creferendum on Trump\u201d angles, there\u2019s another group to watch \u2013 the 44 percent of Arizona voters who say Trump is not a factor in their vote. They\u2019re breaking 42-58 percent, Sinema-McSally.\n\nMcSally\u2019s overwhelmingly is winning voters focused on the issue of immigration, 16-84 percent, Sinema-McSally. Those focused on health care, by comparison, are voting 77-22 percent.\n\nIndependents account for 30 percent of Arizona voters so far tonight; in 2012 Jeff Flake (R) ran essentially evenly in this group (-1 point) to win this Senate seat. Today, independents are dividing evenly, 49-49 percent.\n\nVeterans -- 14 percent of the electorate -- go broadly for McSally, 37-61 percent, Sinema-McSally.\n\nKyrsten Sinema (D) is helped by a 27-point margin among moderates (63-36 percent, Sinema-McSally) -- the largest pro-Democratic candidate margin in an Arizona Senate race in exit poll data dating back to 1994. (The next largest was 16 points in 2012.)\n\nMartha McSally (R) strikes back by winning the 44 percent who say Donald Trump isn\u2019t a factor in their vote, 42-58 percent, McSally-Sinema.\n\nVoters 65 and older (29 percent of Arizona voters) split dead even: 50-50 percent, Sinema-McSally.\n\nMontana Senate race\n\nFor all his visits, 54 percent of voters say Donald Trump is not a factor in how they cast their ballot for Senate -- more in any other state in which the question was asked. Tester is winning big among those voters, 57-41 percent. Still just 26 percent say they\u2019re voting to show support for Trump -- and 19 percent to oppose him -- leaving 54 percent saying the president, for all his visits, is not a factor.\n\nVoters are more apt to say they\u2019d like to see the Republicans than the Democrats control the Senate, 50-42 percent.\n\nIncumbent Jon Tester (D) has a 49-48 percent favorability rating, compared with Matt Rosendale\u2019s (R) weaker 41-53 percent. At the same time, 47 percent say Tester is too liberal, while 41 percent say Rosendale is too conservative.\n\nIndependents predominated in Montana when Tester won his seat in 2012, accounting for 41 percent of voters. In today\u2019s results they\u2019re 45 percent of the electorate, maintaining their central importance in the outcome. (Republicans are 29 percent of voters; Democrats, 26 percent.)\n\nForty-five percent say Tester\u2019s vote against Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation is an important factor in their vote; 53 percent of women say so, vs. 37 percent of men.\n\nTester is winning women by 19 points, 58-39 percent, double his +9 margin among women in 2012. He won white women by 6 points in 2012; his margin among white women tonight is nearly three times as large, 58-39 percent.\n\nVoters chiefly are looking for a candidate who \u201cshares my view of government\u201d -- 57 percent say so, more than twice as many as say they care most about a candidate who \u201ccares about people like me\u201d -- 24 percent.\n\nForty-six percent of voters name health care as the top issues facing the country, among four choices. The economy and immigration trail (24 percent and 21 percent).\n\nThe 54 percent of voters who say Trump was not a factor in their vote are dividing 57-41 percent, Tester-Rosendale.\n\nThose who say Tester\u2019s opposition to Kavanaugh was an important factor in their vote divide 31-66 percent, Tester-Rosendale.\n\nTester won independents by 10 points six years ago. It\u2019s a similar 52-43 percent, Tester-Rosendale, now.\n\nTester is winning big among moderates, 70-26 percent; they account for nearly four in 10 Montana voters (38 percent). This 44-point margin is even larger than the 32 points by which Tester won moderates in 2012.\n\nTester lost men by 4 points while winning women by 9 points in 2012. Today he\u2019s losing men by 8 points, 46-52 percent.\n\nNonwhites account for 12 percent of Montana voters in these preliminary results. And, while Tester won them by a whopping 42 points in 2012, today they are dividing 49-50 percent, Tester-Rosendale.\n\nTester is winning the under 30 voters by a massive 43 points, 70-27 percent, compared with the 8-point margin he won them by in 2012.\n\nEighty-one percent of Montana voters live in a gun-owning household \u2013 more than in any of the 10 states where the question was asked. And a big number. They\u2019re voting 52-46 percent for Tester over Rosendale.\n\nNevada Senate race\n\nForty-four percent call Jacky Rosen (D) too liberal; 39 percent call Incumbent Dean Heller (R) Heller too conservative.\n\nFifty-seven percent call Heller\u2019s vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh a top factor in their vote, about equal numbers of men and women alike.\n\nHeller is the only incumbent Republican senator running in a state Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Voters today divide 49-51 percent on Trump\u2019s job performance. While 34 percent say they\u2019re voting to show support for Trump, 38 percent who are voting to oppose him.\n\nVoters divide 48-47 percent in these preliminary results on whether they want the Democrats or the Republicans to control the Senate.\n\nWhites account for 62 percent of Nevada voters in preliminary results, nonwhites 38 percent \u2013 a record for nonwhites in midterms in the state. That includes 18 percent turnout by Latino voters \u2013 also, if it holds, a new midterm high.\n\nTwenty-three percent of voters are from union households, up 4 points from 2016.\n\nToday in preliminary results the electorate is 34-37 percent, Democrat-Republican. Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 8 points in 2016 and by 9 points in 2012, when Heller won his seat.\n\nHeller lost women by 6 points in 2012, while winning men by 10. He\u2019s losing women by 23 points today, 59-36 percent, Rosen-Heller.\n\nIndependents are voting 58-35 percent, Rosen-Heller \u2013 a group Heller won by 20 points in 2012.\n\nVoters who say Heller\u2019s pro-Kavanaugh vote is a top concern are dividing 49-49 percent, Rosen-Heller.\n\nHeller won in 2012 by winning by 32 points in rural counties; he\u2019s +40 points in preliminary results today.\n\nThis is a developing story.

This allows police to create a much larger family tree than using regular law enforcement databases like CODIS, in which an exact match is needed in most states, according to experts. In the case of Holmes, one person in his family who was interested in family history and genealogy entered into the GEDmatch database in the hopes of finding additional relatives she didn\u2019t know about, according to Orlando police.\n\nAuthorities have identified suspects in over a dozen crimes across the country this year thanks to genetic genealogy, including the April arrest of the suspected \"Golden State Killer,\" Joseph James DeAngelo, -- a cold case that stumped California law enforcement for decades.\n\nIn the case of Christine Franke, some of Holmes' family members had submitted their own DNA to the GEDMatch database when using DNA testing websites, police said, which allows authorities to access the information. Investigators also went to several of Holmes' family members who voluntarily gave them samples, police said.\n\nEventually Holmes was served with search warrant for his DNA which was determined to be a match to the crime scene DNA, police said.\n\nIt appears Holmes and Christine Franke did not know each other prior to the crime, police said.\n\nWFTV\n\nHolmes, 38, of Orlando, was taken into custody Friday, charged with first-degree murder with a firearm and robbery with a firearm, according to records.\n\nWhen arrested Holmes \"denied having any knowledge or being near the crime scene,\" according to police.\n\nHe has not yet entered a plea.\n\nHis public defender, Chelsea Simmons, declined to comment to ABC News.\n\nMeanwhile, Christine Franke's mother told reporters Monday that she hopes genetic genealogy technology helps more families.\n\n\"It's a terrible thing, not knowing,\" she said.", "A Washington police officer's decision to work late on Halloween helped him save a baby girl's life.\n\nDustin Johnson of the Tukwila Police Department was at the end of his shift when he and other officers responded to a 911 call.

With a total of 1,661 Democratic House and Senate candidates and 1,471 Republican candidates, so far, a total of $1.26 billion has come from the Democratic side and a little shy of $890 million has come from the Republican side.\n\nMore than $1.3 billion in outside spending has come from more than 3,200 outside groups, including party committees, super PACs and political nonprofits, marking a 60 percent increase from 2014.\n\nAP\n\nMost expensive races\n\nTop Senate races:\n\nFlorida Senate: $181 million ($91 million from candidate campaigns, $90 million from outside groups)\n\nMissouri Senate: $119 million ($42 million from candidate campaigns, $77 million from outside groups)\n\nTexas Senate: $107 million ($94 million from candidate campaigns, $14 million from outside groups)\n\nIndiana Senate: $104 million ($36 million from candidate campaigns, $68 million from outside groups)\n\nArizona Senate: $104 million ($38 million from candidate campaigns, $66 million from outside groups)\n\nIn Florida, the Senate race between Democrat Bill Nelson and Republican Rick Scott has brought in more than $181 million. More than $91 million of that has come from the two candidates, with challenger Scott outspending Nelson by more than $40 million. The Democratic leadership has jumped in to back Nelson, with major Democratic outside groups spending more than $53 million in support of Nelson and against Scott. Meanwhile, New Republican PAC, a super PAC almost exclusively dedicated to supporting Scott has spent more than $29.5 million against Nelson.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Claire McCaskill's vulnerable seat in Missouri has brought in more than $76 million from outside groups to the Missouri Senate race. Conservative groups led by Senate Leadership Fund, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and Americans for Prosperity, have spent more than $41 million in support of Hawley, while liberal groups have spent more than $35 million in support of McCaskill. Meanwhile, incumbent McCaskill's campaign has outspent Hawley by far, with the vulnerable Democrat spending more than $33 million and the Republican challenger spending $7 million.\n\nAP|Getty Images\n\nTop House races:\n\nCalifornia's 39th District: $34.5 million ($21 million from candidate campaigns, $14 million from outside groups)\n\nCalifornia's 48th District: $33 million ($13 million from candidate campaigns, $20 million from outside groups)\n\nWashington's 8th District: $30 million ($11 million from candidate campaigns, $19 million from outside groups)\n\nNew York's 19th District: $29 million ($15 million from candidate campaigns, $13.5 million from outside groups)\n\nPennsylvania's 1st District: $29 million ($15 million from candidate campaigns, $13.5 million from outside groups)\n\nIn the lower chamber, a toss-up between two minority candidates in California's 39th Congressional District, where immigrants make up a third of the population, has brought in the most money.

Kim has a strong backing of House GOP leadership though, with its super PAC Congressional Leadership PAC boasting a $6.3 million in support of Kim. House Democratic leadership is also behind Cisneros, with House Majority PAC and DCCC spending more than $5.2 million in the race.\n\nGOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher's effort to defend his seat in California's 48th district has also become increasingly expensive, with candidate campaigns spending nearly $13 million and outside groups pouring in nearly $20 million. The Democratic side is eager to unseat the vulnerable Republican, with challenger Harley Rouda leading an aggressive $6 million campaign, and liberal outside groups including Independence USA PAC, House Majority PAC and DCCC spending more than $11 million to back him.

Please welcome one of our favorites, Kenan Thompson. ?????? Woo! Welcome to the show. You love you some Kenan. I was once your intern. So back one day in college I interned at \"Snl,\" and you were always so lovely. Thank you. So good to see you again. I'm sad that I have to ask you a hard question right now, so the hot topic was about your colleague, Pete Davidson making a joke about Dan crenshaw who is a veteran who lost his eye serving in our country in Afghanistan after he had his eye injure. He within the back for another deployment. Dan says he doesn't need an apology, but not everyone feels that way. I know you have been asked about this before. I know you didn't make the joke, but is \"Snl\" going to do anything to that end? I'm sure they are. I mean, I know it's being handled internally. It's not necessarily my department, but since I'm out promoting \"The grinch,\" I get to answer these questions. Yesterday is never somewhere I would go in the offense territory towards veterans because my father is one. Your father is one. Great man. I met him when he hosted. So it's been an unfortunate outcome when you go for jokes and you figure out a way to get into something that's a touchy subject or something that is very sorrowful and you want to try to bring joy into something and you miss the mark or whatever like I said. That's right. That's what I thought where he was coming from. Pete's a good kid. He has a big heart. He has tragedy in his heart with his father passing on 9/11 being a firefighter. I don't think he goes out to offend people, but that's what happens in this case. So they are figuring out a way to right that wrong I'm pretty sure. It's not our intention to disrespect anyone. Our whole thing is just to be artists and hold up the mirror, you know what I mean? And laugh. \"Saturday night live,\" they don't normally take any prisoners. It's satire. It makes the news. I was doing whoopi because there is a whoopi. That's all it is. Do you miss me? I do, yes. We passed the torch to Leslie. It makes me sad. Did you give her any tips now that she has playing her? I told her to do it the complete opposite because whoopi hates mine. She loves me, but hates my impression. I got to get better glasses than this. Why did you hate the impression? I never hated the impression. What happened to him? He graduated. That's it for me, I guess. Can you still do a whoopi impression? Oh, absolutely, child. Let's hear it. Can I borrow your glasses? Now that guy in the white house -- I don't even want to say his name or whatever, but we're not here to talk about whatever.

He is not only the fonz, but one of the greatest human beings, like, walking the planet. He is, like, the nicest guy. When I first met him and we worked on a cartoon together, he embraced me like he knew me for 100 years. He don't have to talk to me. He could be, like, hi, and keep it professional or whatever, but he didn't do that. He was very warm and he is open. Like, we watch you all the time and I love you so much. Henry Winkler, are you kidding? You know we all love you, you know? He waited 42 years to win that thing. Hey, man. If I have to wait any less than that, I'll be happy. So I was happy to see him be recognized for how great he is on screen and off. That's a classy response. We have all watched you, though, for years. \"Good burger\" is one of my favorite movies of all-time. That's where it's at. Thank you very much. You're here for more than one reason. That's fabulous. The holidays are almost here and it's time for holiday movies and you're in the remake of the classic Dr. Seuss story, \"The grinch.\" Let's take a look. Yes, please. Have you heard? The mayor wants Christmas to be three times bigger this year. That means three times the lights, three times the eggnog. Information needed. That's a good one. This is one of your kidding things. Finally. Something you said is really funny. Yeah, I do kid a lot, but no. This is actually -- you're going to have a good time with this, aren't you? I got to say, it's really nice to see you laughing. Who plays \"The grinch\"? Benedict Cumberbatch. That's him? Yeah. I love him. You're such a jolly character, and bricklebaum, how did you bring him to life? Just look at him. They showed me the picture and I was, like, he is just a big ball of joy, a big ball of Christmas joy. That sweater, that beard. Just made that voice pop in my head. He tries to be the friend of \"The grinch.\" He wants to be his best friend. He is not taking pit. For awhile, and then it happens, and it's a tearful moment for him. It finally actually happened. I made my best friend out of, like, the worst dude ever, and everybody loves a good redemption story. I'm excited to be part of it. It's great. I saw it with my children. I'm glad you enjoyed it. My kids enjoyed it. They are 12 and 16. You have a new baby. Second baby. Yeah. 3 months. You're doing something they can see. My big girl, she is 4, she will see it. We went to an unveiling of Bloomingdale's yesterday, and they have a picture, and she was there, and the baby was there of course, but she can't talkyet. They did the countdown and it was just -- it warmed my heart to see her counting down with everybody. She is so involved in life now, you know what I mean? It's amazing. They turn 4 and then they're people. They turn into people. It's freaky. It's beautiful, yeah. Really sweet. So, pop, come back any time. We love having you here. Do I have to leave now? Because I want to stay here. I'm afraid so. We continue want to really let go of Kenan. You can stay I think. I'll just do the outro and don't go anywhere. He'll be here on \"Snl\" Saturday nights and \"The grinch\" hits theaters on November 9th and\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "The top Google trend search on the morning of the 2018 midterm elections was \"Donde votar,\" Spanish for \"Where to vote,\" providing further evidence that the Latino vote is becoming more of a deciding force in electing political leaders.\n\nInterested in Midterm Elections?

More than 36 million people have already cast early ballots and here to break down how much is at stake, please welcome one of the really great people here at ABC, he is the ABC news chief white house correspondent, but we just know him as Jonathan Karl. What's up? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So what do you make of all of this? The guy in the white house has been making some controversial comments saying he is going to end, you know, birthright citizenship, ordering troops to meet the migrants of the caravan at the border, claiming voter fraud. What is going on here? Is this, like, a hail Mary? Is he trying anything? You're saying the economy is about as good as any president could ever ask for, and this would be like a morning in America message. Things are good, keep going the same direction. Instead, it is midnight in America. He is trying to scare his base into voting. He is appealing to the core of his base with a negative message because he believes that fear is a great motivator. It worked for him two years ago, and he thinks it will work here. There is fear on the other side. There is fear, and you know what? This is -- this is the first time that America will have the chance to go to the polls to render judgment on Donald Trump's presidency. This is the first time, so I think that is why you are seeing such massive turnout, and we are shattering all records. All kinds of records. For a midterm election. Yeah. We are shattering those records and you have fear. Those who don't like him, who hate what he stands for and what he has done and fear from his base that he is doing the best. And that the caravan is going to come into the country even though they are 700 miles away, and they are mostly children and people who are fleeing horrible situations in Honduras, right? I interviewed him a few days ago, and he said this is an invasion. They are invading our country and, you know, they are 700 miles away. Some of the poorest people in the world, but that is the message that he is taking. Now that message may work with some of these deep red states where we have big senate races, but here's the problem for Republicans is the house races are being fought in suburbs and where independent voters are the key voters, where moderates are the key, and that is not a message that you would think would work with those people. One key race people are talking about is the race in Georgia, the governor's race, and we had Stacey Abrams on the show. Yeah. She is very popular, and she has accused her opponent, Brian Kemp, who is I guess, the secretary of state who is overseeing the very election that he is in, of voter suppression. What is going on there? Do you have predictions about that race? I think it goes to a runoff because neither one of them has 50%, and it's a runoff, and I think it's that close. There are some real concerns. First of all, he is secretary of state. They have gone through, and he has taken 50,000 registered voters and because there has been some slight -- if it's not an exact match, and the form isn't done right, challenged their registration which means those people with still vote, but they must vote with a provisional ballot and that is something that can definitely have an impact today. The other thing is this allegation that he made of cybercrimes that the democratic party of Georgia has committed cybercrimes and hacked into the website. It's an extraordinary allegation to make on the eve of an election and he has done it without any offering any evidence whatsoever. Whatsoever. Okay. Let's talk about Texas. Meghan and I have an argument that I say Beto could win and she says it's impossible. She will take my to dinner if I win. Fy if I win I get nothing apparently. We have to even this out a little bit. I'll buy you a margarita. A margarita or a dinner? Give me a break. This is Democrat dirty games. We both get a nice dinner, okay? Deal. Beto has raised $38 million. In three months. This is amazing. No one has ever done that. Presidential level numbers. Yeah, and also there is a lot of early voting in Texas which to me, that indicates that a lot of people are out there voting for Beto instead of Cruz because they know Cruz, you know, is old school already. We're sick of him already, but we have got this new guy. What do you think of that? Politico has an article that they just did, and put up the other day. How Beto blew it, and it would be interesting to see him win so you could go back to that article. It would be because he went to left instead of moderating like he should have done in Texas. He didn't do a lot of the traditional. He ran a very, you know, campaign of hope and change, very obama-esque without some of the real Obama research and -- Obama had a very disciplined campaign. John Kennedy, more than anybody else. He ran a completely nationalized campaign with outside money. He went -- this article, he went completely way too far. Fine. He has charisma. I want in on the bet. Can we all get a piece of this? Either way if I win or lose I end up paying. That's how I feel all the time. There is no favorite. It would be a colossal episode, and if Cruz wins, he is the front runner. He is popular, and has been for some time. It's closer than people expected. I want to ask about Florida because Florida was the one trump won in 2016 when everybody woke up and said, this might end differently, and the governor race is fascinating. Ron Desantis has tied himself with Donald Trump, and Gillum who is running to the left on the policies. A Bernie sanders-esque campaign. Yeah. He might win. He is ahead. One or two points. I would say going into today, Gillum is the front runner in that race. I agree with you. Is that bad? It's bad for trump because Desantis was chosen by trump because he was not the front runner for the Republican nomination. It was a guy named Putnam that was, you know -- Better liked in Florida by the way. Had a long career in Florida. He had won statewide office before, and he got on board with Desantis because he likes him so much. Exactly. It could be a surprise. Now Gillum is the front runner. Why are governor races just as important as the senate and house? You could argue in long-term more important because we are going into another census and round of redistricting. The governors that are elected today will have a huge impact on how the house race and how the house districts are drawn. The Jerry mandering? Yes, and going forward. And Republicans right now dominating across the country and they could lose in a lot of states today that the trump carried, you know. Wisconsin is a tough race. Scott walker. Bye-bye. It's walker's fourth time running many, you know, and it will be his third term, but he had the recall election. He has won three, but he has had a tough race. Iowa and Ohio is a tough race.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "Transcript for Pres. Trump says he regrets not using a 'softer tone' at times\n\nWell, it's finally here, the midterm elections are happening right now so if you did not get out to vote yet, I did. Make sure you get out there after the show. ABC news chief white house white house correspondent will be joining us, and if you have questions about eligibility and polling hours, we have info on our website to check us out. We will be getting into the vital issues that many people will be voting on today, but on a much lighter note, another annual election. I'm so moved by this one. Was just held, and I feel like the whole country just might be able to agree on this. The person voted \"People\" magazine's sexiest man alive is -- Okay? Okay? Everybody, left, right, center, black, white, Orange, yellow, green, fuchsia, can get behind that. Okay? That's right. Everybody. Oh, yeah. I mean, I almost feel that it's late to name him the sexiest man alive because he has been sexy for a minute. Let's face it. When Idris came onto the show, we had a really special moment together. I think we have a clip. I thought we all did. You did those stunts? Yes, baby. You're talking to Idris Elba here, okay? Did I just get a yes, baby from Idris Elba? Did that just happen? He is now the sexiest man alive. A woman in the audience could see that we had that moment, right? I didn't want to tell you this, but you know -- Don't tell me, whoopi. I had the whole evening with him. No. And I wasn't invited? And his lady. Well, there is that. Well, there is that. You know. He is engaged to a lovely woman actually. When you get to be a certain age, you can't look at these men like that. You can't lick your lips anymore. All you can do is go, how nice to see you again, you know? When really, you're, like, baby. But on a certain age, that jus don't look good, you know what I mean? He took the opportunity to tell people to get out and vote. Yeah. Which means he is not only sexy, but he is brilliant. He has also been a contender for years, and it's nice to see him. I was looking back at sexiest man alive. The first one was Mel Gibson in 1985, 25 years old. Can we make him James bond now? Please? I think he should be the next James bond. Of course. Yep. So now onto other things. You know, the guy in the white house has been rallying around the country and yesterday, he was asked if he has any regrets and here's what he said. Take a look. I would like to have a much softer tone. I feel to a certain extent, I have no choice, but maybe I do, and maybe I could have been softer from that standpoint, but I want to get things done. I'm not sure that if I did, that maybe I would be swamped, okay? Swamped meaning with the other side because I wouldn't say their tone has been so nice either, but that would be something I say I'll be working on. So, he then went on to have several rallies last night, and of course, the tone wasn't what he said he would like it to be, but he went back to business as usual at all three rallies. So, you know, I don't know why they are asking this question B but I'm going to ask it because it's on the monitor. So why do you think he said that? He said it -- he said it because he realizes that women like him less than menstrual cramps. That's why he said it. So appealing to women. Yes. He now has, like, this moment where he says, gee. They don't like me because do you see the numbers? The women are out there voting in droves. He now realizes that. He polls around 34% with women, so yes. It's not great. The women that still like him say that he is a protector. A hero. That he protects -- Their way of life and their values. They don't know the difference between a predator and a protector because as far as I can tell, he is the one grabbing women by the you know what. I try to find the positive in these moments and I think the one thing about his tone that has been helpful for this country is it motivated people to get out and vote. On the other side. Whether you like the tone or you hate the tone, people are voting. We're already seeing this. 31 million people have already cast their ballots for this election. I don't know if that's worth the tone. I don't know if that's worth it. I don't know if him calling people names and talking about families and, you know, scaring people into thinking that brown people are coming to get them and take their jobs -- It shows that people care. No. It shows that people are scared and they know -- they know that this is not what you want in the guy that's supposed to be running stuff, but I don't know if the tone is -- I can take a lot of stuff. As I said weeks ago, you know, when you start the conversation with, they are murderers and rapists or they are this or they are that, for me that shuts everything down. I can't hear anything. There is a lot of this going ongoing forward. The Democrat wills probably end up taking the house, and I think they should have some historical perspective. We don't know yet. We don't, but if you are betting in Vegas, you can put at least a small majority win, with the tea party wave, Republicans picked up 63 house seats. Tonight, we're looking at 20 something for Democrats, and that shows that the tone whether he regrets it or not, it hasn't made nearly as much of an impact as it did in 2010, and what's interesting about this race, president Obama traditionally had a difficult time garnering votes in midterm election when is he wasn't at the top of the ticket. We'll see tonight if president trump has the same problem. He goes around saying the ticket is about me. It's smart politics, but -- It's all about him. He made a referendum on himself, and I wonder -- Even though he says it's not about him. What would that be? It will be interesting to see if he can do what president Obama did. I know we're late on time. On tone, I think it's too late. I don't think it matters anymore if he regrets or not. I think the cast has been dyed, and I think ultimately we know who this man is, and whether or not it matters to you, character over policy is what we'll be seeing tonight.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "A Bangladeshi immigrant charged with detonating a homemade pipe bomb in a passageway between subway stations in New York City was found guilty on all charges Tuesday.\n\nInterested in New York?

Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nAfter racking up thousands of miles on Air Force One, flying all over the country for an unprecedented number of raucous campaign rallies, President Trump is having a quiet Election Day at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nWith the future of his presidency and control of Congress at stake, the president was lying low on Tuesday. He would be \u201cmaking phone calls, monitoring Congressional, Senate and Gubernatorial races across the country and meeting with his political team for real-time updates,\u201d press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters in the early hours of Election Day after the president arrived back at the White House shortly before 2 a.m.\n\n\"Later this evening the President and First Lady have invited family and friends to join them in the residence as they watch election returns,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nTrump's blitz of 44 \"Make America Great Again\" rallies took him to 23 states since the primaries began, and culminated in three events that stretched late into the night. The final stretch played out like a rock and roll reunion tour, as the president\u2019s advisers. including Sanders and Kellyanne Conway and his favorite Fox News pundits including Sean Hannity and Judge Jeanine Pirro stumped for the president\u2019s agenda \u2013 and Republicans \u2013 on stage to a cheering crowd at his final rally Monday evening in Cape Girardeau, Missouri.\n\n\"I had no idea you were going to invite me up here,\" Hannity said after being called on stage. \"And the one thing that has made and defined your presidency more than anything else: Promises made, promises kept.\"\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Fox News called the appearance of network talent at the president's political rally \"an unfortunate distraction.\" During the rally, Hannity pointed to news reporters there to cover the event calling them \"fake news.\"\n\n\u201cFox News does not condone any talent participating in campaign events,\u201d the news network said in a statement. \u201cWe have an extraordinary team of journalists helming our coverage tonight and we are extremely proud of their work. This was an unfortunate distraction and has been addressed.\u201d\n\nJim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe president was relatively subdued in his Election Day tweets, his first trying to debunk a \"rumor\" he claimed Democrats were spreading that GOP Senate candidate Josh Hawley, left the Missouri rally early.\n\nThere is a rumor, put out by the Democrats, that Josh Hawley of Missouri left the Arena last night early. It is Fake News. He met me at the plane when I arrived, spoke at the great Rally, & stayed to the very end. In fact, I said goodbye to him and left before he did. Deception! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2018\n\nWhile it's unclear what exactly Trump was referring to, it appears host Brian Kilmeade on \"Fox & Friends\" Tuesday morning alleged Hawley didn't stay the entire time.\n\n\"How will that translate down the ticket with people maybe not invited to those rallies and why Josh Hawley didn't stay last night for the Missouri rally is beyond me. What could he have been doing that was so important?\" Kilmeade said.\n\nThe national crisscrossing and finale in states with tight races like Missouri, Indiana, and Ohio was a calculated plan from Trump\u2019s political strategists who studied how former Presidents Obama and Bush traveled in midterm years and planned to top their schedules. Neither Obama nor Bush campaigned as much as Trump in previous election years.\n\nVice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen Pence plan to visit Walter Reed Military Medical Center in the late afternoon on Election Day. The Pences of Indiana \u2013 like the Trumps of New York \u2013 voted absentee in their home states.\n\nThe president loomed large over the 2018 midterm elections, and he admitted that even though his name isn\u2019t on the ballot, this election is also a referendum on him and his administration\u2019s policies. But while Republicans are confident in their ability to hold onto the Senate, the House faces an uncertain future.\n\nDays before the election, the president appeared to admit for the first time that Republicans might lose the House. \"It could happen,\" Trump said. \"And you know what you do? My whole life, you know what I say? 'Don't worry about it, I'll just figure it out.'\" Trump said.\n\nOn Saturday at the White House, the president said the difference between the potential House and Senate outcomes is that he wasn\u2019t able to stump for all the House candidates on the ticket.\n\n\"The difference is I can't campaign for all of those House members. There's so many of them. But I can go out and help Senators and I think I've made a big difference,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president\u2019s final pitch for Republicans mostly focused on the red-meat issue of immigration to animate his base. Even in states thousands of miles away from the southern border, the president riled up voters as he described the migrant caravan from Central America as an \u201cinvasion,\u201d falsely told voters that undocumented immigrants are gang members, and commit crimes, and made the allegation that Democrats are working to bring undocumented immigrants into the country.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, Democrats are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws and violate our borders. And they want to sign them up for free welfare, free health care, free education, and most importantly, they want to give them the right to vote,\u201d Trump said at his final campaign stop.\n\nEven though the Labor Department reported strong employment numbers days before the election with a low unemployment rate of 3.7 percent, a quarter of a million jobs added to the workforce and wage increases, the president said he bucked the advice of his advisors and focused on other issues.\n\n\"They all say 'speak about the economy, speak about the economy.' Well, we have the greatest economy in the history of our country. But sometimes it's not as exciting to talk about the economy, right? \u2018Cause we have a lot of other things to talk about,\" Trump said in West Virginia.\n\nTuesday\u2019s election results will test whether the former reality star\u2019s messaging -- to make the 2018 midterm elections about an \u201cinvasion\u201d of migrants that hasn\u2019t happened \u2013 is a success. No matter the results, the president signaled he would not take the blame.\n\n\"I've seen many of the newspapers saying it's a referendum on what we've done, so I don't know about that, but I can tell you that's the way they're going to play it, and if we don't have a good day, they are going to make it like it\u2019s the end of the world,\u201d Trump said in a call with the supporters the day before the election.\n\n\u201cThe election,\u201d Trump said, \u201cis very vital because it really is summing up what we've done, it's going to show confidence for what we've done.\u201d\n\n\"Even though I'm not on the ballot in a certain way I am on the ballot,\" Trump said.\n\nCoverage of the 2018 midterms on ABC News Live:\n\nGet full election coverage on ABC News Live beginning today at 4:30 p.m. EST at ABCNews.com/Live, on the ABC News app and on Roku, Hulu and Facebook.", "bad url", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "Transcript for Police officer saves baby while working overtime on Halloween\n\nIn this line of work you were a lot of hats.

Fairly heated there not only for the house and senate but also for the governor race with Johnson is in Tallahassee. With the latest on that which lets over the governor's race it doesn't get much closer than this. Absolutely Diane and really it would be a major election without drama happening in Florida and capital Pristina play out we are outside. One of the polling locations here this is the Catholic Church polls open at 7 AM there's been a steady stream of people going in to cast their ballots including. The Democrat running for governor. Mayor Andrew gill I'm he was here with his wife with his children casting a vote for himself about the same time. His Republican opponent Ron Desantis was casting his ballot itself a Jacksonville Florida this morning. Let's talk about the candidates here the Tallahassee mayor Andrew Dillon was really an underdog in the primary not expected to win but he got huge support for millions of dollars coming from outside donors who was endorsed early on by. Bernie Sanders a true progressive and then you've had Barack Obama the former president you've got Hillary Clinton in this state campaigning for Andrew Dellums. On the Republican side Ron Desantis. Practically hand picked by president Donald Trump he is all in. On the trump agenda he's a congressman who actually resigned his seat so that he he could focus on this race there's even an early campaign ads showing Desantis. Building the trumped wall with toy blocks with his daughter. Now this has been an ugly battle from the start though allegations of racism. Hurled toward Desantis accusations of corruption directed at Gil -- it's been back and forth and back and forth and in some ways both candidates acknowledged that. That the ugliness has in some ways overshadowed the real issues that matter to people here in Florida like healthcare like immigration. Like the environment and the issues with the toxic algae here the economy and much more. Let's go ahead and listen to both candidates this morning making their final plea to voters. Well me plus winning tonight I think we'll send a message to mr. trump and mr. Desantis is well. That the politics of hatred and a division of separation. That they come to win game at least in this election that's what we're going to show that people are going out and they're voting for something and not against. We've really at every turn in spite of all the distractions. I tried to keep voters in this state focus on what matters. I believe that that is what it went to allow us to walk away with a win today. Andrews agenda a massive tax increases. Working against law enforcement you name it. That is get it do damage to this state that has got out that families lives at their kitchen table. On an everyday basis and so this one really does matter. You know one thing that his interest in talking to the voters here president Trump's name may not be on the ballot in Florida but you wouldn't know it if you talk to the voters they are very much. Casting a vote to either support and promote. Or reject the trouble agenda. You talk about early voting quickly want to give you some numbers already coming in. Five point two million people in Florida have already voted early either absentee votes or voting in person that is a record. If you break it down Republican and Democrat it's almost split with Democrats just having the slightest edge. The democratic candidates also having a slight edge in the polls but it is all about turnout anything can happen in the state of Florida Diane. And I want rain Mary Alice parks here where marry us how surprise you to see that break down. You know we're going to be watching those numbers in the southern part of the state X specially the Miami area were injured Gillen was really hoping to expand the electric and get new voters. Who maybe haven't voted in the past but he tend to tilt. To the Democratic Party. Out in big numbers and there are a number of very key congressional races. In the southern Florida and Miami area where Democrats are helping to flip on Republicans and went on that note mr. Brady downpours was going on there in terms of those congressional seats. Exactly Walt what's interesting about the congressional seats you have some of these c.s that were held by long time Republicans but. Hillary Clinton won those districts by double digits in some places to the most competitive districts she won via fifteen points another one she won by twenty points. The Republican and one is retiring and so that's become a competitive race. Also aside from the house races you have this huge senate race that's going on here the longtime senator. Three term senator Bill Nelson who was also a congressman he was a state lawmaker one of the first members of congress to fly in space. Obviously he is a household name here and Florida. In the fight for his career. Up against Florida Republican governor Rick Scott. Who's had a frosty hot and cold relationship would Donald Trump he's been one of the early supporters and he was endorsed by president trump. But also in recent months has distanced himself on some key issues on immigration the separation of families. Com also on other things like gun control following the park when shooting. Rick Scott was front and center taking on the MR and knowing how important Florida it is. Continued to maintain his support for Rick Scott just some perspective here this is the state of 1%. It's when he sixteenth president from beat Hillary Clinton by about 1% and 2012. President Obama beat Mitt Romney by about 1% the last two governors' races forty tents when he fourteen Rick Scott won both of those. By just about 1%. Don't we save turnout is everything it sounds like a cliche but nowhere else is a more important in the crucial swing state. And Florida.

The vote today now Pennsylvania will play a big role in the night indicators state Democrats have a chance to pick up six. House seats here in the east and sit a large. Reason for dies because of the brand new redistricting. Map in Pennsylvania and that is really going to play out tonight as we see. How many of these districts switched their some competitive races that we are watching. Democratic Party we spoke with some of that they represented they told they actively recruited. People to run in these districts they were looking for people who work local run these areas moderate people they a lot of veterans and women. Running so we could see some very interesting race is shaping up to now as those numbers start to come in. And of course how many seats the Democrats are able to pick up here in Pennsylvania will greatly sorted. F back and sort of shape the night as it progresses odd that we of course will be following. All of this as a night happens I and. All right either pilgrim from Philadelphia we appreciated even marry us you know one things that even mention was the redistricting. I know Democrats are feeling a bit more confident about that coming in an impact do you think that'll have. That new map in Pennsylvania was a huge gift to Democrats this year the court weighed in and send the map is unfair they try to drop a new map to. Make people feel more represented in their own areas all map was like his weird spite around and that's pretty simple attack and that new maps alone is probably gonna give Democrats three pick ups.

It's nasty races is probably the best way to describe it. Is taking place in Georgia we have seen racist robocalls questions about voting security accusations. On both sides of the IL and Steve most and Sami is just outside Atlanta. With the latest on that Steve what's the latest on these election hacking allegations at seem to me the last part of this soap opera. Well on Saturday the secretary of state Brian camp who is also the Republican candidate for governor. Accused the democratic party of hacking into state voter rolls he then said that he alerted the F. And has asked the FBI to investigate these. We try getting some confirmation from the FBI as to whether they're looking into this matter and so far they have no comment on the issue. The president appeared with Brian camp at a rally that a day later and neither of the two mentioned this. Camp says that he is just doing his job. There is a long long long deep and Louise story about all this happened. Democrats are saying that this is absolutely false 100% made up and as a distraction. Meant to gin up. But support for Brian camp on his side. Of the aisle. As you might not has also been lots of talk about voter suppression. Our officials sort of taking any effort to try to ensure that every vote is counted. So what's happening is that the Democratic Party is set up a hot line. For people to call if they have issues then and there are many issues happening today we're hearing about something in Gwinnett County. North of where I am right now about machines not working and so on and so forth. But on the other side there is also the concern about voter fraud that's what you're gonna hear conservatives and Republicans talk about especially Stacey Abrams. The democratic nominee wins tonight they are concerned about voter fraud they too have set up a hotline. To the secretary of State's office. I want to talk about those Ruble calls that you mention though about how ugly this race has become. So of all of the people to visiting campaigned for Stacey Abrams and I'm talking about President Obama US senators no wind. Got more attention on both sides than Oprah Winfrey her visit here added gas to the fire. And I really really upset many people on the right. And then also caused a group to put out these racist rubble calls. That described her as aunt Jemima and we have her response to that right now. Jesus only. And we know what to do about that. Votes. Tomorrow cello cello send. It's. A lot of people of course have been heeding her message I have with me now Diane I want to introduce. To you went to you to young women who like just I'm just beating right now c'mon in. They are too young voters and common are saying this is the first time you to avert an. Yet it is what it creates a getting claim Claire so tell me about how big it it was at this thing and there. Actually. Expect to get there we're surprised and now you're both in high school is that right yeah senior that the cameras seniors at so when did you registered. I'm we registered Irish about to put together a say in so what do you think about the race who are you here voted for your willingness. Not saying and I'd rather not. Say that diets I was a lot of research of on the candidates and it was hard to find. I like an unbiased source particularly in this race but we did as much research as it. What do you think about the ugliness of the race have you seen some of these commercials yes I have. And I don't know I feel like it's it's very much just trying to get. It is a lot of just trying to get support and I don't know how much street is behind all of them. I don't know it's very difficult to find information and I feel like is. Just write them. And tonight you guys know that if no one gets up to 50% tonight there's a runoff. Will you vote in the runoff. I would like. What's your message to people across the country who were watching this right now about this race and in particular the governor's race. Let's say and I think it's very important to I think. They kind of civic duty. Yard pass soon but. I say I'm very excited that it's here because. I feel like I can contribute to my country and it's at right that I am very proud eyes it definitely feels good to finally have my opinion out there. For the country into its represent. All right well thank you very much it's a pleasure to see you here I'm very warmed in my heart to see young people voting. Thank you the pleasure meeting you pleasure meeting you too. Thank you thank you very much. So too young voters who are voting we have seen long lines across town I have friends across the city who have been sending me pictures. A very long lines at high schools. At churches people who you thought what a vote literally able waited until today to vote. The early voting numbers were incredible in the state of Georgia. An all time record numbers and we're seeing what could be a record turnout today as well got him. That does seem to be the common theme Stephen I want to bring in Mary Alice on this as well because. Is Stacey Abrams has launched if it kind of very different campaign. Than the traditional Democrat her election could be historic as the first African American woman governor but also just the way she's campaigning welcomed the results of this race mean. For her message and what does that do for the party. It could mean we have an entirely new a Democratic Party. I'm the last two years the parties really tried to rebuild itself and Stacey Abrams is certain testing a theory about how Democrats run in the south. She's been. Open about her support for gun safety reforms and assault weapons ban she's talking about student loan debt and expanding health care access trying to register new young voters and and voters that are why in the south. And not necessarily working towards the middle like we've seen Democrats in the past. So she were to win not only wouldn't be so historic for the country but would really set a new tone for the Democratic Party.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Transcript for Voters head to the polls\n\nAs you mention the early voter turnout is already record this could be the first time in mid term elections we see 100 million American voters Mary Alice parks is here.

Democrats would have to net to get to pick up two democratic senators to flip control. The senate. That's a much more of an uphill battle for them there's only 35 senators that are up for re election and ten of those senators are Democrats defending in very red states ramming of the presidents are focused more of his efforts on trying to protect the senate.

The episode was caught on her daughter\u2019s camera and started an online conversation about corporal punishment.\n\nIt's a hot topic.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics has just come out with a new policy statement urging that parents avoid both \"physical punishment and verbal abuse of children,\" citing evidence that links corporal punishment to \"an increased risk of negative behavioral, cognitive, psychosocial, and emotional outcomes for children.\"\n\nCorporal punishment -- defined as noninjurious, open-handed hitting with the intention of modifying child behavior -- is both ineffective for changing behavior and damaging to children and teens, the AAP said.\n\n\"In one study, young children who were spanked more than twice a month at age 3 were more aggressive at age 5,\" a press release accompanying the policy statement this week said. \"Those same children at age 9 still exhibited negative behaviors and lower receptive vocabulary scores, according to the research.\"\n\nThe effects of corporal punishment as well as harsh verbal abuse can actually change a child's brain, the organization said.\n\n\"Research has shown that striking a child, yelling at or shaming them can elevate stress hormones and lead to changes in the brain's architecture. Harsh verbal abuse is also linked to mental health problems in preteens and adolescents,\" the release said.\n\nThe AAP urges doctors to advise parents against using corporal punishment either in a moment of anger or in a planned response to misbehavior, and to opt instead for \"positive and effective parenting strategies of discipline.\"\n\n\u201cAdults caring for children [should] use healthy forms of discipline, such as positive reinforcement of appropriate behaviors, setting limits, redirecting, and setting future expectations,\u201d the organization said.\n\nThe AAP's new policy statement \"strengthens its call to ban corporal punishment,\" it said. In 2000, the group recommended that all states to abolish the practice of corporal punishment in schools.\n\nThis week's statement, focused on families, also seems to build on an earlier one in 1998 that recommended pediatricians \"use a comprehensive approach\" when advising parents and encourage the development of disciplinary \"methods other than spanking.\"\n\nSupport of corporal punishment is generally declining in the U.S.: In 1995, 80 percent of parents reported spanking their child, which fell to 67 percent of parents in 2013, one poll found.\n\nBut in 2015, over half of U.S. adults believed it was necessary to use physical force to discipline a child. This was true across different ethnic groups as well as different regions of the country, according to a study published in the Journal of Child and Family Studies.\n\nSince 1989, the United Nations Convention on Rights of the Child has called on all member states to ban corporal punishment, and 53 countries have done so.\n\nBut in the U.S., nineteen states still allowed corporal punishment in schools as of 2016, according to a study which also said and physical discipline was meted out to 160,000 children in the 2011-12 school year.\n\n\"I hear from many parents, 'I was hit and I turned out fine,' to which I say, 'Every developing little brain is different,'\" said Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, a pediatrician in California and a consultant to ABC News.\n\n\"The goal I hear from parents is a desire to teach, and when children are hit, they see themselves as the victim and automatically turn off their learning,\u201d Bracho-Sanchez said.\n\n\"It is important for parents to remember children are always watching, so we as adults need to model the behavior we want to see in children\u201d, Bracho-Sanchez said. \"Consistent limits and consequences are also very important \u2026 For example, if the child doesn\u2019t pick up her toys, say you will put them away for the rest of the day and actually follow through.\"\n\nRepeated use of corporal punishment has been associated with increased aggression in school, and increased risk of mental health and substance abuse disorders. In one study, it was even associated with physical dating violence as adolescents, the AAP said. On a biological level, young adults who experienced significant corporal punishment actually had visible changes to the brain itself on imaging, and elevated cortisol hormone levels that are associated with toxic stress.\n\nThe AAP recommendation focuses more broadly than on just physical punishment, saying parents should avoid any disciplinary action, including verbal abuse, that shames or humiliates a child.\n\nThe group is also reminding pediatricians to advocate for effective discipline policies in their states and communities.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting softer,\" said Dr. Ryan Brown, a board-certified pediatrician and a member of the AAP's council on child abuse and neglect in a statement. \"I think we\u2019re getting smarter with our discipline.\u201d\n\nDr. Tiffany Yeh completed pediatrics residency at Brown University, and is currently an endocrinology fellow at New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "Guests visiting Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios this morning are in for a holiday treat: the first sights of the holiday season have just arrived in Toy Story Land!\n\nToy Story Land, which opened at the park earlier in 2018, allows guests to explore the fun and adventure of Andy\u2019s backyard at Slinky Dog Dash, Alien Swirling Saucers and Toy Story Mania!

The Russian campaign to under mine our elections ongoing and the timing could not be worse. On the eve of one of the most closely watched and consequential elections of our lifetime. One voter caught in the chaos, Aaron Mcgee. We caught up with him at a trump rally. A staunch supporter of the president. Especially his stance on immigration. I've often referred to Donald Trump as the trump card. Mcgee's views informed in part by social media. He frequently consumes and shares posts that reenforce his political perspective. I think social media are just a reflection basically of what people think. Last year he shared a Facebook post from a page called \"Stop all invaders\" which was filled with anti-immigration rhetoric what he didn't know, what he thought was a pro-american post was actually created by a Russian. I had no idea that it was not a post made by an American. Or U.S. Permanent resident. It was all part of a years' long multi facetted Russian campaign attempts at hacking the voting system and robust campaign on social media that touched on hot button issues such as immigration, gun control and race relations. Was often about sewing the vision and about leveraging the controversies that are already existing in society. Just last month, a Russian woman, Elena khusyaynovaa was indicted alleged by part of a conspiracy behind that stop all invaders Facebook page post like Mcgee shares but she denied the allegation. Mcgee says it didn't work on him anyway. In no way whatsoever was a influenced. So far the special counsel Robert Mueller has inexcited 13 other Russians in their involvement in the disinformation campaign. Last year I travelled to Russia to see for myself what happens inside one of these so-called troll factories. I'm from ABC news in the United States. Cut. I was quickly turned away. But an under cover journalist provided us footage showing rows of troll inside the internet research agency which was later named in one of Robert Mueller's indictments. And the disinformation campaign was just the beginning. Next step, motivating Americans to take their frustrations off line and on to the streets. Conrad James an activist from Raleigh, North Carolina, says he was approached by a woman who claimed to represent black matters U.S. To his dismay he later learned they were an allegedly russian-group. They make the entire movement look bad. Who else was hooked like me by the same group. Now the lead up to this midterm election day American intelligence officials warn their subterfug. Reporter: Reporter: Has not stopped. This is culmination of two years of massive investment we have made in people and technology to ensure our platforms are safe and secure place for elections. Disinformation campaigns are by no mean it's the only threat to American democracy. Russia likely targeted all states in the elections in attempt to access databases guys valuable election information. In theory it could be startlingly easy. . This year hackers made headlines at defcon conference teaching an 11-year-old how to exploit website they created. You can change the name, the vote. Even the party. You can change whatever you wanted. The point was to show how vulnerable our election infrastructure really is. Could take me less than five minutes maybe or five minutes. Harry is one of the lead organizers this annual gathering of hackers. This is my first assisted hack. So this is connected to that behind. He brought with him a real voting machine that had been decommissioned few years ago. As he showed us Alzheimer's you kneel to tamper with it is a basic USB drive. Too took just a few moments. You're saying somebody who is voting that actually wants to create mischief can put it something in the machine. Correct. Because this whole area is voter accessible. What would you do just suck the data out of it. You can do whatever you want. You have the same unrestricted supervisor access. Elected officials say these concerns are over blown but you don't eefb actually have to be at a polling place to tamper with the vote. This is cloud security expert with red lock tracks how hackers a access voter databases on the internet. Show me how it works. This exclamation point has a known security issue. He sets up vulnerabilities that mimic those of state board of elections. It's a honey pot for hackers, if hackers find a way into cloud based servers they could tamper with voter registration data, voter rolls and potentially ballot files which tells the voting machines who is on the ballot and how to record the vote. If they exploit this host they can do whatever they want with the files on it. As a attacker don't need to go after the voting machine. As far as we know most attempts to breach board of election sights failed but in at least one state, Illinois, Russian hackers were able to access the electronic voter registration system potentially compromising the information of 76,000 citizens. I think we're more ready than ever but still lack the stand toord secure the ecosystem, not just the voting mushes but everything that supports it. Experts say there's more needs to be done to be protected against both hackers and cyber our democracy depends on it and.

He asked for investigation from and found failed attack to hack the voter registration system and Democrats call it 100% false and abuse of power. And she responded. Do you think he deliberately cooked it up to help his campaign. This is a failure of his leadership. He realized he got caught he would lose. In 2016 he accused Obama's department of homeland security of attempting to hack their assessment but reports found no such hacking took place. He's also under fire for voter allegation suppression. It was found 53,000 voter registrations were on hold, majority of them voters of color. A federal judge assured the state they they could vote, he told my colleague he's trying to prevent voter fraud. What about voter suppression. That's a myth that Democrats bring out every two years.

Presented by the Bob Woodruff foundation and the New York comedy festival and we again on the red pepper to bring you some of the sights and sounds. A leading into this very big night in very big week for comedy to help benefit the Bob Woodruff foundation. In a post 9/11. Impacted veterans and their families who get the period and I get the help. That they deserve and need. To you witnessed Benton. Last year due to its war on the first ten minutes a lot of time it's a lot of fun pressure have a lot of fun tonight in the case. Lots of comedy we had Jimmy Hart John sewer except my areas. Jim gap again and it'll also be having performances from Bruce Springsteen as well as Eric church they think it's his first time ever Springsteen is he's been at data for here is quite a lot of times out of excited seven. That's going to be fine and into the all benefiting from 9/11. Eleven veterans and their families and again our colleague Bob Woodruff. His wife leave asserted their foundation and this is in coordination after with men and again. I want to show you look into the red carpet there's no line itself for us right now on what people have been walking and tonight we're gonna talk to. Quite a few people over the next thirty minutes or so calm as they come through they're going to be comedians. They're going to be armed. You know what we got one right here though when I bring Iran and this is. Captain Sully volleying and I think you guys might have this guy right there right there again it made me think let you know you think this is my wife Laurie its own I think you so much for joining us. Eventually you and he has now also with AB thirty. A guy is. So please tell you guys agree by the way tells why it is so important for you to be here tonight I'm a veteran and for many years. More and I have supported veterans' causes she argued that the number of years ago but one that made earlier Bob this is our first Jessica this event we're very excited to. Are there any specific comedians are looking to see in particular area comedy banning all my answer yeah I've always Jon Stewart and dale all the long peg into the mental ward knows every time the first time congress. What do you mean we did noticing alone could yeah. And I've been to accommodate yeah. Case and what's your comedic John Johnson on evening and on here yeah. That was the extent that. Ventilated a it was good it was pretty good and not talk about obviously we're concerned profound London. And those veterans who who is of the call to serve this country and have been injured in war. Your thoughts about them in their sacrifice. It takes a lot of courage to volunteer for service during wartime. And I I think we should honor that went more than just think tanks and passing them in an airport. We needed to make sure that there's other services rewarded. And an honored and that all their needs are met long after your services are complete and and right now they're assuming big gaps and that every day and make sure that their resources available to meet their needs in every way we don't gaps. And help them heal helps them be reintegrated holding a news. That's something that's an ongoing process work. Hundreds of thousands of and I think a lot of us are all went one degree separation from new we have veteran with someone who is currently serving concert. Confident even in our family. Yeah we just came back to air force academy. They had met a lot of young men and it's sad very inspiring smarts every time we leave we think it. As president. And he even though. Many of us know this. Still it's a tiny single digit fraction of our entire population that's doing all the heavy lifting. Still that's didn't stepping forward. To serve causes greater than themselves. To do for everybody else what either cannot move on to ourselves and redeeming. We got does its citizens and go it's a family thing is it tradition often so you'll find it. If someone they're not there are thought there are some analysis service. My son or daughter so it kind of runs and her dad I'm sure this organization is happy for your support as well. Think you again for doing and I think he had talked to enjoy the event tonight. Yeah have a lot so that's doing a little burners and Sony and eating you know they live thank you have a great say they do consumers doing it. It's not what. Regular. Yeah hair and famous famous Craig Newmark the founder of Craigslist hi nice to me and he has never made it seem you are doing. Let's turn a little bit but you can see. Do a really good job. It's a big deal. You know two minutes. We will photographers. And how did prince get involved with a Bob Woodruff foundation because they don't you happen to him part of that for a long time I believe I stumbled upon them. Five or six years ago it made sense to me that it made more sense and I just did stuff. You just did stuff I love that and and I know that if you might fit you're also one of the arteries for the Bob Woodruff foundation generous personal ordered. So what does you know in the context of that and coming here tonight what does it mean to you to be here at stand up for heroes for the fifth or sixth. I'm well we need to remind everyone. How much we owe vets and their families active service it's so a lot of stuff I do. It is for the opportunity to say we know lots of them all. And we did and we and again. It's an act that you're here supporting on invisible line is we'll figure again is very nicely into it though it's not my pleasure I appreciate baker grew. You read in the fight any comedians are looking forward to seeing red when they're behind. OK and again you're right in the middle after its elegant might need your little. Clinton has been and I want to listen and yeah. I don't did you I don't know her birdie. You need to adapt get everyone to live together. They're girls up didn't get the from ABC news. Nice to Israel and drew are all part of the all star line up here at home and on the involvement with the kind of for the month of the area line up also a lineup here. Now I've done this event a couple times. It's. You know per comedians I think it's probably that in one of the most prestigious events you can. The asked to do the caliber of comedians is always kind of awe inspiring and obviously. Good causes. So well respected army and there's finally a break causes valid business. Tangible experience where have. Audience some of the participants are service vehicles so its grip. And he talks a lot of you know comedy and how important it is for comedians to come here what do you think it is about. Whether it's comic. Gather crowds like this. Gosh I don't know I mean idealists. What. At least for me I've. Feel like it's the least a comedian can do our. About them. The loud mouths here that means though it's like these warriors that we can honor that somehow and but I think comedy is something that. You know has had strains. Healing property too good values and it's weird that are now I'm not gonna pretend like I understand us. And I'm not very Smart enough I'm good got planned for tonight obscurity filthy he you know I. Love that yeah that is yeah. It's strange because it isn't a very special. Show. And so I have an idea of what I'm gonna do but I also. We have done this before where I've had changed my mind as I watched the other performers. And see what's working you know it was. This is such an event. That being so generous in spirit that you. Some cynicism kind of dancing summits disrespectful so I can be setting. Even though like comedians are exposed to censor themselves but like I don't know we'll say. I'm sure some of those veterans the they're gonna love all of those things really happen because it makes me a better view of their own I'm sure that we think a probably can't be fed on television. Now it's about may be in fact enactments. Ellen gets hurt Matt. His message that you want to kind of the harder you just gave stunning gotta go with the flow on the side. I think that overall I. There's no one that would disagree with the notion that. Better veterans and their families and a can only use some more recognition events and assistance you know I wish that this. A bad weather is obsolete but I think that we're always and need to do something like that's. Before we let you go obvious that with you pervert tomorrow's kind of a big day in this country I'm from Hancock good news today. And Oakley gets on top of that you get about right. Comedians out we talk about comedy killing the nation. And we think we may need some more of that your thoughts about the big day tomorrow. While I mean I think everyone and then no you know it's weird because. There's almost this sense that nobody wants to predict any market they were so wrong twenty years ago. I didn't know I think it's going to be exciting I have to be. Optimistic. I hope a lot of people vote I hope it leads and no matter what happens that may be. Our democracy is strong with people voting and I got a good feeling but then again I'm superstitious underwent a double to hear me turn. Pay down stiff GAAP and thank you so much Goddard and me and ASEAN have fun tonight and thank you for your service to their cause yet. Thank you yeah. Again to so many celebrities comedians hear him. And that's when you lose your car through on your comedy. Islam means so that's co founded by anti oxidant Carolina parents think it was cook cited something like eleven years ago Caroline from terabytes on Broadway mom she started got about 35 years ago cities are people that have really been any greens and the the New York comedy you are hardly know all the comedians they discovered a bunch of comedians with its nice to see them on come together.

Huge TV just getting this kind of Prince Harry just we don't stay in the in Australia Arkansas recently. It's amazing to see those kind of schools. It really is and it needs people like you but the foundation to really highlight what they've gone through and the assistance that they need do you know anyone impact. Hot air or anyone deserves. And he would. In the UK here in the US I think I'd be lucky to be quite a little people. It down in there and had to coal which is that we have sent from the UK wages servicemen retreated in and did every man behind its comedy joke about eight years ago about how you know. It's a terrible thing these young remain in them calling these young great men getting injured but it means. We'll then you want to paralympics and these guys have just a minute just legendary I'm just extraordinary spokesman and that got I think espouses the same feelings go into the military.

Not liaison one veterans is here ex fiance story you read the New York marathon yesterday.

Kind of amazing news days and when his and it's looking to be involved in kind of a mixed built in humans and it feels like an old school variety show yeah we got some scenes. We'll get some play in the National Anthem of the top just a couple of guys telling jokes is going to be a lot of I'm Heidi prepare for and I like this. I will you prepare to let. In New York high tech the two nights and did five shows tonight on what count walk jokes but gonna hit about it. Just because I really kind of thing like because I'm very edgy I'm really brutal comedian actually. Playing to military giants. Visiting you can go to these troops were so what do you do show viewers give my full rights against glimpse beyond forces have a couple of with a family isn't just a little way of saying thank you. And that the best stories thanks but because it's not like I've gone on since acutely they like to brutal drug. It's thanks Mike you are amazing for me but then actually this kind of thing you know I'm personally clowns are going to be able to capitol. I'm pretty edgy you know Google me if you're watching us. Everything didn't you and I can't yeah. We're gonna go rolled out Google are going to date thank you so much is an absolute yeah a year ago that he could become an ABC exhibits. Everything behind Atlanta. Jimmy Carter now they are eating is a pretty hear what I don't know I don't think straight nonetheless responded here are some doors by the media. Yeah. And a little help here and find interviewing the comedian yeah. They really as Tom. I still under 1000 nights it was all of them as well when Martin got thrown her she's one of the kids yes really partnered when she. She's right here behind me what venture fox I believe accounting matter here. A partner with the Bob ordered the foundation to lobby against while you're for the so it's twelve years ago. After the fact seniors he isn't talking yet you're here and presumably that's been stolen in the hours ago yeah. We are going to challenge therein doesn't moment. Carol I'm gonna get divorced like ABC news. ABC news how are you come on you can admit here. Yeah you're right here please got to get this outfit in the yeah you'll be looking great tonight. Some thing twelve years you believe that you've lived. We we started as a hunch it. With a lunch stay with the lead to make this might happen twelve to thirteen years ago almost. We started in May and by November we had this this done together with Conan O'Brien Robin Williamson. Lewis black and Brian Regan and look where we are today it's incredible what the first year we did raise three million dollars commissioner and I secretaries general raised close to six million dollars. Even bigger tendency is to get you gotta be extremely proud of those numbers and what they're doing to help with so many programs are so many veterans we are with Brad and the proud mother I'm a board member. The public juice foundation. And this money goes to the greatest causes everything is headed out some kids eat there. And everything goes to these men and women better helped us in the war. Wrench your bedroom. When you think about how far you've common you've seen all of these comedians are also the founder Caroline's on Broadway do you think comedy has changed very involved in any way has stacked like. Does have standup comedians changed their crops. Well I think what we happened in the last year's admission is seen a lot more political come from when I started 35 years ago. And we have a lot more people doing comedy. And a lot more women do. So that's changing its the observational humor as you see tonight we have a prisoner jam concert that was John Oliver last year. Yeah. Yeah. Here de L yeah I'm curious about honestly. Here gets bigger and better but Gemma favoring a particular and more than ball. And you know what many years I'm. We read the beacon theater and Robin Williams was on the show and it was really that I really remember that night with him so much. This any came to the after party and its keeping all that's entertained all night. So like I really remember the world really misses him blindness and sound. The greatest dad. Opposite tonight any other little tidbits are things that maybe we don't know about that sound. Clearly. Lowered CEO we have Eric church and I am we have Bruce Springsteen so may be. Anyway and alerted him to get we have heard that yeah. At Atlanta and then a good course we have Bruce telling jokes so that we wouldn't that. And I keep harping on this how many years but I know that you wanted to keep this going keep this going what's plan for the future war this event. We didn't do it until people stop coming so we are here to do it you know we can't forget that this is not only that we have men and women that will be. Needing our help. In the next three years in the life absolutely we can't give up now and he'd ever even show this here early this year in San Francisco San every heroes went out to the West Coast. I mean so he talks about you want to keep you wanna see it keep crying but. In terms of the keep all what. What's one message that you want any part to the audience members who come to the show earlier this thing we need to impart is what I dissent before the sack. Not all of just because you think there is no war going on as we just saw. Mayor from Utah was shot and killed last week when us. So it's not over an end because it's not in the headlines every day. We can't forget about him we cannot. And thank you for your service of them as well as an incredible work that you're in the foundation. Are going to have been doing for more than a decade it's hot and these tremendous run in hand Marines into the blue room experience T. He met ABC news Bob Bob yeah do you believe there are so thank you again to bury you guys you know I'm so good to see I get any next here. Already so yeah it's is considering current or bad their doing the foundations built in so many people. Karl Malden yet. These hidden as well no definitely. Sitting here comedy festivals Felix's leader something that is really Caroline -- and oranges boxes you know they created at. It's there it's actually going to be launching this next week. So you'll be seeing very 200 comedians they're out New York City performing at different clubs including parents Carolina I'm Bradley is about something that people should be looking towards him. Flat at elevated we actually do better as Atlanta Tuesday and as well I would can't wait for that actually when it. Funeral a little bit over Dave I appreciate that they would get some veterans who are right here who we're gonna grab students work. Republican began this night it all at home and then again we are alive. The red carpet here in Madison square garden and Bob brings special coverage of stand up for heroes again the twelve year for this incredible event presented by Bob Woodruff foundation in the New York comedy festival. And as we step before and we can't see it enough that this benefits goes both not eleven impacted veterans. And their families and it raises funds and awareness and support the foundation and a godsend right LA. I just can't eat good and as you so much of digital yeah yeah let me say that first offense again. What was that like to hear tonight yeah. It's it's amazing we can imagine being on this platform. And help our the problem. Woodruff foundation being able to and our own nonprofit project summary a lot there. This is just an amazing guy. We never expected that. Talk a bit more about project unbreakable because I think it's such an important organization that you guidelines that just like to hear you kind of talk about. How it came to be Evans. Where you're at now. So we came across unbreakable back in 2015. Alone and we're small it's just turn I would do work. Now we do my home wearing a suicide prevention for military veterans and first responders. Our one of the very few nonprofits to incorporate first responders are simply because it's. Alone not to mention in effect in 2005 my dad was a police officer and upstate New York when he years. Concert is and why so it's it's personal for us. And Jim was a police officer for yours well so we just want to make sure there were able to get out there and save lives that way you know. Families don't have to go to. We wanted to. I'm curious when it comes to matters we know there can be shy about talking. There's so that's. But it really we think stand up for heroes and hero within through words and IP. Doesn't really to describe the sacrifices that are made by this one that can get pretty close. When it's when we talk about service and those were still impacted and so living way. You'll often ran into war and mental health issues. Are yet obviously traumatic brain trauma. About the needs for those veterans. All right now as far as mental health on investments we need so much fun being just by the stigma that we're going to be receiving. And now only eight hits are not enough health care providers but ones that history specifically veterans who have experience kind of stuff. We're just hire bears upstairs over counseling. Because we've experienced those things it's. About values proved effective community be hidden for counseling. And we're like to see projects unbreakable at 510 years. Home as of right now you know are our five year plan is. Just it to be owl and Jane is much traction as we possibly can. You know whether it's still just her night getting out there on a platform. Saying hey there's a real problem pants. We need to address it now. You know that's that's one of our biggest thing is getting now speaking against the stigma that is so strong in the backs in the first commuter first responders communities. And so you know we're gonna push this. As as far as we possibly can. And who knows five years ten years from now hopefully will be known nationally nationwide end will be fairly big like the Bob Woodruff foundation. We'll where we're happy to help you with bat and that could give as much publicity to that it's possible again. I can means anything the organization of what we're gonna help you will get more from me synagogue or. Kimberly and Justin eight. I just unbreakable dollar and yeah.

Being deployed to our bags and 2005 week we've got hit by an idea to get back home to preliminarily 2006 and sadly similar. More and alienation for veterans out there says that guy needs to a suicide attack word. I spent over thirty hours seem to beta and yeah 2800. Interest so who might be coming back from their deployment.

Just three child there's many people and. Looking to see how they can help the veterans can meaning. And leaving cars and other champions and you're not alone and there's a lot of people out there. Manages its long odds we have to sad fact that we need help and Gaza hardest part because. Coming up someone else. You've benefit benefited from programs that help veterans.

Yes indeed Bob Woodruff foundation are our sponsor on the platoon leader effort. Put Regan. Michigan seniors first continues in it's been an amazing journey so hard on the island and yes. Then when you think about everything that you experience and overcome. What does it need continued to be here tonight at an event that's honoring them. Wow better so I would say it's its armaments and it's time that people needs to understand that and not because I'm a veteran. Wars I meant to leave you today as civilians. We shared. A lot more that we and we have to end up and finished with this thing. Right now we're not crazy and we're just going through artery of the heart heart trusses that won't leave those who went through that. Nails and let me tell you this fashion. 90%.

It's incredible that very able to come together and they like best. Is incredible and I'm. See people like that who they know those numbers they're. Passionate about making sure so many veterans get the help that they need gas and and even though it's a good. That right there yeah.

So you were injured during an idea explosion and getting in Afghanistan in 2005. It was early on. I remember personally covering stories of those who lives veterans who were coming homes and those were injured. Do you feel there's as much attention. I'm sure I technically an audience and there's not. As much attention is a wireless. In 2000 five's there is now but what do we need to do to bring more attention. They continue to talk about a given the awareness that you know still going not NL. Now we haven't been as many injuries that we use to know which is great that's himself why do we want the less you know these obviously great way.

The fighting occurred \"over a 35-minute period\" and involved at least six children, police said. Video shows that the children wore oversized gloves on their hands when they were fighting.\n\nNicole Merseal\n\n\"At one point during the video, Guliford, while watching the children fight, can be seen jumping up and down with excitement,\" police said in a statement.\n\nOne child who was encouraged to fight, \"suffered red marks and swelling on his face and forehead\" as well as a black eye, according to police.\n\nThe St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department said neither Guliford nor Dailey were currently in custody.\n\nCourt records do not show that the two woman have attorneys yet and they have not given public statements. Records also show that the women were issued a summons on Monday, have not made a plea, and are not due back in court until next month.\n\nNicole Merseal told ABC News in an interview that in December of 2016 her then-4-year-old son was encouraged to fight another child by Guliford and Dailey at the Adventure Learning Center. She filed a lawsuit over the incident .\n\nSt. Louis Metropolitan Police Department\n\nMerseal accused the day care center of directing a \"fight club\" in court documents, and permitting another child \"to intimidate and harm\" her son.\n\n\"My son was very afraid,\" Merseal told ABC News. \"He didn't understand why his best friends beat him up. These are children that he's been around for a couple years. He described them as his best friends. He just doesn't understand why they punched him in the face. ... I don't know any parent that could watch their children go through this and not be upset.\"\n\nMerseal said her two older sons who were at the day care center witnessed the incident.\n\nSt. Louis Metropolitan Police Department\n\nWhen the teachers did not stop the children fighting in December 2016, one of her older sons took a video of the incident on his iPad and sent it to his mother, Merseal's attorney, Jennifer Hansen, told ABC News.\n\n\"When I got the video, I was just in complete shock. I immediately left work,\" Merseal said. \"I also called the day care immediately and told them to go stop the fighting.\"\n\nIn documents released by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services , Jennifer Scott, the director of the center, said that Guliford told her the children \u201cwere bored\" and \"we ran out of things to do,\u201d according to documents.\n\nScott said she then sent Guliford and Dailey home, called the Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline and completed an incident report, according to the state's documents. Guliford and Dailey were then fired.\n\nThe Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said they received information about the incident from the day care on Dec. 8, 2016.\n\nDocuments show that two unidentified children were interviewed and said the teachers had allowed them to play with \"Hulk Hands,\" large, green gloves, and fight each other.\n\n\u201cIt happened a lot of times,\u201d one unidentified child said, according to the report.\n\nGuliford also admitted to having the kids fight, according to state documents, saying, \"I meant for the fighting with the Hulk Hands to be a stress release exercise.\"\n\n\u201cIt did not last more than three or four minutes...No children got hurt but it was still a bad judgment call on my part,\u201d Guliford said, adding she had taken the children to the lower floor of the building because of a broken heating system on the other floors.\n\nThe Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services conducted an investigation upon learning of the incident, according to a statement released by the agency to ABC News. Charges were not filed at the time.\n\n\"The Section for Child Care Regulation\u2019s report concluded that licensing rules were violated and requested that the facility take additional steps to ensure staff were trained and knowledgeable about age-appropriate activities for children. The facility completed the corrective measures in April 2017,\" the department said.\n\nMerseal is seeking $25,000 in damages in a civil suit against the facility.\n\nABC News' attempts to reach the day care center, Scott, Guliford and Dailey were unsuccessful.", "By the end of Monday there will be 5,200 active duty service members serving along the border in what is officially a support mission to Customs and Border Protection (CBP), but on the eve of the mid-term election President Trump continues to play the deployment as a campaign issue.\n\nInterested in Donald Trump? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\n\"I noticed all that beautiful barbed wire going up today,\" Trump said at a Montana campaign rally on Sunday. \"Barbed wire used properly can be a beautiful sight.\"\n\nAlfredo Estrella/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe president was referring to active duty soldiers placing concertina wire near a Texas border crossing over the weekend. The move was in line with the support mission to Customs and Border Protection being provided by U.S. Northern Command.\n\nBut on Monday Trump made it sound as if the active-duty troops assigned to Operation Faithful Patriot would play a more visible role.\n\n\"Barbed wire looks like it's going to be very effective, too, with soldiers standing in front of it,\" Trump told a campaign rally in Cleveland.\n\nBut Operation Faithful Patriot is intended to be a mission where the active duty troops are only to provide support for CBP since they are forbidden by federal law to carry out law enforcement duties.\n\nGen. Joseph Dunford restated the mission's intent in remarks at Duke University on Monday evening.\n\n\"There is no plan for U.S. military forces to be involved in the actual mission of denying people entry to the United States,\" said Dunford. \"There is no plan for the soldiers to come in contact with immigrants or to reinforce the Department of Homeland Security as they are conducting their mission. We are providing enabling capability.\"\n\nTo that end, engineering and construction units will build vehicle barriers and fencing along the points of entry along the border, as well as build temporary housing for CBP personnel being sent to the border, Helicopter units are also being deployed to transport CBP personnel to hard to reach border areas, officials said.\n\nA Pentagon spokesman said Monday that the laying of concertina wire was in line with the mission to help CBP \"plug gaps\" at ports of entry along the border.\n\n\"They tell us what points are vulnerable,\" said Col. Rob Manning.\n\nSpc. Hosannah Vickery\n\nPresident Trump last week also backtracked on comments that raised questions about when military forces might be authorized to shoot their weapons.\n\n\u201cThey want to throw rocks at our military, our military is going to fight back \u2026 we will consider that a firearm\u201d he had said on Thursday.\n\nTrump changed his stance the following day.\n\n\"They do that with us, they're going to be arrested, there's going to be problems. I didn't say shoot. I didn't say shoot. But they do that with us, they're going to be arrested for a long time. We will arrest them,\u201d he told reporters who had asked for clarification.\n\nThe Pentagon acknowledges that military service members have the right of self-defense, but does not make public the standards for the use of force other than to say they are proportional.\n\nCol. Manning declined to discuss a hypothetical situation with reporters on Monday. However, he clarified that only military policemen would be armed along the border as they provide force protection to other military units.\n\nThe Pentagon estimates that by the end of Monday there will be 5,200 active duty forces in Arizona, California and Texas with that number rising to more than 7,000 in coming days.\n\nThe majority of the forces are currently in Texas where 2,600 service members have arrived over the last week, there are 1,100 service members in Arizona and California respectively.\n\nThose numbers will rise to more than 7,000 over coming days.\n\nConstruction units have begun building temporary tent housing for military units at some of the large bases serving as staging areas.\n\nSpc. Keion Jackson\n\nLast week, President Trump described \"massive cities of tents\" being built by the military that he said would house migrants seeking asylum. But military officials emphasized that the temporary tents were only to house additional CBP personnel being sent to the border.\n\nHowever, ABC News has learned that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had made an initial request to the Pentagon \u201cto hold\u201d migrants seized along the border in tent structures, according to a U.S. official.\n\nThe initial DHS request was not accepted early on by the Pentagon and was not forwarded up the chain of command for approval.\n\nThe official noted that the request was different than a previously approved DHS request from earlier this year to house migrant families further along in the immigration process, on military bases.\n\nReuters was first to report that the Pentagon had balked at the initial request from the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAsked about the Reuters report Manning declined to comment on internal deliberations between the Department of Defense \"and our interagency partners\". Captain Bill Speaks, another Pentagon spokesman added, \"we have not received a request from DHS to build facilities to house migrant families.\"\n\nTrump said last week he plans to build tents to house migrants, who would be held in those facilities while the U.S. government weighs their asylum request.\n\nManning also clarified that Military Police (MP's) will be the only active duty forces to be armed during the operation. MP units have been assigned to the border mission to provide force protection to the units that will be providing logistical support to CBP.\n\nThere is still no official cost estimate made public for the 45-day mission, but Manning said the Defense Department will \"absorb\" the costs of the operation.\n\n\u201cThe costs are being determined by our Comptroller and when we are in a position to provide them, we will do that,\u201d said Manning.", "Transcript for Single mother in Iowa comes forward as Powerball winner\n\nFinally tonight here, it's always nice when the person who wins one of those giant jackpots seems so deserving.

There are more women running for office than ever before, early voting totals are shattering midterm records and Democrats are working against the odds to take back control of the House.\n\nABC News\u2019 Political Director Rick Klein and Chief White House and Washington Correspondent Jon Karl spoke with Deputy Political Director MaryAlice Parks and Senior National Correspondent Terry Moran about what to expect on Tuesday on this week's Powerhouse Politics Podcast.\n\nTopics like health care, immigration and tax reform have dominated debates and national rhetoric. The true test, though, will be if Democrats can garner enough support for voters to show up at the polls.\n\nEarly voting totals have been historically high for a midterm and voter registration has been up among minorities and youth voters, which could help Democrats in Texas, namely Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who is running to unseat incumbent GOP Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nReuters, FILE\n\n\u201cWhat can we learn, if anything, about where this vote is coming from? Just even the fact of it being so much, is it simply a matter that early votes have expanded?\u201d Karl asked.\n\n\u201cEarly voting has surpassed total vote from four years ago,\u201d Parks said. \u201cTexas, you have to remember, was 50 out of 50 in voter turnout four years ago. They could only go up ... but we don\u2019t know where these ballots are going.\u201d\n\nTurnout isn\u2019t just high for Democrats. Unusually steep totals for Republicans, Democrats and Independents have surged this year, all propelled by voting for or against President Trump and his policies.\n\n\u201cThis is not a conventional moment, so conventional wisdom doesn\u2019t seem right for this moment. There\u2019s so many things that are pushing this in unconventional ways,\u201d Klein said. \u201cPart of it is the engagement of voters that traditionally haven\u2019t been engaged before. Part of it is President Trump, part of it is the fact that he has a strong economy to run on -- that\u2019s unusual.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis first midterm, at this check-in moment, to have these different forces converge in different ways, to have the different loud landscape for the House and the Senate. It really stretches our ability to look into the future, because all we can do in looking at polls and making forecasts is what\u2019s happened in the past,\u201d Klein said.\n\nUnusual events which have dominated national attention, such as the contentious confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, have allowed Trump to re-frame the election, Moran said. The #MeToo movement, health care and immigration issues all touch on how many Americans see themselves reflected in politics.\n\nJeff Roberson/AP\n\n\u201cI think he changed the election so that now it\u2019s a verdict, yes, on him and his performance in office, but more on what he stands for and how he\u2019s trying to move American politics from a less pragmatic perspective to these issues of identity,\u201d Moran said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the American voters are going to deliver their verdict on.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, Americans are still looking for major changes, and Democrats have been able to argue that they are the outsiders, Parks said. Some of these candidates are running in suburban districts which have historically been red. Those races may give Democrats the margins they need to flip the House blue.\n\n\u201cWill Donald Trump have cost Republicans this slice of the electorate for a long time, because of the way they\u2019ve engaged suburban voters, women voters primarily, college-educated white people that for a long time have had their instincts on the Republican side,\u201d Klein said. \u201cWe know that Trump is going to do well, and the Republicans are going to do well in deep-red parts of the country...but it\u2019s remarkable to me how you can look across the map and say this could be a wave.\u201d\n\nEvery Wednesday, ABC Radio and iTunes bring you the Powerhouse Politics Podcast which includes headliner interviews and in-depth looks at the people and events shaping U.S. politics.

Tonight, Tallahassee major Andrew Gillum is hoping to become Florida's first democratic governor in 24 years. A true Progressive, endorsed by former president Obama and Bernie Sanders, Gillum would also be the first black governor in state history. His opponent, Republican congressman Ron Desantis, hand-picked by president trump early on. Seen in this campaign ad using toy blocks to build trump's wall with his daughter. Build the wall! Reporter: But the race has been ugly from the start, including accusations of racism. I'm not calling Mr. Desantis a racist, I'm simply saying the racists believe he's a racist. Reporter: The Republican then taking aim at Gillum, pointing to the feds looking into corruption in Tallahassee. The fact of the matter is, he has not served honorably as the mayor. Reporter: The other big race in the senate, the incumbent Democrat bill Nelson facing a tough challenge from Republican governor Rick Scott, who's maintained president trump's support, despite their differences on several key issues.

We're on the eve of a crucial midterm election here in America. The polls razor thin tonight, and president trump knows it. Telling supporters, pretend I'm on the ballot. In so many ways, this will be a referendum on the president. The stakes are enormous. And just take a look at what will be decided, as we bring the capitol to life right here in our studio tonight. All 435 seats in the house are up for voting, and 35 seats in the senate. That's a little more than a third of the senate up for grabs. Voters in 36 states will elect governors. And two numbers to watch as we head into election night. 23 seats in the house, that's what Democrats need to take back control. They also need two seats in the senate, if they want to take control there, but that's going to be a very difficult task. With so many Democrats playing defense, trying to keep their jobs, up for election in states president trump won. It's impossible to predict, of course, how this will go, but look at this tonight. At least 36 million Americans have already voted in early voting this midterm, that dwarfs the last midterm at this point, just 20 million voted then.

Reporter: Urged by party leaders to focus on what they think is his strongest selling point, president trump is now talking up jobs and the economy. Republicans have created the best economy in the history of our country. Reporter: But the core of the president's closing argument is not hope, it's fear -- dark warnings about illegal immigration. Democrats are inviting caravan after caravan -- isn't that nice? -- Of illegal aliens to flood into our country and overwhelm your communities. Reporter: There's no evidence Democrats having anything to do with the caravans of migrants fleeing violence and poverty, and they are more than 600 miles from the border. You think we're letting that caravan come into this country? You can forget it. Reporter: And now, just hours before polls open, the president is raising the specter of a stolen election. There are a lot of people, a lot of people, in my opinion, and based on proof, that try and get in illegally and actually vote illegally. Reporter: But there's been no evidence of widespread voter fraud, and the president hasn't offered any. In fact, in 2016, \"The Washington post\" could only find four documented cases in the entire presidential election. President Obama, stumping for Democrats, has taken aim at president trump's falsehoods. Unlike some people, I don't just make stuff up when I'm talking. I got facts to back me up. Reporter: President trump is drawing large and enthusiastic crowds, but he's acknowledges anything can happen tomorrow. But who knows, right? Who knows? You've got to get out to vote. But who knows, the president says. He seems to know that anything can happen tomorrow night. Jon Karl with us here tonight. The president clearly knows this is a referendum on him. Reporter: Well, he's been explicit about it. Vote for me as if I'm on the ballot. A fascinating interview that just came in he did with Sinclair broadcasting, he was asked if he had any regrets over the past two years, and he said, quote, I would say tone. I would like to have had a softer tone. And he added, he maybe had no choice because of how Democrats were talking about him, but he added again, I could have been softer. Tone on the eve of the election. Reporter: Especially given the way he's ending this campaign. Jon, thank you.

ABC's Steve osunsami and so many of our teams out across the country tonight. Steve has the state of the race in Georgia. Reporter: Democrat Stacey Abrams' final pitch to become the nation's first black female governor has her getting out the vote in rural Georgia tonight. If every eligible Georgian in the state votes, then we will win this election. Reporter: If she wins tomorrow, Democrats everwhere will be studying her campaign, because Abrams has been preaching to the Progressive choir, talking gun control and subsidized health care, not at all trying to convince hard conservatives. And she has no worries bringing in out of towners like Oprah Winfrey to knock on doors. They said, \"I have her cell number.\" I go, \"Give it to me.\" I'm going to call her up right now. So I called Stacey Abrams, and I said, \"Stacey, this is Oprah.\" You know what she said? She said, \"Girl, let me pull over to the side of the road.\" Reporter: Republican Brian Kemp has the blessing of the president. This race is a battle for the soul of our state. Reporter: Kemp is ignoring repeated calls for him to resign from his day job as secretary of state, where he supervises state elections. Over the weekend, Kemp, in his official role, launched an investigaton into state Democrats, accusing them of hacking into state voter registrations without any evidence. I'm not worried about how it looks. I'm doing my job. He is abusing his power. He is both the candidate, he is the elector and he's the guardian of the system. That is wrong. Reporter: Abrams says Kemp's office is still sitting on thousands of registrations from minority voters. And Steve osunsami joins us live tonight from Atlanta. And Steve, this is a close election, might not end tomorrow night, in fact. Reporter: Yes, there's a very real possibility of a runoff election. To win tomorrow, someone has to get to 50% of the vote, and there is a third candidate, a libertarian candidate in this race. And right now, this race is very, very tight. If no one wins a simple majority, a runoff will be scheduled in December. David? All right, huge stakes on both sides. Steve, thank you.

The two senate candidates both in their 40s, one ran for president, the other could run one day. Senator Ted Cruz and three-time congressman Beto O'rourke could not be more different. Overnight, we were with Cruz in his final push. You look at the Texas economy right now. The economy is booming. We've got the lowest unemployment rate in 49 years.

Paula, we know that Beto O'rourke is from El Paso. He likes to talk about the safety of El Paso, with all this talk of the caravans. Reporter: That's right, David. And the Mexican border is just a half mile from where we are. O'rourke tells me that the city of El Paso has been one of the safest cities in 20 years.

For Democrats to take control of the house, they need 23 seats. It's a big if, but if they're able to pull that off, what are the three things you'll be watching? Reporter: Democrats are going to put the trump administration under an intense microscope. The first thing I'm watching, the investigations. They are going to demand to see president trump's tax returns. They're going to dig into conflicts of interest to questions about possible Russia collusion. Second thing to keep an eye on, Robert Mueller. Democrats are likely to take steps to try to protect the special counsel. The third issue is impeachment. Don't expect Democrats to bring that up much. They want to see what the special counsel has discovered. They want to know what Robert Mueller has. In the meantime, if Democrats pull this off in the house, much harder in the senate, so many democratic senators defending their seats in red seats that trump won, but in the house, it's not a guarantee it would be madame speaker with Nancy Pelosi.

He faces a maximum sentence of eight years in prison, according to the statement.\n\nBennett, a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and Australia, had claimed that Hellman fell from the 40-foot catamaran while they were sailing. He was arrested in February in Miami and charged with murder after the FBI found evidence that discredited his story. The couple has a 1-year-old daughter together.\n\nFind Isabella/Facebook\n\nThe couple set sail on their honeymoon aboard a vessel named \"Surf Into Summer\" from St. Maarten in April 2017, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nOn May 14, 2017, the newlyweds departed Cuba for Florida on the catamaran, and about 8 p.m. that evening, Bennett had Hellman take control of the vessel for the night watch but did not instruct her to wear a life jacket, harness or personal locator beacon, the statement read.\n\nBennett, who was asleep in a cabin below deck, was awoken by a loud noise early the next morning, and when he climbed onto the exterior of the boat, he saw that the sails and rigging were loose but his wife was not there, according to officials.\n\nHe couldn't remember if he had called out to Hellman, but he did not deploy flares to illuminate the area to look for her or to signal his position in the open water for safety or recovery, the statement read. Bennett also did not search for Hellman, either with the catamaran or a dinghy, and did not activate any emergency equipment or use the satellite phone to signal or call for help, officials said.\n\n\"Bennett ultimately abandoned the vessel and boarded the life raft,\" the statement read.\n\nBroward Sheriff\n\nBefore he boarded the raft, he loaded various items onto it, including a suitcase, two duffel bags, a backpack, water, unexpended parachute flames, a radio transmitter, buoys, food and silver coins, according to the DOJ.\n\nBennett told investigators he gathered his personal belongings when he noticed that the vessel was taking on water, according to a criminal complaint filed when he was arrested.\n\nHe is an \"experienced sailor\" and had received certification from the Royal Yachting Association in the United Kingdom as a coastal skipper, the training of which includes instruction on emergency procedures, such as man overboard protocols and night sailing safety, officials said. Hellman was not trained in emergency sailing procedures and had \"substantially less sailing experience,\" the statement read.\n\n\"Bennet also had hands-on sailing experience on the open water for extended periods of time, including a three-month voyage from St. Maarten to Australia,\" officials said.\n\nWhen Bennett left the catamaran, it and the attached dinghy were \"inoperable,\" the DOJ said, adding that it has evidence from expert testimony \"that the catamaran was intentionally scuttled.\"\n\nU.S. Coast Guard District 7, FILE\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard received an emergency alert from Bennett when he was about 26 nautical miles west of Cay Sal Bank in the Bahamas, officials said. He was ultimately rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter, which transported him to the Marathon Jet Center in Marathon, Florida.\n\nThe Coast Guard used ships, planes and helicopters to comb over nearly 5,000 square miles over the following days but suspended the search on May 18, 2017.\n\n\"To date, Ms. Hellman has not been found and has not contacted any of her family,\" officials said. \"Based on all evidence, Ms. Hellman is dead.\"\n\nThe expert testified that Bennett's story about Hellman vanishing after the catamaran hit something in open waters couldn't be true after examining photos and video the Coast Guard took of the catamaran before and after it sank.\n\nHellman died as a result of \"Bennett's knowledge of circumstances that existed that could have reasonably enabled him to foresee the threat of life to which his acts or failures to act might subject another, namely Ms. Hellman; and his gross negligence, amounting to wanton and reckless disregard for human life,\" according to the DOJ.\n\nBennett had been working as a realtor in South Florida and married Hellman in February 2017, according to court documents.\n\nInvestigators believed Bennett killed his wife in order to collect on an insurance policy and take sole possession of their marital assets, including bank accounts and a home she owned in Delray Beach, Florida, according to court documents when he was first arrested. He also raised suspicions when asking the Coast Guard for a \"letter of presumed death\" on the day they called off the search for her, according to the complaint.\n\nThe day Bennett was arrested was the same day Hellman's parents and sisters sent a letter to a federal judge complaining that he had kept them away from the couple's daughter, Emilia.\n\n\"We do not want to say anything bad about Lewis, but we would like him to know how much it hurts us not to be able to see and spend time with our granddaughter and niece, Emilia, since he took her out of the country,\" the family wrote in the letter obtained by ABC News. \"Lewis knows that Isabella's mother was very much involved in caring for Emilia from the time of her birth here in Florida until she was lost at sea.\"\n\nFederal officials said Bennett will now be held accountable for his wife's death.\n\n\"Although nothing can ever erase the pain and suffering caused by Lewis Bennett\u2019s criminal acts, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and our law enforcement partners hope that the defendant\u2019s admission of guilt is a step toward justice for the victim, Ms. Isabella Hellman, and her family,\" Orshan said. \"The federal government remains committed to the safety and security of our U.S. citizens, whether they are at home in South Florida or traveling on the high seas.\"\n\nIn November, Bennett pleaded guilty to unrelated charges of transporting $5,000 in gold and silver coins, according to the complaint.\n\nABC News could not immediately reach Bennett's federal public defender, Vanessa Chen, for comment.\n\nThe Hellman family plans to speak at Bennett's sentencing, their attorney, Mitchell Kitroser, told the Sun Sentinel.\n\nABC News' Michael Edison Hayden, Bill Hutchinson and Emily Shapiro contributed to this report.", "Transcript for DNA, genetic genealogy led police to suspected killer in Maryland cold case\n\nFor nearly a decade policing and a run of county were stopped by a fatal shooting that left more than its fair share of evidence no killer.

Team room New York edition final countdown to Election Day great to have you with us today and joined by the political brain trusts of ABC news political director Rick Klein deputy political director. Ellison parks in the great Matt Dowd is here at ABC news theater great to have you guys all with us. Here we are the final hours everybody is anxiously awaiting. And to be results tomorrow the record turnout already in the early vote. I'm one of the places that were most closely watching. Is Georgia. That's worst evo since Johnny has been on the trail in this final stretch the governor's race there. One of the hottest of the season and Steve and there has been a dramatic twist again. In this race over voting rights and allegations of voter suppression and now. Allegations of hacking and bring us up to speed on on the latest and that. That twist in that race. So that the current secretary of state Brian camp is also running for governor on Saturday. Announced that he believes that the Democratic Party hacked into state. Voter rolls but were unsuccessful he gave very little evidence about how that happened but it was a giant accusation. Which the Democrats deny 100%. And accuse. Cam actually trying to pull off a political stunt. Two G and the Republican Party. Just hours now before the election camp. Went further than just the accusation saying that he's now contacted. The FBI to investigate this. We've reached out to federal authorities they are not confirming that they're looking into this at this point and have no comment but it's a huge. Accusation that's coming just hours now before the election and it's got everyone talking about whether or not this is true. SI understand it how this happened was a voter who identified a vulnerability. With the state web site. Notified democratic Democrat party officials who then shared this with the secretary of State's office. And somehow this became the Democratic Party trying to hack into state voter rolls. At the rally that camp appeared out with the president yesterday south of Atlanta and Macon Georgia neither of the two made any mention of this. And I will say DeVon there's one point that we have to underline and all of this criticism against. The secretary of state they are he is facing mounting pressure to resign or at least step aside from this election. Because during his day job his official duty is to monitor. Elections which people here on both sides actually say is of huge conflict of interest and saves. Casey Abrams the Democrat was on Good Morning America this morning she said this whole thing is cooked. Op. At the last minute certainly. Smells of politics on both sides in these back and forth that allegations. What's your read there you've been a longtime Georgia resident. Of how this is playing with voters is they've many of the Marty made up their minds and will giving this have any impact. I think it will I actually and I think it's working I think that. What we're seeing in this election here which we haven't seen as much in previous elections for governor. Is he you have both sides speaking to their base. Preaching to the choir. And what Brian camp has done in this whether or not these accurate accusations are true or not which they do. Appear to be somewhat manipulated. Putting it kindly. Is that many of his supporters will be more motivated to vote because of this. There is also a flip side to this point something that was spread around over the weekend there were these racist robo calls. That were sent into voters' homes over the weekend. Making fun of Oprah Winfrey who was here last week. Campaigning for Abrams. One of them referring to her as aunt Jemima. Those robo calls are indeed fact those did happen and they have the same net effect in terms of their influence on voters here. On each side is trying to get their voters to the polls this is about turnout. And one of that one of the one of the campaigns over the weekend had a conference call where they shared. That about six they believe about 65%. Of Democrats have voted so far and early voting and about 55%. Of Republicans. This is all about turnout the polls right now put this as a very close race within the margin of various bearer whoever gets the most voters to the polls. Of their people get more of their people to doubles the polls on Tuesday wins. Artsy but since Tommy we know you be stand on the case tomorrow night and are part of our live team coverage thank you so much Steve for that report. That I was struck it was in Georgia yesterday with the president. And struck how much this race he's. Is racially tinged it's in all the conversation you have with voters on both sides. I'm happy to be at the trump rally for most the day also talked to some Democrats and all of them. Brought up the issue of race in this debate. Well this is that state it's obviously from the old confederacy that has changed on the history if that but it's changed dramatically in the course of the last twenty years and it's now a state. If it's not purple yet it's getting to purple which is why this race has become incredibly competitive and the difference between Atlanta and the suburbs in the rest. The state is dramatic I mean it's speaking directly to this I mean this would to me is the definition of a conflict of interest the guy camp runs this state elections. He makes this allegation of in from a place where he actually runs from about a race. For the chief executive of the state that he's running for. Come seems completely conflicted than. It's not just the the voting system he oversees malice but you've been covering these voter registrations 50000 of them that have been put on hold and. It's worth pointing out that so a mat saying he's the referee as well as one team. And he's the one that should have any evidence of an issue and yet he's not producing any evidence he's just making an accusation and that I think is not gonna go over very well. But I but what's a thinner at the end it seems a little bit. Tried and true and it's all I cannot turn out but it's really true and George up because she hasn't run to the middle. Seizing arms is not trying to win over moderates are Republicans she's trying to build out the party in Georgia and bring new Democrats in the table. Yet and I think. When you see in this race and a handful of others just a clear dissolution of the choices. The president has gone out and run a very misleading campaign to try to frame choices and false ways I actually think in George up. Florida and Texas you're seeing a clean contrast presented by the candidates themselves than. That offer that often that route is raise the stakes of what we already know is going to be a record smashing election. And this and keep in mind that this it I mean obviously this is a very close race that we're all going to be watching tomorrow night because of the historic. If CC a reverse to African American governor to win Maris but it's going to be incredibly close and it we may go into a runoff if neither side gets 50%. But there's also had some key can grab a key congressional race that that even if she loses by virtue of her turnout may have changed that race as well. A lot to watch in Georgia hey you know spending the day there as they were saying a lot of racially tinged conversation but also. A lot of focus on immigration among Republicans I was struck by. The number of Republicans said their top issue this election granted this is at a trump rally is the caravan in rural Georgia of all places. Thousands of miles from the border they were talking about the caravan. And that is were Marcus Moore is right now with these traveling migrants of poor and impoverished many Hondurans Mexicans traveling up to the US forward the president has made a part of this campaign Marcus. Out tell us where you are now and what's happening there today. Well DeVon good afternoon to you this caravan has made it to Mexico City the capital. Of this country and I just behind do you concede. The other people who are lined up to get booed here at this a sports complex. That has been turned into a shelter a refuge. For the up thousands of migrants have been in the midst of this out this caravan. This is an area where just last week they helped evict a Formula One race was that huge international event where thousands of people show up is also concerts that are held here. And Dick's sporting events and I bring that up. Because it is the place that cannot handle a lot of people. And we talk about this caravan we're talking literally about thousands of people who this afternoon. Have found refuge here at this out this exports complex in Kansas in Mexico City. And I wanted to get off in the distance there were people are getting clothing. This is where a lot of people have been. Recoup rating again and refreshments. And I do want to talk to a one of them migrants. Who we met along the way David Mendoza and he's from El Salvador and David. A you made it here to Mexico City yesterday. How how important and you thought it was to it to make it here to Mexico City and why. Oh I think this is really important for all look the people you because. Is the boat did did Disney where they can update. It about this because what you're gonna go to either to what border either to. You know tour saw Texas or California. Absolutely MM in Seoul as we've described this as a fork in the road this is where where people like David and families would decide. You know whether or not they will stay here in Mexico perhaps or continue north and I do want to askew Davis. I've heard that that that some people have heard some of the things the president trump has set and they also know about the soldiers at the border. And because of that they don't want to go to the US any more because they don't but like it will be safe. Is that is that how you feel or be used to wanna go to the. No no no I was already thinking in. Well when I got the party I knew that I wasn't gonna go back because I got punished for ten years. Somewhat the way the state you're here in Mexico. In and not because trump and the Marines in America's and that's because. No I want a father though what they told me you know the rules. About the way the ten years here Mexico. So you wanna do it the right way yes the legal that legal way via. And so so there you go a DeVon hearing from David thank you very much for your time appreciate it. And David one of the many of migrants who we've met along the way who says he wants to make it to the US but he wants to do the right way and because of the rules have to wait so are we here. Here to do that David thank you it's good to see you com. DeVon I want to Saudi around just a little bit because I can tell you that that the mood here is very different we've been to a number of towns where the Mike where the migrant. I caravan has come to a stop for the day. And here in Mexico City. It is much more relaxed if it is very column here. And much more festive if you will and we show you very quickly. No have a lot of time markets that you're doing let let me ask you if you can hear me they give us a sense of located on your Hoffa how far away are they from. From the US Texas border is that we talking days weeks months. We're yet we're talking. At the rate they've been going we're talking weeks dampened absolutely weeks. Companies whose properties in it was typical. Yes yes. We're talking weeks worth of about a thousand miles away from the nearest port of injury. Into the into the United States and that would be Texas on the Reynosa area the Holocaust. Let's take a look at what you can see around the but the people here does look somebody entertainment. That they are trying to give the out migrants here who have been in the midst of a very long journey. And out this the first I've seen of entertainment for the for the adults we've seen it DeVon for the children. And of it's certainly gives you a sense of this being a major milestone for them on this journey. And in fact you're asking about how far away they are from the US Mexico border there are people here who are thinking they'll stay in Mexico City here at this shelter. At least for the next few days as they figure out what their next steps will be and there are a number of agencies here to help them not figure that out. All right Marcus Moore force in Mexico traveling with the caravan of migrants thank you so much for that Marcus you've been under tremendous job down there. You know I'm struck by how much this is in our consciousness can headed into tomorrow and how quickly it seems almost everybody that watches politics closely thinks this will go away. After tomorrow and then in the conversation do you do you I buy that. This is this is only let the president simply is fixated on but but for the fact. Election Day is tomorrow there is I don't think there's any possible way troops would have been sent two months earlier seven weeks early to the border in order make some demonstration of strength. And the reality evidence as he it was shown. This is actually a humanitarian problem this isn't a invading. Group a horde of people with guns that are coming to storm the border it's a humanitarian problem that each country they pass through has tried to deal with in this. I actually think the calculation of political calculation. And Rick and I were just talking. We're not gonna know until tomorrow night as the results come in. But I think for every base voter that trump thinks by doing this he's Costa have more passion and go vote. He's actually offended. 22 independent voters by doing it because I think most of the independent voters in the country we're gonna decide this election look at this assays are poor people are starving people I don't see a criminal element. I don't see this. Let's treat them humanely this figure a way to secure our border do that we'll know tomorrow night but from my sense of things and watching the polls and all of that I see no. Movement to the present and movement to the Republicans in the course it. And speaking of tone in speaking of turning off independent voters women voters there is a new act that president from. Has been running that's been gaining some extraordinary blow back furry its treatment of immigrants let's take a look I think we just have. A little snip of it. About Nolan. The war. We have a lot of ads. And they certainly are effective based on the numbers that we're say. A lot of things are offensive. Your questions or offensive a lot of times I get out. And I think you seem. Do the two parties make a play to do two different Americas here at the close. They may both be right you can see the situation we're Democrats take the house Republicans holder to expand into joining the senate. Because of the same set of messaging because of the same president at the top of the ticket and because these issues hit. But as Matthew says it's a big gamble because we don't know what this electorates want to look like we think. We have we have some indications about it being younger and more diverts and larger than a typical ms. from electorate. But if we're talking about an election that the truly changes that connect plea to the base will not end up being a Smart one it's on its sacrifices of the house and may even jeopardize. Some other potential Republican pick ups in the senate. Speaking of public a program like I was gonna say Brad are scale who was the one in charge of this and who president Trump's campaign manager his campaign manager after 20/20. Who's never run a campaign before. Tweeted out this this afternoon saying he was offended by the fact that MSNBC NBC FaceBook and now Fox News won't run the ad. So I treated at him I say listen I don't I know you're not might not be familiar with this. But -- have to contain both facts and they can't be racist so in the future. You might want to do I respond decade he did respond Arafat from the but I think that's the problem is is is factually incorrect was both factually incorrect as they told the story that's fundamentally wasn't true about what the Democrats did or didn't do in this. And for most people are watch the and it felt. Clearly racist and one of the places that is tracking immigrant sentiment tracking the president's adds certainly is Texas. Everything's bigger in Texas I think in the turnout there certainly has been take a look at some of these graphics. About the turnout in Texas mats from Texas he can attest to this we have some of the numbers just in. Extraordinary. Levels of early voting they have surpassed. All of us to between fourteen the last mid term voting total total already in total total vote in early vote is exceeded total vote. In the voting continues our Paula Ferris is there she's been tracking. Voter turnout and of course that he senate race Ted Cruz better or worked for Democrat. Paula. There she is. Oh my on how do you feel the I don't like men against spots I'm in new York and you're standing in front of the lone star flag this you know right. I I actually feel like I'm CNN and the sun is so hot right now but you guys this is a hot race. And Matt you know this better than anybody any dis should've been a slam dunk race for tanker is this particular seat has been read. Since 1988. Or since Ted Cruz was seventeen. I'm not could indict any of us as to how well we were back in 1988 but. No tonight at the demographics are changing here. In the state of Texas I spoke with Ted Cruz and he's not taking anything for granted he believes that the momentum. Is on his side right now and he says he's confident that if his people show up to the polls. He will prevail take a lesson. I think momentum is very much with us mercy and record turn giant is great but we always an apartment to show they were ticked off. This election was all about. Ordinary text shown up don't know about some were seen. In and you look at that enthusiasm that the bedrooms person to deals which was seen all the tax system fair do you think that early voter momentum. Is leaning your way but I do. Tom this was all about getting. Texans to focus on this race and focus on the issues you know two months ago. Every other day we had these media profiles that were. Just puff pieces they were all puppy dogs and rains and in the last two months on the back till O'Rourke yes yes and an end and the national media was in love with. Because he was running hard left campaign is running away Bernie Sanders was born campaign. A lot of national borders Exide. But it's not what people texts can. Sick sick Devin you wrap up the numbers here the early voting numbers which today that the numbers are just mind boggling five million. What an early which surpassed the total amount and 2014 he would think that those numbers would lean towards that tell work he's running a really strong ground game. He's been president and campus says he's targeting young voters minority voters and a Tel 254. Counties I was surprised when I was. At the attack that Ted Cruz rally last that he talks about the enthusiasm. And I spoke to somebody overflow crowd he says this is the type of thing we're seen consistently at our rallies people can't get and since he said don't dismiss our enthusiasm and and I asked. Damn how many of them voted early take a listen. Our so as an alien act would happen. People. And a rally I'm talking probably fifty people out we haven't now here you go. Critics Ted Cruz rally could hear raise your hand if you voted early. All of a pretty much all of you voted early this. Okay why did you utterly. Don't mind a certain why did you what did you apparently does it. Mark words. Anger anybody else can't why did you vote early streets rails they should be loans. Right I used it Friday how many people have come to the polls early surprises in record numbers now. There's a lot on and each other's. That. And needs to candidates. Edu that they couldn't be any more different in personality and policy. Ted Cruz is going out there on the stock and he's preteen job security and freedom con verse late better O'Rourke. Is pre teen health care. Dreamers and no while A vis the guys are literally night and day different. But about O'Rourke was in Houston this morning he and has just and it running a breakneck speed he was at a rally. And he talked about the enthusiasm that were seen so far in terms of the early to Gillis and. In his stated she's in rent and did dead last in the country in order for now. Yeah where our democracy less than anyone else. After 100% on purpose behind us. The most alternative station. Kind of song we brought. Obama and congressional district solely based on their race or their ethnicity. Shenzhen. Those errors those obstacles remain short it counted at all. He's got up and he counted. So that was Houston now he's headed to Dallas and then tonight he's going to be here at a campus at bag you tap which says. Where is gonna hold his final rally as he makes his final push and then he's going to be watching the returns come in. That stadium here tomorrow night in Al paso as well but. I talk to both of these candidates. They're both exhausted they're ready to cross the finish cited both admit this taking a tour on their mailing me have young children and that as for Ted Cruz he's going to be watching those returns tomorrow ratings used and which is eleven hours awake. Matt Dowd I had no idea how large the status. By the way he really didn't give me any sort of forewarning if you if you listen country in an avid self. Yeah so paso in your car and drove to Beaumont it would take you eighteen hours. And it got this yeah. I don't. And that's some that's what's remarkable about the race and you can understand the pure exhaustion at these guys are feeling as at this point you know particularly bad overwork who has canvas and Criss cross its latest have a voice anywhere but tankers to me he's having. Safety town halls and just the last couple of weeks at these guys. Are gone for it. We'll see what happens my night. All right Paula Harrison Texas we know you're there to the finish Paula thank you so much for that it is it is extraordinary scene is playing out attacks you know. I admit my age just something TK because she said 198827. Years old then and I was running Lloyd Bentsen's campaign it was a Democrat. Was a Latin with took their one net seat then resigned to become. Bill Clinton's trip as secretary of treasury and that the last time that seeing what's behind this what's behind this turnout is in a better or effect does this trump a fact what what do you it has asked the whole environment I think it's AH I think it's a combination of a better off lights less trop. It's a better when Ted effect. And that Ted was always. Vulnerable in this race because after his presidential campaign his numbers were low in Texas he was vulnerable in a red state but a red state that's trending towards lighter red and ultimately. We'll be purple because of the growth in Latino population so it's ten was vulnerable. Because of how we spend perceived as state. But also expect -- run a campaign it's been aspiration only in many ways and turned on the question I think comes down to I think the race will be close I think it's still favors Ted. In this but I think it's going to be really close. Is ten Bechtel. He's gonna turn out a whole bunch of people into turmoil which in new people. Is can he get enough of them white vote in Texas in order overcome I can see you getting to 45% of the vote has bets or 46% of the vote. Can you get the last 45%. Of the vote. It's almost all going to be among white suburban mothers. The fascinating. To watch you know you're obese keeping your close eye and Texas tomorrow night meanwhile. We know group of young people in this country are watching the returns come in nationwide those into the park when survivors in March for our lives kids if you will. That launched a campaign nine months ago to a list an army. Of millennial youth voters ought to vote in this campaign and by all accounts they have succeeded here we see some picture from march when they.

This going to be a man I'm amazed at what the turnouts going to be over it's probably going to be over a hundred million nationwide huge turnouts in many different places we've seen in an early vote. I'm gonna watch independence because independence how they break in already racist is gonna side. For all of our talk about immigration and according to our latest poll fifteen out of America fifty members and Americans do think it's a big issue. But seven 8% of Americans think that health care. Is a top issue so it's hard TV we don't always cover it but still people are really worried about the cost of health care and that tends to break in democrats' favor. History is being made guys we just don't know what direction it's gonna be we don't know if this is a ratification or rejection something in between we do know at this record numbers of Americans are engaging in this political process that people are dialed in. To this election season.

Add Interest\n\nIn the first of a three-state sprint to the midterm finish line, President Donald Trump continued his push for Republicans and demonizing of Democrats in Cleveland in an effort to mobilize his base on the eve of election day.\n\n\"Tomorrow, with your votes, you can stop the radical resistance in its tracks,\" Trump announced, adding that \"Tuesday is your chance to send a message to the Democrat mob and to everyone who has made it their mission to denigrate our movement and to divide our great nation.\"\n\nTrump supporters in the Buckeye state turned out in droves to hear the president's closing refrain before election day, as early voting figures across the country have already eclipsed 2014 totals in many states. But that didn't keep Trump, who has two more campaign stops in Indiana and Missouri tonight, from encouraging his supporters to get out to the polls.\n\n\"I remember with [my election], this is very much a Tuesday state. The people are sort of holding for Tuesday,\" Trump said after asking the audience whether they'd already voted. \"The midterm elections used to be, like, boring, didn't they? Who ever even heard of a midterm? Now they're, like, the hottest thing.\"\n\nOhioans overwhelmingly supported Trump in 2016, so with Republicans facing a tough slate of gubernatorial, Senate, and House races this cycle, it's no surprise the president chose to be in Cleveland on his last day of campaigning. And if there was any doubt that this election is all about Trump, he made that clear.\n\n\"In a sense, I am on the ticket,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump heaped praise on Mike DeWine, the state's current attorney general and Republican candidate for governor, who is deadlocked in a neck-and-neck race with Democrat Rich Cordray, the former director of President Obama's Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. DeWine has sought to garner support from Trump's wing of the GOP while maintaining ties with a moderate block aligned with the state's current governor, John Kasich - a frequent critic of Trump.\n\nCarlos Barria/Reuters\n\n\"He's fighting, he's great,\" Trump said of DeWine, before turning his attention toward Cordray, who he called a \"bad guy.\"\n\n\"I know his opponent -- he\u2019s a bad guy, not a good person. He\u2019s hurt a lot of people. Cordray, a bad person who will do a terrible job,\" Trump told the crowd.\n\nCordray, in a recent campaign ad, expressed a desire to do what's best for Ohioans.\n\n\"When President Trump does something that helps Ohio, I'll work with him,\" Cordray told viewers. \"But when he does something that hurts Ohio, I'll stand up to him. But Mike DeWine backs Donald Trump every single time, no matter what.\"\n\nIf Trump is trying to push DeWine over the goal line, his endorsement of Rep. Jim Renacci, a U.S. congressman challenging Democrat Sherrod Brown for a seat in the Senate, is nothing short of a Hail Mary. Polls suggest Renacci trailing Brown by a substantial figure, with 538 giving Renacci a 1 in 30 chance of winning.\n\nNevertheless, Trump hailed Renacci as \"a wonderful human being\" who has \"run a really good campaign,\" adding, \"it\u2019s not easy.\"\n\nIn addition to his kind words for Republicans on Ohio's ballot, Trump nailed his well-worn stump speech, highlighting the booming economy, bemoaning the migrant caravan and boasting of his successes in confirming two Supreme Court nominees.\n\nTrump spared a moment for his daughter, too, inviting Ivanka Trump onstage by joking with the audience that he isn't allowed to call her \"beautiful\" anymore.\n\n\"You\u2019re not allowed to use the word beautiful anymore - it\u2019s politically incorrect. So I\u2019m not allowed to say it. But she's really smart. It\u2019s my daughter Ivanka, and she\u2019s here!\" Trump announced.\n\n\"That was some introduction!\" Ivanka chided, before going on to highlight a laundry list of the administration's accomplishments.\n\nFrom Cleveland, the president takes Air Force One to Fort Wayne, Indiana, before closing out his 2018 campaign stretch in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, Monday night.\n\nIndiana\n\nLess than three hours after leaving his rally in Ohio, President Trump took the stage before nearly 13,000 supporters in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the second of his three last-day stops to boost Republican midterm turnout.\n\nThough the penultimate event largely echoed the common rally theme of depicting Democrats as an obstructionist party trying to bring chaos, while crediting Republicans with bringing order through a strong economy and strong borders, in Fort Wayne the president took time to focus on Republican Senate candidate Mike Braun.\n\n\"Tomorrow the people of Indiana are going to send Mike Braun to the U.S. Senate,\" Trump said of the businessman-turned-candidate, adding later that it would be \"a vote to keep your family safe.\"\n\nBraun is running a tight race against Democratic incumbent Sen. Joe Donnelly, this in a state where Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 19 points in 2016. The president implied Donnelly, whom he called \"an extreme liberal,\" has been pretending to support him to get votes.\n\nAaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images\n\n\"He\u2019s gone rogue on the Democrats, he\u2019s gone rogue, because now he likes Trump a lot, he loves my border policy,\" the president said. \"There\u2019s one problem,\" he added. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the election tomorrow, and on Wednesday he\u2019ll be totally against us.\"\n\nDespite Donnelly's lean to the right on some issues including immigration and bank deregulation, former President Barack Obama came to Indiana the day before Trump to campaign for him. Former Vice President Joe Biden also made the trip to support the senator in October.\n\nEven before the high-profile visits from Trump and Obama, early voting in Indiana had surpassed its 2014 total, as it has in dozens of other states. Several attendees at the Fort Wayne rally told ABC News they voted early this cycle to be sure their preference for GOP candidates would be heard, citing the Kavanaugh confirmation as well as the state of the U.S. economy and foreign policy as motivation -- all factors that could just as well motivate Democratic voters.\n\nMidway through his talk, Trump surprised the crowd by inviting White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and counselor Kellyanne Conway on stage.\n\n\"You'll have to forgive Kellyanne and I, we're maybe a little speechless -- we're not used to friendly crowds,\" Sanders said, to laughter from the crowd.\n\nSarah Sanders and Kellyanne Conway join Pres. Trump at campaign rally in Fort Wayne, Indiana. \"You'll have to forgive Kellyanne and I, we're maybe a little speechless. We're not used to friendly crowds,\" Sanders said. https://t.co/0SeyYkZhQ7 pic.twitter.com/XzM3NWubMS \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) November 5, 2018\n\nBoth women implored the audience to vote for Republican candidates, as Conway called the election a \"very personal\" matter for her.\n\n\"Elections have consequences, and your vote tomorrow is so incredibly important,\" Conway said. \"You've got to get everyone you know out to the polls tomorrow or it doesn't matter.\"\n\nDespite enjoying overwhelming support from the audience, the rally was paused three times due to protester interruption. Each time a protester was removed from the packed arena, the crowd would chant Trump's name, and Trump would tell the protester to \"go home to mommy!\"\n\n\"I haven't had one of these things happen in a long time, and I have three of them tonight,\" Trump said. \"That's Indiana for you.\"\n\nTrump ends his long string of pre-midterm rallies Monday evening in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, where pundits Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh are expected to attend.\n\nMissouri\n\nPresident Donald Trump held his 44th rally of the 2018 campaign cycle Monday night, submitting the GOP's closing message in the Show Me State, where he laid out the stakes of Tuesday\u2019s highly anticipated midterm elections.\n\n\"We have to get out tomorrow, and we have to elect a Republican Congress,\" Trump proclaimed, warning that a Democratic Congress would socialize health care.\n\nIn his third rally of the day, Trump campaigned on behalf of GOP Senate hopeful Josh Hawley, who's challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in one of the election's most closely contested races.\n\n\"Tomorrow, the people of Missouri are going to send Josh Hawley to the United States Senate to keep America's economic boom going full speed ahead,\" Trump told the crowd. \"Josh is a young, incredible guy with tremendous talent. He will represent Missouri so well, and he's actually leading.\"\n\nThe president repeatedly bashed McCaskill, asserting she \"will be a disaster for jobs, for your state.\"\n\nDespite heavy rains drenching the region Monday afternoon, thousands of Missourians packed the Show Me Center for the rally and did not let the gloomy weather dampen their enthusiasm, chanting \"four more years\" and collectively singing \"Amazing Grace\" as a woman who collapsed near the stage was tended to by emergency personnel.\n\nTrump is the first U.S. president to visit Cape Girardeau since Ronald Reagan in 1988. Trump won Missouri by 20 points in 2016.\n\n\"Go out and vote Republican tomorrow,\" said Trump, wrapping up his speech as midnight approached on the East Coast. \"This Tuesday, in 15 minutes -- we're almost into Tuesday -- I need the people of Missouri to seize this incredible moment in history.\"\n\nTrump campaigned across 22 states this year, including three stops in Missouri: Springfield, Columbia and Cape Girardeau. The president is expected to monitor election results from the White House today.\n\nABC News Live -- the network\u2019s 24/7 streaming channel for breaking news and live events -- will offer continuous and commercial-free coverage on Election Day starting at 4:30 p.m. EST on Roku, AppleTV, Amazon Fire TV, YouTube, Apple News, Facebook, Twitter and the ABC News site and mobile apps.

This allows police to create a much larger family tree than using law enforcement databases like CODIS, in which an exact match is needed in most states, according to experts.\n\nOver a dozen crimes have identified suspects this year thanks to genetic genealogy, including the April arrest of the suspected \"Golden State Killer\" -- a cold case that stumped California law enforcement for decades.\n\nOnce genetic genealogy led experts to Frampton as a possible suspect in Temple's killing, detectives then surveilled him and obtained multiple DNA samples, police said Friday.\n\nAnne Arundel County Police\n\nThe DNA collected from Frampton was found to be a match to the DNA left behind at the crime scene, police said.\n\nFrampton, of Glen Burnie, Maryland, was apprehended Thursday and arrested on multiple charges including first-degree murder, second-degree murder and armed robbery, police said.\n\nSearch warrants and interviews led authorities to identify the second suspect as Jonathan Ludwig, police said; however, Ludwig died this March.\n\nAnne Arundel County Police\n\nFrampton appeared at a bond hearing Friday and was held without bail, Anne Arundel County State's Attorney Wes Adams said.\n\nHis preliminary hearing is set for Nov. 27.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if he had an attorney.\n\nABC News' Amanda Maile contributed to this report.", "bad url", "Diwali, the Hindu festival of light, is supposed to be a time of religious celebration each fall.

And \u2026 it's scary but \u2026 you just kind of try to hold it tight and be vigilant.\u201d\n\nThe movie holds few punches in its portrait of addiction, recovery and relapse though neither Chalamet or Carell say they\u2019ve struggled with addiction personally.\n\n\u201cAddiction doesn't have a recognizable face,\u201d Chalamet said. \u201cWhat I've found \u2026 with this character was the humanity of it.\u201d\n\nThat humanity is at the heart of both Chalamet\u2019s and Carell\u2019s performances.\n\n\u201cAs a parent, all you want to do is protect your kids from day one -- and you're fearful from day one until the day you die,\u201d Carell said. \u201cYou're always going to be afraid of something bad happening to your kids \u2013 [to] watch your kids go through something like this and to spiral out of control and to be completely helpless \u2026 I think that's the part of it that's the scariest for me.\u201d\n\nThe emotional days on set took a toll on the actors.\n\n\u201cI would go home at the end of these days and want to call dad, and just say, 'I love you, we are so lucky to have each other,'\" said Chalamet.\n\nCarell said coming home to his two children and wife of 23 years, Nancy Carell, made it easier.\n\n\u201cEvery day I'd sit with my wife \u2026 and I would tell her about what we filmed during that day,\u201d Carell said. \u201cIt was good to talk about it because it does get inside of you \u2026. especially a topic like this when you're looking at your kids when you come home, and you're feeling all the things they're going through -- and you just love them so much and you pray that nothing bad ever happens to them, and you're always knocking wood.\u201d\n\nFrancois Duhamel/Amazon Studios via AP\n\n\u201cBeautiful Boy\u201d puts a human face on the epidemic ravaging the nation. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 72,000 people in the U.S. died from drug overdoses in 2017 alone.\n\nChalamet said he wants families to know addiction is \u201cnot a moral failure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat addiction isn\u2019t a face\u2026 addiction affects basically everyone, [and] for some reason there is difficulty in talking about this still,\u201d he said.\n\nThe film is based on the memoirs \u201cTweak\u201d by Nic Sheff, and the best-selling \u201cBeautiful Boy\u201d book by his father, David Sheff, an acclaimed journalist.\n\n\u201cI would never wish those hellish experiences on anybody, certainly not in my son or anybody\u2019s son,\u201d David told Faris. \u201cBut sometimes people get sick. And you have to deal with it. And we did the best we could.\u201d\n\nNic\u2019s drug of choice was crystal meth. He would do anything to feed his addiction, including stealing money from his kid brother\u2019s piggy bank.\n\n\u201cI was hijacked by the drugs and I didn\u2019t want to be acting the way that I was acting,\u201d Nic remembered. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\nDavid said he was \u201calways looking for Nic when he wasn\u2019t home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn't know where he was when he was on the streets ... I didn't sleep.\" he said. \"I was completely freaked out \u2026 I went to look for him in the middle of the night. I went to San Francisco, I went to Haight Street, where a lot of kids on drugs \u2026 strung-up kids, runaways [were] hanging out, looking for him. But one time he called and so I was relieved to know that he was OK that he was alive.\u201d\n\nNic agreed to meet David at a San Francisco diner, a reunion that was depicted in the movie.\n\n\u201cIt was an overwhelming time in my life, and it was overwhelming to watch the movie recreate it because it was so realistic,\u201d David said. \u201cI was so grateful to see him, mostly to see that he was alive. And I wanted so badly to connect and I wanted so badly for him to agree that he needed help and to \u2026 let me try to help him. And \u2026 in the movie, you see Steve Carell\u2019s face. And you see that he is so sad, and so broken.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have two teenagers and it's terrifying,\u201d Carell said. \u201cThe thought of a child going through what Nick Sheff went through is the most terrifying thing for a parent.\u201d\n\nCarell became famous for his comedic roles in movies like \u201cAnchorman\u201d and \u201cThe 40-Year-Old Virgin.\u201d\n\nHe said the reason he was drawn to the role of David Sheff was because \u201cit\u2019s something that I felt people needed to see. It\u2019s a national epidemic and tragedy.\u201d\n\nChalamet auditioned for the role of Nic before his breakthrough Oscar-nominated performance in \u201cCall Me By Your Name.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t have any sort of career,\u201d Chalamet recalled. \u201cIt was still very much a job of \u2026 trying to keep your cool on set.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeautiful Boy\u201d has generated Oscar buzz for both Chalamet and Carell.\n\nBut for Nic and David, the movie is a stark reminder of how far they have come as a family.\n\n\u201cIt makes me feel again that we're so lucky,\u201d David said. \u201cI hear, and I've heard over the years, people say \u2018You know, your story is our story ... but our story had a different ending. My beautiful boy died [or] my lovely daughter didn't make it.\u2019 And I didn't do anything more magical than anyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey tried as hard as I did, and we were very lucky,\u201d David added. \u201cSo I feel I think there's something a little bit guilty or maybe a lot guilty -- there's sort of a survivor's guilt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere's no absolutely no reason that I survived when other people didn\u2019t,\u201d Nic said. \u201cI guess the thing is, that as long as there is life, that's when there is always hope.\u201d\n\nAfter years of relapsing and going in and out of treatment, Nic has been sober for eight years.\n\n\u201cMy life has gotten so much better since getting sober. I've seen it with so many friends and people I work with, that when they get sober, they get their lives that they've always wanted,\u201d Nic said. \u201cYou know, your life can really just blossom and get so much bigger than it ever had been.\u201d\n\nAdded David, \u201cAnd though we were lucky and they weren\u2019t, there is a sense of\u2026 we\u2019re not alone.\u201d", "Andrew Gillum and Bill Nelson conceded in their respective governor's and Senate races in Florida, while the question of who will be voted speaker of...", "There\u2019s nothing quite like the spending the holidays in the merriment and magic of Disneyland Resort \u2013 and making the most of it by staying in one of three on-property hotels.

John Kasich shares his midterm predictions\n\nStay tuned for more deals. Well, as we know midterms are tomorrow. The rhetoric keeps getting more insane and Republican Ohio governor John Kasich has been calling for a much needed return to civility and empathy in America, which is why we're sorry he's stepping down. Please welcome back governor John Kasich. Thank you. Are you sorry that you decided to go? Well, I mean, I had a great 8 years as governor. I've been in politics for a very long time, but I'm not going anywhere. My voice is going to stay out here. Maybe you guys can even help me to keep it out there, because I think we need a voice that's calming and positive, looks to the future because we have to get this country back on track again, absolutely. Are you running for president? I don't know. I mean, all of my options are on the table. You know, in the Republican party pretty hard because it's kind of locked down right now and we don't know what's going to come in the future. But I think for the first time there is a legitimate chance for a third party candidate because if you have the Republicans on the extreme and the Democrats on the extreme, there's a big, wide open space in the middle. So all of my options are on the table, whoopi, and I just want to contribute. One thing I don't want to do is to diminish my voice because it's taken so long for me to have a voice. We'll have to see what happens here in the future. But it will be fun. So you would probably run for an independent versus primary? Right now, Meghan, you know, I don't know because -- Why do you say it's a lockdown? It's not a lockdown for 2020. Right now I'm saying in the Republican party. Right today it would be very hard to win a primary. I could win in New Hampshire but I go down south and I'd get blown out and I don't want to do that. I don't want to waste my family's time or my friends or resources. It has to be something that's legitimate, that can have an impact on moving this country in the right direction. But the primary situation on both sides sounds like it's destroying the country. Well, maybe that's why -- It's a small group of people -- Maybe that's why people are ready for a third party. I'm not saying that for sure but it might be so. Look, we don't know what's going to happen next week let alone what's going to happen in the next six months or a year. Right. But what I do know is, here's the thing, that our leaders are letting us down, and when leaders let us down, then it's up to us where we live to create a synergy with other people to be able to rise. I went to see that movie \"Bohemian rhapsody.\" I was telling Meghan about it, on Saturday night my wife and I went to see it. You know what was great about that movie? You had Republicans, Democrats, black, white, rich, poor, all in womenably stadium dancing and clapping. It sends those goose bumps about what happened when humanity is united, when we are together. And think about driving from the bottom up. Okay, I think about kind of three things. First of all, the civil rights movement, the politicians wanted nothing to do with it. It was the folks from the churches and their friends who marched in the streets. I was talking to whoopi about Mary Lou hammer. What a hero, beatings, gassings, dogs, but she wouldn't quit. She seized a high moral ground, inspired others. We changed America. The Vietnam war, if it wasn't for the people, we would still be in Vietnam, right? I mean, because they weren't doing anything. Now we have -- John, now we have cruises to Vietnam. That's right. But I'm saying it can change. But is it going to change, governor? I mean, tomorrow is the midterm elections. I know early voting is up and trump is campaigning in three states including your home state of Ohio. Yeah. Notice I'm here. Yes. Yeah. In my view, and I think a lot of people share this view, he's made this election about him, a referendum of him. He's running on race baiting, anger, especially with this caravan stuff. I mean, is this a winning strategy? Well, it's a terrible strategy for our country. Fear -- to dish out fear in order to achieve something, there ought to be some ethical limits to what you will do when you're involved in a campaign. But is it a good strategy for Republicans? I think what's going to happen in all likelihood, I think the Democrats will win the house, the Republicans will keep the senate -- this is no brilliant thing. We don't know that for sure. That's where it looks and I think the Democrats are going to have more power in the governorships across the country. That's what it looks like. Why? Because I think a lot of people have said I've had enough of this. I mean, I'm not going to live my life with anger and I don't think -- And fear. People don't want to live there. And look, I didn't vote for the guy. I didn't endorse the guy -- Is there anything you think the president's doing right? Is there anything that you would say I actually support that? I think the fact that he was able to move and deregulate parts of our economy which has created economic growth, yes. Look, I'm not here to say everything he does is bad but what I can tell you is we cannot have our leaders who divide us and cause fear. You can't have that and when you do -- Now, Abby, look, I've been in politics a long time and I've been in some really knockdown, dragout fights, back when we shut the government down and then we ultimately got the budget balanced working with Bill Clinton. You can hold positive -- strong views about things but you don't demonize the other person or question their worth or what their intentions are. That's how he's winning. That's how he keeps his base happy. Well, but the base has shrunk. The Republican party unfortunately has shrunk or maybe people said I've had enough of this. The biggest risk that the Republicans have in the future is they have turned off women. They have turned off the young. They have turned off minorities. What? I mean, you can't -- you can't do that. There's three white guys left. Let's take Ohio. Let's take my state. We're up over half a million jobs. We have $3 billion in the bank. We have held people who are small business people but people who are disabled, people who are mentally ill, people who are drug addicted, we've not left anyone behind. That's the road map in my opinion for how you must lead. You want to ask a question? I just -- I mean, I have lots of things to say but who are we kidding saying that the rhetoric is going to die down because I don't think no matter what happens tomorrow it's going to die down. We know the president hates losing. If Democrats win they're going to open up all kinds of investigations. I think impeachment talks will start immediately if they take over the house. Really, things are only going to get uglier. Do you agree? That's one scenario. The other scenario is they will not move in the direction of all these investigations which I don't like, particularly if they're political in nature, and that maybe in some sense, Meghan, they could moderate the president. I don't know, we have to see. But what I believe is that we got to stop spending our time wringing our hands, whoopi, about these leaders in Washington. No, no, I'm saying to you, we need to get the fire to start demanding change. Yeah. I'll give you one example. I got this bill I've proposed in Columbus. If you know somebody in your family or somebody in the workplace who is unstable, you can go to a court and take their gun. Who the heck is not for that, okay? A lot of people. We as the people -- I don't think so. If we the people demand that we want change at the top, let me tell you something, we scare the politicians. They may scare us but we're in charge of them. That's what people don't seem to get sometimes. People don't know what to do. And you -- and you matter. What you're doing -- you right there, young man. You didn't run that. You don't have the badges. Keep raising your hand, young man. Think about the greatest social movements. But you need to vote. That's the key. Yes, absolutely. So, always thank you for coming. Good luck. Hand wringing. Listen, like you said, you know, if you're not going to make the change, you can't bitch about it not being made. There you go.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "bad url", "A tiger that officials say killed 13 people was shot dead in central India over the weekend, igniting a firestorm of criticism from politicians and animal rights activists who said the killing was unnecessary.\n\nThe operation to find the female tiger, called T1 by authorities and Avni by animal rights advocates, had gone on for months but had intensified after the tiger claimed its latest victim in August. Since then, forest officials doubled their efforts to find it, with patrols, a paraglider, thermal drones, sniffer dogs and even cologne.\n\nBut late on Friday evening, locals in the west-central Indian state of Maharashtra tipped off hunters that the tiger had been seen near a road.\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt was the location where three [previous] human kills had occurred,\u201d Asghar Ali Khan, a 37-year-old hunter from the Indian city of Hyderabad, told ABC News. Khan was brought in along with his father, a well-known shooter, to work with the Maharashtra forest department.\n\nKhan said a team of about 14 was rushed to the spot, near the village of Borati in the Yavatmal district. The team, he said, included a forest official carrying a tranquilizer gun.\n\nAfter hours of waiting, the tiger was spotted by the official, who shot a dart at it, according to Khan.\n\n\"The moment the dart hit, the tigress was a different animal. She gave a roar, which hit our body more than hearing it,\" he remembered.\n\nThe tiger, still alive, then \"turned and came for us,\" he added.\n\nThat's when Khan said he shot the tiger.\n\n\"It was in self-defense,\" he noted.\n\nForestry officials did not respond to requests for comment. But AK Misra, principal chief conservator of forests for the Maharashtra forest department, confirmed the tiger's death to The Times of India.\n\nThe hunt for the tiger had been has been controversial from the beginning, with activists challenging the forest department in the courts. But the animal's fate was sealed a few weeks ago when the case reached India\u2019s Supreme Court. The court ruled that it would not interfere if forest rangers were forced to shoot the tiger.\n\nSarita Subramaniam, who runs Earth Brigade Foundation, an Indian NGO, has challenged the version of events put out by the forest department.\n\nHandout via AFP/Getty Images\n\nShe told ABC News from Mumbai, India, that Khan's account left many questions unanswered.\n\n\"A charging tiger, while roaring, and this guy is shooting, is not likely to face him sideways,\" she said. \"How did the bullet go from the left side and come out of the right side?\"\n\nShe accused Khan of fabricating the facts. \"He is lying through his teeth,\" she said.\n\nVillagers in central India told ABC News last month that they lived in fear because of the tiger.\n\n\"I was returning home from the fields and saw a crowd had gathered here, right at this spot,\" said Ram Krishna Lonkar. \"The tigress had attacked a farmer and killed him.\"\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\nActivists have now turned their attention to the fate of the tiger\u2019s two cubs, who are still in the wild. Some locals believe the 1-year-old cubs may not survive very long without their mother.\n\nNot surprisingly, with general elections just a little over six months away, political reactions have come fast and furious. India\u2019s opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi condemned the killing on social media.\n\n\"The greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated,\" Gandhi tweeted, quoting Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi -- no relation -- and using the hasthag #Avni.", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "Airbnb says it had its best quarter ever, even as cities across the U.S. have started clamping down on the short-term rental market", "The end of this long 2018 midterm election cycle is upon us, and we are about to hear the political verdict of millions of Americans. With approximately one-third of the country -- at least 34 million people -- having voted early, tomorrow is not Election Day per se, it is the conclusion of many election days around America. And it looks like this will be an historic election in terms of engagement and turnout. In no midterm election cycle have more than 90 million people voted, and we are very likely to blow right past that and exceed 100 million voters nationwide.\n\nInterested in Midterm Elections? Add Midterm Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Midterm Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nHere are five points to keep in mind as the returns start coming in on Tuesday:\n\n1. Pay close attention to the early voting election returns. In some states like Florida, Texas and Nevada, early voting could make up two-thirds of all votes cast, and it will give us early signs of where those states are headed. One cautionary note: we don\u2019t exactly know how many of those early votes were cannibalized from people who normally vote on Election Day. However, some initial analysis shows that many of these voters have never voted in a midterm before.\n\n2. We are going to see another epic political battle between two pillars of American politics: geography vs. demography. In 2016, President Trump carried the Electoral College (geography), and Hillary Clinton carried the popular vote (demography). It seems highly likely that Democrats will carry the popular vote tomorrow, and the GOP will win more counties. The question is if the Democrats have their votes efficiently spread across districts and states to overcome the GOP\u2019s geographic strength. We should know the answer to this fairly early on in the evening as states like Indiana, Kentucky, and Virginia begin to report results in key races.\n\n3. This is the first election in modern memory where the bases of both parties seem very energized and engaged. Normally one side is lukewarm and the other is hot. Today, both are on fire. This is one big reason why there will be a record voter turnout. One cautionary note for the GOP: the Democratic base this year looks much larger than the GOP base, and this is reflected in the strongly approve vs. strongly disapprove attitudes towards the president of likely voters. Among those most engaged likely voters, 35 percent strongly approve of the president while 48 percent strongly disapprove. And while intensity is matched by likelihood to vote, the size of the bases are much different. The GOP base is composed primarily of white voters over age 45, the Democratic base is very diverse: people of color, younger voters, suburban/urban women, etc.\n\nNick Oxford/Reuters\n\n4. Independent voters spread across America will decide this election. Those voters who either don\u2019t register a party affiliation or decline to state will determine the winners and losers on election night. This is also what happened in 2016 and previous midterms. And so while people are basing their expectation of early voting on the party affiliation of registered voters, we don\u2019t know about those who have no party registration. In many key states, Democrats seem to have about a 7 point lead among these independent voters.\n\n5. The economy is doing well according traditional indicators as well as voter confidence, but it is not helping the incumbent president or party. In every other election, when the economy was doing anything close to this well, the incumbent party either picked up seats or didn\u2019t risk losing the House or Senate.

I realized there are some really gross people running for office this year, so here are my first impressions. Dan crenshaw -- Oh, come on, man. Hold on. You may be surprised to hear he's a congressional candidate from Texas and not a hit man in a porno movie. I'm sorry, I know he lost his eye in war or whatever. You know, his cast mate, Kenan Thompson, who's going to be here tomorrow, has kind of said, you know, maybe Pete should like apologize or something. Ideas, thoughts? \"Saturday night live\" doesn't take any prisoners. They've been on the air for like, what, 40, 50 years now? They took a shot at Alec Baldwin who's part of their family, so they go after a lot of people. And this kid Davidson, his father died in 9/11, and he said I like making things that -- I like making things out of dark, awkward, weird things that you don't really find funny, funny. There's nothing I won't joke about and I think it's because of what happened to me. So he's coming from a place of -- you know, you make fun of things that are so painful to lighten the load. That's where he's coming from. But it's because of those veterans that allows him to sit and do that job every day, to tell those jokes. I'm bumped because I really liked Pete Davidson and I thought it was completely tone deaf and not just him but the producers behind him that helped write it. It's not like free speaking. He's looking at note cards when he's reading it. So this was all rehearsed and planned in advance. KREN saw is a Navy S.E.A.L. Who did five tours of duty. He lost his right eye when he was hit by on ied blast in Afghanistan and returned and did another deployment two more times. I had such a problem with this over the weekend. I'm not a snowflake. I can laugh at jokes. I would think if your father died in 9/11, I don't know his story, but maybe you would be more empathetic to people who sacrificed. I will say that if it were Tammy Duckworth who is also a hero as well and a veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, if someone had been making fun of her, I don't know if we would have the same reaction. I don't know if it's because he's a Republican, but the response as the conservatives are angry. Is he going to win? Yes. He's going to be a congressman tomorrow. Why take pot shots at people who have served and made sacrifices. It just wasn't funny. The joke wasn't funny. When I say it's in bad taste, if it's not funny, it's just not good. Is it ever okay to make fun of vets. I'm not that easily offended but I was like, oh. It seemed like such a sucker punch. Why not fun of not only someone's service but their looks. I don't ever really find that funny. And should he apologize, I mean, why not? But they do it all the time over there. Offensive humor is their stock in trade. It's not funny. Humor is the operative word. He said that's how he deals with it and that's fine if he finds catharsis in comedy which a lot of people do but that doesn't give him the right to take shots at someone else's service and people's physical pain. He has a right to do it. You have a right to speak out against it. If \"Snl\" wants to be in the game where you make fun of wounded veterans, that's a hill you'll die on alone. I didn't like it when the president of the United States did it and I certainly didn't like it when this comedian did it. I agree. People across the board have spoken out about this. You're right, he has every right to say it but we can stand up and say this is not okay. I didn't get that the president of the United States made a joke about her father? Made fun of people with disabilities. He was making fun of people. He's not a comedian trying to get a laugh. If you're making fun of veterans, even if you're trying to be funny, it shouldn't happen. We got to go.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "The son and daughter of a woman who mysteriously died aboard a cruise ship speak out exclusively to ABC News.", "Stocks are closing sharply lower on Wall Street, pulled down by more steep losses in big technology companies.

All 254 counties but I talked to some of those crews supporters that could not keep in Sudan rally Clinton mentioned the overflow crowd. And listen to what they said when I asked them who would apparently. Really Ted Cruz rally coup here raise your hand if you voted early. All of a pretty much all of you voted early this. Okay why did you utterly. Till. July a certain why did you what did you utterly does it. Martin Lawrence. Anybody else can't why did you vote early. Early states reveals that they should be loans.

Both of these candidates though they have young kids they are exhausted they tell me that this is taking all on their families. They're really ready to cross that finish line battle over work we'll be here and El Paso tomorrow night watching returns. And ten crew is he will be at his headquarters in Houston riches. Eleven hours away this is a massive state and it is a massive race Diane it certainly seems that way gosh those turnout numbers are incredible you know cruise says. He's confident they're going his way I'm guessing O'Rourke feels differently. O'Rourke definitely feels differently and he's been in the trenches he's all about a ground game. He visited all 254 counties here in the state he's really trying to appeal to. Young voters to verse voters and we did see an uptake and voter registration over half a million voters are registered new voters. Since March we just don't know what way that they are going seal go at the Paul's. But O'Rourke is counting that it's gonna go in his direction but it has been a challenge. To get both young people and Latinos to the polls here and Texas we'll see if they finally sure finely shore up. To which side is going to go.

Diane the conversation this morning is about this explosive charge from the secretary's list secretary of State's office. Accusing Democrats of hacking into the state. Voter registration system secretary of state Brian camp who's also running for governor and Democrats say has a huge conflict of interest. Is accusing Democrats of this just hours of course before the election. But according to Democrats he's offered very little evidence there's a lot of confusion. About how all this happened in.

With just one day to go Karen it you know you'd think after that big jobs report we hear a lot about the economy it's great bragging rights. But the president doesn't seem to be focusing on the. No day and the president has made immigration the centerpiece of his mid term closing argument and that's all we heard him on the campaign trail hammering Democrats on all weekend. And expected the president will continue that today when he makes stops in Ohio Indiana and Missouri over the weekend he painted eight very. Dark image of what this country will look like. If Democrats take control of congress here's what he had to say. As Lee's speech Democrats are all openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws. Violate our borders. And destroy our nation had so many different ways. The resident's message essentially Diana's boil down to you if you want more illegal immigration and crying vote for Democrats he says if UN security. And border protection vote for Republicans but you're about the economy is very important. Over the weekend the new ABC news Washington Post poll found 65%. Of Americans say the economy right now is good or excellent. That's fantastic number that's a very good. Mid term election message for the Republicans but instead the president is talking about immigration and critics say he's using that. To scare voters to get them out to the polls president himself said over the weekend. Everybody wants and be talking about the economy but he said it's sometimes just not as exciting so Diana president airplane littlest psychology saying. When people are feeling good about something maybe get complacent and you don't show up but if you're scared about something that will inspire you to go to the polls and it's a good. Point when you're strategizing politically Karen some times it's a little bit more than meets BI. Do you have any read on how confident the White House is and now things are going. The president is feeling very good about how the Republicans are doing with the senate and yesterday the president noted. He's focused his attention on the senate so perhaps he's Ari certain lay ground work there that if they do hold the control of the senate or perhaps gain control more with more seats and they pick up. It will be because of his efforts over the weekend the president. For the first time with indicating that the Republicans could lose the house says it could happen he doesn't think that the debt. It's possible that they'll be able to squeak by in keep control but Diane the president noted. He hasn't focuses much in the house he says he hasn't been able to get to those critical battleground districts that the control of the house will be won or lost by Republicans. He's this isn't just too hard to get to and there's too many of them so. If fact keeping notes here remember this on Wednesday the Democrats do take the house the president says that wasn't my area but if they Republicans do managed to gain ground in the senate the president will likely take a lot of credit for that.

They say their party is committed to providing affordable and accessible health insurance, which includes coverage for preexisting conditions, but with less government involvement.\n\nVoters have become casualties as candidates toss around these catchphrases \u2014 sometimes vaguely and inaccurately.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) advocates a single-payer national health care program that he calls Medicare-for-all, an idea that caught fire during his 2016 presidential bid.\n\nBut Sanders\u2019 labels are misleading, health experts agree, because Medicare isn\u2019t actually a single-payer system. Medicare allows private insurance companies to manage care in the program, which means the government is not the only payer of claims.\n\nWhat Sanders wants is a federally run program charged with providing health coverage to everyone. Private insurance companies wouldn\u2019t participate.\n\nIn other words: single-payer, with the federal government at the helm.\n\nAbsent federal action, Democratic gubernatorial candidates Gavin Newsom in California, Jay Gonzales in Massachusetts and Andrew Gillum in Florida are pushing for state-run single-payer.\n\nTo complicate matters, some Democrats are simply calling for universal coverage, a vague philosophical idea subject to interpretation. Universal health care could mean a single-payer system, Medicare-for-all or building upon what exists today \u2014 a combination of public and private programs in which everyone has access to health care.\n\nOthers call for a \u201cpublic option,\u201d a government plan open to everyone, including Democratic House candidates Antonio Delgado in New York and Cindy Axne in Iowa. Delgado wants the public option to be Medicare, but Axne proposes Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nAre you confused yet?\n\nSacramento-area voter Sarah Grace, who describes herself as politically independent, said the dialogue is over her head.\n\nSamantha Young/Kaiser Health News\n\n\u201cI was a health care professional for so long, and I don\u2019t even know,\u201d said Grace, 42, who worked as a paramedic for 16 years and now owns a holistic healing business. \u201cThat\u2019s telling.\u201d\n\nIn fact, most voters approached for this article declined to be interviewed, saying they didn\u2019t understand the issue. \u201cI just don\u2019t know enough,\u201d Paul Her of Sacramento said candidly.\n\n\u201cYou get all this conflicting information,\u201d said Her, 32, a medical instrument technician who was touring the state Capitol with two uncles visiting from Thailand. \u201cHalf the time, I\u2019m just confused.\u201d\n\nThe confusion is all the more striking in a state where the expansion of coverage has dominated the political debate on and off for more than a decade. Although the issue clearly resonates with voters, the details of what might be done about it remain fuzzy.\n\nA late-October poll by the Public Policy Institute of California shows the majority of Californians, nearly 60 percent, believe it is the responsibility of the federal government to make sure all Americans have health coverage. Other state and national surveys reveal that health care is one of the top concerns on voters\u2019 minds this midterm election.\n\nDemocrats have seized on the issue, pounding GOP incumbents for voting last year to repeal the Affordable Care Act and attempting to water down protections for people with preexisting medical conditions in the process. A Texas lawsuit brought by 18 Republican state attorneys general and two GOP governors could decimate protections for preexisting conditions under the ACA \u2014 or kill the law itself.\n\nRepublicans say the current health care system is broken, and they have criticized the rising premiums that have hit many Americans under the ACA.\n\nWhether the Democratic focus on health care translates into votes remains to be seen in the party\u2019s drive to flip 23 seats to gain control of the House.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe Denham-Harder race is one of the most watched in the country, rated too close to call by most political analysts. Harder has aired blistering ads against Denham for his vote last year against the ACA, and he sought to distinguish himself from the incumbent by calling for Medicare-for-all \u2014 an issue he hopes will play well in a district where an estimated 146,000 people would lose coverage if the 2010 health law is overturned.\n\nYet Harder is not clinging to the Medicare-for-all label and said Democrats may need to talk more broadly about getting everyone health care coverage.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a spectrum of options that we can talk about,\u201d Harder said. \u201cI think the reality is we\u2019ve got to keep all options open as we\u2019re thinking towards what the next 50 years of American health care should look like.\u201d\n\nTo some voters, what politicians call their plans is irrelevant. They just want reasonably priced coverage for everyone.\n\nSitting with his newspaper on the porch of a local coffee shop in Modesto, John Byron said he wants private health insurance companies out of the picture.\n\nThe 73-year-old retired grandfather said he has seen too many families struggle with their medical bills and believes a government-run system is the only way.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the most effective and affordable,\u201d he said.\n\nLinda Wahler of Santa Cruz, who drove to this Central Valley city to knock on doors for the Harder campaign, also thinks the government should play a larger role in providing coverage.\n\nBut unlike Byron, Wahler, 68, wants politicians to minimize confusion by better defining their health care pitches.\n\n\u201cI think we could use some more education in what it all means,\u201d she said.\n\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, which publishes California Healthline, a service of the California Health Care Foundation.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

I\u2019m doing my job,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cThis is how we would handle any investigation when something like this comes up.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, Kemp\u2019s office said they had officially requested the FBI to investigate the matter. The FBI declined to comment. The Department of Homeland Security said Sunday that the State of Georgia had notified the department about the issue but declined to comment further. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the state\u2019s independent investigative agency, confirmed on Monday that its Georgia Cyber Crime Center will conduct an investigation at the request of Kemp\u2019s office.\n\n\"The Democratic Party of Georgia will stop at nothing to regain relevance and power in our state,\" Ryan Mahoney, Communications Director for Kemp\u2019s gubernatorial campaign, said on Sunday. \"In an act of desperation, the Democrats tried to expose vulnerabilities in Georgia's voter registration system. This was a 4th quarter Hail Mary pass that was intercepted in the end zone. Thanks to the systems and protocols established by Secretary of State Brian Kemp, no personal information was breached. These power-hungry radicals should be held accountable for their criminal behavior.\u201d\n\nThe Georgia Democratic Party took to Twitter on Monday to join Abrams in accusing Kemp of misusing his office to influence the election, tweeting \u201cKemp is trying to play Georgians and the media for fools, just hours before polls open. Won\u2019t work. Georgians can fight back against abuses of power by VOTING tomorrow.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, the party published two emails that purport to show a private individual who pointed out potential vulnerabilities in websites used by Georgia residents to print sample ballots and registration information that the individual suggested could allow a hacker to steal or manipulate registration information.\n\nDavid Cross, an attorney who has been involved in cybersecurity-related litigation against the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office, told ABC News he was also alerted to the potential vulnerabilities by that same individual. He said he contacted the FBI \u2013 in an email exchange he shared with ABC News -- and an outside counsel for Kemp on Saturday.\n\nElection security researcher Matt Bernhard, a post-graduate student at the University of Michigan who serves as a security expert in Cross\u2019s lawsuit against the Secretary of State\u2019s office, told ABC News he was asked by someone involved in that litigation to review the claims. He said he verified them as far as he could by analyzing the sites\u2019 source code, but Bernard and other cyber security experts told ABC News that fully verifying the issues would have required potentially running afoul of the law.\n\nRuth Fremson/The New York Times via Redux, FILE\n\nBernhard outlined his findings in a blog post, which was reviewed by Adam Meyers, vice president of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike, at ABC News\u2019 request. Meyers told ABC News the vulnerabilities as described were potentially serious.\n\n\u201cThere are huge issues here,\u201d Meyers said, both because of the potential for political mischief and for cyber-criminal groups who specialize in stealing and selling personal information.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, however, Candice Broce, a spokesperson for the Georgia Secretary of State, said that no vulnerabilities had been found, telling ABC News in a statement that the \u201callegations of vulnerabilities could not be substantiated by our cyber security team.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be clear, those webpages are not linked to a location containing files with confidential or sensitive information,\u201d Broce said in a follow-up statement.\n\nThis is not the first time Kemp has raised allegations about attempts to infiltrate the secretary of state\u2019s computer network. Just days after the 2016 presidential election, Kemp requested a federal investigation by the Department of Homeland Security, citing 10 suspected unauthorized attempts by DHS personnel to penetrate the state\u2019s firewall.\n\nA report from the Inspector General of DHS released in July 2017, concluded that allegations were unsubstantiated. The investigation determined that the activity flagged by Kemp was the \u201cresult of normal and automatic computer message exchanges,\u201d and that there were no unauthorized intrusion attempts.\n\nThe race between Kemp and Abrams, who could become the nation\u2019s first African-American woman to be elected governor, has been close and contentious.

By searching a database of legal cases for specific keywords he found an increase in election challenges. From there were at least 337. Such cases in 2016. Back in 1996 he found a 108. The election we must often hear about the ones were a whole state votes on the candidates don't usually have recounts down in.

Vote more,\" the cast of \"Hamilton\" sang over the weekend, and it seems a whole lot of people around the country agree.\n\nEarly voting in several states has continued to be through the roof.\n\nAccording to experts tracking the data, at least 34 million people have voted early so far in the 2018 midterm elections, a sizeable increase of more than 27 million from in 2014.\n\nBrendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA total of 29 states and Washington, D.C., already have surpassed their 2014 early-vote totals, and eight have doubled theirs, including Nevada, Tennessee and Texas, states with key Senate races.\n\nWhat's more, several counties in Nevada and Texas already have passed, just from early voting, their total vote numbers from four years ago.\n\nLet's explain that again: Before Election Day, more people had already voted in several key Texas and Nevada counties than voted in total, including Election Day, four years ago.\n\nIn the four states that report early vote by gender, women are out-voting men 54.2 percent to 44.7 percent, but we still do not know the party breakdown across the board.\n\nInteresting though, the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll found that \"intention to vote\" was up by 24 points among liberals and 18 points among moderates compared with 2014, vs. 6 points among conservatives.\n\nWith turnout so low in recent midterm elections, more people voting could really change the result, the makeup of the chambers and our idea of where the electorate really is.\n\nThe TIP with Jeff Cook\n\nJust two days before Election Day, Republican gubernatorial nominee Brian Kemp of Georgia has shifted gears to his official post as the state's top election official and announced an investigation into his opponents for alleged \"hacking\" of a voter registration system, without presenting evidence.\n\nThe allegations are troubling, but also odd, in a race that has already featured a series of court battles over Kemp's alleged use of his position as Georgia secretary of state to suppress votes.\n\nJoshua L. Jones/Athens Banner-Herald via AP\n\nWe learned about the investigation in an abnormal and brief press release. Kemp's election officials immediately identified a suspect, the Democratic Party of Georgia, and then announced an investigation, adding the FBI and DHS were alerted, but provided no evidence of why Kemp's opponents were the sole suspect.\n\nKemp has made similar accusations in the past, in December of 2016, when he accused the Obama Administration's DHS of attempting to hack their systems. An independent investigation declared that accusation was bogus.\n\nTHE PLAYLIST\n\nABC News' \"Start Here\" Podcast.

New polling shows Democrats have edge before midterms\n\nWith the midterms just one day away, a new ABC News/Washington Post poll shows Democrats with an 8-point edge in the generic ballot.\n\nABC News Political director Rick Klein says Democrats will be looking to take advantage of competitive House races in the suburbs of major cities.\n\n2. Trump a fixture in Tennessee Senate race\n\nPresident Donald Trump has taken a big interest in close Senate races across the country, saying he's made a difference in as many as seven races.\n\nOne of those is in Tennessee, where ABC News White House correspondent Tara Palmeri says voters are responding to some of Trump's core issues like immigration and tax reform.\n\n3. Republican gubernatorial candidate accuses Democrats of hacking\n\nIn Georgia, Stacey Abrams is trying to become the first black female governor in American history.\n\nShe's running against Republican Brian Kemp, the current secretary of state whose office oversees Georgia's elections.\n\nAnd while we've already seen complaints about voter suppression, Kemp's office said it's opened an investigation into the Democratic Party of Georgia over an alleged attempt to hack the state's voting system.\n\nWe hear from David Cross, the lawyer who alerted the FBI and Kemp's office about the alleged vulnerability. He says he was tipped off by a concerned Georgia voter and does not believe the Democratic Party had anything to do with it.\n\n\"All Kemp has done is exactly what he wanted to do,\" Cross said, \"which is to make the narrative about the Democratic Party instead of everyone focusing on the fact that there is potentially a serious vulnerability in the system and that he just let it go.\"\n\nRebecca DeHart, executive director of the Democratic Party of Georgia, said Kemp's asking for the investigation is pure politics.\n\n\"This political stunt from Kemp, just days before the election, is yet another example of why he cannot be trusted and should not be overseeing an election in which he is also a candidate for governor,\" DeHart said.\n\nKemp has not commented beyond his office's initial statement saying that Democrats are under investigation, while offering no evidence.\n\nJohn Amis/AP\n\n4.

His connection to the state helped put him over the top in the 1960 Democratic primary, and eventually helped him win the presidency.\n\nInterested in Midterm Elections?

Add Interest\n\n\"He's the first president that came down here and spoke of West Virginia in a positive light,\" said Richard Ojeda, a Democratic candidate in West Virginia's competitive 3rd District. \"The sun doesn't always shine in West Virginia, but the people do.\"\n\nAs a tattooed, retired paratrooper with tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, and currently a state senator, Ojeda was launched into the national spotlight during West Virginia teacher strikes and his campaign for U.S. Congress.\n\nOjeda, who campaigns in his Army fatigues, is unlike the blue-blood Kennedy except that he, too, is a brash political newcomer, and he understands the power of a Democrat showing up and listening. Ojeda's race in the southern portion of the state, a district where Trump won 73 percent of the vote, could pave a pathway for Democrats hoping to run competitive races in Trump country.\n\nOjeda, who voted for Donald Trump in 2016, said he thinks the Democratic party -- the party that once helped put Kennedy over the top -- has lost its way in Appalachia.\n\n\"It's about finding the people in the areas that can relate to those people and supporting them. It's got to stop being about the most money,\" Ojeda told ABC News. \"You know, you find the person that everyone in that area can relate to, that cares about the people in that area, and then support that person. And if we do that, make no mistake about it, we can go back to blue.\"\n\nMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOjeda and his campaign have been working around the clock to ensure that happens. Wearing Army boots and speaking in an intense voice with a West Virginia twang, Ojeda knocked on doors and made his case in every county of the district.\n\n\"People canvassing for us are telling us literally out of 30 doors, 21 will say Ojeda, two will say my opponent and the rest will be undecided,\" Ojeda said. \"So I think that we are looking really good. I think we are going to win this.\"\n\nHis race against Republican Carol Miller is considered one of the most competitive in the country.\n\nSince the primary, Trump has campaigned three times in the state for Miller, and has lashed out at Ojeda as a \"total whacko.\"\n\n\"I've seen that person -- you can\u2019t have that person in Congress, he's stone-cold crazy,\" Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.\n\nIt's a label Ojeda's embraced.\n\n\"If I'm stone-cold crazy because I have a hard time going to sleep at night because we have kids that go to bed hungry, then I'll be stone-cold crazy, and I'm OK with that,\" Ojeda said.\n\nFor Ojeda, it's personal. He said his campaign team is made up of people who have been affected by opioid epidemic.\n\n\"My political director lost both mother and father to overdose. My financial person, he found his brother dead with a syringe sticking out of his arm and just recently lost a nephew. My media person has spent literally her whole life with her aunt and uncle because of opioids,\" Ojeda said.\n\nIn 2016, West Virginia had the highest rate of opioid-related overdose deaths in the country, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\n\"None of us come from areas where wealth is really part of life,\" Ojeda said. \"We come up in these areas, and we've watched people struggle our whole lives. We've struggled. And that's why everyone is so committed to this. I've got people who literally couldn't even tell you how many hours that they've put into this campaign, how many miles they have walked, how many doors they have knocked on, how many phone calls they have made. But they have done it, and they have done it with a smile on their face because they know that we are trying our best to be able to finally shed a positive light and bring positive light back to southern West Virginia.\"\n\nOjeda is running on a populist, pro-coal, pro-Second Amendment platform that's focused on working families, veterans, fighting the opioid epidemic and protecting social services. He's raised almost twice as much money as his opponent, Miller, who's running on a pro-Trump platform and largely shied away from the media or any public debate.\n\n\"This is such an important election, to continue the job that our president has done for the past two years, we need to make America great again,\u201d Miller told ABC News. \"There are so many different issues, the economy is starting to really roll, and we really need to keep it moving forward. Of course, in southern West Virginia we care a lot about coal, and infrastructure and all those other issues that are important to the entire country.\"\n\nAs a Democrat, Ojeda has found a way to appeal to Trump supporters, Democrats, and those who have shied away from politics. He's made a personal brand out of being loud, outspoken, and authtenic. Supporters said he's just more like the kind of West Virginian you know.\n\nWith @Ojeda4congress and @HuntingtonMayor getting to visit Jim\u2019s Steak & Spaghetti House in person.

For the occasion, Ojeda, who's normally dressed in his fatigues, changed into a suit and tie.\n\n\"Glad to see you here,\" Ojeda said.\n\n\"My honor, my honor,\" Kennedy said with a handshake.\n\nKennedy, the great nephew of John F. Kennedy, has been crisscrossing the country in support of new Democratic candidates. He said he was most excited to come to West Virginia. It's places like this, he says, where the stakes of this election are \"crystal clear.\"\n\n\"This one is personal. My family has a very deep history here, one that we are proud of, and one that I've heard stories about ever since I was a very little kid,\" Kennedy said. \"You have an opportunity to actually send a message to West Virginia and to our entire country about what politics can be and about what service can be.\"\n\n\"I sure wish I could cast that vote,\" Kennedy said.\n\nOjeda and Kennedy spent time at Jim's Steak and Spaghetti, an old family-owned restaurant in the heart of downtown Huntington.\n\nFramed above them was a black-and-white photo of John F. Kennedy, sitting in the same green vinyl benches, being served coffee in 1960.\n\nLike many West Virginians, Ojeda said his family remembers when the young political hopeful came to town.\n\n\"When President Kennedy come to West Virginia, he spoke about West Virginia and the people that gave the people here pride. And my family, my father remembers when President Kennedy was in Logan county and at places like the smokehouse standing on chairs, talking to people,\" Ojeda said. \"I think it's about service and serving the people, and that's exactly what President Kennedy did.

Their fate was sealed by the Kansas City Chiefs, the most heavily bet favorite on the board Sunday.\n\nKansas City closed as an eight-point favorite over the Cleveland Browns and won 37-21. Eighty-eight percent of the money wagered on the point spread at William Hill's sportsbooks in Nevada and New Jersey was on Kansas City.\n\n\"We were pretty much done at that point,\" MGM vice president of race and sports Jay Rood said. \"Disaster.\"\n\nIt was the third straight subpar weekend for the books, but Sunday was in a class by itself, an all-timer in some veteran bookmakers' eyes. Rood, a 25-year Las Vegas bookmaker, said it made his top 10 list of all-time costly Sundays. A sportsbook manager at Caesars Palace said it was one of the worst Sundays he could remember.\n\n\"Bad. Really bad,\" Caesars head of risk operations Jeff Davis said. \"We won one key decision today.\"\n\n\"I don't know that there was a best game [for the book],\" Station Casino sportsbook director Jason McCormick said. \"Maybe the Dolphins, which had the least handle of the day. Worst Sunday of the season.\"\n\nNormally, a day filled with favorites covering the spread is the recipe for success for public bettors. But favorites were only 6-5 against the spread on Sunday. It didn't matter.\n\n\"The public just nailed it,\" Boyd Gaming sportsbook director Bob Scucci said in an email. \"They had the big favorites -- Bears, Chiefs, Panthers and Vikings -- as well as the short 'dogs, Texans and Steelers. And a lot of the overs.\n\n\"By the time we got to the two biggest games -- Packers-Patriots and Rams-Saints -- there were so many parlays alive that we were going to lose no matter what.\"\n\nThe underdog New Orleans Saints beat the Los Angeles Rams 45-35, and the New England Patriots covered the spread in a 31-17 win over the Green Bay Packers.\n\nThe damage wasn't limited to Nevada. New sportsbooks in Mississippi and New Jersey also reported taking it on the chin Sunday.\n\n\"Welcome to sports betting,\" one longtime Nevada bookmaker said with a chuckle.\n\nBettors were in need of a hot stretch after a tough start to the season. Nevada sportsbooks won an all-time-high $56.3 million in September.
