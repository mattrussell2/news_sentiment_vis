Add Animals as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Animals news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nSgt. Dave Scott was on duty when police received a call around 11:35 p.m. detailing an elephant that had somehow gotten loose in Westtown, New York State Police Public Information Officer for Troop F Steven Nevel told ABC News.\n\nNew York State Police\n\nScott and another trooper responded to the field within 10 minutes, where the elephant was enjoying her freedom. Scott, who is familiar with the area, had an inkling that the elephant had escaped from the Sanctuary for Animals, a farm that houses all kinds of animals, across the street.\n\nScott then went to the sanctuary and alerted the owners of the elephant's breakout, who came out and ordered the elephant to go back to where she belongs.\n\n\"They came out and spoke to the elephant like someone would talk to their dog,\" Nevel said. \"They told her to turn around and head back home, and she started heading back home.\"\n\nThe 46-year-old Vietnamese elephant named Fripha, who arrived in the U.S. after she was burned by napalm during the Vietnam War, was able to stroll out of the sanctuary after a worker forgot to turn on an electric fence, Nevel said.\n\nFripha was not phased by the commotion and remained \"nice\" and \"friendly\" during the run-in, he added.\n\nNew York State Police\n\nWhile state police often get calls detailing wayward bears, dogs and deer, it was the first time Scott had ever had to escort an elephant home, describing the encounter as \"the strangest thing,\" Nevel said.\n\n\"I wish I could have seen the trooper's face when it came over the radio that we have a wandering elephant,\" Nevel said. \"I can imagine that he would have said, 'Can you repeat that?'\"\n\nABC News' Ben Stein contributed to this report.", "The House and Senate return to Washington Tuesday for the first time since well before Election Day.\n\nWhile this is a lame duck session of Congress, there is still plenty of work to get through. Here are a few of the issues that lawmakers will try to tackle in 19 legislative days over the next two months.\n\nCONFIRMING A NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and subsequent installation of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general has set off a chain reaction on Capitol Hill, primarily in relation to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections.\n\nIn his new role, Whitaker takes Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein\u2019s place as the lead overseer of the probe. Sessions had recused himself of all Justice Department activity related to the investigation into Russian meddling and now lawmakers are raising concerns that Whitaker\u2019s objectivity is compromised because of his vocal criticism before joining the administration.\n\nIncoming House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on \"This Week\" Sunday that if Whitaker is still the acting attorney general in January, he will be called as his first witness to discuss his views on the special counsel. Democrats in both chambers have also asked the Justice Department\u2019s ethics office to review Whitaker\u2019s past statements on the special counsel and weigh in on whether he should recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller probe.\n\nCharlie Neibergall/AP, FILE\n\nSenior Democrats are also calling on the Justice Department to reveal whether the agency\u2019s top ethics official advised Whitaker to recuse himself from supervising Mueller\u2019s investigation, arguing in a letter Monday that \u201cserious ethical considerations\u201d require him to step aside from managing the probe.\n\nIn their letter to DOJ ethics officer Lee Lofthus, Democrats cited Whitaker\u2019s \u201chistory of hostile statements\u201d toward the investigation in his capacity as a conservative pundit before his hiring as chief of staff for Sessions.\n\nWhitaker can serve for 210 days without being confirmed by the Senate, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose chamber will be in control of confirming Sessions\u2019 permanent successor, has said he expects Trump to announce a nomination soon.\n\n\u201cI think this will be an interim, a very interim AG. I expect we\u2019ll get a new nominee very quickly for the job,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nPROTECTING THE SPECIAL COUNSEL\n\nThe Sessions firing \u2013 which took the Mueller investigation out of Rosenstein\u2019s purview \u2013 has also reignited talk on Capitol Hill of legislation to prevent the dismissal of Mueller, or any future special counsel, without cause.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee approved such a bill, co-sponsored by Sens. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Cory Booker, D-N.J. and Chris Coons, D-Del., in April. Last week, several other lawmakers joined those senators in calling for a floor vote on the bill, which would put in place restrictions on how a special counsel could be fired.\n\n\u201cSenate debate and passage of this bill would send a powerful message that Mr. Mueller must be able to complete his work unimpeded,\u201d Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said in a statement Friday.\n\nBut McConnell has so far been categorical in saying he would not bring the bill to the floor for a vote. \"It\u2019s not going to come up because it isn\u2019t necessary,\" McConnell said Friday at a news conference in his home state of Kentucky.\n\nBORDER WALL FUNDING\n\nCongress succeeded in funding most of the federal government for the rest of the fiscal year, but they put off some decisions until after the election. Agencies, including Homeland Security, had their current funding levels extended until Dec. 7 and that means when legislators return on Tuesday, they\u2019ll have two weeks to come up with an agreement on things like a longer-term border funding package, which includes the controversial border wall.\n\nTrump has demanded $5 billion. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., the chairwoman of the appropriations committee in charge of wall funding, has previously said the request is reasonable. But Democrats are sure to object and may try to extract concessions in exchange for wall funding, such as passage of the special counsel protection bill mentioned above.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP ELECTIONS\n\nWith Democrats returning to the majority in January, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has already kicked off her second run as Speaker of the House.\n\nNicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhile many incoming Democrats pledged that they would not support the veteran California Democrat, nobody else has thrown their hat into the ring. Instead, junior Democratic legislators are vying for lower-level posts, including leadership of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for the 2020 cycle.\n\nMeanwhile, House Republicans will hold their elections for minority leadership on Wednesday.\n\nABC News' Benjamin Siegel contributed to this report.", "Transcript for The Briefing Room: No known voter fraud as votes are recounted in Florida\n\nGood afternoon in happy veterans day you're watching the briefing room at ABC news. I'm Mary Alice parks and I calling Stephanie ads in giant her home at. In a lot of news to bring T today. Our hearts feel heavy this morning thinking about I'd like this afternoon with a time that I'll days since this morning and through the weekend. Think about does California fires just absolutely devastating news. The dental seems like it keeps going up we're gonna get a lot. More on that talking to some experts and some folks on the ground in just a little bit. Well let's start with some of the political news or political show and the twenty AT and elections still not wrapped up not a we have active recounts now taking place across the state of Florida as they're trying to both recounts the gubernatorial race and the senate race. The president has been active on Twitter through the weekend and even this morning tweeting that he thinks the plan elects and should be are to be called in favor of both of the Republicans. We have is tweak he says that a large number of ballots showed up out of nowhere. And to that it's and could be massively infected and must go with the results on election night now obviously we have Democrats saying. Votes didn't show out of nowhere and they're just still being counted Democrats have pointed to big. The stacks of mail in ballots absentee ballots provisional ballots that were still meant to be counted. I want to bring in our Stephanie Walsh isn't there in Tallahassee. And we have her sent even tracking all the ins and outs and there isn't new. A court order just today for more security to keep track of somebody election materials that right. Yes governor Rick Scott actually filed two lawsuits in fact with. Broward County in Palm Beach County now the judge Embraer reminds me actually came back and said. There is no evidence of fraud in this election especially in Broward County so he actually DI governor Scott's injunction. What governor Scott essentially wanted to do was to have all of the calculators all of the voting machines in all of the ballots. Basically. Held down while they were knocked me news and make sure that they are getting pounded. And while the judge and in print that he did say that they would grant or three Broward shirt officers should be. There physically app that recount one will be looking back cameras won't be looking at he negro I wouldn't be another supervisor there. Will be overseeing those other two sheriff's. And what are you hearing about and Thursday's deadline now there isn't a hard and fast deadline to get these recounts time are they gonna make it. We'll Broward counties as they haven't even started. Actually machinery her own. That they will be starting to morrow morning what they're doing right now is there actually pulling off the one pages. And once they get those one victory to go they'll start putting them through the machines tomorrow morning but they say it won't make that deadline we saw Palm Beach County yesterday actually said it was impossible. For them to make the deadline because the machines were simply too old to do they needed to do they sends her very fat and today they came back and said. Now we actually are going to make this deadline. So right now everything seems to be going while the county's you know there at different places with the machinery company most of the counties are saying. They will be able to get that. And Stephanie I'm curious what are you hearing from the campaigns on this because it was pretty it was pretty stunning news see Andrew Gayle on the democratic nominee. For governor come out and recede his concession. Over the weekend. I look back and 530 A has an analysis of recounts and have been done in elections since 2000 it's only swung elections on average by about 300 votes. What are you hearing from from gill on and and democratic senator Bill Nelson about what the prospects are mystery. What Gillen it doesn't look here is actually asked indeed press coverage that they held it is headquarters Saturday that with me except the election results if they came back not in their favor. And his players thinking or injured feelings that as long as every vote because if there's no imminent and that there isn't anything improper. He will meet satisfied with the results of this election and now they have no sense really of how many votes might still be out there and whether they will be able to meet this march and completely bar you know very confident that there are still votes had not been counted. And they at least think that they do have a chance. Nelson also you know believes he has a chance. As well. Becoming secretary of state here in Florida. Basically from the envy them. Mail in ballots that were actually mailed by November 6. But were not giving to the counties by 7 PM on election night and should actually be counted in this machine recount. You know if they were received by the election supervisors within ten days of the election. So there are now suing the secretary of state to get those different ballots that might be sitting at post offices. Which we did see in the Miami area to make sure that those are counted so both candidates certainly Billy they have a chance of actually coming back when in the selection. Stat. Any you're going to be there tracking the arrested men as being marched towards this new recount deadline there in Florida thank you so much of shall be checking in with you later this week. But I also want to bring in Brent Sadler whose election attorney based out and Fort Lauderdale who has convert. I'm recounts in Florida in the past been actively a part of some of those controversial recounts. Are you on the phone there. I am thank you for having me yeah things are joining us so I had to ask big picture why we keep having issues like this in Florida. Well the big distinction is this there are definitely definitely operational problems. You know a lot of people are throwing around the word incompetent. Port management under funding under staffing but that isn't very big difference from fraud. Two totally different things and while I agreed there is definitely evidence of mismanagement. And other operational problems. There is zero evidence of a napkin Beers see. There's zero evidence of fraud bidders Euro evidence of anything criminal and this is supported by the statements of Rick Scott own secretary of state. Booed in charge of the division of elections. And had his own people on scene observing the entire process. You know the democratic. Director of the Democratic Party there in Florida. Said that some of the lawsuits from governor Scott. Still couldn't see who cut down and consolidate what he called consolidating power by locking up the voting machines. Was he equivalent Latin American dictators. Trying to impound ballots and voting machines. That seems like a pretty big accusation CA I mean do they get that camp. Squall I'm not to use colorful descriptions I like to be an objective thinker I'll look at the evidence but look at the law. And in this case what he's asking for an his most recent walk the is sort of boats that word counted after Tuesday night. To not be considered. And you know like if Brenda snipes in the Broward supervisor of elections fort apple Eaton couldn't do your job on time. Needle boaters should not have to pay for that. I shouldn't be disenfranchised because some lady somewhere didn't count my boat and time so he's Connie eating like a partial truth. You know bill operational flaw are the mismanagement to propagate a big lie in his own interest. He is not being objective he's taking advantage of the situation and that's were I have a very strong object objections you because every vote counts. And every vote should be counted. Speaking of those to be cats is there's a lot of controversy about whether members of the military voters overseas and meet postmark those ballots on Election Day. Whether they would feel confident that their votes would be counted any update on that. Unfortunately I don't have any new information on that issue. You know the latest being used this ruling by judge tutored here in Broward County who just phenomenal judge gave the great ruling very spare very objective. He called out Rick Scott current lack of evidence. All but out to the military ballots I can't comment on that because I'm not familiar with. While I appreciate you joining us and bringing some experts she used. I feel like we all feel like we're lacking in Florida politics considering what do you feel right and then without some group the landlord and I was going to continue. Music is there is a thank you for joining us and I'm sure we'll need to check back in with YouTube earlier this week as we reach that recount deadline. But I want to move on now to not wildfires we talked about the top just absolutely devastating and the pictures are. Are unbelievable and heart breaking a really tough to look at and just our hearts break for the families that. That are suffering with this and the first responders that are dealing working 24/7. Just nonstop it feels like. This is just impossible task. And the president in Al who really adding them to have walk back some of his comments from over the weekend it looks like. At least over Twitter he's trying to Kynan. Back track and some of his statements by to bring in Jordan Phelps is at the White House. First to talk about some of the political angle here because you know the president today tweeting is sort of love and admiration for first responders but over the weekend Jordan. He he. And this tweet they're really got a lot of quick backlash saying there was no reason for India's massive fires. That accept mismanagement. Of the forests and that they had surrounding it now or no more fed heinous. Talk to us about us or their spots in this week. Yeah that's right Mary Alice at the presidents first reaction over the weekends to these wildfires was two attacks California officials. And threatened withdrawing federal funding there is that tweet up on the screen hi this is really a remarkable. Tweet from the president at a time when people are suffering. Under these wildfires had he sent it while he was overseas. In Paris and tax. And today the president's tweak here what are you slightly including by one of the top fire officials in California he said that presidents. At attack ways ill informed and to meaning to the people who were suffering under these fires in those on the front lines. It's also. This official pointed out. 60%. Of the forests in California are managed by the federal government so for the president to point the finger are. Out local official is at a local officials is really why considering apparel government. Has responsibility for a lot of the clearing of these forests. And as the president act did I wouldn't say he walked back. That first week Mary Alice that he did temper his rhetoric after that later and they today. After that we received widespread criticism the president put out. Much more mild. The tweet that was more appropriate in town. Expressing. His condolences to those suffering there and he's been tweeting sends his support for our firm for first responders. Yeah and while we have you let's talk more about the wildfires so why we have the right there at the White House I when asked about a president's trip like you mentioned he's a bride. What is he accomplishing this weekend I know he had. Busy slate with a lot of meetings and he's he's been talking and tweeting abouts on his conversations with foreign leaders. Yes the president went to Paris this weekend to commemorate the hundred year anniversary of the end of world war wine. But with many of these foreign trips a president from it wasn't without controversy. One big story line that got a lot of attention was that president did not make at plants trip. To a world war wine cemetery the White House cited whether it was very rainy. I they are in France and that prevented him taking his presidential. Helicopter. By Mary house a lot of other world leaders did make it to that cemetery. There's. Potential for the president to have to raise and but the White House says they didn't want to disrupt traffic an area with with a big long motorcade. But is still the president taking some heat they are and it's also notable that presidents. Scheduled today is. It is act completely empty and its veterans day here. In the unites states and the president doesn't have anything on his ex wall. Also in France he. Got a bit of a public rebuke from president Mac crime the president of France. He's been one of his closest. Friends and allies on the international stage. They often talk about their friendship as late romance out but this time. Mack Brown offered a bit of a review to president from. On the global stage and sent that nationalism is the exact opposite of patriotism. And as you well know the president has in race that title of nationalist. And the sentence he got ever review from from his little buddy not so chummy this time around. No not not so chummy we'll see if there. Romance can now withstand the ups and downs germinate appreciate you joining us there from the White House there's so much news to cover out of this White House as always. But gritty keep focusing on of those fires because it just doesn't look like it's getting. I spider any kind of standards time we're seeing these images and the energy center in things done a lot of reporting on what has led to some of these extreme weather patterns is extreme fires. What did you make of the president saying this isn't about poor management. While that what I spend is saying to people is that it's not only about port management he is is not the first time that this administration has wanted to focus on fat issue. Governor Jay Brown would disagree he says it's about climate change there's also a third issue which is that you know a lot of these homes have been developed. In a very short amount of time you know of the Forest Service says that asked third of homes in the US. A 40% increase in three years leading up just when he ten have been built. Up against these wild wilderness areas which leaves them a lot more vulnerable that's why these fires are being seen as more destructive more dangerous unfortunately more loss of life. And you've also done some reporting about Serb. Climate change in this administration's response could mean if you heard from anyone that there is even going to be some acknowledgment that climate change is playing enrollments. I'm not not on any and large scale all you know policy. The Forest Service and other agencies have. This has solely been focused on this idea forest management which if you're not familiar with I wouldn't blame you it's you know these idea that. This debate over whether we should leave for us alone just kind of sustain themselves or whether we should be involved go and clean out. Dead trees clean out brush it's kind of an ongoing debate between agencies and environmental groups. They seem to be focused on that not one -- talk about climate change much the act and we have a live picture there from the ground we have. RA BC Natalie Bernal who is reporting and tracking all of the news. Alley where are you right now the story has been been changing as firefighters Conchita try to contain. These fires. Yet it's right Mary Alice I am in oak park California. Where you can see there are send devastated homes behind me. And act say just learn the story of this home over my right shoulder. There's a firefighter living in siding he was actually running around the neighborhood trying to put out spot fires. That happened here on Thursday night and dad and his wife ended up stuck inside with this three jogs. And all the setting he realized he needed to come back and get her out fortunately they were all able to get out safely. Just in time for is home to just go up in flames and meanwhile since then. He has been Al helping fight the fires that we've been hearing a lot of these stories have just firefighters you know fighting fatigue. And continuing to battle these flames which are fueled by these really strong winds that keep coming and going east Santa Anez that we've had. I'm yesterday they died down a little bit and firefighters were able to make some progress. The containment here on the Woolsey fires now up to 20% but we're not in the clear yet because these winds are really picking up. And we kept a new fires today at just to the north and alleys Simi Valley area off. That freeway that 118 freeway we had a massive fire explode just a little bit ago it was at pushing cars over. And they were trying to pull overdo it to get out of the way of the flames and so that one looks like it's been it's cleared up a little bit that really just a dangerous ongoing situation Mary Alice. You know we've been talking here about some of the politics of the stock hair is the president making it a political issue and the response. Ana California firefighters association has put out in. Back to the president. I was struck by this statement from that California professional firefighters president Brian rice who said natural disasters are not red or blue. They destroy regardless of party as a desperate time that we would encourage the president to support. In word and deed. Tell us more what you're hearing on the ground from those firefighters in his terms of there their steadfastness and this it feels like these statements and the president and make the hard job even harder. Yeah how will we just had a press conference a little bit ago. I'm to update on the Woolsey firing the police chief saying he did not want to politicize says the firefighters are working very very hard. I'm some of them have not been able to go to bad yet and that residents that we've been talking to say they they're not focused on what the president saying they're really focused on recovery efforts in you know there's been. A lot of resilience in this community a lot of people helping out some restaurants opening to help feed the firefighters people wanting to do whatever they can't. I'm an axiom what ever the baton and bring that up because the fire department ended up. Posting on face that that people I'm in in their own kindness have been bringing so many things to the fire department that they've actually been overwhelmed with things and it's actually hurting the recovery averages. As opposed to helping so they were encouraging people to reach out to actually. I'm groups and organizations that are putting together and you know release. The kids saying. And supplies and getting supplies here because valley fire department just can't have more drop offs there. I'm but again people just really wanting to head to think the firefighters we passed signs. I'm as we were driving into Oak Park that's and thinking you to that LA and venture county fire departments and people just very grateful. For all the work that they've been doing and he's very difficult conditions. Well Natalie thank you so much for your reporting for sticking with it through a really harrowing story police following. And until that fire is contained think yeah. We haven't guessed this issue though not a scientist from the US Geological Survey there in Three Rivers California John Healy I think joining us by Skype I helps out. Johnny there. A hot in here. You know what I did hear expert opinion on whether the stand California should be doing anything differently. To help mitigate the damage. These fires. Well I think one of the important things to realize is that. Be expired or is better than they are not just because we have the severe wind event every autumn. But we're at the tail end of a very severe drought in California southern gullible in. Has been a drought conditions since 2012. And other parts of the state have had anywhere from three to four years of drought and the impact of this drought is. A lot of the native vegetation has died producing a lot of debt fuel on the landscape and so you couple that with a severe winds and the fact that. Keep all accidentally or on purpose are starting me fired. It collectively. Primary. We're talking earlier about any possible impact of global warming and climate change could that have now led to some of these severe droughts on it and we know California experience as straps what do you make of that. Not clear evidence that this drought is due to global warming but there's no question that global warming. Monday the route more severe as the impact on a bit patient they'll. Just a few degrees increase in temperature can mean a much worst impact the drought but it not. At the present time Learjet global warming caused the drought. Is there anything in terms of land management that you would suggest for. For cities and communities that are looking at this as a new. Very scary normal for the state of California how we're talking earlier about whether or not and towns and in building too far incidents in the foothills. Is a state property you have to look at how they how they mapped out community is moving forward. Well that's certainly one avenue where were likely to make headway in that is through. Serious look at our land planning decisions because. The population is growing continuously in California. And in the next several decades were expected increase by 50%. And where we put these people will determine how many people aren't risk to these wildfires so better planning decisions. The other important issue has do it. What starts these fires speak Pez. We get severe winds and drought. Frequently. But it is they don't resulted in big fires because nobody starts a fire during those of dams and the more people we have and landscape the more likelihood somebody's gonna start a fire and often times. In recent years the worst offenders in terms of igniting fires are our line. And so certainly better planning efforts in terms of where we put power lines in the types of our alliance we audience for example underground power would mean one. Potential late do you reduce fire station. That's really injure staying. And right now we just obviously in the middle of this. I'm terrible story just worry about all those that are still in that -- and destruction from this terrible fires thank you so much for joining us. And we'll continue to follow you know sort of all the research and information out of California. But before we wrap today are breeders show. I feel like we were started talking about 2018 and all the sun in the same shout in a matter of twenty minutes with a top about. What do you get sleep like that in just a little bit finale today you've covered a presidential announcement I did I woke up this morning and I had. It's said wade who is running for president and it turns out that there is a new name was thrown into the ring Richard on Jenna. Who ran for congress last week and lost in west Virginia's third congressional district is a Democrat. He announced his bid for the White House today on the National Mall in front of the Korean War memorial is seen there. He's a really ancient ice in a very compelling background is a former army paratrooper and he really has that message of economic populism of and really trying to fight back against Donald Trump very forcefully and directly. And we interviewed him documents again and he was a character knocking on doors and West Virginia in his army fatigues. He is and that's and we honestly today on veterans day are thinking about. Veterans across the country across the world those that we love and those that we honor we meet today with some images of how the country's honoring that's. I'm Mary Alice and Rosanna seventy Ann's diner holiday you can watch more our coverage of veterans day and thank you for watching the briefing room.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "European Union auditors on Tuesday said that Turkish officials refused to provide information that would help establish whether 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in EU refugee aid money is being properly spent.\n\nThe auditors said in a new report that Turkey's family and social policies ministry declined access to the names, ID numbers and addresses of people who benefited from two EU cash-assistance projects.\n\nThe projects include a system whereby refugees can withdraw around 30 euros in cash from pre-paid cards to help meet their needs.\n\nThe auditors said the ministry cited data protection laws as the reason for not providing the information. They said it's \"very rare\" for the court to be denied access to documents.\n\nChief court reporter Bettina Jakobson said that \"neither the (European) Commission nor the European Court of Auditors was able to track the project beneficiaries from their registration to the payment.\"\n\n\"This is a serious situation,\" she said. \"Normally as an auditor you would say you would like to follow the flow of money from the cradle to the grave. We cannot do that here.\"\n\nJakobson said \"there is a risk\" that not all the money is reaching the refugees.\n\nEU countries agreed in 2016 to give Turkey at least 3 billion euros in Syrian refugee aid money and other incentives to persuade the government in Ankara to stop migrants leaving for Greece.\n\nThe bloc said that if the money was properly used it could provide a further 3 billion euros in assistance. Around 3.5 million Syrian refugees are estimated to be on Turkish territory.\n\nThe EU has hailed the agreement with Turkey as a great success as it has helped slash migrant arrival numbers. However, many migrants are still languishing in terrible conditions on the Greek islands.\n\nThe bloc wants to replicate versions of the agreement with countries in northern Africa as it seeks to stop migrants setting out on dangerous voyages in rickety boats across the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nAsked whether the EU refugee money in Turkey has been well spent, Jakobson said \"I think so, yes. But of course we could have had more value for money.\"", "Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\nThe American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, who have medical experts from around the nation on the writing committee, have released updated guidelines on managing cholesterol to minimize the risk of heart attack, stroke, and death. The new guidelines advocate for more aggressive treatment with statin therapy and getting LDL cholesterol counts, commonly referred to as \u201cbad cholesterol\u201d to your target level \u2013- in general, less than 100mg/dL; for those with risk factors, less than 70mg/dL.\n\nWhat is cholesterol?\n\nCholesterol is a type of fat found in blood and cells. It travels in bundles called lipoproteins. Cholesterol itself isn\u2019t bad -- the body needs it to make hormones, vitamin D and digestive fluids, and it helps organs function properly. But having too much cholesterol can be a problem.\n\nThere are two forms of cholesterol:\n\n- LDL (low-density lipoprotein): \u201cbad,\u201d unhealthy cholesterol. It builds up in arteries forming plaques, which can block the flow of oxygen-carrying blood to major organs including the heart, and has been shown to be associated with cardiovascular events including heart attacks and stroke. LDL levels are influenced by the food you eat, genetics, liver function and other factors.\n\n- HDL (high-density lipoprotein): \u201cgood,\u201d healthy cholesterol. It takes extra cholesterol out of arteries and delivers it to the liver, removing it from the body.\n\nHow do I know if I need to lower my cholesterol?\n\nThere are three tests to talk about with your doctor:\n\n- Non-fasting blood test to measure LDL cholesterol\n\n- Coronary artery calcium score\n\n- Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) Risk Estimator -- an equation to calculate the 10-year future risk of a heart attack\n\nBased on these tests, your doctor will decide if you should be on a statin.\n\nWhat can I do to lower my cholesterol?\n\nLifestyle changes including exercise, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking can prevent 80 percent of heart disease. Diet has been shown to be vitally important and effective in preventing heart attacks and reducing the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events in those who have already had a heart attack. Plant-based and Mediterranean diets are effective but you must find a diet that works for you. However, lifestyle changes may not be enough; you may need to take a statin to lower your LDL further.\n\nWhat are statins?\n\nStatins prevent heart attacks by lowering LDL and reducing inflammation, among other mechanisms. They can be used to prevent a heart attack or stroke before it occurs, or prevent a second heart attack or stroke.\n\nWhat are the side effects of statins?\n\nThe risk of serious side effects range from one in 500 to one in 1,000, which is considered very low. Muscle aches are a possible side effect, but are not considered serious. An increase in the dose of statins is not associated with an increase in side effects.\n\nWhat is the bottom line of the new recommendations?\n\nTalk to your doctor about what LDL level is right for you, and use the highest dose of statin tolerated to get to that target LDL level. And, as always, continue with lifestyle modifications, including exercise, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking.\n\nJohanna Kreafle, M.D. is an emergency medicine physician at the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.", "bad url", "Transcript for California wildfires grow as 2 new blazes break out; dozens remain unaccounted for\n\nFirefighters on the front lines battling fatigue and a new round of ferocious Santa Ana win.

This is based in descriptive behavior,\" Houser said.\n\n\"Differences in definitions and methodology make statistics about sexual violence from different sources even harder to compare. There is no common definition of criminal sexual assault across the 50 states or in federal crime statistics, and there is no shared understanding of misconduct that may not be criminal in nature,\" West wrote in a Medium post with Houser.\n\nThe 21 categories range from the \"non-criminal, non-touch behavior such as leering or flirting or inappropriate comments, all the way up to things that fall under state statutes for criminal sexual assault,\" Houser added.\n\nBen Fathers/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nUber has faced a spate of bad publicity in the past few years, leading to the resignation of its founder Travis Kalanick from the CEO position last year. Former Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was brought in to turn the company's culture around, and West is part of that effort.\n\nIn joining Uber, West, a former Obama administration associate attorney general, rejoined former Attorney General Eric Holder and Obama campaign manager David Plouffe in Uber's upper executive ranks. As the company looks to recast its image, it has taken initiatives to confront its critics and present a sustainable corporate culture.\n\nIn May, Uber became one of the first companies to drop forced arbitration and confidentiality requirements for sexual harassment and assault cases. Last week, Google and Facebook also announced they would drop forced arbitration and allow victims to file lawsuits that become part of the public record.\n\nMonday's Uber announcement was met with mixed responses by victims' advocates.\n\n\"I love what Uber is doing and saying here. We have to move beyond the usual employer 'training' about sexual harassment having to be 'severe or pervasive,'\" Nancy Erika Smith, an employment lawyer who represented Gretchen Carlson and other women in their sexual harassment suits against Fox News Channel's Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly, wrote ABC News in an email. \"That phrase was made up by judges who effectively amended the law to say that 'some' sexual harassment is okay. We haven\u2019t lessened harassment in the workplace by what we\u2019ve been doing so far \u2013- so I appreciate this effort to improve on the communication regarding unacceptable workplace behavior.\"\n\nBut the others say taxonomy is not enough.\n\n\"While classifying and ultimately reporting types of sexual misconduct is important, taking strong steps to prevent sexual misconduct ought to be the primary focus,\" said Doug Wigdor, a lawyer who represented women who had been raped by their Uber driver. \"There are steps they could be taking to eradicate any definition of sexual misconduct that would be far more worthwhile -- panic buttons in cars, tamper-proof video cameras in cars, better background checks, interviews before hiring drivers.\"\n\n\"We all know when a woman is raped or touched inappropriately, it's a bad thing,\" Wigdor added. \"The effort should be preventing these things in the first place, instead of focusing on what bucket it goes into.\"", "The president of Afghanistan told a U.S. audience Monday that his country is not losing the war to the Taliban and is not at risk of collapse amid escalating attacks by the militant group and an expansion of the territory it controls.\n\nPresident Ashraf Ghani said his administration is intent on seeking a negotiated peace with the Taliban, which have shown no interest in direct talks with a government they see as illegitimate.\n\n\"The Taliban are not in a winning position,\" Ghani said by video to an audience at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University in Washington as a suicide bombing in Kabul and a deadly militant assault on districts in eastern Afghanistan suggested government control was slipping further.\n\nGhani said that more than 28,000 Afghan forces have been killed in the past four years but that the military will be able to retake territory as long as it has an air force and commando troops. He said most of the losses incurred by its security forces were in defending static positions, so the government was rethinking how it deploys its forces.\n\nSpeaking on Veterans Day, the Afghan leader paid tribute to American sacrifices in Afghanistan, including the death of Brent Taylor, a Utah mayor serving as a major in the state's Army National Guard who was training Afghan commandos. Taylor, 39, was fatally shot a week ago by one of his Afghan trainees.\n\nBut Ghani also offered a rare public accounting of the scale of the Afghan losses. He described how their casualties have risen sharply while U.S.-led coalition casualties have declined after Afghan forces assumed responsibility for combat operations in the country. He said that since 2015, 58 American forces have died in Afghanistan.\n\n\"In the same period, 28,529 of our security forces have lost their lives and become martyrs,\" he said.\n\nU.S. military officials have previously indicated that Afghan casualties have been increasing, but they have avoided giving hard figures, apparently because of political sensitivities.\n\nIn its most recent report to Congress, in October, the special inspector general for Afghanistan said Afghan casualty numbers had been reported only in classified form since September 2017 because the U.S. military command in Kabul said it had stopped making them public at the request of the Afghan government. However, the report said that the average number of casualties between May and October this year was the greatest it has ever been during similar periods.\n\nOn Oct. 30, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Afghan forces had more than 1,000 dead and wounded during August and September alone, \"and they stayed in the field fighting.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has marginally increased U.S. troop numbers to train Afghan forces and intensify military pressure on the Taliban in hopes of forcing the insurgents to negotiate an end to the 17-year conflict. Successes on the battlefield have been elusive. The inspector general report said the number of districts under Afghan government control and influence has declined and stands at just 55 percent \u2014 down 16 percentage points in the past three years.\n\nU.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad is on his second tour of the region in a month, seeking to kick-start a peace process. The diplomatic veteran is making stops in Pakistan, Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, where the Taliban maintain a political office. The insurgents say they met Khalilzad in Qatar last month. The Taliban have so far refused direct negotiations with Kabul, which they view as a U.S. puppet.\n\nOn the sensitive topic of the U.S. role in talks, Ghani said there was \"total agreement\" between the U.S. and Afghan governments on moving the peace process forward.\n\n\"U.S. engagement is to ensure that talks with the Taliban result not in negotiations with Taliban but with talks, direct talks, between the Afghan government and the Taliban,\" he said.\n\nHe insisted that the Afghan government was seeking a negotiated peace but would not do so \"from a position of weakness.\"\n\nIn a possible sign of America's efforts, Pakistan released two Taliban officials on Monday, members of the militant group said. Abdul Samad Sani, a U.S.-designated terrorist who served as the Afghan Central Bank governor during the militants' rule in the late 1990s, and a lower-ranking commander named Salahuddin, were freed, according to two Taliban officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media.\n\nGhani, however, said Pakistan has yet to demonstrate a \"sense of urgency\" in seeking an end to the Afghan conflict and a change in its policies.\n\nKabul has long protested that Afghan Taliban leaders and fighters enjoy sanctuary inside Pakistan, which Islamabad denies.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Robert Burns contributed to this report.", "Transcript for Inside the Senate offices\n\nI mean if you valley road and on Capitol Hill now one of the coolest parts of covering high.

You're the office of senator Roy Blunt this season he Harry Truman's office and what a treat we have senator point here with us. And he's going to tell us about some of the amazing history in this room. Senator we are actually standing in the opposite used to belong to then senator Harry Truman and you're telling me he was here for eight. Of the ten energy use in the senate Tintin it is not an office that automatically goes with the statement just an office truly lucky for. A Missouri and to have so Truman was here for eight years that's a picture of him standing right there in front of this window at his. Pretty piled high desk. And then he also which worked here the 82 days he was vice president but he was working here. Is as vice president today he became pres exactly president Wally was working here just didn't know it yet he went over. Oh late afternoon to have the drink was Sam Rayburn was speaker of the house. Passed a note and you need to come to the White House something is happening and lots of things were happening in April 1945. It just happened that day. What happened was he had become president and the first thing he did the next morning when he was president. Was come back here to clean out his desk I think Alley the first time. He saw press is president was out in the hallway there we're photographers. There. The night before when he was sworn in. But this was the first place he actually interacted with press. As president of United States was here in the hall where the Russell building. Rock and does not the president lockout as president while he you know he wrote his mother that night he still handed a letter writing president. Heroes mother that night today I went to the White House thinking I was gonna see the president I got there and found out I was the president when Harry Truman got here he was considered a machine politician from. Kansas City the campaign had been focused on the fact that he was part of the so called prendergast machine. And frankly a lot of members had kind of a hands off attitude is standoffish attitude. To Truman for awhile. But he was well liked in the senate so much so Alley that I think he's the only vice president that ever had any substantial amount of office space to work done. A because he was allowed to keep the three rooms he had in the Russell building. As senator he was allowed by the senate to keep those rooms as vice president so. The president Truman started out his first two years in the senate were down the hall this play in this interior hallway we have here in our office. The office I use now. But there were 96 senators say we're all in this building and so basically as opposed to the ten or so rooms or twelve rooms that. Most senators haven't Russell bill today that would have had about three rooms. And so we started there are moved I guess down here to be closer both to the senate floor and to be closer what was then the senate cafeteria which is where the commerce committee. Period as a man priority if a man with priorities if so here's a picture I think this was probably wouldn't Harry Truman used to spot the first two years. Not in this office but it's his first coming to the senate. And vice president John Nance Garner. Who was FDR's vice president the first two terms. Somehow had managed to get possession of a couple of Jesse James is guns. And so it looks like he's about to shoot freshman senator. Harry Truman Bo what he's really doing is showing in two. Two guns of that famous Missouri outlaw. What I really like about this is Larry. Long cigar ash that is comfortable is still resting on the end of faux cactus Jack garner was the Texans nickname from. You validly taxes I think. There is breaking Harry Truman menaces new freshman senator I think this picture probably had to be color rise later. Where unit took a black and white picture but then you went in and and individually colored it because they weren't taking many color photographs in the forties but there's Truman during the I think the Truman commission days in. The globe right there behind the more you can keep track of what was happening.

Add California Wildfires as an interest to stay up to date on the latest California Wildfires news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nAs the country began to see first-person videos of terrified residents evacuating, the president posted a tweet that placed blame on poor policies related to forests, saying there is \"no reason\" for the massive fires except poor forest management.\n\nBut experts say the situation is more complicated and that there are multiple factors that influence how much fires spread and how dangerous they are.\n\nHere are five things to know about wildfires.\n\nPreventing wildfires isn't easy\n\nForest management refers to how states and federal agencies take care of forests to keep them healthy, including when to remove dead or dying trees or use small, controlled fires to remove fuel and keep wildfires from spreading.\n\nThere has been some debate over how proactive forest managers should be in clearing dead or dying trees or dead brush, which can serve as fuel for fires.\n\nThe Trump administration recently adopted a new strategy empowering managers to more aggressively clean out these areas, but environmental groups have said that approach could limit habitat for endangered species or drastically reduce forests.\n\nTrump's tweet makes a connection between forest management and the wildfires in California, but not all wildfires happen in forests. Many of the fires in California are fueled by dry grass, brush, and trees, but are not only happening in forested areas.\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service received more funding to manage forests in the most recent spending bill earlier this year, after warning Congress for years that fighting fires was using up more and more of the agency's budget.\n\nJustin Sullivan/Getty Images, FILE\n\nClimate change worsens fire conditions\n\nWind conditions and temperature are a big factor in whether wildfires spread and what areas are at risk, but broader trends in the climate play a big role as well.\n\nWarmer temperatures alone don't cause fires, but drought and insect outbreaks that kill trees and plants create more fuel that helps fires spread, adding to wildfire risk in California and other western states, according to the National Climate Assessment published in 2014.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown has been vocal about the impact of climate change on fires in the state, saying the conditions have created a \"new abnormal\" where the fire season lasts all year.\n\nThe Trump administration has denied the connection between climate change and wildfires this year and continued to say that forest management is the biggest factor.\n\nMore people live in areas at risk for fire\n\nMany of the largest and most destructive wildfires in California's recorded history have been in the past 20 years but fires a not a recent phenomenon in the state.\n\nOne reason the more recent fires are more destructive and deadly is that there's been more development in parts of California where there have been fires before, putting more families and homes at risk and making it more complicated and costly to fight fires.\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service reported this year that a third of homes in the U.S. now touch forests or other wilderness, a more than 40 percent increase between 1990 to 2010. That study found that \"growth often results in more wildfire ignitions, putting more lives and houses at risk.\"\n\nBrock Long, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has warned that communities need to be aware of the risks of building in areas prone to natural disasters.\n\nSpeaking during Hurricane Michael in Florida, a month before the California wildfires began, he said: \u201cI love the beach. I love the mountains. I grew up in the mountains of North Carolina. But if you want to live in these areas, you\u2019ve got to do it in a more resilient fashion.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m afraid of is hurricane amnesia,\u201d he added. \u201cTen years is going to go by and we\u2019re going to forget what happened in Mexico beach. So how do we build a culture of preparedness? \u2026 FEMA tries to do it every year, but a lot of people don\u2019t pay attention to anything that we do or say when it\u2019s a blue sky day and nothing is happening.\u201d\n\nCBS2/KCAL9 via AP\n\nMany wildfires are caused by humans\n\nRemember Smokey Bear's slogan \"only you can prevent forest fires?\" In many cases that's true.\n\nIt usually isn't until months after a devastating wildfire that officials can confirm how it started. Some researchers say humans are playing a bigger role in starting fires in areas that don't normally burn.\n\nA study published in 2016 found that humans accounted for 84 percent of all wildfires in the U.S. between 1992 and 2012.\n\nSome human-caused fires have been blamed on arson or negligence, like a teenager who was accused of starting the Eagle Creek Fire in Oregon after throwing fireworks into a bush while hiking.\n\nBut wildfires can start with much smaller actions by people, like leaving embers from a campfire, tossing a cigarette into the grass, or even sparks from a vehicle on the road.\n\nABC News' Anne Flaherty contributed to this report.", "Transcript for Marvel Comics legend Stan Lee dies at 95\n\nWell to his many fans Stanley was a real life superhero his real name was Stanley Martin Lieber was born in Manhattan in 1922 the child of immigrants.

Add Russia Investigation as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia Investigation news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to charge me with,\u201d said Jerome Corsi in an interview with ABC News on Monday. \u201cI think my only crime was that I support Donald Trump. That's my crime, and now I'm going to go to prison for the rest of my life for cooperating with them,\u201d he later added.\n\nCorsi is one of more than a dozen individuals associated with political operative Roger Stone -- a longtime and close ally of President Donald Trump -- who have been contacted by the special counsel. The witnesses, many of whom have appeared before the grand jury impaneled by Mueller\u2019s team, have told ABC News they were asked about Stone\u2019s dealings during the 2016 election and what if any contact he may have had with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange through an intermediary, which Stone denies.\n\nMuch remains unknown about Mueller\u2019s interest in Stone. But Corsi has emerged as a central figure of interest to Mueller as he builds his case, sources confirm to ABC News. Corsi, who Stone told ABC News he has known for years, has frequently appeared with Stone on-air for Infowars, where Stone currently serves as a contributor.\n\nCorsi described his experience with the investigation as \u201ca horror show\u201d and \u201ca nightmare,\u201d telling ABC News the special counsel\u2019s probe, \u201cIs an inquisition worthy of the KGB or the Gestapo. I feel like I've been through an interrogation session in North Korea in the Korean war.\u201d\n\nJoe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s office declined to comment on Corsi\u2019s remarks to ABC News.\n\nIn recent weeks, ABC News reported that Corsi returned to Washington, D.C., again for more closed-door meetings with special counsel investigators, and was scheduled to make a second appearance before the federal grand jury in the probe. However, Corsi\u2019s second grand jury testimony was ultimately canceled, and Corsi says prosecutors with the special counsel\u2019s office told his attorney to expect forthcoming charges.\n\nReached by ABC News on Monday, Corsi's lawyer, David Gray, declined to comment on the matter.\n\nShortly after his interview with ABC News, Corsi hosted a live stream on his YouTube page in which he reiterated his expectation to be indicted, telling supporters; \u201cI fully anticipate in the next few days to be indicted by Mueller.\u201d\n\nMueller\u2019s interest in Corsi is believed to stem from his alleged early discussions about efforts to unearth then-candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. The special counsel has evidence that suggests Corsi may have had advance knowledge that the email account of Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, John Podesta, had been hacked and that WikiLeaks had obtained a trove of damning emails from it, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told ABC News.\n\nCorsi\u2019s account to ABC News of his time spent with investigators also identifies Wikileaks\u2019 release of Podesta\u2019s hacked emails as key to the special counsel\u2019s inquiry of him.\n\nIn response to ABC News\u2019 interview with Corsi, Stone defended Corsi as \u201ca man who has been squeezed hard but refuses to do anything but tell the truth,\u201d and called into question both his and Corsi\u2019s alleged connections to Wikileaks.\n\n\u201cThey seem to think you know that I knew in advance what Assange was going to do; I'm not going to go into details at this point, but that was the basis of it,\u201d said Corsi. \u201cAnd as far as I can recall, I had no contact with Assange. And that didn't seem to satisfy them.\u201d\n\nCorsi said he was first approached in late August by FBI agents at his home in New Jersey, who presented him with a subpoena to testify before Mueller\u2019s grand jury. Corsi added that over the last two months, he\u2019s spent 40 hours with investigators over the course of six meetings, which he says have included special counsel prosecutors and an FBI agent.\n\nAfter the subpoena was served, Corsi said that he decided to cooperate with the special counsel\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cI had two computers that I used, I handed them both over, a time machine that recorded all the emails in my computer in a contemporaneous state 2016 -- completely unaltered,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked with the FBI at Quantico so that they could easily recover all my tweets and my Google account. My Google account they could see every place I've been, every click I've made, everything Google records.\u201d\n\nAfter the FBI\u2019s visit, Corsi said, he and his attorney agreed to cooperate with the special counsel\u2019s office and proffered to meet with special counsel investigators to answer their questions. \u201cThey have everything: Electronic surveillance -- everything electronic probably that I ever did in my life if they wanted -- every credit card, every phone call, every email, and I turned it all over to them as well,\u201d he added.\n\nDeclining to give specific details on the matter until Corsi learns what he\u2019s potentially charged with, he said the special counsel initially wanted him as a witness and told him he had not committed any crimes.\n\n\u201cAnd then it blows apart...at the end of two months...this deteriorates, and after a while, my mind became mush,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd every time I'm scared to death.\u201d\n\nCorsi said that from there, after two months of questioning, things deteriorated between him and investigators.\n\n\u201cThey make it sound like it all fell apart and they were constantly pressing me on did I have a contact with Assange, and -- to the best of my knowledge -- I never had a contact with Assange,\u201d Corsi said to ABC News. \u201cAnd they just couldn't believe that because they said I seemed to know too much about what Assange was going to do. And I said you know that's what I do in my business: I try to connect the dots.\u201d\n\nWhile Corsi is not a widely-recognized figure, his handiwork in the political arena has at times become very well known. He has served as the pioneer of several enduring political smear campaigns during national campaigns throughout the 2000s.\n\nCorsi\u2019s most penetrating smear campaign is the same one that helped forge his bond with Trump. He is widely considered one of the early promoters of the so-called \u201cbirther\u201d movement, which pursued the idea that former President Barack Obama was born in Kenya, not in America. The theory was debunked and widely denounced as baseless, racist vitriol. Corsi and Trump have long been blasted for not walking back their claims even after Obama produced his long-form birth certificate. In fact, it was only in the final stretch of his successful 2016 presidential bid that Trump finally acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S.\n\nCorsi has also been cited as one of the architects of a 2004 effort to bring then-Democratic presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry\u2019s war record into question through a 527 political organization called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. The group attempted to cast doubt on Kerry\u2019s Vietnam War record and question the injuries he sustained when he earned decorations that include a Bronze Star, a Silver Star, and three Purple Hearts.\n\nCorsi claims that his work is part of the reason he believes investigators are probing him.\n\n\u201cMy conclusion was as much as they say they want only the truth, I believe that they have a narrative and they\u2019re looking for fast facts to fit their narrative,\u201d he said. \u201cI've written 20 books since 2004 and I have reason to believe...that this is payback for those books.\u201d\n\nShortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration, when Corsi joined the controversial conspiracy theorist Alex Jones\u2019 right-wing outlet, Infowars, Jones reportedly boasted that Corsi \u201chad a history\u201d with Trump, and that the two had been acquainted for \u201c40-plus years.\u201d\n\nWhen ABC News asked if he would be open to making a plea deal with the special counsel\u2019s office should they charge him in coming days, Corsi replied, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to be a plea deal with?\u201d and expressed his suspicions about the possible charges investigators may claim against him.\n\n\u201cThey said I didn't commit any crimes. I can't remember all my emails I can't remember all my phone calls, [and] I tell them that. It's impossible; it's a perjury trap from the moment you get going,\u201d Corsi said.\n\n\u201cMy crime is that I didn't tell them what they wanted to hear. They won't believe it, but this is the most frightening experience of my lifetime. I'm being punished for trying to cooperate with them in a game that I was set to lose,\u201d he added. \u201cI couldn't win this game...it wasn't a game; I was trying to tell them the truth. But you forget that somebody was in a meeting and you lied to them.\u201d", "Part of the fun in watching Marvel movies was finding out how Stan Lee would make his presence in his famous cameos.

In the Gaza Strip so Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has returned to Tel Aviv early. He was in Paris of course for that parents peace formally dozens of other world leaders. Including president Tran. And he returned early because. Of an incident in the Gaza Strip now Hamas says that an Israeli unit entered deep into the Gaza Strip about two miles east of Khan Yunis in the Gaza Strip. And targeted and killed a senior leader in their military brigades a guy named nor barricade he's 37 years all of and he is a unit commander. In now because some brigades now Israel says this was not an assassination attempt that they sent in a leap unity and it was an intelligence gathering operation gone terribly wrong but what both sides agree on. Is that there was a confrontation. There is higher exchange. Any Israelis called in the Israeli air corps'. Hamas then sends dozens of airstrikes came down at least forty the Palestinian health ministry says that seven total Palestinians were killed including bar K. Seven additional Palestinians were wounded it in that confrontation Israelis now say. Added a lieutenant commander was also kills an Israeli lieutenant commander in an Israeli soldier were wounded. Most of says the body in the Linda were taken back out of the Gaza Strip the funerals for those seven Palestinians killed what happened. Later today in Gaza and after that we should know whether or not this conflict will escalate it comes there really interesting time both from prime minister Netanyahu was out of the country of course in Paris. As if this was a high level assassination operation that was ordered. Surprising that it would have been order with a prime minister out of the country but it also comes at a time when both sides are speaking fairly positively.

Sunny there. How do here. You know what it your expert opinion on whether the state of California should be doing anything differently. To help mitigate the damage. These fires. Well I think one of the important things to realizes bit. These fires or is better than are not just because we have the severe wind event every autumn. But we're at the tail end of a very severe drought in California southern gospel in. Has been in drought conditions since 2012. And other parts of the state have had anywhere from three to four years of drought in the impact of this drought is. A lot of the native vegetation has died producing a lot of debt fuel on the landscape and so. You couple that with the severe wind and the fact that. Keep all accidentally or on purpose are starting new fires. It collectively. Primary. We're talking earlier about any possible impact of global warming and climate change could that have our led to some of these severe droughts on camino California experiences house what do you make of that. Not clear evidence that this route is due to global warming. But there's no question that global warming. Makes these drought more severe in terms of the impact on the vegetation boat. Just a few degrees increase in temperature and mean a much worst impact of the drought but it not. At the present time clear that global warming caused the drought. Is there anything in terms of land management that you would suggest for. For cities and communities that are looking at this as a new. Very scary normal for the state of California how we're talking earlier about whether or not and towns have been building too far incidents in the foothills. Is a state property you have to look at how they how they mapped out community is moving forward. Well that's certainly one avenue where were likely to make headway in that is through. Serious look at our land planning decisions because. The population is growing continuously in California. And in the next several decades were expected increase by 50%. And where we put these people will. Determined how many people are at risk to these wildfires so better planning decisions. The other important issue has do it. What starts these fires speak Perez. We get severe winds and droughts. Frequently. But is they don't resulted in big fires beat that is nobody starts a fire during those dents and the more people we have and landscape the more likelihood somebody's gonna start a fire and often times. In recent years the worst offenders in terms of igniting fires are our line. And so certainly better planning efforts in terms of where weak but power lines in the types of our alliance week Libyan for example underground power would mean one. Potential late view reduce fire station. That's really injure staying. And right now we just obviously in the middle of this.

The safety of Indonesia's airlines had been questioned long before the Lion Air accident.\n\n\"There has been a lot more trepidation about flying smaller airlines that Americans have never heard of\" since the Oct. 29 Lion Air crash, said Blake Fleetwood, president of Cook Travel in New York. \"It is pushing people to the bigger airlines. People are scared.\"\n\nBefore plunking down big money to book international flights, nervous flyers can tap into resources that can provide red-flag warnings if there are doubts about a carrier's safety.\n\n\u2014 The Federal Aviation Administration determines whether countries meet international safety standards set by the United Nations' aviation agency. Five currently do not \u2014 Thailand, Bangladesh, Ghana, Curacao and Sint Maarten. Airlines from those countries can't launch new flights to the U.S. Indonesia got off the blacklist in 2016.\n\n\u2014 Europe bans 120 airlines from its skies. Most are smaller carriers from developing countries in Africa and parts of Asia. Lion Air was banned for nearly a decade until 2016; other blackballed Indonesian carriers only got off the list in June.\n\n\u2014 Aviation Safety Network has an accident database that can be searched by airline or country.\n\n\u2014 Websites like AirlineRatings.com rank carriers based on crash records and other data. That site gave Lion Air a rating of one star out of seven in 2016 but six out of seven last year, after U.S. and European regulators upgraded Indonesia's aviation regulatory regime.\n\nSuch ratings have their critics. Skytrax , a UK company that does research for airlines and surveys travelers on airline quality, says there is no objective way to rank airlines on safety due to uneven reporting of incidents by airlines and regulators around the world.\n\n\u2014 And there are companies such as Argus International that will provide reports on charter airlines. Since they charge a fee, typically $50 to $150, such services are mostly used by corporate travel departments.\n\nFatal airline accidents have been declining for about two decades. By some accounts, 2017 was the safest year yet. The Aviation Safety Network and To70 , an aviation consultant in the Netherlands, said there were no fatal crashes involving commercial passenger airlines last year. The reports excluded cargo planes, military aircraft, and flights on planes certified to carry fewer than 14 people.\n\n\"Aviation safety has become much better even in places that were notoriously unsafe at one time,\" said Alberto Riva, managing editor of The Points Guy , a website for frequent flyers.\n\nWithin a country, Riva said, some airlines have better safety records than others. He said he would not worry about flying on Garuda Indonesia, the national carrier, \"but if I could find a way to circumvent Lion Air, I would do that.\"\n\nFleetwood, the travel agent, said, \"I would steer clear of any airline that is not certified to fly to the European Union.\"\n\nMatt Kepnes, who wrote \"How to Travel the World on $50 a Day,\" said he follows the news closely enough to have a sense of which airlines have good safety records. \"I don't do much digging beyond that unless it is an airline I haven't heard of, especially one that doesn't fly to the U.S. or (European Union), as they have tight airline regulations. Then I look.\"\n\nKepnes said airlines that fly to many countries tend to have a better safety record. He is more cautious about smaller airlines and domestic carriers in countries where he doesn't trust the safety standards.\n\n\"I won't fly a Russian carrier ... they have a history of poor safety and the planes are quite old,\" he said. \"Indonesia has a spotty safety record, so I don't like flying their domestic airlines. The same for India.\"\n\nJay Johnson, president of Coastline Travel Advisors in Garden Grove, California, said clients frequently ask about personal safety, but are less likely to ask if transportation is risky.\n\n\"Because there is so much attention placed on dangerous countries or regions, travelers tend to ask questions of safety on the ground rather than how they get there,\" he said. He said air travel in the U.S. is so safe that when people ask about a specific airline, it's usually about creature comforts and not safety records.\n\n\"It's almost as if travelers assume they will arrive safely, but does the airline have lay-flat beds?\" he said.\n\nTravel agents frequently recommend buying travel insurance for overseas itineraries in case you are unable to make the trip. However, if you try to cancel because the airline on which you are scheduled to fly has an accident, insurance is unlikely to reimburse you. Cancellations are covered only if the reason is specifically listed in the policy \u2014 such as terrorism, a weather event, or illness \u2014 said Jenna Hummer of Squaremouth.com , a travel insurance-comparison site.\n\nThe exception is for people who buy a \"cancel for any reason\" policy. However, such policies generally must be bought when you book the trip or soon after, and they typically cost about 40 percent more than standard trip-cancellation insurance, Hummer said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDavid Koenig can be reached at http://twitter.com/airlinewriter", "Tunisian Prime Minister Youssef Chahed faced lawmakers in a marathon debate Monday ahead of a vote of confidence needed to approve the government he reshuffled a week ago in a bid to end a months-long paralyzing political crisis.\n\nThe debate was still going 12 hours later, a sign of the enmity coursing through Tunisia's political scene.\n\nHowever, the prime minister was unlikely to lose the vote due in large part to support of the largest parliamentary bloc, the moderate Islamist Ennahdha party, which has 68 seats in the 217-seat parliament. Chahed needed 109 votes to keep his government from collapsing.\n\nChahed pleaded for \"political stability the nation needs to overcome difficulties,\" notably economic and social, ahead of 2019 legislative and presidential elections.\n\nJoblessness is above 15 percent, inflation is nearly 8 percent and trade and other deficits are chronic in the North African nation. The budding democracy, also coping with extremist attacks, is having trouble overcoming political problems despite major strides since autocratic leader Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was toppled in 2011.\n\nChahed, 41, incurred new anger among detractors a week ago, including from the Tunisian president and the prime minister's prime political enemy, the president's son, with his appointment of 19 new Cabinet ministers. The changes were aimed at \"ending the political crisis,\" he said, but the reshuffle exacerbated enmity from his opponents.\n\nThe office of President Beji Caid Essebsi, who chose Chahed for the job of prime minister in 2016, said the president was informed of the changes \"very late\" and by mail.\n\nThe president's son, Hafedh, who has risen to the top of the Nida Tounes party created by his father, has for months been in open conflict with Chahed, a one-time party figure.\n\nThe powerful UGTT union has also demanded \"profound changes in the government\" \u2014 including its leader.\n\nThe friction has kept the government from tending to the nation's business, and the daily concerns of Tunisians.\n\nWhile naming a new justice minister, Karim Jamoussi, Chahed made no changes to key ministries like interior or defense. He also brought some surprise faces into the government, notably a Tunisian Jew, Rene Trabelsi, as tourism minister, a first in more than 50 years \u2014 and one topic that raised questions during Monday's debate. He also named as minister of public function Kamel Morjane, who served as defense and foreign minister under the now-toppled Ben Ali.", "Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate in Georgia's still-uncalled governor's race, is hoping a count of all provisional ballots can help her close the gap with Republican Brian Kemp and force a runoff.\n\nInterested in Midterm Elections? Add Midterm Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Midterm Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nAbrams filed a lawsuit on Sunday asking for all provisional ballots be counted, citing instances in which voters she said voters would have cast their ballots for her, but were turned away. Provisional ballots are considered a fail-safe for voters who arrive at the polls and may not have all the necessary documentation at that time, but whose ballots can be verified in the days after the election.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed against Georgia's new Secretary of State Robyn A. Crittenden, seeks to address a Georgia law which puts a three-day time limit on how long provisional ballots can be verified and counted. But the midterm elections in Georgia saw a \"historic number\" of provisional ballots, according to the lawsuit, making it more difficult to verify and count them all in time.\n\n\"Under Georgia law, it appears that any voters whose provisional ballots have not been resolved by November 9, 2018, will be disenfranchised, simply because the counties in which they respectively reside could not address their ballots in time. There is no reason it needs to be this way,\" the lawsuit reads.\n\nThe lawsuit comes on the heels of a race in which her opponent, then-Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, was alleged to have engaged in voter suppression, beginning with reports that millions of voters were unknowingly purged from registration systems under his tenure, many of them African-American.\n\nSince Election Day, Abrams\u2019 campaign has vowed to staunchly moderate the incoming vote tallies and make sure every vote is counted. Kemp has maintained that his lead is insurmountable, despite uncounted ballots, and declared himself the winner. ABC News has yet to project the race.\n\nIn response to Abrams' lawsuit, his campaign said she had moved from \"desperation to delusion.\"\n\n\"On Saturday, military, overseas, and provisional ballots were reported throughout Georgia,\" Ryan Mahoney, communications director for Kemp, said Monday.\n\nKevin C. Cox/Getty Images\n\nIn Georgia, the winner needs 50 percent of the vote or a runoff is automatically triggered. Kemp says there aren\u2019t enough ballots left uncounted to close his lead, which stands at about 60,000 votes. As of Monday morning, Abrams had 48.78 percent of the vote compared to Kemp\u2019s 50.52 percent.\n\nCounties in Georgia are continuing to count and certify their ballots, including late-arriving absentee ballots in some parts of the state.

Switzerland isn't a member of the 28-nation bloc.\n\nAlternative for Germany, which came third in last year's election, recently distanced itself from a group that supported its election campaigns with large-scale advertising \u2014 potentially constituting illegal funding.\n\nThe German parliament has asked the party, which campaigns heavily against immigration, to provide a detailed explanation of its handling of the Swiss donations.", "Newly-released commercial satellite imagery suggests North Korea is continuing to develop ballistic missile sites at more than a dozen locations, amid stalled discussions over the country's nuclear weapons program between North Korea and American diplomats.\n\nThe images, taken earlier this year, of the Sakkanmol missile operating base were released on Monday by the Beyond Parallel project, part of the Washington, D.C.-based think tank called the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\nSakkanmol, which CSIS says is currently \"active and being reasonably well-maintained by North Korean standards,\" houses short-range ballistic missiles typically capable of traveling over 500 miles. The base's location just over 50 miles from the South Korean border places the missiles well within range of Seoul's over 9.5 million residents.\n\nSakkanmol is one of 13 out of an estimated 20 undisclosed locations where North Korea continues to develop ballistic missiles, according to the report.\n\nCSIS/Beyond Parallel/DigitalGlobe 2018\n\nThe quiet continual operation of Sakkanmol and other sites flies in the face of what the Trump administration says is a pledge by North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons program.\n\nWhile Pyongyang has publicly promised to dismantle some test sites related to its nuclear program, there has been little concrete progress toward denuclearization. North Korea has not provided the U.S. with even a list of its nuclear capabilities, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged in July that the country was still producing fissile material used to fuel nuclear weapons.\n\nBut President Trump continues to boast about the success of U.S. efforts, saying as recently as last week that North Korea had halted missile tests and returned American hostages.\n\nWhile that is true, top North Korea experts were quick to point out that Monday's satellite images show Pyongyang is moving ahead with its planned mass production of ballistic missiles, publicly ordered by Kim Jong Un last January, despite entering into negotiations with Washington.\n\nIt is NOT deception. Kim literally ordered ballistic missiles to be mass produced on New Year\u2019s day 2018. He never offered to stop producing them, let alone give them up. Ever. He is doing exactly what he said he was going to do. https://t.co/sbE6MyPQes \u2014 Vipin Narang (@NarangVipin) November 12, 2018\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is getting played by Kim Jong Un,\u201d Sen.

It was later revealed that the North Koreans had canceled, according to U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley and South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha.\n\nWhile no clear reason was given for why the sudden scheduling conflict, the U.S. and South Korea tried to quell concerns and said the talks would be rescheduled shortly.\n\nBut the meetings were supposed to dig in on how to follow through on commitments made during Pompeo's last visit to Pyongyang in early October, including North Korea allowing international inspectors into the country to confirm the dismantlement of a nuclear test site and a missile engine test site.\n\nThose inspectors still have not been allowed into the country, and the North Koreans have so far not set up meetings with Pompeo's point person, Special Representative Stephen Biegun, who is supposed to lead talks on the working level.\n\nCSIS/Beyond Parallel/DigitalGlobe 2018\n\nThe administration has said repeatedly that there has been progress since the Singapore summit in June between Trump and Kim, but North Korea maintains its entire nuclear arsenal, has not provided the U.S. details of its nuclear capabilities, and now appears to be upgrading its ballistic missile arsenal.\n\n\"We have given a lot of carrots up until now. We're not gonna get rid of the stick because they haven't done anything to warrant getting rid of the sanctions yet,\" Haley said Thursday in a rare admission of the lack of progress. \"The U.S. has shown a lot of actions. Now it's North Korea's turn. There's no time to stall or no time to delay.\"\n\nStill, the administration is moving ahead with plans for the two leaders to meet again early next year, officials have said, and the rescheduled Pompeo meeting will lay the groundwork for that.", "Less than a week into Mississippi's Senate special election runoff, GOP Sen.

Solis/AP\n\nEspy, an African-American from Yazoo City, was swift in his reproach of her comments, calling them \"harmful\" and \"hurtful to millions of Mississippians\" on CNN's New Day Monday.\n\n\"Those comments we heard that were published yesterday are very disappointing,\" he said. \"They are hurtful and they are harmful. They are hurtful to millions of Mississippians who are people of goodwill and they're harmful because they tend to reinforce the stereotypes that held back our state for so long and that have cost us jobs and harmed our economy.\"\n\n\"This is 2018,\" he added. \"We're going here in Mississippi into the third decade of the 21st century and we just should not have this. We need leaders that would try to unite us and not divide us.\"\n\nHis latest response comes a day after Espy condemned her remark in a statement: \"Cindy Hyde-Smith's comments are reprehensible. They have no place in our political discourse, in Mississippi, or our country. We need leaders, not dividers, and her words show that she lacks the understanding and judgment to represent the people of our state.\"\n\nEspy, a former Clinton cabinet secretary, would be the first African-American senator from Mississippi since the Reconstruction Era if elected. On Nov. 6, he finished in second place behind Hyde-Smith by netting 40.6 percent of the vote to Hyde-Smith's 41.4 percent.\n\nHer remarks also drew a rebuke from the president of the NAACP, who called her comments \"sick\" and \"tone deaf.\"\n\n\"Hyde-Smith\u2019s decision to joke about 'hanging,' in a state known for its violent and terroristic history toward African Americans is sick,\" Derrick Johnson said in a statement Sunday.\n\nHe later wrote on Twitter that her \"response is tone deaf and demonstrates disregard of MS racial history,\" adding, \"We've seen this from Rob DeSantis & others this election season & denounce such mean spirited behavior,\" referring to the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Florida Ron DeSantis.\n\nJonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nHer campaign did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for further comment.\n\nHyde-Smith, who was appointed to the open Senate seat by Republican Gov. Phil Bryant after former Sen. Thad Cochran resigned due to health concerns, shared the podium at the Monday event with Bryant as he reinforced his support for his pick, telling the audience, \"All of us in public life have said things on occasion that we could have phrased better.\"\n\n\"I know this woman and I know her heart,\" he added. \"I knew her when I appointed her. I know it now. She meant no offense by that statement. There was nothing in her heart of ill-will.\"\n\nHyde-Smith has a long history in Mississippi politics, previously serving as the state's Agriculture Commissioner from 2011 until her appointment to the Senate, as well as formerly serving as a state senator for 12 years beginning in 1999 when she was elected as a Democrat. She switched to the Republican Party in 2010, and even scored President Donald Trump's endorsement earlier this year during the special election's \"jungle primary.\"\n\nBefore Nov. 6, multiple candidates from both parties competed in a four-way race to secure a majority of the vote to win the seat. With so many candidates in the field, including conservative state Sen. Chris McDaniel and Democrat Tobey Bartee, none of the contenders garnered 50 percent of the vote on Election Day, sending the race into a runoff on Nov. 27 between Hyde-Smith and Espy.\n\nThe deep red state voted for Trump by nearly 20 points in 2016, but also faces a complicated and difficult past with racism.

Kirsten Gillibrand on Democrat's focus and Matthew Whitaker's appointment\n\nSo New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand won a landslide victory last week in a midterm election where women ruled, and she joins us now to talk about where America can go from here. Please welcome senator Kristen Gillibrand. Thank you. Thank you all. So congratulations on your re-election. Thank you. Democrats have a little power now in the house, so where do we go now? We don't want to do what has been done. How -- if you were in charge, what would your priorities be? I think this election is an opportunity to actually meet people's needs and to help people. When I traveled across New York this last year, the number one issue was people are worried about health care, affording medicines, affording health care, so making sure it's a right and not a privilege. That means taking on the drug companies, it means taking on the insurance companies, making sure pre-existing conditions are protected. We also need to make sure that people can get fair wages for their jobs, making sure we strengthen unions, strengthen workers' rights, make sure that we reward work like having a national pay leave plan, having better pay, equal pay for equal work, having better benefits and better job training. And last but definitely not least, we have to get the money out of politics because none of this is possible if you have the continued corruption of the political process with the nonstop money that's funneled into campaigns by special interests who write the bills in the dead of night. So we have to take on money in politics. Campaign finance reform? Yes, we need campaign finance reform, publicly funded elections. But changing who's in charge, you have to bring it back to the people. This democracy is based on we the people and what we need in our lives. Unfortunately because of the money in politics, the special interests and the powerful have such an outsized influence in outcomes, so we need to restore our democracy to our founding principles, that every vote counts, which is why we're having recounts around the country right now which is really important and the people should be in charge. It has to go back to the local level and that means getting the special interest money out and meeting the needs, helping people, caring about other people's kids as much as we care about our own kids. The supreme court has that citizens united thing. It's not going in that direction. It's going in the other direction, more money in politics. That's right. That's why you need to change the player's lists. We need to try to get money out of politics and restore what our fabric of democracy is about which is making sure everyone has the chance to live the American dream to work their hardest to earn their way into the middle class. That's what's not happening and that's what people voted for. They want change and they want to restore our democracy. There are a lot of Democrats that want president trump out of office. According to exit polls, 77% of Democrats want him impeached. There's talk about having more Democrats in power. How are you going to use that power? Is impeachment a bridge too far for those Democrats in power? We certainly need oversight and accountability. The Republican congress refused to hold president trump accountable on any of the issues that you mentioned, whether it's Russia's involvement in the election, whether it's self-dealing or lining the pockets of the cabinet members and of trump and his family. You've never seen, in my opinion, an administration that has nor corruption than this one, so they have to do their jobs. Is that a win for Democrats? It's not about winning or losing. It's about our democracy. It's about this country. Do you want to stand up to someone who's taking on the free press, someone who's undermining the rule of law, who's undermining the freedom of the judiciary. These are issues at our core, the balance of democracy, the balance of power. The president has been trying to undermine it every chance he gets. Plus, he's put so much hatred and division into this world, into this country, whether he's hating on transgender troops or DACA kids or -- Blaming firefighters for fires. Right. He's dividing the country on racial lines. Impeachment is not going to work though because you need two-thirds of the senate for that, right? We need oversight. How do you get the guy impeached? It's the duty of the house of representatives if the president is implicated in a crime. People are waiting for the Mueller investigation to be completed. We need that transparency by the Mueller investigation. What needs to happen the day we get back into congress which is tomorrow, we need to pass a law that protects that investigation because there's a bipartisan bill waiting to be voted on in the senate today that would make sure that that investigation is protected, that all the documents would be preserved. Mitch Mcconnell has already said, senator, that that plan, he will not allow to go forward. Hopefully the American people will continue to speak out about this because again, when you put in place someone who has attacked the Mueller investigation -- which by the way, Whitaker's appointment is illegal. It's unconstitutional. The fact that he's on the record calling the Mueller investigation a witch hunt and a sham shows that he's biased and should not have that role today. So you need to protect the Mueller investigation, make sure Mueller can't be fired without cause and protect the documents.

Kirsten Gillibrand says she's 'thinking about' running for president\n\nHey, we're back with senator Kirsten Gillibrand. 86 Democrats declined to support Nancy Pelosi. 56% says Pelosi should be replaced. I don't think she should be the leader but I'm not a Democrat. I want to know from you, do you think she's the leader right now? I think she's tough as nails and gets things done. She echoed the trump administration, one of the greatest losses of all time. She's not -- Compared to 2010. I'm saying historically -- One thing about Nancy Pelosi, she knows how to get things done. She knows how to bring her caucus together. She said her number one goal is to make sure health care is a right and not a privilege. She understands what's going on in people's lives, that they're worried about not being able to afford to see a doctor when they're sick, protect their children when they have pre-existing conditions. That's what she's focused on so I think she'll do a great job and I support her. This is a moment for all of us to make sure that the people who voted for us, all those women, all those men, all those people that came out to vote, that they're actually heard. This is when our democracy works best, when regular people stand up and demand it, and that's what this election was. It was a referendum on what president trump has put into the world and wanting that accountability, oversight, and wanting people to be heard. And we need to protect them. We need to help people and health care and education and jobs are the things on their minds. So I believe she'll do a good job in moving that forward so we can actually begin to serve the people that we're elected to represent. Well let's talk about your new book which I know you're so excited about because it's so wonderful. It's called \"Bold & brave.\" Right here. Ten heros who won women the right to vote. It's illustrated so beautifully. Tell us about it. The illustration is incredible. Myra Coleman, an unbelievable illustrator. She brings together all these suf row jests. She was an amazing investigative journalist who wrote about lynching but she wasn't going to be sold during the suffrage movement that she had to be silent. She said, no, I'm marching with my Illinois delegation. She never said no, never gave up. Each page is about women who did extraordinary things, who never gave up, never gave in, who knew that if they wanted to accomplish anything they needed to right to vote. It's one of the reasons why these vote recounts that are happening in both Florida and Georgia are so important. When Stacey Abrams says every vote must count, she's standing on the shoulders of these women who worked their whole lives to make sure that women had the right to vote. This election was an election where women won. We had over 120 women win their races. We had millions of women turning out to vote. So this book is for little boys and little girls to understand what leadership looks like, that, in fact, this took a long time to make sure that our democracy had everyone's vote counted. Let's make sure we keep it that way. I want to ask one last question before we go because you have another -- how many years left on your term as senator? Six. Six more years. Yeah. Six more years. Yes. So are you staying in the senator are you going to run for president? Well, I'm obviously very dedicated to serving new yorkers but that is a very important moral question that I've been thinking about and I've been thinking about it because as we said earlier what president trump has been putting into this country is so disturbing, so divisive, so dark that I believe that I've been called to fight as hard as I possibly can to restore that moral integrity, that moral decency. Sounds like a yes. So I'm thinking about it. All right. So our thanks to senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Her new book, \"Bold and brave: Ten heros who won women the right to vote\" is out tomorrow, and you know what, y'all?

My god. And so, the tweet put out by the guy in the white house kind of freaked me out. He was blaming California for poor forest management and threatening to stop federal payments if they don't fix it. Now, this is a man who doesn't believe in global warming, so let me put it this way, there hasn't been any rain for a very long -- we're in a drought in California. That's why things are dry, see? And if there's a spark or an ember, they travel and stuff burns. So you see, it's not that people aren't doing their jobs. They're doing their jobs as best they can. And people have died and lost their homes, and you're blaming them? You're blaming forest -- what, what, what? What? First of all, it didn't start -- he said the forest. It started in a valley. His geography is off the wall also. You know, embers fly. Yeah. Embers move. Stuff is turning. Yeah. People are saying they have never seen anything like this before, ever, ever, ever. Just looking at the video and the photographs, it's -- it's -- I think you said today in your morning meeting it looked like hell. A lot of fire experts, the state's leading -- firefighters association, they've all come out against the president, especially during this time of need. As leaders of this country you're supposed to comfort and console those in need. Time and time again his first instinct is never emotion. Remember Puerto Rico and even the synagogue shooting, he went into -- Blame mode. Usually 24 hours later it is a more thoughtful tweet usually when his team gets to him and says you really need to change the narrative. I think someone else sends the tweets out when that happens. That's what the country needs. We need emotion and comfort in these times. He's not capable of it. I wouldn't want any emotion or comfort from him. I really don't. When Obama did it, it was ininsear. 31 people have died, 228 are unaccounted for. More firefighters die of suicide than in the line of duty. 122 committed suicide while 93 died on the job. We have to take care of our first responders as well. That's what I was thinking. In my home state of Arizona, in 2013, 19 of 20 firefighters, there was a movie called \"Only the brave\" about it. I have a good friend who's husband -- she lost much of their house. We have to think of our first responders who are out there fighting what looked like hell to me and I would have preferred compassion for them putting their lives on the line right now. Or how about a little intelligence right now. That's better. When I think about this, if there has been no rain because we don't have any rain -- It's also a desert. There's also that. But there's no rain, there's no switch. It's dry. Global warming seems to be real. If you're not sure, start with this is a horrific thing that's happening, not we're going to take funding from you. What the hell, man? It also seems as though nobody is watching out for the world right now, you know? Since nine of these fires -- of the ten largest fires since 1932, nine have occurred since the year 2000. So that means that something's happening to the planet. Climate change. And more people are moving into these foresty areas also which is causing more of the problem. It's like these shootings at schools. Before they lifted the ban during the bush administration against assault rifles, semiassault rifles, whatever they're called, semiautomatic, we didn't have as many of them. So it's like nobody is watching out. I feel like I'm living in a mentally ill world. You know who are? Our first responders and everyone in this room. They're the ones that are watching. I know that and I appreciate that tremendously from you people, I do, but I feel as though people who are in government need to be making laws to protect us. Or we need to sort of is a group say, you know listen, because it's fire there, it's tornados over here. And hurricanes. This is not going to stop, but what needs to -- what needs to change is how the people at the top stop tweeting. Stop it. And also know a little bit because the federal government owns half of the forest land in California. Duh, yeah, there's that. So, I don't understand how he can stop federal funding when they own it.

Carlos Figaro is an Iraq war veteran who lost his leg to an ied. He and his wife have an 11-year-old daughter born with a rare birth defect that eventually left her a double amputee. They've overcome more challenges than most families will ever have to deal with, and then they were hit with even more. Here's their story. 2003 I was a combat engineer on route to mow zul and an ied hit the bottom of the vehicle which caused me to be ejected. Woke up in the hospital. The left side of my leg was dead, severe nerve damage, and my foot would just hang. For me the surgeries were the easy part. It was the recovery with my PTSD and anger and nightmares. A lot of the times I didn't understand but to say that he's been through a lot is an understatement. After the 29th surgery amputation was recommended and I went with it for the quality of life. Looking down I knew that what was causing me so much pain was no longer there. From there the doors were opened. I was offered to train at the national sports center. I saw him on a snowboard and he inspired me to do it. I'm like, oh, I should try that. There you go, baby, turn! I did try it and I loved it. It's funny how limitations can be put on people without knowing that person's drive. Lily does triathlons. We do 5 Ks. 10 Ks. Wakesurfing was the one that I was pretty scared about but that's who he is. You can get out and live your life. I was racing on the world circuit when I finally was able to listen to my voice males and phone calls that I had missed and one of them was Jess saying that everything is burned down. Northern California burning out of control there, no end in sight. 5700 structures destroyed. There were flames on our car, flames that were bigger than anything you can imagine. All I could think of was how do I get home. By the time I did get ahold of Jessica, she said there's no home to come to. The first couple pictures that I finally was able to see, the one that just floored me was lily's legs. They didn't survive the fire. They were damaged, they were done, but they were there. You know, a home is held up pie -- by beams and support structures and that's what we are. As a family, we know every day can bring a different challenge but by supporting one another, laughing with one another, loving one another, we take each day as it comes. It's my honor here today to please welcome Carlos, lily and Jessica to the show. First of all, thank you so much for the sacrifice to our country and the sacrifice that you've given. All you've been through, how are you staying so positive? Lily. He's never been one to give up. She's never been one to play the pity party. On my worst days, she's what keeps me going. She could easily throw out any complaint and she doesn't. She keeps walking, she keeps charging. Any obstacles we both face we get over them or under them or around them. She's what keeps me going. Incredible. Lily, what keeps you going? My mom. She's always by my side. She's always telling me keep on going, just keep on going, just be brave and do whatever, like whatever that supports you up. She's a pretty awesome mom. Carlos, the new apartment is not conducive to the needs that you and your daughter have. Tell us a little bit about this. So the doorways aren't wide enough for when lily's in a chair. If she has blisters or sores she can't wear her legs. We try to teach her Independence and for me the biggest fear is we have step stools and ladders all over the house but if she tries to microwave something, my fear is if she's in her blades on a stool -- Right. If I hear a little knock, I think she's falling and I don't want to run to her. I want to give her that Independence because I let her know that the world isn't going to coddle her but it's still that fear what if she falls, what if she gets hurt. It's just those fears all around the house. We have step stools all over the place. She's to the point whether she wants to do things herself and I don't want to be in there and intrude. I'm sorry to interrupt you but I think we can all agree that this apartment situation is not working for you. No. You're not the only ones that think that. Please welcome frank siller. Please tell him why you're here. Hi, Carlos. I'm here because of the home Depot foundation. Together we build specially adapted smart homes for our country's severely injured service members for the great heros that have given so much for the country and I think that together we can admit and contract with these great heros if something happens to them we better tell their families we're going to take care of them when they come back from serving our country, shouldn't we? And the Home Depot foundation just doesn't do that today, they do that every day. Together we build specially adapted smart homes so we have a great surprise for you. Don't you think Carlos and his family is deserving? The Home Depot foundation is going to build you a specially adapted smart home, a home that you can work off your iPad and you'll never have to worry about another home the rest of your life. But wait, there's more. We didn't forget the veterans here today, so members of our studio audience, you're going home with a $100 Home Depot gift card so you can start making stuff happen as well. Thank you all so much. Thank you all. Your story is so inspiring and you're all so wonderful and you're all what makes America great, all of you in here too. I'm so honored to be in your presence.

A shopper spending $40 at any of the companies on Small Business Saturday will get $10 off purchases at the other seven. Kim Roman, owner of Mama Java Coffee, says the group, which will market the event on Instagram and other social media, came up with the idea just a few weeks ago.\n\n\"We were chatting about ways to be unique and help promote each other,\" she says.\n\nMany communal Small Business Saturday events have grown to the point where they're organized by local chambers of commerce and community business organizations that have big marketing budgets. About 200 indie retailers throughout Portland, Oregon, are banding together in a marketing effort called Shop Little Boxes that will run from Friday through Sunday. The stores are offering discounts, many of them 10 percent, and shoppers get raffle ticket numbers for each visit and purchase they make. Shop Little Boxes has a smartphone app that shoppers can use to find participating stores and to register their raffle ticket numbers.\n\nRetailers say they do see sales blip up during Small Business Saturday, but their aim is also to remind shoppers that they are there year-round.\n\nThe event in Henderson, Nevada, like many others, is aimed at fostering goodwill; Shop Small Henderson will be a five-hour block party with activities for children. Parents may not be able to do much shopping during such events, but owners say they do return to shop after the party is over.\n\nLandlords also sponsor Small Business Saturday events at their developments. Pier Village, a residential complex in Long Branch, New Jersey, has about 30 retail tenants, and many will be taking part in a communal Small Business Saturday event.\n\nSome of the events aim at giving craft makers and artisans a place to sell their creations; about a dozen craft makers will take part in a pop-up event at Broadway Market, a retail complex in Seattle. And some companies with surplus space are inviting small vendors to set up shop on their premises \u2014 in Elmhurst, Illinois, Brewpoint Coffee is hosting small retailers in its roastery.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor more small business news, insights and inspiration, sign up for our free weekly newsletter here: http://discover.ap.org/ssb\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

With a heavy heart, we share our deepest condolences with his daughter and brother, and we honor and remember the creator, voice and champion of Marvel Comics.\n\n\u201cStan Lee was as extraordinary as the characters he created. A super hero in his own right to Marvel fans around the world, Stan had the power to inspire, to entertain, and to connect. The scale of his imagination was only exceeded by the size of his heart,\u201d said Bob Iger, Chairman and CEO, The Walt Disney Company.\n\nStanley Martin Lieber, aka Stan Lee, loved the written word from an early age, and wanted to craft stories like those in his favorite books and films, which he consumed voraciously. From a simple upbringing in the teeming landscape of Manhattan, young Stanley worked his way through a succession of jobs until the day he found himself an assistant at a comic book publishing company\u2014Timely Comics.\n\nIn between refilling artists\u2019 inkwells, erasing pencil lines from comic pages and fetching an untold number of lunches, Stanley expressed his desire to write and create tales of his own; in the May 1941 issue of CAPTAIN AMERICA COMICS #3, he got his wish. Readers would find a prose story in that issue, \u201cCaptain America Foils the Traitor\u2019s Revenge,\u201d sporting the byline of \u201cStan Lee.\u201d A star was born.\n\nAs Stan\u2019s roles and tenure with Timely Comics grew and evolved, so did the company itself. With Stan at its helm, Timely Comics morphed first into Atlas Comics and then into the name that would catapult it into legend and forever be synonymous with Stan Lee: Marvel Comics.\n\nAs Marvel\u2019s Editor-in-Chief, Stan \u201cThe Man\u201d Lee made his voice the voice of the stories themselves. Writing virtually every Marvel title and working with such luminaries as Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, Don Heck, Gene Colan and John Romita, Stan began building a universe of interlocking continuity, one where fans felt as if they could turn a street corner and run into a Super Hero. A rich collection of characters grew out of his nonstop plotting sessions with his artists, including the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, Thor, Iron Man, the Hulk, the X-Men, and more. Today, it would be almost impossible to find a corner of the Marvel Universe that Stan didn\u2019t have a hand in.\n\nMarvel fans found a friend in Stan Lee. He introduced the famous \u201cStan\u2019s Soapbox\u201d to speak directly to his readers, reaching a personal level rarely seen in comics of the day. Always pushing for new ways of creating comics, Stan also inaugurated the \u201cMarvel method\u201d of plotting and art, creating some of the most iconic stories in the industry to this day.\n\nWhen something mattered to Stan, you felt it in his words, whether in an editorial or in the stories themselves. With passion for the medium, he helped refine and reform the Comics Code Authority and addressed hot-button issues like discrimination, drugs and intolerance.\n\nStan stepped up from his position as Editor-in-Chief in 1972 to tackle the role of Publisher at Marvel Comics, and while a strong succession of writers followed in his wake, his spirit and voice remained throughout the adventures that followed. His outspoken love for comics even extended to a series of college campus talks; given any chance to educate and illuminate on the industry, he took it. An entire generation of young readers expanded and strengthened their vocabulary and knowledge through Stan\u2019s stories.\n\nIn later years, Stan took on new projects of his own outside of Marvel, but always kept one eye on the universe he created, watching with pride as it continued to grow and expand. Stan worked tirelessly to promote Marvel properties and characters to the film industry, and his spunky cameos in Marvel films and television series became an important part of his legacy.\n\nOver the years, Stan was widely recognized for his remarkable accomplishments, receiving the National Medal of Arts, being inducted into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame and Jack Kirby Hall of Fame and being named a Disney Legend. He continued to work, write and enjoy life and creativity every day\u2014and the world is better for it.\n\nMarvel and the entire The Walt Disney Company salute the life and career of Stan Lee and offer their undying gratitude for his unmatchable accomplishments within their halls. Every time you open a Marvel comic, Stan will be there.\n\nPlease join us today in remembering Stan \u201cThe Man\u201d Lee.", "On an unusually frigid morning, Army Warrant Officer Silvestre Arroyo was supervising his team on Veterans Day weekend as they prepared a hot breakfast of sausage and grits.\n\nInterested in Immigration? Add Immigration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Immigration news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nHis breakfast customers are the estimated 1,000 troops now stationed at this rural outpost in southern Texas and across the Rio Grande river valley.\n\nTheir deployment is an unusual one \u2013 inside the United States, ordered by President Donald Trump days before a national election to confront a slow-moving migrant caravan he calls \u201cinvaders\u201d and a threat to national security.\n\n\u201cCreature comforts go a long way out here,\u201d said Arroyo, a father of three young children.\n\nSome 5,600 active duty troops have been deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border with the expectation that they could stay through mid-December, missing Thanksgiving with their families. Democrats have called the deployment a political farce orchestrated by Trump in a bid to galvanize his base; Republicans have pushed back, insisting that the border has long needed additional security.\n\nQuinn Owen/ABC News\n\nCamp Donna, about an hour inland from South Padre Island, is the primary Army base camp in south Texas that supports troops spread across the Rio Grande river valley. Many soldiers are in tent camps, but the military has gotten creative, too, when it comes to housing.\n\nOne unit just down the road from Camp Donna is staying in an empty retail store in Weslaco, Texas that can sleep 200 troops.\n\nNamed for the small border town nearby, Base Camp Donna sits on federal land and spans multiple football fields in size.\n\nNothing existed on this land before the military showed up. Now, there are temporary shelters, massive power generators, hot meals, medical services, even a mobile laundry unit.\n\nQuinn Owen/ABC News\n\nTemperatures in south Texas in November can fluctuate wildly \u2013 from the high 40 degrees to low 90s in a single week. Some of the tents are heated, others are not.\n\nThe primary reason for the deployment is to help the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, prepare for a caravan of migrants making their way north through Mexico. These migrants say they are fleeing crushing poverty and war in Central America and want to claim asylum inside the United States.\n\nTrump has responded not only with the military deployment but a new policy: Anyone wishing to seek asylum must do so at a designated port of entry. If caught crossing the border illegally, asylum will not be an option.\n\nTwenty miles west of Camp Donna is the Hidalgo International Bridge, which connects the tiny border town of Hidalgo, Texas to Mexico. It\u2019s the only port of entry for miles where travelers can cross on foot.\n\nFrom the barbed wire-covered pedestrian walkway, the view of the deep river valley is obscured by reinforced fences. Some of this barbed wire is new, placed there by the Army at the CBP\u2019s direction.\n\nIf the migrant caravan makes its way to the Hidalgo bridge, what they will likely see is a line.

He was 95.\n\nLee was declared dead at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, according to Kirk Schenck, an attorney for Lee's daughter, J.C. Lee.\n\nAs the top writer at Marvel Comics and later as its publisher, Lee was widely considered the architect of the contemporary comic book. He revived the industry in the 1960s by offering the costumes and action craved by younger readers while insisting on sophisticated plots, college-level dialogue, satire, science fiction, even philosophy.\n\nMillions responded to the unlikely mix of realistic fantasy, and many of his characters, including Spider-Man, the Hulk and X-Men went on to become stars of blockbuster films. He won the National Medal of Arts in 2008.\n\nRecent projects Lee helped make possible range from the films \"Avengers: Infinity War,\" ''Black Panther\" and \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" to such TV series as \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D\" and \"Daredevil.\" Lee was recognizable to his fans, having had cameos in many Marvel films and TV projects, often delivering his trademark motto, \"Excelsior!\"\n\n\"Captain America\" actor Chris Evans mourned the loss on : \"There will never be another Stan Lee. For decades he provided both young and old with adventure, escape, comfort, confidence, inspiration, strength, friendship and joy. He exuded love and kindness and will leave an indelible mark on so, so, so many lives. Excelsior!!\"\n\nLee considered the comic-book medium an art form and he was prolific: By some accounts, he came up with a new comic book every day for 10 years. \"I wrote so many I don't even know. I wrote either hundreds or thousands of them,\" he told The Associated Press in 2006.\n\nHe hit his stride in the 1960s when he brought the Fantastic Four, the Hulk, Spider-Man, Iron Man and numerous others to life. \"It was like there was something in the air. I couldn't do anything wrong,\" he said.\n\nHis heroes, meanwhile, were a far cry from virtuous do-gooders such as rival DC Comics' Superman.\n\nThe Fantastic Four fought with each other. Spider-Man was goaded into superhero work by his alter ego, Peter Parker, who suffered from unrequited crushes, money problems and dandruff. The Silver Surfer, an alien doomed to wander Earth's atmosphere, waxed about the woeful nature of man. The Hulk was marked by self-loathing. Daredevil was blind and Iron Man had a weak heart.\n\n\"The beauty of Stan Lee's characters is that they were characters first and superheroes next,\" Jeff Kline, executive producer of the \"Men in Black\" animated television series, told The Blade of Toledo, Ohio, in 1998.\n\nSome of Lee's creations became symbols of social change \u2014 the inner turmoil of Spider-Man represented '60s America, for example, while The Black Panther and The Savage She-Hulk mirrored the travails of minorities and women.\n\n\"I think of them as fairy tales for grown-ups,\" he told The AP in 2006. \"We all grew up with giants and ogres and witches. Well, you get a little bit older and you're too old to read fairy tales. But I don't think you ever outgrow your love for those kind of things, things that are bigger than life and magical and very imaginative.\"\n\nLee scripted most of Marvel's superhero comics himself during the '60s, including the Avengers and the X-Men, two of the most enduring. In 1972, he became Marvel's publisher and editorial director; four years later, 72 million copies of Spider-Man were sold.\n\n\"He's become our Mickey Mouse,\" he once said of the masked, web-crawling crusader.\n\nLee also published several books, including \"The Superhero Women\" in 1977 and \"How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way\" the following year, when he was named publisher of the year by the Periodical and Book Association of America.\n\nCBS turned the Hulk into a successful TV series, with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno portraying the doomed scientist from 1978-82. A Spider-Man series ran briefly in 1978. Both characters were featured in animated TV series as well.\n\nThe first big-budget movie based on Lee's characters, \"X-Men,\" was a smash in 2000, earning more than $130 million at North American theaters. \"Spider-Man\" did even better, taking in more than $400 million in 2002. A Marvel movie empire would emerge after that, one of the most lucrative mega-franchises in cinema history, with the recent \"Avengers: Infinity War\" grossing more than $2 billion worldwide. In 10 years, the Marvel Cinematic Universe film shave netted over $17.6 billion in worldwide grosses.\n\n\"Black Panther\" actor Winston Duke took to Twitter to pay his respects to Lee: \"You gave us characters that continue to stand the test of time and evolve with our consciousness. You taught us that there are no limits to our future as long as we have access to our imagination. Rest in power!\"\n\nStanley Martin Lieber was born Dec. 28, 1922, in New York. He grew up a fan of \"Hardy Boys\" adventure books and Errol Flynn movies, and got a job at Timely Comics after graduating from high school.\n\nWithin a few months, the editor and art director quit, leaving the 17-year-old Lee with creative control over the company, which grew and was renamed Atlas Comics and, finally, Marvel. Lieber changed his name, thinking Lee would be used for \"silly little comics\" and his real name would be reserved for novels.\n\nHis early work largely reflected popular movies \u2014 westerns, crime dramas, romance, whatever was the rage at the time. He worked for about 50 cents per page.\n\nAfter a stint in the Army during World War II, writing for training films, he was back at Marvel to begin a long and admittedly boring run of assembly line comic book production.\n\nComics in the 1950s were the subject of Senate hearings pushed by the Comics Code Authority, which frowned on gore and characters that questioned authority. Major comic book companies adopted the code as a form of self-regulation to avoid sanctions.\n\nLee said he was also working for a publisher who considered comics as fare only for children.\n\n\"One day I said, 'This is insane,'\" Lee told the Guardian in 1979. \"I'm just doing the same type of stories as everybody else. I wasn't taking pride in my work and I wanted to quit. But my wife said, 'Look, why don't you do the kind of comics you want for a change?'\"\n\nThe result was the first issue of \"The Fantastic Four,\" in 1960, with the characters, plot and text from Lee and the illustrations by famed Marvel artist Jack Kirby.\n\nThe characters were normal people changed into reluctant superheroes through no fault of their own.\n\nWriting in \"Origins of Marvel Comics,\" Lee described the quartet this way: \"The characters would be the kind of characters I could personally relate to; they'd be flesh and blood, they'd have their faults and foibles, they'd be fallible and feisty and \u2014 most important of all \u2014 inside their colorful, costumed booties they'd still have feet of clay.\"\n\n\"The Amazing Spider-Man\" followed in 1962 and before long, Marvel Comics was an industry behemoth.\n\nLee knew his work was different, proudly noting that stories were drawn out over several issues not to make money but to better develop characters, situations and themes. He didn't neglect his villains, either. One, the Moleman, went bad when he was ostracized because of his appearance, Lee wrote, adding it was \"almost unheard of in a comic book\" to explain why a character was what he was.\n\nLee's direct influence faded in the 1970s as he gave up some of his editorial duties at Marvel. But with his trademark white mustache and tinted sunglasses, he was the industry's most recognizable figure. He lectured widely on popular culture.\n\nLee moved to Los Angeles in 1981 to head Marvel Productions, an animation studio that was later purchased, along with Marvel Comics, for $50 million by New World Entertainment.\n\nAs sales of comics declined, Marvel was forced into bankruptcy proceedings that meant it had to void a lifetime contract prohibiting Lee from working for anyone else. Lee later sued Marvel for $10 million, saying the company cheated him out of millions in profits from movies based on his characters.\n\nIn 2000, Lee agreed to write stories for DC Comics, reinventing Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and other signature characters for Marvel's one-time rival. DC Vice President and Publisher Paul Levitz had nothing but praise when the agreement was made.\n\n\"With his artistic collaborators at Marvel, Stan co-created the richest imaginary universe a single comics writer has ever built,\" he said.\n\nThe dapper, friendly comic book genius continued to work into his 90s on numerous projects, including comics, films and DVDs.\n\nIn the late 1990s, he looked to capitalize on the Internet craze, offering animated \"Webisodes\" of comic-like action. Stan Lee Media also sought to reach out to Web-savvy youth through deals with pop artists the Backstreet Boys and Mary J. Blige.\n\nThe company went bankrupt, and three men were indicted for allegedly defrauding the business in a check kiting scam. Lee wasn't implicated.\n\nAfter that initial failure, Lee formed the successful Pow! Entertainment company to launch animated Internet-based projects.\n\nLee's wife and partner in nearly everything, Joan Lee, died on July 6, 2017, leaving a void that made her husband, by then in mental and physical decline, vulnerable to hangers-on who began to surround him. Lawsuits, court fights and an elder abuse investigation all emerged in the fight over who spoke for the elderly Lee.\n\nLee is survived by his daughter, Joanie, and a younger brother who also worked in comics, Larry Lieber.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer John Rogers contributed to this story", "Transcript for Town in Agoura Hills, California, burned to the ground after Woolsey wildfire\n\nThe wildfires are still burning out of control in parts of northern and Southern California so we want to get too caught up more than thirty people.

John McCain's vote against repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFirst-term Minnesota Rep. Jason Lewis argued in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece first published Sunday that McCain's vote against repealing the federal health care law last year \"killed the reform effort.\" Lewis said the vote also unleashed a wave of Democratic attack ads against Republicans across the country on health care issues.\n\nMcCain, a longtime Arizona senator, was among three Republicans to vote against the repeal legislation in the Senate.\n\nDemocrats took back control of the House after hammering Republicans on pre-existing conditions, citing the GOP's repeal efforts and an ongoing lawsuit from 20-plus Republican attorneys general to repeal former President Barack Obama's health care law. Lewis was among the Republicans unseated last week, losing his suburban Minneapolis-area seat to Democratic challenger Angie Craig.\n\nLewis argued that McCain's vote was motivated by distaste for President Donald Trump and not by policy concerns.\n\nLewis's column first appeared online on Veteran's Day. McCain \u2014 a decorated war hero, former prisoner of war and one-time Republican presidential nominee \u2014 died earlier this year of brain cancer.\n\nMcCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, called Lewis's remarks \"abhorrent\" on Twitter. Lewis's campaign manager did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nLewis is no stranger to controversy. His past career as a conservative talk show radio host was a campaign issue in his 2016 election and again during his failed 2018 bid for a second term, including years-old remarks in which he wondered aloud why he couldn't call a woman \"a slut\" and said it's not the federal government's place to ban slavery.", "Transcript for Country Music Awards Interviews, Day 1: Luke Combs\n\nMan my mama such big fan you know when I mean heck yeah I mean just run and anybody she's like.

There is a bipartisan bill waiting to be voted on in the Senate today that would make sure that the investigation is protected,\u201d Gillibrand said.\n\nShe said the new Congress needs to work toward mending its relationship with Americans and renewing their trust in their elected representatives.

Jeff Flake has led to a close race between two sitting congresswomen.\n\nRepublican Rep. Martha McSally started out with a slight lead, but as more and more votes have been counted, Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema has taken over and is widening her edge.\n\nMatt York/AP\n\nThe race has turned into more of a marathon than a sprint, with daily updates on how many votes still need to be counted in Arizona's more populous county, Maricopa.\n\nThe Maricopa County Recorder\u2019s Office, which is tasked with counting the results in Phoenix and surrounding areas, has given daily updates since Thursday. The office had about 345,000 votes to process that day, and has processed between 36,000 and 79,000 votes every day since.\n\nThe office's latest update on Sunday reported that it had about 162,000 still left to process.\n\nOther counties in the state still have votes left to process, too. As of Sunday evening, the total number of votes needed to be counted in Maricopa and five other counties was approximately 219,800, according to the regularly updated Twitter account of an analyst in the Arizona Secretary of State\u2019s office.\n\nThe current spread has Sinema winning with a lead of 32,169 votes, which puts her 1.48 percent ahead of McSally, according to the unofficial count posted on the Arizona Secretary of State\u2019s website.\n\nThe delay in processing the votes stems from Arizona\u2019s practice of allowing voters to mail in ballots up until and through Election Day. Those ballots then have to be verified based on the signature on the outside of the ballot.\n\nIf it isn\u2019t instantly matched against the signature that voter has on record, voting officials have to reach out to the voter to verify it.\n\nAnother factor adding pressure to the count is a recent court decision, which The Arizona Republic reports was prompted by a lawsuit from the state's Republican Party. It stipulates that all counties have to use the same signature verification process but only have until Wednesday to do so.\n\nRoss D. Franklin/AP\n\nMaricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes released a statement Monday afternoon reiterating that the Wednesday deadline isn\u2019t \u201cfor counting ballots\u201d but serves as a deadline for voters to verify their eligibility if they cast a provisional ballot and to verify the signatures of mailed-in ballots that were dropped off on Election Day.\n\n\u201cWe will likely continue the tabulation of ballots into the weekend,\u201d Fontes said in the statement.\n\nHerrera said there may be efforts to extend the deadline, but the status of the vote tally by Wednesday could also play a role and make an extension unnecessary.\n\n\u201cIf by Wednesday every single vote hasn\u2019t been verified, there will still be enough for a result to be known just given the margin between the two candidates,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t narrow, then, given the outstanding votes, it would be so unlikely that the vote would change that they would probably call the election anyway,\" he said. \"And if it did narrow, there may be some efforts to extend the deadline.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates have put out statements over the past week touting what they perceived as different victories from various vote counts in different counties.\n\nThe most recent statements from the campaigns came on Sunday, when McSally campaign CEO Jim Bognet released a statement saying, \u201cThe latest release provides compelling evidence that the remaining uncounted ballots are favorable to Martha. And we will continue our effort to make sure all lawful ballots are counted.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Sinema campaign manager Andrew Piatt also released a statement on Sunday arguing that her lead was \u201cinsurmountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cKyrsten has now expanded her overall lead to 32,640, or 1.52 percent, meaning McSally would have to win the remainder of Maricopa County ballots by 22 percent to take the lead in this race,\u201d Piatt said in a statement based on the numbers as of Sunday evening. \u201cThis is not plausible. Kyrsten will be declared the next U.S. Senator from Arizona.\u201d\n\nEither way, the race will be historic. Either candidate would become the state\u2019s first female senator.\n\nAnd if Sinema wins, she would become the first Democratic senator to represent the state since 1995.\n\nHerrera called this a \u201cvery unusual\u201d race, noting how \u201cturnout was high, higher than usual.\"\n\n\"And again, going into it the Republican candidate would have an advantage ... \u201d he said. \"This result is very out of the ordinary.\"", "This story is from Kaiser Health News\n\nInterested in Donald Trump?

Add Interest\n\nSince his days on the campaign trail, President Donald Trump has promised to roll back environmental regulations, boost the use of coal and pull out of the Paris climate agreement \u2014 and he\u2019s moving toward doing all those things.\n\nHe has pushed ahead with such action even as a report by the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released in October concluded that without much stronger measures to reduce the use of fossil fuels, a warming planet will witness the spread of tropical diseases, water shortages and crop die-offs affecting millions of people.\n\nSupporters of the administration\u2019s changes \u2014 some of whom are skeptical of accepted science \u2014 say the administration\u2019s moves will save money, produce jobs and give more power to states.\n\nBut critics say new strictures on scientific research and efforts to overturn standards for protecting air, water and worker safety could have long-term, widespread effects that would upend hard-won gains in environmental and public health.\n\nDerek Davis/Portland Press Herald via Getty Images\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s many environmental proposals vary widely in target and reach.\n\nFor example, the administration has delayed the implementation and enforcement of many Obama-era rules, saying they need time to draw up new rules or study some that are already on the books. Industry generally agrees, arguing these rules are an overreach with negative financial consequences. Critics fear that the delays will undermine hard-fought public health protections.\n\nAmong such efforts:\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency recently argued it needs until 2020 to decide on a controversial Obama-era directive expanding to smaller streams and waterways the types of wetlands protected by the federal Clean Water Act. That directive might mean fewer pollutants released into tributaries of larger waterways, from which millions of people get their drinking water. But the controversial rule has been fought by farming, mining and other industry groups that say it is too restrictive.\n\nThe EPA also sought to delay by nearly two years standards to protect workers and emergency responders at chemical plants, part of an Obama-era rule in response to a 2013 fire at a Texas fertilizer plant that killed 15 people. Industry says that the rule is costly and that providing information about chemical storage at plants could raise security concerns. In March 2017, then-EPA chief Scott Pruitt rejected a petition filed in 2007 by environmental groups seeking to ban a commonly used pesticide, chlorpyrifos, which the groups say harms health, particularly citing developmental damage to children and fetuses. The agency said it needed more time to study the chemical.\n\nAll three of those delays were blocked by federal court judges, although the administration may decide to appeal, so final outcomes are unclear.\n\nBut one thing is clear: Everyone is likely to spend a lot of time in court.\n\n\u201cFolks are already lining up to challenge the Affordable Clean Energy rule, and that\u2019s probably true for just about anything this administration does when it comes to environmental reform,\u201d said Nicolas Loris, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.\n\nThe clean energy rule, introduced in August, would replace a more stringent Obama-era rule for coal-burning power plants.\n\nAn EPA analysis said the proposed rule would reduce industry costs and create jobs.\n\nThe same analysis concluded, though, that the looser standards, which would supersede the never-implemented Obama-era regulation, would cause as many as 1,400 premature deaths and 15,000 new cases of upper respiratory problems annually by 2030.\n\nOn another front, scientists are protesting new Trump administration policies they say would effectively curtail their ability to study the health effects of environmental exposures.\n\nThis spring, the EPA proposed a rule dubbed Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science, which would restrict the use of studies as the basis for advancing environmental regulations if researchers have not released all their raw data, potentially including medical records.\n\nThe Trump administration said this step would ensure that data and methods can be checked for accuracy, echoing a long-running argument from industry and some in Congress.\n\nFrom scientists, though, reaction was immediate, widespread and negative. Hundreds of researchers and dozens of public health organizations said the proposal would quash important research into the effects of pollution and chemicals on health.\n\nEducation Images/UIG via Getty Images\n\nNo longer would they be able to promise confidentiality of medical records to people who take part in research studies, which would have a chilling effect on their willingness to participate.\n\nMany of the submitted comments noted that such a rule would undermine key studies that led to pollution laws and prevailing attitudes about the interaction of environmental and human health.\n\nCase in point: the seminal 1993 \u201cSix Cities\u201d research by Harvard scientists linking air pollution to premature death.\n\nThat study did not disclose the identities of its 22,000 participants or their medical information.\n\nIts findings led in 1997 to new restrictions under the Clean Air Act for fine particles, tiny pieces of soot, dust, carbon and other pollutants that get inhaled deep into the lungs, potentially causing asthma, lung cancer and other health conditions. By 2020, those rules are expected to have prevented more than 230,000 early deaths.\n\nAndrew Lichtenstein/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nScientists say the administration is handicapping their ability to do important research. The plan comes amid other efforts critics see as attacking science, such as removing information from government websites about climate change, restrictions on who can sit on EPA advisory boards and a proposal to more narrowly target safety reviews of chemicals.\n\n\u201cBy attacking the science that talks about adverse effects on health,\u201d the administration hopes to allow deregulation yet claim \u201cthey are not harming people,\u201d said Francesca Dominici, a professor of biostatistics at the Harvard\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThe range and scope of the proposed changes has brought praise from some in industry and agriculture for loosening restrictions and giving states more flexibility. But the changes frustrate public health and environmental health advocates.\n\n\u201cWe would like to be moving forward rather than fighting these kind of rollbacks,\u201d said Janice Nolen, assistant vice president for national policy at the American Lung Association.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

As they retreated toward Israel, the Israeli air force pounded the area, both governments say.\n\nHamas said six other Hamas fighters were killed and the Palestinian Health Ministry says seven additional people were injured.\n\nThe Palestinian funerals were held Monday afternoon.\n\nMenahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Israeli military says the commando, whom they only identified as Lt. Col. M., was killed and another soldier was injured. Both were brought back to Israel, the military said.\n\nIn a rare clarification of its operation, a military spokesperson said, \"The special operation yesterday was not intended to kill or abduct terrorists, but to strengthen Israeli security.\"\n\nIt did not provide other details about the operation.\n\n\"The force waged a heroic and very complex battle,\" the military added.\n\nSaid Khatib/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Israeli military says 17 rockets were launched from Gaza into Israel, and the Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted at least three of them.\n\nSirens were heard in southern Israel overnight, and school is closed Monday in the communities surrounding Gaza.\n\nThe flare-up comes at a surprising time, with the Israeli prime minister overseas speaking specifically about avoiding \"unnecessary war\" with Gaza, but also as it appeared that Hamas and Israel moved closer to a ceasefire agreement.\n\nOn Friday, Israel allowed suitcases with $15 million of Qatari cash to enter Gaza to fund salaries of civil servants in Gaza. The cash came with vital fuel for a power plant, too.\n\nMenahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFor the first time in years, some Gaza residents had eight hours of electricity, a rarity in the decade-long blockade.\n\nNetanyahu described the move as \"the right step.\"\n\n\u201cWe held serious discussions.

Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests.\"\n\nThe death toll from the wildfire that incinerated the Northern California town of Paradise and surrounding areas climbed to 42, making it the single deadliest single blaze in California history. Statewide, the number of fire dead stood at 44, including two victims in Southern California.\n\nOne reason that scientists know that management isn't to blame is that some areas now burning had fires in 2005 and 2008, so they aren't \"fuel-choked closed-canopy forests,\" Dennison said.\n\nIn those earlier fires, Paradise was threatened but escaped major damage, he said. In the current blazes, it was virtually destroyed.\n\nThe other major fire, in Southern California, burned through shrub land, not forest, Dennison said.\n\n\"It's not about forest management. These aren't forests,\" he said.\n\nThe dean of the University of Michigan's environmental school, Jonathan Overpeck, said Western fires are getting bigger and more severe. He said it \"is much less due to bad management and is instead the result of our baking of our forests, woodlands and grasslands with ever-worsening climate change.\"\n\nWildfires have become more devastating because of the extreme weather swings from global warming, fire scientists said. The average number of U.S. acres burned by wildfires has doubled over the level from 30 years ago.\n\nAs of Monday, more than 13,200 square miles (34,200 square kilometers) have burned. That's more than a third higher than the 10-year average.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1999, the United States didn't reach 10,000 square miles burned annually. Since then, 11 of 19 years have had more than 10,000 square miles burned, including this year. In 2006, 2015 and 2017, more than 15,000 square miles burned.\n\nThe two fires now burning \"aren't that far out of line with the fires we've seen in these areas in recent decades,\" Dennison said.\n\n\"The biggest factor was wind,\" Dennison said in an email. \"With wind speeds as high as they were, there was nothing firefighters could do to stop the advance of the fires.\"\n\nThese winds, called Santa Ana winds, and the unique geography of high mountains and deep valleys act like chimneys, fortifying the fires, Thornicke said.\n\nThe wind is so strong that fire breaks \u2014 areas where trees and brush have been cleared or intentionally burned to deprive the advancing flames of fuel \u2014 won't work. One of the fires jumped over eight lanes of freeway, about 140 feet (43 meters), Dennison said.\n\nSouthern California had fires similar to the Woolsey fire in 1982, when winds were 60 mph, but \"the difference between 1982 and today is a much higher population in these areas. Many more people were threatened and had to evacuated,\" Dennison said.\n\nCalifornia also has been in drought for all but a few years of the 21st century and is now experiencing its longest drought, which began on Dec. 27, 2011, and has lasted 358 weeks, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor . Nearly two-thirds of the state is abnormally dry.\n\nThe first nine months of the year have been fourth-warmest on record for California, and this past summer was the second-hottest on record in the state.\n\nBecause of that, there are 129 million dead trees, which provide fuel for fires, Thornicke said.\n\nAnd it's more than trees. Dead shrubs around the bottom of trees provide what is called \"ladder fuel,\" offering a path for fire to climb from the ground to the treetops and intensifying the conflagration by a factor of 10 to 100, said Kevin Ryan, a fire consultant and former fire scientist at the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nWhile many conservatives advocate cutting down more trees to prevent fires, no one makes money by cutting dead shrubs, and that's a problem, he said.\n\nLocal and state officials have cleared some Southern California shrub, enough for normal weather and winds. But that's not enough for this type of extreme drought, said Ryan, also a former firefighter.\n\nUniversity of Alberta fire scientist Mike Flanigan earlier this year told The Associated Press that the hotter and drier the weather, the easier it is for fires to start, spread and burn more intensely.\n\nIt's simple, he said: \"The warmer it is, the more fire we see.\"\n\nFor every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit that the air warms, it needs 15 percent more rain to make up for the drying of the fuel, Flannigan said.\n\nFederal fire and weather data show the years with the most acres burned were generally a degree warmer than average.\n\n\"Everyone who has gardened knows that you must water more on hotter days,\" Overpeck said. \"But, thanks in part to climate change, California isn't getting enough snow and rain to compensate for the unrelenting warming caused by climate change. The result is a worsening wildfire problem.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

He is reportedly also voluntarily meeting with lawyers from the New York State Attorney General's office and the District Attorney's office in Manhattan.\n\nThose discussions, sources say, have been focused on the president's business and his family's charitable foundation.\n\nIn August, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight felony counts, including tax evasion, making false statements to a bank, and campaign finance violations.\n\nThe two campaign finance violations are connected to Cohen's role in alleged hush money payments during the presidential campaign to two women who allegedly had affairs with Trump years ago.\n\nTrump has denied the allegation and maintained that he did not know about the settlement agreement until after it was signed.\n\nTrump only publicly acknowledged awareness of the payments after his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said in April on Fox News that Trump paid Cohen back for the costs associated with the Stormy Daniels deal. Giuliani contended that the payments were for purely personal reasons and that no campaign finance laws were broken.\n\nAt a plea hearing in August, Cohen told a federal judge that the payments to the women were made \"in coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office,\" referring to Trump.\n\n\"I participated in this conduct,\" Cohen said, \"for the principal purpose of influencing the election.\"\n\nTrump has long denied having affairs with the women.\n\nCohen is scheduled to be sentenced in federal court in New York on Dec. 12.", "Several thousand Central American migrants heading for the U.S. border arrived in the western Mexico city of Guadalajara with help from truckers and other motorists Monday, marking a month since their trek began.\n\nMany of the migrants boarded waiting buses at the Jalisco state line that carried them to a shelter prepared for them in the city's Benito Juarez Auditorium. Guadalajara municipal police shuttled others in patrol vehicles.\n\nThe migrants are mostly families from Honduras. At the shelter, officials had the migrants form two lines \u2014 one for families and one for men traveling alone. They were offered food and told where to go for donated clothing and free internet to contact their families.\n\nMost appear intent on taking the Pacific coast route northward to the border city of Tijuana, which is still about 1,550 miles (2,500 kilometers) away. The migrants have come about 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) since they started out in Honduras around Oct. 13.\n\nWhile they previously suffered from the heat on their journey through Honduras, Guatemala and southern Mexico, they now trek along highways wrapped in blankets to fend off the morning chill.\n\nKaren Martinez of Copan, Honduras, and her three children bundled up with jackets, scarves and a blanket.\n\n\"Sometimes we go along laughing, sometimes crying, but we keep on going,\" she said.\n\nBy late afternoon, the first migrants arrived on the outskirts of Guadalajara.\n\nWhile the caravan previously averaged only about 30 miles (50 kilometers) a day, the migrants are now covering daily distances of 185 miles (300 kilometers) or more, partly because they are relying on hitchhiking rather than walking.\n\nOn Monday morning, migrants gathered on a highway leading out of the central city of Irapuato looking for rides to Guadalajara about 150 miles (242 kilometers) away.\n\n\"Now the route is less complicated,\" Martinez said.\n\nIndeed, migrants have hopped aboard so many different kinds of trucks that they are no longer surprised by anything. Some have stacked themselves four levels high on a truck intended for pigs. On Monday, a few boarded a truck carrying a shipment of coffins, while yet others squeezed into a truck with narrow cages used for transporting chickens.\n\nMany, especially men, travel on open platform trailers used to transport steel and cars, or get in the freight containers of 18-wheelers and ride with one of the back doors open to provide air flow.\n\nThe practice is not without dangers. Earlier, a Honduran man in the caravan died when he fell from a platform truck in the Mexican state of Chiapas.\n\nJose Alejandro Caray, 17, of Yoro, Honduras, fell a week ago and injured his knee.\n\n\"I can't bend it,\" Caray said as he watched other migrants swarm aboard tractor-trailers.\n\n\"Now I'm afraid to get on,\" he said. \"I prefer to wait for a pickup truck.\"\n\nAfter several groups got lost after clambering on semi-trailers, caravan coordinators began encouraging migrants to ask drivers first or have someone ride in the cab so they could tell the driver where to turn off.\n\nOver the weekend, the central state of Queretaro reported 6,531 migrants moving through the state. A smaller caravan began arriving in Mexico City on Monday. By late afternoon, several hundred migrants had set up camp at the same sports complex the larger caravan left Saturday.\n\nThe caravan became a campaign issue in U.S. midterm elections and U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of over 5,000 military troops to the border to fend off the migrants. Trump has insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\n\nMany say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.\n\nMexico has offered refuge, asylum or work visas, and its government said Monday that 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them during the 45-day application process for more permanent status. It said about 533 migrants had requested a voluntary return to their countries.\n\nOn Monday, Mexican Interior Minister Alfonso Navarrete Prida met with other Cabinet members and the head of a business council to discuss job opportunities that could be offered to members of the caravan who decide to remain in Mexico.\n\nBut most migrants vow to continue to the United States.\n\nJose Tulio Rodriguez, 30, of Siguatepeque, Honduras, celebrated his 30th birthday at a migrant shelter in Mexico City last week before setting out with the rest of the caravan.\n\n\"The distance between cities is longer\" than it was at the start, Rodriguez noted,\" but thanks to the people of Mexico, we haven't suffered.\"\n\nThose distances will get longer the farther they travel into northern Mexico, where towns of any size are often 250 miles (400 kilometers) apart.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Gerardo Carrillo contributed to this report.", "To Viola Davis, being naked on screen or onstage means more than having your clothes off. It means ridding yourself of self-consciousness and ego. It means exposing yourself.\n\n\"Oftentimes you do see dynamic acting \u2014 there are a lot of really dynamic actors \u2014 but there is a sense of vanity,\" says Davis. \"I always say that when people get naked on stage it always looks like they've been to the gym for about five years. And we all know that's not the case. When we get naked in life, we may have some rolls of flesh around our stomach. You may have some stretch marks. Now that's intimate.\"\n\nThere was, memorably, no vanity in Davis' Rose in \"Fences,\" a performance that reached its aching crescendo in her shattering, snot-dripping \"18 years of my life\" monologue. But in Steve McQueen's electric Chicago underworld thriller \"Widows,\" Davis' raw intimacy includes a dimension she has rarely, if ever, gotten to express in film \u2014 her sexuality.\n\n\"It's a part of the strength. It's a part of the badass-ness. It's a part of the vulnerability,\" Davis, fighting a cold, said in an interview the morning after \"Widows\" premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. \"The first scene in the movie I'm in bed with Liam Neeson. That may seem like not a big deal to you but to me that was a big deal.\"\n\nIn \"Widows,\" McQueen's follow-up to the Oscar-winning \"12 Years a Slave,\" Davis stars as the wife of a veteran thief (Neeson) who dies, along with his crew, in a heist gone wrong. For their spouses, it's almost as if their lives have also been extinguished. But with Veronica Rawlins' leadership, they (the other women are played by Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki and Carrie Coon) resolve to take over their late husbands' criminal plans and pull off what none expect them capable of.\n\n\"This was a great experiment in exploring how to work out getting back your power,\" says Davis. \"In my life I'm still learning that.\"\n\nWhen a reporter points out that she \u2014 one of the most movingly outspoken advocates for on-screen representation and inclusion \u2014 seems quite in control of her considerable power, Davis demurs. \"Like everyone, I have my good moments and bad moments.\"\n\nDavis has won an Oscar (for \"Fences\"), an Emmy (for \"How to Get Away With Murder\") and a Tony, twice (for \"Fences\" and \"King Hedley II\") \u2014 a trifecta that no other black actor has accomplished, and few others, for that matter. Along the way, her impassioned acceptance speeches have been some of the most potent thunderbolts of inspiration in the wider fight for diversity, beamed out to the unrepresented and the overlooked everywhere.\n\nBut it's been almost a decade since her \"Doubt\" co-star Meryl Streep pleaded \"My God, somebody give her a movie!\" at the Screen Actors Guild Awards (and later called her \"possessed to the blazing, incandescent power\"). Since then, Davis has been a mainstay on screens big and small, but she has seldom \u2014 except in the Shonda Rhimes ABC series and now \"Widows\" \u2014 been front and center. She has even expressed some regret over 2011's \"The Help,\" noting \"it wasn't the voices of the maids that were heard.\" The same year, Davis formed a production company with her husband, the actor Julius Tennon, with whom she has an eight-year-old daughter.\n\nFor McQueen, Davis' lack of leading performances is one of the most glaring injustices in Hollywood.\n\n\"She can only be judged by the films she gets to do. Don't forget: she could not really make a living in film because no one was giving her any roles,\" McQueen said by phone. \"She was not given an opportunity to fulfill her craft. So she had to go on television. Viola's 53 years old. She should have a vast body of work by now.\"\n\nDoes Davis feel the same way?\n\n\"I mean, yeah,\" she sighs. \"I sort of feel that sometimes. But I'm honored that I've gotten to this point. This is a very privileged life. I feel like if I sit here and I say, 'I should have had more lead roles,' some dissatisfaction with the moment \u2014 I can't do that. I really can't.\"\n\nDavis, the fifth of their six children, grew up impoverished, in dilapidated homes in Rhode Island, the daughter of an alcoholic father who was abusive to Davis' mother.\n\n\"I became an actor because I was an observer. It's said that actors are observers and they're thieves. You observe life and then you steal from it,\" says Davis. \"The beauty of how I grew up is I saw so many horrific but glorious things happen in public. When you grow up poor, nothing is undercover. You hear everything played out because people are living in close proximity to each other. You know who the alcoholic is. You know who's getting beaten by their husband.\"\n\nDavis has said before that she's motivated to honor the dreams of her \"eight-year-old self.\" ''She's always sitting there,\" says Davis. \"And, really, it's easy to make her happy, whereas it's sort of hard to make me happy now.\" And she lets out a belly laugh.\n\nThat upbringing has informed how Davis has responded to the #MeToo movement: applauding it, encouraging it, but also fearing that its focus on Hollywood actresses and executives is limited. She cites her long-running involvement with Gail Abarbanel's Rape Treatment Center at the Stuart House as the kind of place that needs support.\n\n\"It's much bigger than a hashtag,\" she says.\n\n\"Widows,\" penned by McQueen and Gillian Flynn (\"Gone Girl\") is based on Lynda La Plante's 1980s British series, but its tale of female empowerment has obvious connections to today. In rehearsals, McQueen would sit with Davis and the other actresses and talk through their own experiences. \"All the things in our lives that we felt people didn't see,\" says Davis. \"Like my femininity.\"\n\nMcQueen wanted to bring all of those stories to the table. Davis would have preferred to wear a wig but McQueen disagreed. He wanted Davis to look just how she is. \"I know this woman,\" McQueen told her. \"She just hasn't been in the American cinema. So it's about time we introduced her.\"\n\nDavis has made such introductions a regularity, bringing one African-American woman after another to a screen where they didn't before exist.\n\n\"My big thing \u2014 this is my ego \u2014 I always want people to look back at this time and I want my name to be in it. I always want to be in the conversation,\" she says. \"Not just in movies, just in terms of people seeing themselves differently.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP", "Transcript for WWI armistice centennial, wildfires, clashes in Spain: World in Photos\n\nAnd it.

The photo of more than 60 male students dressed in suits shows many with their right arm extended upward while posed on the steps of the Sauk County Courthouse.\n\nMueller did not say what occasion may have brought the students together, but said the photo appears to have been taken last spring; some of the boys are wearing boutonnieres. Mueller said it wasn't taken on school grounds or at a school-sponsored event.\n\n\"The school district is investigating this situation and is working with parents, staff and local authorities. If the gesture is what it appears to be, the district will pursue any and all available and appropriate actions, including legal, to address the issue,\" Mueller said in a letter to parents and guardians.\n\nThe photo spread quickly on Twitter Sunday night and Monday morning with the hashtag #barabooproud, which is often used by the district to promote its activities and athletic programs.\n\nThe Baraboo Police Department said it was assisting with the district's investigation.\n\nThe photo drew widespread condemnation, including from the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum in Poland and a state senator who represents Baraboo, a town of about 12,000 residents that's about 115 miles (185 kilometers) northwest of Milwaukee.\n\n\"This is why every single day we work hard to educate. We need to explain what is the danger of hateful ideology rising. Auschwitz with its gas chambers was at the very end of the long process of normalizing and accommodating hatred,\" the Auschwitz Memorial tweeted .\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jon Erpenbach, whose district includes Baraboo, suggested teenagers are taking their cues from President Donald Trump.\n\n\"There's no room in the world for anything like that at all. From what they're seeing out of the White House, that it's OK to be intolerant and racist. Never is. Never was. Never will be,\" Erpenbach said.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to an email for comment seeking a response to Erpenbach.\n\nDemocratic Gov.-elect Tony Evers said the actions in the photo \"have no place in Wisconsin\" and added: \"Intolerance and bigotry must never be tolerated, in our schools or anywhere else.\"\n\nGOP Gov. Scott Walker didn't immediately issue a statement, and a spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA group called Baraboo Young Professionals organized a rally at the county courthouse for Monday afternoon. In a Facebook post, Sherri Schaaf invited people to \"bring our best symbols of love ... and let's #SpreadMoreLoveThanHate!\"\n\nIt's not the first time Baraboo High School students have been accused of using racially controversial symbols. In 2012, a group of students drove trucks around displaying Confederate battle flags to commemorate a friend who was killed in a car crash. The students removed the flags at the request of school officials. Many associate the flag with slavery, segregation and white supremacy.\n\nA week before last week's midterm elections, area residents received white nationalist propaganda in their mailboxes.

While other officials implicated in the plot have fled the country, the former intelligence chief is now residing in northern Ethiopia and should turn himself in to authorities, he said.\n\nYilikal Getnet, an opposition figure, told The Associated Press the public had demanded the arrests of the former officials.\n\n\"These have been issues that we in the opposition have long been calling for, too,\" he said, adding that Ethiopia needs a truth and reconciliation process to investigate past misdoings. \"The ruling party alone can't bring justice for all these atrocities committed in the past.\"\n\nUnder the previous government, Ethiopia, a close security ally of the West, used to be accused of rights violations by human rights activists. Since Abiy, 42, came to power in April his new government has released several thousand political prisoners, permitted exiled opposition groups to return home, dropped terror charges against prominent opposition politicians and permitted the media to operate more freely.\n\nDespite the reforms, ethnic-based clashes are continuing in some parts of Ethiopia and pose the most serious threat to Abiy's leadership of this East African nation of 100 million people.\n\nAmnesty International welcomed the arrests.\n\n\"These arrests are an important first step toward ensuring full accountability for the abuses that have dogged the country for several decades,\" said Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International's East Africa Director. \"Many of these officials were at the helm of government agencies infamous for perpetrating gross human rights violations, such as torture and the arbitrary detention of people including in secret facilities. We urge the government of Prime Minister Abiy to take further steps to ensure justice and accountability for all past human rights violations and abuses, while at the same time ensuring all the individuals arrested receive fair trials.\"", "Congo's two leading opposition parties withdrew from a pact to support a single presidential contender on Monday, significantly weakening efforts to defeat the ruling party candidate backed by long-time President Joseph Kabila.\n\nThe dramatic development came less than 24 hours after representatives of the Central African nation's opposition parties announced in Geneva that they had collectively chosen Martin Fayulu Madidi to face ruling party candidate Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary in the Dec. 23 vote.\n\nAmong the three top contenders not chosen was Felix Tshisekedi, son of the late opposition icon Etienne Tshisekedi. The elder Tshisekedi helped found the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, known as the UDPS, and led political efforts against Kabila until dying in February 2017.\n\nSunday's announcement of Fayulu's candidacy has prompted uproar in the UDPS ranks, even prompting some to set tires ablaze in the capital, Kinshasa.\n\n\"I have realized that the action we took in Geneva was not understood by the party base,\" he announced on Top Congo FM radio Monday evening. \"As a result I am removing my signature in the name of UDPS from this agreement we have signed in Geneva.\"\n\nFayulu, a 62-year-old legislator, had supported Etienne Tshisekedi in the 2011 presidential election.\n\nAnother prominent opposition party, the UNC led by Vital Kamerhe, also said it was withdrawing from the pact.\n\nThe moves mark a serious setback for opposition efforts to unify before the election.\n\nKabila has been in power since 2001 and his mandate expired in late 2016.

Years ago, DeKalb County Police Sergeant David Fraser\u2019s department was on the hunt for a cat burglar prowling neighborhoods in the county. With about eight burglaries, the case became a priority, so the department set up a community meeting. \"When we walked away from that meeting, we had 15 more incidents we were never aware of,\" Fraser recalled.\n\nIt\u2019s a fact of life in law enforcement: for a wide array of reasons, an estimated 52.6 percent of violent crime-related injuries go unreported, according to the Department of Justice.\n\n\"You\u2019re talking about a burglar that breaks into your house while you\u2019re at home asleep!\" Fraser added. \"Some people think 'well I just don\u2019t want to bother the police.' I don\u2019t know what they think.\"\n\nFraser said such episodes are indelible in the minds of his police colleagues. Police departments can only hold so many community meetings, and even then departments can\u2019t expect some of the people most vulnerable to crime, or most wary of police, to show up and speak out. When Fraser learned about an innovative new policing technique in the United Kingdom approaching the problem of unreported crime from an entirely new angle, he reached out to the federal agency headquartered in his own county, the CDC, to see if he could bring it here.\n\nEmergency Rooms are a window into violent altercations in communities that law enforcement never learn about. Medical professionals treating the wounded have a duty to keep identifiable personal information private; unless the incident is legally mandated as reportable (involving firearms, or domestic violence) that rich trove of data is lost. Cardiff, Wales based surgeon Jonathan Shepherd realized hospital staff could ask patients about where and when incidents occurred, helping create anonymized spatiotemporal crime maps.\n\nFinding far more crimes than Cardiff police knew about, they say these hospital-generated maps of violent incidents richly enhanced police and community understanding of crime by making trends much clearer. Cardiff's community board quickly realized how frequently intoxicated men threw or swung glass containers, so they asked bars to swap glass out for plastic. When they found many men were ending up in fights after bumping into each other on packed sidewalks, Cardiff opened up more streets to foot traffic.\n\nAfter four years working with hospital-augmented crime maps this way, Cardiff reduced violent altercations causing wounds by 42 percent compared to similar U.K. cities.\n\nSgt. Fraser and his DeKalb colleagues met with London police and learned about how these hospital-police-community partnerships, termed the \"Cardiff Model,\" became standard nationwide. With funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a partnership was formed between the CDC, Grady Hospital and DeKalb County police to pilot a version here, called the United States Injury Prevention Partnership. While also underway in Philadelphia, Atlanta is the first to publish data, and the numbers are eye-opening.\n\nThe data revealed that 83.2 percent of injury-causing crimes went unreported to police in one Atlanta jurisdiction, and 93.1 percent in another, numbers far higher than the Department of Justice\u2019s official estimates.\n\nDeKalb County police consider this new data source a win-win scenario.\n\n\"We're getting this extra data, but because it's anonymized and there are no identifiers, it doesn't count against us for Uniform Crime Reporting and it doesn't add to our workload significantly... this is like icing on top of the cake,\" Fraser said.\n\n\"The secret sauce of this is not the hospital, it\u2019s not the police department, it\u2019s the community,\" said Grady ER physician Dr. Daniel Wu, who co-authored the study and noted that it gives the community invaluable insight about where to direct its attention.\n\nThe partnership hopes to see similar initiatives expand nationwide.\n\nDr. Ford Vox practices rehabilitation medicine at the Shepherd Center in Atlanta and contributes to the ABC News Medical Unit.", "When the deadly Camp Fire started to close in on Feather River Hospital in the Northern California town of Paradise, nurses were forced to evacuate their critically sick patients without warning.\n\nInterested in Wildfires?

She ran up a hill and got into the next car she found.

Here's what we do, as well as smart frugal tips from others:\n\nBUDGET FOR EVERY EXPENSE\n\nBy early November, I set up a spreadsheet with budgeted amounts for:\n\n- Gifts, with names and how much we expect to spend on each person.\n\n- Holiday tips, again with names and amounts.\n\n- Travel expenses, including gas, hotel and meals.\n\n- The tree, lights and other decorations.\n\n- Food, drinks and treats for holiday gatherings.\n\n- Holiday cards, postage and wrapping supplies.\n\nSpreadsheets aren't exactly warm, fuzzy and cinnamon-scented. But they allow us to see our total expected holiday spending and to make adjustments as necessary. (Adjustments are always necessary.)\n\nWe've used various ideas over the years to curb expenses, as our fortunes and the size of family gatherings change. One year the adults drew names for gifts. We've also asked friends and more distant relatives to exchange cards instead of presents. We set an overall budget for our daughter's presents, then have her prioritize her wish list. Learning to prioritize is an important life skill, so this exercise does double parenting duty.\n\nCHECK THE 'CUSHIONS'\n\nRemember the days when you ransacked the couch cushions for loose change? There are better places to hunt for forgotten money. Some places to look:\n\nYOUR GIFT CARD STASH. Pass them along, use them to buy presents or cash them in at sites such as Gift Card Granny or Raise.\n\nCREDIT CARD REWARDS. Rewards points can be used to buy gift cards and merchandise. We typically use our rewards for travel, but I sometimes turn points from little-used or orphaned accounts into gift cards.\n\nTHE COIN JAR. Some banks and credit unions will count change for free, or you can use the CoinStar machines found at many grocery and drugstores. We avoid CoinStar's exchange fee by opting for electronic gift cards from Amazon, Starbucks and other retailers.\n\nTHE GIFT STASH. Surely I'm not the only person to tuck away the perfect gift for someone, only to find it years later. Now I keep a bin in the closet to stash presents year-round. The bin also includes some all-purpose gifts (candles, scented soaps, fancy corkscrews) that can be used to thank a hostess or give to the friend who ignored the \"no gifts this year\" agreement.\n\nTHE HEIRLOOMS. Consider passing along a treasured object while you're still around to enjoy the recipients' pleasure. It could be something you inherited or that the other person admired: a piece of artwork or jewelry, a beloved toy, a musical instrument, a grandparent's toolbox or baking supplies.\n\nTAKE A HATCHET TO OTHER EXPENSES\n\nOur holiday spending surge requires cutting other expenses to keep our budget in balance. Ahead of the holidays, we:\n\n- Eat out less and plan meals that mostly use items from our pantry.\n\n- Scour our recurring bills for possible savings, such as pausing subscriptions or canceling an unused gym membership.\n\n- Look for cheap entertainment, such as free community concerts or baking cookies with friends.\n\nWe're also changing how we make charitable donations, since the 2017 tax overhaul likely means we'll no longer get a tax deduction. Instead of rushing to make big year-end contributions, we've set up monthly payments to our favorite charities. That provides them with a steady source of income and avoids another big December dent in our budget.\n\nKEEP THE BUDGET UPDATED\n\nA budget should be a living document, regularly updated and adjusted. I log our spending every week or so and use apps such as Santa's Bag or Christmas List that I can update on my phone.\n\nThis approach does more than keep us honest about our spending. At the end of the season, I have a realistic idea of how much to save for next year. I divide that total by 12, and set up a monthly transfer to an online savings account labeled \"Christmas.\" Having the money to pay for the holidays in cash every year may be the best gift of all.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis column was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet .\n\nLiz Weston is a columnist at NerdWallet, a certified financial planner and author of \"Your Credit Score.\" Email: lweston@nerdwallet.com .

I think they also have a right to be hopeful.\"\n\nThe bishops are meeting through Wednesday in Baltimore and had been expected to consider several steps to combat abuse, including a new code of conduct for themselves and the creation of a special commission, including lay experts, to review complaints against the bishops.\n\nThe bishops plan to proceed with discussing these proposals, which were drafted in September by the bishops' Administrative Committee. Cardinal Blase J. Cupich, of Chicago, suggested the bishops could hold a non-binding vote on the proposals while in Baltimore and then convene a special assembly for a formal vote after considering the results of the global meeting in February.\n\n\"I realize that another meeting will create logistical challenges for the conference staff and the bishops' schedules, but there is a grave urgency to this matter and we cannot delay,\" Cupich said.\n\nAbuse scandals have roiled the Roman Catholic Church worldwide for decades, but there have been major developments this year in the U.S.\n\nIn July, Pope Francis removed U.S. church leader Theodore McCarrick as a cardinal after church investigators said an allegation that he groped a teenage altar boy in the 1970s was credible. Subsequently, several former seminarians and priests reported they too had been abused or harassed by McCarrick as adults, triggering debate over who might have known and covered up McCarrick's misconduct.\n\nIn August, a grand jury report in Pennsylvania detailed decades of abuse and cover-up in six dioceses, alleging more than 1,000 children had been abused over the years by about 300 priests. Since then, a federal prosecutor in Philadelphia has begun working on a federal criminal case centered on child exploitation, and attorneys general in several other states have launched investigations.\n\nDiNardo, in his address opening the bishops' assembly, told survivors of clergy abuse he was \"deeply sorry.\"\n\n\"Some would say this is entirely a crisis of the past. It is not,\" DiNardo said. \"We must never victimize survivors over again by demanding they heal on our timeline.\"\n\nAfter DiNardo's address, the bishops adjourned to a chapel for a daylong session of prayer that includes remarks by two survivors of clergy abuse who have worked to promote healing and reconciliation among other victims.\n\n\"Please understand the heart of the church is broken and you need to fix this now,'\" Luis A. Torres Jr. told the bishops. \"You were not called to be CEOs... You were not called to be princes. Be the priests that you were called to be. Please act now. Be better. Be good.\"\n\nOutside the conference hall, news of the delay in voting angered some protesters who were demanding the bishops take strong action against abuse.\n\n\"I know that they answer to the Holy See, but there's a bigger imperative here, which is that children and victims need them to step forward,\" said Anne Barrett Doyle, who works at the abuse database BishopAccountability.org. \"By complying so meekly with what the pope has demanded of them today, they are surrendering their responsibility.\"\n\nLiz McCloskey, part of a coalition of concerned Catholics called the 5 Theses movement that has posted its proposals for reform on church doors in Baltimore and other cities, said the stakes couldn't be higher. She said Catholics were \"leaving in droves\" in the absence of significant reforms and full transparency.\n\n\"Delaying taking any action in response to the sex abuse scandal is not only a public relations nightmare but a moral failing,\" McCloskey told The Associated Press.\n\nHer group's proposals for the bishops include cooperating fully with investigations and releasing names of credibly accused clergy, committing to shedding regalia and living simply, and asking Pope Francis to put women in leadership posts.\n\nDiNardo said the bishops didn't complete a final draft of their proposed anti-abuse actions until Oct. 30 and the Vatican, with relatively short notice, sought to delay voting because of potential legal complications.\n\nNonetheless, John Gehring, the Catholic program director at a Washington-based clergy network called Faith in Public Life, said the Vatican \"just made a big mistake.\"\n\n\"The optics are terrible, and it sends a message, intended or not, that Rome doesn't recognize the urgency of the moment,\" Gehring tweeted .\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nCrary reported from New York.", "The Latest on Europe's migration crisis (all times local):\n\n6:50 p.m.\n\nBulgarian officials are signaling the country will not sign a global pact to promote safe and orderly migration, saying that it would harm national interests.\n\nThe floor leader of the main ruling center-right GERB party in parliament, Tsvetan Tsvetanov, said after a meeting of the ruling coalition that \"the position of the Bulgarian government will be not to join the United Nations' global pact on migration.\"\n\nGERB's coalition partner, the United Patriots, strongly opposes the U.N. pact, saying it poses a threat to national interests.\n\nBulgaria's parliament will debate the pact on Wednesday. The ruling coalition holds a thin majority of 122 legislators in the 240-seat chamber.\n\nThe Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, which won't be legally binding, was finalized under U.N. auspices in July. It is due to be formally approved at a Dec. 11-12 meeting in Marrakech, Morocco.\n\nBulgaria's government has adopted a tough stance against mass migration to Europe.

The Conservative government has an oft-stated but long-unmet goal of reducing net immigration below 100,000 people a year, less than half the current level.\n\nThe government has faced criticism over policies designed to make the U.K. a \"hostile environment\" for illegal immigration. Critics say it has led to legal residents of the country prevented from getting housing, jobs and health care. In some cases individuals have faced deportation.\n\nThe data-sharing agreement, quietly signed in 2016, gave the government access to addresses and other personal information collected by family doctors, though not to clinical data.\n\nDoctors who work with refugees and asylum-seekers described the move as a major breach of medical ethics, saying physicians should not be responsible for enforcing immigration rules.\n\nLeading medical organizations including the Royal College of General Practitioners, Public Health England and the General Medical Council all slammed the data-sharing deal.\n\nThe Home Office, the government department responsible for immigration, said it was working with NHS Digital \"on a new memorandum of understanding to enable us to make requests for non-medical information about those facing deportation action because they have committed serious crimes, or where information is necessary to protect someone's welfare.\"", "Chinese Premier Li Keqiang stressed the need for free trade on Monday, as he drew similarities between his country and Singapore, a bustling regional hub.\n\n\"China and Singapore have a special cooperative relationship because there are profound cultural and people-to-people exchanges between us,\" Li said.\n\n\"We both safeguard multilateralism and free trade.

He is to deliver a lecture on Singapore-China relations and regional development, and participate in a summit of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\n\nChina is locked in a simmering trade dispute with the U.S., which accuses it of violating its market-opening obligations, and the two countries have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of each other's goods.\n\nSingapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted on Monday that exactly 40 years had passed since then Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping visited the city-state.\n\nThe countries have worked together on a string of projects since then, including the Suzhou Industrial Park and the Tianjin Eco-city, he said.\n\nLee said China and ASEAN \"share a common interest in upholding an open, rules-based multilateral order.\"\n\n\"Singapore and China are like-minded partners in many areas even though we have different circumstances and constraints,\" he added.\n\n\"But I believe we can continue to tap into our complementary strengths, deepen cooperation and make sure that our all-around cooperative partnership continues to progress with the times.\"\n\nChina and Singapore signed 11 memoranda of understanding on Monday.

There was no immediate comment from the Pakistani government.\n\nKhalilzad is on his second regional tour since being appointed, with stops in Pakistan, Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates as well as Qatar, where the Taliban maintain a political office. The insurgents say they met Khalilzad in Qatar last month. Khalilzad arrived in the region last Thursday and will return to Washington on Nov. 20.\n\nWhen Khalilzad was last in the region Pakistan released another Taliban leader, Abdul Ghani Baradar, one of the founders of the radical religious movement. Baradar was arrested in 2010 in a joint U.S. and Pakistani operation. At the time, it was reported Baradar was taken into custody by Pakistan after he tried to open independent peace talks with Afghanistan's then-president, Hamid Karzai.\n\nIn a recent interview, Karzai told The Associated Press he had repeatedly tried to secure Baradar's release but he was thwarted by both Pakistan and the U.S., who wanted him detained because of his stature within the Taliban.\n\nBaradar's release has been a long-standing demand of the Taliban.\n\nEfforts to find a peaceful end to Afghanistan's protracted war have accelerated in recent months, as a troop surge announced by President Donald Trump last August has done little to change conditions on the ground. In recent months the Taliban have carried out near-daily attacks on Afghan security forces as well as coordinated assaults on major cities.\n\nThe Taliban have long demanded direct talks with the United States, referring to the Kabul government as puppets. Washington has neither confirmed nor denied a meeting between Khalilzad and the Taliban took place last month.\n\nTaliban officials present at the meeting characterized those talks as productive. They said they pressed to have their office in Qatar recognized and agreed to meet again, although no date was set.\n\nAfghanistan's fractious government, which is jointly headed by President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, has been prickly about direct talks between Washington and the Taliban.\n\nIn addition to the three Taliban figures recently freed by Pakistan, five senior members of the Taliban who were freed from the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay in 2014 in exchange for captured U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl have joined the insurgent group's political office in Qatar.\n\nThe induction of the five has significantly strengthened the ability of the Taliban's Qatar office to sell a peace deal to insurgents on the battlefield.\n\nSani's release further reconstitutes the Taliban leadership. Sani was placed on the U.S. terrorist list in January, accused of supplying the Taliban with weapons as well as being a major financier travelling to the Gulf to obtain both money and supplies for the insurgent movement.", "Interested in North Korea? Add North Korea as an interest to stay up to date on the latest North Korea news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nU.S. analysts said Monday they have located 13 secret North Korean missile development sites, underscoring the challenge that the Trump administration faces in trying to reach its promised broad arms control agreement with Pyongyang.\n\nThe administration has said it is hopeful about eventually reaching an agreement with North Korea. President Donald Trump declared after his historic summit in June that with President Kim Jong Un there was \"no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.\" But a report based on satellite imagery shows the complexity posed by an extensive network of weapons facilities that the U.S. wants to neutralize.\n\nA report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies has identified 13 secret facilities used to produce missiles and related technology. Although the sites are not launch facilities and in some cases are rudimentary, the authors of the report say they are hidden and illustrate the scope of the North's weapons program and the country's determination to conceal its military might.\n\n\"The dispersed deployment of these bases and distinctive tactics employed by ballistic missile units are combined with decades of extensive camouflage, concealment and deception practices to maximize the survival of its missile units from pre-emptive strikes and during wartime operations,\" they said.\n\nThe authors say the sites, which can be used for all classes of ballistic missiles, should be declared by North Korea and inspected in any credible, verifiable deal that addresses Pyongyang's most significant threats to the United States and its allies.\n\nSouth Korea's presidential office said the report didn't include any information it didn't already know. Presidential spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said continued activity at North Korean missile sites only underlines the need for nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang to proceed at a faster pace.\n\nKim took exception to a New York Times article on the report that said North Korea was engaging in \"great deception,\" saying that the North has never promised to dismantle a short-range ballistic missile base 135 kilometers (84 miles) northwest of Seoul that was highlighted by CSIS.\n\nKim said such suggestions can \"trigger misunderstanding and potentially block dialogue ... at a time when we need dialogue between North Korea and the United States.\"\n\nSeoul has worked hard to revive nuclear negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea that have reduced fears of war in South Korea following a series of North Korean weapons tests and threats of military action by Trump last year.\n\nNorth Korea analysts not involved in the report said the findings were not surprising given Pyongyang's past activities but were still cause for concern. They noted that Kim had not agreed to halt either nuclear weapons or missile development in negotiations with Trump or Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\n\"The fact that North Korea has continued to build nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in the midst of high-level diplomacy with China, South Korea and the U.S. should not come as a surprise,\" said Abraham Denmark, the Asia program director at The Wilson Center. \"Despite all the summitry, North Korea is just as dangerous today as it was a year ago.\"\n\n\"Improving relations with Pyongyang may be a laudable goal, but any claim that the North Korean nuclear and missile threats have been solved is either wishful thinking or purposefully deceptive,\" he said.\n\n\"Interesting but unsurprising report,\" said Kelsey Davenport, director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association. \"Kim Jong Un only committed voluntarily to halt long-range missile tests.\"\n\nThe report was released less than a week after North Korea abruptly called off a new round of negotiations with Pompeo that had been set for Thursday in New York. The cancellation, which the U.S. ascribed to scheduling issues, followed threats from North Korean officials to resume nuclear and missile testing unless U.S. sanctions are lifted.\n\nThe administration has said repeatedly that sanctions will not be lifted until a denuclearization agreement is fully implemented.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to this report.", "A prolonged drought followed by a welcomed spike in rain and another dry spell has created a \"recipe for destruction\" that's manifesting itself in wildfires of historic proportions raging in California, leveling thousands of homes and killing at least 31 people, a state fire official told ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Monday.\n\nWith blazes burning in both Northern and Southern California, firefighters on the front lines are being pushed to the brink, many working 24-hour shifts to bring the infernos under control, said Batallion Chief Lucas Spellman of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as Cal Fire.\n\n\"We're all very exhausted.

Al-Falih, who on Sunday said the kingdom would cut production by more than 500,000 barrels per day in December, said Saudi Arabia gave customers \"100 percent of what they asked for.\" That appeared to be a veiled reference to Trump.\n\nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 78 cents to $59.15 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Otherwise, the ownership will be transferred to the local government.\n\nLast month, U.N. humanitarian aid official Jan Egeland said that Syria's government had withdrawn the law, saying he was told of the decision by Russia, a key ally of Assad that tipped the balance of power in his favor since joining the war three years ago.\n\nThe Syrian government passed Law 10 in April to create \"redevelopment zones\" to rebuild property damaged in seven years of civil war.\n\nPrior to the latest amendment, Human Rights Watch had said the government passed laws in order to seize private property, displace residents and discourage refugees from returning.\n\nThe new draft says property owners will have to put forward an application giving their residency address along with the documents proving ownership or a list of properties.\n\nSANA quoted Hussein Makhlouf, minister of local administration, as saying that the amendments give citizens enough time to put forward documents regarding their ownership.\n\nA third of Syria's housing has been destroyed in the last seven years, according to Human Rights Watch.

Rajapaksa, who was president from 2005 to 2015, is considered a hero by some in Sri Lanka's ethnic Sinhalese majority because he oversaw the end of a 25-year civil war by crushing ethnic minority Tamil rebels in 2009.\n\nBut his time in power was marred by allegations of war-time atrocities, corruption and nepotism.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBUILDING TENSIONS\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister.\n\nWickremesinghe's government came under fire last year after handing over operations of a port to a Chinese company in a 99-year lease that the previous government had built in Rajapaksa's home district with Chinese loans. Rajapaksa described the deal to his left-leaning supporters as a bid by Wickremesinghe to privatize national assets. Wickremesinghe said in an interview with The Associated Press that the deal helped the country avoid defaulting on debts accumulated during Rajapaksa's presidency.\n\nSirisena has accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, a charge that Wickremesinghe has repeatedly denied and that so far has not led to any arrests.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nA POWER PLAY\n\nOn Oct. 26, the alliance between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe formally fell apart, with Sirisena naming Rajapaksa the new prime minister and suspending Parliament.\n\nAfter a week of upheaval, Sirisena announced he was dissolving Parliament and calling snap elections due on Jan. 5. He later explained in a nationally televised address that he dissolved Parliament out of fear that lawmakers would come to blows over his Oct. 26 decision.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nREFUSING TO STAND DOWN\n\nWickremesinghe has been holed up in the prime minister's official residence in Colombo \u2014 surrounded by a skeleton security crew, supporters and Buddhist monks \u2014 since he was ousted and maintains he is the country's rightful leader. He has repeatedly called for Parliament to be reconvened so that he could prove his majority support among the country's 225 lawmakers.\n\nHe alleges that the snap election was called only when it became clear that Rajapaksa had failed to lure enough lawmakers to his side with offers of cash and jobs and would lose any confidence vote in Parliament.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nA CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION\n\nThere is debate over whether Sirisena's Oct. 26 move was legal.\n\nHe has cited a general clause in Sri Lanka's Constitution stating that the president has the power to summon or suspend Parliament.\n\nSupreme Court petitioners challenging Sirisena's actions argue that a specific clause in the 19th amendment, added in 2015, stipulates that Parliament can't be dissolved until 4 1/2 years after its election, unless 2/3 of Parliament requests it happen sooner. The current Parliament was elected in August 2015.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWHO'S RUNNING SRI LANKA\n\nSirisena and Rajapaksa formed a Cabinet of party loyalists and government defectors within days of the Oct. 26 shakeup. They quickly cut fuel prices, a popular measure among those who blamed the Wickremesinghe-led government for Sri Lanka's sluggish economy.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTHE PUBLIC REACTS\n\nMembers of Wickremesinghe's political coalition, supporters and chanting Buddhist monks quickly set up camp in a hall at the prime minister's official residence after Sirisena withdrew most of Wickremesinghe's security personnel.\n\nFour days into the crisis, at least 10,000 people marched through central Colombo demanding that Sirisena summon Parliament.\n\nSirisena and Rajapaksa responded by organizing a massive rally on Nov. 5, with politicians from their party bringing busloads of constituents into Colombo. Police estimated at least 120,000 attended.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nINTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATION\n\nThe U.S. has said that Sirisena's decision to dissolve Parliament \"poses a vital threat to Sri Lanka's democratic institutions.\" Colombo-based diplomats from Australia, the U.K. and the European Union also issued statements calling for the country's constitution and democracy to be respected.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has offered to moderate discussions between Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe. On Sunday, he urged the government to respect \"democratic processes and institutions.\"\n\nChina and India have been careful not to take an overt position in Sri Lanka, which has been a battleground in their struggle for geopolitical supremacy in South Asia.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\nPetitioners asked the Supreme Court on Monday to declare Sirisena's decrees null and void. That decision could come as early as Tuesday.\n\nBoth Rajapaksa and Sirisena have said they will face the Jan. 5 election together.\n\nSirisena suggested on Sunday that he could have Wickremesinghe forcibly removed from the prime minister's residence.", "Transcript for Timelapse footage captures Malibu wildfire as seen from Venice Beach\n\n--\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "The latest on developments in financial markets (all times local):\n\n4 p.m.\n\nStock trading turned jittery again after two weeks of gains, pulling the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 600 points.\n\nTechnology stocks took some of the biggest losses Monday.

It said 12 bodies have been found on the boats.\n\nWinds and water currents push dozens of \"ghost boats\" on to Japan's northern coasts annually. Rickety North Korean fishing boats are particularly vulnerable because they lack the sturdiness and equipment to return home.\n\nJapanese authorities have stepped up patrols as the number of ship arrivals has soared in recent years.\n\nThe increase may be related to a North Korean campaign to boost fish harvests to increase sources of protein for the nation, which is struggling to achieve food self-sufficiency and to overcome health problems caused by poor diets, experts say. To reach their quotas, North Korean fishermen may be taking more risks and venturing farther from their usual waters, possibly violating Japan's 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone, they say.\n\nMore than one-third of the boats this year have arrived on Japan's northern main island of Hokkaido, possibly because of attempts to travel further north to evade patrols by Japan's coast guard.\n\nThe influx of ghost boats has also raised security concerns.

Rick Scott, who's running for U.S. Senate against Sen. Bill Nelson, and former Rep. Ron DeSantis, who's running for governor against Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, should be declared the winners of their respective races.\n\nThe Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2018\n\nBut the president's desire to use results from Election Night, which he tweeted on Veterans Day, would disenfranchise many voters whose ballots are counted after Election Day, including voters serving overseas in the military. Overseas and military ballots can arrive until Nov. 16 and will be counted, as long as they're postmarked on or before Election Day.\n\nAdditionally, there is no evidence that ballots \"showed up out of nowhere,\" but rather ballots continued to be counted days after the election -- largely mail-in, absentee and provisional ballots in slow counties like Broward and Palm Beach, which lean Democrat. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement, or FDLE, has no open investigations into any claims of potential fraud, ABC News confirmed Sunday afternoon.\n\nFlorida's Attorney General Pam Bondi, on the shortlist to become Trump's U.S. attorney general, wrote to the head of the FDLE over the weekend imploring that he pursue an investigation, citing reports that Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes mixed 22 invalid ballots in with a batch of 205 provisional ballots submitted to the Florida secretary of state's office. Bondi called the FDLE Commissioner Rick Swearingen's decision not to investigate \"wholly incompatible\" with the allegations made.\n\nJoe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nThe president has made claims of improper election results before, most notably after the 2016 election, when he said there were more than three million illegal votes cast -- about the same number more votes Hillary Clinton received in the popular vote. However, his own voter fraud commission disbanded over the summer after many governors refused to cooperate and the group was unable to provide any evidence to back up that claim.\n\nPalm Beach and Broward counties have until Thursday at 3 p.m. to finish their recounts. County election officials expressed concern over the weekend that they wouldn\u2019t be able to run more than 8.2 million ballots through the machines in time, but supervisors from both Palm Beach and Broward County later said they were on track to get it done. It\u2019s not clear what might happen if the deadline is missed.\n\nAccording to Florida Secretary of State spokeswoman Sarah Revell, who said Florida state law doesn\u2019t grant her office the power to extend recount deadlines, if a county doesn\u2019t submit results by the deadline, the election results revert to the count from Election Day.\n\nAn automatic machine recount began Saturday in the Senate and gubernatorial races, as well as the statewide race for agriculture commissioner, because each was within the margin of 0.5 percent.\n\nIn the gubernatorial race, DeSantis leads Gillum by 0.41 percent, according to the Florida Division of Elections as of Monday morning.

The lawsuits on behalf Nelson aim to get more votes counted, and the lawsuits on behalf of Scott aim to ensure votes are being counted with accuracy.\n\nOn Monday, Nelson\u2019s campaign sued Secretary of State Ken Detzner, claiming that slow mail delivery delayed hundreds of thousands of mail-in ballots from being counted. According to Florida law, mail-in ballots must arrive by 7 p.m. on Election Day to be counted, but the lawsuit, on behalf of a veteran action fund and the two largest national Democratic committees, said over 870,000 ballots postmarked before Election Day hadn\u2019t been \u201ccounted as returned\u201d as of the Thursday after the election.\n\nLynne Sladky/AP, FILE\n\n\u201cVoters should not be disenfranchised solely due to the speed of the post office\u2019s delivery,\u201d the lawsuit said.\n\nNelson's campaign also recently sued over ballots thrown out for signature mismatches -- a law that requires election officials to check the signatures on mail-in and provisional ballots up against state records before accepting the vote.\n\nScott's campaign filed a lawsuit of their own over the weekend, in addition to the lawsuit filed by his campaign last week which a judge ruled on in his favor, forcing Broward's election supervisor to disclose the total number of votes cast in Broward County.\n\nBut the Scott campaign's request from over the weekend, which asked for law enforcement to impound ballots and counting equipment when not being used by Broward County to count and recount votes, was denied by a state judge Monday.\n\nSeventeenth Circuit Chief Judge Jack Tuter ruled that Scott\u2019s team lacked evidence of misconduct by election officials \u2014- which Scott\u2019s team had alleged in its lawsuit \u2014- to require law enforcement to step in.\n\nHe did order, however, that additional security be provided during the ongoing recount.

Nurul Huda said officials decided to shift the date to Dec. 30 in response to the proposals by the opposition parties. The new deadline for filing nominations is Nov. 28.\n\nThe ruling Awami League party, its allies and some opposition parties welcomed the decision, but a new major opposition alliance was unhappy because it wants the elections deferred by a month. The alliance, called the National Oikya Front, consists of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and other parties.\n\nThe National Oikya Front, led by prominent lawyer Kamal Hossain, could pose a major challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's desire to win a third consecutive term. Hossain was a close aide of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina's father, and now heads a small party, the Gono Forum.\n\nThe initial date for the election was announced last Thursday.\n\nHasina's five-year-term expires on Jan. 28.\n\nHuda said he was happy that all eligible political parties have agreed to join the elections. Initially it was unclear if Zia's party, which boycotted the last elections in 2014, would participate after she was jailed on corruption charges. But since it joined the new alliance, Zia's party has attempted to regain its position.\n\nOn Monday, five top opposition leaders met with Zia in a jail in Dhaka, and said she asked them to contest the polls.\n\n\"Madam offered prayers and expressed hope that we will move forward with our unity with the people,\" said Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, secretary-general of her party.\n\nHasina will head an election-time government as provided for in the constitution.

Following an appeal, the High Court extended her sentence to 10 years.\n\nIn a second case, a trial court last month sentenced Zia to seven years in jail on corruption charges linked to a charity fund named after her late husband.\n\nZia's party says both cases are politically motivated.\n\nZia faces more than 30 other cases pending in courts across the country.\n\nHer elder son, Tarique Rahman, the heir-apparent in a political culture of dynastic politics, has been in exile in London for years to avoid arrest.

Its leaders could contest with a different symbol under the new opposition alliance.\n\nThe court said Jamaat-e-Islami's registration violated election laws and the spirit of the constitution because the party had opposed the country's war of independence with Pakistan in 1971.

The overwhelming majority of people in Myanmar do not accept that the Rohingya are a native ethnic group, instead seeing them as illegal migrants from Bangladesh and calling them \"Bengalis.\"\n\nMyanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, attending a business conference Monday in Singapore on the sidelines of a Southeast Asian summit, did not mention the issue and did not take any questions.\n\nOn Sunday, officials in Myanmar announced that Bangladesh had said repatriations would begin on Thursday, with an initial group of 2,251 to be sent back from mid-November at a rate of 150 per day.\n\nSenior Myanmar officials said they would do their best to be ready, but Bangladesh's repatriation commissioner said he was unaware that a date had been set.\n\nThe UNHCR said it supports the \"voluntary and sustainable repatriation of Rohingya refugees in safety and in dignity to their places of origin or choice, and will work with all parties towards this goal.\" It is Myanmar's responsibility to improve conditions in the restive Rakhine region, it said.\n\nSunday's Myanmar government statement said the returning Rohingya would stay at repatriation camps for two days and receive food and clothing before moving on to transit camps. It said China, India and Japan were \"providing necessary assistance\" for the repatriation process, but did not give details.\n\nThe Rohingya exodus began after Myanmar security forces launched a brutal crackdown following coordinated insurgent attacks in August 2017.

The president's attempt to control the Justice Department -- up to and including Robert Mueller's investigation -- will run into concerns among some Republicans, with a push this week in the Senate to protect Mueller.\n\nThat effort is unlikely to succeed. But questions about acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker's legitimacy are growing, and House Democrats are making clear that what's happening now will come to public view later, if necessary.\n\nAndrew Harnik/AP, FILE\n\n\"We could subpoena Mueller, and ask him in front of the committee and ask him, 'What was in your final report?'\" Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., the next chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nOne other area where January would be too late: settling the handful of still-undecided races from last week's midterms. Trump has threatened federal intervention and even the possibility of a new round of voting in Arizona, while offering no evidence of the fraud he claims is rampant, almost daring other political leaders to engage.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks\n\nHere's a recap of the still-outstanding congressional and gubernatorial races -- those that ABC News still has not projected:\n\n-- Georgia governor's race, which could be headed to a runoff should the final vote or a potential recount show Secretary of State Brian Kemp failed to obtain the 50 percent required to declare victory.\n\n-- The Florida governor\u2019s race, which is currently in a recount.\n\n-- The Florida Senate race, which is also in a recount.\n\n-- The Arizona Senate race, which is razor thin, but still being counted.\n\nPlus nine House races: CA-10, CA-39, CA-45, CA-48, CA-49, ME-02, NJ-03, NM-02, UT-04.\n\nChuck Burton/AP, FILE\n\nThe slow returns, messy counts, confusing rules about signature matches and unsubstantiated claims of fraud by elected leaders are not helping maintain trust in the electoral system right now. One of the fundamentals of any democracy is free and fair elections, but that requires citizens' confidence in the process.\n\nThe races getting a lot of attention right now in Florida and Georgia are also putting a spotlight on the question of whether officials should be able to monitor their own elections.\n\nWhen it is hard to discern the candidate from the elected leader, it eats away at faith in the system.\n\nThe TIP with John Verhovek\n\n\"The evidence is that Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis have won.\"\n\nThe declaration from counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway on Sunday to ABC News' George Stephanopoulos may have projected confidence, but the truth of the matter is that we will not know who the next U.S. senator or governor of the state of Florida is until at least Nov. 15, the deadline to complete the automatic machine recount part of the process.\n\nJoe Skipper/Getty Images\n\nWhat Conway does have on her side is history. According to a 2016 analysis from FiveThirtyEight, the average election recount results in a swing of a little under 300 votes, far fewer than the 12,562 that currently separate Scott and Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson.\n\nBut as it so often has in so many close Florida elections, Broward County could hold the key to a Nelson or Gillum comeback.

Please check back Monday for the latest.", "For kids growing up in today's cashless society, the piggy bank is going virtual.\n\nFather of two Roland Hall turned to a British startup's digital pocket money app because his kids were still too young to get their own bank cards from traditional banks.\n\nWith prepaid debit cards linked to the app, Hall's kids, aged 8 and 10, can spend their allowance and chore money by shopping online or by tapping at contactless payment terminals in stores. Sounds like a recipe for splurging? Not so, he said.\n\n\"When kids have cash they want to spend it quickly. They want to go to the shops and spend it on rubbish,\" said Hall, an IT project manager. But an app lets them check their balances online, \"which actually makes them start thinking about saving rather than getting rid of the money,\" said Hall, who also prefers giving digital allowances because he never carries cash.\n\nThe app, which is called gohenry and expanded to the U.S. in April, is part of a wave of digital money apps combined with prepaid cards for kids as young as six that parents have access to. They are powerful new money management and savings tools that replace old-fashioned piggy banks and account passbooks. Some say they can help enhance financial literacy even as the growth of cashless payments upends traditional notions of money.\n\nGlobally, the number of non-cash transactions rose 11.2 percent to 433 billion in 2015 from the year before and are forecast to nearly double by 2020, according to the World Payments Report by financial services firms Capgemini and BNP Paribas. Britain, Canada and Sweden are among the world's most cashless countries, according to a 2017 ranking by currency website ForexBonuses, with widespread use of \"contactless\" bank cards that let shoppers merely tap on payment terminals for small transactions.\n\nIn China, where mobile payments rule, Alipay and WeChat Pay allow teens to hold accounts. Hong Kong offers a kids' version of its stored value Octopus card, based on older technology.\n\nIn the U.S., the fragmented banking sector means most cards still need to be swiped and, sometimes, require a pin number. Merchants in big U.S. cities are increasingly going cashless because they can gather more customer data, which makes it harder for teens without bank cards, said Stuart Sopp, CEO of Current, a two-year-old U.S. fintech startup.\n\n\"Parents are willing to pay to solve a problem that banks are not solving\" - helping youngsters deal with digital money, said Sopp.\n\nCurrent, gohenry and others such as Britain's Nimbl and Osper, Australia's Spriggy and Famzoo and Greenlight of the U.S. operate on similar principles. They typically charge a monthly or annual fee for prepaid debit cards. Parents can load money from their bank onto their own account, set weekly allowance amounts and spending limits, list chores to earn extra money, and block certain types of transactions, like online shopping.\n\nMoney is sent to kids' linked accounts, which they can use to set savings goals. The Current app rounds up each transaction and sweeps the change into a savings account.\n\nCrucially, the apps send instant alerts about transactions, a feature parents love, said gohenry CEO Alex Zivoder.\n\n\"You give cash to a kid, how do you as a parent know what he will do with this money?\" he said.\n\nHall said his son, Ralph, 8, uses it to save up to buy 70 pound ($92) soccer shoes and PlayStation video games while his daughter Lilly, 10, saves for shoes or clothing. They both also save up to buy extras on the video game Fortnite.\n\nHe said he turned to the app because \"I want them to understand what the value of money is.\"\n\nThe apps are making inroads amid growing adult uncertainty about how the shift to cashless payments is affecting children's view of money. In one U.K. survey commissioned last year by Prudential, about 78 percent of teachers and 37 percent of parents said it hurt youngsters' understanding of money.\n\nMore than a quarter felt contactless cards encouraged them to spend more and didn't help them develop mental arithmetic skills as well as handling cash, the poll of 501 parents found. No margin of error was given.\n\nThey're valid concerns, said Russell Winnard, head of programs and services at financial education charity Young Money, a charity, but he added that apps can help parents explain to children how money works.\n\n\"Young people are seeing less and less cash transactions, which just means that we have to be even more careful to talk about what is happening at each of those stages, because it has become more abstract,\" said Winnard.\n\nPaddy Kelly, another gohenry user, says he started using it because he was looking for a better way to help his 8-year-old daughter, Ailish, both save money and improve her math skills.\n\nShe had a piggy bank full of coins but her younger brother kept emptying it, Kelly said.\n\nHe likes the app's savings feature, which his daughter has used to set a goal of saving 20 pounds, at 2 pounds per week, with the aim of buying a pet gerbil. Getting her to figure out how long it would take to reach that goal is better than forcing her to do abstract math questions, which just makes her \"irate,\" he said.\n\n\"It gets her thinking about money in a slightly smarter way,\" said Kelly. \"Money is such an abstract concept, in today's world it kind of makes sense\" for kids to use digital pocket money apps, he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Kelvin Chan on Twitter at www.twitter.com/chanman", "The Latest on the announcement that Germany's top security official will stay on as interior minister, but give up party post (all times local):\n\n11:50 a.m.\n\nGermany's top security official Horst Seehofer says he's stepping down as head of his party but will remain interior minister in Chancellor Angela Merkel's Cabinet.\n\nSeehofer had been reportedly planning on resigning both posts but told reporters that \"I am the federal interior minister and will continue to serve in that role.\"\n\nSeehofer did confirm that he was planning on resigning as head of the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian-only sister party of Merkel's Christian Democrats.

Mugabe, then 93, soon resigned, ending his 37-year rule.\n\nA year later Zimbabwe's economic problems have worsened and restrictions on basic freedoms remain, bringing some Zimbabweans to ask 'What has changed?' and 'Are things better?'\n\nThe euphoria at Mugabe's fall has evaporated. Mnangagwa promised Zimbabwe \"a new dawn\" but to many the country looks depressingly familiar with long lines at the banks to withdraw paltry amounts of cash and shortages of basic goods have led to the rationing of cooking oil, bottled water and beer.\n\n\"They played us, we marched for nothing,\" Adrea Magoronye, a Harare resident said as she stood in a line for cooking oil at a supermarket.\n\nMnangagwa started well but his disputed election victory in July, followed by the military opening fire and shooting dead six civilians, a cholera outbreak and an economic implosion have cast a pall over the 76-year-old's first year in power.\n\nMnangagwa promised to turn the collapsed economy into a middle-class one by 2030, underpinned by democratic reform and reengagement with the U.S. and other Western countries that placed sanctions during Mugabe's time.\n\nThose sanctions have not yet been lifted and the signs are not reassuring. In September, inflation climbed to its highest since 2010, according to Zimstat, the national statistics agency.\n\nDrugs are in short supply in a country where the health system has long been on the brink of collapse.

We urge the government to increase the allocation of forex (foreign exchange) as the gap is currently huge as a matter of urgency,\" said the Zimbabwe Medical Association in a statement last week.\n\nZimbabwe is recovering from an outbreak of cholera, a disease described by the president as \"medieval,\" that killed at least 50 people in the capital, Harare.\n\nMany fear the current crisis, induced by foreign currency shortages and a ballooning debt, could spiral into the kind of economic collapse seen a decade ago when Zimbabwe's hyperinflation reached 500 billion percent, according to the International Monetary Fund, and cholera killed more than 4,000 people.\n\nPlastic bags of 100-trillion Zimbabwe dollar banknotes were not enough to buy basic groceries. People fear a return to that hyperinflation.\n\nThe new currency shortage has forced the government to rely on the printing of bond notes, which are rapidly losing value. The government has also been paying civil servants through electronic funds that show up in bank accounts but cannot be turned into cash. There is also a system of mobile money. All of which are devaluing quickly against the U.S. dollar on the black market.\n\n\"The government hasn't moved in the new direction any distance yet,\" said Harare based economic consultant John Robertson.\n\n\"There is no improvement in liquidity, no improvement in foreign reserves either borrowed or earned and no improvement in investment inflows so it is becoming increasingly disappointing. People's patience has worn really thin,\" said Robertson.\n\nMnangagwa's government asserts that some things have improved.\n\n\"A lot has changed. It has been a very active period for us. We hope to achieve the best for Zimbabweans in the nearest future,\" deputy information minister Energy Mutodi told The Associated Press.\n\nMutodi admitted that \"the economy is our biggest challenge\" but pointed to more freedoms as a sign of a new direction.\n\n\"Freedom of expression, freedom of speech, freedom of association; things that were taboo in the past are now being entrenched and fortified in this era,\" said Mutodi. Police roadblocks, where motorists were routinely hassled for bribes, have been eradicated, for instance.\n\nCritics say Mnangagwa's government remains repressive, citing arrests of people accused of criticizing the president, a characteristic of Mugabe's regime. They also point to the killing of six people when the military fired into protesters on Aug. 2 and the banning of anti-government demonstrations.\n\n\"We are moving back to the pre-coup era,\" said Lizwe Jamela, a human rights lawyer in Harare. \"People are still being arrested for expressing themselves, people are being arrested for dissent and for organizing peaceful demonstrations,\" he said.\n\nHe cited the case of a prison guard who was fired on Nov.5 for \"traitorous\" behavior after he allegedly posted a pro-opposition tweet as well as the arrest of trade unionists and other activists in recent months.\n\n\"That trend would indicate that we are not yet Uhuru,\" said Jamela, using the popular Swahili word for freedom. \"We have a long road ahead.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story was corrected to show that Mugabe was 93 when he resigned in Nov. 2017.", "Your daily look at late-breaking news, upcoming events and the stories that will be talked about today:\n\n1.

He emphasized that the continuing fighting in Afghanistan threatens the interests of Russia and its allies in Central Asia.\n\n\"Afghanistan is close to our underbelly so national interests of Russia and its allies are at stake,\" Kobulov said at a briefing. \"We can't just sit back and watch impassively what's going on, and we have let the U.S. know that it doesn't appear to be successful in settlement efforts.\"\n\nKabulov charged that \"the presence of the U.S. and NATO hasn't only failed to solve the problem but exacerbated it,\" noting that the Taliban has steadily expanded its foothold.\n\n\"The West has lost the war in Afghanistan, and it's reluctant to acknowledge that obvious fact,\" Kabulov said. \"If they continue to rely on force, it would only lead to thousands more victims and further ravage the country.\"\n\nHe noted that regional powers, including Russia, China, Pakistan and Iran have a strong interest in ending the conflict and should play a more active role.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy sent a diplomat to observe Friday's conference in Moscow that was attended by several members of Afghanistan's government-appointed Peace Council and the Taliban.

The group reaffirmed that position in Moscow, saying it would talk directly to the U.S. to demand its pullout from the country.\n\nKabulov said that he may meet with the U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, later this fall.", "It's Monday, Nov. 12, 2018.

The casualties were taken to hospitals, he added.\n\nIn a statement posted on its media arm, the Aamaq news agency, IS said it targeted a gathering of Shiites. Both the Taliban, who now control nearly half of Afghanistan and stage near-daily attacks on Afghan forces, and the Islamic State group's affiliate in the region have been behind many recent Kabul attacks and bombings.\n\nMeanwhile, Afghan lawmaker Ali Akbar Qasemi said the fighting in Ghazni since Sunday has focused on the district of Jaghuri where 20 policemen have been killed.\n\nThe Afghan army chief, Gen. Mohammad Sharif Yaftali, told reporters that government forces have sustained casualties but declined to elaborate on specifics or say how many were killed.\n\nTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid took responsibility for the Jaghuri attacks and claimed in a text message to the media that the Taliban have also captured Ghazni's district of Malistan.\n\nThere was no immediate response from authorities on Malistan.\n\nGhazni is the only one out of 34 Afghan provinces where the country's October parliamentary elections could not take place for security reasons. Voting there has been postponed for a year.\n\nIn August, the Taliban overran parts of the provincial capital, also called Ghazni. At the time, hundreds of people fled the city amid intense fighting between Afghan forces and insurgents that killed about 120 members of the security forces and civilians. According to Afghan authorities, nearly 200 insurgents, many of them foreign fighters, were also killed.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Maamoun Youssef in Cairo contributed to this story.", "Representatives of Libya's quarrelling factions and of countries keen on stabilizing the North African nation started meetings in Sicily on Monday, as Italy encourages a political settlement that could bolster the fight against Islamic militants and stop illegal migrants from crossing the Mediterranean to Europe's southern shores.\n\nItaly's anti-migrant populist government organized the two-day conference in Palermo with an eye to making progress on a long-elusive goal of ending years of lawlessness in Libya. Rival Libyan administrations jockey for power, militias clash in often deadly bids to boost prestige and influence, and human traffickers exploit the chaos to pursue their lucrative business from their base in the North African country.\n\nArriving a few hours before a closed working dinner to begin the conference, Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte told reporters the conference aims to \"help end the armed conflicts and to help the Libyan stabilization process\" in the framework of the United Nations.\n\nEventually, the West hopes Libyans will have a democratic election, but the conference isn't aiming to fix a date. \"We want the Libyan people to be able to democratically decide their own future,\" Conte said.\n\nThere was skepticism on how much progress might be made toward stability at the conference in a luxury seaside hotel in large part because it wasn't clear if a key player, Gen. Khalifa Hifter, commander of the self-styled Libyan National Army with a power base in eastern Libya, would meet with his Libyan rivals in plenary sessions set for Tuesday.\n\nConte warmly shook hands with Hifter as he greeted guests arriving for the dinner session.\n\nLibya plunged into chaos after the 2011 uprising that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, and it is now governed by rival administrations in the east and west with both relying on the support of militias.\n\nIt has also become a haven for Islamic militants and armed groups, including several from neighboring countries, which survive on looting and human trafficking, particularly in the remote south of the country.\n\nConte met on Monday with Ghassan Salame, the U.N. special envoy to Libya, who last week told the U.N. Security Council that the \"status quo in Libya was untenable\" with the country.\n\nOne of Salame's other meetings on conference sidelines saw him exchange views on political developments with Fayez Serraj, the prime minister of the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli and a chief rival of Hifter.\n\nItaly has been a staunch Serraj backer.\n\nLibya's neighbor to the east, Egypt, backs Hifter. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, among the participants, had recently reiterated Cairo's call for lifting the international arms embargo against Libya.\n\nIn an interview published Monday in Italian daily La Stampa, Conte portrayed the gathering as an opportunity to \"sustain the creation and deployment of regular armed forces and security forces.\"\n\nFor rights advocates, the conference posed another kind of opportunity: To draw attention to the plight of migrants trapped in Libya, now that the nearly nightly launching of human traffickers' boats from Libya's coasts has sharply dropped off as Italy and Malta have closed their ports to private rescue groups' vessels.\n\n\"Amnesty International is calling on all those taking part in the conference to ensure that human rights of all people in the country, including refugees and migrants, are placed at the center of their negotiations,\" the rights group said in a statement.\n\nIt decried that Libya has \"repeatedly delayed\" the opening of a long-promised processing center for the U.N. refugees organization, to relocate refugees from \"abusive detention centers.\"\n\nWith Libya's rich oil and gas resources, energy-rivals Italy and France have been jockeying for influence.\n\nFrance hosted a meeting on Libya in May, when rival Libyan leaders tentatively agreed on a roadmap for parliamentary and presidential elections but declined to sign a declaration outlining their commitments.\n\nConte's six-month-old government \u2014 and especially anti-migrant Interior Minister Matteo Salvini \u2014 sees a more stable and secure Libya as the best outcome for Italians, and for the right-wing voter base in particular.\n\nHifter has been instrumental in the fight against militants, going after them in their eastern hideouts and occasionally foraying into the vast and largely lawless south. However, a deadly overnight attack last month by militants from the extremist Islamic State group showed the limitations of his army.\n\nMeanwhile, encounters on the conference's sidelines focused on encouraging Libyan economic reforms.\n\nStephanie Williams, a deputy to Salame, the U.N. special representative, official, said in a tweet that there was a \"positive tendency\" in the economic sphere. She noted that bank reserves' liquidity had increased and thus there was a decline in black market exchange activity.\n\n\"Dealing with the economic dimension of the Libya crisis will help prepare the grounds for a future political settlement,\" Claudia Gazzini, a former political adviser to Salame and currently a consulting analyst on Libya with the International Crisis Group, commented in a tweet.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFrances D'Emilio in Rome, and Rami Musa in Benghazi, Libya, contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nA previous version of this story was corrected to eastern instead of western Libyan in Hifter reference.", "Japanese technology company SoftBank Group Corp. will carry out an initial public offering of its Japanese mobile subsidiary, set for Dec. 19, in what will likely be one of the world's biggest IPOs.\n\nThe Tokyo Stock Exchange approved the listing of 1.6 billion shares of SoftBank Corp.

Son has said denounced the killing. He said earlier this month that he went to Saudi Arabia to relay his concerns to the prince.\n\nSon has been partnering with Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and about half of his $100 billion Vision Fund, established in 2016, comes from the kingdom. The fund has been investing in various companies, solar projects and artificial intelligence.\n\nKhashoggi, a 59-year-old columnist for The Washington Post, was killed at the Saudi Consulate in Turkey on Oct. 2, although details are still unclear.\n\nSoftBank is eager to gain cash to fuel its investments, which include financial-technology, ride-booking services, as well as office space sharing WeWork and the Pepper companion robot.\n\nEven after the listing, the parent owns 63 percent of Softbank Group.\n\nSoftBank's IPO, which may be expanded to include more shares to as many as 1.7 billion shares, could be the biggest ever.

Earlier this year, the Ministry of Youth and Sports earmarked 4 million hryvnias (about $150,000) to fund some of the youth camps among the dozens built by the nationalists. The purpose, according to the ministry, is \"national patriotic education.\"\n\nMinistry spokeswoman Natalia Vernigora said the money is distributed by a panel which looks for \"signs of xenophobia and discrimination, it doesn't analyze activities of specific groups.\"\n\nFelipe Dana/AP\n\nCherkashin is a veteran of the fight against pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine; he was wounded in combat and later came to lead Sokil, or Falcon, the youth wing of the Svoboda party. It is important, he says, to inculcate the nation's youth with nationalist thought, so they can battle Vladimir Putin's Russia as well as \"challenges that could completely destroy\" European civilization.\n\nAmong those challenges: LGBT rights, which lecturers denounce as a sign of Western decadence.\n\n\"You need to be aware of all that,\" said instructor Ruslan Andreiko. \"All those gender things, all those perversions of modern Bolsheviks who have come to power in Europe and now try to make all those LGBT things like gay pride parades part of the education system.\"\n\nFelipe Dana/AP\n\nWhile some youths dozed off during lectures, others paid attention. Clearly, some were receptive.\n\nDuring a break in training, a teenager played a nationalist march on his guitar. It was decorated with a sticker showing white bombs hitting a mosque, under the motto, \"White Europe is Our Goal.\"\n\nAside from the lectures \u2014 and songs around the campfire \u2014 life for the several dozen youths at the Svoboda camp was hard.\n\nCampers were awakened in the middle of the night with a blast from a stun grenade.

May faces increasing domestic pressure over her proposals for an agreement following the resignation of another government minister last week.\n\nNo Brexit breakthrough was announced Monday after talks between European affairs ministers, but the two sides are locked in technical negotiations to try to bridge the final gaps in a move laden with heavy political and economic consequences.\n\n\"Clearly this is a very important week for Brexit negotiations,\" Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told reporters after the meeting in Brussels. \"The two negotiating teams have really intensified their engagement ... There is still clearly work to do.\"\n\nThe main obstacle to an agreement is how to keep goods flowing smoothly across the border between EU country Ireland and Northern Ireland in the U.K.\n\nBoth sides have committed to avoid a \"hard border\" with costly and time-consuming checks that would hamper business. Any new customs posts on the border could also re-ignite lingering sectarian tensions.\n\nMay's spokesman said talks between U.K. and EU negotiators ran until the early hours of Monday morning and would resume Tuesday. James Slack said there had been \"good progress\" but there were \"substantial issues still to overcome\" on the issue of the Irish border. Still, he said Britain is sticking to its ambition of finalizing a Brexit deal \"in the autumn.\"\n\nAnd Martin Callanan, Britain's Minister of State at the Department for Exiting the European Union said everybody is \"straining every sinew to make sure that we get a deal but we have to get a deal that is right for the U.K., right for the EU and one that would be acceptable to the U.K. parliament.\"\n\nEU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier did not speak to reporters Monday and a planned news conference with him was cancelled.\n\nInstead, EU headquarters issued a short statement saying that Barnier explained to the ministers that \"intense negotiating efforts continue, but an agreement has not been reached yet.\"\n\nEarlier, France's EU affairs minister, Nathalie Loiseau, stepped up pressure on May. \"The ball is in the British court. It is a question of a British political decision,\" she said.\n\nBelgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders agreed, saying that the EU is \"waiting for new news from London.\"\n\n\"We have time but not so much,\" he added.\n\nThe EU is awaiting Barnier's signal as to whether sufficient progress has been made to call an EU summit to seal a deal. Rumors have swirled of a possible top-level meeting at the end of November.\n\nSigns have emerged in recent days that some progress is being made behind the scenes, but all parties have remained tight-lipped about the developments, given the politically charged atmosphere.\n\nAustrian EU affairs minister, Gernot Bluemel \u2014 whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency until the end of the year \u2014 said \"there is a certain dynamic in the negotiations, but it is too early to say how we are going to proceed on that.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Finnish Prime Minister Juha Sipila said that major progress was likely \"within a week,\" based on his Brexit discussions with several EU leaders who visited Helsinki.\n\n\"We're going through crucial days now. We're very close now,\" Sipila said.\n\nIn Britain, pro-Brexit and pro-EU politicians alike are warning May that the deal she seeks is likely to be shot down by Parliament.\n\nBoris Johnson, a staunch Brexit supporter, wrote in a column for Monday's Daily Telegraph that May's plan to adhere closely to EU regulations in return for a trade deal and an open Irish border amounts to \"total surrender\" to the bloc.\n\nThe proposed terms are scarcely more popular with advocates of continued EU membership.\n\nFormer Education Secretary Justine Greening on Monday called May's proposals the \"worst of all worlds,\" and said the public should be allowed to vote on Britain's departure again.\n\n\"We should be planning as to how we can put this final say on Brexit in the hands of the British people,\" Greening told the BBC.\n\nJohnson's younger brother, Jo Johnson, resigned last week backing calls for a second referendum on whether the country should leave the EU. May has consistently rejected the idea of another nationwide vote on Brexit.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nLawless reported from London.", "To say the Jets , Raiders and Bucs have quit would be hyperbole.\n\nTo say their fans are ready to quit watching them would be more accurate.\n\nThere was little to nothing worth mentioning about their performances Sunday in one-sided defeats. In the New York and Tampa Bay areas, much of the chatter will be about removing Todd Bowles and Dirk Koetter as head coaches of their respective outfits. At least Jon Gruden won't be worrying about job security with a Raiders team he has torn asunder, and he has the job security to rebuild.\n\nBowles got it right at the New Jersey Meadowlands by saying following a 41-10 embarrassment at the hands of the previously-inept-on-offense Buffalo: \"We stunk it up as coaches, we stunk it up as players.\"\n\nHis team certainly represented what used to be swamp land quite well Sunday.\n\nThe Jets (3-7, losers of four in a row) were blitzed from the beginning by a quarterback, Matt Barkley, who was unemployed a few days ago, and has been a journeyman for almost his entire NFL stint; this was his 12th game since 2013. They were overrun by LeSean McCoy, which is fine except when you consider he was in a horrendous slump and hadn't scored all season.\n\nWorst, they seemed apathetic and disinterested from the start, a strong indictment of the players and the coaches.\n\n\"They just came in and just straight, flat out, beat us,\" said Jets receiver Jermaine Kearse, who has had to adjust to lots of losing in New York after lots of winning while he was with the Seahawks. \"I wish I could give you an explanation. It's frustrating for all of us, but they just came in here and straight beat us.\"\n\nMaybe because the Bills were trying a whole lot harder?\n\n\"Nobody's quit on anybody,\" Kearse added. \"We win together, we lose together and that's everybody's mindset right now. We're all not perfect, we're out here trying to figure it out and find ways to improve this situation like anybody else. So, I would think that's far from the truth.\"\n\nThe Jets have never fired a coach during the season since the Johnson family bought the franchise in 2000. At least Bowles seems to have that going for him.\n\nKoetter is in his third season in charge in Tampa, and he's supposedly an offensive mastermind. Until being manhandled by Washington, the Bucs were tearing it up when they had the ball. Maybe somebody tore up all the play sheets that worked previously because they scored a mere three points against a team struggling with injuries.\n\nOffensive coordinator Todd Monken had been calling plays, but Koetter took over against the Redskins. He wouldn't explain why, but clearly it was a bogus decision.\n\n\"We weren't good enough as a team, and that starts with me,\" Koetter said. \"To move the ball like that and come up with three points, you're just not going to win that way.\"\n\nTampa (3-6) has the second-longest playoff drought, 10 seasons, and Koetter's chances of breaking that string are diminishing rapidly.\n\nNo such worries for Gruden, whose return to Oakland has been a fiasco so far. Give him credit for all the high draft picks the Raiders will have in April, and maybe for the high prospects they will carry into Las Vegas when they move in 2020.\n\nFor now, though, well \u2014 pardon us on this one \u2014 they've fallen into a Black Hole.\n\n\"This will be a year that a lot of us will never forget,\" Gruden said of his 1-8 team that has been outscored 75-9 in the past nine quarters in what has quickly become a lost season. \"It's painful. It's really hard. It's painful. It's going to be hard to sleep again, hard to get up in the morning.\"\n\nWhen Gruden gets up, he'll perhaps look at others to get rid of as he retools the roster already missing Khalil Mack, Bruce Irvin and Amari Cooper. He's got that wildly lucrative 10-year contract, virtual total control of personnel and no qualms about doing pretty much anything.\n\nWhat must hurt fans of these three teams that got hammered Sunday is that the effort from other losing clubs \u2014 Arizona, which tested powerful Kansas City; Cleveland, which stunned Atlanta; and, of course, Buffalo \u2014 was so strong, so admirable. Perhaps the worst sign for a struggling team is when it looks lost, lethargic and lacking skill on the field.\n\nIn New Jersey and the Tampa and Oakland bay areas, that's exactly what the fans saw in Week 10.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP\u2014NFL", "OPEC and allied oil-producing countries will likely need to cut crude supplies, perhaps by as much as 1 million barrels of oil a day, to rebalance the market after U.S. sanctions on Iran failed to cut Tehran's output, Saudi Arabia's energy minister said Monday.\n\nThe comments from the minister, Khalid al-Falih, show the balancing act the U.S. allies face in dealing with President Donald Trump's actions related to the oil industry.\n\nTrump in recent weeks demanded the oil cartel increase production to drive down U.S. gasoline prices. \"Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!\" he tweeted Monday.\n\nThe U.S. has meanwhile allowed some of its allies \u2014 Greece, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey \u2014 as well as rival China to continue to purchase Iranian oil despite re-imposed sanctions, as long as they work to reduce their imports to zero.\n\nAl-Falih, who on Sunday said the kingdom would cut production by over 500,000 barrels per day in December, said Monday that Saudi Arabia had been giving customers \"100 percent of what they asked for.\" That appeared to be a veiled reference to Trump.\n\nBefore the United States re-imposed sanctions on Iran, \"fear and anxiety gripped the market,\" al-Falih said at the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition & Conference. Now \"we're seeing the pendulum swing violently to the other side,\" he added.\n\nThe energy minister of the United Arab Emirates, Suhail al-Mazrouei, currently the president of OPEC, said \"changes\" likely would be necessary as the oil cartel meets in December in Vienna. However, he added: \"We need not to overreact when these things happen.\"\n\nAl-Falih said OPEC officials have seen analysis papers suggesting a production cut of upward of 1 million barrels of crude a day may be necessary to rebalance the market. However, he stressed that more study needed to be done.\n\n\"There are a lot of assumptions in their projections that may change,\" al-Falih said. \"We don't want to throttle the global economy.\"\n\nA gallon of regular gasoline in the U.S. on average now sells for $2.69, down from $2.90 a month ago, according to AAA. Those lower prices likely quieted Trump, but production cuts could again boost prices at the pump.\n\nNeither al-Falih nor al-Mazrouei directly criticized Trump, but Mohammed Hamad al-Rumhy, Oman's oil and gas minister, blamed the U.S. president for some of the volatility striking the oil market. Oman, a sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, maintains close diplomatic ties to Iran and often serves as an interlocutor between Western powers and Tehran.\n\n\"Supply and demand is perhaps the easy part because you can measure it,\" al-Rumhy said. It's \"extremely difficult to quantify what is happening in (the) White House \u2014 almost impossible.\"\n\nIran, which has tense relations with Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE, did not have a high-level official at the summit.\n\nCrude oil dropped to a low of $30 a barrel in January 2016. That forced OPEC to partner with non-OPEC countries, including Russia, to cut production to help prices rebound.\n\nBenchmark Brent crude, which had been trading above $80 a barrel recently, now hovers just over $70 after the U.S. sanction waivers on Iran.\n\nMeanwhile, Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber, the head of the state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., said the UAE planned to increase oil production to 4 million barrels a day by 2020 and 5 million barrels a day by 2030. The UAE now produces some 3 million barrels of oil a day.\n\nAl-Jaber also said the UAE would begin fracking \u2014 injecting high-pressure mixtures of water, sand or gravel and chemicals \u2014 to gain access to otherwise unreachable natural gas reserves.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Hydrocarbons will continue to play an absolutely essential part of a diversified energy mix,\" al-Jaber said.\n\nBut the highs and lows of the market need to end for both oil consumers and producers to profit, said al-Rumhy, the Omani official.\n\n\"If it was my heart beat going that way, I think I would be in the hospital right now,\" he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap .", "The Turkish coast guard on Monday recovered four bodies and was still searching for six missing migrants after their boat sank in the Aegean Sea, Turkey's state-run news agency reported.\n\nAnadolu Agency said three other migrants were rescued as part of a search-and-rescue operation launched after the boat, with a total of 15 people on board, went down off the coast of Dikili, close to the Greek island of Lesbos. Earlier, two of the migrants managed to swim to shore to seek help.\n\nThe group was made up of 14 Afghans and one was an Iraqi citizen, the agency reported. Four of them were children.\n\nFishing boats were helping a coast guard helicopter and three coast guard boats in the search for the missing, Anadolu said.\n\nAlthough their numbers have decreased in recent years, migrants still try to cross into Greece from nearby Turkey in the hopes of making their way to other European countries.", "Singapore's leader vowed Monday to strengthen ties with Malaysia, which is now led by a historic rival following a game-changing election.\n\nSingapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said during a visit by his Malaysian counterpart, Mahathir Mohamad, that the countries had a \"special bond\" and were each other's second-biggest trading partners. Singapore is also Malaysia's second-largest foreign investor.\n\n\"Singapore and Malaysia will always have a good place for each other in our hearts, and because of our proximity and interdependence, we will always have an interest in each other's development and success,\" Lee said, adding that he looked forward to working with Mahathir.\n\nMahathir led Malaysia for 22 years before stepping down in 2003. During his term there were frequent sharp exchanges with neighboring Singapore and Lee's father, its first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew.\n\nIn May, an electoral upset that toppled former Prime Minister Najib Razak brought Mahathir into power again. Mahathir had put aside a dispute with a former political nemesis to lead a four-party coalition to victory.\n\nThe 93-year-old plans to lead the country for at least two years before handing the reins to his former nemesis, Anwar Ibrahim.\n\nMahathir is on his first official visit to Singapore since winning the election. He said he hopes the two countries will maintain good relations, even with different administrations in power.\n\n\"Singapore and Malaysia are mutually dependent. Singapore has got no hinterland, but it must regard Malaysia as its hinterland. On the other hand, for a very long time, Malaysia had to depend on Singapore for its exports and imports,\" Mahathir said.\n\nNeither leader addressed bumps in projects since Mahathir has taken office. He has put the brakes on the construction of a high-speed rail connecting the country's capital, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore.\n\nMahathir is also renegotiating a decades-old water treaty, and plans to raise the price of water sold to Singapore by more than 10 times.\n\nOn Monday, Mahathir expressed hope that the countries will be able to work together despite having a rivalry.\n\n\"Malaysia and Singapore are twins, in a way. Except that perhaps the elder twin is a little bit bigger than the younger twin and a little bit older,\" he quipped, to laughter.\n\n\"It is not often that we see countries which come together, and then separated and still be able to ... work together and help each other,\" Mahathir added.\n\nThe two countries were briefly merged in 1963, but they separated two years later due to political and economic differences.", "Transcript for Carrie Underwood's triumph through heartbreak to success she never imagined: Part 3\n\n?????? Bring back memories being here on the football field? Yes, I was a cheerleader up until my freshman year of high school. Long before Carrie Underwood became the queen of country, \"In the spotlight\" has been right there with her, heading back to her hometown of checotah, Oklahoma just four years after she was crowned American idol. Thank you! In 2009, the girl who once dreamed of being a journalist was a newly crowned queen of country with mega-crossover hits like \"Jesus take the wheel.\" ??? Jesus take the wheel. Reporter: And \"Before he cheats\". ??? Maybe next time -- How has it changed? The town? Yeah, since, in the recent years. Um, there are things that are different. We got another stoplight, we got a new Walmart, we got a new stoplight because of the new Walmart. It was the talk of the town for robin Roberts and me to be like, walking around in my tiny hometown of checotah, Oklahoma. Carrie recently reminisced about sharing her story on this broadcast including ten years ago at this checotah bowling alley. The girl with the golden touch, took one step up to the lane, and -- Nice. That's it. I don't know if I can talk to you now. It's one of the highlights of my career and now I know I can, you know, always go back to my professional bowling if I need to if this doesn't work out for me. Back then, Carrie opened up about her plans for the future. Do you have a timeline with your thinking about marriage and kids? Oh, gosh. As far as the timeline now, I mean it really just depends on what god has planned. You know, it's not -- I can try to make my own plans. I've been doing that my whole life, and it's never worked out so I don't know why I'd start now. But she did make plans. A year later she was married to Canadian hockey star Mike fisher, but it was a short honeymoon. As soon as we got back, he went back to Canada, so it was like, \"See Ya, husband.\" It was very strange. I really don't feel like I've lived a married life yet. It's great whatever it is, whatever this is. They were both hitting the road. Him with his team, her on her new tour. ??? Do it ??? And guess who was right there with her? This is the all access we've been promising people. Carrie gave us an exclusive look at her 109-city \"Play on\" tour, backstage, under the stage, and on stage! You wanna go up? Yeah! ?????? So this is how you sit. Yeah, I'm kind of like -- got my little Mike thingy. ??? He's like a curse he's like a drug ??? Now, that's an entrance. And just months after marriage, the number one question our fans wanted asked, so if you come back in a year, are you going to have news? I don't know. I'm going to say no. I know I've read all kinds of things like that already. I said, I'm going to be devastated when I read my first like magazine like 'baby bump, you know pointing right there. Uh, but no. We just want to be together and keep it as simple as possible, and I think a baby would just make things so complicated. They did take their time, and five years later -- We're pregnant. Carrie used her longstanding cma award co-host for the big reveal. Will you please just tell me what you're having? I'll keep it a secret. You won't tell anybody. Nobody! Hey, we could name him Garth! What are you doing? Oh, damn it! What is wrong with you! Carrie now had two men in her life, Mike and Isaiah. ??? And now I'm holding what I never knew I always wanted ??? And I feel that these two really inspired that track. Yeah, they did. Tell us about it. It's called \"What I never knew I always wanted\" and that kind of sums it up. Both, both of them. The men in my life. Now I couldn't imagine my life without either one of them. ??? With your love ??? And that year, Carrie honored dolly parton, singing on the show, the classic country hit, \"9 to 5.\" ??? Working 9 to 5 what a way to make a living ??? ??? barely getting by it's all taking and no giving ??? ??? they just use your mind ??? Obviously I love dolly parton, and I feel like there's so many women that have, you know, set up those pillars for the rest of us to be able to continue to take -- take their incredible legacies and do the best we can to build on them. ?????? And Carrie is still building her own legacy, getting her own star on the Hollywood walk of fame just last month. I've been so blessed in my life to have so many people who have -- crap. I'm crying! The last year hasn't been without difficulties, though. A year ago she shared with fans on Instagram that she was sent to the hospital after a bad fall and had to get over 40 stitches on her face. And recently she revealed she suffered three miscarriages. But now the news is good. She's expecting her second child. Carrie Underwood. Recently she was named CMT's artist of the year. Thank you. And is getting ready for a tour promoting her sixth studio album, \"Cry pretty.\" ?????? For Ken years we've seen that Carrie Underwood has a lot to cry about. Tears of sorrow, tears of joy, tears of gratitude. If you had told me, growing up, that I'd be doing this, and I'd be playing a stadium in Nashville someday, and I'd be a member of the grand ole opry. And I'd be married to some cute hockey guy. There's no way I could have believed that that would ever happen.

We took a no-limits look at life with the Bryan family, extended farm animal family included. Woah, boss! Boss, no, no, no, no, no, no! Hey, Bo. Bo-bo! Oh, goodness! Live Oh, no. Boss! Is he ok? He's okay. He does this about once a week. This poor chicken! God. This poor chicken. Only for you, robin, I'll ride on my pretty green grass.

I can truly say that there is no act but I love that about him, because I know it's not -- he doesn't have to be in his artist mood or go into some persona. No, it's the same.

Let y'all in on some of the secrets.\" Reporter: Last year on our cma special, he invited us along for the ride. So right here is my tour bus, my home away from home. Right here is catering. You wouldn't think that it would be such an undertaking, but when you're feeding 200 plus people three meals a day. Another very important aspect, the porta-potty.

This piano was in our first house, and I had been working on a particular song, and it was \"Do I.\" ??? Baby what are we becoming it feels like we were always running ??? that was it! You know, the most important thing for me when we did the special last year was inspiring people that have had tough things in their life. I was set to move to Nashville when I was 19. And I had it all in line and had an apartment. Just before I moved to Nashville, my brother was killed in a car accident. Reporter: Ten years later, tragedy visited the Bryan family again. In April 2007, Luke was on the verge of career changing success, playing the grand ole opry for the first time. He took this last photo with his sister, Kelley, that night. She passed a month later. That's been one thing about my family and our loss. Just when we started picking up the pieces with my brother, then my sister. We lose my sister, and I just watched my mother and our whole family just go back to square one. And I know a lot of people out there that have dealt with loss, you have to honor their memory by living, and you have to -- you have to be a positive light for people. But you've had your tough days, and though they haven't always been -- Oh, you do. I mean, there's so many aspects of -- Yeah. I mean, when I'm out, you know, when I'm playing with my boys, and I'm like, god, why isn't my sister here to be -- and why isn't my brother. Do you notice, we're talking about your brother and sister, and for the first time since we came out -- The dadgum sun came out. You know what? When we have somebody that comes up to me and our family and says, \"Because of that special, we feel like that we can keep fighting.\" If we just helped one person, feel like they still have purpose and can keep going, then I truly feel that that special did that. And just how beautiful the whole thing was, um, was very inspiring for me and my family, and I still to this day, I mean, somebody can walk up to me and go, \"You know, we saw your story, and, um, it really meant a lot to us.\" And that's what it was about so I'm really proud of that.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Transcript for Country stars on dealing with hardships, divorce and tragedy: Part 2\n\nbiggest stars are making headlines that have nothing to do with their music.

Man I feel like a woman ??? Reporter: In 2013, Shania twain was headlining a new show in Las Vegas. ??? I feel like a woman ??? This is the larger than life Shania. Reporter: These are big! Cause I'm kinda tall! She shared with me the trauma of growing up with what she says was an abusive stepfather. He had a problem.

Have you forgiven him? I don't -- I'm not -- oh, forgiving? I'm still mad, you know. I'll probably be mad forever.

Reporter: In 2010, she was now 28, and she invited me into her home to set the record straight about a story that was making tabloid headlines. Was there one tabloid story that you picked up and you're like -- One? I think the biggest one, the first one that started out was the fact that I was a stalker. I was like \"Really?\" The fact that anyone would print that actually without talking to my side was shocking. Do you want to have sex? Excuse me? Reporter: While acting in the film \"Northern lights\" -- I find you cute. You find me hot. Reporter: There were reports she had an affair with her co-star, Eddie Cibrian, while both she and Cibrian were married. You had two couples whose marriages didn't work who really stumbled upon each other and fell in love and never ever was I thinking of hurting someone. Reporter: For the first time, both she and Eddie sat down together for an interview. We're madly in love. Reporter: And showed me their new life as a couple. Two years later, Leann was now married to Eddie. And she returned to \"In the spotlight\" to explain her recent visit to rehab and how it stemmed from her incredible success too early.

Reporter: Months later the duo who had been together for over two decades shocked their fans and announced they were taking a break from \"Sugarland.\" Some speculated it was a permanent breakup. It's fascinating, people's connection to drama and scandal and wanting to say that it was a breakup. You know, it was never that. We wanted to go fill our cups with new things, you know? Reporter: And their cups were both quite full. Within months of the tragedy, Jennifer got married and was soon expecting a son. At the same time, Kristian was going through a divorce from his wife of 12 years. Layered challenge is a thing that hurts no matter how you do it. Well, and it's also layered challenge because, in talking about what we do, people are interested in it. See, people have babies and get divorced every day.

With pending lawsuits, they couldn't even contact their fans who had been injured or lost friends and family. Hi, I'm Jennifer. Thankfully, we are in a place now where we can be human about it. You have to understand, this was something that we all experienced together. We had crew who were injured. We were about to go -- the whole thing was quite traumatic and even recently on this tour, we did an outside gig. And it was very rainy. And it was very, very windy. And I had basically a PTSD moment where I was just like -- I grabbed his hand and just -- Yeah, you did. Drew him over to the side. And said, \"I am like freaking out right now.\" This was something that was traumatic for all of us. And for us to be denied the opportunity to be able to make that human connection was hard, so getting able to do that now is so healing.

Reporter: And every year tens of thousands of them line up around the country hoping for a shot to be discovered on \"American idol.\" So you're 21 from what part of Oklahoma? Checotah. Checotah? Sounds like a very small town. I loved \"American idol,\" I mean I truly did, and I loved watching the innocence of the American dream unfold. People were all over the country get in line, they're chasing a song, a dream. The show definitely has a deep-rooted connection to country music. ??? I walk the line ??? Reporter: And as we've seen for decades, when country music and television team up, it's a powerful duo. ??? I'm here to tell \"You\" got to lay off my man ??? Reporter: So many legendary country careers were launched on TV from dolly. This is the pretty little lady that's with us each week, miss dolly parton. ??? What else can we do ??? Reporter: To this adorable young aussie. That's a 16-year-old Keith urban. To Miranda lambert and Chris young on \"Nashville star.\" Today, \"Idol\" is a bonafide starmaker for country talent. And it all started with Carrie Underwood. ??? On the stereo ??? Carrie is just, like, the queen of country music. Reporter: But before her reign, she was just another kid waiting in line, aching for that big break. ??? Oh here in the dark ??? Okay, that was very good. Yes. Carrie, you're through to the next round. Welcome to Hollywood, girl. I'd never been in an airport before. My dad, on the way to the airport, I was about to cry. And he said, \"You know, if you wanna go home, we can go home and you don't ever have to think about this ever again.\" And I was like, oh, but I will think about it. So I have to. I will make a prediction. Not only will you win this, you will sell more oreos than any other previous \"Idol\" winner. Here we go. That never gets old. Standing on the stage, having a card that says, \"The next American idol is\" and the history that comes with that. The winner of \"American idol\" 2005 is Carrie Underwood! A lot of successful people have stood right there. Reporter: Carrie's \"Idol\" win inspired this teenager in a tiny North Carolina town who was working as a waitress, future country music sensation Kellie pickler. I went, \"Maybe country girls can do this too!\" ??? I'm always walking after midnight searching for you ??? Kellie, tonight is the end for you. Reporter: Kelp -- Kellie finished sixth. And proved you don't have to take the top spot to come out a winner on \"Idol.\" ??? I've been sitting around waiting too long trying to figure you out ??? Reporter: Back in 2010, I visited her after her first album went gold and she had just purchased her new home. She confided in me how much life had changed. Do you pinch yourself sometimes? I do. I cannot believe that I've been blessed as much as I have. Reporter: And now eight years later, she's got even more blessings to count. Wooo! Did you see what happened? Reporter: She's in her second season of hosting a daytime talk show, \"Pickler & Ben.\" Made my dreams become a reality. And I will forever be grateful to have been a part of the show. Reporter: A couple years after Kellie's star turn, a 16-year-old boy made a huge impression at his audition. I'll never forget Scotty Mccreery. And I can still close my eyes and see him -- ??? baby lock them doors and turn the lights down low ??? ??? put some music on that's soft and slow and baby we ain't got no place to go ??? It was so signature and so perfect. Scotty Mccreery! Reporter: After Scotty's \"Idol\" win, instead of heading out on the road 24/7, he headed back to his high school to finish his senior year. Somebody told me, they said, \"Scotty, when you left, you were Scotty Mccreery. When you came back, you were Scotty Mccreery. You haven't changed. Hollywood hasn't got to you. Reporter: And now seven years later, he's gone from walking down the halls of his high school, to walking down the aisle. ??? So take my hand ??? ??? take it in this is the moment we won't forget ??? I'm pretty sure 2018 has been my favorite year. Between getting married, between having my first number one single, putting another album out. I'd like to think that I haven't changed too much as a person. Ah, I still have my same friends that I grew up with. Ah, my wife, I've known since kindergarten. My life has changed tremendously, but, you know, inside, I'm the same guy. Reporter: Scotty's runner-up that year, another country singer, Lauren Alaina. Today, you can find her at the top of the country charts, too. ??? The boots and kick off the gravel don't be afraid take a road less traveled on ??? ??? rock me like a southbound train ??? Reporter: As \"Idol\" keeps churning out country stars, it's only natural that one of the judges is one of the biggest names in country music, my old friend Luke Bryan. A true thing of beauty, I feel like I should have paid a cover charge. When I meet a talented person or when I see like somebody has a god-given ability to sing, like I become like -- I just melt. You just slayed it in my opinion, bud. He's blessed with a gift of being able to perform, but he feels grateful that a boy out of Georgia had a shot and made something out of it. And I think he sees that with other contestants too. Auditions start now! Reporter: Now take a good look at the faces of these people lining up to audition for the next season of \"American idol.\" Chances are, some of them may be the next big names in country music. That's what I love about \"Idol\" is it could be your next-door neighbor that's the next \"American idol.\" I was the grocery store bagger in high school, baseball\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Germany's interior minister on Monday denied reports that he was planning on stepping down as the nation's top security official but said he will relinquish his post as leader of the sister party to that of Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nHorst Seehofer told reporters at an event in the eastern city of Bautzen that rumors he was resigning as interior minister were incorrect.\n\n\"I am the federal interior minister and I continue to serve in that office,\" the 69-year-old said.\n\nSeehofer has clashed frequently with Merkel, primarily over her policies on migration. The friction between the two threatened to bring down the chancellor's coalition government earlier this year over his insistence that some categories of asylum-seekers should be turned away at the country's borders.\n\nMore recently, Seehofer's backing of domestic intelligence chief Hans-Georg Maassen over comments he made downplaying the extent of violence in anti-migrant protests in the eastern city of Chemnitz put him at odds again with Merkel as well as with other cabinet ministers.\n\nMerkel's junior coalition partner Social Democrats had demanded Maassen's removal from the BfV spy agency in September after the comments.\n\nMaassen was removed, and on Monday the ministry confirmed it was replacing him with longtime civil servant Thomas Haldenwang.\n\nDespite staying on as interior minister, Seehofer confirmed that he had decided to step down from the Christian Social Union, which operates only in Bavaria as the partner of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union.\n\n\"Change is a part of life,\" he said, adding he'd announce specifics on timing later in the week.\n\nSeehofer stepped down as Bavarian governor earlier this year in favor of a younger rival, Markus Soeder, but clung to the post of CSU leader until the party's dismal result in September's regional elections increased the pressure for him to leave.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFrank Jordans contributed to this story.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been corrected to say that the friction in the coalition was earlier this year, not last year.", "Transcript for Country stars reflect on 10 years of 'Countdown to the CMAs' specials: Part 6\n\nReporter: Most people know I'm a southern girl, very proud of my southern roots.

From Nashville, and from what is arguably the most famous stage in country music, this is the home of Nashville royalty. We're not just counting down the top 15 crossover songs, we're having a concert. Since we are in music city, what do you say we get right to it? I love robin. I mean, but I thought she and I kind of had like a thing, you know, like a really special thing, but then I realized everybody loves robin, so she's like friends with pretty much everyone in Nashville now. Ten years ago and robin really started, you know, coming to Nashville. She saw something special in the city, saw something special in the music. So it was a really big deal for country music and for Nashville. Reporter: Ladies and gentlemen, please help me welcome to the grand ole opry stage -- When you started, you know, doing robin's special -- ??? everybody let's rock ??? that was when one of those times that I thought, \"This is crazy, this is actually a cool time. I'm actually becoming a part of country music.\" ??? Almost heaven West Virginia ??? I love that robin gives all the artists that kind of freedom to just run with it and find something that means something to them and be able to perform that. The way country music has been embraced on such a national level thanks to people like robin for the last ten years, it's really helped us as artists kind of grow our careers. ???

I wait around all day to play. That's what I do. ??? When the sun comes down the stars come out can you feel it I take her by the hand ??? We've been opening this tour with \"Never comin' down.\" It's good sentiment. It's a good energy. It just feels right. It's a good way to open a show. Yeah. ??? Tell me now tell me now ??? ??? never coming down ??? I'm in the moment all the time. I mean, 98% of the time. If I'm not in it, I recognize it really quick and pull myself out of it 'cause I play, because I'm moving around, because you sort of -- this -- you know, vigilance is key. So I don't go running off the stage. Everybody brings signs out, all kinds of things written on signs. And I'm looking for something interesting, just something that gets my attention. It says \"I dressed my husband up to look like you.\" The best one, many, many, many years ago, was somebody way up high had this huge sign that said, \"I pay your bills. I wanna meet you.\" I'm, like, \"Yep. Totally.\" Reporter: Keith urban is as \"At home\" in Brooklyn's Barclays center as he is in the global arena. He's New Zealand born, Australian raised, and 100% Nashville. The ground floor of what I do, the base foundation of who I am is a country artist. It's what I grew up playing. So it's the deepest in my DNA. And then the next level up -- you know when they cut the side of mountains and you see all those eras? Country would be the bottom one for me. That's my -- that's my solid bedrock. And then the next one on that would probably be radio-type songs, catchy choruses and hooks and great rhythm and great beat and universal themes. ??? Just another rebel in the great wide open on the boulevard of broken dreams ??? ??? and I learned everything I kneed to know from John cougar, John Deere John 3:16 ??? Reporter: The talented musician and lauded artist is also known to some for his movie star marriage. This was a second anniversary gift from my wife. Ah. It was a magical morning, I got to say. Reporter: It was in 2011 that Keith first invited us home for our third cma special. If someone who hadn't met Nicole, how would you describe her to them? Extremely pure spirit, a really, really extraordinarily rare, I think, pure spirit. I'll spend the rest of my life trying to find the right words 'cause it's, you know, words are limiting. Reporter: In this case words are part of your craft but when it comes to her -- I'm glad they're only part of it. I'm glad music plays a role too, 'cause music is that other -- the larger language, you know, that goes beyond the -- the limitations of words. Reporter: During that show, Keith opened up about his growing family, the long road to fame, and overcoming addiction. Is it a struggle to stay sober? It was a struggle to live the life I was living before. Yeah, that's -- that's what the actual real struggle is. Once -- once, once anyone can sort of say, \"I'd like to surrender and move in another direction,\" when I stopped fighting, life ceased to be a war. And that's -- that's really the perfect way to put it. ??? Rhythm and woman/child feeling ??? Reporter: While Keith and Nicole have been known to collaborate singing on his Instagram account, their greatest collaboration remains daughters Sunday rose and faith Margaret. I just love being a parent. I didn't know that I'd ever get to be one. So, it's -- it's an incredible feeling. And having girls, I love having girls. You know, I come from a family with no sisters, one brother. So, it's been quite the learning curve. Reporter: Keith and Nicole celebrated their 12th wedding anniversary this year. Having a celebrity marriage fuels constant interest. Well, I mean, we have a real life in the sense that we do the most Normal things. And we don't live on social media all the time. We don't read tabloids. So, it just floats by us all the time that we don't give it any attention. We just have a real life. Reporter: Part of that \"Real life\" is Keith's commitment to others. ??? Oh ??? just last month, the singer visited an Ohio hospice to spend time with Marissa English, who calls herself his biggest fan. ??? You don't need that guy no you don't ??? For me to know that somebody likes my music like Marissa does, and I have the chance to go and see her, then absolutely I'm gonna do that. Music's an incredible language of the heavens. And I fully believe in it, that it's here for that kind of healing and connectedness. ??? You don't need that guy, no, you don't, Marisa ??? Reporter: Keith connects to his audience through what he calls the \"Incredible language of music.\" ??? I wake up feeling ??? his ninth studio album, \"Graffiti U,\" is an evolution of the artist's process, refined and reworked with collaborative style. It's a combination of everything from ever making records. ??? Nothing in the world that feels like coming home ??? Reporter: This year Keith earned three cma award nominations, album of the year, male vocalist of the year, and entertainer of the year. I mean, all three, good lord. I mean, they represent absolutely -- entertainer is, like, that's -- I've been performing live since I was 7 years old. It's extraordinary to get those nominations. ??? When the sun goes down and the stars come out ??? ??? when I take her by the hand ??? the best feeling I have is going off and then coming back out for an encore and everybody's still here.

They were in good condition and the aircraft carrier has since returned to normal operations, the Navy said.\n\nThe cause of the crash is under investigation.\n\nThe crash was the second involving aircraft belonging to the USS Ronald Reagan in less than a month.\n\nIn mid-October, a MH-60 Seahawk crashed shortly after takeoff, causing non-fatal injuries to a dozen sailors.\n\nThe aircraft carrier participated in a joint exercise known as \"Keen Sword\" with Japan and Canada from Oct. 29 to Nov. 8 in waters around Japan and near Guam in the Pacific.\n\nThe F/A-18 was part of Carrier Air Wing 5 onboard the Ronald Reagan, the Navy said.", "The Pakistani government, already struggling with a crisis surrounding a Christian woman acquitted of blasphemy charges after eight years on death row, now has to deal with \"fake\" images on social media purporting to show her outside the country.\n\nThe deceptive images have prompted death threats to a lawmaker shown in one photograph, and are likely intended to whip up radical religious fervor over Aasia Bibi's case. It's unclear who is behind the circulation of the images.\n\nRadical Islamists have held mass protests and demanded that she be publicly executed. They've also filed a petition to repeal her Supreme Court acquittal. The government says Bibi remains in Pakistan, at a secret location for her own protection, until the review process is finished.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan has warned hard-line groups against using her plight to further their political aims with street protests.\n\nHe has defended the Supreme Court judges who on Oct. 21 acquitted the 54-year old mother of five of blasphemy charges. But he has also acquiesced to demands by the Islamists that the acquittal be reviewed in an appeal process.\n\nBlasphemy is a highly charged issue in Pakistan, where mere allegations of insulting Islam or the Prophet Muhammad can incite mobs into a frenzy of violence. The charge carries the death penalty, and critics say the blasphemy law is abused to settle religious scores.\n\nInformation Minister Fawad Chaudhry slammed the \"fake\" postings on Monday, one of which claims to show Bibi meeting Pope Francis. The photo is actually of Bibi's daughter from two years ago. Bibi and her family have always maintained her innocence and say she never insulted Islam's prophet.\n\nChaudhry said the images misidentifying Bibi prompted death threats to a lawmaker in one photograph, Fazal Khan from the ruling Tehreek-e-Insaf Party. The lawmaker's constituency is in a deeply conservative region in the country's northwest.\n\n\"People can even be killed because of such fake postings,\" Chaudhry said. The pictures were widely circulated on social media in Pakistan and shared on several local journalists' groups, even a police and a media group.\n\n\"We are trying to seek cooperation from and against such fake news,\" Chaudhry added.\n\nBibi's ordeal dates back to 2009 when she went to fetch water for herself and fellow farmworkers. An argument took place after two Muslim women refused to drink from the same container as Bibi, who is Roman Catholic. The women later said Bibi had insulted the Prophet Muhammad, and she was charged with blasphemy. She was put on trial, convicted and sentenced to death in 2010.\n\nFollowing Bibi's acquittal last month, the founder of the radical Tehreek-e-Labbak Party, Mohammed Afzal Qadri, issued a fatwa calling for the death of the three Supreme Court judges who handed down the acquittal and the overthrow of Khan's government. He also incited the military to mutiny.\n\nIn 2011, the governor of Punjab province was killed by his own guard after he defended Bibi and criticized the blasphemy law. A year later, the minister for minorities was shot and killed.\n\nBibi, who was freed from detention last week, is being held at a secret, closely guarded location in Pakistan. Those who are familiar with her circumstances say she is expected to remain there until the Supreme Court carries out the review.\n\nOn Sunday, the prime minister said the Supreme Court's decision would be final. For now, it's unclear when the review will be held or who would defend Bibi. Her lawyer, Saiful Malook, fled the country following her acquittal, fearing for his life.", "Asian markets were mostly higher on Monday ahead of key economic data, such as industrial production figures from China and Japan later in the week.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 added 0.1 percent to 22,269.88.

So now we're headed south, the area in between south shore and Hyde park. Where the museum of science and industry is, where the library -- Obama presidential center is gonna be -- Reporter: How important was it to put it there? It was important for both me and Barack, because, first of all, we both lived together in south shore. We lived in Hyde park. This -- these communities are ours. Our kids went to school here. I grew up here. So symbolically it was important. Reporter: Important. A landmark that she hopes will give a boost to the community that gave her and her family so much. The presidential center, the library can play a big role in bringing resources and tourism and jobs and opportunity to the south side. Good job, daddy. I did it. Reporter: And another Obama legacy, her daughters Sasha and Malia. I say this to my kids now, this is one of the greatest lessons that my mother taught me is that children -- you aren't raising babies. They're only gonna be cute and little for a little while. But then they grow up and they have to be adults in the world. And everything we do as a parent with our children, we're preparing them for adulthood. Reporter: Those two children who came into the white house as little girls left as accomplished young women. 17-year-old Sasha will graduate from Sidwell friends high school this spring, and after taking a gap year, 20-year-old Malia is now a sophomore at Harvard. It's a big day for me because I am finished with my book, and I can't wait to share it with the world. Reporter: In a rare move for a first lady, or really any other book author, Mrs. Obama will be touring the country, not in book stores but to sold out arenas. First stop, Chicago's 23,000 seat united center, moderated by Oprah Winfrey. You excited about the book? I am. I'm excited. I'm a little nervous. Reporter: Why? Well, because it -- it's -- it's my work being put out there, just like anything. It's, like, you know, I'm still that kid, \"What grade am I getting? Did I do okay? Do people like it?\" So I'm excited and anxious to, you know, see what people get from it. I'm hoping that it generates a conversation. Reporter: In her own words, Michelle Obama writing to inspire the next generation. There's power in allowing yourself to be known and heard, in owning your unique story, in using your authentic voice. And there's grace in being willing to know and hear others. This, for me, is how we become. Reporter: What do you want your legacy to be?

Reporter: With those seven simple words Michelle Obama took center stage at the 2016 democratic convention. I want a president who will teach our children that everyone in this country matters, a president who truly believes in the vision that our founders put forth all those years ago that we are all created equal, each a beloved part of the great American story. Reporter: In her book Mrs. Obama writes this about the speech. We were now up against a bully challenging the dignity of our country with practically his every utterance. Crooked Hillary Clinton. It was dignity I wanted to make an appeal for. Reporter: An appeal she would continue to make just weeks before that presidential election. A now infamous tape surfaced of Donald Trump talking about grabbing women by their private parts. This is not Normal. This is not politics as usual. This is disgraceful. It is intolerable. Reporter: For Mrs. Obama the stakes could not have been higher. She writes -- I articulated my rage and my fear, along with my faith that with this election Americans understood the true nature of what they were choosing between. What you haven't said before, you said, \"I will always wonder about what led so many, women in particular, to reject an exceptionally qualified female candidate and instead choose a misogynist as their president.\" Some powerful words. I implored people to focus and to think about what it takes to be commander in chief. It's amazing to me that we still have to tell people about the importance of voting. You know, that almost every two years, we're having this conversation to get people to the polls. And in the end, that's how our democracy works. People have to be educated, they have to be focused on the issues and they have to go to the polls if they want their politics to reflect their values. That day I was feeling everything all at once, tired, proud, distraught, eager. Reporter: On January 20th, 2017, the nation watched the peaceful transition of power from president Obama to president trump. Mrs. Obama, in her own words, describes coming to terms with the new reality before her. The vibrant diversity of the two previous inaugurations was gone. Someone from Barack's administration might have said that the optics there were bad, that what the public saw didn't reflect the president's reality or ideals. But in this case, maybe it did. Realizing it, I made my own optic adjustment -- I stopped even trying to smile. Reporter: People want to -- to hear more from you about what's currently going on. And there is a fine line that you and your husband, as previous administrations have done, is that you have to step back and let the current one do what it's doing. But I think it's safe to say that during your husband's presidency, it was no drama Obama. No drama Obama. So what goes through your mind when you read and hear all that's going on right now with this administration? I said what I continue to say. Being the commander in chief is a hard job, and you need to have discipline, and you need to read and you need to be knowledgeable. You need to know history, you need to be careful with your words. But voters make those decisions. And once the voters have spoken, you know, we live with what we live with. Reporter: In her book she writes -- Our presence in the white house had been celebrated by millions of Americans, but it also contributed to a reactionary sense of fear and resentment among others. The hatred was old and deep and as dangerous as ever. Reporter: There's some people that feel that the seed of discontent that led to Donald Trump being elected president, that the seed of that discontent happened during your husband's presidency. I would like to indulge the question, but it requires a level of speculation about how people are feeling and thinking that I don't have. And I think we're gonna have to figure that out as a nation. Reporter: Although no longer first lady and self-proclaimed mom-in-chief, Mrs. Obama continues to shine a light on issues plaguing urban communities like her beloved Chicago's south side. How is Chicago and, in particular, your neighborhood, how is it the same, when you were growing up, and how is it different? You know, when we moved in, it was a coveted neighborhood. But from time I was young until the time I was high school, it became a neighborhood that you didn't wanna live in. Reporter: Wow. Just that time -- And that, you know, that's the story of urban neighborhoods all over the country. Reporter: Not just Chicago. Not just Chicago. Over on this area, this is north Kenwood. This is where hadiya Pendleton's family lived. Reporter: 15-year-old hadiya Pendleton, an honor student from the south side, was gunned down in a public park in Chicago a week after performing with her high school band at president Obama's 2013 inauguration. For Mrs. Obama the teen's death was very personal. And let me tell you, it is hard to know what to say to a room full of teenagers who are about to bury their best friend. Reporter: She writes -- Put simply, I could have known her. I could have been her once even. And had she taken a different route home from school that day, or even moved six inches left instead of six inches right when the gunfire started, she could have been me. You're in the wrong place at the wrong time. Even if you're doing the right thing, you could lose your life. Kids wake up each day believing in the goodness of things, in the magic of what might be.

That's it. ?????? Now that I taught myself. I grew up in a household of music. Music was important and it still is. It really set me on a course. Good afternoon. Welcome to the white house. Reporter: Mrs. Obama says she used music as a way to open up the white house and to bring more diverse voices into the space. It's the people's house. It's a place that's steeped in history, but also it's a place where we like to start new traditions. ?????? It was important to me for young people to know that the white house was theirs too.

They could eat the food as well and meet the entertainers. And did it mean something to bring something different to the white house, different music that had not been played there before? Different music, different people, absolutely. I mean it's why our first cultural event was spoken word. ??? The $10 founding father without a father ??? Reporter: It was at that event where she first met playwright and composer Lin Manuel Miranda. He said he was going to perform a Meese on Alexander Hamilton. ??? His name is Alexander Hamilton ??? And Barack and I almost laughed in his face. And he went out and performed the first number of the now award winning musical. And afterwards he said, \"I think I'm gonna go and turn this into a Broadway show.\" You laugh but it's true. And we were like, \"Good luck with that, kid.\" Reporter: And the rest, as they say, is history. Beyond the white house, Mrs. Obama's influence continues to touch younger generations. Perhaps nowhere is she a bigger role model than at her ALMA mater, Whitney young high school on Chicago's west side, home of the dolphins. It was here that a teenage Michelle Robinson continued to find her voice unafraid to be young, gifted and black. You were encouraged to work hard here and to excel. And it wasn't unusual. And, you know, so I felt free here. Reporter: We brought Mrs. Obama back to the high school to drop in on a dance class with the help of the school's principal, Dr. Joyce kenner. Okay, so here we go. Reporter: The class is rehearsing for an upcoming performance and thinks the camera crew is there to film it. Can I have everybody's attention? Can you turn that off? You guys, we have a very special guest for you guys to meet and be introduced to. How are you guys doing? What's happening? Who's that? Oh, my goodness. Look at you guys. So what, what, what is this? What are you all doing? Yeah? You know, I wasn't, like, in a dance troupe like you guys. I was, like, doing my kick with a bad extension. You know my knee wasn't straight, my toe wasn't really pointed. But there was effort there in that face. I was never as good as any of you. But just being able to have, you know, music and dance and arts that fueled me. I know you see her right now. And you would not know that she walked around in these halls saying, \"Am I good enough?\" I talked about this -- I write about a story here where the college counselor, I wanted to apply to princeton. She told me I wasn't princeton material. Can you imagine that? She doesn't work here anymore. But that was just one of many examples of the doubters. Instead of walking away going, \"Yeah, you're right, maybe she's right,\" I would always think, \"I'll show you.\" And I'm gonna work hard and I'm gonna make sure that people know that I am substantive and smart and kind and patriotic and hard working. All right. I'm going to get out of your hair because you guys have big things. You gotta practice. Can we dance for you? Yes. I would love that. Oh, yes. We're performing for Michelle Obama. ??? Inside my mouth I can narrow the voice over the ledge see you again ??? You can do that? Is that what you all are doing in this room? I'm so proud of you. I'm gonna cry. You guys are gonna make me cry. Do not doubt anything. Anything. If you can get out here, look you got cameras and secret service and robin Roberts. The first lady. The first lady. I mean you guys just did that like, whatever. Could we get you to sign the poster? Yes. Reporter: And the visit would not be complete without signing that poster. That's beautiful. We love you. I would love to hug each and\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Interested in Israel? Add Israel as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Israel news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nPalestinian militants bombarded Israel with dozens of rockets and mortar shells Monday, while Israeli warplanes struck targets throughout the Gaza Strip in what appeared to be the most intense exchange of fire since a 2014 war.\n\nPalestinian officials said at least three people, including two militants, were killed by Israeli fire and nine were wounded, and an Israeli airstrike destroyed the ruling Hamas group's TV station. In Israel, the national rescue service said at least 20 people were wounded, including a 19-year-old soldier and a 60-year-old woman who were in critical condition.\n\nEarly Tuesday, Israeli media reported that a man was found dead under the rubble of a building in the southern coastal city of Ashkelon hit by Gaza rockets.\n\nGaza's health ministry, meanwhile, said a 22-year-old Palestinian who was wounded in an earlier airstrike died, putting the Palestinian death toll since the current flare-up started late Sunday to 11, the majority of them militants.\n\nThe fighting cast doubt over recent understandings brokered by Egypt and U.N. officials to reduce tensions. Just a day earlier, Israel's prime minister had defended those understandings, saying he was doing everything possible to avoid another war.\n\nThe United Nations said it was working with Egypt to broker a halt in the violence. \"Rockets must STOP, restraint must be shown by all!\" the U.N. Mideast envoy's office tweeted.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, meanwhile, urged Israel and the Palestinians \"to exercise maximum restraint,\" according to a statement.\n\nThe rocket fire was triggered by a botched Israeli military raid in Gaza on Sunday. Undercover troops, apparently on a reconnaissance mission, were discovered inside Gaza on Sunday, setting off a battle that left seven militants, including a Hamas commander, and an Israeli military officer dead.\n\nAround sundown Monday, militants launched some 100 rockets in less than an hour, the most intense barrage since the 50-day war four years ago. The outgoing rockets, which continued into the evening, lit up the skies of Gaza and set off air raid sirens throughout southern Israel.\n\nBy early Tuesday, at least 300 rockets had been launched from Gaza, the Israeli military said, adding that up to 70 of them were intercepted by the anti-missile defense system Iron Dome.\n\nThe military said warplanes, helicopters and tanks had struck over 70 militant targets, including military compounds, observation posts and weapons facilities. It also said it targeted a squad that was launching rockets.\n\nThe airstrikes and rocket barrages resumed at dawn after nearly two hours of calm.\n\nLt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said the army had sent additional infantry troops, rocket defense systems and intelligence units to the Gaza frontier.\n\n\"We continue to strike and retaliate against the military targets belonging to terrorist organizations in Gaza, and as for our intentions we will enhance these efforts as needed,\" he told reporters.\n\nLate Monday, an airstrike destroyed the Gaza City headquarters of Hamas' Al Aqsa TV station. Israel had fired warning shots ahead of the airstrike, prompting the station to halt programming and replace it with a logo. Minutes later, the airstrike flattened the three-story building and the station went black.\n\nWorkers had evacuated the building after the warning shots, and there were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nHamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum condemned the bombing as \"a barbaric, brazen aggression.\" Ten minutes later, the station resumed broadcasts, airing prerecorded national songs.\n\nIsrael said the station \"broadcasts violent propaganda\" and provides \"operational messaging\" to militants. A five-story office building that housed Hamas media offices and another building used by Hamas' internal security service were also destroyed. No casualties were reported.\n\nHamas and the smaller militant group Islamic Jihad said the rocket fire was revenge for Sunday night's Israeli incursion. Islamic Jihad spokesman Daoud Shehab said the groups wanted \"the occupation and its supporters know that the lives of our sons come with a price.\"\n\nIn all, well over 300 rockets were fired into Israel by midnight, the army said. The Israeli military said it intercepted 70 rockets, and most of the others fell in open spaces. But rockets landed in the southern Israeli town of Sderot, setting off a large fire near a shopping center. Several homes were hit in southern towns, including one that was destroyed in Ashkelon. Around midnight, a rocket struck another building in Ashkelon, wounding at least 10 people, including one woman in critical condition, according to police and rescue workers.\n\nEarlier, a bus was struck by an anti-tank missile, critically wounding a 19-year-old soldier. The strike set the bus on fire, sending a large plume of black smoke over the area. Gaza militants released a video of what they said was the attack, showing a bus pulling up to an open area before going up in flames. The video, with ominous music playing, showed Israeli soldiers milling about the area.\n\nMichael Oren, an Israeli Cabinet minister, said Israel \"will do whatever it takes\" to defend itself. \"We expect the world to stand with us,\" he said.\n\nThe EU's ambassador to Israel, Emanuele Giaufret, called for a halt in \"indiscriminate\" rocket fire toward civilians. \"Everyone must step back from the brink,\" he said.\n\nEarlier Monday, thousands of Palestinian mourners buried the seven militants killed in Sunday's incursion. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh led a funeral as masked gunmen in uniforms carried coffins and mourners chanted \"revenge.\"\n\nHamas set up checkpoints across Gaza in a show of force. It also restricted movement through crossings with Israel, preventing foreign journalists, local businessmen and some aid workers from leaving the territory.\n\nHamas also canceled a weekly beach protest in northwestern Gaza along the border with Israel. The organizers cited \"the ongoing security situation.\"\n\nIsrael and Hamas have fought three wars since the Islamic militant group seized control of Gaza from the internationally-backed Palestinian Authority in 2007. In the most recent war, over 2,200 Palestinians were killed, more than half of them civilians, and tens of thousands were left homeless. Seventy-three people were killed on the Israeli side.\n\nIsrael and Egypt have maintained a blockade on Gaza since the Hamas takeover. The blockade has devastated Gaza's economy.\n\nFor over seven months, Hamas has been leading protests along the Israeli border aimed in large part at breaking the blockade. More than 170 Palestinians, most unarmed, have been killed by Israeli fire during the protests. Israel says it is defending its border against militant infiltration attempts.\n\nIn recent weeks, Egyptian and U.N. mediators had appeared to make progress in brokering informal understandings aimed at quieting the situation.\n\nLast week, Israel allowed Qatar to deliver $15 million to Gaza to allow cash-strapped Hamas to pay the salaries of thousands of government workers. At the same time, Hamas has lowered the intensity of the border protests in recent weeks.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a visit to Paris because of the flare-up and returned to Israel on Monday for consultations with top security officials.\n\nThe Hamas military wing said that in Sunday's incursion, Israeli undercover forces drove about 3 kilometers (2 miles) into southeastern Gaza and shot and killed a mid-level commander in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis. Hamas militants discovered the car and chased it, prompting Israeli airstrikes that killed several people, the group said.\n\nThe military provided few details about Sunday's raid. The Israeli military chief, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, said a \"special force\" carried out \"a very meaningful operation to Israel's security,\" without elaborating.\n\nIn a tweet after his arrival back home, Netanyahu praised the slain officer, whose identity was kept confidential for security reasons, and said \"our forces acted courageously.\" The officer's funeral was held Monday.\n\nOn Sunday, Netanyahu defended his decision to allow through the Qatari cash to Gaza as a way to avert an \"unnecessary war,\" maintain quiet for residents of southern Israel and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in the impoverished Gaza Strip.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Fares Akram reported in Gaza City and AP writer Josef Federman reported from Jerusalem. AP writer Isabel DeBre in Jerusalem contributed to this report.", "Transcript for Michelle Obama on the bruising campaign to the White House: Part 3\n\nBy the summer of 2004 Barack Obama was already a rising star when he was asked to speak at the DNC national convention. There is not a liberal America and a conservative America. There is the United States of America. Barack Obama, a name that you're going to hear a lot in the future days. A meteoric rise that would lead to Barack Obama's own candidacy in 2007. I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for president of the United States of America. As much as you love your husband and gave him your blessing to run for president, you didn't think he would win. Oh, yeah. Not that he shouldn't win. Uh-huh. And you saw \"Time\" magazine, and I think it was like October 2006, and on the cover it says, \"Could Barack Obama be the next president?\" And you looked away. Uh-huh. You didn't even want to see that. Why? I think I did what a lot of black folks were doing. We were afraid to hope because it's hard to believe that the country that oppressed you could one day be led by you, you know? I mean, my grandparents, you know, lived through segregation. My grandfather, his grandfather was a slave, you know? So this -- these memories were real, and they didn't think the country was ready, and so my attitude was a reflection of that skepticism. That's the thing, it's inconsistent. Ten years ago we were sitting down in Norfolk, Virginia. This is pre-white house, and I want you to take a look, and tell me what you see about this version of yourself. I am Michelle Obama. I live in Chicago. I'm married to this guy Barack. That's about it. That's about how I see myself. And that is how you see yourself. Yeah, yeah. We got these great little girls, and they crack us up. You know, we want to make the world a better place. That's who we are. Wow. What do you wish you could tell your pre-white house self? Whew. You know, the hard parts were the things that I expected. That it was gonna be hard, you know? So much of this country lives in isolation, and we just don't know each other. And so there were people who didn't know what a black woman was and sounded like, and so I knew that was going to be a challenge that I'd have to earn my grace. Can we do this? The campaign trail would test her resilience. People called me Barack's baby mama, you know? Accused me of not loving my country. You know, told me I was angry. You know, it was the first time I really experienced someone taking my voice and balling it up and distorting it. And I was, like, \"This isn't me. Wait, wait, people. This isn't who I am.\" I remember talking to you during the campaign about the criticism, and you said you didn't really pay attention to it. In the book, you admit it. Yeah. You said, \"This stuff hurt.\" Yeah, yeah. \"This stuff hurt.\" I don't think we do each other a service by pretending like hurtful things don't hurt. And that's what I've come to -- I came to after that experience. I need to own that hurt. I need to talk about it. I need to put it out there for myself so that I can heal from it, but at the time, oh, gosh, you know? I wasn't going to allow myself to feel victimized from it because there was no time to hurt in that role. Barack Obama will be the 44th president of the United States. I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend, the nation's next first lady Michelle Obama. For Michelle the hurt would continue straight into the white house with calls for president Obama's birth certificate, questioning his legitimacy. She writes -- Its underlying bigotry and xenophobia hardly concealed, but it was also dangerous, deliberately meant to stir up the wingnuts and kooks. What if someone with an unstable mind loaded a gun and drove to Washington? What if that person went looking for our girls? Why doesn't he show his birth certificate? Donald Trump with his loud and reckless innuendos was putting my family's safety at risk, and for this, I'd never forgive him. Michelle says she had little choice but to push the fears away. Welcome to the white house. And focus on the business of becoming the first lady. Launching initiatives like let's move, joining forces, and let girls learn. Empower yourself with a good education. With no official job description each first lady makes the role her own. Is the current first lady -- how do you think she is doing in defining who she is? You know, one of the things you learn as a former, it's like, I don't judge what a current is doing, you know? So I'd prefer not to, you know, speak on what she's doing versus what I did because I think every first lady approaches this job differently. In 2016, shortly after the election, Michelle met with Melania trump at the white house continuing a long tradition of hosting future first ladies. I know that Laura bush reached out to you and said, if you need any help, I'm a phone call away. Yep, yep. You wrote about how and have talked about how you extended that same courtesy to Melania trump. Has she reached out they and asked -- No. -- For any help?\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Transcript for Michelle Obama opens up about miscarriage, IVF and marriage counseling: Part 2\n\n??? At last my love has come along ??? Reporter: This was the first time America got to know Michelle and Barack Obama as a very romantic, very connected, couple. I remember speaking with the new president just moments after that iconic inaugural ball dance. Mr. President. Sounds good, doesn't it? You know, it's got a certain ring to it. Reporter: But what led up to that golden moment for this couple wasn't always a fairy tale. In her book, Michelle Obama calls this part of her story becoming us about the meeting and marriage that would transform the trajectory of her life and challenge her in ways she would never expect. You ready to talk about Barack? Who? You ready to talk about -- by age 25, Michelle had executed a meticulous game plan for achievement and success. I was a box checker. And I was checking off my box. You know, I got into princeton, great. What am I going to do next? I don't know. Why don't I go to law school? Got into Harvard, I'm going to Harvard, check. You know, got my, you know, got my big firm position, check. Reporter: That big firm position was at the Chicago law firm of Sidley and Austin. You're at this law firm -- Got it all together. You got it all together. I had made a declaration that I was off men. I was focusing on my career. I had my checklist. I was -- You were -- Getting it down. Locked, focused -- Was focused. Reporter: And then she was asked to mentor an incoming summer associate, a man two years older, already rumored to be an exceptionally gifted law student. He's still a law student -- Uh-huh. -- At Harvard. Right. A first year. First year. You're going to be his mentor. He comes blowing into town, a little bit famous already. Late for the first meeting. Late. Late. I was, like, \"Is he trifling? The black man's gonna be late on the first day? I was like, hmm. You weren't overly impressed in the beginning? I wasn't, you know? I have my suspicions when a bunch of white folks fawn on over a black man 'cause I sorta think, \"Okay, he can talk straight so they think he's wonderful.\" So that was my theory. And then his name was Barack Obama. He was from Hawaii. I thought, \"What,\" you know? So I didn't really know what to expect. And then in walks Barack Obama. And Barack Obama has always walked like Barack Obama. Like, he's got all the time in the world. He's -- he had that stride. I was, like, \"Dude, you're cute.\" But in my mind, I was, like -- Not interested? Off limits. Not even not interested. I'm not gonna date the -- one of the few black summer associates. Robin, how tacky, you know? Reporter: But she quickly found herself drawn to him. And by July, her resolve to avoid romance began to falter. We had been hanging out, getting closer. Barack had suggested that we date. But I was, like, \"No, no, meet my friends. Do this, do that. It wouldn't be right, no.\" And he was, like, \"You're crazy. We should date. I like you, you like me.\" And he was very -- and I liked that about him. He was very straightforward. He wasn't playing games. I say that to the ladies out there. Not a game play. Very clear about what he wanted. When we stopped for ice cream and he got the sense that I was starting to open up, and he, you know, he played it real smooth. He just leaned in for a kiss. And that really was it. You know, from that kiss on, we were -- it was -- it was love. And he was my -- my man. Do you think I'm cute? I didn't say that. Reporter: Years later, there's an entire movie, \"Southside with you\" based on that first date. You want some? Sure. Reporter: And there's a tribute at the Chicago ice cream shop. You realize there's a plaque there, right? I know! The kids are highly embarrassed that there's a plaque about their parents' first kiss. Reporter: But she doesn't hold back from describing their young passion. There are many things in reading that -- your book that I don't think I would ever imagine hearing from a first lady. Uh-huh. Reporter: Lust. You talked about lust for your man. Uh-huh. That's not something you expect to hear or read from a first lady. But it's there. I don't know what to tell you. It was -- it was there. It still is. I love my husband a lot. Reporter: But while their mutual affection has always been on display, now, for the first time, Michelle is opening up about parts of their marriage she held deeply private for years. First, infertility. It turns out that even two committed go getters with a deep love and a robust work ethic can't will themselves into being pregnant. Reporter: She did get pregnant but then weeks later she miscarried. I felt lost and alone. And I feel -- I felt like I failed because I didn't know how common miscarriages were because we don't talk about 'em. We sit in our own pain, thinking that somehow we're broken. Reporter: She reveals that it was with the help of infertility treatments that Malia, and then Sasha, were finally conceived. The biological clock is real because egg production is limited. And I realized that as I was 34 and 35. We had to do ivf. I think it's the worst thing that we do to each other as women, not share the truth about our bodies and how they work and how they don't work. Reporter: And for the first time she shares details about how the stress of their hectic schedules infiltrated their marriage. You write about at one point in your marriage that you and Barack went to marriage counseling. Uh-huh. Why did you think it was important to share that? Marriage counseling for us was one of those ways where we learned how to talk out our differences. What I learned about myself was that my happiness was up to me. And I started working out more. I started asking for help, not just from him, but from other people. I stopped feeling guilty. I know too many young couples who struggle and think that somehow there's something wrong with them. And I want them to know that Michelle and Barack Obama, who have a phenomenal marriage and who love each other, we work on our marriage. And we get help with our marriage when we need it.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Transcript for From Michelle Obama's humble Chicago upbringing to the White House: Part 1\n\nChicago? I've traveled all over the world, and Chicago still by far is one of the most beautiful cities. Reporter: We're taking a ride around the old neighborhood and back in time with former first lady Michelle Obama. We're on Jeffery boulevard. This was where the rich kids lived. And then you'll see. We'll cross the tracks. Reporter: Uh-oh. And we'll get in my neighborhood. Reporter: Michelle lavaughn Robinson grew up on the humble side of the railroad tracks in a diverse working class part of Chicago. I, Barack Hussain Obama -- Reporter: The world would come to know her as Michelle Obama, America's first lady. The regal woman with the common touch. ??? We in the spot ??? Reporter: As America's first black first family, the Obamas ushered in a modern era to the white house. We are asking Americans of all ages to give us five ways they're leading a healthier life. Reporter: Diversity filled the inner circles. Healthy initiative vegetable gardens grew alongside rose gardens. I know I'm going to be pulling up some radishes. Reporter: And the sound of young children warmed the family residence once again. So we're crossing the tracks. This is still south shore. This was my walk to school. Across the street I usually met my friend Terry Johnson right in front of that garage. This is my block. Reporter: Three generations of Robinsons lived here on euclid avenue, a home owned by Michelle's great aunt Robbie and uncle Terry. Here, aunt Robbie is holding Michelle when she was an infant. So this is the house. This is my house. Reporter: Wow. And that was -- that's where we lived, upstairs. Robbie and Terry lived downstairs. That was my bedroom. So you see the four windows? But I walk in there and I think, my god, how four people who lived a full life in that little, bitty space up there. Yes, yeah. Up until recently this little apartment was sort of our inheritance. So any time anybody hit on hard times, we'd just move back up there, you know? Reporter: Michelle told me she wouldn't run into anyone she knew, but she did. Oh, my god. It's nice to meet you, Mr. Reed. How's everything going in the neighborhood? Going well. How's miss Robinson? She's good, yeah, yeah. We used to see her all the time. I'll tell her that we saw you. Reporter: See, this is what you're talking about. It's a small town. We sat down together in the current Obama home base just five miles north of where she grew up. It's the house the young family called home leading up to their eventual move to Washington. First of all, hey, everybody. Welcome to my house. Reporter: Michelle Obama's new book, \"Becoming\" is a very personal look at her life both inside and out of the white house. She says she hopes the candid book generates conversation. Here I am with a lot I want to say. Reporter: Fraser Robinson, a water plant employee, and his wife Marian, a stay-at-home mom, emphasized education and excellence for their two children. For a young Michelle, navigating the bigger world outside her home sometimes felt like speaking a second language. There was one time you write about that I think you were about 10 years old at the time. And your cousin said to you, why do you talk like a white girl? How do you square who you are, where you come from, with where you want to go? Yeah, yeah. It was one of those kind of moments where it was like, \"Psh, you're not like us.\" And it was because of my speech. At this point the viewers who are watching this, there are a lot of people nodding because when you grew up in the neighborhood, you know, you could get your butt kicked going to school if you looked too uppity or if you were studying too hard. So I had to grow up learning these two languages of how do I fit in with my family and my community and still excel? This wouldn't be the first time that my identity would be challenged. You know, where people couldn't figure out who I was with how I talked and what they -- who they thought I should be. Reporter: Her mother Marian Robinson helped Michelle build a sense of self. Marian is known to many for her dedication to family, famously moving into the first modern white house \"Mother-in-law suite,\" there to help her daughter navigate the demands of raising a private family in a very public house. My parents from very early age encouraged us to put our opinions on the table, to ask questions, to question the context of situations. They encouraged us to understand the context. Reporter: They weren't there to prevent you from falling, but to pick you up when you did. You could speak your mind, but you had to be respectful, you know? And if you got out of hand, you got a look. You'd get a spanking. They weren't free-wheelin' parents. They were still black parents. But they believed in teaching us to think for ourselves. Reporter: Michelle's father gave his children a memorable lesson on the dignity of work and true value of hard earned money. My parents were very clear -- you know, we weren't rich. I remember there was a time my -- my brother wanted to understand 'cause he couldn't get something that he wanted. And my my father laid out all the bills, brought home his paycheck in cash and took every bill and put money on top of it to show what it costs and how much he brought in and what was left. They wanted to make it clear. You know, there was money earned and money that went out. Reporter: Always a star student, Michelle thrived in high school, Chicago's first magnet high school, Whitney young. I was nervous about going. I wondered if I was good enough and could I make it in this highly competitive magnet school. Reporter: You write about fooling around with your boyfriend. Oh, which one? Reporter: Oh, well, it was a high school boyfriend. And you even write about smoking pot. Now, you didn't go into great detail, but you -- you did. You could've left that out. So why did you talk about that? That's what I did. That's part of the becoming story. Everybody had something that they had to work through, something that they were figuring out. Why would I hide that from the next generation? Reporter: In the fall of 1981, Michelle entered princeton university's freshman class. She says princeton was \"Scary.\" Fellow students and mentors gave her the confidence to succeed, as she explained in this Instagram post, sharing a young photo of herself in front of princeton's library. It was the first time I had been in a predominantly white situation. So I had to learn how to adjust in this new world of wealth and privilege and kids that I didn't realize had come from prep schools that had prepared them, and I didn't even know the language of that college. What was a syllabus? Never heard of it. Reporter: You really blazed a path for others. We went back to princeton. We spoke with grads, recent grads and people -- You did? Reporter: Yeah, and people -- and young women who are still in school at princeton. And they spoke about the example that you set for them. I want you to hear it -- Oh, robin. Oh, my gosh. Reporter: Yeah, these -- these are your -- It's just incredible walking the paths of princeton, knowing that Michelle Obama was one here. Oh, my gosh. Knowing that Michelle Obama came from, like, a working class family. Like, Michelle Obama's parents didn't, like, come here and she still came, thrived, found her place and had a productive experience at a school like this, it inspired me. And it's just one of the reasons why I applied to this school. They're standing where I was -- oh, of course, you did that -- She's inspiring us today. And the current students are princeton, the people applying to princeton and just every little girl in America today, I don't think she even knows. Thank you just from the bottom of my heart. I can't thank you enough. And I hope to one day be able to convey that in person. But thank you. Oh, my goodness. Have you ever seen her in person? Is she here? Why did you do that? Reporter: I know, I know. I didn't -- we did feel bad at that point 'cause she thought -- Like she's going to come out -- Reporter: How does that make you feel when you see these young women who said that, because of you, they're there? Yeah, it's -- yeah. So what'd you do that for, robin? It feels, you know, I'm -- I'm glad. I'm glad that they -- Reporter: You proud? Yeah.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "The resignation of a West Virginia Supreme Court justice recently convicted of federal charges prompted the governor Sunday to cancel a special legislative session that was to consider the justice's removal.\n\nIt was the latest development in an impeachment scandal miring some past and present justices in varying accusations including abuse of authority and failure to rein in excessive spending that engulfed the state's highest court for months.\n\nRepublican Gov. Jim Justice's office said late Saturday he received a letter from Justice Allen Loughry and accepted his resignation effective at the close of business Monday. Justice had no further comment and Loughry's one-sentence resignation letter didn't elaborate.\n\nLoughry was convicted last month of federal criminal charges including wire fraud involving his personal use of state cars and fuel cards and mail fraud. He has requested a new trial.\n\nLast week Justice had called the special session for Tuesday, saying in a proclamation that it would consider removing Loughry from his post. Another proclamation Sunday canceled the special session in light of Loughry's resignation.\n\nLoughry couldn't be reached for comment. His attorney, John A. Carr, said in an email he would have no comment.\n\nLoughry and three other justices were impeached by the West Virginia House in August over questions involving lavish office renovations that evolved into varying accusations of corruption, incompetence and neglect of duty. One of them, Justice Beth Walker, was cleared of an impeachment charge at a Senate trial last month.\n\nThe West Virginia Supreme Court last month effectively halted the Legislature's remaining efforts to impeach the state's justices as a violation of the separate of power doctrine. The court ruled that the Senate lacks jurisdiction to pursue its impeachment trial of Justice Margaret Workman.\n\nThe Senate had postponed Workman's trial after the presiding judge didn't show up following the court ruling. A panel of acting justices said the court's decision to stop Workman's impeachment hearing also applies to retired Justice Robin Davis and Loughry, who had petitioned the court to intervene.\n\nSenate President Mitch Carmichael, a Republican, lauded the resignation announcement Saturday.\n\n\"We appreciate that Justice Loughry has decided to do the right thing and step down from the Court,\" Carmichael said in a statement.\n\nJudicial elections in West Virginia became nonpartisan in 2016, but the court's impeachment scandal this year stirred political attacks. Some Democrats argued that the court's shakeup over spending and other issues was a power grab by the Republican-led legislature.\n\nOn Election Day, two state Supreme Court justices appointed to the court after the scandal broke won election to continue on the bench: Former House speaker Tim Armstead and ex-Congressman Evan Jenkins won those races Tuesday night, each defeating nine other candidates. They had originally been appointed by Justice to fill two of the seats on the state's highest court pending the midterm election.\n\nArmstead will complete the term of Justice Menis Ketchum, who announced his resignation on the eve of the House's impeachment proceedings. The term runs through 2020.\n\nJenkins will serve until 2024, when the term of retired Justice Robin Davis ends. Davis also was impeached.", "For President Donald Trump in Paris, America First meant largely America alone.\n\nAt a weekend commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, the president who proudly declares himself a \"nationalist\" stood apart, even on a continent where his brand of populism is on the rise.\n\nHe began his visit with a tweet slamming the French president's call for a European defense force, arrived at events alone and spent much of his trip out of sight in the American ambassadors' residence in central Paris. On Sunday, he listened as he was lectured on the dangers of nationalist isolation, and then he headed home just as the inaugural Paris Peace Summit was getting underway.\n\nBack at the White House on Monday, Trump tweeted that \"much was accomplished\" in his meetings, but voiced a familiar complaint about America's allies. He said the U.S. pays billions \"protecting other countries, and we get nothing but Trade Deficits and Losses.\" He added: \"It is time that these very rich countries either pay the United States for its great military protection, or protect themselves.\"\n\nHis France trip made clear that, nearly two years after taking office, Trump has dramatically upended decades of American foreign policy posture, shaking allies. That includes French President Emmanuel Macron, who on Sunday warned that the \"ancient demons\" that caused World War I and millions of deaths were once again making headway.\n\nMacron, who has been urging a re-embrace of multinational organizations and cooperation that have been shunned by Trump, delivered a barely veiled rebuke of Trumpism at the weekend's centerpiece event: A gathering of dozens of leaders at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the base of the Arc de Triomphe to mark the passage of a century since the guns fell silent in a global war that killed millions. Bells tolled across Europe's Western Front and fighter jets passed overhead to mark the exact moment the devastating war came to a close.\n\nWith Trump and other leaders looking on, Macron took on the rising tide of populism in the United States and Europe and urged leaders not to turn their backs by turning inward.\n\n\"Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism: Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,\" Macron said, adding that, when nations put their interests first and decide \"who cares about the others\" they \"erase the most precious thing a nation can have ... its moral values.\"\n\nAfter Trump was gone, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who recently announced that she will not be seeking re-election, made an impassioned plea for global cooperation at the peace forum, saying World War I had \"made clear what disastrous consequences a lack of compromise in politics and diplomacy can have.\"\n\nTrump, who has made clear that he has limited patience for broad, multilateral agreements, sat mostly stone-faced as he listened to Macron, who sees himself as Europe's foil to the rising nationalist sentiment, which has taken hold in Hungary and Poland among other countries.\n\nTrump did engage with his fellow leaders, attending a group welcome dinner hosted by Macron at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay on Saturday night and a lunch on Sunday. He also spent time with Macron on Saturday, when the two stressed their shared desire for more burden-sharing during a quick availability with reporters.\n\nBut Trump was terse during some of his private conversations with world leaders, according to people with direct knowledge of his visit. One of the people described the president as \"grumpy.\" They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations.\n\nThe symbolism during Trump's visit couldn't have been more stark.\n\nTrump was missing from one of the weekend's most powerful images: A line of world leaders, walking shoulder to-shoulder in a somber, rain-soaked procession as the bells marking the exact moment that fighting ended \u2014 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918 \u2014 finished tolling.\n\nThe president and first lady Melania Trump had traveled to the commemoration separately \u2014 White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited security protocols \u2014 from the other dignitaries, who had traveled together by bus from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nAs Trump's motorcade was making its solo trip down the grand Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, which was closed to traffic, at least one topless woman breached tight security, running into the street and shouting \"fake peace maker\" as the cars passed. She had slogans, including the words \"Fake\" and \"Peace,\" written on her chest.\n\nPolice tackled the woman and the motorcade continued uninterrupted. The feminist activist group Femen later claimed responsibility.\n\nAlso traveling on his own was Russian President Vladimir Putin, who shook Trump's hand, flashed him a thumbs-up sign and patted Trump's arm as he arrived. Trump responded with a wide smile.\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton had said at one point that Putin and Trump would meet in Paris, but they will instead hold a formal sit-down later this month at a world leaders' summit in Buenos Aires. A Kremlin official said later that U.S. and Russian officials decided to drop plans for the Paris meeting after French officials objected.\n\nTrump, who ran on an \"America First\" platform, has jarred European allies with his actions. He has slapped tariffs on the European Union, pulled the U.S. out of the landmark Paris Climate Accord and the Iran nuclear deal and suggested he might be willing to pull the U.S. out of NATO if member counties don't significantly boost their defense spending. Trump's eagerness to get along with the Russian leader \u2014 in spite of Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and numerous other aggressive moves in recent years \u2014 has alarmed those who view Russia as a growing threat.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly branded himself a \"nationalist,\" despite criticism from some that the term has negative connotations. At a news conference last week, Trump defended his use of the phrase. \"You know what the word is? I love our country,\" he said, adding: \"You have nationalists. You have globalists. I also love the world and I don't mind helping the world, but we have to straighten out our country first. We have a lot of problems.\"\n\nBut Trump did not broach the divide as he paid tribute Sunday to U.S. and allied soldiers killed in World War I during \"a horrible, horrible war\" that marked America's emergence as a world power.\n\n\"We are gathered together at this hallowed resting place to pay tribute to the brave Americans who gave their last breath in that mighty struggle,\" Trump said at the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial in the suburbs of Paris, where more than 1,500 Americans who died in the war are buried.\n\n\"It is our duty to preserve the civilization they defended and to protect the peace they so nobly gave their lives to secure one century ago,\" he said after spending a moment, standing alone amid the cemetery's white crosses, holding a black umbrella.\n\nThe Veterans Day speech came a day after Trump was criticized for failing to visit a different American cemetery about 60 miles (100 kilometers) outside of Paris on Saturday because rain grounded the helicopter he had planned to take. A handful of senior administration officials, including White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, went in the president's place, while Trump remained behind at the ambassador's residence with no alternate schedule for hours.\n\nTrump delivered the speech as other leaders were gathered for the Paris Peace Forum, which aims to revive collective governance and international cooperation to tackle global challenges. Afterward he flew back to Washington.\n\nFrance was the epicenter of World War I, the first global conflict. Its role as host of the main international commemoration highlighted the point that the world mustn't stumble into war again, as it did so quickly and catastrophically with World War II.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Robert Burns and Julie Pace in Washington and Lori Hinnant and Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press' WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Superville and Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/dsupervilleap and https://twitter.com/colvinj", "A homeless man who rammed a shopping cart at a knife-wielding attacker who was threatening police is being hailed and rewarded for his actions, but he insists he isn't a hero.\n\nMichael Rogers emerged from a crowd of onlookers during the attack Friday afternoon in downtown Melbourne, Australia, in which one person was fatally stabbed and two others wounded.\n\nSocial media users have dubbed Rogers \"Trolleyman\" and an online fundraiser for him by registered charity Melbourne Homeless Collective had raised more than 100,000 Australian dollars ($72,000) by Monday morning. Shopping carts are called \"trolleys\" in Australia.\n\n\"Our hero is humble as can be and had no idea about this fundraiser,\" the GoFundMe page reads. \"He is amazing. We believe his efforts deserve a reward that can really help him out.\"\n\nIn interviews with Australian media, Rogers, 46, has insisted he's no hero. \"I threw the trolley straight at him, and I got him. I didn't quite get him down, though. I'm no hero,\" he told Channel Seven.\n\nHe also told Melbourne's Age newspaper he had been on the wrong side of the law himself. The paper reported he had been \"in and out of jail\" for some 20 years, including a five-year sentence for aggravated burglary, and that he'd had a long history of drug use.\n\n\"I haven't had good experiences with police,\" Rogers told the paper, adding that his move to help on Friday was a \"spur of the moment\" decision.\n\nSomali-born Australian Hassain Khalif Shire Ali, 30, stabbed three men on the street in Friday's attack, killing a well-known restaurateur and wounding two other men.\n\nWell-known cafe owner Sisto Malaspina, 74, died a short distance from the popular Pellegrini's Espresso Bar he had run for more than 40 years. In a mark of his community renown, Malaspina will be given a state funeral next week. The other two men are recovering in a hospital from non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nVictoria state Police Commissioner Graham Ashton said Shire Ali had also made an \"unsophisticated\" plan for his vehicle to explode to cause many more fatalities. He had placed several barbecue gas canisters in his pickup, but they failed to ignite.\n\nShire Ali was known to federal police and his Australian passport was canceled in 2015 out of concern that he planned to travel to Syria to fight with the Islamic State group.\n\nWhile Rogers won praise from the community, senior Victorian police officials were divided in their reaction.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Shane Patton said Rogers' help was appreciated by police on the scene. \"There's no doubt he acted bravely,\" he told ABC radio. \"His assistance was greatly appreciated.\"\n\nBut later, Patton's superior, Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton, said that Rogers' actions could have led to a tragic outcome.\n\n\"I don't like to criticize people in that situation, he's acting instinctively about what he's looking at in front of him,\" Ashton told Melbourne radio 3AW. \"But certainly if a trolley had hit a police member and knocked him over and then this offender was on top of him, it could have had a tragic consequence. Luckily in this case, it didn't.\"\n\nVictorian Premier Daniel Andrews confirmed Monday that Malaspina would be honored with a state funeral, and that renaming a laneway near his cafe after him was also under consideration.\n\n\"Sisto Malaspina was a Victorian icon, known and loved by us all,\" Andrews tweeted. \"I spoke to his family again this morning, and they have accepted my offer of a state funeral next week, with more details to come.\"", "A look at recent developments in the South China Sea, where China is pitted against smaller neighbors in multiple disputes over islands, coral reefs and lagoons in waters crucial for global commerce and rich in fish and potential oil and gas reserves:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This is a weekly look at the latest developments in the South China Sea, the location of several territorial conflicts that have raised tensions in the region.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nCHINA DEMANDS END TO US OPERATIONS\n\nChina has demanded the United States stop sending ships and military aircraft close to its South China Sea island claims during talks to prepare for a meeting between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping.\n\nThe U.S. pushed back Friday, insisting it will continue to \"fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows.\" In late September, U.S. and Chinese vessels nearly collided close to a disputed reef.\n\nTensions have also flared amid a bitter trade dispute that Trump and Xi are expected to tackle at the Group of 20 summit in Argentina later this month.\n\nThe talks were scheduled to be held in Beijing last month but were postponed after Washington announced new arms sales to Taiwan, and after a Chinese destroyer came close to the USS Decatur in late September in what the U.S. Navy called an \"unsafe and unprofessional maneuver.\"\n\n\"The Chinese side made it clear to the United States that it should stop sending its vessels and military aircraft close to Chinese islands and reefs and stop actions that undermine Chinese authority and security interests,\" said Chinese senior foreign policy adviser, Yang Jiechi, who also had sharp words over U.S. support for Taiwan.\n\nHowever, Yang and Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe also spoke of the need to improve cooperation, including between the U.S. and Chinese militaries, to ease the risk of conflict as the two powers jockey for pre-eminence in the Asia-Pacific.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nVIETNAM PROTESTS CHINESE WEATHER STATIONS\n\nVietnam has protested China's launch of weather stations in the disputed Spratly islands, saying they violate Vietnam's sovereignty and complicate the situation in the South China Sea.\n\nChina last week announced it started operations of the stations on three islands to offer weather forecasts to fishermen in the South China Sea region, neighboring countries and passing ships.\n\nVietnamese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang told reporters at a regularly scheduled briefing Thursday that Vietnam has the legal basis and historical evidence to assert its sovereignty over the Spratlys and Paracels and asked China to stop the action.\n\nThe Chinese stations are built on man-made islands constructed atop coral reefs that also have airstrips, radar stations and other military features.\n\n\"The fact that China started use of meteorological observation stations on the illegally built structures in the Spratlys has seriously violated Vietnam's sovereignty over the islands,\" she said.\n\n\"Vietnam persistently opposes this act and asks China to immediately stop the above-said actions,\" she said.\n\nHang said China should abide by the principles reached between the two countries guiding the settlement of the maritime issues and the Declaration of the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea \"without complicating the situation, affecting peace, security and stability\" in the South China Sea.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nCHINESE SHIP GREETS JAPANESE VESSEL\n\nDespite Beijing's strenuous objections to \"outside parties\" becoming involved in the South China Sea, a Chinese warship sent friendly greetings to a Japanese navy vessel as part of an overall improvement in relations between the regional rivals.\n\nJapanese state broadcaster NHK reported last week that the message was sent in later October from the Chinese destroyer Lanzhou to the Japanese helicopter carrier Kaga.\n\n\"Good morning, glad to see you,\" NHK quoted the Chinese message as saying.\n\nChina frequently evokes memories of Japan's brutal World War II invasion and occupation of much of its territory to warn of what it calls the threat of resurgent Japanese militarism. China is also a strong critic of the U.S.-Japanese defense alliance and opposes all actions by their two militaries seen as challenging its claim to almost the entire South China Sea.\n\nHowever, trade friction with the U.S. appears to be drawing the two closer, with Chinese President Xi Jinping telling Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last month that the two countries are \"sharing more common interests and concerns.\"\n\nChina-Japan relations have undergone turbulence but are now \"back to a normal track,\" Xi told Abe during the first formal visit to Beijing by a Japanese leader in nearly seven years.\n\nAbe's visit highlights the improvement in ties after they hit a low in 2012 during a dispute over East China Sea islands controlled by Japan but claimed by China.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Mathew Pennington in Washington and Tran Van Minh in Hanoi, Vietnam contributed to this report.", "The Latest on the arrest in Australian strawberry sabotage cases (all times local):\n\n2:30 p.m.\n\nAn Australian magistrate says she won't consider bail for a woman accused of putting needles in strawberries until her motive for sabotaging the fruit becomes clearer.\n\nMagistrate Christine Roney said in court Monday that prosecutors were alleging former strawberry farm worker My Ut Trinh was \"motivated by spite or revenge\" over a workplace grievance.\n\nThe recalls of the fruit prompted by the first cases of the sabotage in September devastated Australia's strawberry industry.\n\nTrinh was arrested Sunday and has been charged with seven counts of contamination of goods with intent to cause economic loss, and faces up to 10 years in jail in if convicted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n11 a.m.\n\nPolice have made their first arrest in the cases of strawberry sabotage in Australia, in which sewing needles were found in fruit sold in six states.\n\nPolice in Queensland state say they've arrested 50-year-old My Ut Trinh and charged her with seven counts of goods contamination.\n\nDetective John Walker of the State Crime Command said she worked in the strawberry industry near the town of Caboolture, north of Brisbane.\n\nShe was due to appear in court Monday.

The truth is more complicated than that, and one could argue the views of the Democratic Party are hurting progressive issues - most especially in red and purple jurisdictions.\n\nFor the past decade or so, many voters pick a color jersey to wear, and then decide their issue stances. The issue positions come in the aftermath of many folks deciding they are a Republican or Democrat. This party identification has much more to do with culture or place than it has to do with ideology. And if one divorces party from policy, the progressive policies across America are much more popular than is characterized by the media and in our political discourse.\n\nFor example, in examining recent polling, a large majority of Americans (70 percent) support Medicare-for-all, otherwise known as single-payer health care, that includes 85 percent of Democrats and a majority of both Independents and Republicans. Medicare for all is much more popular than President Trump, and is more popular than either political party.\n\nThe election results showed that when you put progressive policies directly on the ballot, they do exceedingly well at the polls including in deeply red states. In deep red Utah, Idaho and Nebraska, expanded Medicaid pasted comfortably as ballot initiatives. Further, in red Missouri and Arkansas, ballot initiatives raising the minimum wage passed overwhelmingly at the polls, even while opposed by most Republican leaders. In Florida, giving felons the right to vote carried in a landslide though many Republican officials campaigned against it. And in Washington state, restrictions on gun purchases and enhanced background checks received more votes than any candidate running for office.\n\nWhat does this all mean?\n\nWhen voters across America are given a chance to vote directly on many progressive issues, and when not linked to a particular political party, they give broad support to these policies. Not only can certain progressive issues do well in blue and purple states, but they can succeed in red states when they are not dragged down in many voters\u2019 minds by linkage to party identification. It means that ideology is not driving most voters choices - and if leaders can separate key issues from party identification, they can achieve success.\n\nProgressives might recognize a couple of things from these latest results at the polls.\n\n1. The power of the NRA is a myth when it comes to general elections. Yes, they have power in GOP primaries, but when it comes to the diverse electorate of a general election, they are very likely to lose. This shows up in nearly every poll where most of America wants common sense gun reform, and the results last Tuesday showed this.\n\n2. Democrats might be better off just laying out some popular progressive issues to accomplish and define those issues not as party positions, but as advances forward for voters, separate from making voters commit to being a Democrat.\n\n3. Progressives who want to accomplish policy change might achieve much greater success pushing forward ballot initiatives in red and purple states, and not get too bogged down in convincing GOP legislators to support their positions. They would have a much easier time getting voters to commit to certain positions, like increases in minimum wage or gun reform, than in going through state legislatures which may block them at every turn because of party politics.\n\nIn the 21st century American political environment, culture is way more important than ideology, and on certain progressive issues Republican leaders and right-wing media is way out of step with red state voters. In the midterm just held, we see from ballot initiatives, not only will Democrats support some progressive positions, but many Independents and a sizable group of Republicans will as well.\n\nThe main problem Democrats have in winning races in red states or districts is not an issue of positions or ideology, it is that many of those voters don\u2019t feel they are culturally aligned, and that the Democratic Party carries a negative brand which drags down movement forward on progressive policy.\n\nIt is a new world, and success can more readily be achieved by understanding that voters care much more about cultural alignment than they do about ideological alignment.\n\nMatthew Dowd is an ABC News analyst and special correspondent.

They encouraged us to understand the context,\" she said. \"You could speak your mind, but you had to be respectful, you know? And if you got outta hand, you got a look. You'd get a spanking... they weren't free wheeling parents. They were still black parents. But they believed in teaching us to think for ourselves.\"\n\nAt her alma mater, Whitney M. Young High School on Chicago's West Side, she said, she was encouraged to work hard and to excel. In 1981, she entered Princeton as a freshman and had to \"learn how to adjust to this new world.\"\n\n\"It was the first time I had been in a predominantly white situation,\" Obama said. \"So I had to learn how to adjust in this new world of wealth and privilege and kids that I didn't realize had come from prep schools that had prepared them. And I didn't even know the language of that college. What was a syllabus? Never heard of it.\n\nMichelle Obama on marriage counseling, past fertility struggles\n\nShe was working at a Chicago law firm when she was asked to mentor Barack Obama, two years her senior and rumored to be an exceptionally gifted law student at Harvard. Initially she considered him off-limits, but later found herself drawn to him.\n\nCourtesy of the Obama-Robinson Family Archives\n\nEventually, her resolve to avoid romance with one of the firm's few black summer associates began to falter.\n\n\"He was like, 'You're crazy. We should date. I like you. You like me,'\" she said. \"I like that about him. He was very straightforward.\"\n\nWhile their mutual affection has always been on display, Michelle Obama, for the first time, opened up in her book and to Roberts about the aspects of their marriage.\n\nIn her book, she discusses suffering a miscarriage and the infertility treatments that helped her conceive daughters Malia and Sasha.\n\n\"The biological clock is real because egg production is limited,\" she said. \"I realized that as I was 34 and 35. We had to do IVF [in-vitro fertilization]. I think it's the worst thing that we do to each other as women, not share the truth about our bodies and how they work and how they don't work.\"\n\nShe also shared details of how the stress of their hectic schedules infiltrated their marriage.\n\nCourtesy of the Obama-Robinson Family Archives\n\n\"Marriage counseling for us was one of those ways where we learned how to talk out our differences. What I learned about myself was that my happiness was up to me. And I started working out more. I started asking for help, not just from him, but from other people. I stopped feeling guilty,\" she said. \"I know too many young couples who struggle and think that somehow there's something wrong with them. And I want them to know that Michelle and Barack Obama, who have a phenomenal marriage and who love each other, we work on our marriage. And we get help with our marriage when we need it.\"\n\nThe campaign trail tested Michelle Obama's self-esteem\n\nAt times, she feared that she was a deficit to her husband as he campaigned to become the next U.S. president.\n\n\"I write about those, you know, those nasty times where people, you know-- called me Barack's 'baby mama,' you know? Accused me of not loving my country. You know, told me I was angry,\" she said.\n\nDuring the campaign, she said she did not pay attention to the criticism. In her book, she admitted the comments had hurt.\n\n\"I don't think we do each other a service by pretending like hurtful things don't hurt. And that's what I've come to,\" she said.\n\nCallie Shell/Aurora Photos\n\nFor Michelle Obama, the hurt continued into the White House as critics, including Donald Trump, questioned the legitimacy of her husband's birth certificate.\n\n\"The whole thing was crazy and mean-spirited. Of course, it\u2019s underlying bigotry and xenophobia hardly concealed,\" she said in her book.\n\nBut she had work to do and she paved her own path with initiatives like Let's Move, Joining Forces and Let Girls Learn.\n\nHow Michelle Obama reacted to Donald Trump winning the presidency\n\nIn the wake of the 2016 election, Michelle Obama said she was surprised that people still had to be told how important it is to vote.\n\nChuck Kennedy for ABC\n\n\"I said what I continue to say: Being the commander-in-chief is a hard job. And you need to have discipline and you need to read and you need to be knowledgeable. You need to know history. You need to be careful with your words. But voters make those decisions. And once the voters have spoken, you know, we live with what we live with,\" she said.\n\nAfter Donald Trump was elected president, Obama wrote in her book about coming to terms with the new reality before her, writing, \"I will always wonder about what led so many, women in particular, to reject an exceptionally qualified female candidate and instead choose a misogynist as their president.\"\n\nObama also wrote about her thoughts as she watched Trump's inauguration ceremony on Jan. 20, 2017, writing, \"The vibrant diversity of the two previous inaugurations was gone... Someone from Barack\u2019s administration might have said that the optics there were bad -- that what the public saw didn\u2019t reflect the president\u2019s reality or ideals. But in this case, maybe it did. Realizing it, I made my own optic adjustment: I stopped even trying to smile.\"\n\n\"I implored people to focus and to think about what it takes to be commander in chief,\" Obama told Roberts. \"It's amazing to me that we still have to tell people about the importance of voting. You know, that almost every two years, we're having this conversation to get people to the polls. And in the end, that's how our democracy works.\"\n\nMichelle Obama used music to bring diversity, youth into the White House\n\nMichelle Obama, who taught herself how to play the piano, said she grew up in a household of music.\n\n\"Music was important and it still is,\" she said. \"It really set me on a course.\"\n\nIn 2012, she created special state dinners designed just for children.\n\n\"Whether it was a music event, or whether it was the state dinner, during that earlier part of the day we'd have a companion event with young kids from around the country,\" she said. \"They could eat the food as well and meet the entertainers.\"\n\nViking\n\nThis cultural event at the White Hose involved spoken word, she said. And it was at that event that she and President Barack Obama met playwright and composer Lin Manuel Miranda.\n\n\"He had this bright idea. He said he was gonna perform a piece on Alexander Hamilton,\" she said. \"Barack and I almost laughed in his face. And he went out and performed the first number of the now-award-winning musical and afterwards he said, 'I think I'm gonna go and turn this into a Broadway show.'\" ... We were like 'Good luck with that, kid.'\"", "South Korea has airlifted 200 tons of tangerines to North Korea in return for shipments of pine mushrooms by the North in September, officials said Monday.\n\nSouth Korean military planes flew to Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, on Sunday and Monday to deliver the fruit from the southern island of Jeju, according to Seoul's Defense Ministry. The airlifts are another sign that liberal South Korean President Moon Jae-in is moving ahead with efforts to improve ties with North Korea despite stalemated global diplomacy on the North's nuclear program.\n\nAfter a summit meeting between the Koreas in Pyongyang in September, North Korea gave South Korea 2 tons of pine mushrooms as a goodwill gesture. Pine mushrooms are white and brown fungi that are considered a healthy delicacy in both Koreas and other Asian countries. They are one of the North's most prized regional products, and the country shipped them to South Korea in 2000 and 2007 after previous summit talks.\n\nAfter their summit, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un also gave Moon a gift of two dogs, both white Pungsans. On Monday, Moon tweeted that one of the dogs, named Gomi, gave birth to six healthy puppies last Friday.\n\n\"Six dogs were added to a gift of two dogs. I cannot help saying it's a big fortune and I hope that South-North ties will be like this,\" Moon said.\n\nPungsan is a dog breed native to North Korea and is best known for its loyalty and bravery during hunting. North Korea sent a pair of Pungsans to South Korea after the 2000 summit, and South Korea gave two indigenous Jindo dogs to the North.\n\nDespite warming ties between the Koreas, there have been no major recent breakthroughs in U.S.-led diplomacy aimed at stripping North Korea of its nuclear program.\n\nAccording to officials in Seoul and Washington, North Korea recently postponed high-level talks with the United States on the North's disarmament and on setting up a second summit between President Donald Trump and Kim.\n\nAfter a provocative series of nuclear and missile tests last year, North Korea entered talks with the United States and South Korea this year, saying it's willing to deal away its growing nuclear weapons arsenal. The North has since taken measures such as dismantling its nuclear test site and parts of its rocket-engine testing facility, but U.S. officials want it to take more significant, irreversible steps toward denuclearization.\n\nMoon, who has met Kim three times this year, believes that better ties between the Koreas will help resolve the nuclear issue.\n\nSouth Korea's Unification Ministry said Monday it has approved a visit by seven North Koreans to attend an academic forum in the South later this week. The forum is on regional issues, including Japan's wartime mobilization of laborers in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nSeoul said Saturday that the two Koreas have finished withdrawing troops and firearms from some of their front-line guard posts as part of their agreements to lower military tensions. The Koreas have also halted military exercises along their border and have been clearing mines from a border area to conduct their first-ever joint searches for Korean War dead.", "bad url", "More than 20 years after his father almost bargained them away for a pair of nuclear reactors, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has his nuclear weapons \u2014 and a nation still plagued by chronic blackouts.\n\nEven on the clearest days, plumes of smoke from two towering chimneys linger over the center of Pyongyang. The Soviet-era Pyongyang Combined Heat and Power Plant smokestacks are one of the North Korean capital's most recognizable landmarks.\n\nPossibly more than anything else, this is Kim Jong Un's Achilles heel as he turns his attention from developing the country's nuclear weapons arsenal to building its economy.\n\nIf stalled nuclear talks with Washington ever get back on track, helping Kim solve his country's chronic energy deficit could be one of the biggest carrots President Trump has to offer. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo tried that back in the 1990s, and were even ready to pay for and build those two reactors Kim's father wanted.\n\nYears of intensive sanctions have severely impacted North Korea's supply of fossil fuels from the outside world, but they also have spurred the country to cobble together a smorgasbord of energy resources, some of them off the grid and some of them flat-out illegal.\n\nHere's a look at where Kim stands and what he is doing to win his country's real struggle for power.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTHE BIG PICTURE\n\nAmong the most iconic images of North Korea are nighttime satellite photos that reveal it as an inky abyss ringed by the bright lights of China, South Korea and Japan.\n\nThe whole nation of 25 million people uses about the same amount of electricity each year as Washington alone. It uses as much crude oil in a year as the U.S. consumes in just 12 hours. South Korea has about twice the population of the North, but its electricity consumption in 2014 was about 40 times bigger.\n\nHydroelectricity, which is subject to seasonal swings, provides about half of the fuel supplied to the national energy grid. Coal accounts for the other half.\n\nThe grid is leaky, archaic and badly needing repairs.\n\nThat smoke-spewing power plant in the capital, which supplies much of the power and hot water needs for central Pyongyang, dates to the 1960s. Lights in the huge concrete apartment blocks of Tongil Boulevard across town stay lit thanks largely to the East Pyongyang Thermal Power Station \u2014 built by the Soviet Union in the 1980s.\n\nWhat electricity there is is unevenly distributed.\n\nThe showcase capital and cities near coal or hydroelectric power plants get the best coverage. Military facilities also take precedence and often have their own supply. So do important party and government operations, some of the higher-profile residences and hotels in the capital and even some restaurants. Lights used to illuminate portraits of the leaders at night never go out.\n\nStill, it's not uncommon for the power even in many higher status locations to flicker on and off. Dancing beams of flashlights are commonplace on the streets or in otherwise darkened apartments. In rural villages, even that often fades to black.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKEEPING THE OIL FLOWING ...\n\nNorth Korea must import about 3 million to 4 million barrels of crude oil each year to sustain its economy.\n\nMost of it flows through one pipeline.\n\nThe China-North Korea \"Friendship Oil Pipeline\" runs from the border city of Dandong under the Yalu River to a storage facility on the North Korean side about 13 kilometers (10 miles) outside the city of Sinuiju. From there, some is sent across country by truck or rail to the east coast, where it is stored at the port of Munchon. More is transported to Pyongyang for priority recipients such as the military, government departments and state enterprises, and to the port of Nampo, southwest of Pyongyang.\n\nThe pipeline \u2014technically there are two, one for crude and the other for refined products \u2014 was built between 1974 and 1976.\n\nNorth Korea used to have two refineries. The pipeline from China terminates at the Ponghwa Chemical Factory, which produces gasoline and diesel. The other refinery was built by the Soviet Union in the north near the Rason Special Economic Zone in the 1970s. It shut down in 1995 with the collapse of the Soviet empire. The pipeline that connected it with Siberia has long been out of use.\n\nUnder U.N. sanctions imposed late last year, North Korea can import a maximum 500,000 barrels of refined oil products along with 4 million barrels of crude oil per year.\n\nAlong with its Chinese connection, the North has been supplied by Russian tankers that ship oil and petroleum products to Munchon and another east coast port, Hungnam. It has found willing suppliers in the Middle East, or on the open market.\n\nSince the imposition of the import cap, Pyongyang has been implicated in increasingly sophisticated schemes to augment its supplies with hard-to-track transfers of oil by tankers at sea.\n\nWashington's ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, told the Security Council in September the United States tracked at least 148 instances of oil tankers delivering refined petroleum products obtained through illegal ship-to-ship transfers in the first eight months of this year. She claimed the amount of illegally transferred oil \u2014 about 800,000 barrels \u2014 was 160 percent of the annual 500,000 barrel cap.\n\n\"In reality, we think they have obtained four times the annual quota in the first eight months of this year,\" Haley said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n... AND GOING OFF THE GRID\n\nDavid von Hippel and Peter Hayes of the Nautilus Institute have been following North Korea's energy issue for years.\n\nComparing Chinese trade figures from 2000 through 2017, they found explosive growth in North Korea's imports of passenger cars and trucks that put an additional 107,000 vehicles on its roads. Tractor sales also rose and sales of \"electricity propelled\" bicycles or scooters, a category that wasn't even listed until last year, doubled to 128,000.\n\nThe truck and tractor sales almost certainly reflect an upgrade to the North's transportation and agricultural sectors. Being able to get around is a key to doing business in a market-centric economy, and so is having enough spending power to buy things like electric scooters.\n\nMoreover, in a study released this month, Hayes and von Hippel also found that imports of diesel- and gasoline-powered generators, coupled with solar panels that are already ubiquitous in the North, are creating an energy system increasingly independent of the national power grid.\n\n\"The data ... reinforces a picture of a DPRK in which a more vibrant, modernizing, increasingly (at least functionally) market-based economy is providing households, business and institutions with the wherewithal to invest in both off-grid electricity supplies and increased transport services,\" they wrote, using the acronym for the North's official name.\n\nStill, keeping the power on often can be an elaborate routine.\n\nSolar panels, the cheapest option, can keep a room lit, a mobile phone working and maybe a TV or another appliance going. When electricity from the grid is actually flowing, it can be used to charge batteries before the next blackout hits.\n\nThose with a little more clout or money use diesel- or gas-powered generators that can power anything from a restaurant to an apartment block.\n\nOr a military installation.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTalmadge is the AP's Pyongyang bureau chief.

In an interview with The Associated Press, she said Long was a \"ticking time bomb\" who constantly lost his temper, threw tantrums and would scream at coaches when he didn't like their decisions. She said she once witnessed him assault a fellow coach.\n\nThat coach, Dominique Colell, said Long grabbed her rear and midsection after she refused to return a cellphone. Another time, he used his hand to mimic shooting her, Colell said, adding that she feared for herself whenever she was around him.\n\nCluke said she also witnessed Long pretending to shoot Colell.\n\n\"When Dominique turned around and saw that, she turned pale as a ghost and it was very, very scary.\" Cluke said. \"Just sadistic. ... He was out of control. He would scream and cuss and his face would turn bright red and people would actually back away from him.\"\n\nLong, a 28-year-old former Marine machine-gunner who served in Afghanistan, opened fire during college night at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks on Wednesday night. He killed 11 people and a police officer who responded, and then fatally shot himself, police said.\n\nAuthorities have not determined a motive.\n\nColell kicked Long off the track team immediately after he assaulted her, but she and Cluke said the boy's track coach urged her to reconsider because that could compromise Long's goal of joining the Marines. The head track coach, Cluke said, reversed Colell's decision to throw Long off the team and told her she didn't have that authority, while the now-retired principal brushed it aside as a one-time incident.\n\nLong rejoined the team after apologizing in front of several coaches and administrators.\n\nCluke said she, Colell and her father, also a track coach at the school at the time, repeatedly reported Long's behavioral problems, to no avail.\n\n\"You need to do something about this kid. He needs some help.\" Cluke said she told administrators. \"And they're like, 'Well, he's got a good heart he'll be fine. Just talk to him.'\"\n\nEmails to various administrators at the high school were not immediately answered Sunday. Attempts to get comment by phone and in person from officials at the school and its district were unsuccessful Friday, when both were closed because of a massive and deadly wildfire in the area.\n\nCluke recalled a time when she and her father sat down with Long for a talk and asked him why he wanted to join the military. His answer, she said, \"is burned in my soul.\"\n\n\"He said he wanted to be in the Marines because he wanted to go fight in the war for our country and he wanted to kill for our country,\" she said. \"When you hear somebody say they want to be in the military because they want to kill people in the name of our country, that's chilling. It chilled me right down to my bones.\"\n\nShe said it's time for school administrators across the country to take behavioral problems seriously.\n\n\"It's not the military or video games or music that causes this,\" she said. \"It's the inaction of people in authority.\"\n\nShe said that if other coaches and school administrators had acted following complaints about Long, \"he could've gotten help and 12 innocent people wouldn't be dead now.\"\n\n\"The warning signs were there,\" she said.", "In a story Nov. 11 about (topic), The Associated Press reported erroneously the location of the headquarters for Qualtrics.

Follow Emily Wagster Pettus on Twitter: http://twitter.com/EWagsterPettus .", "This story is from Kaiser Health News\n\nA widely anticipated study has concluded that neither vitamin D nor fish oil supplements prevent cancer or serious heart-related problems in healthy older people, according to research presented Saturday at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions. Researchers defined serious heart problems as the combined rate of heart attacks, stroke and heart-related deaths.\n\nAlthough hundreds of studies of these supplements have been published over the years, the new clinical trial \u2014 a federally funded project involving nearly 26,000 people \u2014 is the strongest and most definitive examination yet, said Dr. Clifford Rosen, a senior scientist at the Maine Medical Center Research Institute who was not involved in the research.\n\nDoctors have been keenly interested in learning the supplements\u2019 true value, given their tremendous popularity with patients. A 2017 study found that 26 percent of Americans age 60 and older take vitamin D supplements, while 22 percent take pills containing omega-3 fatty acids, a key ingredient in fish oil.\n\nThe new study also suggests there\u2019s no reason for people to undergo routine blood tests for vitamin D, said Rosen, who co-wrote an accompanying editorial. (Both were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.). That\u2019s because the study found that patients\u2019 vitamin D levels made no difference in their risk of cancer or serious heart issues, Rosen said. Even people who began the study with clear vitamin D deficiency got no benefit from taking the supplements, which provided 2,000 international units a day. This amount is equal to one or two of the vitamin D pills typically sold in stores.\n\nA recent Kaiser Health News story reported that vitamin D testing has become a huge business for commercial labs \u2014 and an enormous expense for taxpayers. Doctors ordered more than 10 million vitamin D tests for Medicare patients in 2016 \u2014 an increase of 547 percent since 2007 \u2014 at a cost of $365 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to stop it,\u201d said Rosen of vitamin D testing. \u201cThere\u2019s no justification.\u201d\n\nDr. JoAnn Manson, the study\u2019s lead author, agrees that her results don\u2019t support screening healthy people for vitamin D deficiency.\n\nBut she doesn\u2019t see her study as entirely negative.\n\nManson notes that her team found no serious side effects from taking either fish oil or vitamin D supplements.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re already taking fish oil or vitamin D, our results would not provide a clear reason to stop,\u201d Manson said.\n\nManson notes that a deeper look into the data suggested possible benefits.\n\nWhen researchers singled out heart attacks \u2014 rather than the rate of all serious heart problems combined \u2014 they saw that fish oil appeared to reduce heart attacks by 28 percent, Manson said. As for vitamin D, it appeared to reduce cancer deaths \u2014 although not cancer diagnoses \u2014 by 25 percent.\n\nBut slicing the data into smaller segments \u2014 with fewer patients in each group \u2014 can produce unreliable results, said Dr. Barnett Kramer, director of the cancer prevention division at the National Cancer Institute. The links between fish oil and heart attacks \u2014 and vitamin D and cancer death \u2014 could be due to chance, Kramer said.\n\nExperts agree that vitamin D is important for bone health. Researchers didn\u2019t report on its effect on bones in these papers, however. Instead, they looked at areas where vitamin D\u2019s benefits haven\u2019t been definitely proven, such as cancer and heart disease. Although preliminary studies have suggested vitamin D can prevent heart disease and cancer, more rigorous studies have disputed those findings.\n\nManson and her colleagues plan to publish data on the supplements\u2019 effects on other areas of health in coming months, including diabetes, memory and mental functioning, autoimmune disease, respiratory infections and depression.\n\nConsumers who want to reduce their risk of cancer and heart disease can follow other proven strategies.\n\n\u201cPeople should continue to focus on known factors to reduce cancer and heart disease: Eat right, exercise, don\u2019t smoke, control high blood pressure, take a statin if you are high risk,\u201d said Dr. Alex Krist, a professor of family medicine and population health at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

MillerCoors, meanwhile, says it's not obligated to continue brewing for Pabst and that Pabst doesn't want to pay enough to justify doing so.\n\nThe trial in Milwaukee County Circuit Court begins Monday and is scheduled through Nov. 30.\n\nPabst's attorneys have said in court documents and hearings that MillerCoors LLC is lying about its brewing capacity to break away from Pabst and capture its share of the cheap beer market by disrupting Pabst's ability to compete. At a March hearing in which MillerCoors tried to have the lawsuit dismissed, Pabst attorney Adam Paris said \"stunning documents\" obtained from MillerCoors show that it went as far as hiring a consultant to \"figure out ways to get rid of us.\" MillerCoors has called that a mischaracterization of the consultant's work.\n\nThe 1999 agreement between MillerCoors and Pabst, which was founded in Milwaukee in 1844 but is now headquartered in Los Angeles, expires in 2020 but provides for two possible five-year extensions. The companies dispute how the extensions should be negotiated: MillerCoors argues that it has sole discretion to determine whether it can continue brewing for Pabst, whereas Pabst says the companies must work \"in good faith\" to find a solution if Pabst wants to extend the agreement but MillerCoors lacks the capacity.\n\nPabst needs 4 million to 4.5 million barrels brewed annually and claims MillerCoors is its only option. It is seeking more than $400 million in damages and for MillerCoors to be ordered to honor its contract.\n\nDuring 2015 negotiations about extending the contract, MillerCoors announced it would close its brewing facility in Eden, North Carolina, and that it eventually might have to shutter another facility in Irwindale, California. Pabst contends that MillerCoors refused to provide any information to substantiate its claim that it would no longer have the capacity to continue brewing Pabst's beers, and that it wouldn't consider leasing the Eden facility and would only sell it for an \"astronomical\" price.\n\nPabst says MillerCoors wouldn't agree to an extension unless Pabst paid $45 per barrel \u2014 \"a commercially devastating, near-triple price increase\" from what it pays now. At the March hearing, Paris said MillerCoors knew Pabst couldn't accept that proposal \"because it would have bankrupted us three times over.\"\n\nIn court filings, MillersCoors said Pabst's proposals to keep the Eden facility open \"were commercially unreasonable\" and that Pabst sought \"a windfall through litigation\" instead of offering to pay enough to keep a facility open. It also said the facility's closing was \"to ensure the longer-term sustainability\" of MillerCoors because thousands of new brewers have entered the market over the past decade.\n\nMillerCoors and Anheuser-Busch, which have the biggest U.S. market share at 24.8 percent and 41.6 percent, respectively, have been losing business to smaller independent brewers, imports, and wine and spirits in recent years, according to the Brewers Association.\n\n\"The beer market has shifted and beer lovers are increasingly demanding more variety, fuller-flavor, and local products from small and independent producers,\" said Bart Watson, the Brewers Association's chief economist.\n\nOverall U.S. beer sales have declined, with shipments down from 213.1 million barrels in 2008 to 204.2 million in 2017, according to the Brewers Association.\n\nPabst depends on MillerCoors because the only other U.S. brewer with capacity to make its products is Anheuser-Busch, which doesn't do contract brewing, Paris said.\n\n\"It really is an existential issue for Pabst because it has no real alternatives,\" Paris said at the March hearing.\n\nParis said the report from the consultant MillerCoors hired in 2013 proves the company never intended to act in good faith. Pabst's attorneys say the report had sections focused on how to \"eliminate Pabst altogether\" and noted that MillerCoors would need to close two breweries \"to be sure they don't have excess capacity for contract manufacturing.\"\n\nMillerCoors' attorney, Eric Van Vugt, said in court that the company didn't rely on the consultant's report when it decided to close Eden or when it has contemplated closing the Irwindale brewery.\n\n\"If we keep Irwindale open, yes, we can supply their beer,\" Van Vugt said. \"No one disputes that.

However, soon afterward she dashed out onto the Champs-Elysees in front of Trump's motorcade, shouting \"fake peace maker.\"\n\nAt that point, she was detained along with two other Femen protesters in the crowds of onlookers along the Champs-Elysees. All three had \"fake peace makers\" scrawled across their breasts, according to Inna Shevchenko, one of Femen's leaders.\n\nThe three are facing charges of sexual exhibitionism, a judicial official said.\n\nShevchenko would not comment on the fake photographer ploy.

So Congress has to act,\" Schumer told CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\n\"We Democrats, House and Senate, will attempt to add to must-pass legislation, in this case the spending bill, legislation that would prevent Mr. Whitaker from interfering with the Mueller investigation.\"\n\nSchumer sent a letter to the Justice Department on Sunday along with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats that calls for Lee Lofthus, an assistant attorney general and the department's chief ethics officer, to disclose whether he had advised Whitaker to recuse himself from oversight of the probe. The Democrats cited Whitaker's past public statements, which have included an op-ed article in which he said Mueller would be straying outside his mandate if he investigated President Donald Trump's family finances and a talk radio interview in which he maintained there was no evidence of collusion between the Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.\n\nThe letter asked Lofthus to explain his reasoning for any recommendation he made to Whitaker regarding recusal and to provide all ethics guidance provided to the acting attorney general.\n\nWhitaker, a Republican Party loyalist and chief of staff to just-ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was elevated Wednesday after Trump forced Sessions out.\n\nWhitaker has faced pressure from Democrats to recuse himself from overseeing Mueller based on the comments, which were made before he joined the Justice Department last year. He has also tweeted an ex-prosecutor's opinion piece that described a \"Mueller lynch mob,\" which he said was \"worth a read.\"\n\nThe Mueller protection bill would give any special counsel a 10-day window to seek review of a firing and ensure that the person was fired for good cause.\n\nIt's unclear if Republicans would agree to add the bill to the spending legislation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said there is no need for it, but other Republicans, like Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and Maine Sen. Susan Collins, have called for the bill since Whitaker was appointed.\n\nSchumer declined to say whether Democrats would be willing to force a government shutdown if Congress did not pass a measure protecting Mueller, suggesting it wouldn't come to that because of bipartisan support. \"There's no reason we shouldn't add this and avoid a constitutional crisis,\" he said. \"If that doesn't happen, we will see what happens down the road.\"\n\nThe bipartisan Mueller legislation was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in April and was co-sponsored by Republican Sens.

But unresolved races for governor in Georgia and Florida are raising major strategic questions for Democrats as they turn their attention to the upcoming battle for the White House.\n\nAs in other states, Democrats in Florida and Georgia drew record turnout in last week's election. The coalition of suburban women, young people and minorities delivered the House to Democrats for the first time in nearly a decade.\n\nBut it wasn't enough to score decisive victories in the closely watched races for governor in Georgia and Florida, where fresh-faced African-American Democratic candidates for governor trailed their older, white Republican competitors. In Georgia, Stacey Abrams hasn't conceded her race while Andrew Gillum's contest in Florida is undergoing a recount.\n\nFor some Democrats, the lesson emerging from the 2018 midterms is that massive turnout can win suburban House races across New Jersey, Pennsylvania and California. But the coalition that produced some success elsewhere may not be enough in Florida, the nation's premier presidential battleground state, and Georgia, a state Democrats view with increasing optimism.\n\n\"It's not a viable long-term plan to constantly rely on record turnout,\" said Democratic strategist Steve Schale, who led former President Barack Obama's efforts in Florida. \"We have a national issue we have to deal with.\"\n\nWhile Gillum and Abrams have much in common, they ran on different messages.\n\nGillum, the 39-year-old mayor of Florida's capital city, ran as an unapologetic member of the Trump resistance. He openly called for President Donald Trump's impeachment. And he accused his Republican opponent, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, of blatant racism.\n\nAbrams, the 44-year-old minority leader in Georgia's House of Representative, highlighted her bipartisan credentials throughout her bid for governor. While she and Gillum embraced liberal policy priorities, such as \"Medicare for All,\" she promoted her work with Republicans in the state legislature, even highlighting a handshake with GOP Gov. Nathan Deal in a campaign ad.\n\nStill, both were viewed as rising stars within the evolving Democratic Party, a new generation of Democratic leadership that could expand the party's appeal among all voters.\n\nRacial divisions appear to have limited their appeal, however.\n\nBoth Gillum and Abrams won African-Americans and young voters by overwhelming margins. But they struggled with older, white voters, particularly noncollege-educated white voters, who make up the core of Trump's political base.\n\nGillum won 92 percent of black voters, according to VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the electorate conducted by The Associated Press. He also won 60 percent of voters 18 to 29 years old, and 54 percent of women.\n\nBut Gillum earned just 44 percent of the male vote. And he won only 39 percent of the overall white vote \u2014 and 35 percent among noncollege-educated white voters.\n\nIt was worse for Abrams, who was poised to become the nation's first African-American female governor.\n\nShe won 94 percent of Georgia's black vote, but just 25 percent of white voters. She carried 56 percent of women, but just 40 percent of men. A dismal 19 percent of noncollege-educated white men supported her, according to VoteCast.\n\nNationwide, 43 percent of white voters backed Democrats, including 38 percent of noncollege-educated whites.\n\nThe results \"absolutely\" demonstrated black candidates like Gillum and Abrams have a harder time winning in the Trump era, NAACP President Derrick Johnson told the AP.\n\n\"What the president has done is played to the lowest common denominator and created a culture of intolerance and racial hatred,\" Johnson said. \"You build up negative energy based on fear to a point where there are segments of the population who are reacting to fear and not pure policy considerations.\"\n\nLeading Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg agreed that racism likely shaped the elections.\n\n\"This was a big election in which the president used immigration to send a kind of racist message about the need to stand up whites against the invasion,\" Greenberg said of Trump's final-days focus on a caravan of Latin American immigrants heading to the U.S. border to seek asylum.\n\nTrump and his allies took \"every opportunity,\" he continued, \"to attack black politicians and athletes and others.

Rick Scott is trying to stop all the votes from being counted and he is impeding the voting process. I'm replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call that we count every single vote. Always comes down to Florida. Always taking a long time. Recounts now in that state. Let's talk about it at our round table with our senior correspondent Mary Bruce, political correspondent Matthew dowd, Republican commentate of Sara Fagen, former New Jersey governor Chris Christie and former mayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel. Let's start out, Matt, talking overall about the midterms, your big take away. First of all, this is like 12 days of Christmas where as each day goes on it gets better for the Democrats. From this vantage point this was a bad day for the Republicans. It wasn't a split decision. If you take a look at all the data, the Democrats picked up more seats than since watergate. The Democrats picked up more governorships since 1982. When you look at that expanse and then put it in the context that the last president with an economy like this, had a 20-point higher job approval rating and their incumbent -- All true, but how rare is it for a president to pick up seats in the senate and loss seats in the congress? The country is divided geographically and demographically. Places that are red become redder and blue become bluer. The Republicans did do well in the senate. I do agree with Matt, it does speak to the polarization of the country. People are sorting themselves geographically. They live by people like them. Suburban Democrats voted for the house and conservative Republicans voted for the senate. If you think about 2020, particularly if Republicans hold the two seats, it's hard for Democrats to take back the senate in the next election. On the governors race, Democrats did well across the midwest, but did not get the big prize of Ohio and we'll see what happens in Florida. Republicans are at a historic high with 33-50 governorships. There was only one way to go and it was down. When you also -- we talked about this Tuesday. When you have open seats, Republicans are defending 26, 12 are open seats. Those are hard to win. The fact is that you would love to hold 33 seats. You're not going to. Even after this, the majority of the governorships are being held by Republicans. I think there's a blue wave with a red under tow. Both parties have something to crow about. Both have something to worry about. For the Democrats they had no business winning the house with this type of economy and the gerrymandering that went on. A wave reflects you have a force bigger than structural impediments. These are mostly seat that is Hillary Clinton won. They secured. They're securing the majority in the suburban. The governorships are a significant game. The Republicans have something to crow about which is they're starting to solidify a position in Ohio. When you look at the midwest, that's a flashing yellow light for us. What's a flashing yellow light for the Republican party you're losing bad in the suburbs. Democrats if they're smart will block the issues of the Republicans and concentrate on health care, infrastructure and education access. You saw Elijah Cummings talking about that. That democratic rise in suburbs fueled by women candidates. It's reshaped what the halls of congress are going to look like. More than 100 women coming in, Muslim women, native American women. The diversity is tremendous. It changes the way business gets done in Washington to a certain extent. Women are known for getting more legislation through than men. It will be interesting to see if that comes to fruition. The big problem in Washington is grid lock. One more point on the midterms. I think Democrats should have picked up more seats in the house. When you think about where the president's numbers where and the environmental factors, Democrats didn't do as well as they could have because of a very strong economy. This is something in my view hasn't been talked about as much. Democrats should have picked up north of 40 seats. Republicans benefited from the fact that the economy is so strong. Unemployment is so low. Wait a second. '82, '94, '06, '10. Those were all with bad economy. At 3.7% we had no business taking the house. Donald Trump was on the ballot in every congressional district and he lost. That is in the face of gerrymandering. I picked the lock in '06 and Republicans did it again. You can also look at it is this way Democrats should have done better given the way people feel about Donald Trump and Republicans should have done better based on the economy. As Rahm said, there was much to learn on each side. I have the feeling both sides are taking the wrong lessons from this. That's unusual. The fundamental reality and the aftermath of this election which we saw in the aftermath of 2016 is that Democrats have a short-term problem. That's their ability to appeal to the vast swath of the public. They have to figure out how to fix it. The Republicans have a huge long term problem which is their inability to win the national popular vote. They've only done it once in seven presidencies. They lost badly -- it's probably going to be 7 million votes of popular vote loss. Every group is becoming more and more of a solid constituency. George, one other thing, the congress,000 for the first time in our country's history looks like America. I want to look ahead at 2020. Before we get that, I can't waste Chris Christie being here. Never waste, George. The president appointed an acting attorney general. People are talking about you for attorney general. Are you interested? Has he asked? He hasn't asked. We haven't spoken about it. I was in the white house Thursday for a previously scheduled meeting on prison reform. We did a lot with that in new Jersey. It was very successful. The white house is asking me to help with that on the national level. I didn't see the president or speak to him. Listen, I've been through this dance a lot of times before. The fact is a president makes his own decision on these things. I'm thrilled being here with you, George. Why would I want to leave? What about us? I'll reserve on you, Rahm. He obviously met Whitaker under fire. Calls for recusal. Some saying his appointment isn't even legal. How long can he effectively serve as acting attorney general? By the law 210 days. I think he's really there to land the Mueller investigation, to get it done. I think the president wisely didn't want to bring a new person into the mix who was not already in the department. Tough for anybody to get confirmed. Yeah, plus I don't think you want to do that to a new attorney general. Have them have to take on the responsibility of the Mueller investigation. If they have to, they have to. What I think the president is attempting to do is have someone already involved to get the Mueller investigation to its completion and to turn the page for a new justice department afterwards. The only reason sessions is out is because of what he did with the Mueller investigation and the only reason Whitaker has been asked to serve is because what he's said on the Mueller investigation. I think he has to recuse himself. It's a dangerous point for America. The challenge is going to be for the senate Republicans and are they going to find their voice on advise and consent or not. Mitch Mcconnell answered that question. Mitch Mcconnell has answered that question. They're not going to be passing any kind of legislation to protect Mueller even though he thinks the investigation should be able to continue unimpeded. He asked him what assurances he's been given to -- Mark my words, Republican senators underneath him are going to feel the heat. If there's interference. Right. Here's the issue, the assurance is this has been going on for quite sometime. Despite some tweeting, the president hasn't interfered or fired Bob Mueller. When you're this close, it's the conclusion. Most people observe this and watch how Bob Mueller is acts, sending prosecutors back to justice et cetera. He's near the end. I don't believe the president having shown restraint to this point is going to stop now. I think Chris' point is the right one. This has gone on 18 months. Bob Mueller has gotten -- Not that long by special counsel standards. Okay, but they've indicted three dozen people. They've got eight convictions. Hundreds of justice department lawyers and FBI agents have been involved, not to mention all the witnesses and their lawyers. There's no stopping the train that's going to be the Mueller report. Matt Whitaker can't sit on it. There's a Democrat congress now. Even if they did try to sit on it, this is coming out. I totally agree. We can speculate. When Bob Mueller submits his report, it's going to drop like a thud in Washington. It's going to happen right before the Democrats take the house or right after. This idea that somebody is going to be able to control the story, or someone's going to limit what's in there, that's going to drop. It's a huge splash in the pond and everyone is going to have to deal with it. We saw Cummings and Nadler say this isn't the only thing we'll be doing. Democrats are in a real danger here that they've become too investigative. If they just investigate and don't legislate, that's a problem for them. They're trying to say we have priorities here. We're going to reign things in and do it in an orderly fashion. Even if you listen to the priorities in your interview, they range from looking into the census, to conflicts of interest, to the Amazon thing. Nancy Pelosi is going to have to find a way to reign in all that. What should the priorities be? Here's the thing, you can look into trump, if I was in those oversight committees, I would look out for America. That would be my guiding light. I would haul in all the pharmaceutical executives and talk about pricing. I would deal with the anti-trust elements that congress can do. I would not make trump the focus. I would make it about the agenda as it relates to the American people. Anything you do on trump is what's going to get the attention. That may be. The questions to members of congress are about the investigation of trump. I think there are a lot of questions as to what's going on in the EPA and in the interest of polluters why isn't the EPA doing its job there. There's a lot to do with health care costs as it relates to pharmaceuticals. I would look out for America and not just look at trump. I agree with Rahm. We'll see how smart the Democrats are in having this new authority. I guarantee you if they make this about the president, this is what the president is dreaming about. It's what he's wishing for. Judicious, the moment you break that, you're in trouble. They give Donald Trump the opportunity to look like a martyr he's going to take it. There's one thing that hasn't been talked about from the lk election, is the series of Progressive policies that were passed on election day in red states. The minimum wage was raised. Opposed by Republicans in Missouri and Arkansas it was raised. Medicaid was expanded in Nebraska, Idaho and Utah. Gun control passed in Washington by a larger margin than anybody else got elected to. Felons in Florida were given the right to vote. This idea that America is opposed to Progressive policies, Americans in red states vote for them when they're on the ballot. Here's the question, do the Democrats focus on those things where there might be possibility of legislating for example, infrastructure, if they can find the money? If they're smart, they do the investigations, but pass the series of policies and make the senate vote it down. Pass the series of policies and make the senate vote them down. I think the mayor is right. If Democrats want to be smart, they'll focus on their agenda. They'll focus first on infrastructure and health care. It doesn't seem to me -- you look at both your democratic headliners they were talking investigators first. To be fair I was asking questions about investigations. You were. 52 times in this congress they have tried to subpoena. Of course Republicans have kicked those down. They are not going to be able to resist the urge to make this about -- talking about the emoluments clause, we want to have an investigation on that? That tells you everything you need to know. They should pass gun control and raising the minimum wage within two weeks. You're going to see both. They're going to be plowing ahead on legislative priorities and these investigations. So many came out saying they want to come out and protect pre-existing conditions. I think the Democrats will say okay, put your money where your mouth is. On gun control you'll see something quickly come out. One of the biggest mistakes the trump administration did is leading with health care. Yes. I was saying -- They own it now. Right. I said lead with the tax cut and go to infrastructure. Reminds me of you and president Obama. We agree again, Rahm. Don't tell my mother. I won't. The big mistake for the Democrats would be to just do what Matt's saying to do. Pass a bunch of things all of you will be saying the senate is never going to pass it. Force the senate on something that the president is saying he might be willing to consider. This is the key point, the Democrats should triangulate. They should find everything that Mitch Mcconnell and the president don't agree on and go right at it. This will force a division in the Republican party. It will bring in whatever moderate wings of the Republicans are left and bring them over to the democratic side. That's -- do they have the discipline to do that? That's the more than the $64,000 question. That's the $64,000 question. This is where I give speaker Pelosi the credit. She was from day one in 2016 unbelievably strategically discipline to focus on the core issues that matter. I do think it's important. Wherever Mitch Mcconnell is against something, minimum wage, health care cost, pre-existing conditions and the president is for it, you drive 64,000 miles an hour there and triangulate it. Who is going to triangulate, the Democrats or the president? If you look at Donald Trump's history with the exception of trade, his positions have been fairly flexible over time and that's -- Yeah, right. Flexible? We're going to end on that note. You disagree with that? Not at all. He's firm in his opinions. It's the principals he's flexible on. By the way, Rahm worked for a president that had that same ability. We're out of time. We have to end there on that remarkable understatement by Chris Christie.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Fish oil, vitamin D, novel drugs, new cholesterol guidelines: News from an American Heart Association conference over the weekend reveals a lot about what works and what does not for preventing heart attacks and other problems.\n\nDietary supplements missed the mark, but a prescription-strength fish oil showed promise. A drug not only helped people with diabetes control blood sugar and lose weight, but also lowered their risk of needing hospitalization for heart failure.\n\nGood news for everyone: You no longer have to fast before a blood test to check cholesterol. Don't stop at the doughnut shop on your way to the clinic, but eating something before the test is OK for most folks, the guidelines say.\n\nThey're from the Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology and are endorsed by many other doctor groups. No authors had financial ties to drugmakers.\n\nHere are highlights from the conference, which wraps up Monday:\n\nCHOLESTEROL\n\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. High cholesterol leads to hardened arteries that can cause a heart attack or stroke. When guidelines were last revised five years ago, they moved away from just using cholesterol numbers to determine who needs treatment and toward a formula that takes into account age, high blood pressure and other factors to more broadly estimate risk.\n\nThat was confusing, so the new guidelines blend both approaches, setting targets based on the formula and considering individual circumstances, such as other medical conditions or a family history of early heart disease.\n\n\"It will never be as simple as a single cholesterol number,\" because that doesn't give a clear picture of risk, said one guideline panel member, Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones of Northwestern University.\n\nIf treatment is needed, the first choice remains a statin such as Lipitor or Crestor, which are sold as generics for a dime a day. For people at high risk, such as those who have already had a heart attack, the guidelines suggest adding Zetia, which is also sold as an inexpensive generic, if the statin didn't lower cholesterol enough.\n\nOnly if those two medicines don't help enough should powerful but pricey newer drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors be considered. Many insurers limit coverage of them \u2014 Repatha, sold by Amgen, and Praluent, sold by Sanofi and Regeneron \u2014 and the guidelines say they're not cost-effective except for folks at the very highest risk.\n\nFinally, if it's unclear whether someone needs treatment, the guidelines suggest a coronary artery calcium test, which looks for hardening of the arteries, to help decide. It's a type of X-ray with a radiation dose similar to a mammogram and costs $100 to $300, which most insurers do not cover. Lloyd-Jones and others defended its use.\n\n\"Half of people will have a zero calcium score and can avoid a statin very safely,\" a quarter will score high and need treatment, and the rest will need to weigh options with their doctors, he said.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic's Dr. Steven Nissen, who had no role in the guidelines, called them a big improvement but disagreed with \"using a test that involves radiation to decide whether to give a drug that costs $3 a month,\" referring to the price of statins. A cheap test to check for artery inflammation would be better, he said.\n\nFISH OIL, VITAMIN D\n\nTwo major studies gave mixed results on fish oil , or omega-3 fatty acids. There are different types, including EPA and DHA.\n\nIn a study of 26,000 healthy people, 1 gram a day of an EPA/DHA combo, a dose and type found in many dietary supplements, showed no clear ability to lower the risk of heart problems or cancer.\n\nBut another study testing 4 grams a day of Amarin Corp.'s Vascepa, which is concentrated EPA, found it slashed heart problems in people at higher risk for them because of high triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood, and other reasons. All were already taking a statin, and there's concern about the results because Vascepa was compared to mineral oil, which can interfere with statins, and may have made the comparison group fare worse. Still, some doctors said Vascepa's benefits seemed large enough to outweigh that worry.\n\nThe study that tested the lower amount of fish oil in the general population also tested vitamin D , one of the most popular supplements, and found it did not lower the risk of cancer or heart problems.\n\n\"I think we need to accept that that's a good test\" and that the vitamin is not worthwhile, said Dr. Jane Armitage of England's Oxford University. \"We do not see any benefit.\"\n\n\"Don't waste your money on those supplements,\" which are not well regulated and are of varying quality, said Dr. Deepak Bhatt of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\nDIABETES\n\nPeople with diabetes often die of heart disease or heart failure, and new diabetes medicines are required to be tested in large studies to show they don't raise heart risks. One such medicine, Jardiance, surprised doctors a few years ago by lowering the risk of heart attacks and strokes. A second medicine, Invokana, later showed similar benefits but with some worrisome side effects.\n\nA new study tested a third drug, Farxiga, in more than 17,000 diabetics with other heart risk factors and found a lower rate of hospitalization for heart failure or death from heart-related causes \u2014 5 percent among those on the drug versus 6 percent in a placebo group after four years of use. That's on top of the drug's known benefits for controlling diabetes.\n\nCertain infections and a serious buildup of acids in the blood were more common with Farxiga but these were rare and are known complications of the drug. It costs about $15 a day, about the same as similar medicines. Farxiga's maker, AstraZeneca, sponsored the study and many study leaders consult for the company.\n\nOne independent expert, Dr. Eric Peterson, a Duke University cardiologist and one of the conference leaders, said doctors have been eager to know if the earlier studies suggesting these drugs might help hearts were a fluke. Results from the new study, the largest so far, \"could make this class of drugs much more standardly used\" for diabetics with high heart risks or heart failure, he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMarilynn Marchione can be followed at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Andy Grenier, manager of Architecture & Facilities Engineering Facility Sustaining Support, has worked at the resort for 13 years, and has served our country in the United States Coast Guard \u2013 first in active duty, now in the reserve \u2013 for nearly 30 years.\n\nAndy, who is now a Captain in the Coast Guard Reserve, learned many of the skills he currently uses in his role at the Resort while serving in the military. When he was serving on active duty in the Coast Guard, he received a M.S. degree in Fire Protection Engineering, which is part of his role at the resort \u2013 designing systems that keep buildings and people safe from fire danger. Andy credits his time in the Coast Guard for many other skills useful to the workforce. \u201cThe military is a leadership laboratory,\u201d Andy said. \u201cEvery day, I use those same leadership skills here \u2014 inspiring people in the workplace, leading by example.\u201d One particular skill learned in the military that serves Disney cast members well is attention to detail. \u201cAttention to detail matters at Disney for everything from safety to show standards. This is an approach taken in the military as well.\u201d\n\nAndy also serves a leadership role in the Diversity Resource Group SALUTE, a group of cast members who are committed to enhancing the Disney experience for those who have sacrificed in support of the military. This very diverse group is made up not only of veterans who served on active duty and reserve, but cast members who have family members or loved ones who are veterans or currently serving. The group is called upon to offer their unique perspective with insight and expertise on military culture and how that can affect our business, with topics ranging from marketing efforts, to workplace initiatives, to entertainment offerings like the daily flag retreat.\n\n\u201cThe company is very supportive of those who have served or who are currently serving in the military reserve,\u201d Andy noted. Those who serve in reserve duty are typically required to serve 36 days a year, but Andy is sometimes called away more frequently or for longer durations. In 2010 Andy was called away for 60 days to support the response effort for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Most recently, he was serving in Hawaii for a joint military exercise which unexpectedly rolled into a hurricane response when major Hurricane Lane swept through the Pacific in late August.\n\nOn this Veterans\u2019 Day, we salute Andy and all the cast members who have served our country.", "Buried in French President Emmanuel Macron's speech on the sacrifice of \"young men\" in World War I Sunday was a reference to the \"three million widows\" the fallen soldiers left behind.\n\nThe role women played in the war was only mentioned in passing as dozens of world leaders, including Angela Merkel of Germany, gathered in Paris to mark a century since WWI ended.\n\nYet, war impacted women far beyond the obvious hardships of widowhood and the prospect of raising children alone.\n\nAs the nations at war mobilized their entire populations, women in every country contributed during the four and a half years of conflict.\n\nWomen not only served as factory workers, farmers, drivers, teachers and child carers \u2014 they were also sent to the front lines as volunteers and nurses.\n\nSome in Russia fought in battalions. In every warring country, they gave their lives.\n\nMany of their jobs involved danger and caused death. In Britain, women worked in factories, including in the production of weapons \u2014 a key role, given that the side that could produce the most weapons in the war of attrition would ultimately win.\n\nBy 1917, munitions sites, which mostly employed women workers, produced 80 percent of the weapons and shells used by the British Army, according to historian A. V. M. Airth-Kindree.\n\nShe said some female workers in Britain were known as \"canaries\" because they had to handle TNT, which caused their skin to turn yellow.\n\nAround 400 women in Britain died from overexposure to TNT during WWI, according to estimates.\n\nAmong the Allies, organizations such as the Red Cross depended on thousands of female volunteers.\n\nBy June 1918, there were over 3,000 American nurses in over 750 in hospitals in France, as many more served in the Nurse Corps in the US army and naval.\n\nAs nurses, it was common for them to be sent to the front line and witness its horror first hand. One solemn reminder of that lies in the headstones of the Cromwell twins at the Suresnes American Cemetery that US President Donald Trump visited Sunday.\n\nThe two were beloved American nurses who worked tirelessly for the Red Cross in France. They survived the war only to commit suicide in 1919, it's believed, due to the trauma.\n\nWhile most countries banned women from fighting, Russia was the sole country to allow them in combat, from 1917.\n\nOne female combatant, Maria Bochkareva, founded Russia's \"Women's Battalion of Death,\" recovered from injuries and became a decorated commander.\n\nDespite the inequities, the war period was a key moment in the women's movement as it marked the first time on a wide scale that women realized their roles could be beyond domestic.\n\nDuring Sunday's ceremony, a letter written by Denise Bruller to her soldier fianc\u00e9 Pierre Fort was read out, speaking of her emotion and anguish at the end of the war that caused \"upheaval to the very depths of my being.\"\n\nLove and emotion were very much part of the war \u2014 and its propaganda \u2014 and such stories help color the narrative of loss. Less mentioned, but perhaps equally commonplace, was the sleeves-rolled-up grit displayed by female civilians during WWI's bruising slaughter.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press' WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition.

We start with two house Democrats who have the power to investigate the president. Jerrold Nadler and Elijah Cummings. Congressman Cummings, let me begin with you. You heard the president there. He said if Democrats investigate, it would be a war like posture. Are you ready to go to war? I'm not going to war with anyone. I'm going to do what the American people said they wanted us to do through this election, even in trump country they're saying we want transparency. We want honesty and integrity. They want something else. They want accountability with regard to this president. That is exactly what I'm going to do. If I'm blessed to have that opportunity and this is what the constitution requires. We'll do our part. George, I'm not going to be handing out subpoenas like somebody's handing out candy on Halloween. As a lawyer and officer of the court, I take subpoenas seriously. I plan to -- if I have to use them, they'll be used in a methodical way and it must be in the public interest. We have a lot to do. I'm laser focused on those issues that even president trump says he wants to work on, such as prescription drug prices, the high price of prescription drugs. Making sure we protect people with regard to pre-existing conditions. I must admit, that he just came late in saying that, but if he wants to do that, that's fine. We've got a lot of work to do and voting rights. We've got to deal with things like voting rights. We've got a lot on our plate. Don't have time -- I'm not worried about the threats. I want to do what the American people sent us to Washington to do. You're saying you can investigate and work on policy at the same time. What are your top oversight priorities? George, I want to look at some things that affect people on a day-to-day basis such as I said drug prices and health care issues. I also want to look at things like the census. We're having problems with regard to the trump administration wanting to put in a citizenship question which we know will discourage people from participating in the census. It's very important. That's right around the corner. We have to look at things like voter suppression. We cannot have a country where we have -- where it becomes Normal to do everything in folks' power to stop people from voting. There's no reason why in the United States of America people should be standing in line for four to five hours and basically being pushed away from the polls. As a Democrat over the last couple years, you wrote a lot of letters calling for oversight of the president, talking about the emoluments clause. Is that on the table? Definitely. We definitely want to look at the emolument clause violations. We want to look at things like the FBI building fiasco where the president injected himself in the debate as to where he thinks it should be located, we think to his benefit. We've got to figure out is he acting on behalf of the American people in a lots of his decisions or is he acting on his own behalf? There's something else we have to do. The president has two years left in his term. He spent almost his entire campaign talking about our infrastructure. We have to sit down -- he claims he wants to work with us. We need to sit down and address the issue of infrastructure. We've got bridges and roads that need repaired. We've got to do that. We can do that. Your colleague Adam Schiff said he wants to look into the idea of Amazon, whether the president tried to retaliate against Amazon because Jeff bezos owns \"The Washington post\" and whether he interfered in the Time Warner merger as a way to retaliate against CNN. Is that on the table? We may look into that. The president has constantly been messing with our postal service. Seems like he wants to privatize that. We have legislation right now, George that will cure that. We just got to put it on the floor. With the Democrats in control we can get the postal bill on the floor and save the postal system. Those are the kinds of things I want to do. I'm going to look at trump, president trump, but more importantly I'm going to try to work with our Republican friends to do things for the American people. They're tired of us not doing things. On that question of working with Republicans, are you willing to go back to the days where the subpoena power was shared with the minority? I'm going to share to a certain degree. I see subpoenas as really a method of last resort. As a lawyer, I know the power of a subpoena. Once you send somebody a subpoena, they've got to get a lawyer. There's a lot there. I'm hoping that we'll have consultation with the Republicans where we can agree, but if it comes down to me believing something is in the public interest, I want to do it deliberately. I'm going to do what I think is best. I'll do what the constitution demands we do. I would ask that the president not try to stand in our way of doing our job as members of the congress. I want to ask you about that. What are you going to do if the administration and the white house refuse to answer and comply with your subpoenas? We will cross that bridge when we get to it. I'm not going to deal with that hypothetical. I'm more optimistic than that. I promise you, we'll deal with that when we get to it. Nancy Pelosi democratic leader wants to run for speaker. Does she have your vote? She's got my vote. Nancy Pelosi has been battle tested. I've watched here -- I've said it many times. She's a phenomenal speaker. Now that we have all these women coming into the congress, it would be a damn shame that you didn't replace this fearless leader with a man. It's her time and, again, she's battle tested. I'm looking forward to working with her as my speaker. I'm going to vote for her and encourage my colleagues to vote for her.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Transcript for Incoming House Judiciary chair: 'I don't think' Whitaker appointment is legal\n\nI'm going to vote for her and encourage my colleagues to vote for her. Congressman Cummings, thank you. Thank you. We're joined by Jerrold Nadler. Let's pick up there. Does Nancy Pelosi have your vote? Will she be the next speaker? I believe she will be the next speaker. She was wonderful speaker. She's been a great minority leader. She's one of the greatest legislative crafters of our time. Without her leadership, we would not have had the affordable care act. We have would -- we wouldn't have pre-existing conditions. She most certainly has my support. Several of these new members coming in including your colleague from Staten Island max rose say they're not going to support Nancy Pelosi. How serious is that? There's a number of people that won't support her. I think she'll have the overwhelming support of the democratic caucus. I think she will be speaker. You chair the judiciary committee. The president just appointed Matt Whitaker. Do you believe the appointment was legal? I don't think it was. There was no advice and consent. I don't think the attorney general can be appointed without the advice and consent of the senate -- without the consent of the senate. I'll go further. His appointment is part of the attack on the investigation of Robert Mueller, the special counsel. It's part of the pattern by the president. It's a pattern of interference by the president, a pattern of obstructing that investigation. That investigation is very important to assure the rule of law and to assure that we know what happened when the Russians attempted to subvert our election with the alleged complicity of people in the trump campaign. It's very important that the integrity of our elections be assured. We have to protect that investigation. For the reasons I state and to show that not the president, not anybody, is above the law. You say his choice is a pattern of obstruction. When you put all the pieces together over the past year and a half, do you believe the president has obstructed justice? I'm not prepared to say that yet. Let's say there's a lot of evidence to that effect. It's what we'll be looking at. It's what the judiciary committee should have been having proper investigation about. The Republicans in congress didn't want to hold the president accountable. They surrendered their constitutional responsibility to provide checks and balances. We will not. That's part of what we have to look at. The president will learn he's not above the law. That's what we'll hold accountable. Matt Whitaker said he won't recuse himself from the Russian investigation. If he restricts Mueller and blocks a subpoena to the president and refuses to release a final report from Robert Mueller, what recourse do you have? We could subpoena the final report. We could subpoena Mueller and ask him in front of the committee, what was in your final report? Those are things we could do. Any such interference would be a pattern of obstruction of justice especially since -- he should recuse himself. He's expressed total hostility to the investigation. He said the investigation shouldn't go forward. Someone who said that should not be in charge of deciding on the investigation. If Matt Whitaker is the acting attorney general when you become chair of the judiciary committee -- We will make sure that Matt Whitaker -- one of the first orders of business will be to invite him or subpoena him to appear before the committee. You would be responsible for any potential impeachment hearings. You're facing a lot of cross pressure. You laughed. You have top Democrats saying Democrats must pursue impeachment. You have others warning that would be overreach if you've went too quickly. How will you balance that? It's too early to make that determination. You have to be reluctant to do an impeachment. I criticized the Republicans for the Clinton impeachment. I thought it was not based. We'll have to see from the Mueller investigation and whatever we find, because congress should be active in their own investigations and our own responsibility to hold the administration accountability and providing checks and balances. We have to look into all kinds of questions. If we find the president has or has not committed impeachable offenses and whether they rise to the gravity which would necessitate putting the country through the trauma of an impeachment process. What is your top oversight priority? Right now our top priority is to protect the Mueller investigation, to protect the integrity of the investigation from the white house to stifle it and interfere with it. Last time on the program you talked about the possibility of investigating justice Kavanaugh is that still on the table? Ets -- it's not a question of investigating justice Kavanaugh. We have the responsibility to investigate the process under which the FBI was stifled in its investigation bay the white house. When the FBI was asked to investigate, it wasn't a complete investigation. A lot of witnesses who volunteered to come forward weren't interviewed and so forth. We have to look into that with a view toward making sure that future FBI investigations are not subject to the same white house interference and can be relied upon. That's the part we have to look at, not with a view toward doing anything to justice Kavanaugh. He's there unfortunately. With you with a view to making sure the integrity of the process is there going forward. Last two weeks we saw two deadly shootings. Some of your colleagues were elected based on gun control. That comes under the umbrella of the judiciary committee. What are you going to do? We're pursue sensible gun control legislation. That's one of our priorities. I just campaigned in Georgia for Lucy Mcbeth who won her district in an issue that was -- That was newt Gingrich's district. She was a mother whose son was murdered with a gun six years ago in 2012 over a dispute about loud music. She got involved in gun control -- in the gun control cause. She was involved especially after the parkland shootings and the fact that congress has done nothing about this to protect the American people motivated her to run. She'll be an invaluable member of congress for many reasons, among others, the personal experience she brings to bear. We're getting to the point where we're having mass shootings every week now. It's hardly news. We're told by the NRA and others than the problem is mental health. You look at western Europe and Japan. They have 50 gun deaths, 125 gun dates, 150 gun dates. We have 133,000 a year. It's a slander on the American people to say our folks are ten times more mentally ill than the people in Europe or Japan. The problem is the military type weapons, the lack of appropriate background checks. We have to deal with this. Congressman, thank you for your time.

The companies dispute how the extensions should be negotiated: MillerCoors argues that it has sole discretion to determine whether it can continue brewing for Pabst, whereas Pabst says the companies must work \"in good faith\" to find a solution if Pabst wants to extend the agreement but MillerCoors lacks the capacity.\n\nPabst needs 4 to 4.5 million barrels brewed annually and claims MillerCoors is its only option. It is seeking more than $400 million in damages and for MillerCoors to be ordered to honor its contract.\n\nDuring 2015 negotiations about extending the contract, MillerCoors announced it would close its brewing facility in Eden, North Carolina, and that it eventually might have to shutter another facility in Irwindale, California. Pabst contends that MillerCoors refused to provide any information to substantiate its claim that it would no longer have the capacity to continue brewing Pabst's beers, and that it wouldn't consider leasing the Eden facility and would only sell it for an \"astronomical\" price.\n\nPabst says MillerCoors wouldn't agree to an extension unless Pabst paid $45 per barrel \u2014 \"a commercially devastating, near-triple price increase\" from what it pays now. At the March hearing, Paris said MillerCoors knew Pabst couldn't accept that proposal \"because it would have bankrupted us three times over.\"\n\nIn court filings, MillersCoors said Pabst's proposals to keep the Eden facility open \"were commercially unreasonable\" and that Pabst sought \"a windfall through litigation\" instead of offering to pay enough to keep a facility open. It also said the facility's closing was \"to ensure the longer-term sustainability\" of MillerCoors because thousands of new brewers have entered the market over the past decade.\n\nMillerCoors and Anheuser-Busch, which have the biggest U.S. market share at 24.8 percent and 41.6 percent, respectively, have been losing business to smaller independent brewers, imports, and wine and spirits in recent years, according to the Brewers Association.\n\n\"The beer market has shifted and beer lovers are increasingly demanding more variety, fuller-flavor, and local products from small and independent producers,\" said Bart Watson, the Brewers Association's chief economist.\n\nOverall U.S. beer sales have declined, with shipments down from 213.1 million barrels in 2008 to 204.2 million in 2017, according to the Brewers Association.\n\nPabst depends on MillerCoors because the only other U.S. brewer with capacity to make its products is Anheuser-Busch, which doesn't do contract brewing, Paris said.\n\n\"It really is an existential issue for Pabst because it has no real alternatives,\" Paris said at the March hearing.\n\nParis said the report from the consultant MillerCoors hired in 2013 proves the company never intended to act in good faith. Pabst's attorneys say the report had sections focused on how to \"eliminate Pabst altogether\" and noted that MillerCoors would need to close two breweries \"to be sure they don't have excess capacity for contract manufacturing.\"\n\nMillerCoors' attorney, Eric Van Vugt, said in court that the company didn't rely on the consultant's report when it decided to close Eden or when it has contemplated closing the Irwindale brewery.\n\n\"If we keep Irwindale open, yes, we can supply their beer,\" Van Vugt said. \"No one disputes that. That's the only factor that we need to look at.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nIvan Moreno is on Twitter: https://twitter.com/1TrueIvan", "The Latest on the California wildfires (all times local):\n\n6:20 p.m.\n\nAuthorities have reported 6 additional deaths in a Northern California, raising the death toll to 29 and matching the deadliest wildfire on record in California history.\n\nButte County Sheriff Cory Honea said the human remains recovered on Sunday included five bodies found at homes and one in a vehicle in Paradise.\n\nHe also announced that 228 people remain unaccounted for since the fire began Thursday and incinerated the foothill town.\n\nThe statewide total of deaths from wildfires reached 31.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n6:15 p.m.\n\nAuthorities say 228 people remain unaccounted for after a deadly wildfire ravaged a swath of Northern California.\n\nButte County Sheriff Cory Honea announced the figure Sunday night, raising the number of people missing by more than 100.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n5:30 p.m.\n\nSouthern California Edison has reported to state utilities regulators that there was an outage on one of its electrical circuits near where a large and destructive wildfire began as strong winds swept the region.\n\nSoCal Edison says the report to the Public Utilities Commission was submitted out of an abundance of caution although there's been no indication from fire officials that its equipment may have been involved with the start of the fire.\n\nThe utility's report says the so-called Woolsey fire was reported at approximately 2:24 p.m. Thursday, two minutes after the outage on a circuit from a substation.\n\nSimilarly, Pacific Gas & Electric notified regulators there was a problem on an electrical transmission line minutes before a wind-driven fire erupted in Northern California on Thursday and destroyed the town of Paradise.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n5:05 p.m.\n\nFire officials believe no additional structures have burned in the huge wildfire west of Los Angeles.\n\nLos Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said Sunday evening he expects to have a better damage assessment on Monday and expects the number of lost structures to be greater than the last count of 177.\n\nThe return of gusty Santa Ana winds Sunday caused flare-ups, but Osby says the 130-square-mile (337-square-kilometer) fire stayed within its perimeter.\n\nMandatory evacuation orders remain in effect in the areas of the fire in Los Angeles County while neighboring Ventura County expects to lift some evacuations Sunday night.\n\nOfficials also say two people found dead in a car earlier were both adults.

Welcome back. Thank you, George. We saw what the president said on Friday because what the president said earlier this month -- I can tell you Matt Whitaker is a great guy. I know Matt Whitaker. Why did the president change his story? He's saying he didn't know him -- He said I don't know twice. He called me from Paris saying he's got 100% confidence in Matt Whitaker. Mr. Rosenstein has been overseeing the Mueller investigation. He's in place at the number two in justice. What the president means is he's not slotting in somebody who's an old friend or somebody he discussed the Mueller investigation with. There's no evidence to me that Mr. Whitaker knows anything about the ongoing investigation. He's been the chief of staff to the recused attorney general for 13 months. The president wanted to have a continuum and elevate someone who was already there. In this case it was the chief of staff who has been there for 13 months. But, you know, there have been reports pre-dating the choice of Matt Whitaker that he met with the president several times in the oval office. Maybe a dozen times. \"The New York Times\" said they had great chemistry. That's one of the things the president liked about him. He clearly knew Matt Whitaker. He was familiar with his reputation and familiar with his work. We don't understand why he would say I don't know the man. When she's say -- he's saying I don't know, he means I don't know him well or I didn't know him before. He said I didn't meet him before except that he was the chief of staff. I think it's important to show the president is trying to have a continuum. We have been compliant with the Mueller investigation. 33 and counting individuals who have been interviewed or asked to produce information. Everybody has been compliant. I would point out, according to your own ABC poll released this week, you had two data points in there, one, 42% agree with the way Mr. Mueller is handling the investigation. 46% disapprove. 41% believe it's justified. 54% call it politically motivated. We've been compliant. It's going to go on. Nobody is interfering. Has the president asked Matt Whitaker not to interfere with the Mueller investigation? I'm not aware of that. I doubt he would do that. I don't think a democratic congress or Republican congress would allow it. We've been nothing but compliant. In that press conference Wednesday, the president answered 46 questions from 45 reports in that press conference. He said there's no collusion with Russia. If this has gone down other areas, this is away from what we were promised in the beginning which is the fact that a successful campaign colluded with Russia and it did not. One of the thing is everyone is waiting for is will the president answer written questions from Mr. Mueller. Will he do that? You have to ask outside counsel about that. I can't blame the president if he doesn't. Just because of everything that's happened with this investigation. At the same time he said he would be willing to answer questions. I read a report this week. I'm careful not to ask verification of the report one way or the other. I work in the white house. I'm not the president's outside counsel. That the president may be submitting to questions. I have to repeat it, 1.4 pieces of paper and 33 people have met with Mr. Mueller in some type of capacity. We've been nothing but helpful. Comments that Matt Whitaker made as a private citizen doesn't disqualify him from being fair and impartial in overseeing this investigation. The president doesn't want him to recuse? The president didn't discuss that with me. The president called me from Paris and he never said that. I've never heard the president mention Matt Whitaker and the special counsel in my presence. The justice department does an awful lot more for this country beyond the Mueller investigation. There's the question of whether or not the appointment of Mr. Whitaker was legal. You heard Jerrold Nadler say he doesn't think it is. Your husband raised this question. He said that Mr. Trump's installation of Matthew Whitaker after forcing the resignation of Jeff sessions is unconstitutional and it's illegal and it means that anything Mr. Whitaker does or tries to do is invalid. At that same press conference on Friday the president was asked about it. Kellyanne Conway's husband -- You mean Mr. Kellyanne Conway? He wrote that you were unconstitutionally appointing people. He's trying to get publicity for himself. Why don't you do this, ask kellyanne Conway that question. Here we are. Here we are. A few things. Spouses disagree every day. I'm sure you can appreciate that. You don't agree with your husband's argument? No. It's not relevant. People disagree on the constitution. We have a U.S. Circuit court system there to interpret the law and they disagree about the constitution regularly. I think there's something else instructive here. The president's lawyers told him it's constitutional. There's a statute from 1998, the vacancies statute, there's the D.O.J. Opinion from 2003 and there's also, as they said, supreme court precedent. More to this point, the journalist asking the president of the United States referred to him as kellyanne's husband. He's referred to as kellyanne Conway's husband far more than he is his first name. He's referred to that -- The president made that comment -- I'm sure the feminists are proud of me. I offer my advice and opinion to the president in private. I don't need to put it on the op-ed -- by the way none of that will be litigated in the paper. Isn't that hard for you? Spouses disagree all the time. That's right. My wife is a comedian. We basically stay in our own lanes. I stay out of comedy. She stays out of politics. Isn't that hard for you having your husband write an op-ed like that? When the president said Mr. Kellyanne Conway and ask kellyanne Conway, the president is never worried about how it affects him. He worries about how it affects me. I appreciate that from my boss. He's great to the women who work for them. He also is pointing out that -- again, my husband's name is me. I'll keep the rest of the conversation private. I don't think it's nice and I think people questioning publicly aspects of our marriage is very inappropriate. I stay out of other people's lives. On this one I think what people write, rational people disagree about the constitution every single day. I choose because I'm in a position to do so to give my advice and opinion to the president privately. We have recounts in Florida. Governor and senate races, agriculture as well. The president put out a tweet on that yesterday trying to steal two big elections in Florida. We're watching closely. Does the president have any evidence the Democrats are trying to steal the election? The secretary of state says there is none. The evidence is that Rick Scott and Ron Desantis won. In fact Andrew Gillum conceded on the night of the election. They're under the threshold for an automatic recount. Maybe now they are. There's been no recount that has ever turned around a total as large as we have now in either of those races. The agriculture race is encloser. Even mark Elias has said that margins like this can't be overcome. He also made a very peculiar comment saying we're going to win this. That's not what people should be worried about here. People should be worried about a fair process. Any evidence this is being stolen? One piece of evidence? We have boxes of votes appearing out of nowhere. We have Brenda snipes who has been sued successfully by a primary opponent for shenanigans that happened there years ago. She probably shouldn't be in that position. She was appointed by a Republican governor. New Republican governor Ron Desantis will do something about that. She's somebody who had past practices that have come under criticism by Democrats and Republicans. I think that Rick Scott and Ron Desantis will prevail here. We're looking at that. Look at the rules. Marco Rubio has been clear about this, George. He has said if you look at the rules, we're not still counting votes like they are in Arizona. The vote count is over. Those provisional ballots had to be in by a certain -- also can I say something about senator bill Nelson? The last time he ran, he won by 1.1 million votes. Clearly the people of Florida don't want him as their senator. He should go out a little more gracefully. Thank you kellyanne Conway. Powerhouse roundtable is up next. We'll be right back. Powerhouse roundtable is up\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Sri Lanka's president said he dissolved Parliament and called elections to avoid possible violence inside Parliament and around the country if a vote had to be taken to decide whether his chosen prime minister or his sacked rival had the majority support.\n\nIn a televised address to the nation Sunday evening, President Maithripala Sirisena said he heard stories from lawmakers on both sides of possible violence in Parliament that could even result in deaths and clashes spreading around the country.\n\n\"It appeared to me that, if I allowed the Parliament to be convened on the 14th, without dissolving it, it could have brought about commotion and fights in every city and every village would lead to very unpleasant and difficult situation for the average citizens of my beloved country,\" he said.\n\n\"As such, the best solution was not to allow those 225 members in the Parliament to fight each other and allow that to develop into a street fights in every part of the country. It is my duty and the responsibility to ... create the situation for the 15 million voters in this country takes the ultimate decision by choosing their members to the Parliament through a free and fair election.\"\n\nThe U.N. and foreign governments have expressed concerns over Sirisena's decision to dissolve Parliament on Friday and his earlier sacking of Ranil Wickremesinghe, who he replaced with former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa. Wickremesinghe says his sacking is unconstitutional and that he still has a majority support in Parliament.\n\nSirisena initially suspended Parliament until Nov. 16, delaying the possibility of testing the majority. He then dissolved it after being unable to secure support for Rajapaksa and called for elections to take place on Jan. 5. Several political parties have said they will petition the Supreme Court on Monday seeking to nullify Parliament's dissolution.\n\nA statement from U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's office recently expressed concern.\n\n\"The Secretary-General underlines the utmost importance of respecting democratic processes and institutions and resolving differences in accordance with the rule of law and due process,\" his deputy spokesman, Farhan Haq, said.\n\nIn his address to the nation, Sirisena also appeared to issue a warning about Wickremesinghe remaining in the official residence of the prime minister.\n\nHe said only his new prime minister and Cabinet ministers were entitled to use state vehicles and assets at a time of transition and said he will deploy police to take over state assets and take legal action against violators if those assets were not surrendered.\n\nSirisena and Wickremesinghe, who were leading traditionally opposed parties, were part of an awkward coalition government until Wickremesinghe's sacking on Oct. 26.\n\nTensions had been building for some time between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe, who had introduced economic reforms the president did not approve. Sirisena has also accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, an accusation Wickremesinghe has repeatedly denied.\n\nSirisena also has criticized investigations into military personnel accused of human rights violations during Sri Lanka's long civil war against a Tamil separatist group, which ended in 2009. Rajapaksa, who ruled as president from 2005 to 2015, is considered a hero by the ethnic Sinhalese majority for winning the conflict. But he lost a re-election bid in 2015 amid accusations of nepotism, corruption and wartime atrocities.\n\nRajapaksa on Sunday left his longtime political party and joined another, in a move that could weaken Sirisena.\n\nRajapaksa joined the Sri Lanka People's Front, a party of which he was shadow leader for months. A large number of members of Sirisena's Sri Lanka Freedom Party, are likely to join Rajapaksa because he has the biggest following among them.\n\nHowever, both Rajapaksa and Sirisena have said they will face the Jan. 5 election together.\n\nHundreds of people gathered in Colombo, Sri Lanka's capital, on Sunday for a candle light vigil protesting what they purported an unconstitutional dissolution of parliament.", "The repatriation of ethnic Rohingya Muslims from Bangladesh, to which more than 700,000 fled since last year to escape deadly violence carried out by Myanmar's security forces, will begin this week, top Myanmar officials said Sunday.\n\nMinister of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement Win Myat Aye announced at a news conference that Bangladesh had informed Myanmar authorities that repatriation, agreed upon in principle months ago, would begin on Thursday. A Myanmar government statement said an initial group of 2,251 would be sent back from mid-November at a rate of 150 per day.\n\nNoting that the actual date depended upon Bangladesh taking action, Win Myat Aye said, \"Whether it will happen on the day or not, we have to be ready on our side and we try our best to do that.\"\n\nAbul Kalam, Bangladesh's repatriation commissioner, said he was unaware that a date had been set. \"I have got no decision from our foreign ministry or any other higher authorities,\" he said.\n\nThe Rohingya exodus began after Myanmar security forces launched a brutal crackdown following coordinated insurgent attacks in August 2017. The scale, organization and ferocity of the operation led to accusations from the international community, including the United Nations, of ethnic cleansing and genocide. Myanmar's government has denied this.\n\nHuman rights advocates say conditions are not yet safe for the return of the Rohingya refugees, who have generally been denied citizenship and civil rights in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where prejudice against them runs high.\n\nThe U.N.'s independent investigator on human rights in Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, last week urged a halt to \"rushed plans\" for the repatriation, saying a lack of guarantees that the refugees wouldn't face new persecution if they returned home was concerning.\n\nAccording to Sunday's Myanmar government statement, the returning Rohingya would stay at repatriation camps for two days and receive food and clothing before moving on to transit camps. It said China, India and Japan were \"providing necessary assistance\" for the repatriation process, but did not give details.\n\nIt isn't clear how long the returnees would have to stay in the transit camps or where they would go afterward, as many Rohingya villages have been erased by bulldozers, with the land given to local Rakhine Buddhists.\n\nOfficials said Sunday that returnees can get an ID document called a National Verification Card that will allow them to travel anywhere in the Maungdaw area of Rakhine State. They can then begin to apply for citizenship.\n\nBut there is widespread skepticism that any returning refugees will ever be granted citizenship.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of people in Myanmar do not accept that the Rohingya are a native ethnic group, instead seeing them as illegal migrants from Bangladesh and calling them \"Bengalis.\"\n\nIn remarks delivered last month at the United Nations, Yanghee Lee said the Rohingya \"should not go back to ... the oppressive laws, the discrimination. The minimum they need is freedom of movement, access to basic health services.\"\n\n\"Right now, it's like an apartheid situation where Rohingyas still living in Myanmar ... have no freedom of movement,\" Lee said. \"The camps, the shelters, the model villages that are being built, it's more of a cementing of total segregation or separation from the Rakhine ethnic community.\"", "A top White House adviser to President Donald Trump declared that Florida Republican candidates for the U.S. Senate and governorship \u201chave won,\u201d even as the margins between them and their Democratic counterparts were small enough to trigger a mandatory recount under Florida law.\n\nInterested in Midterm Elections?

Sunday, on \"This Week,\" ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos asked counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway if there is any evidence.\n\n\u201cThe evidence is that Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis have won,\u201d she said.\n\nAs soon as Democrats sent their best Election stealing lawyer, Marc Elias, to Broward County they miraculously started finding Democrat votes.

We are watching closely! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 10, 2018\n\n\u201cThey're both underneath the threshold for an automatic recount,\u201d Stephanopoulos pressed on \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe now they are,\u201d Conway said. \u201cBut there has been no recount that has ever turned around a total as large as we have now in either of those races.\u201d\n\nFlorida Secretary of State Ken Detzner, ordered a statewide recount of Florida's Senate, governor and agriculture commissioner on Saturday. All three races are within the .5 percentage point margin or error that requires a recount under Florida law.\n\nReturns from the machine recount are due on Nov. 15th by state law. Nevertheless, outstanding issues, such as potential lawsuits and overseas ballots that are due beyond Nov. 15th may lead the recount fight to draw on for longer.\n\nTrump's repeated allegations of voter fraud and \"election theft\" have provoked outcry from Republicans, who have cast doubt on the ballot counting process.\n\nThank you @marcorubio for helping to expose the potential corruption going on with respect to Election Theft in Broward and Palm Beach Counties. The WORLD is now watching closely! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2018\n\nOn \"This Week,\" Conway cited Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes as a reason to doubt the process. Under her leadership the office has faced bipartisan criticism for its handling of past elections.\n\n\"We have Brenda Snipes who obviously has been sued successfully by a primary opponent to Debbie Wasserman Schultz for shenanigans that happened there years ago. She probably shouldn\u2019t still be in that position,\" Conway said.\n\nIn May, a judge ruled in favor of Wasserman Schultz's primary challenger Tim Canova that Snipes' office had illegally destroyed ballots too soon after the end of his unsuccessful primary challenge.\n\nCristobal Herrera/EPA/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott, also the Republican candidate in the contested U.S. Senate election, echoed Trump\u2019s rhetoric accusing left-wing groups of trying to steal an election and alleging the process had \u201crampant fraud.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not sit idly by while unethical liberals try to steal this election from the great people of Florida,\u201d Scott said during a press conference Thursday.\n\nScott asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate the ballot counting process but the department said Friday they were unable to find any evidence of fraud.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Bill Nelson, Scott\u2019s opponent, released a video Friday accusing Scott of blocking all of the votes from being counted.\n\n\u201cRick Scott is trying to stop all the votes from being counted and he\u2019s impeding the democratic process,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nAP\n\nA report by the Brennan Center for Justice indicates voter fraud is virtually nonexistent and can often be traced to machine or human error.\n\nThe results of the election will ultimately come down to the recount process, but allegations of fraud notwithstanding, Conway expressed confidence that Republicans Scott and DeSantis would prevail because the odds of changing the outcome are low.\n\nA 2016 analysis by FiveThirtyEight found that the average election recount since 2000 swings the total by a little under 300 votes, with the highest swing in that timeframe coming in the 2000 presidential election recount, also in Florida. Al Gore cut George W. Bush\u2019s lead by 1,247 votes, which was not enough to put Gore over the top. Nelson currently trails Scott by 12,562 votes, which would mean he would need a historically large swing in votes to win.\n\nNevertheless, Broward County may offer a window of opportunity for Nelson to gain. The county, which is home to Fort Lauderdale and heavily Democratic, had an unusually high number of ballots exhibiting \u201cundervoting,\u201d which is the term for not voting for all of the races on the ballot.\n\nIn total, Broward County had over 26,000 fewer votes cast in the senate race than the governor\u2019s race. The reason for the issue is unknown, but if this represents a systematic error, it may ultimately swing the race in Nelson\u2019s favor.", "The incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said that if the Trump administration restricts special counsel Robert Mueller or refuses to release a final report from the investigation into Russian meddling during the 2016 election, then the committee could wield its subpoena power.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on \"This Week\" Sunday that, \"We could subpoena the final report. We could subpoena Mueller and ask him in front of the committee and ask him 'what was in your final report?'\"\n\nSources told ABC News last week that Mueller is writing his final report on the nearly 18-month-long investigation, but that the timing for when a final report would be submitted remains unclear.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images, FILE\n\nNadler is the current ranking member and incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee after Democrats won control of the chamber in Tuesday's midterm elections. The committee is responsible for oversight of the federal courts, federal law enforcement, the Department of Justice and would be the first body to consider articles of impeachment in the House.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Nadler called for accountability after Attorney General Jeff Sessions was fired.\n\n\"The firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions fits a clear pattern of interference from President Donald Trump,\" he wrote in the statement. \"If he abuses his office ... then there will be consequences.\"\n\nMatthew Whitaker, President Donald Trump's acting attorney general appointment, has generated controversy since he has previously expressed criticism of the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. He wrote in a 2017 op-ed for CNN that the probe should have been limited.\n\nAllison Shelley/Reuters, FILE\n\nNadler told Stephanopoulos that he doesn't think the appointment of Whitaker was legal, and that the appointment is part of a pattern.\n\n\"His appointment is simply part of an attack on the investigation by Robert Mueller,\" Nadler said on \"This Week.\" \"It's part of a pattern of interference by the president and part of a pattern of obstruction ... of that investigation.\"\n\nLater in the program, counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway said that Whitaker was chosen in order to have a \"continuum\" in the leadership at the Justice Department, by having someone who worked for Sessions take his place. Conway also dismissed the concerns surrounding the president's supposed political motive for appointing Whitaker and his past statements regarding Mueller.\n\n\"There's actually no evidence to me that Mr. Whitaker knows anything about the ongoing Mueller investigation,\" Conway told Stephanopoulos. \"He's been the chief of staff to the recused attorney general for 13 months. But the president wanted to have a continuum.\n\n\"I think comments that Matt Whitaker made as a private citizen on cable TV does not disqualify him from being fair and impartial, by overseeing this investigation.\"\n\nNadler also said that Whitaker will face the House Judiciary Committee if he is still the acting attorney general come January.\n\n\"We will make sure that Matt Whitaker immediately -- one of our first orders of business will be to invite him, and if necessary to subpoena him ... to appear before the committee,\" Nadler said.\n\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\nBut when pressed on whether he believes the president has obstructed justice, Nadler said he can't yet make that determination.\n\n\"I'm not prepared to say that,\" Nadler said, later adding, \"We will provide a check and a balance, we will hold the president accountable. He will learn that he is accountable, that he\u2019s not above the law and that's part of what we\u2019ll have to look at.\"", "Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba is recovering from an undisclosed illness in Saudi Arabia and still performing his duties, according to a statement released Sunday amid mounting speculation about his health.\n\nThe issue is a particularly sensitive one in the Central African nation. When Bongo's father died in 2009 after more than four decades in power, Gabonese officials angrily denied French media reports of his death for almost a day, and shut down the internet in the country for several hours.\n\nThe statement said that Ali Bongo was suffering dizziness at his hotel in Riyad, Saudi Arabia on Oct. 24 when he sought medical care at King Faysal Hospital.\n\nThe information about the president's health is \"extremely reassuring\" and the president \"continues to perform his duties,\" the presidency said.\n\nThe communique came amid a swirl of rumors over the president's health back home in the Central African nation. Some media reports suggested that Bongo had suffered a stroke, though government spokesman Ike Ngouoni cautioned people about \"fake news.\"\n\n\"It would be in his interest entirely to make his presence. I think they're not putting him in front of the cameras intentionally,\" said Douglas A. Yates, a Paris-based Gabon expert.\n\nOne of the world's largest producers of oil, Gabon's wealth is far from evenly distributed. About a third of the population, estimated to be below 2 million people, live below the poverty line, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe elder Bongo, who ruled the oil-rich nation from 1967 until his 2009 death, was viewed by many as the father of the nation. His time in power, though, was dogged by allegations of corruption and the use of oil profits for personal luxuries, including properties in several European and American cities, and lavish trips abroad.\n\nAli Bongo won a special presidential election that was held a few months after his father's death. The opposition claimed it was rigged.\n\nIn 2016, protesters took to the streets of the capital, Libreville, and the Parliament building was burned after Bongo's opponent, Jean Ping, accused Bongo of vote-rigging. The European Union, the United States, and France also expressed concerns about some of the results. Gabon's constitutional court later upheld Bongo's victory.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNierenberg reported from Dakar, Senegal.

Here now, chief anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n\nGood morning and welcome to This Week. The midterms had something for everyone. Democrats take back the House with well north of 30 new members. Republicans solidify their hold on the senate. Two more seats right now.\n\nAnd political junkies now have a recount in Florida to relish, bringing back those 2000 memories of butterfly ballots and hanging chads.\n\nTuesday night President Trump called the midterms a tremendous success. So, why was he so angry the rest of the week mocking Republicans.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: Mia Love gave me no love and she lost, too bad.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Attacking reporters.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: That's such a racist question.\n\nWhat a stupid question that is. What a stupid question.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And warning Democrats.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: They can look at us, and we can look at them. And it will go back and forth.\n\nAll it is, is a war-like posture.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: This morning, we start with two of the House Democrats who will have the power to investigate the president -- Jerrold Nalder, the incoming chair of the House Judiciary Committee; Elijah Cummings who will chair the Oversight Committee.\n\nAnd Congressman Cummings, let me begin with you this morning. You just heard the president right there. He said that if Democrats investigate it's going to be a war-like poster. Are you ready to go to war?\n\nREP. ELIJAH CUMMINGS, (D) MARYLAND: I'm not going to war with anyone. What I am going to do is do what the American people said they wanted us to do through this election, even in Trump country, they basically are saying that we want transparency, we want honesty and we want integrity.\n\nBut they want something else, George, they want accountability with regard to this president. That is exactly what I'm going to do, if I'm blessed to have that opportunity and this is what the constitution requires of us.\n\nAnd so we're going to do our part.\n\nBut George, I'm not going to be handing out subpoenas like somebody's handing out candy on Halloween. I take this as a lawyer and as an officer of the court, I take subpoenas very seriously. And I plan to, if I have to use them, they will be used in a very -- in a methodical way and it must be in the public interest. And so -- but we\u2019re going to -- we need -- we have got a lot to do. So, I'm laser focused -- laser focused on those issues that even President Trump says that he wants to work on, such as prescription drug prices, the high price of prescription drugs, such as making sure that we protect people with regard to pre-existing conditions.\n\nI must admit that he just came late in saying that, but, you know, if he wants to do that, that's fine. But we've got a lot of work to do. And voting rights. We have got to deal with things like voting rights.\n\nSo, we've got a lot on our plate. We don't have time -- I'm not worried about the threats, I am -- I am -- again, I want to do what the American people sent us to Washington to do.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So you're saying you can investigate and work on policy at the same time. What are your top oversight priorities?\n\nCUMMINGS: George, I really want to look at some things that affect people on a day to day basis such as, as I said drug prices and health care issues. But I also want to look at things like the census. We are having some problems right now with regard to the Trump administration wanting to put in a citizenship question, which we know will discourage people from participating in the census. Very important. That\u2019s right around the corner.\n\nAgain, we\u2019ve got to look at things like voter -- voter suppression. We cannot have a country where we do -- where we have -- it becomes normal to do everything in folk\u2019s power to stop people from voting.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason why in the United States of America people should be standing in line for four and five hours and -- and basically being pushed away from the polls. We\u2019ve got to turn that around.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And when you\u2019re in the minority as a Democrat over the last couple years, you\u2019ve written a lot of letters talking about the need for oversight of the president, whether he\u2019s in violation of the emoluments clause, other cabinet officials. Are those on the table as well?\n\nCUMMINGS: Definitely. Definitely. We definitely want to look at the emolument clause, possible violations. I think there are probably many of them. We want to look at things like the FBI building fiasco where the president injected himself into that debate as to where it would be located, we think for his benefit. We got to figure out when is he acting on behalf of the American people in a lot of his decisions or -- or is he acting on his own behalf? But there\u2019s something else that we\u2019ve got to do.\n\nThe president has two years left in his term. He spent almost his entire campaign talking about our infrastructure. We have to sit down -- he says -- he claims -- he claims he wants to work with us. We need to sit down and address the issue of infrastructure. We\u2019ve got bridges and roads that need to be repaired and we\u2019ve got to do that -- and we can do that.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Your colleague Adam Schiff said they want to look -- he also wants to look into the idea of Amazon, whether the president tried to retaliate against Amazon because Jeff Bezos, the owner, owns the Washington Post and involving the Postal Service there. Also whether he interfered in the merger -- in the Time Warner merger as a way to retaliate against CNN. Is that on the table?\n\nCUMMINGS: Yes, we may want to look into that. Keep in mind that the president has constantly been messing with our postal system. I don\u2019t -- it seems as if he wants to privatize it. And we have legislation right now, George, that will cure that. We just got to put it on the floor. When -- with the Democrats in control we can get that postal bill on the floor and makes -- and save our postal system. And those are the kinds of things that I want to do. Not only -- I\u2019m going to look at Trump -- President Trump, but I\u2019m also -- but more importantly I\u2019m going to try to work with our Republicans friends to do things for the American people. They\u2019re tired of us not doing things.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: On that question of working with Republicans, are you willing to go back to the days where the subpoena power on the Oversight Committee and other committees was a shared responsibility with the minority?\n\nCUMMINGS: I\u2019m going to share to a certain degree. And again, I see subpoenas as really a method of last resort. As a lawyer, I know the power of a subpoena. Once you send somebody a subpoena, they\u2019ve got to get a lawyer, and -- and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a lot there. So what I\u2019m going to try -- I\u2019m hopefully -- I\u2019m hoping that we\u2019ll have consultation with the Republicans, where we could agree. But -- but if it comes down to me believing something is in the public interest, I want to do deliberately -- deliberatively. But I\u2019m going to do what I think is best. And I\u2019m going to do what the Constitution demands that we do.\n\nAnd I would ask that the president not try to stand in our way of doing our job as members of the Congress.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Well I want to ask you about that. What are you going to do if the administration or the White House refuse to answer and comply with your subpoenas?\n\nCUMMINGS: We will cross that bridge when we get to it. I\u2019m not going to deal with that hypothetical because I\u2019m -- I\u2019m more optimistic than that. But I promise you we will deal with that when we get to it.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Final question. Nancy Pelosi, Democratic leader wants to run for speaker. Does she have your vote?\n\nCUMMINGS: She\u2019s got my vote. Nancy Pelosi has been battle-tested. I have watched her -- I\u2019ve said it many times, she\u2019s a phenomenal speaker. And so she -- she -- and now that we have all of these women coming into the Congress it would be a damn shame that you then replaced this fearless leader with a man. It is -- is -- it\u2019s her time and again, she\u2019s battle-tested and I\u2019m looking forward to working with her as my speaker. And I\u2019m going to vote for her and encourage all my colleagues to vote for her.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman Cummings, thanks for your time this morning.\n\nCUMMINGS: Thank you.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And we\u2019re joined now by the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Jerrold Nadler of New York. Congressman, let\u2019s pick up where we just left off with Congressman Cummings. Does Nancy Pelosi have your vote, will she be the next speaker?\n\nREP. JERROLD NADLER (D), NEW YORK: I believe she will be the next speaker. I think Nancy was a wonderful speaker, she\u2019s been a great minority leader and I think she\u2019s one of the finest legislative craftspeople of our time. I think without her leadership we would not have had the Affordable Care Act, we wouldn\u2019t have preexisting conditions, and she most certainly has my support.\n\nI will do anything I can to make sure that she\u2019s the speaker again.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Several of these new members coming in, including your colleague from Staten Island, Max Rose, say they\u2019re not going to support Nancy Pelosi for speaker.\n\nHow \u2013 how serious a threat is that?\n\nNADLER: Well I think there are \u2013 there are a number people who won\u2019t support her, but I think she will have the overwhelming support of the Democratic caucus and I think she will be elected speaker.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You chair \u2013 you will chair the Judiciary Committee, the president just announced that Matt Whitaker will be the acting attorney general. Do believe that appointment was legal?\n\nNADLER: I don\u2019t think it is legal because there\u2019s no advice and consent. I don\u2019t think the attorney general can \u2013 can \u2013 can be appointed without advice and consent of the \u2013 of the Senate, without the consent of the Senate.\n\nBut I\u2019ll go further, the \u2013 his appointment is simply part of an attack on the investigation by Robert Mueller, the special counsel. It\u2019s part of a pattern of interference by the president and part of a pattern of obstruction of that \u2013 attempt of obstruction of that investigation.\n\nAnd that investigation is very important to assure the rule of law and to assure that we know what happened when the Russians attempted to subvert our election with the alleged complicity of people in the Trump campaign.\n\nIt\u2019s very important that the integrity of our elections be assured. And so we have to protect that investigation for the reasons I just stated and to show that not \u2013 not the president, not anybody is above the law.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You say his choice is part of a pattern of obstruction. When you put all the pieces together over the last year and a half, do you believe the president has obstructed justice?\n\nNADLER: I\u2019m not prepared to say that yes \u2013 to say that yet. Let\u2019s say that there\u2019s a lot of evidence to that effect, but that\u2019s what we will \u2013 we will be looking at. It\u2019s what the Judiciary Committee and the Intelligence Committee should have been having proper investigations about but the Republicans in Congress did not want to hold the president accountable.\n\nThey surrendered their constitutional duty of \u2013 of providing a check and a balance. We will not. We will provide a check and a balance, we will hold the president accountable. He will learn that he is accountable, that he\u2019s not above the law and that\u2019s part of what we\u2019ll have to look at.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So far Matt Whitaker says he\u2019s not going to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. If he restricts Mueller, if he blocks, for example, a subpoena of the president, if he refuses to release a final report from Robert Mueller, what recourse do you have?\n\nNADLER: Well we could \u2013 we could subpoena the final report, we could subpoena Mueller and ask him in front of the committee what was in your final report, those are things we could do.\n\nBut the fact is any such interference would be part of a pattern \u2013 pattern of obstruction of justice, especially since \u2013 and he should recuse himself because he has expressed total hostilities, he\u2019s \u2013 to the \u2013 to the investigation.\n\nHe has said the investigation shouldn\u2019t go forward, and someone who said that should not be in charge of deciding on the investigation.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So if Matt Whitaker is still the acting attorney general when you become chair of the Judiciary Committee \u2013\n\nNADLER: We \u2013 we will make sure that Matt Whitaker immediately \u2013 one of our first orders of business will be to invite him and if necessary to subpoena him to appear \u2013 to appear before the committee.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You would be responsible as chair of the Judiciary Committee for any potential impeachment hearings. And you\u2019re facing a lot of cross pressures, you\u2019ve got \u2013 see (ph) you just laughed at that idea.\n\nYou\u2019ve got top Democrats like Tom Steyer, Op-Ed in the New York Times this week saying Democrats must pursue impeachment. You\u2019ve got a lot of others warning that that would be overreach if you went too quickly. How are you going to balance that out?\n\nNADLER: Well I think it\u2019s too early to \u2013 to make that determination. You have to be very reluctant to do an impeachment. I criticized the Republicans 20 years ago for the Clinton impeachment because I thought it was not based.\n\nWe will have to see from the Mueller investigation, from whatever we find, because Congress should be active in our own investigations and our own upholding of our duty to hold the administration accountable and to provide a check and a balance.\n\nWe have to look into all kinds of questions. We\u2019ll have to find out, if we find it \u2013 that the president has or has not committed apparently impeachable offenses and whether those impeachable offenses rise to the gravity which would necessitate putting together \u2013 putting the country through the trauma of an impeachment process.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And what is your top oversight priority?\n\nNADLER: Right now our top priority is to protect the Mueller investigation, to protect the integrity of that investigation from the White House attempt to stifle it and to \u2013 to interfere with it.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Last time you were on the program before the elections, you talked about the possibilities of investigating Justice Kavanaugh. Is that still on the table?\n\nNADLER: Well it\u2019s not a question of investigating Justice Kavanaugh. We do have a responsibility I believe to investigate the \u2013 the process by which the FBI was stifled in its investigation by the White House.\n\nWhen the FBI was asked to investigate, there was not a complete investigation, for the reasons I state then. A lot of witnesses who should\u2019ve been \u2013 who volunteered to come forward weren\u2019t \u2013 weren\u2019t interviewed and so forth. But we have to invest -- look into that with a view toward making sure that future FBI investigations are not subject to the same kind of White House interference and -- and can be relied upon.\n\nThat\u2019s the \u2013 the part that we \u2013 I think we have to look at, not with a view toward doing anything about Justice Kavanaugh there \u2013 he\u2019s there, unfortunately \u2013 but with a view toward making sure that the integrity of the process for the future is restored.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: The last couple weeks, you\u2019ve seen two more deadly mass shootings in this country. Several of your colleagues, new Democrats in the House are elected, promising to pursue more serious gun control. That comes under the umbrella of the Judiciary Committee. What are you going to do?\n\nNADLER: Well, we will certainly pursue sensible gun control legislation as one of our priorities. You know, we just elected \u2013 I campaigned in Georgia a few weeks ago for Lucy McBath who won her election in \u2013 in a district, which I think was originally Newt Gingrich\u2019s\u2026\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Gingrich.\n\nNADLER: \u2026District. She was a mother whose son was murdered with a gun six years ago in 2012 over a dispute over loud music. And she got involved in -- in gun control \u2013 in the gun control cause. She was involved especially after the Parkland shootings. And the fact that Congress has done nothing about this to protect the American people motivated her to run and she will be a very invaluable member of Congress for many reasons, but among others, for the personal experience she brings to bear upon this.\n\nWe\u2019re having \u2013 we\u2019re getting to the point now where we\u2019re having mass shootings every week. It\u2019s not even \u2013 it\u2019s hardly news. You know, we have \u2013 we\u2019re told that \u2013 by the NRA and others that the problem is mental health or whatever. But you look at Western Europe, you look at Japan and they have 50 gun deaths, 120 gun deaths, 150 gun deaths, we have 33,000 a year. It\u2019s a slander on the American people to say that our people are 10,000 times as mentally ill as people in Western Europe or Japan.\n\nThe problem is the unfettered use of assault \u2013 of military-style weapons, the lack of appropriate background checks, and we will do \u2013 we will have to deal with this.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman Nadler, thanks for your time this morning.\n\nNADLER: Thank you.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Up next, we have the White House response from Counsel Kellyanne Conway, plus our powerhouse roundtable. We\u2019ll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well Matt Whitaker -- I don\u2019t know Matt Whitaker. Matt Whitaker worked for Jeff Sessions and he was always extremely highly thought of and he still is. But I didn\u2019t know Matt Whitaker. I don\u2019t know Matt Whitaker. Matt Whitaker has a great reputation and that\u2019s what I wanted. In all fairness to Matt Whitaker -- who again, I didn\u2019t know, OK? Other than through reputation. Matt Whitaker is a highly respected man, but I didn\u2019t know Matt Whitaker.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: That was the president on Friday talking about his pick for the acting attorney general, Matt Whitaker. We\u2019re joined now by the president\u2019s counselor, Kellyanne Conway. Welcome back to THIS WEEK, Kellyanne. So we saw what the president said on Friday, which, you know, raised a lot of eyebrows because of what the president said earlier this month. Just want to show everybody.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: I can tell you Matt Whitaker\u2019s a great guy. I mean, I know Matt Whitaker --\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So why did the president change his story?\n\nKELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: The president is saying he didn\u2019t know him before. I mean, he\u2019s not slotting in just an old friend of his. He\u2019s actually elevating --\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But I don\u2019t know -- twice, just what we just showed.\n\nCONWAY: But what he means is -- and I talked to him just this morning, he called me from Paris about this to say he\u2019s got 100 percent confidence behind Matt Whitaker. The deputy attorney general has called Matt Whitaker a superb choice, says, quote, he knows the department, he knows the work. That\u2019s important because Mr. Rosenstein has been overseeing the Mueller investigation and he\u2019s still in place as the number two at Justice. What the president means is he\u2019s not slotting in somebody that\u2019s an old friend or somebody he thinks that he\u2019s discussed the Mueller investigation with at length.\n\nThere\u2019s actually no -- no evidence to me that Mr. Whitaker knows anything about the ongoing Mueller investigation. He\u2019s been the chief of staff to the recused attorney general for 13 months. But the president wanted to have a continuum. He wanted to elevate somebody who\u2019s already, in this case the chief of staff who\u2019s been there for 13 months and keep the DAG in place also.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Right, but you know, there have been reports even predating the choice of -- of -- of Matt Whitaker that he had met with the president several times in the Oval Office, maybe a dozen times. New York Times said they had great chemistry, that\u2019s one of the things the president liked about him. He clearly knew Matt Whitaker, was -- was familiar with his reputation, was familiar with his work, so we just don\u2019t understand why he would tell the whole country I don\u2019t know the man.\n\nCONWAY: Well he\u2019s saying -- no, no, he\u2019s saying I don\u2019t know him, he\u2019s saying I don\u2019t him well or I didn\u2019t know him before. He said in your last part of the clip I didn\u2019t know him before except that he was the chief of staff and that he\u2019s highly respected. That\u2019s all he means. And I think it\u2019s important to show that the president is trying to have a continuum because we\u2019ve already been very compliant with the Mueller investigation. 1.4 million pieces of paper produced, 33 and counting individuals who either have been interviewed or asked to produce information. Everybody has been very compliant.\n\nAnd I would point out, though, according to your own ABC News poll released this week, you know two data points in there that are instructive. One is 42 percent approve of the way Mr. Mueller is handling the investigation, 46 percent now disapprove. That's different. And in the separate question, according to the poll you released, 41 percent believe it's a justified investigation, and 54 percent call it politically motivated.\n\nWe've been compliant. It's going to go on. Nobody\u2019s interrupting it and interfering with it, but I think many Americans have a legitimate question when will this end?\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So, has the president asked Matt Whitaker not to interfere with the Mueller investigation?\n\nCONWAY: I am not aware of that. I doubt that he would do that, because it would just -- it would prolong it. And Congress, the Democratic Congress, I don't think a Republicans Congress would allow that, George. We've been nothing but compliant.\n\nBut let's go back, too, to what the president said on Wednesday in that stem winder (ph) of a press conference, he answered 68 questions from 35 reporters, and a few of them had to do with the Mueller investigation and also with Russia collusion. He's saying what he said all along, there is no collusion with Russia. And if this investigation has taken other areas, gone down other avenues, that's -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s again, away from what we were all promised from the beginning which is the campaign that I ran to a successful part somehow colluded with Russia. We did not.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: One of the things that everybody has been waiting for is whether the president answer the questions of Robert Mueller. Does the president intend to submit written answers to the questions from Mueller. Will he meet with him in person?\n\nCONWAY: Well, you\u2019d have to ask his outside counsel that. But I don't know -- I can't really blame the president if he doesn't just because of everything that has happened with this investigation.\n\nBut at the same time, he has always said he would be willing to answer the questions. I read a report this week. And I'm careful not to ask for verification of the report one way or the other, I work in the White House. I'm not the president's outside counsel, George, that the president may be submitting answers to questions. So, we'll see what happens.\n\nBut I have to repeat it, 1.4 million pieces of paper and over 33 people have met with Mr. Mueller in some type of capacity. We've been nothing but helpful here.\n\nAnd I think comments that Matt Whitaker made as a private citizen on cable TV does not disqualify him from being fair and impartial by overseeing this investigation.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So, the president does not want him to recuse from the Mueller investigation?\n\nCONWAY: The president has not discussed that with me. In fact, this morning when he called me from Paris he said I'm 100 percent -- we were talking about other things, but I'm 100 percent behind Matt Whitaker, and he's never asked him to recuse -- in fact, I've never heard the president mention Matt Whitaker and Bob Mueller in the same sentence in my presence. And I've been in some of those meetings in the Oval Office with Matt Whitaker. He's there doing the Justice Department's business.\n\nThe Justice Department does an awful lot more for this country beyond the Mueller investigation, and we should remember that.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: There's also the question of whether or not the appointment of Mr. Whitaker is legal. You saw Jerrold Nadler say he doesn't think it is. Your own husband raised this question in an op-ed in The New York Times. I want to read that for everyone. He said that Mr. Trump's installation of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general of the United States after forcing the resignation of Jeff Sessions is unconstitutional, it's illegal, and it means that anything Mr. Whitaker does or tries to do in that position is invalid.\n\nAnd at the same press conference on Friday the president was asked about it.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Kellyanne Conway's husband..\n\nTRUMP: You mean Mr. Kellyanne Conway?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE; He wrote that you were unconstitutionally appointing...\n\nTRUMP: He's trying to get publicity for himself. Why don't you do this, why don't you -- why don\u2019t you ask Kellyanne that question, all right?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCONWAY: So, here we are.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Here we are.\n\nCONWAY: So, a few things, people disagree -- spouses disagree every day. I'm sure you can appreciate.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So, you don't agree with your husband's argument?\n\nCONWAY: No, I don't. But it's also not relevant. In other words, people disagree on the constitution, that's why we have a U.S. circuit court system and indeed a United States Supreme Court. They are there to interpret the law and they disagree about the Constitution regularly.\n\nWhen the president -- but I think there's something also instructive here. The president's lawyers apparently have told him that he's got -- it's constitutional. There's a statute from 1998, obviously, the vacancies statute. There is the DOJ opinion from 2003, and there's also, I think as they said, Supreme Court precedent.\n\nBut more to this point, the journalist asking the president of the United States the question referred to him as Kellyanne's husband. And he is referred to Kellyanne Conway's husband, or Kellyanne's husband far more often than he's referred to even by his first name.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So, the president makes that Mr. Kellyanne Conway.\n\nCONWAY: Which is -- I'm sure the feminists are very proud of me, George, that I'm an independent thinker who has a strong, powerful position in this United States government, counselor for the president. I offer my advice and opinion to the president in private. I don't need to put on the op-ed pages of any -- and by the way, none of this will be litigated in newspapers, or on TV.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Isn't that hard for you? Like you say, spouses disagree all the time, that's exactly right. My wife is a comedian. We basically stay in our own lanes. I stay out of comedy, she stays out of politics. Isn't it hard for you to have your husband writing an op-ed like that disagreeing with the president?\n\nCONWAY: I will tell you this, it is -- with the president -- when the president says Mr. Kellyanne Conway and ask Kellyanne, the president is never worried how it affects him. He's always worried about how it affects me.\n\nAnd I really appreciate that from my boss, from the president. He is really great to the women who work for him and he also is pointing out that I \u2013 that he \u2013 again, my \u2013 my husband\u2019s known as me.\n\nI\u2019ll keep that \u2013 I\u2019ll keep the rest of the question private. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s nice and I think people questioning publicly aspects of our marriage and the rest of our life is very inappropriate because I stay out of other people\u2019s lives.\n\nBut on this one, I think what people write is \u2013 rational people, reasonable people disagree about the Constitution every single day. And I choose, because I\u2019m in a position to do so, to give my advice and opinion to the president privately.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: We have recounts now in the state of Florida, governor and Senate races, agriculture as well. The president put out a tweet on that yesterday, \"Trying to steal two big elections in Florida. We are watching closely\".\n\nDoes the president have any evidence the Democrats are trying to steal those elections? The Secretary of State says there is none.\n\nCONWAY: Well the evidence is that Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis have won. In fact, Andrew Gillum conceded on the night of the election, now we\u2019re going backwards.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Well they\u2019re both underneath the threshold for an automatic recount.\n\nCONWAY: Now \u2013 maybe now they are, but there has been no recount that has ever turned around a total as large as we have now in either of those races. I\u2019d say the agriculture race is even \u2013 agriculture commissioner race is even closer.\n\nBut so no \u2013 and even Marc Elias, the attorney for \u2013\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Democrat\u2019s attorney.\n\nCONWAY: Yes, Democrat\u2019s attorney, has stated in the past that margins like this can\u2019t be overcome. He also made a very peculiar comment saying that we\u2019re going to win this. That\u2019s not really what people should be worried about here.\n\nPeople should be worried about a fair process. And George, we just can\u2019t \u2013\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Any evidence \u2013 any evidence this is being stolen? One piece of evidence?\n\nCONWAY: Well yes, we have \u2013 we have boxes of votes just appearing out of nowhere. We have Brenda Snipes who obviously has been sued successfully by a primary opponent to Debbie Wasserman Schultz for shenanigans that happened there years ago.\n\nShe probably shouldn\u2019t still be in that position so maybe new governor \u2013\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Appointed by a Republican.\n\nCONWAY: -- new Republican Governor Ron DeSantis will do something about that. But she\u2019s \u2013 she\u2019s obviously someone who\u2019s had past practices that have come under criticism by Democrats and Republicans.\n\nAnd I \u2013 I think that Scott \u2013 Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis will prevail here. And we\u2019re looking at that. But \u2013 but also look at the rules, Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida has been very clear about this, George.\n\nHe has said if you look at the rules, we\u2019re not still counting votes like they are in Arizona for example. The vote count is over and those provisional ballots had to be in by a time certain, that is not five days after the election which is what today. Also I say something about Senator Bill Nelson.\n\nThe last time he ran in 2012, he won by 1.1 million votes, clearly the people of Florida don\u2019t want him to be their senator anymore and he should go out a little bit more gracefully. They want fresh blood.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: It is in the threshold for recount. We\u2019ll see how that turns out. Kellyanne Conway, thanks for your time this morning.\n\nCONWAY: Thank you, George.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Roundtable is up next, we\u2019ll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGOV. RICK SCOTT (R), SENATE CANDIDATE, FL: I will not sit idly by while unethical liberals try to steal this election from the great people of Florida.\n\nBILL NELSON, SENATOR (D-FL): Rick Scott is trying to stop all the votes from being counted and he\u2019s impeding the democratic process.\n\nRON DESANTIS, FLORIDA GOVERNOR-ELECT: It is important that everyone involved in the election process strictly adhere to the rule of law.\n\nANDREW GILLUM, FLORIDA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: I am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call that we count every single vote.\n\n(VIDEO ENDS)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Always comes down to Florida, always takes a long time, recounts now in that state. Let\u2019s talk about it on our roundtable with our senior congressional correspondent, Mary Bruce; our chief political analyst, Matthew Dowd; Republican strategist, Sara Fagen, also a CNBC contributor; Chris Christie, former New Jersey Governor, also an ABC news contributor; and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. So I\u2019ve got two veterans of the 2000 recount, I don\u2019t want to give you any PTSD.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSo let\u2019s start out \u2013 Matt, just talk overall about the midterms; your big takeaway from what we saw on Tuesday night.\n\nMATTHEW DOWD, ABC NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think you have to put \u2013 well, first of all, this is like 12 days of Christmas where as each day goes on, it keeps getting better for the Democrats as each race turns and the congressional races turns. I think from \u2013 for this vantage point, this was a bad day for the Republicans. It wasn\u2019t a split decision, it wasn\u2019t the president did well. If you take a look at all the data, the Democrats are going to have picked up more seats than they\u2019ve picked up since Watergate.\n\nThe Democrats are going to have a larger popular margin in a midterm since 1986. The Democrats all picked up more governorships \u2013 net governorships since 1982. And so when you look at that expanse, and then put it into context, the last president with a job \u2013 with an economy like this had a 20-point-higher job approval rating and their incumbent \u2013 their incumbent party gained\u2026\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: All true, but how rare is it for a president to lose seats in the House, pick up seats in the Senate?\n\nDOWD: I think that\u2019s reflective \u2013 I actually think that\u2019s one of the things that came out of election night, which we saw in 2016, which is the country is incredibly divided both geographically and demographically. And so I think more and more you\u2019re having places that are red become redder and places that are blue become bluer.\n\nSARA FAGEN, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: It was a good night for Republicans in the Senate. And the fact of the matter is they were expected to break even, maybe pick up one. It looks like they\u2019re going to pick up two, maybe more, depending upon how these \u2013 these uncalled races end up turning out. And I do agree with Matt; it does speak to the polarization of the country. People are sorting themselves geographically. They live by people like them.\n\nAnd so suburban Democrats voted for the House, conservative Republicans voted for the Republican Senate. And I think that if you think about 2020, particularly if Republicans hold the two seats, it gets hard for Democrats to take back the Senate in the next election which means Republicans are going to have a strong voice for a long time.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: On the governor\u2019s race, Chris, we were talking about this a lot on Tuesday night. Democrats did well across the Midwest but did not get that big prize of Ohio and we\u2019ll see what happens with Florida.\n\nCHRIS CHRISTIE, FORMER NJ GOVERNOR (R) AND ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No, and listen, Republicans were at a 100-year historic high with 33 of the 50 governorships. I mean, there was only one way to go and it was down. And the fact is, when you also \u2013 and we talked about this on Tuesday night; when you have open seats, you know, we -- Republicans were defending 26, you know, 12 of them were open seats, those are hard to win.\n\nAnd so, you know, the fact is that you\u2019d love to hold 33 seats even if the Republicans all the time are not going to, even after this, you\u2019re still going to have a majority of the governorships being held by Republicans.\n\nRAHM EMANUEL, MAYOR OF CHICAGO: Well, I think there\u2019s a blue wave with a red undertow. And both parties have something to crow about, both parties have something to be concerned about. For the Democrats, there\u2019s no business winning the House. With this type of unemployment and a gerrymandered map, a wave reflects that you have a force bigger than structural impediments\u2026\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: They seem to be mostly Republican \u2013 I mean, mostly seats that Hillary Clinton won.\n\nEMANUEL: No, but also \u2013 listen, they\u2019re \u2013 they\u2019ve secured and they\u2019re starting to secure the majority in the suburbs and some exurbs areas. The governorships is a significant gain for them. The biggest win for the Democrats, we finally got a farm team after a big drought. And that\u2019s a big, big announcement. And the Republicans have something to crow about which is they are starting to solidify a position in Ohio. When you look at the entire Midwest, that is a flashing yellow light for us.\n\nWhat\u2019s a flashing yellow light for the Republican party, is you are losing \u2013 losing and losing bad in the suburbs and there\u2019s a new metropolitan majority, in my view, that Democrats, if we\u2019re smart, will block the wedge issues of the Republicans and start to solidify on healthcare costs, infrastructure, education access, and I think that\u2019s a possibility for us to build.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And you saw a lot of newcomers talking about that -- that -- that Democratic rise in suburbs mainly fueled by Repub \u2013 I mean women candidates, over 100 coming into the House right now.\n\nMARY BRUCE, ABC NEWS SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It\u2019s completely reshaped what the halls of Congress are going to look like. I mean, you have more than 100 women coming in; Muslim women, Native American women, the diversity is really tremendous and it does, in many ways, change the way that business does get done in Washington to a certain extent. Women, for instance, are known for getting more legislation through than -- than men.\n\nIt will be interesting to see whether any of that comes to fruition because the change now that we have in Washington is gridlock, gridlock, gridlock.\n\nFAGEN: One more point on the midterms. I actually think Democrats should have picked up more seats in the House. When you think about where the president\u2019s numbers were, the other environmental factors politically, Democrats didn\u2019t do as well in the House as they could have because of a very strong economy. And this something, in -- in my view, hasn\u2019t been talked about as much. I think Democrats should have picked up north of 40 seats. But Republicans benefitted from \u2026\n\nEMANUEL: Wait.\n\nFAGEN: \u2026 the fact that the economy is so strong, unemployment is so low and if you look at the exit polling, all those voters who said the economy was good or excellent broke heavily to the Republicans.\n\nEMANUEL: Wait -- look, wait a second, \u201982, \u201994, \u201906, and \u201910. Those were all with a bad economy. At 3.7 percent we had no business taking the House. Donald Trump was on the ballot in every congressional district and he lost. That it -- is unbelievably -- it\u2019s a gerrymandered map, I picked the lock once in \u201906. The Democrats picked the lock again and they did it in a face of the best employment. Republicans wanted to run on the economy, two months out, Donald Trump said I\u2019m going to run on immigration.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But you can also look at this way, Democrats should have done better given how unpopular President Trump is. Republicans should have done better given how -- how strong the economy is.\n\nDOWD: Well, I mean, as -- as Rahm said, there was much to -- much to learn on each side. And I have a feeling that both sides may be taking the wrong lessons from this election.\n\nEMANUEL: That\u2019s so unusual for us\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDOWD: I -- I think what\u2019s really the fundamental reality in the aftermath of this election which we saw in the aftermath of 2016 is Democrats have a short-term problem. And the short-term problem is their ability to appeal to a vast swath of the country geographically which is reflected in the states. It\u2019s a short-term problem. They have to figure out a fix.\n\nThe Republicans, on the other hand, have a huge long-term problem which is their inability to win the national popular vote. They\u2019ve only done it once in seven presidencies. They lost badly. It\u2019s going to probably be 7 million votes of popular vote loss. And every major group that is the fastest growing group in America is becoming more and more part of a solid constituency. And George, one other thing is that the Congress now, for the first time in our country\u2019s history, looks more like America.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And -- and I want to get to that as we look -- look ahead to 2020. Before we get there though, we -- I -- I can\u2019t waste time and, Chris Christie, you\u2019re on the roundtable today. Given the fact that the president is \u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCHRISTIE: It\u2019s never a waste, George, never a waste! STEPHANOPOULOS: \u2026 acting attorney general, he has not picked a permanent attorney general. People are talking about you -- talking about you for that job. Are you interested? Has he asked?\n\nCHRISTIE: He hasn\u2019t asked and we haven\u2019t even spoken about it. So I was in the White House Thursday for a previously scheduled meeting on prison reform and sentencing reform which we did a lot of in New Jersey, it\u2019s been really successful. And so the White House has asked me to help with what they\u2019re trying to do on the national level. And that\u2019s what I was doing there; I didn\u2019t even see the president or speak to him.\n\nSo you know, listen, I\u2019ve been through this dance a lot of times before. You know, the fact is the president makes his own decisions on these things and I\u2019m -- I\u2019m thrilled being here with you, George, so why would I want to leave?\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But -- but setting aside your personal \u2026\n\nEMANUEL: But what about us?\n\nCHRISTIE: I\u2019ll -- I\u2019ll -- I\u2019ll reserve on you, Rahm.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: \u2026 setting aside your \u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: \u2026 personal situation, obviously Matt Whitaker under fire, calls to recusal. Some saying he doesn\u2019t -- his appointment isn\u2019t even legal. How long can he -- can he effectively serve as acting attorney general?\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, by the law, 210 days. But I -- I think he\u2019s really there to land the Mueller investigation, to get it done. I think the president, I think wisely, did not want to bring a new person into the mix who was not already in the Department.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Tough for anybody to get confirmed in that situation\u2026\n\nCHRISTIE: Yes. And this -- and -- and -- and, plus, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d want to do that to -- to a new attorney general, to have them have to take on the responsibility of the Mueller investigation. Now, if they have to, they have to. But I think what the president\u2019s attempting to do here is to have someone\u2019s who\u2019s already been involved, to get the Mueller investigation to its completion, and then to turn the page for a new Justice Department afterwards.\n\nEMANUEL: Look, I think that the only reason Sessions is out is because of what he did on the Mueller investigation. And the only reason Whitaker is being asked to serve is because of the Mueller investigation. And I think he has to recuse himself because, I think, it\u2019s a very, very dangerous point for America that\u2019s beyond this moment. And I think the real challenge is going to be for the Senate Republicans. Are they going to find their voice on actually being advise and consent or not? And the real --\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But Mitch McConnell has already answered that question.\n\nBRUCE: Mitch McConnell has made very clear that they\u2019re not going to be passing any kind of investigation to protect Mueller, even though he feels that the investigation should be allowed to continue unimpeded. He hasn\u2019t said yet, though, and he\u2019s been asked repeatedly what assurances he\u2019s been given that make him feel that the investigation doesn\u2019t need that kind of protection \u2026\n\nEMANUEL: Well, mark -- mark my words, some Republican Senate -- senators underneath him are going to feel the heat on this and be keened up \u2026\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: If there\u2019s an interference not, you know, \u2026\n\nBRUCE: \u2026 Right.\n\nCHRISTIE: The assurance is that this has been going on now for quite some time. And despite some tweeting and some other things that have gone on, the president hasn\u2019t interfered. The president hasn\u2019t fired Bob Mueller. And so the fact is that when you\u2019re this close to what it looks like is the conclusion, and I think most people observe this and watch how Bob Mueller\u2019s acting, sending prosecutors back to U.S. attorney\u2019s offices, et cetera, he\u2019s near the end. The -- I -- I just don\u2019t believe that the president having shown restraint to this point is going to stop showing restraint now.\n\nFAGEN: I -- I think that Chris\u2019 point is the right one, which is this has gone on 18 months, Bob Mueller has gotten almost \u2026\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Not that long by special counsel standards.\n\nFAGEN: \u2026 Well, but -- okay, but they\u2019ve -- they\u2019ve indicted three dozen people, they\u2019ve gotten eight convictions, hundreds of Justice Department lawyers and FBI agents have been involved in this, not to mention all the witnesses and their lawyers. There\u2019s no stopping the train that is going to the Mueller report. Matt Whitaker can\u2019t sit on it. There\u2019s a Democratic Congress now. So even if they did try to sit on it, this is coming out.\n\nDOWD: I totally agree with this. What\u2019s going to happen is we can speculate and all on what\u2019s going to happen and all that but when Bob Mueller submits his report it\u2019s going to drop like a thud in Washington. And it\u2019s either going to happen right before the Democrats take the House where they have all the committees or right after they take the House. And this idea that somebody\u2019s going to be able to control the story or somebody\u2019s going to limit what\u2019s in there, that\u2019s going to drop and then every -- that\u2019s a huge splash in the pond and then everybody\u2019s going to have to deal with it.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Yes, pretty clear -- we all -- we heard that from Congressman Nadler. We also saw both Cummings and Nadler try to say listen, this is not the only thing we\u2019re going to be doing. Democrats are sensitive to that charge.\n\nBRUCE: Well, because Democrats are in real danger that they\u2019ve become too investigative. If they just investigate and don\u2019t legislate, that\u2019s a problem for them. And they\u2019ve trying to say whoa, whoa, whoa, no, we\u2019re -- we have priorities here, we\u2019re going to rein things in, we\u2019re going to do this in an orderly fashion. But even if you listen to just the priorities laid out in your interviews this morning -- I mean, they range from looking into the census to conflicts of interest to the Amazon deal. I mean, there are a lot of things that this Congress wants to look into and Nancy Pelosi, if she is speaker, which it does seem likely, is going to have to find a way to corral all of that.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You served with her. What should the priorities be right now?\n\nEMANUEL: Well a couple things. One is I would actually refocus the -- you know, look, here\u2019s the thing. You can look into Trump but if I were in those investigatory and oversight committees, I would look out for America. That would be my guiding light. I would haul in all the pharmaceutical executives and talk about pricing and collusion there, I would actually deal with the antitrust elements that Congress can do. I would not make Trump being totally your focus.\n\nI would make it about your agenda as it relates to the American people.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Realistically, though, while you do that -- anything you do on Trump is what\u2019s going to get all the attention.\n\nEMANUEL: Well that may be but you -- George, like, the questions to all the members of Congress are about the investigation of Trump. I actually think there\u2019s a lot of questions as it relates to what\u2019s going on at EPA and -- then -- in the interest of environmental polluters, why isn\u2019t the Justice Department and EPA doing their job there, there\u2019s a lot to be done on healthcare costs as it relates to pharmaceutical insurance companies and I would look out for America with the oversight, not just look at Trump.\n\nCHRISTIE: And by the way, I agree with Rahm on this. I mean, we\u2019re going to see how smart the Democrats are in having this new bit of authority, because I guarantee you if they decide to make this about the president, that is what the president is dreaming about.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nEMANUEL: One word -- judicious. Right? The moment you break that, you\u2019re in trouble.\n\nCHRISTIE: If they -- if they give Donald Trump the opportunity to look like a martyr, he\u2019s going to take it.\n\nDOWD: And there\u2019s evidence -- there\u2019s -- there\u2019s one thing that has not been talked about from the election, which is great evidence for them -- for the Democrats doing something affirmatively on this, is the series of progressive policies that were passed on election day in red states. So the minimum wage was raised, opposed by Republicans, in Missouri and Arkansas, it was raised. Medicaid was expanded in three red states, Nebraska, Idaho and Utah.\n\nGun control passed in Washington by a larger margin than anybody else got elected to and felons in Florida, by a huge margin, were given the opportunity to be able to vote. And so this idea that America\u2019s opposed to progressive policies -- when the policies are put on the ballot without attached to party, Americans in red states vote for them.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But here\u2019s the question -- and then I want to go to Sarah and Mary -- do the Democrats focus on those things that they can pass in the House but they aren\u2019t going to go through the Senate or do they focus on things where there might be some possibility of actually legislating, for example, maybe infrastructure if you can find the money.\n\nDOWD: I think if they were -- if they were smart and they do this, I think they -- they -- they do the investigations but pass a series of policies and make the Senate vote them down. Pass a series of policies and make the Senate vote it down.\n\nFAGEN: I think the mayor\u2019s right. If Democrats want to be smart about their approach, they will focus on their agenda, they will focus first on trying to do an infrastructure bill, first on doing something on healthcare. It doesn\u2019t seem to me -- I mean when you look at both of your Democratic headliners today, they were talking investigations first and --\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Well to be fair, I was asking questions about investigations.\n\nFAGEN: He -- you -- you -- you were, but 52 times in this Congress they have tried to subpoena. Of course Republicans have kicked those down. They are not going to be able to resist the urge to make this about every -- I mean, talking about the emoluments clause? Really? We want to have an investigation on that?\n\nDOWD: George --\n\nFAGEN: That tells you everything you need to know about --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDOWD: -- they should pass gun reform and raising the minimum wage within two weeks of taking office.\n\nBRUCE: Well, and I think you\u2019re going to see both. Right? They\u2019re going to be plowing ahead on their legislative priorities and tackling these investigations and I think you\u2019re going to see issues like healthcare, where you had so many Republicans come out and say they want to do something to protect pre-existing conditions. I think Democrats are going to say OK, you know, why don\u2019t you put your money where your mouth is? And also I think on -- on -- on gun control you\u2019re likely to see very quickly something on that.\n\nCHRISTIE: One of the single biggest mistakes the Trump administration made at the beginning was leading with healthcare.\n\nEMANUEL: Yes.\n\nCHRISTIE: You know, I was saying --\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: They own it now.\n\nCHRISTIE: -- right from the -- well, yes. And I\u2019ve said right from the beginning lead with the tax cut first and then go to infrastructure.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: It reminds me of you and President Obama, right.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCHRISTIE: We agree again, don't we, Rahm.\n\nEMANUEL: Don't tell my mother.\n\nCHRISTIE: I won't.\n\nThe big mistake for the Democrats would be to just do what Matt's saying to do, just pass a bunch of things that all of you will be saying, well, the Senate is never going to pass it. Force the Senate on something that the president is actually saying saying he might be willing to consider. Like infrastructure--\n\nEMANUEL: This is the key point, the Democrats should triangulate. They should find everything that Mitch McConnell and the president don't agree on and go right at it, because that will force a division in the Republican Party and bring in whatever moderate wings of the Republicans are left and bring them over to the Democratic...\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Do they have the discipline to do that?\n\nEMANUEL: Well, that's a more than a $64,000 question. And that's a very -- no, do they have the discipline? And I actually think strategically this is where I give Speaker Pelosi -- and I'm going to say I think she will be the speaker, the credit, because she was from day one in 2016 after all the shambles, she has been unbelievably strategically disciplined as you saw when she talked about on impeachment, to focus like a laser on the core issues that I think matter.\n\nI do think it's important wherever Mitch McConnell is against something -- minimum wage, health care cost, pre-existing conditions, and the president is for it, you drive like 64,000 miles an hour right there and you hit it.\n\nCHRISTIE: Who is going to triangulate, the Democrats or the president? And I think that's going to determine a lot of what's going to happen. And I think if you look at Donald Trump's history, with the exception of trade, his positions have been fairly flexible over time and that\u2019s going to allow you--\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDOWD: Yeah, right.\n\nCHRISTIE: You disagree with that, Matt?\n\nDOWD: No, I don't disagree with that at all.\n\nCHRISTIE: My point is that allows someone...\n\nDOWD: He's firm in his opinions, it's the principles that he\u2019s flexible on.\n\nCHRISTIE: Rahm worked for a president who had that same ability in Bill Clinton.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: We are out of time. We're going to have to end on that remarkable understatement from Chris Christie. We'll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: On this Veteran's Day, we honor our fellow Americans who serve and sacrifice.\n\nIn the month of October, one service member died in Afghanistan.\n\nThat is all for us today.

Elijah Cummings and incoming House Judiciary Committee Chair Rep. Jerrold Nadler told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos that their committees\u2019 powers should be used judiciously.\n\nIn an exclusive interview on \u201cThis Week\u201d Sunday, Cummings said subpoena power cannot be abused.\n\n\u201cI'm not going to be handing out subpoenas like somebody's handing out candy on Halloween, I take this as a lawyer and as an officer of the court, I take subpoenas very seriously and I plan to, if I have to use them, they will be used in a very, in a methodical way, and it must be in the public interest,\u201d Cummings said.\n\nHe added that the subpoenas will be used as a \u201cmethod of last resort.\u201d\n\nWith a House majority and a larger budget, Democrats on the Oversight Committee will have more flexibility to pursue their investigations.\n\nCummings has already drafted a list of 64 subpoenas and inquiries relating to concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s activities. Republicans rejected the list in the most recent Congress, but Democrats have expressed an interest in revisiting those requests when they assume the majority in January.\n\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\nIt\u2019s then that Democrats will be able to issue subpoenas and compel federal officials to turn over records and testify before their committees. Their powers also include the ability to ask the Internal Revenue Service to turn over individual tax records for review, including those of Trump. The incoming chairs of at least four committees -- Oversight, Judiciary, Intelligence and Ways and Means -- have expressed an interest in pursuing investigations into Trump, his administration and his personal finances.\n\nTrump, however, has called the House\u2019s plans to investigate him a \u201cwaste\u201d of taxpayer money, even threatening to have the Republican Senate investigate them in return.\n\nIf the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level. Two can play that game! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2018\n\nIn another interview on \u201cThis Week,\u201d Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the incoming Democratic chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said his committee will also provide oversight on the Trump administration. When it came to pushing for impeachment, however, Nadler was measured, citing his own previous opposition to the Clinton impeachment.\n\n\u201cYou have to be very reluctant to do an impeachment,\u201d Nadler said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to find out\u2026 that the president has or has not committed apparently impeachable offenses and whether those impeachable offenses rise to the gravity which would necessitate putting together, putting the country through the trauma of an impeachment process.\u201d\n\nNadler added that the impeachment process depends on what comes out of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report. When Stephanopoulos asked Nadler what his committee\u2019s top oversight priority would be, Nadler said it would be to ensure Mueller\u2019s investigation can continue unimpeded.\n\nAndrew Harnik/AP, FILE\n\n\u201cOur top priority is to protect the Mueller investigation, to protect the integrity of that investigation from the White House attempt to stifle it and to \u2013 to interfere with it,\u201d Nadler said.\n\nAmid fears that Trump will interfere with investigations into his campaign and administration, Cummings asked the president not to stand in the way of committee efforts to investigate.\n\nStephanopoulos followed up by asking what his response will be if the president does not cooperate and comply with subpoenas.\n\n\u201cWe will cross that bridge when we get to it. I'm not going to deal with that hypothetical because I'm more optimistic than that,\u201d said Cummings.", "Street battles raged on Sunday in several areas of Yemen's contested port city of Hodeida, where a U.S.-backed, Saudi-led coalition is trying to drive out Iran-backed Shiite rebels, officials said.\n\nThey say airstrikes from warplanes and Apache attack helicopters shook residential neighborhoods throughout the day, while ground forces clashed around the university in the city's south, as well as al-Thawra and May 22 hospitals to the east.\n\nResidents said they heard heavy gunfire and saw smoke rising from both areas, with several military vehicles on fire near the university. Intense fighting around al-Thawra Hospital blocked access to it for hours, while rebels retook the May 22 hospital after it fell briefly to the coalition, they said. Photos of damaged hospital buildings have been circulating on social media.\n\nCloser to the port facilities, the gateway for vital humanitarian aid, rebel gunmen occupied one the country's largest flour mills and posted fighters on its rooftop, one official added. He said efforts are ongoing to evacuate workers inside the site he feared could now be targeted by airstrikes.\n\nMedical officials in the southern port city of Aden, a coalition stronghold, say some public hospitals there have reached capacity from a steady flow of war wounded from contested fronts across Yemen, and are refusing to accept new patients except for some civilians with critical wounds.\n\nAll officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they weren't authorized to brief reporters, while the residents did so for fear over their safety.\n\nThe conflict in Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country, began with the 2014 takeover of the capital, Sanaa, by the rebels, known as Houthis, who toppled the internationally recognized government. A Saudi-led coalition allied with the government has been fighting the Houthis since 2015 in an attempt to restore the mostly exiled government to power.\n\nThe war has killed an estimated 10,000 people, and left around two thirds of Yemen's population of 27 million relying on aid, with more than 8 million at risk of starvation.\n\nDoctors have reported several civilians including children killed since the latest offensive on Hodeida began on November 1, shortly after the U.S. called for a cease-fire by the end of the month.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Maggie Michael contributed to this report", "The Latest on events marking the centennial of Poland's independence (all times local):\n\n3:10 p.m.\n\nPoland's president has addressed thousands of people ahead of an Independence Day march in Warsaw that has for the first time been jointly organized by state officials and nationalist organizations.\n\nMost of the people in the crowd held the national white-and-red flag. But flags could also be seen belonging to the National Radical Camp, a far-right group that is one of the key organizers. The flag shows a falanga, a far-right symbol dating to the 1930s of a stylized hand with a sword.\n\nAlso visible are the flags of Forza Nuova, an Italian group whose leader Roberto Fiore unabashedly describes himself as fascist.\n\nSunday's march is part of celebrations marking Poland's 100th anniversary of statehood regained at the end of World War I after more than a century of foreign rule.\n\nPresident Andrzej Duda and government had agreed to march with the nationalists on the condition participants only carried the national flag.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n10:45 a.m.\n\nPoland is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its rebirth as an independent state on Sunday with a multitude of events across the country, including marches, Masses, and the national hymn being sung in more than 600 public places.\n\nThe national white-and-red flag fluttered from buildings and buses, dignitaries and regular citizens placed flowers and wreaths at memorials to the father of Polish independence, Marshal Jozef Pilsudski, and the historic Sigismund Bell, reserved only for the most important national events, rang out over Krakow.\n\nPoland regained its independence at the end of World War I in 1918, reborn from the ashes of three defeated powers that had partitioned and ruled the Central European nation for more than a century.\n\nThe ceremonies in Poland coincide with world leaders gathering in Paris on Sunday to mark the armistice of what was then called the Great War.\n\nTo mark the occasion, the Foreign Ministry in Warsaw released a video with citizens of countries from the United States to Germany to Japan reading out the diplomatic cable of Nov. 16, 1918, that informed the world about the creation of the Polish Republic.\n\nSigned by Pilsudski, commander in chief of the armed forces, it declared that Poland \"wishes to notify the governments and nations of the existence of an independent Polish state, encompassing all the territories of a reunified Poland.\"\n\nPresident Andrzej Duda attended a Mass early Sunday and laid wreaths at monuments honoring Pilsudski and other fathers of Poland's independence.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Tusk, a former Polish prime minister and a top European Union leader, took part in an emotional ceremony at a statue of Pilsudski, singing the anthem with leaders of Poland's opposition Civic Platform party and a crowd that gathered with them.\n\nPoland's regained independence fulfilled the dreams of generations of patriots who had kept the language and culture alive despite foreign rule and repression. Though Poland was ruled by Russia, Germany and Austria, and effectively was \"wiped off the map\" as a state, it was nonetheless a great age for Polish culture, producing the compositions of Frederic Chopin and the works of the great Romantic-era poet Adam Mickiewicz, which largely revolved around the yearning for Poland's rebirth.\n\nThroughout it all, the Roman Catholic church played a key role in keeping the language and the identity alive.\n\nContemplations of Poland's historic achievement in 1918 are inevitably shaped by knowledge of what came later, with Poland to be invaded and occupied yet again in the 20th century by the Germans and the Soviets, and then being under Moscow's influence during the Cold War era.", "Emergency officials in Romania say a 20-year-old stabbed another man and then drove a car into people on a road and at a shopping mall, injuring 10 in total. None of the injuries are considered life-threatening.\n\nBraila County Police spokeswoman Laura Dan said the stabbing allegedly happened following an altercation over ownership of the vehicle. Dan says the suspect drove off and allegedly struck two people on a ring road, then later rammed the doors of a shopping mall in the city of Braila.\n\nSeven people were injured at the mall, including two children ages 11 and 13.\n\nBraila Emergency Hospital spokeswoman Alina Neacsu said the stabbing victim had chest and stomach wounds and underwent surgery.\n\nDan says the suspect had a blood alcohol level of 0.37 mg and was uninjured.

Police believe one of the dead could be a minor.\n\nPolice also found six kilograms of hashish near the boat. They suspect that the drugs belonged to boat's owner and the pilot, who police were looking for along with three others.\n\nPolice have located eight more Moroccan men from a total of 15 people they believe to have been on board.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Spain's maritime rescue service reported it had saved 179 people from seven boats its rescue craft intercepted either in the Strait of Gibraltar or nearby waters.\n\nEarlier this week, at least 17 migrants died when attempting the perilous run from North Africa to Spanish shores.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, over 2,160 people have died trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe this year, 564 of them trying to reach Spain.\n\nSpain is one of the main entry points for Europe for thousands of migrants, many of whom are delivered by human traffickers.\n\nNearly 54,000 migrants have entered Europe this year through Spain.

Many have faced arrest or gunfire by border guards.\n\nIranian border guards have been especially vigilant after last month's abduction of 14 guards in a militant attack on one of their posts.\n\nIran has previously called on Pakistan to help secure kidnapped guards held in a border area.", "Excerpts from speeches by the leaders of former enemies France and Germany, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, at events Sunday commemorating the centennial of the World War I armistice .\n\nMACRON\n\n\"Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism: Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism. In saying 'our interests first, whatever happens to the others,' you erase the most precious thing a nation can have, that which makes it lives, that which causes it to be great and that which is most important: Its moral values.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\"I know, the old demons are resurging, ready to finish off their work of chaos and death. New ideologies manipulate religions, push a contagious obscurantism. Sometimes, history threatens to retake its tragic course and threaten our heritage of peace that we believed we had definitively settled with our ancestors' blood.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\"For four years, Europe almost committed suicide. Humanity had sunk into a hideous labyrinth of merciless battles, in a hell that engulfed all fighters, whichever side they were on, whatever nationality they had ... 10 million dead, 6 million injured and mutilated, 3 million widows, 6 million orphans, millions of civilian victims.\"\n\nMERKEL\n\n\"This war, with its senseless bloodshed, showed where national arrogance and military hubris can lead.

It was raining and very muddy,\" he said. \"It's raining today, 100 years later.\"\n\nKearsey and his wife traveled to Europe to tour World War I battlefields \"to honor the lost.\"\n\nOfficial commemorations held to mark the 100th anniversary of the agreement between the Allies and a defeated Germany that silenced guns on the Western Front have provided an opportunity to contemplate the implications of the first war of its kind.\n\nBut for the children and grandchildren of soldiers who were injured or killed in more than four years of brutal fighting, the centennial offered a moment to reflect on the enduring toll of decisions made by world leaders very much like the presidents, prime ministers and kings also standing in the rain.\n\nIn central London, thousands of people marched in a \"people's procession\" to honor fallen soldiers. Descendants of many veterans attended the march , which was described as an expression of gratitude for those who fought in WWI and other conflicts.\n\nParticipants passed central London's Cenotaph war monument, where senior members of Britain's royal family and national leaders had placed wreaths earlier in the day.\n\nAmong them were Marion Lewis and Dorothy Heslop, sisters who said they wanted to honor their grandfather. Pvt. John Waters who suffered a severe head wound during World War I while fighting in France.\n\n\"They did not expect him to survive, so they left him outside the medical tent and we think it's the cold that probably saved him,\" Heslop told Britain's Press Association.\n\nGrowing up, they said, it was an unspoken rule not to ask granddad about the war.\n\nOliver Davies was a 21-year-old driver for the Royal Engineers when he was hit by a stray bullet while taking animals to water near Jerusalem in 1917. His family still has the letter from Davies' captain informing his mother of his death.\n\nHis great-grandniece, Jackie Sheridan, attended the London march.\n\n\"It's a very proud moment to represent my family who are descendants,\" Sheridan said. \"It's going to be emotional to see everybody here, knowing there's 10,000 of us.\"\n\nAs for William Kearsey of Australia's 33rd Battalion, he survived the trench in Belgium hit by enemy fire because of a friend who dragged him out. But coming home with severe damage from the first war to use industrial-era war equipment like machine guns, Kearsey faced a new hell.\n\nHis injuries included lost sinuses and tear ducts. But years of surgery in Britain and South Wales gave the veteran another chance at life, Peter Kearsey said of his father, who died in 1971.\n\n\"He was a kind, gentle man. He suffered a lot right up till his death,\" the son recalled.\n\nSome 62,000 Australians died on the battlefields of the Great War, and 150,000 were injured, according to Kerry Neale of the Australian War Memorial. She stood with Peter Kearsey and his wife in the rain.\n\n\"He didn't talk of the fighting, except how he was saved by his best friend,\" Kearsey said.", "A fresh wave of fighting erupted between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip on Sunday, leaving an Israeli soldier and seven Palestinians dead, just as Israel and Gaza's Hamas rulers had appeared to be making progress toward ratcheting down months of border violence.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what set off the sudden, rare late-night burst of violence.\n\nIn a statement early Monday, the Israeli military said an officer was killed and another one was moderately injured during \"an operational activity\" in southeast Gaza Strip in which an exchange of gunfire was evolved. The operation had ended and the families of the soldiers were notified, it added.\n\nEarlier, Hamas' armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, said Israeli undercover forces in a civilian vehicle infiltrated three kilometers (two miles) into Gaza and fatally shot Nour el-Deen Baraka, its local commander in Khan Younis town. It said militants discovered the car and chased it down, prompting Israeli airstrikes that killed \"a number of people.\" The clashes cooled down early Monday.\n\nThe Israeli military reported earlier that \"all IDF soldiers back in Israel.\" It did not elaborate.\n\nThe Palestinian Health Ministry said six people, including at least five militants, were killed and seven others wounded. In the early hours, a seventh body was found.\n\nIn Israel, the military said it had intercepted two rockets fired from Gaza as air raid sirens continued to sound.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on an official visit to France, announced he was rushing back to Israel to deal with the crisis.\n\nSunday's development shattered what appeared to be a turning point after months of bloodshed along the Israel-Gaza border, with weekly Hamas-led protests drawing thousands to the perimeter fence with Israel. Over 170 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the border protests, in which Palestinians throw rocks, burning tires and grenades toward Israeli troops.\n\nLast week, Israel allowed Qatar to deliver $15 million in aid to Gaza's cash-strapped Hamas rulers. Hamas responded by lowering the intensity of Friday's border protest.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Netanyahu had defended his decision to allow the transfer of the Qatari money, rejecting criticism that the move had strengthened the Islamic militant group.\n\nNetanyahu told reporters that it was \"the right step\" at the moment and that he was committed to restoring quiet along the Israel-Gaza frontier and preventing a humanitarian crisis in the coastal Palestinian territory.\n\n\"Every action, without exception, has a price,\" he said. \"If you can't handle the price you cannot lead. And I can handle the price.\"\n\nIsraeli critics, including members of Netanyahu's hard-line coalition, accused him of capitulating to violence and of granting relief to the embattled Hamas group.\n\nThe internationally backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose forces lost control of Gaza to Hamas in 2007, angrily accused the U.S. and Israel of being involved in a \"conspiracy\" to permanently sever Gaza from the West Bank. He promised to take unspecified measures against his Hamas rivals in the coming days.\n\nHamas leaders in Gaza have described the arrival of the $15 million, delivered last week in three suitcases by a Qatari diplomat, as their first major gain of more than seven months of weekly protests along the perimeter fence.\n\nHamas has been leading the protests since March 30 in a bid to ease a crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade that was imposed in 2007 in order to weaken the militant group. The blockade has led to over 50 percent unemployment and chronic power outages, and prevents most Gazans from being able to leave the tiny territory.\n\nIsrael says it is defending its border against militant infiltrations, but its army has come under international criticism because of the large number of unarmed protesters who have been shot.\n\nWith Hamas threatening to intensify the protests and international officials warning of a looming humanitarian crisis, Netanyahu on Thursday allowed the cash into Gaza. It is the first installment of $90 million that Qatar has pledged to cover the salaries of thousands of unpaid Hamas employees for six months.\n\nIsraeli opposition figures lambasted Netanyahu for appearing to cave in to violence. Army Radio played decade-old sound clips of Netanyahu, from when he was the opposition leader, threatening tough action against Hamas and criticizing his predecessor for being too soft.\n\nEven his erstwhile allies attacked him for indirectly doing business with a militant group that has fought three wars against Israel and is sworn to Israel's destruction.\n\n\"Everyone knows where that money is going to go ultimately,\" said Netanyahu's agriculture minister, Uri Ariel.\n\nBut in comments to reporters before traveling to Paris, Netanyahu said it was a \"question of alternatives.\" He said the step was coordinated with security officials to restore quiet for Israeli citizens living near the Gaza border and to avert a humanitarian crisis.\n\nLater, at a press conference in Paris, when asked about his longer-term vision for Gaza, Netanyahu said there could be no political resolution as long as Hamas is in power.\n\n\"You can't have a political resolution with those who are committed to your dissolution, to your destruction. That's absurd,\" he said. The alternative is to \"do the minimal things necessary to maintain our security and to prevent the collapse of the humanitarian situation,\" he added.\n\nThe payment is part of what is expected to be a set of informal understandings between Israel and Hamas reached through Egyptian and U.N. mediation.\n\nHamas is demanding an expansion of the permissible fishing zone off the Israeli-controlled Gaza coast, uninterrupted flow of fuel to mitigate chronic power shortages and the lifting of Israeli restrictions on exports and imports. In return, Israel wants quiet and an end to the border protests.\n\nFor the second week in a row, the Palestinians kept Friday's protests carefully restrained, burning fewer tires and refraining from breaching the fence.\n\nIn the West Bank, Abbas angrily accused Israel and the U.S. of ganging up behind his back to entrench Hamas' control over Gaza. He also accused Hamas of undermining his goal of establishing an independent Palestinian state that includes all of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\n\nAbbas fears that the U.S. is preparing to float a peace plan, called the \"Deal of the Century\" by President Donald Trump, which would leave Hamas in control of Gaza and give him only limited autonomy in pieces of the West Bank.\n\n\"We are going to take tough measures (against Hamas) in the coming days,\" Abbas said.\n\n\"There is an American conspiracy, which is the 'Deal of the Century,' and there is an Israeli conspiracy to implement the 'Deal of the Century,'\" he said. \"To my dismay, there is another conspiracy from Hamas to foil the independent state.\"\n\nAbbas, speaking at a ceremony marking the 14th anniversary of the death of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, did not elaborate on what steps he might take against Hamas.\n\nAbbas has repeatedly limited financial aid to Gaza in order to pressure Hamas into returning control to him.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Josef Federman reported in Jerusalem and AP writer Fares Akram reported from Gaza City, Gaza Strip.", "British police say a man has been arrested after a thief stole a marked police van from the police department parking lot.\n\nSuffolk Police said Sunday the police van had been taken from Lowestoft police station 160 miles (more than 250 kilometers) northeast of London on Saturday evening.\n\nIt was found after it had been abandoned 15 miles (25 kilometers) away in Bungay early Sunday.\n\nThe 27-year-old suspect is from Bungay and is being questioned. He hasn't been charged or identified.", "An Iranian appeals court has upheld the 10-year prison sentence of a former Foreign Ministry official convicted of spying.\n\nThe semi-official Fars news agency on Sunday quoted judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejehi as saying the court upheld Kamal Amirbeig's sentence and fined him $200,000. The report did not provide further information.\n\nIran rarely discloses the names or occupations of alleged spies.\n\nAuthorities have jailed several dual nationals in recent years on espionage charges. Rights groups have criticized those detentions, suggesting hard-liners in the judiciary are jailing Iranians with Western passports to use them as bargaining chips.\n\nThe U.S. and Israel both view Iran as a regional menace, and are believed to have carried out past intelligence operations targeting its nuclear program.", "In three years, the Uber Eats restaurant food delivery service has grown from an experiment to serving much of the U.S. and major cities worldwide.\n\nBy year's end, the ride-hailing company says it will cover 70 percent of the U.S. population and be in 243 metro areas, mainly by expanding into smaller cities. It's already in over 300 cities in 36 countries with many international deliveries done by bicycle.\n\nJason Droege, an Uber vice president who leads Uber Everything, the unit that explores how to build new businesses off the Uber network, says Eats is growing as fast as the ride-hailing service did in its early days. He talks about the future of the service and demand for getting food delivered to your home. Questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ: Is there a particular demographic group that uses Uber Eats?\n\nA: Certainly younger generations use it more. It's more like how they eat. I think there's a convenience premium for people who are coming of age now versus people who already have their habits set. If you look back, fast casual was something that was just getting going when I was 10, 11 years old. My generation is very used to going to a restaurant and doing take out, versus maybe the previous generation might have been used to 'hey, let's go get groceries.' Take out has been on the rise ever since the mid- to late-80s. Now you have a generation who wants the additional convenience. Maybe they want to stay home and watch Netflix, or use social media, or they want the access to hundreds of restaurants.\n\nQ: What kind of range do you serve from a customer's home?\n\nA: We want to make sure that the food arrives hot and delicious. If the food is in the car too long, that's bad. It's more about the time than it is about the business because we want that experience to be high quality. Uber has always believed that the faster you can get your ride, or your food, changes how consumers think about the level of convenience. So we've been focused from the beginning on getting food delivery from 40 to 45 minutes (from the order time) down to, I think our global average is now 31 minutes. Usually when people are ordering they're hungry. So we see that people use the product more when it's delivered faster, so we focus a lot on speed.\n\nQ: How did you know that people would want more than pizza delivered to their home, was it testing?\n\nA: Sometimes we do tests and they work, sometimes we do tests and they didn't work. Uber historically has done stunts. Uber ice cream, where we delivered ice cream on demand for a few years, or there was Uber puppies and Uber kittens, where a car would roll up and you'd play with some kittens in the back. We did those actually very locally. One common thread you saw is when a city, like the city of Fresno put on the local barbecue spot that was hard to get to, had really long lines, you saw a lot of demand. From the early days, we noticed that when we put popular restaurants on Uber and delivered them on demand, those are some of our most consistently successful stunts. Even in our marketing promotions we saw food and Uber had some connectivity. So we had some signal, but experimentation is what really pushed us there.\n\nQ: Is Eats a profit-making entity?\n\nA: We're focused on growth now, so we're investing aggressively. We feel really good about the economics of the business. Before we went into expansion, we actually got to a point where we saw the path to profitability, which is why we decided to invest aggressively.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Tom Krisher: https://twitter.com/tkrisher", "In \"Pass It On,\" AP beat reporters ask executives to share experiences and insights that will resonate with anyone managing a business.\n\nJason Droege is a vice president of Uber and head of Uber Everything, the unit that is trying to create more businesses to run on the ride-hailing service's network.\n\nHis biggest venture thus far is Uber Eats, a fast-growing restaurant food delivery service that by the end of the year will be within reach of 70 percent of the U.S. population. The 3-year-old service is in more than 300 metro cities across 36 countries.\n\nQ: What advice would you give your younger self about managing people or running a business? What did you learn from your early mistakes?\n\nA: Listening to your customers earlier. Entrepreneurs can get wedded to an idea. Your customers ultimately control the success of your business, and if you listen to them early and without any of your own biases on the world, you're probably going to get to the product that satisfies their needs sooner.\n\nQ: What have you learned about problem-solving over the years? What are the keys to tackling your most difficult challenges?\n\nA: You can solve it yourself and you're going to be very limited, or you can solve it in a group and provide an environment where people can help you solve the problem. You're going to get to a more optimal answer than if you do it yourself.\n\nQ: How much do you pay attention to your competition, and what do you try to learn from them?\n\nA: We're aware of competition but we don't focus on it. From the very beginning we had our own perspective on where we thought food could go. We've been focused on speed, we've been focused on convenience.\n\nQ: What key things can a manager do in terms of workplace culture that separate a mediocre business from a high-performing one?\n\nA: You invest a lot of time and energy recruiting high-quality people to come work on your team. You just want to make sure those people can bring their experiences, their intellect, their perspective to the table, and then contribute to the overall collective mindset of the business.\n\nQ: How do you manage work-life balance?\n\nA: You just have to figure out what your priorities are. For me personally, if I take care of myself and my family, those two things can help support my work. I don't know that it's as much balance as much as it is healthy integration.", "Russia's Foreign Ministry is complaining that the interrogation of a website editor at a U.S. airport shows authorities are persecuting Russian journalists.\n\nAlexander Malkevich, editor of the USA Really website, reportedly was detained and questioned for several hours Friday at a Washington airport and told that his site must register in the U.S. as a foreign agent.

On Sunday, he listened as he was lectured on the dangers of nationalist isolation, and then he headed home just as the inaugural Paris Peace Summit was getting under way.\n\nThe visit made clear that, nearly two years after taking office, Trump has dramatically upended decades of American foreign policy posture, shaking allies. That includes French President Emmanuel Macron, who on Sunday warned that the \"ancient demons\" that caused World War I and millions of deaths were once again making headway.\n\nMacron, who has been urging a re-embrace of multinational organizations and cooperation that have been shunned by Trump, delivered a barely-veiled rebuke of Trumpism at the weekend's centerpiece event: A gathering of dozens of leaders at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the base of the Arc de Triomphe to mark the passage of a century since the guns fell silent in a global war that killed millions. Bells tolled across Europe's Western Front and fighter jets passed overhead to mark the exact moment the devastating war came to a close.\n\nWith Trump and other leaders looking on, Macron took on the rising tide of populism in the United States and Europe and urged leaders not to turn their backs by turning inward.\n\n\"Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism: Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,\" Macron said, adding that, when nations put their interests first and decide \"who cares about the others\" they \"erase the most precious thing a nation can have... Its moral values.\"\n\nAfter Trump was gone, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who recently announced that she will not be seeking re-election, made an impassioned plea for global cooperation at the peace forum, saying World War I had \"made clear what disastrous consequences a lack of compromise in politics and diplomacy can have.\"\n\nTrump, who has made clear that he has limited patience for broad, multilateral agreements, sat mostly stone-faced as he listened to Macron, who sees himself as Europe's foil to the rising nationalist sentiment, which has taken hold in Hungary and Poland among other countries.\n\nTrump did engage with his fellow leaders, attending a group welcome dinner hosted by Macron at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay on Saturday night and a lunch on Sunday. He also spent time with Macron on Saturday, when the two stressed their shared desire for more burden-sharing during a quick availability with reporters.\n\nBut Trump was terse during some of his private conversations with world leaders, according to people with direct knowledge of his visit. One of the people described the president as \"grumpy.\" They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations.\n\nThe symbolism during Trump's visit couldn't have been more stark.\n\nTrump was missing from one of the weekend's most powerful images: A line of world leaders, walking shoulder to-shoulder in a somber, rain-soaked procession as the bells marking the exact moment that fighting ended \u2014 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918 \u2014 finished tolling.\n\nThe president and first lady Melania Trump had traveled to the commemoration separately \u2014 White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited security protocols \u2014 from the other dignitaries, who had traveled together by bus from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nAs Trump's motorcade was making its solo trip down the grand Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, which was closed to traffic, at least one topless woman breached tight security, running into the street and shouting \"fake peace maker\" as the cars passed. She had slogans, including the words \"Fake\" and \"Peace,\" written on her chest.\n\nPolice tackled the woman and the motorcade continued uninterrupted. The feminist activist group Femen later claimed responsibility.\n\nAlso traveling on his own was Russian President Vladimir Putin, who shook Trump's hand, flashed him a thumbs-up sign and patted Trump's arm as he arrived. Trump responded with a wide smile.\n\nNational Security Adviser John Bolton had said at one point that Putin and Trump would meet in Paris, but they will instead hold a formal sit-down later this month at a world leaders' summit in Buenos Aires. A Kremlin official said later that U.S. and Russian officials decided to drop plans for the Paris meeting after French officials objected.\n\nTrump, who ran on an \"America First\" platform, has jarred European allies with his actions. He has slapped tariffs on the European Union, pulled the U.S. out of the landmark Paris Climate Accord and the Iran nuclear deal and suggested he might be willing to pull the U.S. out of NATO if member counties don't significantly boost their defense spending. Trump's eagerness to get along with the Russian leader \u2014 in spite of Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and numerous other aggressive moves in recent years \u2014 has alarmed those who view Russia as a growing threat.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly branded himself a \"nationalist,\" despite criticism from some that the term has negative connotations. At a news conference last week, Trump defended his use of the phrase. \"You know what the word is? I love our country,\" he said, adding: \"You have nationalists. You have globalists. I also love the world and I don't mind helping the world, but we have to straighten out our country first. We have a lot of problems.\"\n\nBut Trump did not broach the divide as he paid tribute Sunday to U.S. and allied soldiers killed in World War I during \"a horrible, horrible war\" that marked America's emergence as a world power.\n\n\"We are gathered together at this hallowed resting place to pay tribute to the brave Americans who gave their last breath in that mighty struggle,\" Trump said at the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial in the suburbs of Paris, where more than 1,500 Americans who died in the war are buried.\n\n\"It is our duty to preserve the civilization they defended and to protect the peace they so nobly gave their lives to secure one century ago,\" he said after spending a moment, standing alone amid the cemetery's white crosses, holding a black umbrella.\n\nThe Veterans Day speech came a day after Trump was criticized for failing to visit a different American cemetery about 60 miles (100 kilometers) outside of Paris on Saturday because rain grounded the helicopter he had planned to take. A handful of senior administration officials, including White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, went in the president's place, while Trump remained behind at the ambassador's residence with no alternate schedule for hours.\n\nTrump delivered the speech as other leaders were gathered for the inaugural Paris Peace Forum, which aims to revive collective governance and international cooperation to tackle global challenges. Afterward he headed back to Washington.\n\nFrance was the epicenter of World War I, the first global conflict. Its role as host of the main international commemoration highlighted the point that the world mustn't stumble into war again, as it did so quickly and catastrophically with World War II.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Robert Burns and Julie Pace in Washington and Lori Hinnant and Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press' WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Superville and Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/dsupervilleap and https://twitter.com/colvinj", "Interest Successfully Added\n\nWe'll notify you here with news about AlertTag\n\nTurn on desktop notifications for breaking stories about interest?", "Afghan officials say the Taliban have attacked a small army base, killing 12 members of the security forces and leaving behind explosives that killed four tribal elders who had come to help collect the bodies.\n\nSafder Mohsini, head of provincial council in the northern Baghlan province, says the insurgents abducted two soldiers and wounded three others in the attack, which began late Saturday.

The camp's flag has a falanga, a far-right symbol dating to the 1930s of a stylized hand with a sword.\n\nThere were also a few flags of Forza Nuova, an Italian group whose leader, Roberto Fiore, describes himself as fascist. One of the organizers of the march, Krzysztof Bosak, insisted that Forza Nuova are nationalists who are in touch with the Polish group.\n\nAmong the slogans that participants shouted were \"USA, empire of evil\" and \"Poland, white and Catholic.\" Members of one nationalist group, eurosceptic All-Polish Youth, burned a European Union flag. An EU flag was also burned at another nationalist rally in Wroclaw. The city's mayor dissolved the march by nationalists toward its end, during speeches by far-right leaders.\n\nOver the past decade, nationalist organizations have held Independence Day marches in Warsaw on Nov. 11 that have included racist slogans, flares and in some years, acts of aggression.\n\nSunday's was by far the largest Independence Day march to date, and it was mostly peaceful. Government spokeswoman Joanna Kopcinska called it \"the biggest march of free Poles in a free Poland.\"\n\nThis year, in honor of the centennial, state officials sought to hold one big government-led march for Sunday's ceremonies. At first, negotiations broke down over requests for the radical groups to leave banners at home, but an agreement on a joint march was reached on Friday.\n\n\"Let this be our joint march, let it be a march for everyone, a march where everyone wants to be and feels good, marching for Poland,\" Duda said at the start of the march.\n\nDuda and the government faced criticism from liberal opposition politicians for their willingness to negotiate with nationalists, including some who have made anti-Semitic comments in the past. After some individuals showed up with extremist emblems, the state officials \u2014 surrounded by security \u2014 appeared to try to keep some distance from the nationalists, marching ahead of them on the same route.\n\nThroughout the day, observances, Masses, marathons and fireworks were held in cities and small towns to commemorate the nation's statehood regained at the end of World War I, after 123 years of foreign rule.\n\nThe national flag fluttered from buildings, buses and cars, while dignitaries and regular citizens placed flowers at memorials to the father of Polish independence, Marshal Jozef Pilsudski. The historic Sigismund Bell, reserved only for the most important national events, rang out over Krakow.\n\nMarch participant Bartlomiej Mazur, 23, who travelled 320 kilometers (200 miles) to the capital, said he wanted to show that \"Poland is a strong, proud nation.

The daughter of a combat Vietnam veteran who served in 1969 until 1970 in areas that were the most heavily sprayed with Agent Orange, Kuhn said most of her life she struggled with neurogenic stomach and bowel issues that were often misdiagnosed.\n\nHer father years later would later be diagnosed with several heart conditions and diabetes all related to Agent Orange exposure.\n\nAngelica Caye Kuhn\n\nKuhn eventually received her nursing license and went back to work, but her career was short-lived. Since then, she has had 28 different surgeries and is now legally disabled.\n\n\"I am a hostage and a prisoner,\" she wrote in an email to ABC News. \"Imprisoned by my handicap. All because of a KNOWN toxic chemical that was dumped on my unsuspecting father and millions of other unsuspecting members of our military, who have/are paying with their lives and the lives of their children!!!\"\n\nMore than 40 years after the end of the Vietnam War, children of the men and women who served say they are battling a new war for benefits as they grapple with the impact of toxic exposure which has wreaked havoc on their lives.\n\nAgent Orange is a term that is used to describe a series of odorless herbicides that were used by the military to defoliate hiding places, fields and rice paddies that were used by the Viet Cong for survival.\n\nAlmost 20 million gallons of Agent Orange was sprayed in Vietnam, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nThe chemical was also used at several U.S. military posts in America, Southeast Asia, and Canada, according to the agency.\n\nJose Luis Magana/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEarlier this year, the agency recognized publicly for the first time that some service members were exposed to dioxin because C-123\u2019s that were used to spray the Agent Orange was still being used by the Air Force and Air Force reserves in the U.S. until 1986.\n\nFive years after the C-123\u2019s were taken out of service, \"The Agent Orange Act\" passed in Congress allowing returning men and women to receive medical compensation for their illnesses.\n\nThe VA declared specific conditions ranging from diabetes to cancer, directly tied to presumptive exposure to Agent Orange and dioxin.\n\nThe VA recognized over a dozen medical conditions for children of women who served in of Vietnam. However, for the children of the men who served in Vietnam, only Spina Bifida is recognized as being directly connected to Agent Orange exposure.\n\nThe VA did not respond to ABC News' multiple requests for comment.\n\nIn 2017, Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., introduced legislation in Congress to allow the VA to recognize more medical conditions from children and grandchildren of male veterans. The bill is still being considered but hasn\u2019t gone to a vote.\n\nThe Vietnam Veterans of America, a nonprofit, has been advocating for decades for the government to assist veterans with issues as it relates to Agent Orange and has held over 300 town halls on the issue.\n\nTheir project Faces of Agent Orange focuses on children and grandchildren of both male and female veterans with filing claims with the VA.\n\nThe group says they are attempting to help the government have an accurate database on the long-term effects of the chemical exposure.\n\n\u201cYou can't review science that doesn't exist and nobody was funding the science on the children the grandchildren,\u201d said Mokie Porter, the communications director for the Vietnam Veterans of America.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. announced that it had completed a clean up the dioxin saturated soil the area surrounding Da Nang Airport, an area heavily sprayed with Agent Orange according to Vietnamese and American officials.\n\nAnd in October, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis traveled to Vietnam to visit Bien Hoa Air Base a spot that is undergoing a $390 million soil restoration project headed by U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nThe Vietnamese claim that 4 million people were exposed to Agent Orange and 3 million of its people suffer from medical conditions that were caused by the exposure from the Vietnam War.\n\nDespite the efforts to decontaminate the soil, the U.S. vehemently denies that the number of Agent Orange illnesses are that high, which according to the Vietnamese includes children of men and women who were exposed to the dioxin following the war.\n\nBetty Mekdeci, the executive director of Birth Defect Research for Children, a Florida-based non-profit says she\u2019s collected data since 1986 on birth defects from toxic exposure. Because more men served in Vietnam, Mekdeci says she has received more data specifically showing birth defects in the descendants of male veterans.\n\nHer organization has collected data from nearly 10,000 veterans, 2,000 children of Vietnam veterans and 300 grandchildren of veterans. Many of the medical conditions she\u2019s seen in grandchildren of veterans aren\u2019t physical.\n\nMekdeci says she\u2019s seen issues with ovaries, endocrine, learning and attention deficit disorders and cancer.\n\n\u201cWe don't have ten years to look at these things. These kids are having problems right now and we need to get on it right now not ten years from now.\u201d She says that the scientific community should focus on assisting children of veterans instead of studying them.\n\nAngelica Caye Kuhn\n\nKuhn, who is an administrator of a Facebook group for second and third generation children with Agent Orange exposure, says many of her fellow members are suffering from rare medical conditions \u201cit\u2019s happening to us in droves.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always things that aren\u2019t normal,\" she said. With my condition, the doctor will tell you that it is something so rare that you hardly see it.\u201d\n\nKuhn said she applied for VA benefits in 2000 and was granted only partial benefits. She appealed the VA\u2019s decision saying that she met the criteria and was legally disabled.\n\nKuhn says after a call to the Denver VA office of Spina Bifida, a VA employee asked if she was able to feed herself. Kuhn says after replied, yes, she says the VA employee said since she could feed herself, she didn\u2019t need any additional help from them.\n\nKuhn says she has appealed the VA\u2019s ruling and has successfully won twice but has been denied seven years of back pay.\n\nKuhn said she often relies on wheelchairs and canes to move around and because her husband works to support her family she is often alone at home.\n\nShe says the VA has denied her request pay for a stair lift so she can be mobile in their two-story home and has denied her request for hand controls so she can drive her car. Kuhn says that although she is entitled to VA social worker due to her condition, she has yet to receive one and currently doesn\u2019t have a home health aid despite numerous requests.\n\nKuhn\u2019s family members say they have also suffered medical problems.\n\nHer mother developed a rare blood condition and was diagnosed with a toxic liver. And Kuhn's daughter suffers from a connective tissue disorder.\n\nUnder the VA guidelines, Kuhn\u2019s daughter would not be covered for VA benefits because her grandfather was a male veteran who served in Vietnam.\n\nDr. Kenneth Ramos, the chairman of 2014 Congressionally mandated report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine on Veterans and Agent Orange, says that the majority of the generational studies done by the scientific community regarding agent orange has been focused on women and not men.\n\nRamos says that changes in technology will help answer questions on transgenerational inheritance. But it won\u2019t answer all of the questions right away.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge that you face with current generational inheritance is the length of time that it takes for you to see the facts,\u201d he said in order to fully study the impact on future generations research would have to be started from scratch.\n\nDr. Michael Skinner, with Washington State University\u2019s Center for Reproductive biology, has studied the transgenerational health effects of dioxin exposure using animals and says women who served in Vietnam and was exposed to Agent Orange could have passed the dioxin to children for at least 15 to 20 years after they returned home.\n\n\u201cThe problem with dioxin or Agent Orange is that it stays in the system for a very long period of time.\u201d\n\nHe also says through his research he\u2019s seen dioxin passed through sperm to the offspring in animals. His concern is not with the veterans who returned home or their children, but with their grandchildren.\n\n\u201cWe have examples where there is no disease in the first generation but there's huge numbers of disease and the third generation,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Thursday, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine will release their report as a part of the congressionally mandated biennial reviews of the evidence of health problems that may be linked to exposure to Agent Orange and other herbicides used during the Vietnam War.\n\nThe report will address \u201cpossible generational health effects that may be the result of herbicide exposure among male Vietnam veterans\u201d according to the organization. The Vietnam Veterans of America, however, says regardless of the outcome of the report they will continue to educate and advocate for its members and their descendants.\n\nIn the meantime, Kuhn said she'll continue to push for awareness.\n\n\"It's been a nightmare,\" Kuhn said and vowed to continue fighting for awareness. \"You have to fight them because if you don't they will run over you big time and a lot of people you know they just give up and walk away and you can't do that.\"", "When Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush\u2019s Grammy-winning country band Sugarland went on hiatus over five years ago, they knew it wasn\u2019t the end.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating, people\u2019s connection to drama and scandal, and wanting to say that it was a breakup. It was never that,\u201d Nettles said in an interview for the ABC special, \u201cCountry Music\u2019s Biggest Stars: In the Spotlight with Robin Roberts.\" \u201cWe wanted to go fill our cups with new things, you know?\u201d\n\nDuring their time apart, Nettles gave birth to her first child, Magnus, who just started kindergarten this year.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make sure that I could be available and present for him. What a big transition. What a page turn, man,\u201d Nettles said. \u201cI think it was harder for me than it was for him...we\u2019ve spent so much time together, and then now suddenly, he\u2019s in school all day. And it\u2019s like, he will be doing that for 13 years. What?\u201d\n\nC Flanigan/FilmMagic/Getty Images\n\nBack together touring again, Sugarland has since released their new album titled, \u201cBigger,\u201d and are back on tour. Although it had been a while since they shared a studio together, Nettles and Bush said they know they could count on their trust for each other creatively.\n\n\u201cSometimes we have more trust for each other than we do ourselves,\u201d Nettles said.\n\n\u201cWe do,\u201d added Bush.\n\n\u201cYou know, those kinds of things where sometimes you can get in your own way, but if you have someone to bounce off of that you trust, that can really, I think, speed up the process,\u201d said Nettles.\n\nTheir latest single, \u201cBabe,\u201d features Taylor Swift, who started out around the same time Bush and Nettles did and was a fan of Sugarland.\n\n\u201cWe did a little independent EP called 'Premium Quality Tunes' that we put together,\u201d Nettles said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I even have one of those,\u201d Bush said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I do either. She has it and has kept it,\u201d Nettles said.\n\nMatt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images\n\nNettles said that when Swift heard Sugarland might be doing another tour and record, she reached out to offer them the song \u201cBabe.\u201d The music video for the song is nominated for Music Video of the Year at this year's CMA Awards, and Sugarland is also nominated for Vocal Duo of the Year.\n\nSugarland has come a long way since Aug. 13, 2011, the day the stage at their concert at the Indiana State Fair collapsed, killing seven people and injuring dozens.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all big to take in. Thankfully, we are in a place now where we can be human about it. At that time, we weren\u2019t allowed to talk about it,\u201d Nettles said. \u201cThat was very challenging because we weren\u2019t able to be human about it for our own protection, just because of the nature of the legalities.\u201d\n\nThe duo said making music and performing has been healing for both them and their fans.\n\n\u201cIt feels so good to hug them and for them to stand in front of us and go, 'Look, we\u2019re still here,'\u201d Bush said.\n\n\u201cYou have to understand, this was something that we all experienced together. We had crew who were injured,\u201d Nettles said. \u201cThe whole thing was quite traumatic, and even recently on this tour, we did an outside gig. And it was very rainy, and it was very, very windy. And I had basically a PTSD moment where I just like ... I grabbed [Bush\u2019s] hand and just drew him over to the side and said, \u2018I am like, freaking out right now, so I have to get this together.\u2019\u201d\n\nJoey Foley/Getty Images\n\nIn the investigation that followed the accident, Bush said much of the band\u2019s gear, including their instruments that were smashed in the collapse, remained on the stage. Eventually, some of the remnants of the broken instruments were delivered to Bush\u2019s home.\n\n\u201cI opened up the cardboard box that came to the front door, and I realized what it was after I had totally torn out the stuffing of whatever the protective stuff was, and I was like, \u2018Oh.\u2019 It just -- I couldn\u2019t take it,\u201d Bush recalled.\n\nBush said he had to explain to his kids what happened at the show, and that it was his daughter who helped him in his emotional moment after receiving the box of broken instruments.\n\n\u201cI just left the box there, and she, my daughter, is some sort of angel person. She pulled the stuff out, and there were these broken pieces. She\u2019s like, \u2018Look Dad, I can make something awesome out of this,\u2019 and it was a big old peace sign on the floor,\u201d Bush said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Of course they will save us. Our children will save us.\u2019\u201d\n\nNettles and Bush said they don\u2019t know exactly what's next for Sugarland, and are also focused on other aspects of their careers and personal lives.\n\n\u201cThere will always be Sugarland. I love it, you love it, the fans love it, so there will always be that. What\u2019s specifically next is getting Magnus into school comfortably and sleeping. That\u2019s specifically next,\u201d Nettles said.\n\n\u201cYeah, I got to go home and start producing records, I think, until we decided to do this. I think I got another Lindsay Ell record to do. There\u2019s just all sorts of things. I don\u2019t know. We like making stuff. We\u2019ll always make stuff,\u201d said Bush.\n\nNettles and Bush said the thing that time apart has shown them is how much they\u2019ve evolved.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think that her singing could be better, but it has gotten better,\u201d Bush said.\n\n\u201cBeing able to see how Kristian has evolved in terms of a writer and a producer and to get to experience the benefits of that as his partner on this record in what we wrote and how we wrote it was so rewarding for me, not only to experience, but also to get to see, and to know, \u2018Yeah, this time apart was good for us in this way,\u2019\u201d Nettles said.", "The U.S. military says American and Iraqi forces killed more than 50 Islamic State militants, including several commanders, in northern Iraq last month.\n\nU.S. Central Command said Sunday that an Oct. 30 operation in Salahuddin province killed five IS leaders and more than 30 other militants, and that an operation the following day in the Makhmour Mountains killed around 20 IS fighters.

Kearsey says his father, Bill, survived thanks to a friend who pulled him from a trench.\n\nKearsey said the rain that fell during the ceremony attended by dozens of world leaders for armistice centenary \"is very fitting\" since soldiers who fought in trenches during the Great War endured miserable rain and mud.\n\nHe added: \"It's raining today, 100 years later.\"\n\nThe Kearsey family also is touring WWI battlefields during their trip.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n12:30 p.m.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is warning against the dangers of nationalism in a speech aimed directly at the rising tide of populism in the United States and Europe.\n\nWith U.S. President Donald Trump and other world leaders looking on during an Armistice Day centennial observance in Paris on Sunday, Macron said the \"ancient demons\" that caused World War I and millions of deaths are growing stronger.\n\nThe French leader said: \"Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism. Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism. In saying 'Our interests first, whatever happens to the others,' you erase the most precious thing a nation can have, that which makes it live, that which causes it to be great and that which is most important: Its moral values.\"\n\nTrump has proudly declared himself a nationalist.

Fighter jets passed overhead as the leaders walked to the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nAt 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918, the devastating war came to a close.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin were expected to arrive separately for the commemorations.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n11 a.m.\n\nWorld leaders have missed the exact moment to commemorate the armistice that ended World War I.\n\nAs bells rang across Europe's Western Front, U.S. President Donald Trump headed toward the Arc de Triomphe as did buses filled with world leaders, but they were running late.\n\nMany of the leaders, holding black umbrellas, stood in a line short of the monument.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n10:55 a.m.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump is headed to the Arc de Triomphe on the Champs-Elysees. World leaders were following several minutes later in commemorations to mark 100 years since the moment World War I drew to an end.\n\nPresidents and other dignitaries left the French presidential palace in buses, just a few minutes before the ceremony was supposed to begin at the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nTrump headed separately to the memorial for security reasons, as did Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe war ended at precisely 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918 and Sunday's ceremonies were intended to drive home the disaster that would befall the world should it stumble into another global war.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n10:35 a.m.\n\nEuropean Council head Donald Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, is celebrating the 100th anniversary of Poland's independence by laying wreaths at monuments to key figures in rebuilding the country's statehood after World War I.\n\nTusk placed flowers at the monument to the first state and armed forces leader, Marshal Jozef Pilsudski, by the Belvedere Palace where Pilsudski resided.\n\nTusk, an opponent of Poland's right-wing government, said the political disputes about Poland's future are \"sometime too strong\" but stressed that \"our bond is much stronger and much more important, because it is you, Poland.\"\n\nHe will also take part at a noon state ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n9:50 a.m.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte are welcoming dozens of world leaders at the French presidential palace before a ceremony in Paris marking Armistice Day.\n\nAmong dignitaries arriving are Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nMost of the heads of states and government will take a bus together to the nearby Arc de Triomphe to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.\n\nOthers will go to the monument on their own for security reasons, including U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n9:30 a.m.\n\nNothing is left to chance in the seating of world leaders at the Arc de Triomphe commemoration of the end of World War I.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron will be seated between his wife and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Russian President Vladimir Putin will sit to the left of Brigitte Macron, while President Donald Trump and his wife will be next to Merkel.\n\nAmong others facing them Sunday will be the French prime minister, the president of France's legislative body, and Spanish King Felipe VI.\n\nRain threatens, but all the leaders will be beneath a canopy as they commemorate the moment 100 years ago when the slaughter of World War I finally stopped.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n9 a.m.\n\nPoland is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its rebirth as an independent state with a multitude of events across the country, including marches and the national hymn being sung publicly in more than 600 towns.\n\nPoland regained its independence at the end of World War I in 1918, reborn from the ashes of three defeated powers that had partitioned and ruled the Central European nation for 123 years.\n\nThe ceremonies in Poland coincide with world leaders gathering in Paris on Sunday to mark the armistice of what was then called the Great War.\n\nPoland's regained independence fulfilled the dreams of generations of patriots who had kept the language and culture alive despite foreign rule and repression. Yet Poland was to be invaded and occupied yet again in the 20th century\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n8:50 a.m.\n\nCommemorations are underway around the world to mark the moment 100 years ago when the slaughter of World War I finally stopped.\n\nFrance, the epicenter of the first global conflict, was hosting the main international commemoration, pressing home the point that the world mustn't stumble into war again, as it did so quickly and catastrophically with World War II\n\nThe more than 60 world leaders scheduled to gather at precisely 11 a.m., a century after the cease-fire, included those with the power to destroy humanity if it ever stumbled into the folly of a World War III.\n\nThe U.S. and Russian presidents were being joined by an array of leaders whose geographical spread showed how the \"war to end all wars\" left few corners of the globe untouched.", "World leaders with the power to make war but a duty to preserve peace solemnly marked the end of World War I's slaughter 100 years ago at commemorations Sunday that drove home the message \"never again\" but also exposed the globe's new political fault lines.\n\nAs Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and dozens of other heads of state and government listened in silence, French President Emmanuel Macron used the occasion, as its host, to sound a powerful and sobering warning about the fragility of peace and the dangers of nationalism and of nations that put themselves first, above the collective good.\n\n\"The old demons are rising again, ready to complete their task of chaos and of death,\" Macron said.\n\n\"Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism. Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,\" he said. \"In saying 'Our interests first, whatever happens to the others,' you erase the most precious thing a nation can have, that which makes it live, that which causes it to be great and that which is most important: Its moral values.\"\n\nTrump, ostensibly the main target of Macron's message, sat stony-faced. The American president has proudly declared himself a nationalist. But if Trump felt singled out by Macron's remarks, he didn't show it. He later described the commemoration as \"very beautiful.\"\n\nAs well as spelling out the horrific costs of conflict to those with arsenals capable of waging a World War III, the ceremony also served up a joyful reminder of the intense sweetness of peace, when high school students read from letters that soldiers and civilians wrote 100 years ago when guns finally fell silent on the Western Front.\n\nBrought alive again by people too young to have known global war themselves, the ghostly voices seemed collectively to say: Please, do not make our mistakes.\n\n\"I only hope the soldiers who died for this cause are looking down upon the world today,\" American soldier Capt. Charles S. Normington wrote on Nov. 11, 1918, in one of the letters. \"The whole world owes this moment of real joy to the heroes who are not here to help enjoy it.\"\n\nThe Paris weather \u2014 gray and damp \u2014 seemed aptly fitting when remembering a war fought in mud and relentless horror.\n\nThe commemorations started late, overshooting the centenary of the exact moment when, 100 years earlier at 11 a.m., an eerie silence replaced the thunder of war on the front lines. Macron recalled that 1 billion shells fell on France alone from 1914-1918 .\n\nAs bells marking the armistice hour rang across Paris and in many nations ravaged by the four years of carnage, Macron and other leaders were still on their way to the centennial site at the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nUnder a sea of black umbrellas, a line of leaders led by Macron and his wife, Brigitte, marched in silence on the cobbles of the Champs-Elysees, after dismounting from their buses.\n\nTrump arrived separately, in a motorcade that drove past three topless protesters with anti-war slogans on their chests who somehow got through the rows of security and were quickly bundled away by police. The Femen group claimed responsibility. French authorities said the three women faced charges of sexual exhibitionism. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited security protocols for the presidential motorcade's solo trip down the grand flag-lined avenue, which was closed to traffic.\n\nLast to arrive was the Russian president, Putin, who shook Trump's hand and flashed him a thumbs-up. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was positioned in pride of place between Trump and Macron, an eloquent symbol of victors and vanquished now standing together, shoulder to shoulder. Overhead, fighter jets ripped through the sky, trailing red, white and blue smoke in homage to the French flag.\n\nThe geographical spread of the more than 60 heads of state and government who attended, silent and reflective, showed how the \"war to end all wars\" left few corners of the earth untouched but which, little more than two decades later, was followed so quickly and catastrophically by the even deadlier World War II.\n\nOn the other side of the globe, Australia and New Zealand held ceremonies to recall how the war killed and wounded soldiers and civilians in unprecedented numbers and in gruesome new, mechanized ways.\n\nThose countries lost tens of thousands of soldiers far away in Europe and, most memorably in the 1915 battle of Gallipoli, in Turkey. In central London, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, clad in black, watched from a balcony as her son Prince Charles laid a wreath on her behalf at the foot of the Cenotaph memorial that honors the fallen. Britain had 880,000 military dead in the war.\n\nThe gulf between Trump's \"America First\" credo and European leaders was starkly underscored again later Sunday, when Trump went his own way.\n\nHe visited an American cemetery outside Paris at precisely the moment that Macron, Merkel and other dignitaries were opening a peace forum where the French leader again sounded the alarm about crumbling international harmony as he ruminated about the legacy of the morning's commemorations.\n\n\"Will it be the shining symbol of durable peace between nations or will it be a picture of a last moment of unity before the world goes down in new disorder?\" Macron asked. \"It depends only on us.\"\n\nWhile praising France for \"a wonderful two days,\" Trump described his rainy stop at the American cemetery at Suresnes as \"the highlight of the trip.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Trump drew criticism for canceling a separate commemorative visit to the Belleau Wood battleground northeast of Paris because of rain.\n\nRemembered for brutal trench warfare and the first use of chemical weapons, WWI pitted the armies of France, the British empire, Russia and the U.S. against a German-led coalition that included the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires. Almost 10 million soldiers died, sometimes tens of thousands on a single day.\n\nThe U.S. came late to the war, in April 1917, but over 1\u00bd years it became a key player and tipped the scales for the allies. At the war's end, the U.S. had 2 million troops in Europe and another 2 million ready to cross the Atlantic if needed, a force that turned the United States into a major military power whose soldiers then fought and died again for Europe in World War II.\n\nEven though Germany was at the heart of provoking two world wars over the past century, the nation has become a beacon of European and international cooperation since.\n\nWith so many leaders in Paris, the commemoration also provoked a flurry of diplomacy on the sidelines, with conflict in Yemen and Syria among the hot-button issues.\n\nOn Sunday, Merkel met with the head of the United Nations, an organization born from the ashes of World War II, and the president of Serbia. It was a Serb teenager, Gavrilo Princip, who assassinated the Austro-Hungarian crown prince in Sarajevo in 1914 to set off events which led to the outbreak of war.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Angela Charlton, Sylvie Corbet, Elaine Ganley and Thomas Adamson contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press' WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition.

Investigators believe that this was an isolated incident and that the victims knew the suspects.\"\n\nShelby County Sheriff\u2019s Office\n\nIt is unclear if the shooter was among the injured. Buckner said at an earlier press conference they did not have any suspects.\n\nIdentities of the victims have not yet been confirmed, the sheriff's office said.", "Residents of the eastern Ukraine regions controlled by Russia-backed separatist rebels voted Sunday for local governments in elections denounced by Kiev and the West.\n\nThe elections were to choose heads of government and legislature members in the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, where separatists have fought Ukrainian forces since the spring of 2014 in a war that has killed more than 10,000 people.\n\nAlthough a 2015 accord on ending the war calls for local elections in Donetsk and Luhansk, critics including Ukraine's president, the U.S. and the European Union say the vote is illegitimate because it is conducted where Ukraine has no control.\n\nBut the separatists say the vote is a key step toward establishing full-fledged democracy in the regions.\n\n\"It's another exam for the civic position, political position for the whole Donetsk Republic,\" said Denis Pushilin, who became acting head of the Donetsk separatist regime since predecessor Alexander Zakharchenko was killed in a restaurant bombing in August.\n\nHis Luhansk counterpart, Leonid Pasechnik, said Sunday that \"we are a free republic, a free country\" and denied that the voting was being held contrary to the 2015 agreement signed in Minsk.\n\nLast week, the European Union condemned the elections as \"illegal and illegitimate ... they are in breach of international law, undermine the commitments taken under the Minsk agreements and violate Ukraine's sovereignty and law.\"\n\n\"These are elections for entities that have no legitimacy under the Ukrainian constitution,\" Kurt Volker, the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine, said last week.\n\n\"The people in eastern Ukraine will be better off within a unified Ukraine at peace rather than in a second-rate police state run by crooks and thugs, all subsidized by Russian taxpayers,\" he said Sunday on .\n\nBoth regions reported voter turnout of more than 70 percent as of two hours before the polls closed at 8 p.m. (1700 GMT).\n\nThe spokesman for Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said he discussed the elections with the leaders of Germany and France in Paris amid the ceremonies commemorating the end of World War I Sunday.\n\nGermany, France and Ukraine are part of the so-called \"Normandy format\" countries seeking a resolution to the conflict. Russia is the fourth country in the format, which has not held talks in two years.\n\nAndrei Yermolaev, an analyst at the New Ukraine think-tank in Kiev, said \"conducting the elections despite the opinions of Kiev and the West means that the Kremlin completely controls the situation in the region and intends to use this 'frozen conflict' as a lever of pressure on the Ukrainian authorities.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nJim Heintz in Moscow contributed to this story.", "The deaths of two young Saudi sisters, whose bodies washed up along the New York City waterfront last month, have shined a light on the often secretive and risky journeys Saudi women take to flee their homes, both within the kingdom and abroad.\n\nTala Farea, 16, and Rotana Farea, 23, ran away from home in Fairfax, Virginia before being placed in a shelter amid allegations they were abused at home. They then made their way to New York City, staying in high-end hotels and eventually maxing out the older sister's credit card.\n\nWhat happened next is still under investigation. Their bodies, fully clothed and showing no obvious signs of trauma, were found Oct. 24 along the rocky banks of the Hudson River wrapped together with tape.\n\nNew York City Police Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea said people who knew the Farea sisters in Virginia told investigators that they made statements within the last year indicating \"that they would rather inflict harm on themselves \u2014 commit suicide \u2014 than return to Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nThat may be because in Saudi Arabia, women who try and flee have few good options. Under the kingdom's guardianship system women must have the approval of a male relative \u2014 such as a father, husband, brother, or even a son \u2014 to marry, obtain a passport or travel.\n\n\"The fact that they continue to be subjected to the guardianship system ... to the more sort of sinister issues which include physical or sexual abuse that they face at home, we've seen women in all these cases attempt to flee,\" said Human Rights Watch researcher Adam Coogle.\n\nCoogle said there are also women being pressured into marriages against their will. He did not specifically discuss the Farea sisters as their case is still under investigation.\n\nIn other instances, women are being barred by their guardians from marrying or their salaries are being confiscated.\n\nIf women who run away are caught, they can be pressured to return home or placed in shelters where often the only way out is to escape again. Others are jailed and only a male guardian can sign for their release.\n\nLast year, Saudi women's rights activist Mariam al-Otaibi spent more than 100 days in the women's section of al-Malaz prison in Riyadh after her father filed a complaint to police against her for leaving home. She'd moved from the ultraconservative province of Qassim to the capital, where supporters helped her rent an apartment and find work.\n\nShe was released after her case attracted the attention of activists and rights groups.\n\nAlso last year, a plea for help by a 24-year-old Saudi woman triggered a firestorm on social media with people seeking details about her disappearance. In an online video, Dina Ali Lasloom said her passport was confiscated at an airport in the Philippines on her way to Australia where she planned to seek asylum.\n\nWomen's rights advocates in Saudi Arabia said Lasloom was ultimately forced to board a plane to the kingdom with two of her uncles, who flew from Riyadh to stop her. They said authorities then took her to a women's shelter because of the attention around her case. A Saudi woman who tried to meet Lasloom at the airport in Riyadh to assist her was detained for several days by authorities.\n\nA group of Saudi women's rights activists had raised money locally for runaways and were planning to start a non-governmental organization to shelter abused women. But in May, authorities arrested at least nine of them and three of their male supporters. They remain detained on vague charges related to national security.\n\nFor runaway Saudi women, fleeing can be a matter of life and death, and they are almost always doing so to escape male relatives.\n\nIt's a problem Saudi society is grappling with. State-aligned newspapers report when women flee shelters and articles question the level of care and support women receive at such facilities.\n\nThe shelters have been described by Saudi activists as prison-like. Women inside cannot freely access the internet or mobile phones, their movements are restricted and often the only way to leave is with the signature of a male guardian. The shelters say they offer women psychiatric care and therapy, but do not take in women who, for example, are pregnant out of wedlock. Premarital sex can lead to criminal prosecution in Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries.\n\nThe most recent statistics from the Ministry of Labor and Social Development show that 577 Saudi women tried to flee their homes in 2015. That figure is likely to be much higher in reality because many families don't report runaways due to social stigma.\n\nThe Farea sisters had moved to the U.S. from Saudi Arabia with their mother and two brothers in 2015. The father spent time between the two countries, according to Arab News, which spoke to a relative.\n\nInvestigators say they believe the Farea sisters had filed for asylum. One of the problems women face in seeking asylum, though, is proving abuse.\n\n\"You have to have evidence for it and unless you have a threatening text (message), you may not have a very good asylum case,\" said Coogle of Human Rights Watch.\n\nAfter the Farea sisters died, witness called police with something he said had been \"haunting\" him. He'd seen the sisters standing apart at Riverside Park in New York, with their heads bowed into their hands praying loudly hours before their bodies were found. Investigators have stopped short of saying the sisters killed themselves, but say they have \"no credible information that any crime took place.\"\n\nThe sisters' bodies were returned to Saudi Arabia on Nov. 3 and they were buried the same day in Medina \u2014 home to one of Islam's holiest sites where the Prophet Muhammad is buried.\n\n\"This is a tragedy all the way around,\" said Shea, the chief of detectives in New York.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Aya Batrawy on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ayaelb .", "Philippine prosecutors said Sunday they will file charges of tax evasion against a news website that has been critical of President Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nThe Justice Department said in a statement it found probable cause to indict Rappler Holdings Corp. and its president, journalist Maria Ressa.

The White House cited weather conditions that grounded the president's helicopter for the cancellation.\n\nIn the wake of criticism that Trump didn't travel by car to the event, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued a statement Sunday that noted the weather and \"near-zero visibility\" as well as concerns that a motorcade on short notice would have required closing substantial portions of area roadways.\n\n\"President Trump did not want to cause that kind of unexpected disruption to the city and its people,\" Sanders said.

It said that 5,771 of those departed Sunday morning after staying in three shelters it had prepared, the largest of which was a soccer stadium in the state capital.\n\nThose numbers appeared even higher than counts made by officials when the group was in Mexico City for several days, raising the possibility that other migrants had caught up to the main caravan.\n\nStarting out before dawn, the migrants went on to Irapuato, an agricultural city about 62 miles (100 kilometers) to the west in neighboring Guanajuato state, and set up camp around a local family center and small sports complex.\n\nAs on other days, the migrants jumped at any opportunity to catch rides.

The officer exchanged gunfire with Long, who was found dead at the scene.\n\nVentura County Sheriff Bill Ayub said an autopsy determined Long fatally shot himself.\n\nAuthorities have yet to determine a motive and are exploring all possibilities. Among them is whether Long believed a former girlfriend might have been at the bar, which was filled with about 150 people on its popular college night that attracts students from several nearby schools.\n\nSheriff's Capt. Garo Kuredjian said investigators were still interviewing witnesses, have served a search warrant at Long's home and searched the car Long drove to the bar.\n\n\"We're going to exhaust every investigative means possible,\" Kuredjian told the Ventura County Star.\n\nKuredjian said there is no timeline for completing the investigation. The analysis of items obtained in the searches could take months, he said.\n\nFormer Sheriff Geoff Dean, whose last day on the job was Friday, said investigators believe Long targeted the bar but don't know why. At least a half-dozen people interviewed by The Associated Press who described themselves as regulars at the bar don't ever recall seeing Long there.\n\nAuthorities described an attack of military efficiency . When Long shot his .45-caliber pistol, he killed. All of the injured suffered cuts, bruises and other minor injuries in frantic attempts to escape the gunfire. Some smashed windows and jumped out.\n\nBased on time stamps, investigators say, Long posted to Instagram during the attack. The post involved his mental state and whether people would believe he was sane.\n\nHis social media accounts have been taken down but a law enforcement official said Long posted about his mental state and whether people would believe he was sane. The official, who was briefed on the investigation but not authorized to discuss it publicly, spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nLong grew up in Thousand Oaks and several people who knew him described him in disturbing terms. Long made others feel uncomfortable going back to his teens.\n\nDominique Colell, who coached girls' track and field at the high school where Long was a sprinter, remembers an angry young man who could be verbally and physically combative.\n\nIn one instance, Colell said Long used his fingers to mimic shooting her in the back of the head as she talked to another athlete. In another, he grabbed her rear and midsection after she refused to return a cellphone he said was his.\n\n\"I literally feared for myself around him,\" Colell said in an interview Friday. \"He was the only athlete that I was scared of.\"\n\nPolice said Long had no criminal record. However, last April, yelling and loud banging noises coming from the home Long shared with his mother prompted a next-door neighbor to call authorities .\n\nDeputies responded and a mental health specialist who assessed Long worried he might be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder but found no grounds to hospitalize him.", "A suspended West Virginia Supreme Court justice who was recently convicted of 11 federal charges is stepping down just ahead of a special legislative session to consider his removal, the governor's office disclosed Saturday.\n\nIt was the latest development in an impeachment scandal miring some past and present justices in varying accusations including abuse of authority and failure to rein in excessive spending that has engulfed the state's highest court for months.\n\nRepublican Gov. Jim Justice's office said late Saturday that he received a letter from Justice Allen Loughry and accepted his resignation effective at the close of business Monday, a day ahead of Tuesday's scheduled special session. Justice had no further comment in his brieft statement, and Loughry's one-sentence resignation letter didn't elaborate.\n\nLoughry was convicted last month of federal criminal charges including wire fraud involving his personal use of state cars and fuel cards and mail fraud. He has requested a new trial.\n\nLoughry couldn't be reached for comment and phone and email messages seeking comment from his attorney, John A. Carr, were not immediately returned.\n\nJustice recently called a special legislative session for Tuesday, saying in his proclamation that it would consider removing Loughry from his post.\n\nLoughry and three other justices were impeached by the West Virginia House in August over questions involving lavish office renovations that evolved into varying accusations of corruption, incompetence and neglect of duty. One of them, Justice Beth Walker, was cleared of an impeachment charge at a Senate trial last month.\n\nThe West Virginia Supreme Court last month effectively halted the Legislature's remaining efforts to impeach the state's justices as a violation of the separate of power doctrine. The court ruled that the Senate lacks jurisdiction to pursue its impeachment trial of Justice Margaret Workman.\n\nThe Senate had postponed Workman's trial after the presiding judge didn't show up following the court ruling. A panel of acting justices said the court's decision to stop Workman's impeachment hearing also applies to retired Justice Robin Davis and Loughry, who had petitioned the court to intervene.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear whether Loughry's imminent departure would alter Tuesday's special session plans.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate President Mitch Carmichael, a Republican, lauded the resignation announcement Saturday.\n\n\"We appreciate that Justice Loughry has decided to do the right thing and step down from the Court,\" Carmichael said in a statement. He added that with the resignation and recent voter approval of a judicial budget oversight amendment, \"I believe we are well on our way to rebuilding the trust of our citizens in the judicial branch.\"\n\nJudicial elections in West Virginia became nonpartisan in 2016, but the court's impeachment scandal this year stirred political attacks. Some Democrats argued that the court's shakeup over spending and other issues was a power grab by the Republican-led legislature.\n\nOn Election Day, two state Supreme Court justices appointed to the court after the scandal broke won election to continue on the bench: Former House speaker Tim Armstead and ex-Congressman Evan Jenkins won those races Tuesday night, each defeating nine other candidates. They had originally been appointed by Justice to fill two of the seats on the state's highest court pending the midterm election.\n\nArmstead will complete the term of Justice Menis Ketchum, who announced his resignation on the eve of the House's impeachment proceedings. The term runs through 2020.\n\nJenkins will serve until 2024, when the term of retired Justice Robin Davis ends. Davis also was impeached.\n\nThe ballot measure approved by voters allows the Legislature to decide each year whether to reduce the courts' budget but not less than 85 percent of the previous year's budget. It also would require the Supreme Court's chief justice to answer budget questions before lawmakers. Opponents have said limiting the Supreme Court's budgetary control would infringe on its independence.\n\nThe chief justice currently has constitutional autonomy in deciding how the system spends a $139 million annual budget.", "Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a one-time speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan who later became Russia's leading defender on Capitol Hill and an outspoken advocate for legalized marijuana, was defeated Saturday, a victim of California's Democratic tilt and voters' distaste for President Donald Trump.\n\nRohrabacher, 71, was beaten by real estate executive Harley Rouda, 56, a Republican-turned-Democrat who pilloried the congressman for his skepticism over climate change and depicted him as an out-of-touch abettor in Washington gridlock.\n\nWith votes continuing to be counted, Rouda's edge grew steadily. The vote count updated Saturday showed Rouda with 52 percent of the vote and about 8,500 more votes than Rohrabacher.\n\nRohrabacher's ouster from his seat in Orange County has historical and symbolic significance. The county southeast of Los Angeles was home to President Richard Nixon and long considered a foundational block in the modern conservative movement. Reagan himself likened it to a Republican heaven.\n\nOrange County was once a Republican lock on Election Day, said Fred Smoller, associate professor of political science at Chapman University.\n\n\"Their lock is over,\" he said.\n\nWith Rouda's win, Democrats have picked off two GOP seats either all or partly in the county since Tuesday's election, and are threatening in two others. Democrat Mike Levin this week captured the seat long held by retiring Rep. Darrell Issa, which cuts through the southern end of the county. Democrats have also seized a GOP-held seat north of Los Angeles.\n\nRouda credited his victory to support from \"voters across the political spectrum.\" In a statement, he said he intends to be \"honest, transparent, accessible and tireless\" in Washington.\n\nRohrabacher's campaign said in a statement that tens of thousands of ballots remain uncounted, and the campaign will have a statement once the vote count is complete.\n\nDemocrats had targeted seven GOP-held House districts in California this year that were carried by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, including Rohrabacher's 48th. They've now won three of those seats, with the potential to pick up three more and pad their new majority in the House.\n\nDemocrat Katie Porter is inching closer to Republican U.S. Rep. Mimi Walters in Orange County's 45th District. In the nearby 39th District held by retiring GOP Rep. Ed Royce his protege, Republican Young Kim, sees her lead over Democrat Gil Cisneros tightening.\n\nIn central California's farm belt, Democrat Josh Harder grabbed a nearly 2-point lead after a vote count update Friday after trailing Rep. Jeff Denham in the 10th District.\n\nFor state Republicans, Rohrabacher's defeat represents another stinging blow for a party that has seen its fortunes wither for years. Democrats hold every statewide office, both chambers of the Legislature and a 3.7 million advantage in voter registrations. With Rouda's win, Democrats will hold at least a 42-11 edge in California U.S. House seats.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans have tumbled to third-party status in the state: they are even outnumbered by registered independents.\n\nBehind the shift: A surge in immigrants in recent decades transformed the state and its voting patterns. In Orange County, largely white, conservative homeowners once delivered winning margins for GOP candidates year after year. But most of the state's new voters, Hispanics and Asians, are Democrats or independents.\n\nIt's also hard to discount the influence of Trump, who lost California by over 4 million votes in 2016. California is home to the so-called Trump \"resistance,\" which has stood in opposition to his policies on the environment and immigration.\n\nRohrabacher reflects the dramatic shift of fortunes in Orange County: He was re-elected by nearly 17 points just two years but met his end when Democrats backed a wealthy, pro-business moderate in Rouda.\n\nRohrabacher has long been an unusual figure on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe one-time Cold Warrior transformed into an outspoken supporter of improved ties with Russia, and his name has come up in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election; he has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy was heard on tape in 2016 saying Rohrabacher was being paid by Russian President Vladimir Putin. McCarthy's office said the comments at a private meeting, disclosed by the Washington Post, were misconstrued and McCarthy was joking with colleagues.\n\nIn the campaign, Rohrabacher was faced with the prospect of making his Reagan-era conservative views appealing to newer voters, while holding college-educated Republican women who polls suggest are turned off by Trump.\n\nHis departure from Congress will mark a milestone of sorts. He's one of the last members of Congress who served in the Reagan administration.\n\nThe guitar-strumming, surfing congressman apparently saw the danger coming. He positioned himself as a maverick willing to buck both parties.\n\nRepublican Party mailers never mentioned he was a Republican.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Michael R.

Add Iran as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Iran news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nSaturday's event -- the Asian Champions League final pitting an Iranian team known as Persepolis against a Japanese squad called the Kashima Antlers --- saw the most significant female presence at a top soccer match in Iran since the Islamic revolution in the late 1970s.\n\nIranian conservatives have persistently been opposed to women attending live sports matches, but cultural pressure has been steadily building against the ban.\n\n\u201cIt is time to let women in,\u201d said Reza, 45, a real state employee who was trying to find a ticket to enter the stadium.\n\n\"We are fed up with so much economic pressures. We all need fresh air,\" he said.\n\nReformists and women\u2019s rights activists have been pushing for opening the doors to stadiums for years. Besides, pressures from international bodies seeking Iran's compliance with their required equality standards have occasionally forced Iranian authorities to let at least a small group of women in.\n\nSomaye Malekian/ABC News\n\nThe practice invited widespread criticism by social media users who alleged that there were select groups of women attending the stadium to fulfill international expectations, an allegation denied by authorities.\n\n\u201cI prefer watching nonsense soap operas than Persepolis and Kashima\u2019s match with this way of selecting the spectators,\u201d wrote Samira Alampanah on her .\n\n\u201c \u201d It is time to let women in...We all need fresh air.\n\nWaiting outside the doors about three hours before the match, Yalda, 28, said \u201cwe want to get in for Persepolis.\"\n\nLike most other women at the stadium who spoke with ABC News, Yalda declined to provide her last name for fear of retaliation over a still very contentious national debate in Iran.\u201d\n\nSomaye Malekian/ABC News\n\n\"So, it will have some real fans on the seats, not just the select group allowed in to appease FIFA and AFC,\u201d she said, referring respectively to the international and Asian governing bodies of professional soccer, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association and the Asian Football Confederation. Outside the U.S, soccer is known as football.\n\nBut Yalda\u2019s path was tougher than she had imagined. She and a group of about 200 fans had to pass three gates before entering the stadium -- each one of which kept their hopes of getting in hanging in the balance.\n\nIronically, some of the women reported, the officials at each gate were as uncertain as women themselves.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been told ten times to go home and watch the match on TV, and then another official comes and says 'there is still hope,'\u201d said Mahsa Taheri, 27, an accountant who decided to skip a day at work once she heard that women would be allowed in.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to stay,\u201d she said.\n\nAtta Kenare/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAfter several hours of waiting, the gates were eventually opened for Yalda and others. A security official who requested anonymity told ABC News that Fariba Mohammadian, Iran's Women's Deputy Minister of Sports, helped exhausted and intimidated female fans into the stadium.\n\n\u201c \u201d I prefer watching nonsense soap opera than Persepolis and Kashima\u2019s match with this way of selecting the spectators.\n\nBut, by the time the women got inside, the section of about 850 seats allocated to females was almost full. Despite being on their feet at the gates for hours, the newly-arrived fans started to cheer their team, many shedding tears of joy.\n\nAtta Kenare/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI am proud that we insisted so much, leaving no way for the officials but to compromise to some extent,\u201d said Maral, 42, who had come to watch the game with her sisters and her cousin. \u201cWe want our team to know that everyone supports them, not just men.\u201d\n\nIn a note published on FIFA's website, FIFA president Gianni Infantino said it was \u201ca historic and festive day for football, a real breakthrough.\u201d\n\nInfantino thanked Iranian President Hassan Rouhani for paving the way for the women's attendance at the stadium.\n\nVahid Salemi/AP\n\n\u201cThis is the power of football and makes it all worthwhile!\u201d\n\n\u201c \u201d I\u2019ve been told ten times to go home and watch the match on TV, and then another official comes and says 'there is still hope.'\n\nOnce allowed in, some fans burst into tears of joy which were subsequently supplanted by tears of disappointed fans.\n\nPersepolis lost the final to its Japanese rival.\n\n\u201cOne thing I am sure is that we will definitely come again,\u201d Maral said.\n\n\u201cWe know that there will be gates on the way, but we hope it gets easier to get in.\u201d", "Democrat Kyrsten Sinema is continuing to inch ahead in the slow-motion finish to Arizona's U.S. Senate race.\n\nOn Saturday night, she remained a little more than a percentage point ahead of Republican Martha McSally. She gained 4,000 votes from a batch of ballots tallied in Maricopa County as well as a few thousand from elsewhere in the state.\n\nIt may take until Thursday to count all the votes. Arizona typically takes more than a week to tally its mail ballots. McSally is hoping for a late shift toward her in the remaining ballots. There are more than 250,000 outstanding. About 2.4 million votes were cast in the election.", "Lu Yushan, a retired salesman, has advice for investors in China's slumping stock market: Sell.\n\nLu's shares soared over the past decade. But the 65-year-old cashed out this year, driven away by plunging prices, insider trading scandals, a cooling economy and a tariff war with Washington.\n\n\"Investors should get out,\" said Lu, watching flickering prices on a wall-mounted display at a Beijing brokerage. \"I am here just for fun and not to make money.\"\n\nPresident Xi Jinping's government is struggling, with limited success, to dispel such gloom and talk stock prices back up with promises of tax cuts, more bank lending and a media campaign led by its economy czar.\n\nThe benchmark Shanghai Composite Index sank 30 percent from January through mid-October. Prices fell so far that China gave up its status as the No. 2 market by share value after the United States and dropped to third place behind Japan. The index has gained 5 percent since late October but is the world's worst performer this year.\n\nThe slump adds to challenges for communist leaders as they try to shore up economic growth and carry on a tariff war with President Donald Trump over Beijing's technology policy. It also puts a kink in plans for state industry to use share sales to pay down a multibillion-dollar mountain of debt and modernize.\n\nChina's markets are unusual among large countries. Created to raise money for state industry, they have a growing number of private firms but still are dominated by government companies such as oil giant PetroChina Ltd. and China Mobile Ltd., the world's biggest phone carrier.\n\nPrices react to policy changes instead of economic performance. Conditions abroad have little influence because Chinese markets are kept walled off from global financial flows. A handful of U.S. and European financial firms have been granted the status of domestic investors since 2002 but the main class of \"A'' shares is off-limits to most foreign investors.\n\nThe latest price slide began in January after Beijing clamped down on bank lending to rein in surging debt.\n\nShares in real estate and other companies that thrive on credit were hit hard. Aluminum Corp. of China, a major building materials supplier, tumbled 52 percent. China Vanke Co., a developer, is off 40 percent.\n\nThe economic downturn brought on by credit controls was more abrupt than Chinese leaders wanted, prompting them to reverse course and tell banks to lend more. They promised tax cuts and other help after economic growth slumped to a post-global crisis low of 6.5 percent over a year earlier in the three months ending in September.\n\nBut the impact of those measures has yet to show up in economic data.\n\n\"Market sentiment has remained very weak,\" UBS economists said in a report.\n\nThe slump drove university student Shao Xinyu to the sidelines less than a year after he started buying stocks.\n\nShao, from the central city of Zhengzhou, invested 30,000 yuan ($5,000) from his savings and gifts from his parents. The market plunge slashed the value of that stake by one-third.\n\n\"I won't invest more,\" said Shao, 21. \"I need to wait to see how the economy and the market develop.\"\n\nChina's stock markets have ridden a boom-and-bust roller coaster since 1990, when the first exchange since the 1949 communist revolution opened in Shanghai. A second exchange followed the next year in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong.\n\nPrices soared and slumped in 2001, 2008 and again in 2015.\n\nDespite that, small investors piled into stocks.\n\nThe number of individual Chinese trading accounts nearly quintupled between 2006 and 2017, hitting 192 million, according to the Shanghai Stock Exchange's annual report.\n\nBrokerages opened trading rooms where small investors with jars of tea and bundles of financial newspapers perched on plastic seats in front of wall-mounted price monitors. Today, most of those have closed as trading shifted online.\n\nThree-quarters of Chinese trading accounts are worth less than 500,000 yuan ($71,000), according to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, and most traders have a few thousand dollars invested, buying shares directly instead of using mutual funds.\n\nLu, the retired salesman, said he started out 15 years ago with 10,000 yuan ($1,500) and turned that into 100,000 yuan ($15,000) before selling most of his shares.\n\nIndividual investors owned about 21 percent of the market as of the end of 2017, or shares worth 5.9 trillion yuan ($842 billion), according to the Shanghai exchange. Galaxy Securities, a brokerage, says about 30 percent of that, or 1.9 trillion yuan ($271 billion), was in mutual funds.\n\nInvestors already were skittish after the 2015 price collapse. Then, Beijing plowed billions of dollars into stopping the slide and suspended plans for stock offerings by state-owned companies.\n\nConfidence took another hit after a wave of arrests of brokerage executives, a star Chinese trader and a former market regulator on charges of insider trading and manipulating prices.\n\nLi Jun, a retired hotel chief executive in the eastern city of Nanjing, said his nest egg of 300,000-400,000 yuan ($40,000-$60,000) in stocks was cut in half by the market routs in 2008 and 2015.\n\n\"I avoid putting in more money, because what is the use of doing that?\" said Li, 81.\n\nRegulators have tried in vain to encourage investors to shift from rapid-fire trading to holding for the long term. The Shanghai exchange said individual investors accounted for 82 percent of its daily trading volume in 2017, little changed from previous years.\n\nInstead, regulators are gradually allowing in more foreign buyers in hopes they will provide ballast as long-term investors.\n\nSince 2014, foreigners have been able to buy some \"A'' shares through Hong Kong. In July, regulators announced foreigners working in China would be given access to the whole market.Now, investors worry about a possible new downward spiral if prices of shares pledged as collateral by companies for loans fall far enough that banks and brokerages might seize and sell them to recover their money.\n\nThe government tried to allay those fears by announcing on Oct. 19 that Chinese insurers would be allowed to create units to buy such shares temporarily to keep them from flooding the market.\n\nThe same day, officials led by Vice Premier Liu He, Xi's top economic adviser, launched a media campaign to talk prices back up. The central bank governor, Yi Gang, was quoted as saying \"economic fundamentals are good.\" Liu said cheaper stocks created \"good investment opportunities.\"\n\n\"I welcome the government's efforts to support the markets,\" said Li, the retired hotel executive. \"But as for whether that is effective, I really don't know.\"\n\nThe Shanghai index gained 4 percent after the ruling party leadership promised Oct. 31 to \"intensify reform.\" That prompted expectations of further easing in lending controls.\n\nXi followed with a Nov. 1 speech that promised tax cuts and other help to entrepreneurs that generate new jobs and wealth. Private sector analysts saw that as an affirmation of the importance of private business amid complaints state industry is a drag on the economy.\n\nThe latest measures helped to reassure Liu Fei, a manager at a Shanghai real estate company. She stuck with the market after losing 40 percent of her money in the 2015 crash but said her faith was waning.\n\n\"A week ago, I panicked and felt the Chinese stock market was finished,\" said Liu, 28. \"But I gained confidence after the government issued supporting policies.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press researcher Yu Bing contributed to this report."]
