Four crucial days until the midterms. Democrats working to take control of the house, and Republicans working just as hard to add on to the senate. And president trump talking about the new jobs report, and defending what he said about taking aim at migrants who throw rocks. Here's Terry Moran. Reporter: News of the booming economy came as a shot of adrenaline for president trump, heading into the final weekend of the campaign. And what job numbers we had today. Did you hear? Did you hear? Well, we'll go into that. They all say, speak about the economy. Speak about the economy. Reporter: With just four days to go, today's jobs report gave the president something to talk about. 250,000 jobs added in October. Wages rising at the fastest clip in nearly a decade. America now has the best economy in the history of our country and we want to keep it this way. Reporter: The happy economic news allowed the president to pivot away from what had been his closing argument -- the politics of fear, stoking anxiety about that migrant caravan making its way through Central America. This is an invasion, and nobody is even questioning that. Reporter: But, there is no invasion. The migrants fleeing poverty and crime are 900 miles away from the border. Still, the president says he's sending up to 15,000 military personnel to stop them. He even hinted the soldiers, who are in a logistical support role only, could use their weapons on the migrants. Could you envision them firing upon any of these people? And could you see -- I hope not. I hope not. It's the military. I hope there won't be that, but I will tell you this. Anybody throwing stones, rocks, we will consider that a firearm because there's not much difference. Reporter: Today, the president was pressed on that. Are you really okay with the U.S. Military firing on the caravan people? No, they won't have to fire. What I don't want is, I don't want these people throwing rocks. I didn't say shoot. I didn't say shoot. But they do that with us, they're going to be arrested for a long time. Reporter: But when he was asked again -- Can you promise that the military is not going to fire on foreign civilians? Well, I hope they won't. We're gonna see. I hope they won't. Reporter: And in Florida today, former president Obama called him out. They're telling you the existential threat to America is a bunch of poor refugees 1,000 miles away. They're even taking our brave troops away from their families for a political stunt at the border. And the men and women of our military deserve better than that. And Terry joins us live. The president is on the campaign trail nonstop between now and election day? Reporter: That's right, David. The final blitz. When you look at the schedule, the president is basically targeting Democrat senators he thinks are vulnerable.

Both are in close -- and at times nasty -- races against Democrats Richard Ojeda and incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin.\n\nTrump won the Mountain State by an overwhelming percent of the vote in the presidential election -- a fact the president was eager to share with the crowd.\n\n\"You know what that's like -- did anyone ever hear of 42 points?\" Trump said, reminding the audience of the large margin by which he won against Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe Trump mocked political prognostications of a \"blue wave\" in 2018.\n\n\"A blue wave equals a crime wave,\" Trump said. \"A red wave equals jobs and safety.\"\n\nBut he added: \"I'm not saying they're not going to squeak by,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president said, while aboard Air Force One, he had watched former President Barack Obama's campaign appearance for Democrats in Florida, but claimed Obama had a \"small crowd.\"\n\n\"I was in the plane, I have nothing else to do, I heard him talk about telling the truth,\" Trump said, \"And yet, he said you can keep your doctor if you like,\" in a reference to Obamacare.\n\nOn a day when the president could be talking about the economy, he focused on immigration, Kavanaugh, coal, and health care -- a hot topic in the Mountain State.\n\n\"They all say 'speak about the economy, speak about the economy.' Well, we have the greatest economy in the history of our country. But sometimes it's not as exciting to talk about the economy, right? \u2018Cause we have a lot of other things to talk about,\" Trump said.\n\nIn a mostly rural, Appalachian state thousands of miles away from the Southern border, Trump got the crowd riled up over immigration.\n\n\"Do we let them in?\" Trump asked, to which the crowd yelled an answer: \"Build the wall!\"\n\nThe president went on to tell the crowd, without evidence, that the caravans from Central America are bringing in people with criminal records. He appeared to defend his controversial and racially-charged campaign ad posted on Twitter about an illegal immigrant who killed two California law enforcement officers.\n\n\"I put it up on Twitter and they gave me a hard time. They said you shouldn't be doing that, that's not nice. And I say all I'm doing is just telling the truth,\" Trump said.\n\n\"Illegal immigration cost American taxpayers more than $100 billion every single year -- more than 20 times the entire state budget of the state of West Virginia,\" Trump claimed.\n\nTrump did not cite a source for the figure, though it may be based on a study by Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), a nonprofit that advocates against immigration and is regularly cited by conservatives. A study by FAIR in September 2017 said the total tax burden caused by the country's illegal immigrant population is $115 billion a year.\n\nLiberal nonprofits, like the Center for American Progress (CAP), show just the opposite, saying limiting immigrants and deporting those here will be a net-loss for the country. A study from CAP in September 2016 reported a $434 billion annual loss in the nation's gross domestic product if unauthorized immigrants were removed from the economy.\n\nThe president called out Manchin for his last-minute vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. The president said he spoke to Manchin on the phone about his vote days before the confirmation votes and the Manchin said he would think about casting a key vote for Kavanaugh.\n\n\"Nobody's smoother than Joe,\" Trump said. \"He's much smoother than Schumer, actually,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president claimed again that Republicans are for keeping pre-existing conditions -- an issue that has become a hot-button campaign issue in West Virginia because Morrissey joined 19 other state attorneys general in a lawsuit to try to end Obamacare and potentially take away protections for pre-existing conditions.\n\n\"Republicans will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions,\" Trump told the crowd.\n\nThe claim is dubious because while the American Health Care Act, the failed replacement for Obamacare, would have prevented insurers from limiting access to those with pre-existing conditions, the increasing costs could have unintentionally forced many off their plans anyway, health care experts warned.\n\n\"We had Obamacare killed except for one Republican vote,\" Trump said, in a jab at the late Sen.

Of migrants who have been lining the highways here we've also seen a number of people who have climbed onto the back of a pickup trucks and eighteen wheelers. A continuing to go to go north now the reason I we are here. Is because the original caravan that we've been following for weeks now this is split up into really two groups. And 088 includes one group that his father hit in the other and it actually shall appear in Chicago that probably six. Which was opened just a short time ago. To give the migrants some shelter from the rain and has been raining here today certainly of that has brought the temperature down. But they're still exposed to the elements in back to your original question DeVon how we talk about who we see. I mean you could just look around are just behind me here and you can clearly see that there are our young either young children who are here is also teenagers and and and men and women it really isn't a diverse group and I ask the director of the civil protection agency here in sight you lump. If they've had any problems. Had has there been violence has their but have there been a crime to reported. And the director told me absolutely not and that so far everything has been keyed low which is what he's that in Spanish everything's been fine and he hopes it it stays that way. And certainly that's what we have seen so far here DeVon. In Veracruz state. Yes are the poorest people we know fleeing violence and poverty in Honduras are making their way up Marcus. And that's a heck of a long walk how far are they going each day what's what's your latest estimate on now how long it would take them to even reach the United States and fort. You know DeVon if there are on foot it and it won't take. Another few weeks to even get close to the exit to the US Mexico border so all we have seen is that a number of people available been a part of this caravan they've actually hops onto. Two vehicles and to trucks and so they've been able to cover a lot of ground. Each day when I was here last week. They world they started out and popular which is city right along the border we get out of the way here Jimmy stempel to peninsula. It was the city were very close to the border. At a one day they were able to make it to the the next town and so we're talking about covering ninety kilometers. Or so. If you're able to hitch a ride on one of the trucks but if you walking off. There's not a lot you can not not not a lot of ground that you can cover so all right now we're here in cellular. Com yeah. The thinking is that perhaps there will go to another town. That's farther north by about ten more minutes or so that's my car. But again last week Devean we were we were in the midst of this journey. We're talking about brutal heat temperatures well into the ninety's. And people walking with their children and their relatives it was absolutely unbearable. And they would trying to leave in the morning when it would be cooler and easier for them to traverse. On this journey but now. It is noticeably cooler I can tell you and and certainly that. My perhaps mean that they could get a little bit farther along on this journey but. As you mentioned. Still about a thousand miles from the US Mexico border. All right Marcus Moore for us and Mexico. Following those migrants many of them asylum seekers thank you so much for your reporting. Marcus and as the election and now gets close to the president. Really ramping up the fear of the sense of fear of those people as you just saw their Marcus and weeks away Martha. I'm why didn't he say he and he said the president saying that this is a perilous situation he's hockey story send in the troops in the border. Talking 151000. Troops. Down there and wouldn't. Let's take it any mind let's remind everybody again there that's how many troops we have. In Afghanistan hiding the Taliban probably won't go up to 151000. But who knows I think the bigger question is exactly what they can do we are sending active duty. Military. Service members down to the border. They can't do law enforcement duties. Our law they can't process come a taught us so they can't arrest. They can't roundup people they can't have anything to do with that so what the Pentagon is saying they're doing is helping to set up. Tense and not for the migrants. But for the Border Patrol so will they be hanging out those tests tense in the heat will they be passing out water. But you've got all these active duty military who are. Act act I know well how many deployments. These service members make again and again and again and again bright orange wave from their families they are and use military. Actually service members and and the guard if if they're going to active duty. Are basically trained to key a the military police. Our have a more of a police and beauty when there in the military but we are sending vat many active duty military know some of them are military police some of them are engineers. That this is not in normal thing. And there is literate in it's different from piece to me there is no mention. They don't have the mission OK so the idea is if you're listening for president or that there is an invasion across border invasion and that's what they're there to confront. But historically. We see that this is not what happens. These these caravans in the past they go to ports of entry in they wait. An eyewitness. I happen which happened many times before and in fact the president's cup of tea and in that with the president's comments about if they throw rocks in their have been skirmishes with some with some of these caravans since yesterday and isn't it did little ride to New Hampshire which had been scourge is down the road yes yes can't wait wait wait wait a year or so to your point just and so they come to the border and whether they unity exactly throwing rocks at US forces who are back from Brett. The border but to try to days at rocks if they're applying for asylum because they're there is I I got the scenarios are very confusing. It's taken out in attendance started touring marked it by saying something like if they turn Iraq's we'll see that as a god idea and the US forces. Ken practice self defense and mean anytime anywhere they are they can practice he sedimentary rocks as bullets is if they were shooting units but and we in the US forces don't carry rocks were pressured him on fire back so it isn't just disproportionate which it should not ever being. But it it's also accidents waiting to happen in only 97 southern. Submarine the president tried to walk that back a little that's a dead heat and set and we're not gonna shoot we're not gonna buy them or not you'll want. And on now talk Tom it's almost like you know don't don't keep saying those things we're not gonna shoot them. But again if you're in a position where in your head you have somebody saying something like that and they can't practice up tents and I've seen in 97 there was rain. Who is helping with surveillance active duty there is a goat herder I believe it was coming crossing across the probably thought it was in the middle of nowhere I think he was firing a rifle or whatever the Marines thought they were under fire on an aunt and gunfire and higher ground it's. It's Brett good writing in the fleeing before we move on it didn't want troops that he says is TT your very point Martha Martin Dempsey who you know well former chairman of the joint chiefs it's yet staff tweeted. Late yesterday about this situation we think didn't address it specifically never names and that's always a kind of there unless or until it says our men and women in uniform better trained better equipped. Better read so they meet any threat with confidence but a wasteful deployment of over stretch soldiers and Marines. Will be made much worse if they use disproportional force to the threat they face. They won't he's expressing confidence in and they tend to my dad's also send. He's slowly came wasteful GAAP results in waste exactly saying it's a wasteful deployment team to Justin's point what when he is the exact mission and why you need the US military. If they can't. If they can't make arrests if they can't. Do law enforcement duties so you've got the US military which is. As general Dempsey who knows a thing or two about deployment says. But the Q what are they gonna do there but I I think that's his own gentle be careful about their guys because there is room for accident I have faith in you but be careful. And getting mixed messages from revered one of their own and of course the commander in chief just a little while ago weighing in on this again on the South Lawn as he headed out our Karen Travers was there she joins us from the White House Karen. Are pretty contentious president this afternoon doubling down on the rhetoric and also pointing his finger at you when you asked him a pretty tough question Tulsa back. Quite literally DeVon asked the president about the new poll from ABC news in the Washington Post which found that. Half of Americans say the president is encouraging politically motivated violence with his speech I presented that stabbed to the president was starting to ask him a question threatening into rock. This is what he had to say. Arrogant thing you're encouraging politically motivated violent with the way you see Doug you know what you are creating violence. I hear what you. You are created do at all so a lot of the reporters are creating violence by not writing that vote. The fake nose is creating bio. Earlier this week avenue remembers air standards with pushed in the contentious exchange of our colleague Jon Karl about the president blaming the media for the violence recently here in this country and senators said the president's not placing any blame she said the president condemns that shooting at Pittsburgh last week that the media is the one that very quickly pointed the finger at him and jumped on him but as you heard the president say right there. DeVon he'd send UU the media and is trying to make a distinction between what the president says his fake news. And all news but the president in tweets in the past has referred buying aimed average television network in his view as they media. And Karen also seeming you can read into some of the comments today the president sort of laying the ground work. For the potential loss of control the House of Representatives Democrats. Seemed poised in the latest forecast to take over the house the president said. He thinks this violence in the mid book the bomber the Florida bomber also the shooting in Pittsburgh. The media's coverage of both of those things he sees those as potentially disrupting. Republicans' momentum. And then he's an act and that's that's what he's claiming it right. Thank you said that at a rally at that essentially that they had some wind at their back in all of this recent controversy and violence had put a stop to that a lot of questions today about the president's closing argument what he's going to be saying on the campaign trail over the next couple of days and whether or not he can work with Democrats if they do you take control of the house. Devin we might be seeing a at bringing back a reprise of the check in Nancy and president Trump's show when he cut that deal with them last year and he certainly isn't ruling out working with them and that might be his new realities starting in January. All right Karen Travers at the White House thank you so much for joining us Karen of freer reporting there on the south plummet the president I want to bring in our legal analysts now keep shock to unpack. All of these claims by the president a little bit further the president in dropping hints that he has a number of executive orders coming on everything from asylum to birthright citizenship. Kate A you've studied these things there's a lot of blowback from members of his own party and of course from Democrats that these are not legal. Well and you know DeVon I think the blow that he's actually been surprisingly bipartisan I think that largely I think. The president does a lot of controversial things but I have rarely seen such as the three unified response to a presidential proposal as I have to be. Birthright citizenship proposal this week so. Left and right legal scholars of all stripes have been pretty unanimous in explaining that the president does not have the power under the constitution. To undo the principle of birthright citizenship it is clearly granted by the fourteenth amendment which provides an anyone born in the United States is a citizen of the United States and not only the constitution there's a statute that essentially. Repeats the same language so even if by some stretch and were possible to make the change the president described he would need to be done by congress and not by the president and again. It's been a pretty unanimous reaction so maybe it's good politics to make this point but the law is. Pretty squarely against ever actually pursuing a proposal like that. Kate in the president's proposals have been just that proposals he has not yet signed her unveiled any of these things and it does seem to be a good bit of politics here. But as you know a number of civil rights groups have already lined up promising to challenge in court any of these moves if they actually come to fruition writing ACLU. I was out just today saying they are ready to fight back. Absolutely so you know I I think that. Many of these proposals I would be very surprised ever to seek converted into an executive order so. Typically the president would consult the Department of Justice his own White House Counsel's Office. Before actually issuing an executive order like this. In a few times that he is issued orders without real for a legal bedding inside the administration like the first couple of generations of the travel ban. Those have been swiftly invalidated by the courts and I'm confident that some an executive order that purported to undo birthright citizenship. Would swiftly encounter the same kind of legal obstacles to be challenged immediately. And it would likely be invalidated immediately and I think that's for about some of the other proposals the president has flooded this week as well. All right always great to have Kate shot in the briefing room for your analysis Kate thank you so much thanks to Martha Raddatz as well who had to. Had to take off moving on another big headline today in the world of foreign policy the president making good and has promised to get rid of the Iran deal and reimpose sanctions those take place on Monday. In fact take a look the president tweeted just a little while ago that. But it would gain of thrown asks later sanctions are coming the president Sweden if you can can see there in the lower left that's a picture of Donald Trump looks like a movie poster just looks just like the gamut from these are sanctions on or are you know at least he's the most biting saying they're very few out there in the oil isn't big ones these oil sanctions this is effectively what. Will really this really solidifies. The you know that the the president pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal. Bomb. It's hits. Iran were hurts the most with oil although I will say it's important to note they granted eight waivers. Two mostly Asian countries. So they can still buy Iranian oil. But I nevertheless this these are designed to hit Iranians hard and he seems to think that he can bring them back to the table. And he was sanctions that brought them to the table in the first place he thinks he can do. Stricter ones to make what he says would be a better deal that remains to basic. You know we will see what the blowback is to that announcement today also HBO just as a footnote here didn't like the president's usage game of terms they tweeted back that the president. Saying. Have that having a little riff on back to IDC trademark misuse and on track he if he hadn't seen the show. Object that is one of the tribes in the show ammo are okay I TV interview search around social medial feed the other indictments are coming there's a lot of trolling Callahan a lot of playfulness today okay. Movie not obviously four days away from the big mid term election on Tuesday and are our friends at 538 are tracking the latest they'd kept us honest all the way. With the forecasts in the brains behind the operation Nate Silver joins us now from New York Nate great to have you with us. Tom is so give us your top lines on the four latest forecasts in the house and the senate. A lot of conventional wisdom out there that the house is going for Democrats the senate will stay with Republicans. Break that down for us. Yeah I guess accordingly we are in line with the conventional wisdom. We have Democrats with about an 80% chance of taking the house. Rebels of the GOP with about 85% chance keeping the senate. And you see most of birds more and more in fact get around the time of the Kavanagh confirmation begin to see democratic incumbents have a lot of trouble in key senate seats like North Dakota. Meanwhile though the house playing field looks pretty bad for the GOP. They're not out of the running it's a large number of seats in play if they won every toss up race they would still win. But there are now a lot of signs of of momentum really either way but not favorable moment for the GOP in particular and that. House and yet both of these forecasts that you have made are not 100%. Negative fifteen Britain bound both sides has about a 15% likelihood that the other side wins that's a good that's it. A good bit of of uncertainty I'd say what is the biggest in terms of breaking down the model. What's the biggest factor of uncertainty when you when you put together for care. It's suffer one thing it's just because this race is fought on a district by district and state by state level. As people have to vote. In a 120 ref the competitive districts in the house in ten or twelve states in the senate to be competitive. You know to some it said the data tells a fairly consistent but not perfectly so story so we have seen. In the house Democrats raising tons and tons and tons of money and they are out advertising Republicans 21 in lot of districts effected that remains to be seen. The downside case the GOP is that all of a sudden. Incumbents who are not used to having close race are now getting out advertise. In front with the campaigns and close their race is poorly on the upside is that may be the president motivates you can turn to be a bit higher but you know. It's a bit cliche. But odd turn out is very important here we're gonna see a very high turnout. Does that mean that only Democrats turn out or that both parties to not that would affect when he went up at the bottom and near the low end of the range for Democrats gains in the house. An -- it's it's just to hear the I'm curious your take the immigration rhetoric from the president is obviously off the charts. What is your sense about the impact this is having is this a working strategy is there any way to track that. I mean our sense is that it hasn't had that much an effect either way in our forecast has been Mary flat. Look voters have a lot to think about this election cycle ethnic about the president thing about the economy which is a positive. For the president. They think about immigration haven't got Russia and a lot of things and so we have not seen. Much of a shift we saw some. Turbulence in the forecast if you will around the time here of the Kavanagh nomination process. But we haven't seen much affect recently maybe the presence already has declined. By a point or two. In some polls which is not great for him. But still I think voters have been locked into their decisions for a long tying there are not a ton of undecided voters and I think. I think you know the last campaign. Won't necessarily be game changer either way. All right it's over 538 thank you so much need for your forecast a you'll have the latest up to the minute. Down to the wire 538 Jack com. And now on the ABC news website as well they take so much cool thank you. All right where the campaign blitz is well underway with the president. Hitting the trail abrupt President Obama out on the trail as well today's us to day of dueling presidents out there. Let's go to out West Virginia now where America bride standing by awaiting president trump with a pretty feisty crowd. There behind you pretty big crowd to their merit give us give us yours you give us some color from on the ground there what's the mood West Virginia. All right Mary McGraw and Naia exciting. Campaign trail setting there the music is blaring and we will check reckon with you later Mary thank you so much the president. His remarks are coming up within the hour was and Jack and I think and media little rebellious and directed I'm sure if it. We'll have the president's remarks here to ABC's live coming up meanwhile President Obama is mentioned is out on the trail today as well he's and then in Florida. Just a little while ago wrapping up the stump speech we all which we also carried here for Andrew gill and he's the democratic candidate for governor Bill Nelson democratic senator in Florida. Here's a little bit of what President Obama had to say trolling president talked Nicholas. A president doesn't get to decide. On his own moves an American citizen. And how the constitution of the United States work. The bill right. And democracy works. All right taking President Obama taking am president trump in and the birthright citizenship. Hot topic among others Justin but I've been surprised by is that president trump. He hasn't gone back swinging at his predecessor. As much as you might expect. Well yeah he he hasn't really addressed a much at all. Bomb although DeVon there are still four days left and Mike five rallies. At least if I have that right refresh a rallies. Over the EU would on Sunday and Monday along I think it is so mom. I think he's got another deep inside and something else is coming we saw maybe a little flash of that today he was talking about the budget the positive jobs report. Mom some think he makes he could see to his inventions yeah. An economy beyond fire the economy is on fire and then beyond that no by the way 250000. Jobs. Adam last month unemployment staying at a fifty year low three point 7% certainly did think that rather run off good thing for all of us good thing for the country and Republicans are hoping. That carries them across all right we'll take you so much for watching this here in the briefing room today. A we will have full coverage on its on election night next Tuesday's special coverage starting at 4:30 PM eastern time with the big vote. Continuing on through 2 way and eastern time my colleague Dan Harris will be hosting I would be entire political team.

They will have a much better handle on the information and the decision-making process,\" Daniel Aaronson, one of Sayoc's private attorneys in Florida, told reporters after Friday's brief hearing.\n\nThe trip from the Southern District of Florida to the Southern District of New York will be by bus and could take as long as three weeks, prosecutors told ABC News. Sayoc has been detained in isolation since he was arrested in a parking lot in Plantation, Florida, on Oct. 26, following a days-long, nationwide manhunt for the suspect in an apparent mass mail bomb campaign.\n\nSayoc, whose residence is listed as his mother's home in Aventura, Florida, though he mainly lived in a white van plastered with pro-Trump stickers, could be sentenced to up to 48 years in prison if convicted of the five federal charges he's facing: interstate transportation of an explosive; illegal mailing of explosives; threats against former presidents and certain other persons; threatening interstate communications; and assaulting current and former federal officers.\n\n\u201cThe magnitude of what has happened does weigh on him,\" Aaronson told ABC News Friday, after telling reporters he's known Sayoc for nearly five years. \"He was the most respectful client that I have ever represented. When I heard his name in connection to this, I just stuttered and stammered that he could possibly be involved. It's just not the person that I know.\"\n\nThe attorney would not speculate as to what could have triggered the alleged plot to send crude pipe bombs to prominent public figures who have all spoken critically of President Donald Trump.\n\nDaniel Pontet via AP\n\nThe decision to transfer Sayoc comes on the heels of a letter New York prosecutors sent Tuesday to the judge presiding over Sayoc's case in Florida. They requested that Sayoc be moved to Manhattan to \"face the consequences of his actions\" and arguing that he remain behind bars pending trial \"due to both his dangerousness to the community and risk of flight.\"\n\n\"The defendant conducted a domestic terrorist attack targeting at least 15 victims,\" Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, wrote in the letter to U.S. Magistrate Judge Edwin Torres of the Southern District of Florida. \"There are no conditions that could adequately protect the public from the defendant and assure his appearance in Manhattan for trial.\"\n\nThe FBI seized and searched multiple electronic devices belonging to Sayoc and discovered files containing the addresses of his intended victims -- plus \"numerous additional targets\" -- and return labels that match those used on the padded mailing envelopes carrying the improvised explosive devices (IEDs), according to the letter.\n\n\"Metadata from the electronic devices indicates that the defendant started planning the attack as early as July 2018,\" Berman wrote. \"The evidence of the defendant\u2019s terror campaign is still being collected but is already overwhelming.\"\n\nBroward County Sheriffs Office via AP\n\nSo far, authorities have recovered at least 15 IEDs that Sayoc allegedly mailed to targets throughout the country, including former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as well as CNN's offices in New York City and Atlanta. Each device was packaged in a tan-colored manila envelope lined with bubble wrap and stamped with approximately six postage stamps bearing an image of an American flag, according to court documents.\n\nAll of the recipients are prominent critics of Trump, and many of them have been publicly disparaged by the president either at campaign rallies or on Twitter.\n\nEach envelope listed Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz as the return sender at a particular address in Sunrise, Florida. Authorities do not believe the South Florida congresswoman, who is the former head of the Democratic National Committee, was involved in sending any of the parcels.\n\nAll of the packages traveled through the U.S. Postal Service. They were all intercepted before they reached their intended targets, sources told ABC News.\n\nNone of the devices detonated, and no one was injured in handling the packages.\n\nThe packages and the contents were all sent for analysis to FBI's laboratory in Quantico, Virginia.\n\n\"The FBI's analysis of the defendant's IEDs is ongoing, but it is clear that they were dangerous,\" David Brown, FBI special agent, wrote in the Oct. 26 complaint against Sayoc. \"The IEDs that have been analyzed thus far contained energetic material with explosive qualities. The defendant also placed shards of glass in several of the IEDs for the apparent purpose of maximizing harm to his intended victims through the detonation of the devices that he had mailed.\"\n\nInvestigators have not determined a motive for the suspected mail bombs.\n\nABC News' Mark Crudele, Jack Date, Katherine Faulders, Armando Garcia, Aaron Katersky, Mike Levine, Josh Margolin and Pierre Thomas contributed to this report.", "bad url", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "Transcript for Alec Baldwin arrested after punching stranger in fight over parking spot: Sources\n\nActor Alec Baldwin was placed under arrest after police here in New York City said he punched a guy who tried to take a parking space that Baldwin was hoping to reserve for himself.

Add Interest\n\nAnd while there are so many things he said this week that need to be checked, this Fact Check Friday we'll briefly focus on major falsehoods surrounding two big issues the president has been pushing in these final days: immigration and health care.\n\nThe fact checks aren't complicated, but they both share one disturbing trend.\n\nOn both issues, President Trump is attempting to ascribe his most unpopular policies to his rivals, who in reality vehemently oppose them.\n\nLet's begin with immigration.\n\nSeparating children\n\nPresident Trump's most unpopular policy of his first two years in office may have been his \"zero tolerance policy\" at the border that resulted in the separations of thousands of migrant families from their children.\n\nIt was so unpopular he was eventually pressured into signing an executive order to undo it.\n\nOn Thursday, from the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Trump falsely claimed that his administration was reversing the separation of families that occurred President Barack Obama.\n\n\"Under President Obama, they separated children from the parents, Trump declared. \"We actually put it so that that didn't happen.\"\n\nIn reality, the Trump administration\u2019s policy resulted in the separation of an estimated 2,600 children from their families. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, 221 of those children still remain in U.S. custody and separated from their parents.\n\nCharles Reed/U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement/AP, FILE\n\nPresident Trump has claimed before that Obama separated children. It is true that during the Obama and Bush administrations, a number of arriving families were separated. (And of course, for decades U.S. immigration law has resulted more broadly in the separation of families when parents or siblings living in the U.S. are detained or deported).\n\nBut unlike the Trump administration\u2019s zero tolerance policy toward newly arriving migrants and asylum seekers, the majority of those cases were often tied to other crimes like drug trafficking or even returning to the U.S. after having been previously deported.\n\nHowever, Trump's suggestion Thursday that he did not separate families took this falsehood to an entirely new level.\n\n\u2018Republicans will totally protect people with Pre-Existing Conditions\u2019\n\nPresident Trump has been pushing this jaw-dropper for the past two weeks.\n\nOn Wednesday, he tweeted \"Republicans will totally protect people with pre-existing conditions far better than the Dems!\"\n\nRepublicans will protect people with pre-existing conditions far better than the Dems! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2018\n\nHe did it last week too.\n\nRepublicans will totally protect people with Pre-Existing Conditions, Democrats will not! Vote Republican. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 24, 2018\n\nThe claims are false, and, as we recently pointed out, they embody the theme of Trump projecting his own unpopular positions onto his opponents.\n\nThe facts are that health insurance protections for people with preexisting medical conditions is a major tenet of the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare.\n\nRepublicans in the House voted over 50 times to repeal the law after the law was enacted in 2010. When they took control of the Senate in 2016 they proposed to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a law that would weaken protections of people with preexisting conditions. It failed to pass.\n\nTurns out, this election cycle many Republican candidates are keyed into the fact that this is a really popular aspect of the law, and many of them are out there on the stump saying they'll keep these protections.\n\nThe problem, for them, and for the president, is that 20 Republican state attorneys general have signed onto a Texas lawsuit to overturn Obamacare with no replacement in sight. Many Republicans are actively fighting to overturn the law.\n\nMeantime, the claim that Democrats will not support protections for people with preexisting conditions has no basis in fact. Remember that Obamacare passed with zero Republican support.\n\n\"I will never lie to you\"\n\nFinally, if you didn't watch ABC News' Chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl interview with the president this week... do it now.\n\nHe pressed the president on his need for up to 15,000 troops at the border for what he has falsely described as a migrant \"invasion.\" But when this election is long forgotten, here's one quote from that interview that likely won't be.\n\n.@jonkarl asked Pres. Trump whether he has 'always been truthful' to the American people: \"When I can, I tell the truth. And sometimes it turns out to be where something happens that\u2019s different or there's a change, but I always like to be truthful.\" https://t.co/XUbdD7nNE3 pic.twitter.com/TkYFhqS8oC \u2014 World News Tonight (@ABCWorldNews) November 1, 2018\n\nKARL: \"And finally I remember well \u2013 you remember well in the campaign, you made a promise. You said, 'I will never lie to you.' Can you tell me now, honestly, have you kept that promise at all times? Have you always been truthful?\"\n\nTRUMP: \"Well I try. I do try. I think you try too. You say things about me that aren\u2019t necessarily correct. I do try, and I always want to tell the truth. When I can, I tell the truth. And sometimes it turns out to be where something happens that\u2019s different or there\u2019s a change, but I always like to be truthful.\"", "Tala and Rotana Farea, the sisters from Saudi Arabia whose bodies were found taped together in New York City's Hudson River last week, were said to have preferred suicide over returning to their home country, according to police.\n\nDermot Shea, chief of detectives for the New York City Police Department, said \"sources\" in Virginia, where the Farea sisters had previously been living, informed investigators that the two women had been in the United States for two to three years and would \"rather inflict harm on themselves and commit suicide than return to Saudi Arabia.\"\n\n\"Everything that we\u2019ve seen thus far is pointing to something other than a crime taking place,\" Shea told reporters at a news conference Friday afternoon. \"But we\u2019re not ruling anything out.\"\n\nDetectives believe the women may have applied for asylum in the United States after alleging that they were victims of abuse, Shea said.\n\nThe medical examiner's office will ultimately determine the causes of death as the investigation continues.\n\nNYPD\n\nA witness told police he saw the women in a park on West 158th Street in Upper Manhattan on the morning of Oct. 24, while he was out exercising. They were sitting about 30 feet apart with their heads in their hands and appeared to be praying, the witness said.\n\nThe bodies of Tala Farea, 16, and Rotana Farea, 22, were seen floating along the Hudson River that afternoon, police said.\n\nThe sisters, whose bodies were loosely bound together with duct tape, were found lying on rocks near the river, fully-clothed, both wearing black jackets with fur trim and black leggings. There were no obvious signs of trauma, and detectives believe the women were alive when they entered the water, according to police.\n\nTheir bodies are believed to have washed ashore with the tide and stayed when it went out, police said.\n\nNYPD detectives are checking to see if any surveillance cameras captured the moment Tala and Rotana Farea entered the river. They are also trying to determine whether either of them had met with any counselors or therapists in recent weeks, two police sources told ABC News.\n\nWABC\n\nThe Royal Consulate General of Saudi Arabia in New York confirmed in a statement Tuesday that the Farea sisters were students accompanying their brother in Washington, D.C.\n\nPolice investigators have traveled to Virginia, where they conducted various interviews with relatives and other associates of the Farea sisters to learn more about them. Shea has said those interviews are \"unraveling\" what was going on in the women's lives before their mysterious deaths.\n\nTala and Rotana Farea were, for a time, living with family in Fairfax, Virginia, but the relatives hadn't seen them since Nov. 30, 2017, according to Shea.\n\nAfter raising allegations of abuse, the sisters were placed in a domestic violence shelter in Virginia in December 2017. They went missing from that facility on Aug. 24, which was the last time they were both seen in Virginia, Shea said.\n\nNew York Police Department\n\nThrough mostly electronic evidence, such as credit card transactions and ATM withdrawals, detectives have determined that Tala and Rotana Farea used various transportation to travel from Fairfax to Washington, D.C., then to Philadelphia and on to New York City, where they arrived on Sept. 1.\n\nInvestigators are reviewing hotel and restaurant records, surveillance footage, electronic statements as well as eyewitness accounts to determine what the sisters were doing and where they were staying in New York City between Sept. 1 and Oct. 24, when their bodies were discovered in the Hudson River.\n\nIt appears the sisters stayed at a number of \"high-end\" hotels, ordered at least two meals a day and went shopping, Shea said. Surveillance video recorded just a week before they were found dead shows the pair looking to be in good health and not in any distress. However, their credit card was \"maxed out,\" according to Shea.\n\n\"There is a strong possibility here,\" Shea said, \"that money was running out.\"\n\nAnyone with information about the Farea sisters is urged to call the New York City Police Department's Crime Stoppers hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS.\n\nABC News' Kaelyn Forde and Emily Shapiro contributed to this report.", "bad url", "\"I fight on because that is what you told me I had to do,\" she wrote.", "bad url", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "Actor Alec Baldwin has been charged with misdemeanor assault and harassment after he punched someone during what officials described as a dispute near his home in New York City's Greenwich Village, ABC News has confirmed.\n\nBaldwin is expected to appear in court on Nov. 26.\n\nA representative for the actor had no comment.\n\nBaldwin, 60, has faced legal trouble in the Big Apple in the past.\n\n\u201c \u201d I wish him luck.\n\nIn 2014, after a New York City police officer issued him a summons him for riding his bike the wrong way on a one-way street, Baldwin allegedly said, \"I don't have identification.

Add Interest\n\nThese are the remaining sanctions lifted under the nuclear deal, reached under former President Obama, that targeted Iran's oil sector, financial transactions and banks, and shipping and ship-building industries -- seeking to cut off the regime's revenue sources and change its behavior, according to Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who previewed the actions to reporters Friday.\n\nRaheb Homavandi/Reuters, FILE\n\nPresident Trump teased the sanctions, which go into effect after midnight in the early hours of Monday, November 5. Seeming to make light of the situation, he tweeted out a \"Game of Thrones\"-inspired graphic of himself with a play on the show's tagline, \"Winter is coming.\"\n\nMonday's sanctions not only will bring back those in place under the Obama administration, but will include 300 more new targets, per Mnuchin, and far fewer exemptions for countries importing Iranian oil, per Pompeo.\n\n\"We are sending a very clear message with our maximum pressure campaign that the U.S. intends to aggressively enforce our sanctions,\" warned Mnuchin.\n\n\"Maximum pressure means maximum pressure,\" Pompeo added, touting the success of U.S. sanctions already: Over 100 major companies have withdrawn their business from Iran, and Iranian oil exports have dropped by nearly 1 million barrels a day, which has a strong impact as 80 percent of regime's funds come from oil.\n\nFunds from those purchases of Iranian oil will also be held in escrow accounts, and Iran will only be able to use them to purchase humanitarian goods like food and medicine or trade in non-sanctioned industries, Pompeo said.\n\nThat means \"Iran will have zero oil revenue to spend on any of these things,\" he added, referencing Iran's \"malign\" activity like cyber attacks, ballistic missiles, and support for terror groups or proxy militias in the Middle East.\n\nBoth men dismissed European Union efforts to bypass sanctions with a \"special purpose vehicle\" that would allow financial transactions, with Mnuchin saying the U.S. will \"aggressively\" target anyone \"evading our sanctions\" and Pompeo saying the majority of European businesses have already left. But both declined to comment on how the daylight with European governments could negatively impact U.S. diplomacy.\n\nThere are some skeptics on the right, however, who say these sanctions do not go far enough: There will be eight countries given exemptions from the oil sanctions, and the administration will not immediately sanction SWIFT, a financial consortium that allows banks to send financial transactions.\n\nRonen Zvulun/Reuters, FILE\n\nBut Mnuchin, who blamed any criticism on \"misinformation,\" said SWIFT \"could be subject to sanctions\" if it facilitates transactions with \"certain designated Iranian institutions\" -- a full list of which will be released Monday. The Trump administration issued that warning to banks, but it's unclear how far they will be willing to go on that.\n\nPompeo said the eight countries with oil exemptions will also be named on Monday, but that the European Union was not one of them. He added that these countries will be required to continue to reduce their Iranian oil imports when the exemptions are expired, and the number is fewer than under the Obama administration.\n\nThat seemed to be enough to quell any conservative criticism. United Against Nuclear Iran, a group with close ties to the Trump administration who have pushed for full sanctions implementation, was muted in knocking the announcement: \"We encourage the Trump administration to fulfill the promise of a maximum pressure campaign -- no exceptions -- until Iran permanently and verifiably changes its behavior,\" chairman Joe Lieberman, the former independent senator, and CEO Mark Wallace, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said in a joint statement.\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\nIran has not responded to the Trump administration sanctions announcement but has previously condemned U.S. sanctions as violations of the nuclear deal.\n\nBut proponents of the nuclear deal were far more critical, pointing to how the U.S. is imposing sanctions alone, in particular.\n\nThe administration \"is relying on economic pressure that will necessarily be less comprehensive than what President Obama achieved by working with a broad international coalition that included Iran's most important trading partners,\" Jarrett Blanc, who was the deputy lead coordinator and State Department coordinator for Iran nuclear implementation under Obama, said in a statement Thursday. Without those international partners, in particular the European Union, it will be more difficult to plug the gaps as Iran tries to evade sanctions -- something they have a history of doing skillfully, experts told ABC News.\n\nBut Trump's supporters say even without Europe, the level of pressure from the U.S. is greater than before, and that could eventually drive Iran to the negotiating table.\n\n\"The million-dollar question is how much revenue do we have to strip away before [Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah] Khamenei drinks from the poisoned chalice again?\" said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies -- a reference to Iran's first Supreme Leader calling his agreement to a ceasefire to the Iran-Iraq War as \"a poisoned chalice.\"\n\nThat pressure push is \"underwritten by the assumption, which has been proven correct on a handful of occasions, that 'Iran doesn\u2019t negotiate under pressure, it negotiates under massive pressure,'\" Taleblu added.\n\nBut negotiations do not seem likely to happen any time soon, with Iran defiant in the face of U.S. pressure. Some analysts warn that if anything, Iran in the short-term may expand its activity in the Middle East to poke the Trump administration in the eye, and sanctions will empower hardliners like the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps by forcing more of the economy into the shadows.\n\n\"Unless the Iranians feel that what is happening within Iran is becoming problematic, I don't see them changing their behavior,\" said Amb. Dennis Ross, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations. He added that if the pressure did get too great, they may look for a way out -- not with the U.S., but other members of the nuclear deal like Russia.\n\n\"Most likely, they think they can play for time and outlast Trump,\" he said.\n\nABC News's Sarah Kolinovsky contributed to this report.", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "Coverage of the 2018 Midterms on ABC News Live\n\nGet full 2018 Midterm Election coverage on ABC News Live starting Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. ET at ABCNews.com/Live, on the ABC News apps, and on Roku, Hulu and Watch.\n\nABC News Live will provide continuous coverage until Wednesday, November 7th at 2 a.m. ET, accessible login-free.\n\nYour Voice, Your Vote 2018 on ABC\n\nAt 8 p.m. ET, the Your Voice, Your Vote 2018 telecast begins on the ABC Television network.

Add Interest\n\n\u201cThis is going to be the most secure election we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Nielsen told the audience at a Council on Foreign Relations event on Friday. \u201cBut as we all know, this is a dynamic threat, it changes by the minute.\u201d\n\nNielsen said that \u201cas of today,\u201d DHS has not seen a coordinated attempt by a foreign government to interfere in American voting infrastructure, such as voter databases, polling systems and voting machines, but pledged to notify state and local officials \u201cthe moment that changes.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone should vote. Everyone should feel confident that state and local [officials] are doing everything they can to secure the infrastructure,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause a very important thing here is the adversary wins if we don\u2019t vote, right?\u201d\n\nNielsen acknowledged that U.S. election systems are under \u201cconstant attack.\u201d Ahead of the 2016 election, hackers linked to Russia scanned or probed election infrastructure in all 50 states, DHS officials said, though they aren\u2019t believed to have manipulated any records. This year, Nielsen said, there were only a few \u201cvery limited cases\u201d of access -- not attributed to a foreign campaign -- that had to be \u201cmitigated.\u201d\n\nAndrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images, FILE\n\nJohn Cohen, former acting under secretary for intelligence and analysis at DHS, warned that the apparent lack of cyber activity targeting infrastructure could be misleading. After all, he said, professional hackers likely would\u2019ve changed their tactics since 2016.\n\n\u201cWhile they\u2019re not seeing the same type of scanning activity, [cyber officials] weren\u2019t expecting to. That\u2019s not how hackers in general, and in particular foreign intelligence services, operate,\u201d said Cohen, now an ABC News contributor. \u201cIf they\u2019ve penetrated a network, they\u2019ve developed a whole new way to do it.\u201d\n\nWhile the U.S. government has made progress in securing its systems to cyberattacks, Cohen said he\u2019s not \u201cat all\u201d as optimistic as Nielsen seems to be about the upcoming election.\n\nWhat Nielsen and Cohen, do agree on, however, is that the Russians appear to have continued the online influence operation to spread propaganda, disinformation and incendiary rhetoric that allegedly targeted the 2016 elections.\n\nU.S. officials and experts have seen, however, a continuation of the Russia-linked online influence campaign to spread propaganda, disinformation and incendiary rhetoric that allegedly targeted the 2016 elections.\n\nLast month, the Justice Department indicted a Russian national for her alleged role in the conspiracy, and court papers detailed how the Russians allegedly passed themselves off as Americans on Facebook, Twitter and elsewhere to \u201csow division and discord in the U.S. political system, including by creating social and political polarization, undermining faith in democratic institutions, and influencing U.S. elections, including the upcoming 2018 midterm election.\u201d\n\nBrendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nNielsen said such online influence operations were \u201cvery pernicious\u201d and \u201cmuch more difficult to get our hands around\u201d than the effort to secure election infrastructure. The FBI has taken lead on battling the disinformation online, but Nielsen said much of the strategy comes down to \u201ceducating\u201d the American public to consider the source of the information they\u2019re reading.\n\n\u201cWe need to continue as a country to figure out how to combat that part,\u201d she said.\n\nShe is worried, she said, that even the suggestion of irregularities on or after election night could undermine confidence in the process.\n\n\u201cMy biggest concern,\u201d Nielsen said, \u201cis that a foreign entity will take the opportunity after the election or the night of the election to attempt to sow discord through social media by suggesting that something did not work as it should in a certain area.\u201d\n\nInformation operations experts recently described to ABC News the difficulty in fighting the online disinformation campaigns, as foreign and domestic trolls and bots continuously evolved to skirt new security policies implemented by social media companies.\n\n\u201cSo now the people at the first line of defense are the people at the tech platforms and what they\u2019re going to find is as they change the state of play, as they change the rules a little bit, the adversary is going to evolve and respond,\u201d said Renee DiResta, director of research at the Austin, Texas-based cybersecurity firm New Knowledge. \u201cThis is going to be an arms race that\u2019s going to play out kind of for the indefinite future.\u201d", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "In the final video of our special Disney Moms Panel series, Jerry, our Disney Parks Moms Panelist and Disney Vacation Club Member, is back one more time to share how he and his family get the most out of their Disney Vacation Club membership, which starts by understanding how to get the most out of your points.

Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nJust two in 10 say Trump is acting to discourage violence; 15 percent say the media are.\n\nSee PDF for full results, charts and tables.\n\nABC NEWS\n\nThe national survey, which comes during a period of heightened tensions ahead of the midterms, also finds the Democratic Party leading the Republicans in trust to handle \u201creducing divisions between people and groups,\u201d by a substantial 15-point margin, 46-31 percent. Seventeen percent volunteer that they don\u2019t trust either party, a high level for this response.\n\nSixty-nine percent in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, call reducing the country\u2019s divisions a highly important issue in their vote for Congress next week.\n\nAfter a fraught period including mail bombs sent to Trump critics and the apparent hate-crime murders of 11 congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue and of a black man and woman at a Kentucky grocery store, the survey\u2019s results on Trump and the media are dispiriting:\n\n\u2022 Forty-nine percent say the way Trump speaks encourages political violence, while a mere 19 percent see him as discouraging it. Twenty-nine percent say he\u2019s neither encouraging nor discouraging violence \u2013 a subject on which neutrality is not a positive attribute.\n\n\u2022 Trump, for his part, has blamed the media for contributing to \u201canger and division\u201d in the country, and 47 percent in this survey say the way the media report the news encourages politically motivated violence. Only 15 percent say the media are discouraging such violence; 33 percent say they\u2019re neither encouraging nor discouraging it.\n\nABC NEWS\n\nSixteen percent see fault on both sides; they say both Trump and the media encourage violence.\n\nGroups\n\nViews on Trump and the media are highly partisan. Seventy-six percent of Democrats say Trump encourages violence in the way he speaks; 19 percent of Republicans agree. Even among Republicans, though, just one-third say Trump\u2019s approach discourages violence.\n\nThe White House, for its part, called it \"outrageous\" to blame the president for the synagogue attack and mail bomb spree and Trump suggested the media was to blame for the anger in the country.\n\nOn the media, these numbers are essentially reversed: Sixty-nine percent of Republicans say the way the media report the news encourages politically motivated violence; 24 percent of Democrats agree. Just 19 percent of Democrats say the media discourage violence, similar to the share of Republicans who say so.\n\nIn the middle, as is typical, are political independents: Half see blame for Trump, and half also see blame for the media.\n\nDivisions between conservatives and liberals are similar to what they are among Republicans and Democrats. In the sharpest difference, 83 percent of liberal Democrats say the way Trump speaks encourages violence, while just 17 percent of conservative Republicans agree. And 74 percent of conservative Republicans think the way the media report the news encourages violence, while only 16 percent of liberal Democrats see it that way.\n\nABC NEWS\n\nIn another sharp division, 68 percent of blacks see Trump as encouraging violence in the way he speaks; many fewer whites, but still 45 percent, say the same. And 51 percent of whites see the media as encouraging violence in the way they report the news; that falls to 30 percent of blacks.\n\nOn the question of trust to handle reducing divisions between people and groups, partisan and ideological divisions again are quite sharp, but the Democrats are notably competitive in some groups. In red states, those that backed Trump in 2016, 41 percent of registered voters pick the Democratic Party as better to reduce divisions, while 36 percent choose the GOP. Among white Catholics, a group Trump won by 23 percentage points in 2016, it\u2019s 43-39 percent. In districts in which congressional seats are in play, it\u2019s 44-35 percent. And in suburban areas it\u2019s 46-30 percent.\n\nEighty percent of Democrats call reducing divisions highly important in their vote; so do 68 percent of independents, and 61 percent of Republicans \u2013 lower among Republicans than in all but two groups, college-educated white men and \u201csomewhat\u201d conservatives.\n\nMethodology\n\nThis ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone Oct. 29-Nov. 1, 2018, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,255 adults, including 1,041 registered voters. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points for the sample of registered voters, including the design effect.

Appeared to be at record highs Karen Travers is outside the White House four's Karen another president has been hitting the campaign trail hard. And he seems to have settled on the closing argument. That is our closing argument from the president Diane is focused entirely. On illegal immigration the president talking about what the White House says is a crisis at the border and the White House is hoping that this issue revs up Republicans and that's why he's see him out there everyday image handling traffic and now siren the White House also talking about this issue yesterday the president made a series of statements on this. Take a listen to what he had to say. Get to be overrun by mass is of illegal aliens. And giant caravans you better vote Republican these courageous Americans. Did not shed their blood sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others tried to erase their legacy dare doubt our history. And destroy our proud American Heritage we did do that. So this isn't an innocent group of people. It's a large number of people that are tough. They've injured they've attacked. And the Mexican police and military has actually suffers. And I appreciate what Mexico's trying to did we're putting up. Massive cities of tents the military is helping us incredibly well. I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers have been so. Efficient so good so talented. We have thousands of tents we have a lot of tense we have a lot of everything that I hold them right there we're not letting them into our. A country. And the president making that argument very crystal clear in his view if Americans don't want this country overrun by what he says are illegal aliens and caravans. You have to get out and vote Republican each day it's also interesting as a big jobs report out today positive numbers big big month of October the White House is calling it incredible but that is not the centerpiece of what the president is saying on the campaign trail and many critics are saying he's talking about this caravan and -- immigrants to stoke fear to really scare monger people and get the mount to the polls based on what could be false statements. Yet camera to talk whether jobs report with a record terrorism just a little bit isn't using that the president. Isn't focusing on that but there seems to be allowed to unpack in what he's. Actually saying you know with the exception of native Americans we are a country of immigrants so what does he mean. When he's talking about people destroying our heritage are racing our legacy. Now that's it people and now it's a good question to the president is talking about this in broad brush strokes but clearly trying to rile people up to make people convinced that there's this invasion coming to the US Mexico border that's he's referred to this and in the Asia and and that's needing a military response the president first talking about a 5000 troop deployment now considering upping that number to about 151000. In yesterday today and the president was asked if there is any scenario where he can see. Those troops. Firing on these migrants he said that if they throw rocks than the military would respond but of course that's been something that's been disputed about. Who these people are it's family it's it's it's moms with children it's not this aggressive band that people the F heading straight to the US border. Well there's something else he said which is that in of people in the caravan have attacked. And the Mexican police and military have suffered those are the president's words what's he referring to there. Yet he's referring to some of the skirmishes that we've seen but and our reporting from down there has been and that's not defining these groups of people as they're making their way through Mexico but that does not seem to matter the president right now he is keying in on that to justify his use sending the military down to the bordering again this all gets back to using here as a motivate her to get people to the polls instead of using the John's report instead of using health care. This is the message to the president has centered on each and I think it's also notable yesterday the president was talking about an executive order I going after asylum seekers this is not something he signed yesterday it's not something that's finalized he says he's still working on it but Diane the president came out yesterday to say that going forward only people that crossed the border lawfully at official points of entry will be allowed to seek political asylum that will be a big change from the current law but again notable he didn't find anything that didn't happen yesterday that he certainly wanting to come out yesterday talk about it very forcefully and use it as another critical talking points to get people out to the polls. Frank Karen Travers from outside the White House thanks Karen.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Transcript for Google workers call for culture change on harassment\n\nNow onto that worldwide walkout at Google thousands of employees are protesting the waving say the company handles sexual harassment.

Or Mecca what's the big. Headline here the headline here Diana's that this was a very strong jobs report 250000. Jobs added in the month of October. The unemployment rate remains steady at three point 7% that is the lowest level since 1969. And the biggest thing in this report that analysts like is the wage growth three point 1% wage growth. An hourly earnings over the last year that's the best wage growth since before the recession began so that's what people are looking for they want to know what's in their paycheck we also know. That there are now more job openings than there are people looking for jobs and if you look in the details of the report there are some very interesting findings for one. The job gains are overall across industry groups manufacturing. Construction. Warehousing trucking even mining adding jobs in the month of October. Women interestingly enough have a lower unemployment rate just slightly fractionally lower unemployment rate than men do in the country and women are gaining jobs. At a faster pace than matter gaining jobs but Diane overall a very strong report so. No market has been pretty volatile lately does this mean we can now. Cue up the ban insanity saying he's happy to hear again not exactly now it's it's it's is the interesting thing you look at the stock market and a lot of people. Confuse the stock market with the economy the stock market is not the economy the economy is what's happening how we're feeling about things how we're spending and frankly. Consumers with wages rising should be feeling pretty good about the state of the economy of course you've gotten ask a single consumer. It's all about their job their life their house and that can really change depending on who you're speaking to gunman in his jobs aquarium is a better indicator than just looking at the stock market is some is yes actually but in some ways it's a lagging indicator because it's looking backwards as opposed to looking forward to it's really important that the section of the year that were heading into.

They could open fire let's listen to some of his statements. He won't he won't. Which the military I hope I hope there won't be then. But I will tell you this anybody throwing stones rocks we will consider that a firearm. Because is not much difference they want to throw rocks at our military military fights back. We're getting considered I jump consider rifles. Want to bring in our Louis Martinez to get his reaction on that -- what do we know so far about the president's plan with these troops in what they're actually at the border to do. Welding and they are not dealing law enforcement that is and that is the role of Customs and Border Protection at CBP. They're the ones are gonna have officers on the border have officers right there they're the ones interject my migrants as they come across the border. The US military acted each consider being sent what they're doing is they are providing support logistical support technical support. They're going to be doing construction they're going to be building vehicle barriers are going to be. My erecting some fencing. And they're gonna be constructing some tents to house additional CBP personnel not migrants. I'm so what the president is talking about here is slightly different if not very different from what US military officials have been telling us here about what the role is of the military. When he says is that Iraq may be considered firearms. That would be let's call that the rules of engagement while what officials call the use of force. There are set rules in place for wind military service members can use force in response Q it proportional threat. So when there is a threat. You use proportions it starts with nonlethal and in a news forward potentially. To a different level by I since it is the military will not be involved in law enforcement I don't see a scenario where they're going to be actually that close to the migrants. So when the president says that they may fire back and I'm decide clear how that could happen. But either way. They have rules of force would not call for that it to happen immediately because again it's a proportional. Response I'm not an immediate then go to firearms differently Martinez from ABC news that the Pentagon we appreciate it thanks.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Transcript for Migrant caravan, The World Series, crisis in Yemen: World in Photos\n\nAnd.

Add Midterm Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Midterm Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nA judge denied a North Dakota tribe's emergency motion to block the state from implementing a key part of its strict new voter ID law just a few days ahead of the midterms, citing the confusion such a change could cause ahead of the \"fast approaching\" elections.\n\n\"The federal courts are unanimous in their judgment that it is highly important to preserve the status quo when elections are fast approaching,\" U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland wrote in the order denying the emergency motion. Hovland also wrote that the details provided by the Spirit Lake Tribe in the complaint provided \"great cause for concern\" and would require \"a detailed response from the Secretary of State as this case proceeds,\" but maintained that \"a further injunction on the eve of the election will create as much confusion as it will alleviate, and is foreclosed by precedent which is hesitant to permit 'eleventh-hour changes to election laws.'\"\n\nThe voter ID law, which requires all North Dakotan voters to provide a state- or tribe-issued ID with a residential address in order to vote, has been the subject of legal back-and-forth for years because Native American tribes hold that it disproportionately affects Native Americans who live in rural communities on reservations and often don't use residential addresses, but rely instead on post office box addresses to get their mail. According to studies commissioned by Native American rights groups, roughly 35 percent of that population doesn't have an acceptable ID with a residential address.\n\nHovland, the judge who denied Tuesday's emergency motion from the tribe, is the same judge who ruled twice that the voter ID law was placing an undue burden on Native Americans attempting to exercise their right to vote. His ruling was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and the U.S. Supreme Court allowed that decision to stay in place about a month before the election.\n\nOn its own, Spirit Lake Tribe estimates it had more than 200 people living on the reservation without residential street addresses. According to the motion filed Tuesday, voters have already had their absentee ballots rejected because of confusion around the new law and \"the problem threatens hundreds if not thousands more on Election Day,\" the plaintiffs wrote.\n\nDan Koeck/Reuters\n\nTribes have been working to secure proper IDs for members by printing new ones and holding events to raise awareness, like a free benefit concert last weekend including musician Dave Matthews and actor Mark Ruffalo. According to data from the state\u2019s four largest tribes and affiliated groups, at least 2,000 people have been issued new IDs by tribes.\n\nTuesday's emergency motion, and the judge's denial Thursday adds to a growing concern in the state that Native American voters will be disproportionately affected by the new voter ID law, but there are also potential political ramifications. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a vulnerable Democrat running for re-election in a state Trump won handily in 2016, won by a narrow margin of under 3,000 votes in 2012 and had overwhelming support from Native American populations in North Dakota.\n\nABC News' Roey Hadar, Lauren Pearle and Stephanie Wash contributed to this report.", "Stocks are closing sharply lower on Wall Street, pulled down by more steep losses in big technology companies.

Twanesa Howard told ABC News.\n\nFulton County Sheriff\u2019s Office\n\nThe case dates back to the morning of May 25, 1997, when Smith's parents made a gruesome discovery: their daughter was dead in her bedroom, shot several times in the back, the Fulton County Police said.\n\nHer father, James Smith, had gone to wake his daughter up for church, he told ABC Atlanta affiliate WSB last year.\n\nWhen he opened the door \"she was in her blood on the floor,\" he said. \"I thought that was the end of me right there.\"\n\nSmith fought back during the attack and \"a significant amount of the suspect\u2019s blood was found in the home,\" police said.\n\nAs authorities investigated, they found no sign of forced entry, robbery or sexual assault.\n\nYears went by without an arrest. Then this year, through genetic genealogy testing, police found a familial match to the suspect, Howard said. As that match was narrowed down, police identified Lee as the closet living relative; no other relatives lived in that area at that time, Howard said.\n\nPolice obtained a search warrant to collect the DNA of Lee, who was was still living less than a mile away from the victim.\n\nLee's DNA was collected and submitted to state investigators, who compared his DNA to the DNA from the crime scene. A match was found.\n\nLee had no felony criminal record, Howard said. In Georgia only a convicted felon's DNA is entered into the system, she said.\n\n\"Despite a reward of more than $30,000 and DNA tests conducted on more than 100 individuals over the last 21 years, police had been unable to positively identify the suspect until this week,\" Fulton County Police said in a news release.\n\nLee was arrested at a hotel in Alabama and then brought to Georgia on Thursday and booked at the Fulton County Jail.\n\nHe was charged with murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, according to records.\n\nHe was due to make his first court appearance on Friday. It was not immediately clear if he had an attorney.\n\n\"We have some relief,\" the Smith family said in a statement to WSB. \"One chapter has closed, but there are new ones opening with trials, sentencing and all that we will be learning about the next phase of the process.\"", "HEJM\n\nArchitect Jochen Klein has spent nearly two decades working alongside star designer Daniel Libeskind.\n\nHe led the project teams in creating the Military History Museum in Dresden and the Jewish Museum Berlin Academy, the 25,000-square-foot tilted cube building located across the street from the acclaimed Jewish Museum Berlin. He also managed the design and construction of Sapphire, Libeskind\u2019s first residential building in Berlin.\n\nBut when Klein took on a solo residential project in Berlin\u2019s Prenzlauer Berg district, it quickly became clear that he would be creating his own architectural footprint.\n\n35BLN, a 43 unit luxury apartment project designed by Klein, includes a minimalist aesthetic characterized by a mix of modern industrial materials and historic authenticity.\n\nThe 19th-century structure was carefully renovated in a clean, modern design with steel girders, barrel ceilings, and preserved historic window and door arches. Lofts at the building are grouped around several courtyards while distinctive interior features include whitewashed red brickwork, concrete flooring, and fine Italian glass mosaic.\n\nThe goal, Klein says, was to develop an architectural language that focuses on the soul of a project.\n\n\u201cWhat captured my imagination right from the start was the building\u2019s factory-like appearance \u2013 its historic brick walls, and its amazing spaciousness,\u201d says Klein, who studied architecture in Berlin and New York before joining Libeskind. He eventually headed the firm's Zurich office, where he built the futuristic shopping mall Westside in Bern, Switzerland. \u201cFrom this arose the vision of consistently juxtaposing the historic structures with modern architecture.\u201d\n\nHEJM\n\nEvery single apartment in the project is a unique creation, Klein says.\n\nThe units range in size from roughly 45 to 284 square meters - or 500 to over 3,000 square foot. Ceiling heights soar up to 4 meters - or more than 13-foot high. Prices for the apartments start at \u20ac 6,600 to \u20ac 12,000 per square meter.\n\nThe apartments are offset with generously designed loggias, balconies and roof terraces, some with garden areas. The homes have modern floor designs with light-grey poured-concrete floors or oak parquet flooring with floorboards of up to 26 cm wide.\n\n\u201cWe broke up the traditional floor plans and radically restructured them in order to create open and fluid spaces,\u201d he says, referring to the clean interior design concept. \u201cWe breathed new life into the historic structures and complemented them with fresh building materials.\u201d\n\nThe project\u2019s landscaping was created by Thilo Folkerts, a noted Berlin landscape architect who has been creating experimental garden concepts for nearly two decades.\n\nHEJM\n\nThe project sits in Prenzlauer Berg, a bustling district in the heart of the German capital that is one of the city\u2019s most charismatic residential neighborhoods, filled with cafes, historic buildings and indie boutiques.\n\nAnother unique aspect of the project is its method of sales. The apartments are only being sold once they have been completed. This means that buyers are not purchasing a concept on paper but instead a fully designed apartment.\n\n\u201cIn the end, the old and the new come together in wondrous harmony,\u201d adds Klein. \u201cIt\u2019s a very special project that I\u2019d happily move in myself.\u201d\n\nHEJM\n\n35BLN arrives as Berlin continues to be one of the most robust real estate markets in Europe.\n\nFew places have enjoyed a more dramatic rise in investment over the past decade, with home prices seeing double-digit price growth since 2010, according to city data.\n\nIn the last year alone average residential property prices rose 20.7%, according to real-estate consultants Knight Frank, the fastest rate of all global cities it surveyed.\n\nToday nearly every corner of the city is awash in new real estate developments, ranging from soaring luxury condominiums towers to fully renovated pre-war buildings. Many of the new properties boast prices and upscale amenities virtually unthinkable in a city that was once deemed \u201cpoor but sexy\u201d by its mayor.\n\nThe real estate boom is being fueled, in part, by the city\u2019s growing population coupled with a severe shortage of new homes, analysts say. International buyers from across Europe and Asia have also flooded Berlin in recent years, lifting home prices and the city\u2019s profile as a place to invest.\n\nKlein says his project will appeal to a maturing cadre of Berlin homebuyers now flocking to the city.\n\n\u201cThe city is now attracting more buyers who are looking for something unique, and full of character,\u201d he says. \u201cThis project will appeal to people looking for this special design and architecture.\u201d", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "Transcript for Google employees lead global walkout\n\nWe turn out to know worldwide walked out and Google thousands of workers have walked off the job to protest how the company handles sexual harassment.

That wasn\u2019t a problem in years past because there were other ways to prove your residency, like signing an affidavit or having a poll worker vouch for you.\n\nBut in 2013, the state legislature did away with those options -- making it harder to vote, especially for Native Americans who live on reservations.\n\n\u201cWe have not been fully colonized to put everything in square streets and boxes,\u201d said Phyllis Young, a Native American rights activist. \u201cWe live openly.

And to me, I have no regrets.\u201d\n\nShe won her seat in 2012 by about 3,000 votes, so she\u2019s keenly aware that every vote counts.\n\n\u201cThe first thing you have to be concerned about is that people who have the right to vote won\u2019t be able to vote,\u201d Heitkamp says of the voting law.\n\nJaeger denies that voter ID law was designed to disenfranchise Native Americans.\n\n\u201cI can look you straight in the eye and I will tell you nothing has ever happened in this office to target anybody,\u201d Jaeger said.\n\nBut just this week, one of the tribes -- along with six individuals -- took emergency legal action to seek relief from the proof of residential address requirement for Native Americans who live on or near reservations.\n\nAnd across the state, activists are trying to rally local and national support.\n\nPrairie Rose Seminole, a Native American rights activist addressed voters in the state: \u201cWhat we want to do is really inform people about their power as voters here ... and the effect of this law really has created disparity for American Indian voters.\u201d\n\nSeminole is helping raise awareness about the new ID requirements with a massive \u201cGet Out The Vote\u201d concert headlined by Matthews.\n\nGabriel Llfton-Zoline\n\n\u201cPeople brought their disappointment and their hopelessness here to stand with them,\" Matthews said. \u201cIt's remarkable how successfully they've, and how gracefully they've, come out that so far.\u201d\n\nMatthews, the two-time Grammy winner, began working with Standing Rock before the Dakota Access Pipeline conflict, adopting the local elementary school through a Kennedy Center Arts program.\n\nHe says the community has had to lead by example twice in recent years.\n\n\u201cI'm very grateful to have witnessed that,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cIt was a very difficult thing for this community to be so much in the spotlight of the world, and have so much hope thrust upon them and to be the bearers of so much anguish from all over the world -- because people brought their disappointment and their hopelessness here to stand with them. ... It's remarkable how successfully they've, and how gracefully they've, come out that so far.\u201d\n\nRuffalo, who stars in Marvel's cinematic universe as Bruce Banner, is also putting his star power behind the issue.\n\nGabriel Llfton-Zoline\n\n\u201cI happen to have a little spotlight that follows me around whether I like it or not, whether it's fair or not,\u201d Ruffalo explained. \u201cSometimes I get to put the most beautiful people in that spotlight to tell the truth, and for the world to hear from the people that need to be heard from right now. So that's why I'm here.\n\n\u201cWe've been screaming and hollering for a long time,\u201d he added.\n\nSeminole weighed in on Ruffalo\u2019s presence at the protests: \u201cFor Mark and others to use their agency to amplify our voices -- that's powerful and we feel then we're valued and we're heard and we can actually move the dial into a better future for all of us.\u201d\n\nSeminole says \u201cthe system has failed\u201d the Native American population of North Dakota, but says \u201cwe can't change it unless we show up. ... When we start showing up, nothing apparently stops us all. That's what gives me hope and I'm going to keep fighting for.\u201d", "Transcript for Bernie Sanders on what it'll take for a 'blue wave' to hit Congress\n\nReporter: Maybe the junior senator from Vermont. If I were a Republican looking out at this crowd, I would be very nervous. Reporter: For this crowd here in Wisconsin, he's a rock star. Senator Bernie Sanders has been making the rounds in lots of states ahead of the midterms. It looks to me like Oceanside is ready for a political revolution. Reporter: The white hair, the rumpled suit, and that unmistakable accent. I'm here today to end one party rule in Washington. Reporter: A gentle reminder of what might have been and maybe, just maybe, could be still. Got a lively crowd here. Oh, yeah. Reporter: Backstage in Kenosha, talking strategy with Illinois congressional candidate Garcia, Sanders down plays the idea of a big blue wave. Anybody thinks this is going to be easy, the Democrats are going to end up with a 20-vote majority, is absolutely dead wrong. The Republicans can still hang on. They can still win this thing. Reporter: He's doing everything in his power to get out the vote. The Kenosha venue is a uaw hall, blue-collar voters one and all. What is it that Bernie Sanders brings to the table when it comes to an event like this? Excitement and vision for the future. Reporter: Voters here fit the same profile as the ones that helped Donald Trump win Wisconsin on the promise of America first. You don't see me with a hat on me that says make America whatever again. Reporter: They're all for protecting the steel industry, bringing back manufacturing jobs and helping America's farmers. They're just not for trump. No, we're not coming in as a blue wave. We're coming in as a blue tidal wave. Reporter: Tidal wave. As Bernie Sanders himself says, it all depends on the turnout. In 2014, we had the lowest voter turnout in modern American history. In 2018, with your help, we're going to have the highest voter turnout. Reporter: Sanders has never really stopped campaigning since 2016. Hello. Reporter: The quixotic campaign he launched for the presidency, tilting at windmills, ended up gathering an astonishing head of steam. Now Bernie's campaign has become a movement. Here's the radical idea. Are you ready? Here it comes. Maybe, just maybe, we should have a government that represents the needs of the middle class and working people of this country and not just wealthy campaign contributors. There you go. I know it's a radical statement. Hey, I'm going to stick to it. Reporter: Remember all those small dollar donations Sanders used to talk about during the 2016 campaign? And you know what that average contribution was? $27. Reporter: Turns out there was a lot of money left over, most of it rolled over into our revolution, a political action committee fielding some 200 Progressive candidates for state and local office. In the past few weeks, Sanders has criss crossed the country, ginning up support in 11 states, hoping he'll soon have some company on capitol hill. So in Indiana. We're going to come together and elect Liz Watson as the next congressperson. Reporter: In Colorado, states where he beat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Joe, your next member of the United States congress. Reporter: In Nevada. I'm here today to help elect Jackie to be the next united States senator from the great state of Nevada. Reporter: Finally, this week, in Florida. Your job is to elect Andrew Gillum. Your job is to have the highest voter turnout for a midterm election in Florida history. Around the country, there is a new generation of Bernie Sanders style candidates running, and even in red parts of the country, they want him to come campaign for them. Reporter: All told, since the 2016 election, he's visited 30 states. You have certainly made a dent in the democratic party. Now it seems like you're trying to make a real difference with a slate of candidates across the country for everything from the senate down to local elections. Who are you most excited about in that crowd? Well, we have great candidates. Reporter: Democratic Randy Bryce is running in Wisconsin's first congressional district, the seat currently held by house speaker Paul Ryan. When you entered this race, I gather you were a bit of a sacrificeal lamb, you were the long shot and suddenly you're the front runner We've been able to put together something that hasn't been put together in the 20 years that Paul Ryan has been here. Reporter: Bryce is an iron worker by trade and a former volunteer on Bernie's 2016 campaign. I've heard they call you iron stache. I've been called that. Reporter: And I also read that your campaign not only supports unions but is unionized. We're the first in American politics to unionize, absolutely. With your help and with help from people all across this country, we were able to repeal Paul Ryan. All over this country, people like Randy who were never really involved in electoral politics before, you're seeing that. Young people, people of color, women, suddenly they are running for office and they are winning. So I think come November 6th, Washington, D.C., is going to be in for a big surprise. Reporter: The pendulum has swung to the right. There's no question about I. And I see that you want to swing it to the left. There are those who would say in a polarized, divided country, we ought to find common ground in the middle. Yeah, I think that's right and I think if you look at the issues that we're talking about, that is the common ground. And the American people very strongly want a government that represents them and not just the 1%. Reporter: So you're redefining the middle. Yeah. And it's not just me. Look at the polling. All these things that I'm telling you, that's what the American people want. Sanders points to the success of candidates like Alexandria ocasoi-cortez in Brooklyn, a young Progressive, now at age 29, poised to become the youngest member of congress, and he'd be the only democratic socialist in the house. Reporter: The issue is not just November 6th but also 2020. Does the democratic party have the bench needed to take trump? I think there are a lot of people out there who have experience, who have knowledge and who are prepared to take on the big money interests who dominate our economy and our political life. Reporter: Including Bernie Sanders? Well, I'm now focused on 2018. I'm working as hard as I can. Reporter: So he's not ruling it out. He's hiring back a lot of his old staff. He's starting to fund raise for himself and keep money in a war chest. He's going back to those early important states like Iowa and Nevada and New Hampshire. Reporter: But in 2020, he'll be 79, 9 years older than Donald Trump was when he took the oath of office, the oldest man ever elected president. There are folks, forgive me, who say Sanders, Biden, even Clinton, getting a bit long in the tooth. Time for fresh faces. I think what the media should be focusing on are the issues impacting the American people and the political leadership will follow that. Reporter: First things first, Sanders insists. There will be plenty of time to discuss that after the midterms. I'm David Wright for \"Nightline\" in Kenosha, Wisconsin.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "This holiday season, gift-givers may surprise loved ones with a present that will have them bursting with joy and smiling from ear to ear \u2013 an unforgettable Walt Disney World Resort experience.\n\nDisney has made it easy to surprise your loved ones this holiday season with the gift of theme park tickets, annual passes, resort hotel stays and Disney Gift Cards at GiveDisneyWorldMagic.com.

Seven cases of babies born with malformed arms in this same area between 2009 and 2014 were made public earlier this month.\n\nThe French public agency also revealed a few weeks ago that seven cases of babies born with malformed arms occurred between 2007 and 2013 in two regions located in western France.\n\nThis makes for a total of 25 cases now made public, causing public alarm and leading to the investigation.\n\nThe head of the Public Health France agency Fran\u00e7ois Bourdillon told RTL radio that the probe has begun and results should be known in about three months.\n\nDespite tests on the mothers to determine whether they were exposed to a common substance, no explanations have been discovered to explain the deformations, Bourdillon said.\n\n\"I want to know, I think all of France wants to know,\" French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn told French TV BFM on Wednesday. \"It could be an environmental factor. Maybe it is due to what these women ate, drank or breathed in.\"\n\nMembers of the French ecologists party and environmentalists have been pointing out to the fact that all the families affected by these malformations live in rural and agricultural areas and that pesticides could be the cause.\n\n\"Scientists have to prove that there are consequences using pesticides,\" the French agricultural minister Didier Guillaume told French media last week. \"Regarding the cases of babies born with no arms, science has to do its work,\" Guillaume added.\n\nIn a phone interview with ABC News, S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Aym\u00e9, a French medical geneticist and epidemiologist, said that there are no elements or scientific proof that pesticides are responsible for these malformations.\n\n\"This is just a hypothesis,\" she said.\n\nWhat are the possible causes? \"Genetic problems can be a reason, as well as tobacco, alcohol and drug consumption\" by pregnant mothers, Aym\u00e9 explained.\n\nDefects could also originate from all kinds of chemical products in our daily environment, according to the medical expert.\n\n\"What we eat, medicines we take, various pollutants such as solvents in cosmetic or painting products ... there are in these products agents that are toxic for the fetus,\" Aym\u00e9 added. \"The conjunction of these small factors all together can lead to a catastrophe such as a malformed arm.\"\n\nThis is what makes narrowing down what's caused the children to be born disfigured is so difficult, the geneticist added.\n\n\"That's why in 99 percent of the cases,\" she added, \"we don't know the specific causes of these malformations.

In 2017, he opted out of his contract, making him a free agent. Kaepernick currently remains unsigned for the 2018 season.\n\nIn May, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell introduced a policy that required players to stand during the national anthem, but would allow them to have the option of remaining in the locker room during the pregame performance if they choose to do so. The policy would ultimately fine teams for players who chose to sit or kneel during the anthem. The NFL, however, put the policy on hold for the 2018 season to allow for further discussion between the union and the league about the issue, according to ESPN.\n\nKaepernick's demonstrations continue to draw support from a number of athletes and other personnel in the NFL.\n\nGetty Images, FILE\n\nEarlier this season, Miami Dolphins wide receivers Kenny Stills and Albert Wilson knelt and defensive end Robert Quinn raised a clenched fist while \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" played before their game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Standing rock is in the center of the United States, and it's probably the heart of this country. Reporter: And most recently, this land, a political flash point. That highly publicized conflict over the Dakota access pipeline, the plight of these native Americans championed by advocates and celebrities like actor Mark Ruffalo and musician Dave Matthews. Everybody knows what they stood up against enormous odds to try and prevent this pipeline from going through. Peacefully, kindly, remarkably. Reporter: Now once again, this community is under the spotlight. Make sure you update your I.D., Patty. Reporter: This time, because of a new I.D. Law some say is intended to make it more difficult for residents here to vote just before the midterm election. As long as I get to the polls and I have to push and shove my way with a piece of paper, I'll get there. Reporter: About 60% of native Americans in North Dakota live on reservations where many residents lack street addresses because the U.S. Postal service does not provide them with residential delivery services, so many native Americans use a P.O. Box to receive their mail. But now in order to vote, you have to have a residential address. That didn't used to be a problem, because there were other ways to prove your residency, like signing an affidavit or having a poll worker vouch for you. But in 2013, the state legislature did away with those back-up options, making it harder to vote, especially for native Americans who live on reservations. We have not been fully colonized to put everything in square streets and boxes. Reporter: Phyllis young is a native American rights activist. We've lived openly and so now we're being forced to create streets and name addresses for our voting rights. Reporter: A legal battle over the new law ensued with the U.S. Supreme court upholding it on October 9th. Do you have your valid I.D. Or no? Reporter: Leaving the native American community scrambling to ensure residents have the proper identification to cast their vote. Do you guys need a ride out to vote or anything? No, we have a car. Reporter: Here at the get out the vote headquarters, a team has been working nonstop for weeks. They've got a valid I.D. For some of them. Some of these -- You got to go back. Okay. And we're going to mobilize our people like we've never mobilized before. It's a critical election nationwide. It's going to make a difference in the congress, in the leadership in this country. Reporter: Critics say it smacks of voter suppression, but secretary of state Alvin says the law was needed, that his office had difficulty verifying voter identities. There was about 3,600 that we couldn't on election day, 97% to 98% of the people that will come to vote will have a state issued I.D. And will be able to vote with no problem. That last 2% to 3%, we're doing everything we can to let their options be known. Reporter: That 2% to 3% affected, most likely native American voters, and because this group tends to vote for Democrats, the new voter I.D. Law matters a lot to senator Heidi Heitkamp. She's the only statewide elected Democrat in a deep red state. She's recently faced backlash for voting against the confirmation of supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh. I can't get up in the morning and look at the life experience that I've had and say yes to judge Kavanaugh. If it all comes down that decision for some voters, was was it worth it? Yep. I made a judgment based on what I saw and what I heard, and this is a judgment that's not just about the voters today. This is about 30 years of voters in North Dakota, 30 years of people, and to me, I have no regrets. Are you really? Oh my gosh. Reporter: Heitkamp won her seat in 2012 but roughly 3,000 votes so she's keenly aware that every vote counts. The first thing you have to be concerned about is that people who have a right to vote won't be able to vote. Reporter: Secretary of state Jaeger denies the voter I.D. Law was designed to disenfranchise native Americans. Nothing has ever happened in this office to target anybody. Reporter: But just this week, one of the tribes, along with six individuals, took emergency legal action, seeking relief from this requirement that native Americans who live on or near reservations prove a residential address. And across the state, activists are trying to rally local and national support. What we want to do is really inform people about their power as voters here in the state, and the effect of this laurel has created a disparity for American Indian voters. Reporter: Prairie rose Seminole is helping to raise awareness about the new I.D. Requirements. How much power do we have? Let me hear you. Reporter: With a massive get out the vote concert. Headlined by Dave Matthews. So let's vote and continue to fight so that we can try and turn it right. ?????? The people that are being affected by this law in north Dakota are people who have lived on this land for thousands of years. ??? Come out, come out, no use in hiding ??? The state is named after them. And they're being asked to prove, again, that this is their home. It is despicable. And I find it unforgivable. But it's the law. So, we have to deal with it. Reporter: Matthews began working withstanding rock before the Dakota access pipeline conflict, adopting the local elementary school he says now twice in recent years this community has had to lead by example. People brought their disappointment and their hopelessness here to stand with them, which is a weight which lifts you up and also is a burden, and it's remarkable how that so far. Introducing the great white Ruffalo. Reporter: Actor Mark Ruffalo is also putting his star power behind the issue. These people have a reason, plenty of reasons not to vote, and I get that, you know? But I will say this. Whoever wins, you better do right by these people for once. The system has failed us, but we can't change it unless we show up and when we start showing up, nothing can really stop us so that's what gives me hope and I'm going to keep fighting for it.

And crisis it will be in the frantic stretch to the midterms \u2013 with the president misconstruing the facts and history around immigration, and misleading about the nature of the threats posed by a group of would-be refugees.\n\nIt\u2019s a play to fears as the campaign winds down.\n\nScott Olson/Getty Images\n\nAnd it creates quite a split-screen with Democrats. Former President Barack Obama campaigns Friday in Florida and Georgia \u2013 the latter being the state where Oprah Winfrey was the star on Thursday, with her plea for voters to support a \u201cchange-maker.\u201d\n\nThe other half of the Obama rallying cry \u2013 hope \u2013 is what Democrats are looking to channel in these final days. The dynamics seem set, but no one is quite sure of what will happen in part because the two parties have placed such wildly different bets on the country.\n\nTrump is getting the campaign close he is orchestrating. It\u2019s worked before, but the stage is not his alone from here.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks\n\nThe president Thursday seemed to be in an alternate universe, one in which his administration did not separate families at the border and where his party has not been the one in power for the last two years.\n\nListening to the president blame Democrats for everything not fixed in the country felt a little desperate, since the GOP has, in fact, held control across Washington.\n\nSaul Loedb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt was congressional Republicans, after all, who could not get enough votes from among their own members to pass immigration reform, and then it was the president who decided he would not back a compromise bill. And it was Republicans, too, who tried to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and failed.\n\nOpen enrollment for those health insurance marketplaces created under the so-called Obamacare law started again Thursday for 2019. During last year\u2019s enrollment period, nearly 12 million Americans bought insurance on the exchanges, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nThose headlines of failed bills and legislative drama last year might sound like part of a distant past, but it is telling that the president is campaigning on what did not get done in Washington, instead of what did.\n\nThe TIP with John Verhovek\n\nIn any election cycle, there are guaranteed instances where Democrats and Republicans will gripe about the same thing: third-party candidates spoiling their chances at victory.\n\nBut there will be no such griping about two critical races that could decide the balance of power in the U.S. Senate.\n\nMatt York/AP Photo\n\nTwo third-party candidates, Libertarian Rick Breckenridge in Montana, and Green Party candidate Angela Green in Arizona, have dropped out and endorsed the Republican and Democratic candidates vying for Senate seats: Matt Rosendale and Kyrsten Sinema, respectively.\n\nThe development is welcome news for both challengers, who are competing in races within the margin of error according to recent polling, with just four days to go until Election Day.\n\nBut one place where a third-party candidate could still have an impact is Indiana, where a recent NBC News/Marist poll shows Libertarian candidate Lucy Benton polling at 7 percent in a race that has Democratic incumbent Sen.

Bob Corker both agree that tariffs are not great for Tennessee businesses.\n\nRepublican candidate Marsha Blackburn initially said \"tariffs are intended to punish bad actors,\" but has changed her tune saying she is \"not a fan of tariffs, and I feel like tariffs are a burden and they put up barriers. I am somebody who says, let's go for freedom, free markets and free people.\"\n\nDemocratic nominee Phil Bredesen has called the tariffs \"a tax on Tennessee\" and said, \"The effect of these tariffs is just like a new tax on Tennesseans. They will drive up prices, hurt our economy and will cost jobs, especially in our important automotive sector. The retaliatory tariffs that are promised to follow will hurt our exports, damaging farmers and even hitting iconic Tennessee businesses like Jack Daniels.\"\n\nIn June, Brown-Forman, the company behind Tennessee\u2019s whiskey brand Jack Daniels, cautioned that the war on tariffs would make it more difficult to predict future earnings.\n\n\u201cThe global economy has improved modestly over the last year, including improving conditions in many emerging markets,\u201d the company wrote in their 2018 fiscal results, which were released in June.\n\nScott Olson/Getty Images\n\n\"However, the competitive landscape in the developed world remains intense, not to mention concerns over potential retaliatory tariffs on American spirits. \"These factors make it difficult to accurately predict future results.\"\n\nThe company declined to comment on the matter to ABC News for this report.\n\nNearly six months after countries enacted the tariffs, Tennessee businesses say they have been impacted.\n\nOle Smoky Moonshine is a company based in eastern Tennessee which distills whiskey and moonshine.\n\nHall told ABC News that the effect from the tariffs for his company was \"immediate\" because the tariffs \"increased the cost of metal...which for us translates the cost for our lids because we use a lot of metal in the lids of our product.\"\n\nEven though the metal for Ole Smoky's lids originates in the United States, Hall said \"there was a price increase in the middle of the year that related to the tariffs the U.S. imposed\" because of a higher demand for U.S. made metal.\n\nHall called the lids \"a significant cost increase.\"\n\nAdam Lau/Knoxville News Sentinel via AP, FILE\n\nHall said that after the price of the metal increased, the company decided against passing the cost onto their customers and opted to leave the price of their product the same.\n\n\"We chose not to do that and reduce our [profit] margins as a result,\" Hall said.\n\nOle Smoky's is the top-selling moonshine in the world, Hall said, and in some countries, moonshine is included in the retaliatory tariffs imposed by foreign nations.\n\nDue to those tariffs, consumers in foreign nations may end up paying a higher price for their bottle of Ole Smoky Moonshine or Ole Smoky Whiskey.\n\nAnd while he's been able to keep his prices steady for his domestic customers, he worries he may have to one-day increase prices to compensate for their financial losses. They hope to balance those losses by also opening a fourth distillery in Nashville in early 2019.\n\n\"We take problems as challenges that we overcome and the tariffs are a challenge,\" Hall said. \"But we will overcome them by doing other things.\"", "In a final sprint to the finish line, former President Barack Obama delivered a fiery rebuke of the Trump administration, bringing the fight to South Florida to energize an already animated democratic base and present a different vision for the country.\n\nDemocratic candidates are on the ballot in two of the most consequential races this cycle in purple Florida -- a state pivotal to his party's hopes of securing control of the Senate and making inroads at the state level, after President Donald Trump carried the state by a slim margin in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn recent weeks, the former president has ramped up his campaign presence, stumping for a slate of candidates across the country, and Friday, he joined rising Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, Senate incumbent Bill Nelson and several statewide candidates on the trail in Miami.\n\nMiami-Dade County, a Democratic stronghold, preferred Hillary Clinton in 2016 over Donald Trump by more than 30 points.\n\nAl Diaz/Miami Herald/Getty Images\n\nIn a stark contrast to his successor, the former president's message to voters has been one of hope as the party seeks to win back control of Congress.\n\n\u201c \u201d When words stop meaning something, when truth doesn't matter, when people can just lie with abandon, democracy can't work.\n\nWithout calling out the current president by name, Obama admonished the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on asylum seekers, particularly for Trump's rhetoric on the caravan of migrants heading for the U.S. border.\n\n\"Now in 2018 they're telling you the existential threat to America is a bunch of poor refugees a thousand miles away,\" Obama said at a Miami rally for Gillum and Nelson.\n\nChris OMeara/AP\n\n\"They're even taking our brave troops away from their families for a political stunt at the border. And the men and women of our military deserve better than that. So there's just constant fear mongering to distract from the record.\"\n\n\"I know there are conservatives who are compassionate and must think there's nothing compassionate about ripping immigrant children from the arms of their mothers at the border,\" Obama said.\n\nThe former president also criticized his successor for undermining the democratic process after Trump announced a plan to end birthright citizenship for children born to non-citizens.\n\n\"I'm assuming that they recognize that a president doesn't get to decide on who's an American citizen and who's not. That's not how the Constitution of the United States works. That's not how the Bill of Rights works. That's not how our democracy works.\"\n\nJust four days before Americans head to the polls, and with many concerned over health care, Obama went after Republicans who he said have spent zero time campaigning on the GOP tax cuts that they passed earlier this year, instead telling voters they will protect pre-existing conditions, despite their countless efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"I do have to make this point because right now, Republicans are all, look, the economy is so good. Where do you think that started,\" he posed. \"When did that start?\"\n\n\"If Republicans thought their tax cut for billionaires was popular, they would be campaigning on it. You don't hear a peep out of them,\" he said. \"This was their main act in Congress. They have not mentioned it in a single ad.\"\n\n\"In fact, right at election time, suddenly Republicans are saying they're going protect your pre-existing conditions when they literally have been doing the opposite,\" Obama asserted. \"That's some kind of chutzpah.\"\n\n\"Florida, we can't let Rick Scott become the deciding vote for your pre-existing conditions protections,\" he added.\n\nAt the onset of his remarks, one heckler began shouting at the former president, but was quickly overwhelmed by attendees who began chanting \"Obama.\"\n\n\"This is what I look forward to is having a few hecklers to get me back in the mood,\" Obama jokingly said in response to the shouting. \"I enjoy that.\"\n\nObama sought to portray a different America to the Miami crowd, telling the audience that Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections \"might be the most important election of our lifetime.\"\n\n\"America's at a crossroads,\" he said. \"The health care of millions is on the ballot. Making sure working families get a fair shake is on the ballot. But maybe most of all the character of our country is on the ballot.\"\n\nThat vision is one that, he argues, Democrats must \"stand up for with clarity and patriotism and purpose.\"\n\n\"The values that bind us to your fellow citizens, no matter who we are, no matter what we look like, that's what Americans do,\" he said. \"That's what America is. That's what Andrew Gillum believes. That's what Bill Nelson believes. That's what you believe. A better vision of America.\"\n\n\"That's where I'm hopeful, Florida. I'm hopeful that we will cut through the lies, block out the noise, and remember who we are and who we are called to be.\"\n\nUnderscoring the stakes of the election, Obama called out the lies spilling from, as he said, \"the highest levels of government.\"\n\n\"When words stop meaning something, when truth doesn't matter, when people can just lie with abandon, democracy can't work.\"\n\n\"And that's what's happening at the highest levels,\" he continued. \"The only check on that behavior is you. The only check on that behavior is you and your vote. And on Tuesday you can vote for a politics that's decent.\"\n\nObama has been on the trail casting this election as more important than any other contest in recent history, including in years that featured his own name on the ballot, sending a clear message to Democrats: get out the vote. He did that again on Friday.\n\nIn a year with unprecedented turnout and enthusiasm in a midterm election, Democrats are hoping to capitalize on key opportunities in the South.\n\n\"You get some souls to the polls,\" he urged. \"Let's make history happen right here in Florida. Let's get to work. Let's go vote.\"\n\nGillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, is running in one of this year's most closely watched races against former GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis, a Trump-endorsed and occasionally controversial opponent. He would be the first African-American governor of Florida if elected in November.\n\nGillum, who scored Obama's endorsement last month and who was joined by former Vice President Joe Biden last week, is part of a progressive class of candidates who are dominating the Democratic ticket this cycle.\n\nMore aligned with Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and liberal insurgent Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Tallahassee mayor surged onto the scene in the final weeks leading into his primary victory.\n\nLynne Sladky/AP, FILE\n\nFlorida voters delivered a major upset in August after sending Gillum onto the general ballot over establishment candidate Gwen Graham, a member of a Florida political dynasty. Her father, Bob Graham, was once the state's governor and a U.S. senator.\n\nGillum captured 75 percent of the youth vote in the primary, according to NextGen America, although that coalition of voters historically doesn't participate in midterm elections.\n\nThe contentious governor's race has cast a spotlight on a range of cultural issues, including gun control and race. Gillum and DeSantis are vying for the governor's mansion in the wake of the shooting in Parkland -- where 17 students and teachers were gunned down -- that incited a national movement among young people, led by survivors from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nThis tight battle between Gillum and DeSantis has at-times become heated, particularly over race. The day after Gillum won the party's nomination in the August primary, DeSantis came under fire for telling voters during a Fox News interview that they should not \"monkey this up\" by voting for Gillum.\n\nThis week, Trump entered into the fray to defend his staunch ally by relentlessly criticizing the Democratic hopeful over Twitter and at a Wednesday rally for DeSantis in Fort Myers.\n\nBranding Gillum as a \"stone-cold thief\" and a \"radical socialist,\" Trump has ignited tensions in the contest's final days.\n\nJohn Raoux/AP\n\nGillum responded to Trump's remarks on Thursday, telling CNN: \"The President again is attempting to use scare tactics, fear mongering -- this is a race to the bottom, the kind of politics they are used to. I just happen to believe they are sorely underestimating the people of my state.\"\n\nFor his part, Gillum faced controversy earlier this year over an FBI probe into government corruption in Tallahassee and accepting a ticket to the Broadway musical \"Hamilton\" from an undercover FBI agent. Gillum said during a gubernatorial debate that he's not the direct subject of the investigation.\n\nDespite that, ABC News partner FiveThirtyEight forecasts Gillum with a three in four chance of winning. Recent polls showed a razor-thin advantage for Gillum, who holds a 49 to 48 percent lead over DeSantis among likely voters, in a CNN poll from Oct. 21. The race is rated as a toss-up.\n\nNelson, locked in a tight race with Republican Florida Gov. Rick Scott, must hang onto his seat to keep the Democrats' path to a Senate majority alive. The three-term incumbent is among 10 Democratic senators defending seats this cycle in a state Trump won two years ago. Nelson has a 49 to 47 percent lead over Scott among likely voters, according to the CNN poll.\n\nABC News' Lissette Rodriguez contributed reporting.", "Stocks are closing sharply lower on Wall Street, pulled down by more steep losses in big technology companies.

Campaign finance experts said that by limiting it to his social media feed, Trump has found a gap in campaign finance laws that are intended to let voters know who sponsors the messages they see.\n\n\"There is some ambiguity about when a disclaimer is required for ads posted exclusively on social media, and the Trump campaign may be trying to assert a loophole,\" Brendan Fischer, who is in charge of the government reforms program at nonprofit Campaign Legal Center, told ABC News.\n\nRich Pedroncelli/AP\n\nAn official with the Republican National Committee told ABC News that the video was produced for the Trump campaign. The Trump campaign did not respond to ABC News' request for comment on the video.\n\nThe 53-second video released Wednesday evening remains pinned to the top of the president's popular Twitter feed. It features Luis Bracamotes, who was sentenced to death in April after being convicted of killing two California sheriff\u2019s deputies in 2014. With a menacing smile, Bracamotes said he's going to \"kill more cops soon.\" And the video claimed \"Democrats let him into our country\" and \"Democrats let him say.\"\n\nThe video, accompanied by Trump\u2019s own message, \"Vote Republican now!\" immediately sparked controversy -- critics have called it racially charged and aimed at stoking fear at a time when Trump is pushing hard-line anti-immigration policies in response to a mostly peaceful migrant caravan traveling through Mexico.\n\nUnder current law, campaign ads are generally required to include disclaimers that clearly state who paid for the ads. Those rules are partly in place to address concerns that politicians could try and distance themselves from harsh attack ads, so as not to muddy themselves in the process.\n\nAds from PACs with vague names that don't make their allegiance clear have long made it difficult for the public to figure out where the ads are coming from.

In addition to a challenge from her right by McDaniel, Hyde-Smith is facing a challenge from her left by Democrat and former Clinton cabinet secretary Mike Espy and Democrat and former Navy intelligence officer Tobey Bartee.\n\nIf none of the candidates receive a majority of the vote on Nov. 6, the top two finishers, regardless of party, will advance to a runoff on Nov. 27.\n\nMuch like a primary, this special election is pitting one establishment Republican against a conservative insurgent, and both are staking their campaigns on their loyalty to Trump to win over his base.\n\nThe Trump factor\n\nAs Trump continues his campaign blitz, he has sharpened his party\u2019s final message for voters heading into Election Day \u2014 making his pitch a referendum on his administration\u2019s central issues, including the caravan of migrants marching towards the United States and Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s contentious confirmation process.\n\n\"This will be an election of Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order, and common sense,\" he declared at a rally in Missoula, Montana in October, and repeated that line at subsequent rallies in Houston, Texas, and Murphysboro, Ill.\n\nThis mantra has become a rallying cry as he crisscrosses the country to shore up support for Republican candidates and maintain the GOP\u2019s majority in Congress in the final days of the midterm elections.\n\nTrump stopped in Mississippi in early October to bolster Hyde-Smith's candidacy, since the special election could potentially decide the balance of power in the Senate. Hyde-Smith currently stands as the frontrunner in the race, according to a recent NBC News/Marist poll, although she still remains shy of clearing the 50 percent threshold needed to win outright on Tuesday.\n\nOn the trail, Hyde-Smith is stitching the president\u2019s remarks into her own, showing her fealty to Trump with voters.\n\n\"We\u2019ve got a president that is a leader,\" she told the small crowd in Nesbit, Miss. \"He is a leader.

Her resume showcases a long political career in Mississippi politics, previously serving as the state's Agriculture Commissioner from 2011 until her appointment to the Senate, as well as formerly serving as a state senator for 12 years beginning in 1999, when she was elected as a Democrat.\n\nThe former Agriculture Commissioner switched to the Republican Party in 2010, but in 2008, she voted in the state\u2019s Democratic primary for president. Hyde-Smith's former party affiliation has been her greatest hurdle in the race, as McDaniel continues to weaponize her Democratic ties.\n\nDespite not revealing who she voted for in 2008, McDaniel repeatedly claimed that the former Democrat voted for Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"I understand that as a lifelong Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton, it might be difficult for Cindy Hyde-Smith to advocate vocally for one of President Trump's Supreme Court nominees, but Mississippians are counting on her to stand and fight for them in the U.S. Senate,\" he said in a statement provided to ABC News last month.\n\nAfter nearly defeating Cochran in 2014 in a primary challenge, McDaniel decided to run again this cycle. Boasting name recognition across the state and riding anti-establishment fervor, he first mounted a bid in the Senate race against incumbent GOP Sen. Roger Wicker.\n\nAfter Cochran resigned, McDaniel jumped into the special election race in March, encouraged by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, to contest the establishment\u2019s hold on the seat.\n\nThe former conservative talk show host, seeking to fuel his outsider candidacy with support from Trump's base, has relentlessly challenged Hyde-Smith every step of the way on her loyalty to the president. Despite failing to secure Trump's endorsement, which was clinched by Hyde-Smith, McDaniel has taken some unconventional steps to garner approval from the White House, including inviting supporters to show up to the Trump rally for Hyde-Smith.\n\n\"Show the President that Trump Country is McDaniel Country,\" an email to supporters read.\n\nHe has also consistently claimed that Trump was \"forced\" into endorsing Hyde-Smith by the Washington establishment, primarily Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nMcDaniel, in a statement from October, opined that as the only \"lifelong\" Republican in the race, on Election Day, \"Mississippians will ultimately do the right thing.\"\n\nOver the weekend, at a Hyde-Smith campaign event in Nesbit, a truck clad in McDaniel campaign signs that read \"Remember Mississippi,\" parked as close as possible to the venue, seemingly trolling the incumbent senator.\n\nKendall Karson/ABC News\n\nBut marring McDaniel's chances is a campaign fraught with controversy of his own making.\n\nDuring an interview on MSNBC, when asked how he would speak to the state\u2019s African-American population, which is one of the largest in the country, the state senator responded, \"After 100 years of begging for federal government scraps, where are you today?\"\n\nOut-Trumping the opposition\n\nTheir bitter rivalry came to a head as the Kavanaugh hearings rattled Washington.\n\nIn an apparent show of loyalty to Trump, McDaniel told American Family Radio in September of Kavanaugh accuser, Christine Blasey Ford's claims, \"These allegations, 99 percent of the time, are just absolutely fabricated.\"\n\nHe also urged Hyde-Smith to fight \"tooth and nail\" to confirm the judge, cornering her into issuing a full-throated embrace of Kavanaugh.\n\nRecalling the Kavanaugh hearings, after accepting a \"women for Kavanaugh\" t-shirt during the weekend campaign stop, she told the crowd of the hearings, \"When we say it was brutal, that is an understatement.\"\n\n\"It was unbelievable, but I want you to know that we did the right thing by Brett Kavanaugh,\" she asserted.\n\nHyde-Smith is adamantly positioning herself as the ultimate champion of the Trump agenda, and in an interview with ABC News in Nesbit, she brushed off any concerns about her former Democratic party affiliation.\n\n\"I'll tell you, anybody in Mississippi that is over 40 years old, they voted for a Democrat because we were a Democratic state many years ago,\" she said. \"[I] have a very conservative voting record that I\u2019m very proud of, so really that is a non-issue.\"\n\nPushing an ardent defense of the president\u2019s policies, Hyde-Smith added, \"I know firsthand that we have got to secure those borders.\"\n\n\"It is a must, we cannot allow this to go on any longer,\" she continued.\n\nBrandon Dill/EPA via Shutterstock\n\nWhen pressed on Trump's often heated rhetoric on immigration, she evaded the question, instead telling ABC News, \"I cannot speak for the president, I can only speak for myself.\"\n\nStanding before her campaign tour bus, which features a blown-up selfie of the senator and the president plastered on the side, she praised Trump for bringing prosperity to Mississippi, pointing to the tax cuts the GOP passed this year as a signature achievement of the Trump administration and for the Magnolia state.\n\n\"The tax cuts have been huge for our state,\" she said. \"The environment that he has created to allow us to prosper, that is what Mississippi needs.\"\n\nOf all 50 states, Mississippi ranks either the lowest or among the lowest in terms of percentage of the population in poverty (19.7 percent as of 2017), education attainment (only 21 percent of the state has a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher), and median household income ($40,528), according to the most recent information from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe weight of a Trump endorsement\n\nIn the deep red state, which voted for Trump by nearly 20 points in 2016, the president continues to have a favorable rating, with more than half the state approving of the president's job performance, according to the NBC News/Marist poll.\n\nKendall Karson/ABC News\n\nHyde-Smith is seizing on Trump's firm standing in the state to win over his voting bloc. Among attendees at her campaign events, some indicated that they see her as a reflection of the president and as the only candidate in the crowded field who will advance his progress.\n\n\"In 2016, I voted for Trump,\" Janet Curtis from Nesbit told ABC News. \"I am supporting Cindy Hyde-Smith and I still support Trump.\"\n\nWhen asked why he\u2019s voting, Brandon Grace from Senatobia, said, \"To make America great again. To keep the things that are going.\"\n\n\"Like Cindy was saying,\" he added.\n\nIn the Republican stronghold of Gulfport \u2014 which sits on Mississippi's Gulf Coast and where an overwhelming majority voted for Trump in the 2016 presidential election, according to the New York Times \u2014 when it comes to deciding between the conservative they know in McDaniel and the Trump-approved candidate in Hyde-Smith on Nov. 6, voters are weighing Trump\u2019s endorsement heavily.\n\nKendall Karson/ABC News\n\n\"I think that whole campaign, putting [Trump] up there on the podium supporting Cindy, that\u2019s what we all see,\" Elizabeth West, 42, told ABC News in local restaurant Petie's Eats Downtown. \"That goes a long way with the public. You can see the ripple effect.\"\n\nAnother voter, Mary Cox, 50, who also lives in Gulfport and as a staunch pro-life supporter, ranked abortion as her top issue at the polls, said that a candidate's voting record signals their loyalty to Trump.\n\n\"If they are loyal, they are going to follow suit,\" she asserted. \"They are going to vote the way that the president wants them to vote.\"\n\nHyde-Smith has a 100 percent Trump score, according to FiveThirtyEight.\n\nCox conceded that initially, she supported McDaniel, but after Trump interjected himself in the race, her opinion shifted in favor of Hyde-Smith.\n\n\"I was going for Chris McDaniel, then Trump backed her,\" she added. \"I would like to take and vote for all of the ones Trump endorses. McDaniel has a very good background. Cindy-Hyde-Smith just kinda popped up out of nowhere.\"\n\nKendall Karson/ABC News\n\n\"I don\u2019t like the fact that Cindy Hyde-Smith used to be a Democrat but Trump is endorsing her,\" she continued.\n\nWhen asked if the election were held today who would she vote for, Cox said, \"For Cindy Hyde-Smith just because Trump endorsed her.\"\n\nA historic bid in a historic year\n\nAlready distinguished as the first woman to represent Mississippi in Congress, Hyde-Smith would also be the first woman elected to the Senate from the Magnolia State if she wins next week, or three weeks later in the likely runoff.\n\nIn a year in which a historic number of woman are running for elected office, and winning, Hyde-Smith\u2019s bid to the U.S. Senate is historic. She is among 23 female Senate candidates in a general election match-up this cycle.\n\nWhile her victory would secure a greater presence for women in the Senate, she is focused on keeping the GOP\u2019s majority in this year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\n\"We need to keep on going,\" Hyde-Smith said. \"We have so many issues facing us right now. Tuesday is an important day. It\u2019s the jungle race, it is named correctly.

Joe Manchin squared off Thursday against Republican Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in West Virginia\u2019s first -- and only -- Senate debate. But it was a third name that never left the room: President Donald Trump.\n\nAhead of Trump\u2019s third Make America Great Again rally in West Virginia on Friday, Morrisey came out on the attack and tried to demonstrate how he plans to be in Trump\u2019s corner. Manchin, who has a reputation for working as a moderate independent in a highly partisan Congress, said he wants to work across the aisle and even with the president.\n\n\u201cOur president -- whether you voted for him or not he\u2019s the president of the United States -- I want him to succeed and do well. And I\u2019ll stand up and support him when it\u2019s good for West Virginia -- and when it\u2019s not, I stand up to him,\u201d Manchin said.\n\nAP\n\nMorrisey -- using tactics straight from the president\u2019s playbook -- repeatedly brought up \u201c[Chuck] Schumer, [Nancy] Pelosi, Hillary Clinton, Washington liberals\u201d and tried to tie Manchin to Clinton.\n\n\u201cHe said he was open to Donald Trump, but when the key judgment came in 2016, he said no to Donald Trump,\u201d Morrisey said. \u201cHe made his bed with Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s not on the ballot,\u201d Manchin shot back. \u201cManchin and Pat Morrisey are. Pat, I\u2019m right here.\u201d\n\nWest Virginia supported Trump over Clinton by an overwhelming 42 points in the 2016 presidential election, and as president, Trump has continued to hold high approval ratings in the state. But despite Trump\u2019s landslide victory in the Mountain State, the Senate race has remained highly competitive.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s debate, the two candidates sparred over the hot button issues of abortion rights, immigration and health care.\n\nBut the first question posed by moderator Hoppy Kercheval, a West Virginia political radio host, focused on Trump\u2019s rhetoric in the aftermath of a mass shooting that targeted a synagogue in nearby Pittsburgh.\n\nManchin said the president\u2019s tone \u201cneeds to be tamped down.\u201d\n\nAP\n\n\u201cI hope that he can tone down the rhetoric, I hope that he can tone down the tweets,\u201d Manchin said. He called the current political climate \u201ctribal.\u201d\n\nMorrisey denounced anti-Semitism but then called any finger-pointing toward the president\u2019s rhetoric \u201ccrass.\u201d\n\nSitting side by side, the debate was at times testy as the two candidates debated about their personal connections to the pharmaceutical industry, which is seen as an enemy in a state that has been ravaged by the opioid crisis. West Virginia has the highest rate of opioid overdose deaths in the nation in 2016, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nManchin accused Morrisey of profiting off of the pharmaceutical industry: \u201cThis is the only man who has profited from pills coming to West Virginia,\u201d Manchin said.\n\nMorrisey accused Manchin of not being an effective leader on the issue and touted his work as attorney general on the issue.\n\n\u201cWe have taken on the problem, we have gone after root causes of the epidemic and we have won record-breaking settlements,\u201d Morrisey said.\n\nMichael Mathes/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nManchin has made health care the cornerstone of his campaign, and slammed Morrisey for his role in a federal lawsuit, filed along with other states, that would overturn the Affordable Care Act and eliminate protections for people with pre-exisiting conditions.\n\nMorrisey said he wants to protect people with pre-exisitng conditions, but Manchin reminded him of wanting to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cHe professes repeal, repeal, repeal, and he gladly files a lawsuit that would take 800,000 people out of coverage,\u201d Manchin said.\n\nWhile the southern border is hundreds of miles away, both Morrisey and Manchin weighed in on the immigration debate and said they support tightening up the borders. Neither, however, would say if they support Trump\u2019s call to end birthright citizenship.\n\n\u201cI think the president is right to not only send the troops but clamp down on the border,\u201d Morrisey said. \u201cI think we need to reform our immigration system, we need to end this chain migration and have merit-based immigration, no amnesty.\u201d\n\nManchin also said he would be tough on immigration: \u201cI\u2019m against sanctuary cities, I\u2019ve clamped down, I don\u2019t think illegals should be able to come here and set up shop.\u201d\n\nOn birthright citizenship, Manchin said it\u2019s \u201cworthy of looking at,\u201d but said the president could not enact it by executive order.\n\nThe candidates were also asked for their positions on Amendment 1, an initiative that would end abortions and abortion funding in the state. Manchin said he would not be supporting the initiative, although he is anti-abortion, because it does not have exceptions for incest, rape or the life of the mother. Morrisey said he opposes any taxpayer funding for abortion, and accused Manchin of being on \u201cboth sides\u201d of the abortion debate.\n\nAP\n\nThe Supreme Court has long been a leading issue in the social conservative leaning state. Manchin was the lone Democratic senator who voted in favor of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. He defended himself against criticism on the timing of his vote -- as he's received criticism for appearing to wait until after Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, cast the deciding ballot to announce his decision.\n\n\u201cI was the first to ask for an FBI investigation, I went through every word of that investigation,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cThe vote is the vote; nothing was going to change.\u201d\n\nMorrisey pounced on his answer: \u201cHe went to powder in the bathroom and left and allowed Maine to decide West Virginia\u2019s vote.\u201d\n\nAfter the debate, when asked by ABC News about how that vote has been received in the state, Manchin said he thinks people understand he did his job.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a political decision. I\u2019m the only Democrat who stood for it and had done it,\u201d Manchin said.\n\nThe race, while close, is currently leaning in Manchin's favor. Before the debate began, a spokesperson for a major Republican political PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund, confirmed to ABC News that after spending millions on the race it has stopped airing commercials for Morrisey and is instead sending $150,000 for get out the vote efforts.\n\nTrump will hold a rally for Morrisey on Friday in Huntington, West Virginia. At least one Trump tuned into the debate -- the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., tweeted he watched.\n\nWatching the #WVSEN debate and a few things are clear: 1. @MorriseyWV will support my father\u2019s America First agenda 100%. 2. @JoeManchinWV can\u2019t be trusted to support my father\u2019s agenda & has a lot more in common with Hillary Clinton than the people of WV! #wv #westvirginia pic.twitter.com/s7rbv5tZMs \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) November 1, 2018\n\nThroughout the camapign, Manchin has hit Morrisey on his time working in Washington and his New Jersey ties.\n\n\u201cI don't think Patrick's lying. I don't think he's dishonest. I think he's confused and he doesn't understand West Virginia because he hasn't been here that long,\u201d Manchin said.\n\nIn his closing, Morrisey accused Manchin, not him, of having \u201cNew Jersey values.\u201d", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "Forward Anthony Davis did not play in the New Orleans Pelicans' game at Portland on Thursday night.\n\nDavis missed two games with a sprained right elbow before returning Wednesday to play 41 minutes in a 131-121 loss to the Warriors.\n\nThe injury didn't seem to affect Davis much as he had 17 points, 12 rebounds and 7 assists against the reigning champs.\n\nIn addition to Davis, point guard Elfrid Payton will miss his third straight game with a right ankle sprain.\n\nForward Julius Randle is considered probable to play as he deals with plantar fasciitis in his left foot.", "Stocks are closing sharply lower on Wall Street, pulled down by more steep losses in big technology companies.

He was joined by his teammate Eric Reid, along with others in the league.\n\nTwitter/GatorLenny\n\nThe 30-year-old's controversial demonstration attracted both backlash and praise by spectators, including President Donald Trump, who called for the firing of NFL players who knelt in protest during the anthem.\n\nKaepernick was ultimately marked as the face of the national movement. In 2017, he opted out of his contract, making him a free agent. Kaepernick currently remains unsigned for the 2018 season.\n\nIn May, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell introduced a policy that required players to stand during the national anthem, but would allow them to have the option of remaining in the locker room during the pregame performance if they choose to do so. The policy would ultimately fine teams for players who chose to sit or kneel during the anthem. The NFL, however, put the policy on hold for the 2018 season to allow for further discussion between the union and the league about the issue, according to ESPN.\n\nKaepernick's demonstrations continue to draw support from a number of athletes and other personnel in the NFL.\n\nGetty Images, FILE\n\nEarlier this season, Miami Dolphins wide receivers Kenny Stills and Albert Wilson knelt and defensive end Robert Quinn raised a clenched fist while \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" played before their game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Reporter: In these final days of the campaign, president trump is using the trappings and power of the presidency to make illegal immigration a central issue. Tonight, bashing Democrats from the white house. You can come up with the greatest border plan, the greatest immigration plan, you won't get one vote from a Democrat. Reporter: He's promising a new executive order to make it harder to seek asylum. And talking about how he's sending U.S. Troops to the border to stop a caravan of migrants. They will do the job. They are setting up right now and they're preparing. Reporter: He has promised up to 15,000 military personnel, that's roughly the same number of U.S. Troops fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. But the troops at the border can only offer logistical support for the border patrol. Backstage at his rally in Florida, I asked him about that. The active duty military, you know the law, you're the president. They can't arrest people crossing the border. They can't -- Well, it depends. Reporter: They're not allowed to do -- They can't invade our country. You look at that, it almost looks like -- Reporter: Caravans are an invasion in these are some of the poorest people in the world. These are some rough people. Reporter: In fact, there is no invasion. The caravan of migrants fleeing poverty and violence is, tonight, some 900 miles from the U.S. Border. They are coming to ask for asylum, not to invade. It's one of many exaggerations and falsehoods from the president in the final days of the campaign. As a candidate, trump once promised never to tell a lie. I will never lie to you. Reporter: Can you tell me now, honestly, have you kept to that promise at all times? Well, I try, I mean, I do try. I think you try, too. You say things about me that are not necessarily correct. I do try. And I always want to tell the truth. When I can, I tell the truth. Sometimes it turns out to be, where something happens, there's a change. But I always like to be truthful. Jonathan Karl joins us now in studio. You had a chance to ask the president about the midterms and he gave you his take and it's what's aligning with what you're seeing in his schedule? Reporter: He's only going to states he won and he's campaigning for governor candidates and for senate candidates. You get the sense, talking to the president and talking to those around him, that he is all but resigned to losing the house and hoping they will control the senate. A major development tonight.

Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nTrump took his final week midterm blitz to the heartland tonight, appearing in a hangar of the Columbia airport to stump for the state's Attorney General Josh Hawley in his race against Sen.

McCaskill, labeling her as a phony for her recent messaging in which she has sought to frame herself as a moderate on issues like immigration.\n\n\"She\u2019s been saying such nice things about me but you know what, she\u2019ll never vote with me,\" Trump said.\n\nAfter inviting Hawley onstage, the president attacked McCaskill again before assuring the crowd that Republicans would always guarantee the protection of coverage for pre-existing conditions, an issue McCaskill has repeatedly sought to highlight in her fight against Hawley, one of the plaintiffs in the Republican attorney general's lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn highlighting his work on North Korea, Trump announced that he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier in the day about trade, and previewed \"lots of great things\" on that front \"over the next short period of time.\"\n\nTrump returns to Missouri next Monday with a rally in Cape Girardeau.", "President Donald Trump mangled the facts Thursday when addressing immigration and falsely claiming - more than once - that former President Barack Obama was responsible for family separations at the border.\n\nInterested in Donald Trump? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nHere's a look at what Trump said and what happened:\n\nIt's Obama's fault? Not true\n\nTrump was widely criticized this spring for his rollout of a \"zero-tolerance\" policy on immigration that resulted in the chaotic separations of some 2,600 children from their families. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, there are still some 221 children in custody as a result of the policy, after a federal judge ordered that the families be reunited.\n\nTrump eventually signed an executive order backtracking on the policy, but he still seems frustrated that he was blamed for the chaos at the border. Initially, Trump blamed Democrats in Congress, although they don't have majority control to push through new immigration laws. And on Thursday, Trump blamed Obama, who never enforced a zero-tolerance policy that has led to the recent mass separation of families.\n\n\"Nobody talks about that, but under President Obama, they separated children from the parents,\" Trump said.\n\nRebecca Blackwell/AP\n\nTrump later returned to this theme, even after being asked an unrelated question about tents.\n\n\"President Obama separated children from families, and all I did was take the same law, and then I softened the law, but by softening the law, many people come up that would not have come up if there was separation,\" he said.\n\nWhat is true is that Obama had faced an influx of children both traveling alone and with families as a result of violence in Central America. And at one point, the Obama administration tried housing the families in special detention centers. But after a federal judge in California ruled that the arrangement violated a long-standing agreement barring kids from jail-like settings for extended periods, even with their parents, the government began releasing families into the U.S. pending notification of their next court date.\n\nSome arriving families were separated during the Obama and Bush administrations but most of those cases would have been tied to other serious crimes like drug trafficking. Trump\u2019s policy was different because his administration considered the act of crossing the border illegally enough of a justification to detain the adult and put the child in protective custody.\n\nTrump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have derided the Obama-era policy as \"catch and release\" because there were numerous cases where the migrant wouldn't appear in court. They have previously said releasing families into the U.S. increased levels of illegal immigration in the U.S., which led to the zero-tolerance policy in the first place. That catch-and-release policy actually pre-dated Obama.", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "Just 50 minutes before a flight from London to Japan was scheduled to depart, the pilot was arrested for having almost 10 times the legal amount of alcohol allowed in his system.\n\nFirst officer Katsutoshi Jitsukawa, 42, was supposed to pilot a Sunday evening flight to Tokyo on a Boeing 777 aircraft, which holds up to 244 passengers.\n\nA driver of a crew bus alerted police after smelling alcohol on Jitsukawa\u2019s breath, Japanese broadcaster NHK reported.\n\nAmer Ghazzal/Barcroft Images/Barcroft Media via Getty Images\n\nJitsukawa was arrested at Heathrow Airport in London after failing an alcohol breath test.\n\nLondon\u2019s Metropolitan Police said tests revealed he had 189 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood in his system -- almost ten times the 20 mg limit for a pilot.\n\nIn England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the alcohol limit for drivers is 80 mg per 100 ml of blood.\n\nOn Thursday, Jitsukawa pleaded guilty to exceeding the alcohol limit at Uxbridge Magistrates\u2019 Court.

Abrams' opponent, Georgia's secretary of state, will have the GOP's biggest star rallying for him, the president.

So, I'm here today to support a changemaker. Reporter: Oprah Winfrey, campaigning for Democrat Stacey Abrams, who could become the nation's first black female governor. This was the moment. 2018 is our time, because we can't wait any longer. Reporter: Today, with Republican candidate Brian Kemp, vice president Mike pence. I'm kind of a big deal, too. I got a message for all Stacey Abrams' liberal Hollywood friends, this ain't Hollywood. This is Georgia. Reporter: I asked Abrams about that criticism. Are you running a state campaign or a national campaign? We're running a locally grounded campaign that is nationally known. Reporter: Kemp, too, has national backing, from president trump. As you all know, this race is a battle for the soul of our state. Reporter: But as Georgia's secretary of state, charged with supervising elections, Kemp's battling accusations that he's trying to block votes from Democrats. We have an opponent who is an architect of voter suppression. Reporter: Critics say Kemp is stalling voter registrations of 53,000 Georgia residents because applications don't exactly match their I.D.S, like a missing initial or signature that looks slightly off. Kemp declined a formal interview, but I caught up with him at one of his rallies. I asked about the accusations. What about voter suppression? Well, that's a myth. That is a myth that the Democrats bring out every two years. Reporter: With 70% of the tied up applications belonging to black voters, I asked again. So, what do you say to -- We have to go. I'm not trying to suppress. Minority participation is up 23% in Georgia. 23%. That's what you should report and not believe this bs about voter suppression. Reporter: Amidst the controversy, voter enthusiasm is sky high. And Oprah working to maintain the momentum. And for anybody here who has an ancestor who didn't have the right to vote, and you are choosing not to vote, wherever you are in this state, in this country, you are dishonoring your family. And Deborah Roberts joins us now in studio. And deb, you can never gauge how much a celebrity can effect a candidate, but there is one big reason why Oprah Winfrey went toorgia. Reporter: No question, Tom. They call it the Oprah effect. In fact, some people gauge that maybe she turned out a million extra voters for Obama by campaigning for him. Stacey Abrams needs the core supporters, women, minorities, to turn out. Oprah touches those people, and she might help. But Kemp has his own big dog coming in, the president coming to Georgia to stump for him on Sunday. Deb Roberts getting answers for us.

There were no obvious signs of trauma, police said.\n\nThe bodies are believed to have washed ashore with the tide and stayed when the tide went out, police said.\n\nFour days later, police identified the bodies as Tala Farea, 16, and Rotana Farea, 22.\n\nThe younger sister, Tala, had been reported missing on Aug. 24, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. That was the last time the two sisters were seen in Virginia, two police sources told ABC News.\n\nNew York Police Department\n\nThe Royal Consulate General of Saudi Arabia in New York confirmed in a statement Tuesday that the Farea sisters were students accompanying their brother in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe consulate said it has \"appointed an attorney to follow the case closely\" and that authorities \"are following closely and constantly for details on the case including the forensic reports showing the causes of death which have not yet been finalized and is still under investigation.\"\n\nAnyone with information about the Farea sisters is urged to call the New York City Police Department's Crime Stoppers hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS.\n\nABC News' Kaelyn Forde and Emily Shapiro contributed to this report.", "A dog named Charlie shot a man named \"Tex\" on the way to a jackrabbit hunt in the New Mexico desert.\n\n\u201cIt went through my ribs my lung and busted up my collarbone on the right side,\" victim Tex Harold Gilligan told ABC News. \"I had a gaping hole, you know, and a lot of blood there too,\u201d Gilligan said. \u201cI could see the blood and I felt it,\u201d he said.\n\nGilligan, 74, was left with three broken ribs, and injured lung, a broken collarbone and three very agitated dogs -- Charlie chief among them.\n\nCourtesy Tex Gilligan\n\nGilligan said that he had loaded up his pickup truck with his gun and his trio of dogs -- Charlie, Scooter and Cowboy -- climbed into the driver's seat, and headed out to the desert west of Las Cruces to hunt jackrabbits.\n\nCharlie 120-pound Rottweiler mix got his foot in the trigger of the gun, caught the trigger and blasted a shot at his unsuspecting owner, who said that at first he thought he'd been hit by a sniper from a distance.\n\n\u201cI thought who was that?\" Gilligan told ABC News.\n\n\"I was there, isolated, nobody was around.\"\n\nGilligan said he normally doesn't bring his cell phone along when he's hunting, but due to recent heavy rains, he decided to bring it in case he needed to call his kid if he got stuck in the rain.\n\nHe rolled out of the truck and called 911.\n\n\u201c \u201d I never thought that this would happen. It\u2019s an interesting story: a dog shot a man!\n\nLaw enforcement officers from the Do\u00f1a Ana County Sheriff's office, the New Mexico State Police and U.S. Customs and Border Protection responded to the scene and found Gilligan lying next to his truck with a gunshot wound to the chest.\n\nThe investigation to date appears to suggest that Charlie, who was riding at the front seat of his truck, slipped and got his claw caught on the trigger of the shotgun.\n\n\u201cThe gun was positioned in the truck with the barrel facing up, towards Mr. Gilligan,\u201d Do\u00f1a Ana County Sheriff's spokeswoman Kelly Jameson told ABC News.\n\n\u201cApparently Mr. Gilligan ... had placed his gun in the floorboard of the truck with the butt of the gun on the floorboard,\u201d Jameson said.\n\nGilligan first told the dispatch that he accidentally shot himself.\n\n\u201cThe investigation is being handled as an accidental shooting,\u201d Jameson told ABC News.\n\nGilligan was taken to an area hospital, where doctors determined it would be best to leave the bullet inside him, for fear of damaging his pierced lung.\n\n\u201c \u201d It went through my ribs my lung and busted up my collarbone on the right side.

The very picture of America\u2019s heartland, it's home to most of the dairy farms in the country.\n\nBut underneath the surface, historically low milk prices, coupled with a milk surplus, have Wisconsin dairy farmers teetering on the edge, threatening families with bankruptcy and forcing them to give up farms they have run for generations.\n\nSarah Lloyd, a dairy farmer from Wisconsin Dells, said the western part of the state is leading the nation in claims of agricultural bankruptcy, also known as chapter 13.\n\n\"It feels pretty hopeless right now,\" Lloyd said.\n\nAnd President Trump's trade war and tariffs this summer may have inadvertently made a bad situation worse, with dairy farmers feeling the negative repercussions of Trump's so-called \"America First\" policies.\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDairy farmers are not just an economic powerhouse in Wisconsin, contributing $43.4 billion to the state\u2019s economy annually, they are also the backbone of many rural communities, making them a political powerhouse as well.\n\nThey\u2019re a key voting bloc that helped deliver Trump the state in 2016, flipping Wisconsin from blue to red for the first time in 32 years. Wisconsin helped the president secure his electoral victory.\n\nWhich is why dairy farmers are a group of voters Republicans cannot lose in the upcoming midterms as polling shows Democrats are back on firm footing in Wisconsin.\n\nIn the past few days, politicians have been flooding the state to stump for various candidates. Last week in northwest Wisconsin, the president praised America\u2019s dairy land: \"I have to say this, because we have a lot of great farmers in this country, but I give Wisconsin a lot of credit for it.\"\n\nAt the same rally, Gov. Scott Walker praised Trump.\n\n\"He said, 'We will take care of the dairy farmers,' and unlike so many politicians in Washington in the past, this president never forgot his promise to the dairy farmers of the state of Wisconsin. He's making dairy great again in America, and it starts in Wisconsin!\" Walker said.\n\nKevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nIt\u2019s a message many in this area are desperate to hear. Wisconsin is losing one and a half dairy farms a day, and in Marathon County, 29 dairy farms have gone under in the past year.\n\n\"We need something to help the small family farms in the next couple months, otherwise we are going to see it crumble,\" dairy farmer Keith Kraeger said.\n\nHe described watching people he knows having to give up their farms as \"getting hit in the stomach.\"\n\n\"You don\u2019t want to see them leave, 'cause you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re gonna be next,\" he added. \"I heard some farmers [are] getting suicide hotline numbers in their milk checks.\"\n\nDave Sedlacek, also a farmer, explained why some might contemplate suicide.\n\n\"If I have insurance on myself, I go out and commit suicide, the family gets the money,\" Sedlacek said. \"That\u2019s why some of these guys \u2026 are killing themselves so the family gets the insurance money to keep the farms running. It all goes back to that saying, 'You\u2019re worth more dead than alive.'\"\n\nSome dairy farmers argue that the over-production of milk has created a surplus and led to plummeting prices. They say decreasing -- or managing -- the milk supply could help correct the cycle.\n\nBut in dire financial straits, the dairy industry has also been drawn into a political battle.\n\nAfter months of stalled negotiations over NAFTA, Trump has announced a new proposed trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.\n\nUnder the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), Canada will increase the amount of U.S. dairy products it imports.\n\nBut some farmers are skeptical how much it will really improve things.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have much impact,\" dairy farmer Hans Breitenmoser said. \"In my opinion, it's not going to make really a hill of beans worth a difference. I think it\u2019s a band aid on a bullet hole.\"\n\n\"This is not what we wanted towards the Canadian farmer,\" Kraeger said. \"I applaud President Trump for looking out \u2026 but this was not the approach.\"\n\n\"They have a system that is working for them,\" Kraeger continued, adding the U.S. should look at what Canada is doing well on the issue and incorporate it.\n\n\"I know President Trump he\u2019s got to do his thing \u2026 to where I was hoping it was going to help the farmers, the farmers helped him get into the office,\u201d Kraeger added. \"It\u2019s pretty disappointing right now.\u201d\n\nABC News\n\nBut as challenging as it has been recently, this is not a group that\u2019s willing to give up easily. Their love of farming goes beyond work; it\u2019s also a lifestyle for many, rooted in a history as old as this country.\n\nKraeger's wife, Julie, like many farmer\u2019s spouses, has an \"off-farm job\" that helps pay the bills and gives the family health insurance.\n\n\"If there was enough income here, I wouldn't have to do that. I would prefer to stay home and take care and tend to everything that needed to be done here,\" Julie Kraeger explained. \"But instead, this all kind of gets pushed aside \u2026 this is really where we should be.\"\n\nABC News\n\nLloyd also knows this life well. She is another farmer\u2019s wife who has an \"off-farm\" job. Her husband Nels and his parents have been farming for over 100 years. She helps to support her family farm and many others on the brink as an advocate for Wisconsin dairy farmers, working with Dairy Together, a part of the Wisconsin Dairy Farmers Union.\n\nThis summer, as the negative repercussions of the tariff battle became clear, Trump announced his own $12 billion farm bill to help alleviate the strain.\n\nBut for Lloyd, it may be too little, too late.\n\n\"For our 350-cow dairy, we think we would get about a one-time payment of $6,570,\" Lloyd said. \"But we figure we are losing about $25,000 a month, so a one-time payment of $6,570 is not going to get us very far. It's certainly not going to pull anybody out from going off the edge of the cliff.\"\n\nLike many farmers, Lloyd said she doesn\u2019t want a hand out, just a hands up. Lloyd, Keith Kraeger and a group of dairy farmers from across the country took that message to Capitol Hill in September. They met with Democratic Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin, who is up for re-election this year.\n\nAngela Major/The Janesville Gazette via AP\n\nAfter the meeting with lawmakers, Lloyd said she thinks her \"voice was heard today, and that\u2019s why I came to DC.\"\n\n\"This morning I felt nervous,\" Kraeger said. \"Really, hats off to the representatives, and senators and congressmen that \u2026 had an ear to listen to us.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s a good feeling to go back home and tell the rest of the farmers what the experience was,\" he added.\n\nBaldwin is expected to retain her seat, but with a little over a week to go until midterms, other tight Wisconsin races are heating up.\n\nLast Friday, during an impassioned gubernatorial debate between Gov. Walker and Democratic candidate Tony Evers, the topic of dairy farmers was raised.\n\nWalker said that more people needed to eat cereal and cheese.\n\nEvers echoed a position some dairy farmers have argued about over production.\n\nABC News\n\n\"We have encouraged people to produce, now we are in a situation where we have an overabundance. We have to help them diversify,\" Evers said.\n\nBack home in Lloyd\u2019s district where incumbent Republican congressman Glenn Grothman leads in the polls, she said something big will have to change to save her farm.\n\n\"We are in a real crisis situation,\" Lloyd said. \"We can't get a price that is going to cover our cost of production \u2026 with no end in sight, I don't know, we're just going to have to go further and further in debt.\"\n\nLooming over the work at hand is the very real concern that one day, all of this could be gone. Still, Lloyd said she has hope.\n\n\"I read about how the farmers' union and some of these different organizations are starting to wake up and see the light, but we can\u2019t [wait] too long. We gotta do it.

It looks like across the crunching the numbers are gonna ways surpassed the last mid term elections though we pesetas last her midterm elections were very very low voter participation but what's remarkable as were already seeing some states. Where the voting is surpassing presidential years that is just unbelievable. Democrats say that they really like what they're seeing big uptick in young voters yeah especially five cents and sort. 100% they saw eighteen between nine year olds overall 500%. Uptick from 2014 the last mid term. That's an incredible number. And that's good for Democrats you know that young people tend to. Tilt Democrat obviously we don't know.

As we are tracking here to ABC news the early voting that is underway were also following a number of voting problems growing concerns around the country. I you've heard us here report to briefing room and on the big vote the trouble in Georgia. Where there is a controversy over 53000. Registrations that have been put in limbo there but there's also. A fight that's been brewing in North Dakota of all places over a last minute change to the law they are North Dakota since the primaries. Are requiring. Voter ID's Mary Alice to have this street address earned. DID. Not simply a PO box and that impacts a heck of a lot of people and one group in particular demo. Pratt say this law was designed to specifically make it harder for native Americans to vote. A huge it American population there in North Dakota much larger than the rest of the country and a lot of them don't have street addresses it PO boxes. Just because the weighted than the federal mail delivered on reservations. And so they are really worried that this was a targeted efforts. And that it could swing the rate since last go around Heidi hi campus sitting Democrat only won by a few thousand votes so this could make all the difference. And that has spawned in incredible movement to push back against this new law we've seen. I. Mobilize native American voters to make sure they can exercise those rights. And were a very pleased to have with us two of those leaders of that movement. Musical artist Billy Ray Cyrus is joining us from Los Angeles.

Out of out of North Dakota I know you've been active with native American issues in the past but what was it about this issue that made you think. You know I've got to do something I've thought ahead to the reservations and and get some work done on the subject. Well I am very familiar with the indigenous peoples. Plight. What they've been through in past president want to look inept for the future and when I saw your story reduce. Really struck a nerve and said this isn't right. Com unfortunately eagle all's been passed but the clock is ticking. There's no sense arguing about it what we've got to do now is take action and find a solution. To get people registered to get their address to get their voting cards we got to take action and provide a solution there's no sense arguing about it it's done. And mark buffalo it sounds like.

And Billy Ray in in a number of conservative corners of the country we often see. Politicians. And their backers demonize Hollywood that they're sort of a backlash against. Celebrities such as yourself and mark participating intervening in other states have you felt that in North Dakota which traditionally has been a a pretty Republican state and in what do you say to those critics. Of your effort. Well first it's ironic I gotta be Hollywood's here over my shoulder. It will be instead what I'll solid North Dakota was. A beautiful harnessing of power. He and integrity. Brilliance there spirit begin kind of as as mark said there you could tell OK it's time that. We take action we take the ball we've. Keeping democracy allow of we all it's the one thing that every side agree on group agrees on Democrat Republican independent that everyone agrees. Democracy is somewhat under assault. Isn't it a beautiful irony that the native Americans the indigenous people would help save our democracy. That's powerful and like mark said there's young people notice that this is where we were was college. In turtle mountain. Aaron it was. Young people they were excited about democracy. And I think this is a great Tom for our country. It is our rejuvenation. Of the democracy this spirit and the will of the people that built this country. He had an engagement certainly it's uplifting that's it's it's a positive rejuvenating now force for sure. You talk about democracy. Want to play a little that you have a new single out and out this summer but it. Certainly perked up our ears it's a little bit of it it's called goddess of democracy and we loved ask you about it hitless. The raid by the great tune goddess of democracy what's the back story to this Billy right. A wrote the song with two tour Vietnam veteran dom Von tress. And another great songwriter named John Brennan now that's not John Brennan a lot of people ask me is about a no John Brennan was a songwriter to John Brennan. But the thought is we wrote it a year ago and recorder did this summer. And that thought is our democracy. We all have seen that it's been somewhat under assault. But yet this is the time period where we as Americans. We pick democracy people have lived and god for our democracy. That's our freedom and it's worth fighting for and that's what this song is about you can not democracy down but you can't keeper down should get back up and it's up to the power of the people. And that's what the songs about. All right thank you Billy Ray check it out mark before we let you go give us your road map for the next step five days you guys headed back to North Dakota what's in store. Had not to new York state of stage people are out there are stating their friends and Stanley it's all about grabbing your friends and family and getting him out the vote. That's where this thing really matters that's where. Connections are made and that's what brings people to the polls. We're we're just focusing on getting our friends and families calling a mop. Text in hand and getting into the polls to as Billy says exercised the mother of democracy. All right mark buffalo so great to have you with this Billy Ray Cyrus a real honor to have you both think so much for sharing your story and are really glad that we could become recovery North Dakota thank you for your time. And Mary Alice and struck by. Their engagement the level of engagement North Dakota so many of these states that don't get a lot of attention in in in mid terms in presidential years for sure. Now on the math on an issue that's so important. We expect and number of races to be. Razor thing. North Dakota is just one of them sell every every age twelve they when this senate race is decided 3000 votes in 22012 so. Can be going to be close this year as well the president. Is out there trying to turn out his base and a lot of these states he's been a North Dakota as well he is now. Headed to Missouri later today did to stump in the senate race there that's where our. White House as senior national correspondent Terry Moran is just standing by he joins us now by phone Terry. I give us the scene outside of the Columbia Missouri rally site and what are you hearing from her trump supporters there. Who like you know it you know that it is it is always better spent in our country went talked got. Are recovered and scored extremely got a harder that record ought airports like Walt cultural political Walt that the country. And here that this prepare the Columbia original airport. This kind of the heart of heartland country well it Biddle the stated very. And they have spared lining up. Last night up watching people oriented web. This is close the great that he is here. You you promote. Claire McCaskill and Josh call eight. And this is that Beckett that great right now aren't here going to be back at it like he's played all hurt a little bit by target. Go after Claire McCaskill. But he is determined to get out and I gotta tell you hit it it it's the question is level of the yen yet there was time during this that your campaign. Weren't people were wondering. About Ian there was yet among Republican voters that has ended the more Donald Trump has been out on the stump. The Morse joke Republicans are he is clearly the dominant figure not just in the party. In a dominant political figure in this country and in the world he changed the rules gave up around the world. And I used it to Iraq Gartner says Yunel. You know and then he'd ordered directly with work that prepared her for. So oil and plastic car pour out. A red meat tonight for sure Terry there was a lot last night as well our colleague as you know Jonathan Karl caught up with trump at last night's rally in Fort Myers. President was optimistic as well he's been feeling the energy of the supporters here's what he had to say about his predictions. For these mid terms next week to Lewis. Democrats I remember you surprised a lot of people went strictly deal closed Schumer a year ago on the budget. Can you work with them as the Democrats when the house while we certainly try I'm looking to unify I always like unified we will certainly. They've had a very hard time because they haven't been winning and we'll see what happens in five days from now it'll be very exciting it's going to be very close race. They don't talk about the blew it anymore it's going to be a very close race. I think the senate we're looking very good we feel very good about the senate and frankly I think we feel pretty good about the house with a lot of people are so many races it's hard to it. Torture me get to every one of them. All right a lot of people so many races hard to get to Terry sounds a little bit like. The president could be conceding in the house life's gonna get a heck of a lot more difficult for him if he loses it right. Question about it that Democrats are are desperate to read picked out but you also heard him say that the blue wave has dissipated. And that he's feeling a little brother record Republicans are. Feeling better Bob the House of Representatives that they were current base to which adult. And as our work with the Democrats but the democratic base doesn't want a war with president trump. At all they ornament peas some of them. But the democratic members understand the debt to get things done if they get power they have their debit demonstrate. That they can deliver now where would have been working with the president trump it actually might be a Lincoln they're here to overlap. On crane we saw when Democrats but it welcomes the renegotiation. Perhaps there are. China is an area. Where. China. She's in spring is not the China. Illusion now and I think the Democrats. Arab republic it is a bipartisan consensus policy towards China needs to be copper. And infrastructure. So there is room quote deals to be made it if there were if the Democrats. Take sick House of Representatives still a big gift in my judgment but wouldn't that be something would pick out an archer are either party's base wouldn't want to see that. But there is there is a mutuality of interest governor there it. All right or senior Terry national correspondent Terry Moran on Columbia Missouri where the president is tonight Terry thank you so much we will see if a whom by a moment. Perhaps to come from these elections we will see between the parties. Bad it's not just the Republicans as much as president trump who's out stumping there's a lot of firepower going around on the democratic side as well big names coming out hitting the trail knocking on doors in fact today. In Atlanta we saw Oprah. Of all people knocking on doors in the governor's race there for Stacey Abrams who'd be the first African American governor. Of that state and that's where Kristin Otto has been all day long today he joins us live now from Atlanta Chris. What has Oprah been opt to and how is she being received down there in Atlanta. You know different Oprah showed up as she walked out on stage at the last event and the crowd went wild.

Stacey Abrams of the crowd loved everything Oprah had to say and you know the candidate herself beloved Oprah too she said she couldn't believe she's sitting across triple Bryan couldn't believe Oprah called for the other day. And let's listen to a little bit of what she did have the sale of an earlier here's Oprah from the star. Don't active. I just wanna say ya been all mama. Leave it on my mind and here's why you know I was just sent home in California. My been my home. But I could not stop thinking about. What's gone all down here. You are on the perhaps a plus I'm back of the buried wrestlers. All of us this Oracle and historical. Ericsson today because Stacy Abrams cares about them. Are things. That matter. And Chris. She's also us at the end of that whether she was gonna run into morning it's morning whomever those rumors Maria albums yet they're allowed us Reverend Wright SE and G-7 down pretty hard today Harris frank. Oh yeah she shut it down saying no. I want the press and all of you in the room to know. I'm not running I'm not doing this to test the waters I'm here for Stacey Abrams so after. She's come out a couple times but she really swung hard this time knocking down any rumors to Oprah's 120. Just in time to actually knock on doors that just something that volunteers and dale and then by Nelson stressed that as angry and pretty wild pretty fun and Andrew Fastow ran. I guess we don't moderately cold rain to by the limit. Really look yeah isn't here that she put out her incidentally this is the this approval is back there and can you imagine over knocking on your door the part of the bullet. There ahead of them. The bailout and a woman and the truth I'm Tyler like she might have a need to attack. They are not Kristen I'm really really exciting. Which is you never know who's gonna not come to door. I mean a bit of surprise there all right Kristin Otto in Atlanta for us we know you've got to sit down because she's about to come out thank you so much Chris for that. Let's bring richt at Klein political director back into the conversation Rick. You know the president said yesterday he has put himself on this ballot he sees himself on the ballot. Democrats who want him on the ballot as well it could he could be cruising for bruising if he gets rejected as a bit of bit of political risk in that is they're not. It is an unavoidable risk and right now we are seeing is just an entirely different map of the house and senate. He's very likely in terms of Republicans right now that the house is slipping away we are seeing in the polling received an anecdotal data the reporting that we're showing is just. They don't see a way to get traction in these Republican districts where president companies hurting them. Meanwhile in the senate we are seeing almost the exact opposite we're seeing the president a continued to draw in his his folks and we're seeing a coalescing of the Republican coalitions. And it means that you could have these entirely opposite effects that are for exactly the same reason and it's no mistake. The president trump started his his final campaign stretch in Florida State he won and he will be hitting eleven stops all of them in. Very very red or reddish parts of states that he carried two years ago. It also happens to be as you know wreck that only a third and is up for reelection every mid term cycle and this time. That third senators happened to be from really red states that threaten the CDC the bounty of that now and the president pushing disadvantage and I think it's really striking to see him out there. The interview with Jon Karl I think shows a lot of it the announcement he'll have. Later in the day on immigration all of it fitting together to the president doing what he can to rev up his BC news that it means at times stretching stretching the truth quite a bit. And Rick before I let you go I think you've always offer hats and siege wisdom on the amount of ambiguity and uncertainty and all the polling around this mid term election. On as you know well our friends at 538 say they're still for example of 15% chance that the Republicans could hold called the house. At the end of the day. How much it that uncertainty or you factory name when you're looking at at. Say exit. Polls come in and earned on Tuesday we do not know what we do not know and there are several big unknowns in this election one of them is to the Democrats change the makeup. Of the mid term electorate to they have younger more diverse people out to vote people that normally don't vote in the mid term cycle do they change that today. Turn that on in the second what is the trop effect we saw two years ago at a dramatic effect. What it means their presence felt on the ballot he is tried to get himself on the ballot as he has pointed out and I think the biggest watch court that day and with the sentiment that we talked with Billy Ray and mark. Buffalo a few minutes ago. The go out vote it doesn't matter what the polls say it doesn't matter what the prognosticators say nothing is done until the voters have their say and there's still a couple of days left for that to happen. Rick Klein political director we know your following that all the way to the finish Rick thank you so much first for sticking around in for for your insight today. Off finally we our tracking when the biggest issues this campaign. Immigration the president throwing a log on the fire is Rick just said an announcement coming later this afternoon. Are also yesterday revealing he could set up to fifty. That's where are a pentagon reporter we Martinez and has been standing by Louis thanks for sticking around. I bring us up to speed on the latest on the military deployment in what reaction did you get over there yesterday when the president. Upped the ante again took. Potentially 151000. Troops. Now I era DeVon I think the word would be surprised because then nobody who is tracking that number a year depending on. If anything reporters had been told safety 200 and it would be going to the border. Over the next week or so. I'm a tenuous Northern Command upped that to 7000 nasty new number now. Beyond that it's at 101000 at 151000 at the present was talking about nobody's really certain where that came from there have been some ideas. That he be he's incorporating the 2100 national Guardsmen have been here since April. At you can't really tell but. Either way I mean a president can't decide if he wants more troops he can do that on the net think US Northern Command has shown that pretty much if they need to adjust those numbers they can do so. Like it did the vote by upping it to 7000. At a cost of about one estimate ninety million dollars those migrants still hundreds and hundreds of miles away many of them pour some of the most impoverished people. I don't know if we still have that graphic but but our troops are headed there Louis this is this is under way what do you expect to see. In the next few days. Well you see we're seeing these pictures in these troops getting on planes arriving into the border states. I namely Texas what they're doing is they're primarily going to these large staging areas user and may your bases in the states. For example in San Antonio and Fort Bliss Soria which is right on the border and El Paso. I'm Corpus Christi which is closer to Brownsville. Now we know that Brownsville is a port of entry rate in and that's actually the closest port of entry for this new the first caravan if it's to make its way to the US. And it over the next couple weeks but. What these forces immunity before they eager ever head out to a close to the border area what they're gonna do it there are under undergoes special training. From Customs and Border Protection. They're gonna get information about what it is he can do what they can't do you when he support them because that's remember that's the real purpose of them being sent they're there to support at CBP. In their look in their duties. And so they want to make sure that everybody is trained on the rules of engagement that they know what they're going to be dealing. It could be me early next week before we actually see them. On the border itself. All right we're emerging as you know your track and all the way to the finish thank you so much for for that insight and reporting for sticking around. Pet show today that's all for us here in the briefing Herman ABC news five days to go stick with us ABC news live every step of the way through Tuesday's special coverage.

Over the last few weeks. He is focused on immigration and and that caravan as he called that he has said repeatedly that he thinks that caravan issue is a good issue for Republicans. And a Republican base in the lead up to the mid term elections. I was struck by a number of headlines and there. He said he plans to end the abuse of the asylum system in the US. It's remember that the United States is already set a record low cap on the number of refugees and asylum seekers and allows. Into the country. He also said it you'll no longer let the US government release. Those who have come across the border Seeking Asylum and then wasting and tell there have their silence hearing. He referred repeatedly to a system that he calls catch and release. I want to bring in my colleague Louis Martinez over at the Pentagon who was also pointing out. Some factual inaccuracies. In some of the the president had to say about immigration. In that catch and release system and also what he said about the building of tents on the border Lee what did you make of that speech. Mary Alice I mean what I heard as a major disconnect between what the president is saying and what we've heard me senior military officials talk about what what the purpose of the US military mission. Is to be on the border we now know that there are 7000 US military personnel are going to be headed they're in the coming weeks their variety in Texas and in Arizona as we speak. But there are constantly being told that they are there to support role. They're not there to carry out law enforcement they're not there to be catching. Migrants as they cross the border there to provide logistics are there to provide construction. Well what about that construction you heard the president say organ they're going to be building massive numbers of tents where they're gonna hallows. These individuals that he says because they're not going to be released anymore they're going to be housed in tents. That is completely different from what we've heard from the senior US military commander of US Northern Command. General Terry's shot as he was shot as he told us testing a few days ago when we asked about that. He told us known these tents and that that we are building our specifically for CBP personnel S Customs and Border Protection officers these are the individuals who. Do you carry out law enforcement duties along the border. Then the idea being that. If they're going to be pushing extra personnel to the border they need to be house somewhere that's close to it so that's why they're gonna build temporary housing. That is completely different from what we're hear from the president say that they and it's an and it would affect I think he has a concert that these are B. Detention facilities but that's not what the military tells us again he had you heard him talk about how I. I would there's been some violence associated with the second caravan that is true as it crossed the border from Guatemala into Mexico there were some violent clashes there's so. That's. The language that he uses to explain why. We need a tighter border secretive security presence with the US military figure and talk there about what if they throw rocks well maybe the US military. Could fire back yes they do have the right of self defense and yes some of these personnel will be armed. But their main duty is nine two. Carry out law enforcement along that border that is the task of CBP. So I'm in mean as I'm hearing is some kind of struck. Vital language and it's only kids it's just such a total disconnect from what we've heard here now of course he is the president. He can create policy on the spot so potentially we're gonna have to go out and ask. I'm military representatives shortly what what the president meant whether there is now going to be a new policy. And with respect to these tents and went to purpose is all along about building them and one more thing I'm you know. During a previous caravan earlier this year. There those numbers and they started with high but then were whittled down about 8500 or so. DHS at the time urged everybody in those Karen as if they wanted illegally enter the United States. And seek asylum they had to be so at a port of entry what is support of entry. That is like scent is cedar as site. And no malice in Arizona those are crossing lanes where it is there are established ports of entry from one country into another. What DHS secretary in Nielsen said the time line is if you try to cross the border. As part of his caravan in an area that is not the port of entry you're not going to be processed for asylum you're gonna be turned away and he hadn't processed by law enforcement. But if you wanted to port of entry which action the majority of those. 500 did what they had a deal is they had to wait their turn and they did wait their turn. And a very large number of them actually did gain processing for asylum so. And you know what I hear from the president today just very different from the reality that we've heard here at depending on in from what we've previously heard from the jets. And I am a there'll be a lot of questions about the detention of Stanley's if he's imagining that some of these migrants would be detained in house a news these tense. The military be building but we know there's laws on the books that that set limits to how long children and minors can be detained. As to how do you think this would play out is he is he asking for some sort of last minute change the standing loft oh what's your questions are you gonna have to bring to military officials. Well we are gonna have to ask Anderson precisely everything he just laid out because let's not forget that the military was cast at one point earlier. During year earlier family detention crisis that they would they were being overwhelmed the facilities that they contract an hour capacity. And sell ads as some of them more vulnerable now with families but kingdom and children. Too many unaccompanied children in what some certain facilities adults and others. I'm and so they did he need to reach out for additional capacity and they went to the military they got that support the military had. Identified several bases I love where it could be built up. Attack housed additional migrants but they were never actually tasked with that because the number of migrant crossings went down. The president there also ended on politics is going to be a lot of talk about the fact that he called. Stacey Abrams who's running to be the first see you now African American governor in the country's history. Not qualify for that position he's headed to Georgia to campaign for her opponent tomorrow.

Jason Segel and I share a lot of the same interests. We both love a muppet and we're both really big fans of sci-fi, and he's just written the next chapter of his \"Otherworld\" series called \"Other Earth.\" It's really fantastic. Please welcome back Jason Segel. ??? Hello, everyone. Hello, baby. Hey, this is cool. Yeah, it's not bad at all. Oh yeah. She's very happy to see you. Thank you, thank you. Now, you keep writing these wonderful young adult sci-fi novels and the last one was called \"Otherworld\" and the newest is called \"Other Earth.\" Tell everybody what this is about. I became really interested in how kids were spending so much time on social media and in the virtual world and becoming increasingly disconnected. When we did muppets together, I got to spend a lot of time with young kids, and there was something really beautiful about a kid meeting Kermit. They look right at Kermit and they can touch him and it is -- it's real and visceral and they're alive and it really moved me. And then I would see kids walking down the street just staring into their iPad or their phone, and so I wanted to write a book about being present and the difference between, you know, comparing your real life to someone else's Instagram stories. It's no wonder we feel like less than, you know. Right. And then something weird happened in the process of writing these books where all of a sudden in the political landscape our actual reality started being called into question. And so like don't believe what you see and hear, all of these ideas. It's a dangerous thing to remove people's anchor to what is real. Yeah. To make them question their own common sense and instincts, and so \"Other Earth\" is about that, what happens when your actual reality is called into question. I will tell you, my son is 16, he is such a huge fan of your books. I brought them home to read them. He took the new one from me. He was like, oh, I haven't read that one yet. So let me ask you, what is it like talking to kids about what you've written, because they are really connecting with these stories? Yeah, well, it's a real honor first of all. Like, when I was coming up, I had the Ruhle Dahl books and I had movies like \"The gonies\". So good. You're sort of told when you're a kid, you don't even realize it but to get on the track and stay there, and, you know, middle school becomes junior high and high school and then college and then your job and then maybe some day you'll get to retire but you're just sort of on it. And I had these voices that whispered in my ear, no, there's magic, like look over this way, there's buried treasure over there. I mean, when you decide to become an actor, like, this is impossible, you're told, unless you have those voices that say, no, it's not, you're special. And so I wanted to -- I wanted to whisper that voice. I love that. Yeah. You also wrote \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\". I did, yeah. Which everyone loves. Thank you. Which is maybe one of the reasons why that woman over there was cat calling you because you were naked in the movie. Yes, I was. How did you -- You're welcome by the way. How did you decide how much to show of yourself? Right. Because you showed a lot. I showed it all. I bared it all. That scene is autobiographical. I got broken up with while naked. Really? Yeah. That's terrible. Yeah. It was a really bad day. My girlfriend had been out of town and she called me from the airport and said, like, hey, are you at home? I'm back. Can I come over? I thought, yeah. I know what's about to happen. So when she arrived I was waiting for her like Burt Reynolds, you know? Oh, my gosh. Oh, no. And she walked in and I was like, I've been waiting for you. Then she said, we need to talk. Oh, no. And it's never we need to talk, I love you so much. Like this breakup commences. What didn't make the movie which also happened was like halfway through I was like, okay, I need to go get dressed. It turns out picking out an outfit for the second half of a breakup is like the worst outfit you'll ever pick out. I came out in a button up blue shirt and khaki pants like I was going to an event and I said I'm wearing your favorite outfit. But the whole time I thought as soon as she walks out this door, I'm going to write this, and it worked out. It worked out for you. That's a cold dame though, breaking up with somebody while they're nude. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I thought I was bad. No, that's terrible. Bet she misses you now. Yeah. Thank you. Jason, you've done so many successful projects \"Knocked up\", \"How I met your mother\", \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" obviously. But you've made a shift in your career. Why did you decide to do that? It kind of goes back to that thing that we were just talking about about getting on a track. I started acting when I was 17 years old. I got really lucky and I got successful pretty young. When I hit 33 years old I realized that I had not had a personal check-in in like a decade. \"How I met your mother\" came to an end and all of a sudden I was like, wow, I'm still writing \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" ten years later. I'm an adult now and like I'm not afraid of girls. I'm not trying to learn to stand on my own two feet, and I can't keep calling what I'm doing art if I don't really think about what I'm thinking about now. And so I kind of took some time off. I moved out of Los Angeles where what's next is a big question. I figured out what I wanted to write about and that's what I've been doing the past few years. I've been making movies I really care about and it's a whole different feeling. My existential crises happened at 33 too. It's very common. It's actually a very common age to have that happen, but how has the definition of success for you changed since your check-in at 33? Well, one of the things that has stayed the same is what my parents taught me, just be nice to the people around you. That's key. When I left my house to go like, you know, take on the world, the last thing my mom said to me was, never forget the person you are in this world is a reflection of the job I did as a mother. Oh, I love that. I'm using that. Yes, yes. That's good. That's a good one. Yeah. It's what mothers tend to say, like one of the things my mother said to me as a young woman, always wear clean underwear. You could walk out in the street and get hit by a bus. Doctors would have to cut your clothes off, see that you have on dirty underwear and it would be a reflection on me. And I said to her, not so much worried about me getting hit by the bus? Crazy. Yeah. You have to come back any time. I would love that. Come back and co-host one day. Yeah, you got it. Our thanks to Jason Segel.

But it required Catanuchi, who works part time cleaning offices, to switch to a less comprehensive plan, change doctors, drive farther to her appointments and pay $110 a visit out-of-pocket \u2014 or about three times what she was paying for her follow-up cancer care.\n\nShe now pays $40 a month for coverage, after she qualified for a substantial government subsidy.\n\nCatanuchi\u2019s switch to a more affordable but restrictive plan reflects a broad trend in insurance plan design over the past few years. The cheaper plans offer far narrower networks of doctors and hospitals and less coverage of out-of-network care. But many consumers are overwhelmed or unaware of the trade-offs they entail, insurance commissioners and policy experts say.\n\nWith enrollment for ACA health plans beginning Nov. 1, they worry that consumers too often lack access to clear information about which health plans have \u201cnarrow networks\u201d of medical providers or which hospitals and doctors are in or out of an insurer\u2019s network, despite federal rules requiring plans to keep up-to-date directories.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating for consumers,\u201d said Betsy Imholz, who represents the advocacy group Consumers Union at the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. \u201cHealth plan provider directories are often inaccurate, and doctors are dropping in and out all the time.\u201d\n\nThese more restrictive plans expose people to larger out-of-pocket costs, less access to out-of-network specialists and hospitals, and \u201csurprise\u201d medical bills from unforeseen out-of-network care.\n\nMore than 14 million people buy health insurance on the individual market \u2014 largely through the ACA exchanges, and they will be shopping anew this coming month.\n\nTrend Appears To Be Slowing\n\nFor 2018, 73 percent of plans offered through the exchanges were either health maintenance organizations (HMOs) or exclusive provider organizations (EPOs), up from 54 percent in 2015.\n\nBoth have more restrictive networks and offer less out-of-network coverage compared with preferred provider organizations (PPOs), which represented 21 percent of health plans offered through the ACA exchanges in 2018, according to Avalere, a health research firm in Washington, D.C.\n\nPPOs typically provide easier access to out-of-network specialists and facilities, and partial \u2014 sometimes even generous \u2014 payment for such services.\n\nMeasured another way, the number of ACA plans offering any out-of-network coverage declined to 29 percent in 2018 from 58 percent in 2015, according to a recent analysis by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nFor example, in California, HMO and EPO enrollment through Covered California, the state\u2019s exchange, grew from 46 percent in 2016 to 70 percent in 2018, officials there said. Over the same period, PPO enrollment declined from 54 percent to 30 percent.\n\nIn contrast, PPOs have long been and remain the dominant type of health plan offered by employers nationwide. Forty-nine percent of the 152 million people and their dependents who were covered through work in 2018 were enrolled in a PPO-type plan. Only 16 percent were in HMOs, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s annual survey of employment-based health insurance.\n\nThe good news for people buying health insurance on their own is that the trend toward narrow networks appears to be slowing.\n\n\u201cWhen premiums shot up over the past few years, insurers shifted to more restrictive plans with smaller provider networks to try and lower costs and premiums,\u201d said Chris Sloan, a director at Avalere. \u201cWith premium increases slowing, at least for now, that could stabilize.\u201d\n\nSome research supports this prediction. Daniel Polsky, a health economist at the University of Pennsylvania, found that the number of ACA plans nationwide with narrow physician networks declined from 25 percent in 2016 to 21 percent in 2017.\n\nPolsky is completing an analysis of 2018 plans and expects the percent of narrow network plans to remain \u201crelatively constant\u201d for this year and into 2019.\n\n\u201cFewer insurers are exiting the marketplace, and there\u2019s less churn in the plans being offered,\u201d said Polsky. \u201cThat\u2019s good news for consumers.\u201d\n\nInsurers may still be contracting with fewer hospitals, however, to constrain costs in that expensive arena of care, according to a report by the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. It found that 53 percent of plans had narrow hospital networks in 2017, up from 48 percent in 2014.\n\n\u201cNarrow networks are a trade-off,\u201d said Paul Ginsburg, a health care economist at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThey can be successful when done well. At a time when we need to find ways to control rising health care costs, narrow networks are one legitimate strategy.\u201d\n\nGinsburg also notes that there\u2019s no evidence to date that the quality of care is any less in narrow versus broader networks, or that people are being denied access to needed care.\n\nMike Kreidler, Washington state\u2019s insurance commissioner, said ACA insurers in that state \u201care figuring out they can\u2019t get away with provider networks that are inadequate to meet people\u2019s needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople have voted with their feet, moving to more affordable choices like HMOs but they won\u2019t tolerate draconian restrictions,\u201d Kreidler said.\n\nThe state is stepping in, too. In December 2017, Kreidler fined one insurer \u2014 Coordinated Care \u2014 $1.5 million for failing to maintain an adequate network of doctors. The state suspended $1 million of the fine if the insurer had no further violations. In March 2018, the plan was docked another $100,000 for similar gaps, especially a paucity of specialists in immunology, dermatology and rheumatology. The $900,000 in potential fines continues to hang over the company\u2019s head.\n\nCentene Corp, which owns Coordinated Care, has pledged to improve its network.\n\nPennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Jessica Altman said she expects residents buying insurance in the individual marketplace for 2019 to have a wider choice of providers in their networks.\n\n\u201cWe think and hope insurers are gradually building more stable networks of providers,\u201d said Altman.\n\nNew State Laws\n\nBad publicity and recent state laws are pushing insurers to modify their practices and shore up their networks.\n\nAbout 20 states now have laws restricting surprise bills or balance billing, or which mandate mediation over disputed medical bills, especially those stemming from emergency care.\n\nEven more have rules on maintaining accurate, up-to-date provider directories.\n\nThe problem is the laws vary widely in the degree to which they \u201ctruly protect consumers,\u201d said Claire McAndrew, a health policy analyst at Families USA, a consumer advocacy group in Washington, D.C. \u201cIt\u2019s a patchwork system with some strong consumer protections and a lot of weaker ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome states don\u2019t have the resources to enforce rules in this area,\u201d said Justin Giovannelli, a researcher at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. \u201cThat takes us backward in assuring consumers get coverage that meets their needs.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

She later moved to Hawaii and eventually California to attend the University of Southern California. She owned or managed several businesses before making her way into the public sphere in 1990. Kim spent two decades working for outgoing GOP Rep. Ed Royce, first when he was a state senator and later in Congress. She ended her post with him as the director of community operations and Asian affairs.\n\nShe was then elected to the California Assembly in 2014, where she unseated an incumbent and became the first Korean-American woman to serve in the California House.\n\nNow the Republican is running for Congress in a district that is, at the very least, skeptical of President Donald Trump.

A few hours later, the little girl was brought to a room at the Steuben County child advocacy center instead of a typical police interrogation room. This room was still small but had a soft seating and toys.\n\nPolice recorded video of their conversation with Charlie, which was played in open court.\n\n\"20/20\" obtained the video of little Charlie describing to investigators, in a matter-of-fact manner, the details of what police say were her mother\u2019s final moments.\n\nDuring the interview, her mother's blood was still visible on her shirt. Kelley Clayton had been bludgeoned to death.\n\n\u201cIn the middle of the night, this guy came and started hitting my mom with like this pipe thingy,\u201d Charlie is heard telling Sheriff Allard and New York State Police Investigator Dianne Trickey.\n\n\u201cThere was blood everywhere,\" she said. \"On my door, on the floor. Not on the carpet though. And I thought she was dead when she was lying on the ground in the blood.\u201d\n\nCharlie labeled the intruder as \"a robber\" and recalled her mother screaming \u201cRun, Charlie Run!\u201d as, she said, the man chased Kelley Clayton downstairs.\n\n\u201cI saw the robber like hitting her until she was on the ground,\u201d the child is heard telling investigators on the video. \u201cShe was sort of suffering. Then I hugged her leg.\u201d\n\nThe 7-year-old told authorities then that the robber had on dark jeans, a long-sleeved shirt and a mask.\n\nAllard told \u201c20/20\u201d that Charlie said the mask was similar to one her father wore when he went hunting.\n\n\u201cHe looked like my dad,\u201d she said. When asked if the man was big or little, she also responded \u201cThe size of my dad.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything was 'just like daddy,'\u201d Allard told \"20/20.\" \u201cEvery question I asked her related back to daddy and then she looks at me. She goes, \u2018But it couldn't have been daddy because then who would take care of us?\u2019\u201d\n\nAllard believed Charlie\u2019s statement was truthful and was struck at how emotionless she appeared to be at that time.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if she was still in shock but there were no tears on her part,\" he said.\n\n\"I thought, 'When is this girl going to be able to cry because she just witnessed something no child should ever have to see, the most important person in her life just be destroyed.' It just broke my heart.\u201d\n\nBefore leaving the interview room, investigators said Charlie Clayton turned to them to ask them a question: \u201cIt\u2019s about my mom,\u201d she said. \u201cLike where is she at?\u201d\n\nAllard and the child forensic investigator told Charlie they would find out the answer for her, believing that was not the appropriate time and place to reveal to the little girl that her mother had died.\n\nIn part because of her statement, Charlie\u2019s father Thomas Clayton was arrested later that day, Sept. 29, 2015, for the murder of his wife. Thomas Clayton was the one who had called 911 after midnight that day when he said he had returned home from a poker game and found her body on the kitchen floor.\n\nCharlie and her younger brother Cullen were sent to live with their aunt, Kim Bourgeois.\n\nInvestigators began piecing together what happened and trying to make sense of a seemingly senseless murder that rocked the small town in upstate New York. A police officer\u2019s body camera had captured the savage brutality of the scene.\n\n\u201cThis was an extremely brutal attack, a very gruesome situation,\u201d Donald Lewis, an investigator for the Steuben County Sheriff\u2019s Office who was on the scene that night, told \"20/20\" in a previous interview.\n\n\u201c[It was] some sort of attack in the upstairs area down the hallways,\u201d he continued. \u201cDown the stairs, there was a hole in the sheet rock at the bottom of the stairs and a blood trail that ended at Mrs. Clayton's body in the kitchen area.\u201d\n\nLewis said Kelley Clayton had died of blunt force trauma after being beaten with a fiberglass maul handle. Investigators determined there had been no signs of forced entry or robbery.\n\nWhile looking into Thomas Clayton\u2019s alibi, police learned that a woman at the poker game said he asked to borrow her cellphone to make a call just 90 minutes before he got home to find his wife\u2019s body. Investigators\u2019 suspicion quickly turned toward Kelley's husband.\n\nBut a subsequent police investigation revealed a twist in the case -- Thomas Clayton hadn't killed his wife. He had hired a man named Michael Beard, who initially told police Clayton had promised him $10,000 to carry out the murder.\n\nDuring an interview with police, Michael Beard, who had recently been fired at the same company where Thomas Clayton worked, confessed to investigators that his former boss had asked him to kill Kelley and burn the house down so Clayton could collect the insurance money. Beard never ended up setting the house on fire.\n\n\u201cI think he got scared and ran away,\u201d said New York State Investigator Jim Vaughn who took Beard's confession. It was an extremely violent confrontation. I don't think he was expecting that.\"\n\nThe carnage could have been worse: the Clayton children were home that night and could have died in a fire.\n\nNevertheless, both Thomas Clayton and Michael Beard were convicted of first and second degree murder and are currently serving life sentences without the possibility of parole in different New York State prisons.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a cold-blooded killer,\" said Vaughn of Clayton.\n\n\u201cIf his plan had come to fruition, he would be done with his wife and his children,\u201d Kelley's sister, Kim Bourgeois, told \"20/20.\"\n\n\u201cHe would've collected my sister's million dollar life insurance policy,\" she said. \"Survivor benefits from the children. Homeowners insurance. He would've truly benefited financially from the death of all of them.\u201d\n\nThomas Clayton has appealed his case, claiming that prosecutors did not prove that he was guilty of his wife\u2019s murder. In a statement to ABC News, his family said, \u201cOur support for Thomas is unwavering. Our love for Kelley, Charlie, Cullen and Thomas is unending. To know Thomas would be to know that he would never kill another human being nor would he send another person in to his home to kill another human being, most of all his wife, the mother of his children.\"\n\n\"To know Thomas would be to know that he would never put his children in the horrific situation they were put in that night, and the days since,\" the statement continued. \"All we can do now is hope, believe and pray that the justice system will right this incredible wrong.\u201d\n\nBeard, too, is planning to appeal his case. He says that Charlie\u2019s description of the killer having \u201ceyes like daddy\u201d clears him because he is a 6-foot-1, 200-pound African-American man who looks nothing like Thomas Clayton.\n\nBut police say that in addition to Charlie\u2019s description of what happened that night her mother was killed, \"the robber's\" clothing she described matches exactly with Beard's bloody clothes that police later recovered. Beard also led police to the murder weapon and keys to the Clayton home, which had been tossed into the woods.\n\nThe Clayton children have been very resilient after their mother's death and are doing well but are still scarred by the situation, according to Bourgeois. Charlie is now 10 years old and her brother Cullen is now 6.\n\n\u201cCharlie still does not speak of it,\" she said. \"She rarely talks about her mom. It\u2019s too painful,\u201d she said. \u201cCullen still cries out at night \u2018I miss my mommy. I want my mommy.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe family is also very thankful for the support from the community -- which has raised money for Charlie and Cullen.\n\nPurple ribbons, the symbol for domestic violence, now dot the nearby towns of Elmira and Corning, New York. \u201cThe kids will see purple ribbons, and they\u2019ll say \u2018Oh, purple for Mama, purple for Mama.\u2019 Everywhere we go, \u2018Look, that\u2019s for Mama.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe children have no contact with their father.\n\nIn a letter to the court, Charlie wrote, \u201cI feel like dad is a coward because he asked Michael Beard to kill my mom.\u201d", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "President Donald Trump has told State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert that he wants to nominate her to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, a senior White House official told ABC News.\n\nIt is unclear whether she has accepted his offer concerning the position, now held by Nikki Haley, who said she would leave by the end of the year.\n\nBut when asked about Nauert later Thursday, President Trump said while she is \"under very serious consideration,\" he had not yet made a final decision and wouldn't until next week.\"\n\n\"She's been a supporter for a long time, and she's really excellent,\" he said of Nauert.\n\nNauert has been the department spokesperson since April 2017 after a career as a broadcast journalist at ABC News and an anchor at Fox News. After Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was fired, she was promoted to acting under secretary of state for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs.\n\nNauert met President Trump at the White House on Monday, two sources told ABC News -- her second meeting with the president about the role.\n\nThe role requires Senate confirmation.", "President Donald Trump's latest campaign ad featuring an immigrant who was convicted of killing police officers is being criticized as racist and drawing parallels to another controversial commercial that seemed to play on the same fears 30 years ago.\n\nLuis Bracamontes is a Mexican immigrant who was sentenced to the death penalty in April after being convicted of killing two California sheriff's deputies in 2014. Bracamontes' penchant for curse-laden rants about killing cops got him expelled from the courtroom and earned him a place in one of Trump's campaign ads in January.\n\nTrump's latest ad featuring Bracamontes uses video of him in court with text overlays that say he \u201ckilled our people!\u201d and claims that \u201cDemocrats let him into our country\u201d and \u201cDemocrats let him stay.\u201d That's followed by footage of people who appear to be part of a migrant caravan pushing down gates, along with another immigrant\u2019s interview and his alleged history of attempted murder. Text then appears asking: \u201cWho else would Democrats let in?\u201d The ad offers no evidence for claims that Democrats let Bracamontes, who was deported twice, into the country.\n\nThe ad was released on Oct. 31, just six days before the midterms. It was also released on the same day that the Trump administration announced it would be increasing the number of U.S. troops at the southern border from just over 5,000 to 10,000 or 15,000 to deal with the migrant caravan Trump has repeatedly claimed qualifies as an invasion.\n\nKim Fridkin, a political science professor at Arizona State University who specializes in negative ads, said Trump's latest offering \"is playing to racial fears of 'the other.'\"\n\n\"He's portraying immigrants as criminals basically, so in that way, I think it has racial undertones or overtones,\" Fridkin said.\n\nRich Pedroncelli/AP\n\nMo Elleithee, the executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Institute of Politics and Public Service, was more frank.\n\n\u201cI think it is one of the most racist ads we've seen in a long time,\u201d said Elleithee, who worked as a campaign strategist for Hillary Clinton and was a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. \u201cIt is preying on people's fear of immigrants, and to the extent that anyone\u2019s motivated by racism, that clearly taps into that.\u201d\n\nTrump has pinned the ad to the top of his Twitter timeline, writing: \"It is outrageous what the Democrats are doing to our Country. Vote Republican now!\"\n\nBut the president's critics also took to Twitter to critique the ad. Al Cardenas, a former chairman of the Florida Republican Party and former chair of the American Conservative Union, was one of them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about you,\u201d Cardenas wrote in a tweet responding to Trump\u2019s tweet with the ad. \u201cAttacking the GOP Speaker a week before the elections is egomaniacal & counterproductive. I really, really despise your politics & your harmful impact on our country\u2019s social fabric.\u201d\n\nSen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, who has also been critical of Trump, tweeted Thursday that \u201cThis is a sickening ad. Republicans everywhere should denounce it.\u201d\n\nBoth Elleithee and Fridkin compared Trump\u2019s ad to the one that featured felon Willie Horton during the 1988 presidential election and was produced by a group that supported George H.W. Bush\u2019s bid. At the time, the Horton ad was widely seen as one of the most controversial political ads in modern American history.\n\n\u201cI think that when people, political scientists, hear the word \u2018Willie Horton,\u2019 what they remember is the ad that was trying to illicit race as an issue and try to play to people's fears of blacks as perpetrators of a crime,\u201d Fridkin said, adding that she sees this Trump ad as having a similar message but applying it to immigrants.\n\n\u201cI think it is on the same level and that ad,\u201d she said of the Horton ad.\n\nLawrence Eagle Tribune/AP\n\nABC News political analyst Matt Dowd went further, saying that it \"ranks up there with the Willie Horton ad, but I think this is even worse.\"\n\n\"It is the most divisive ad I have seen created since the advent of television and the internet,\" Dowd said.\n\nElleithee said that this ad plays into the anger that Trump and other Republicans are using to \u201cmotivate and mobilize their base\u201d ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.\n\n\u201cWhat we're seeing is him preying on racist elements in order to tap into fear, and I don\u2019t think anyone can argue that it's anything other than blatant, racist fear mongering,\u201d Elleithee said.\n\nThis upcoming election \u201chas been a fear and anger election\u201d on both sides, Elleithee said, noting that \u201cDemocrats have been angry every day after 2016\u201d and are \u201cchanneling that anger into political activism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere has been an enthusiasm gap and the president is trying to narrow that gap\u201d by trying to tap into his base, Elleithee said.\n\nDowd agreed, saying the ad is all about \"trying to incite his base on this issue before Election Day,\" but warned that it could hurt Republican candidates.\n\n\"Any help it might provide the GOP among the base is going to hurt the GOP twice as much among independent voters who will decide this election,\" he said.", "bad url", "Transcript for Oprah Winfrey campaigns for Democrat Stacey Abrams in Georgia's governor's race\n\nI am an independent woman.

Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nTrump said the White House is finalizing plans to require migrants to \u201cpresent themselves lawfully at a point of entry,\u201d and that he would sign a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d executive order \u201csometime next week.\u201d\n\nUnder current law, immigrants may apply for asylum regardless of how they enter the country. Trump\u2019s said his order would require them to apply at a port of entry.\n\nRefugees International said in reaction that the president's plan to consider asylum seekers entering only at legal ports of entry is illegal under a United Nations treaty that the U.S. ratified, which says applicants entering illegally should not be penalized if they present themselves without delay and show good cause for their illegal entry.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump did not announce an immigration policy this afternoon, but repeatedly lied about the asylum system, his family separation policy, and his largely unfunded wall. If he plans at some point to prohibit people from applying for asylum between the ports of entry, that plan is illegal,\u201d Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, said in a statement.\n\nFor the first time, Trump also seemed to threaten the use of force against migrants at the border.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re throwing rocks viciously and violently,\u201d he claimed, referring to an encounter between the migrants and Mexican police. \u201cThey want to throw rocks at our military, our military is going to fight back.\u201d\n\nAsked if the military troops being sent to the border might fire on migrants, Trump responded, \"I hope not.\" But he quickly added, \"Anybody throwing rocks ... we will consider that a firearm.\u201d\n\nOn whether the military at southern border might fire on migrants, Pres Trump says \"I hope not.\" \"I hope there won't be that, but I will tell you this \u2013 anybody throwing rocks... we will consider that a firearm, because there's not much difference.\" https://t.co/fyk1ncmiwj pic.twitter.com/OGbFHFhB3A \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) November 1, 2018\n\nAsked about rock throwing again, Trump responded, \"We're not going to put up with that. If they want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. We're going to consider -- and I told them, consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks like they did at the Mexico military and police, I say, consider it a rifle.\"\n\nU.S. military officials have said repeatedly that the more than 7,000 active duty forces being sent to the border will serve only in a support role to Customs and Border Protection (CBP). By law, they cannot carry out law enforcement duties and are not supposed to come into contact with migrants crossing the border.\n\nThe troops will be armed and have the right to self-defense, but because they are in a support role they may not come into contact with the migrants.\n\nAsked about Trump\u2019s comments Thursday, a U.S. defense official referred to what Gen. Terrence O\u2019Shaughnessy, the commander of U.S. Northern Command, said earlier this week about what he called the \u201cstandard rules for the use of force.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Shaughnessy told Pentagon reporters on Monday that \u201c... we have these rules in place for a reason. It allows us to have a very standardized set that applies to multiple situations. Our forces are trained to that.\u201d\n\nMilitary rules of engagement are typically not made public, but they are usually escalatory, with proportional responses to a variety of threats, including the use of non-lethal deterrence before a use of force can be used.\n\nHe added that the active duty forces will also receive training so that their rules of engagement are compatible with CBP\u2019s.\n\nLater, a Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Jamie Davis, responded, \u201cWe will not discuss hypothetical situations or specific measures within our rules on the use of force, but our forces are trained professionals who always have the inherent right of self-defense. I would also emphasize that our forces are in support of DHS/CBP, who are performing law enforcement activities.\u201c\n\nNo country can allow itself to be \"overwhelmed by masses of people rushing our border,\" Trump said.\n\nHe urged migrants in the caravan traveling towards the U.S. \u2013 Mexico border to \u201cturn back now,\u201d again likening the dwindling procession still approximately 900 miles away from the border to an \u201cinvasion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are tough people in many cases,\u201d Trump said, adding that the caravan of men, women and children is full of \u201cyoung men, strong men\u201d who are \u201cnot legitimate asylum seekers,\u201d again providing no evidence to back up that claim.\n\n\u201cAsylum is not a program for those living in poverty,\u201d he said. \u201cAsylum is a very special protection intended for those fleeing government persecution based on race, religion and other protected status.\" Many migrants, including from Honduras and Guatemala, have said they are fleeing gang violence after family members have been murdered or threatened. They may be able to claim that if a government doesn't protect a group of people from gang violence it could be considred state-sanctioned.\n\nTrump also repeated comments he's made in recent interviews that migrants seeking asylum will be kept in tent cities, rather than released until their cases are adjudicated in immigration court. Trump said \"we're putting up massive tent cities\" with \"the military's help\" although a defense official said Thursday that the Pentagon had received no request to set up tents for detained migrants.\n\nThe president also made a number of false claims, suggesting that the Obama administration, and not the Trump administration, separated families at the border, that most asylum seekers don\u2019t show up for their court dates, a claim debunked by PolitiFact, and that Democrats want migrants to vote and to sign them up for free health care, welfare and education, a claim also contradicted by PolitiFact.\n\nThe president's remarks came just before he headed to another campaign rally as part of a pre-election blitz, this one in Columbia, Missouri, and after he has also called for ending birthright citizenship and sending thousands of additional troops to the border as a caravan of migrants makes its way toward the United States from Central America.\n\nRobert Zepeda/ABC News\n\nThe president has made immigration the centerpiece of his closing argument ahead of Tuesday\u2019s midterm election.\n\n\u201cRepublicans want strong borders, no crime, no chaos, and no caravans. Democrats want open borders, and they want to invite caravan after caravan into our country, which brings crime upon crime,\u201d Trump said at a campaign rally in Fort Myers, Florida, on Tuesday.\n\nAfter denying that his heated rhetoric over immigration is fear mongering before voters head to the polls to ABC News\u2019 Mary Bruce, the president tweeted a controversial and racially charged digital ad produced by the White House focusing on an undocumented immigrant convicted of murdering two California sheriff's deputies in 2014 to suggest there were many more like him -- and using footage of migrants trying to break down gates along the Mexican border when the caravan has been mostly peaceful.\n\nIn addition to increasing the presence of U.S. Army National Guard troops on the border, the president has called for ending birthright citizenship. Trump claims birthright citizenship is not guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, but many legal scholars and lawmakers \u2013 including House Speaker Paul Ryan, a fellow top Republican \u2013 disagree.\n\nThe president lashed out at Ryan over voicing his criticism of ending birthright citizenship.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats want to continue giving automatic birthright citizenship to every child born to an illegal alien,\u201d Trump said. Even if they've been on our soil for only a matter of seconds, hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant children are made automatic citizens every year because of this crazy policy, and they are made instantly eligible for every privilege and benefit of American citizenship at a cost of billions of dollars a year.\u201d\n\nABC News' Elizabeth McLaughlin.

Google and there's another workers are walking off the job they are protesting. The Internet companies treatment of executives accused of sexual misconduct that walkout includes. Workers at Google's headquarters Wright and Chelsea this is a live picture right now from news copter seven you see that huge crowd right there. Eyewitness News reporter Andy Berkett is there as well and Jack. Especially the walkout began around at 11 o'clock this morning good torque is getting up from their desks and walking out leaving the company's offices here on eight. Avenue. The walkout became all march and a rally she saw. From the chopper other numbers are difficult to estimate that several hundred people took part in this. By our conservative estimate about a thousand people left. The Google offices here in Manhattan this morning they are protesting as you said the company's employment practices specifically. The company's policies and practices with respect to sexual harassment. It all appears to stem from reports the company paid millions in severance packages to male executives accused of harassment. And then did this quietly Google initially insisted that the criticisms were overblown but has since apologized and promised reforms in fact the walk out I understand sanctioned by management. It's happening at all of the company's offices worldwide today. Here's a some of the protesters explained their reactions. And why they're walking out. Allow Google to enforce the provisions of Tea Party happened to have. It takes seriously claims of people who are harassed and respond to them appropriately and not sweep them under the rug. I was more a night. It's a good thing that's happening ever coming out in standing up for ourselves. We're kind of have a little people here so hopefully if some of the half student. You know it only got ripple effect definitely. Well now back in the like that you can see the employees are now returning. To work yes it was a protest at the company's culture that quite severance packages paid to male employees but it's important to note.

Add Flu Season as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Flu Season news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\n\u201cNo, doc. When I was younger I would get it and always get sick, so now -- at my age -- I think I will pass on it this year and take my chances.\u201d\n\nThis a very common exchange across all primary care providers\u2019 offices at this time of the year -- and a great opportunity to really try to understand why Mrs. Jones feels that the vaccines made her sick, and an opportunity for educational awareness about the flu vaccine.\n\nThe influenza, or flu, is responsible for approximately 20,000 deaths per year on average in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe American Academy of Family Physicians states that every year about 130,000 people go to a hospital with the flu.\n\nAn effective, important way to protect yourself is by getting a flu shot -- which cannot actually give you the flu. There are many reasons why people don\u2019t get the flu vaccine, but I hope that you will find facts and clarifications on common misconceptions about the vaccine below.\n\n1. What is the flu?\n\nInfluenza is an infection in the nose, throat and lungs caused by a virus. This may be the worst cold of your life.\n\n2. What are some of the symptoms of the flu?\n\nThe flu starts suddenly and hits hard. You\u2019ll probably feel weak and tired, and have a fever, dry cough, runny nose, chills, muscle aches, severe headache, eye pain and a sore throat.\n\n3. How does the vaccine work?\n\nFlu vaccines causes antibodies (cells responsible to fight off an infection) to develop in the body about two weeks after you get the shot. These antibodies provide protection against the virus. The seasonal flu vaccine protects against the influenza viruses that research indicates will be most common during the upcoming season. Traditionally it protects against three types of influenza: influenza A (H1N1), influenza A (H3N2) and influenza B.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\n4. Can I take medications instead of the flu shot?\n\nNo, medications do not cure and are not recommended instead of the flu shot. Antibiotics don\u2019t work against viruses. Some prescriptions can help treat flu symptoms. The medicines work by reducing the severity of symptoms if you start taking them soon after you begin to get sick.\n\n5. What are side effects of the flu vaccine?\n\nThe side effects are mild and brief depending on if you get the flu shot or nasal spray, especially when compared to the symptoms of a bad case of the flu:\n\nFlu shot: soreness, redness or swelling where the shot was given, fever (low grade), aches\n\nNasal spray: runny nose, wheezing, headache, vomiting, muscle aches, fever\n\n6. Does the vaccine work right away?\n\nNo, it takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body and provide protection against influenza. This is why you may develop the flu around the time you get a vaccine because you were exposed prior to getting the vaccine and were not protected at the time you got infected.\n\n7. Can the flu vaccine give me the flu?\n\nNo, although people do tend to link the two. The vaccine cannot cause a flu illness. The vaccine either has a killed (inactivated) form of the virus that is not infectious or it is made with proteins from a flu vaccine virus that is attenuated, or \u201cweakened,\u201d and therefore cannot cause the flu.\n\n8. What are the benefits of the flu vaccine?\n\nThe obvious one is that it keeps you from getting sick with the flu, reduces risk of hospitalization from the flu and protects people around you.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\n9. Where can I get the vaccine?\n\nGrocery stores, pharmacies and doctor\u2019s offices and hospitals offer flu shots. It does not matter where you go because they all use the same vaccine. It\u2019s important just to get the flu vaccine as soon as possible.\n\n10. Can I get flu even though I got a flu vaccine this year?\n\nYes, unfortunately you may be exposed to a flu virus shortly before getting vaccinated, or because you may be exposed to a type of flu that is not included in the seasonal flu vaccine. The vaccine is not foolproof, but it is the best way to protect against flu infection.\n\nFor more information, speak to your doctor or go on CDC\u2019s vaccine supply & distribution web site.\n\nDr. Tambetta Ojong is a family medicine resident at SUNY Downstate Medical Center and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.", "Interested in Midterm Elections?

In other words, with three days until Election Day, more people had already voted in the 30 largest counties in Texas in 2018 than did in total in 2014.\n\nIn a state with a contentious Senate race with a progressive candidate, Texans may be more motivated to vote as Democrats hope to turn the Senate blue.\n\nGeorgia is following the same trend. 2014 statewide totals came out to 1,069,912. The state has already seen a 155.4 percent uptick from that number, with 1,662,373 ballots cast as of Wednesday morning, according to the secretary of state's office.\n\nA close gubernatorial race is unfolding in that state between current Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams. If Abrams wins, she would be the first female African-American governor in the nation.\n\nKemp, who is backed by President Donald Trump has advocated for stronger voter identification laws and has faced criticism over the more than 53,000 voter applications that were put on hold due to the state\u2019s restrictive \u201cexact match\u201d laws \u2013 regulations which require voters' information on the rolls exactly match their government-issued identification. A coalition of civil rights groups has sued over the law which they say disenfranchises minority voters.\n\nIf Abrams hopes to win, she\u2019ll need those votes.\n\nMcDonald breaks down the numbers by state, mail-in and in-person ballots.\n\nOverall, as of Friday, early vote numbers were far higher than in 2014:\n\n-Total ballots cast as of 11/2/18: 30,257,820\n\n-Total ballots cast as of 11/02/14: 17,000,000\n\nWhile these numbers represent a huge uptick in the early vote -- a strong signal of enthusiasm -- it also is a result of many states expanding early voting opportunities.\n\nAs of Friday morning, 27 states plus the District of Columbia had surpassed their 2014 early vote totals, with four days remaining until Election Day.\n\nMcDonald said on Twitter he estimates more to join this list.\n\nIn Arizona, home to one of this cycle's most competitive U.S. Senate races, Republicans make up 42.3 percent of the early ballots cast, while Democrats comprise 33.7 percent, as of Friday.\n\nIn Georgia, the youth share of the early voting electorate (18-29) has doubled compared to the last midterm election in the state, from 4 percent in 2014 to 9.4 percent in 2018.

They're also apparently some problems found within the football program itself Bryce said this is us. In the University of Maryland didn't do the right thing right away that kind of had to be forced to but just unpack what happened Jordan hare. I was a freshman football player. And he suffered heat stroke and a spring practice so there are allegations after his staff he died a couple weeks after he passed on practiced. There are allegations of a toxic culture within the program so what happened is in August. So several months ago. Coach Durkin was placed on paid administrative leave they conducted two separate investigations one of those investigations. Was conducted by the Maryland board of regents which oversees the State's universities okay. They found. After there after their investigation concluded that there was not a toxic culture but quote the athletic department lacked a culture. Of accountability. They reinstate him on Tuesday. All right and then after a backlash than talking just a firestorm of backlash from. Along even the governor called on the University of Maryland. Two to consider reinstating DJ Durkin and listen to this TV net com op Ed in the Washington Post from.

If this was the president this wasn't the border regions the university. President decided to usurp the board of regents. He terminated. 24 hours after the board. Had reinstated them so that's kind of where we are right now but DJ Durkin you know this open did the university up to possible legal claims. He can see them. For wrongful termination so this is going to be anything but a clean separation the clean break.

Here's some of the things he had to say. Okay you're talking about 101000 maybe 151000. Active duty US military to the border. More than we have fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan more than we have fighting crisis in Syria he really. He really anything that's very important we have to have a wall of people very highly trained people. To retreat dedicated patriots this what they. You have caravans coming up that look a lot larger than its report and actually I mean I'm pretty good it. Estimating crowd size and I will tell you they look a lot bigger than people would think what we see is deeply. Impoverished people fleeing violence many of them women and children get a cent. 151000. Active duty US military mostly men and it's actually mostly young man and a lot of rust people a lot of rough people giant that pushing the women right up into the front not good that pushing that you. Kids right up to the front but they're not in a hundred miles away the the active duty military you know a lot I mean you're the president that they they can't arrest. People crossing the border at Penn State and national emergency ever zoo. National emergency covers a lot of Terry the candidate they invade a country you look at that always looks like an invasion into it doesn't look like an invasion care centers and an Asian. Oh I think so I think when you look at some of them. When you look at some of the people within the caravan yeah I think it could be considered an invasion of our country we can't have some of the poorest people in the world come. This is dangerous people these are some of people. We knew look at MS thirteen they come from that area this is a very rough group of people coming up. Not at all cases but this is a very rough group of people look what they did to the Mexican army. At the border look at the skirmish they just at that was a very bad thing for the Mexican army that was not easy and finally I remember you river well in the campaign. You made a promise he so I will never lied to you. So can tell me now honestly have you. Kept that promise at all times that you always what I try Amanda do try I think you try to you say things about me that are not. Necessarily correct I do try and I always want to tell the truth when I can I tell the truth and sometimes it turns out to be where something happens it's different or does it change but. I always like to be truthful. And I laundry Karen Travers now is that the White House that Karen big until a lot of different topics during his inner view what we're some of the big takeaways. I think just again how the president Diane continues to make immigration the critical focus of his. Final push to the mid term elections this is his rally cry right now for Republican voters and he's talking about that caravan of migrants as an invasion of the United States he's using language like that. To justify why he is sending US service members down to the border town Carl pushing him on that about why that is necessary in the president says. It's because this is a rough group of people he says they're criminals. But he not providing evidence of that and certainly by all accounts from the reporting down there is made up well a lot of families too there have been some skirmishes that for the most part. This is several hundred people now may be couple thousand who have been walking miles and miles from 900 miles away from the US border the day the president calling it a national emergency one that requires the military certainly a lot of criticism that this is to scare tactics. To drive up support next week and get Republicans out to the polls. And it is a big campaign issue for the president for the Republicans in general. I know the president was saying all this at a Florida rally last night or while he was doing a Florida rather last night where is he headed today and what other point today expected to focus on. Look for immigration to again be a central part of the president's message tonight heading to Missouri though. This is day two of will be a six today eat stayed eleven rallied campaign blitz it takes the president right up to Tuesday's mid term elections. Yesterday there was a moment Diane at that rally where he was asking the really fired up Brock is crowd how many of you here in Florida have already voted. Early learning is very critical in Florida and in the boat when all the people in the crowd started cheering. He said well what am I doing here that sounds like you've all already gotten to the polls do that's what he's trying to do out on the trail is to get people out to get them to vote. Lock them in. Think it's also notable in that interview with Jon Karl the president sounded very bullish about the republicans' chances of holding control of the senate after next Tuesday. Less so about the house. Diane the president is going to states and have very critical senate races Missouri West Virginia Tennessee Indiana Montana. Not focusing as much in this critical congressional district.

One of the black boxes and David Curley is monitoring all of this forest a David what can this tell us. So this is the data recorder it's the flight data recorder. It they didn't recover the entire what we would call a black box but they found the most important part which is where the data is stored inside that recorder. And it was actually brought up and put into a tanker a tub. But like kind of a cooler filled with while we're too which which is standard operating procedure the Indonesians say it's gonna take them a week to read out. That data recorders seems. A little long. Compared to what would happen in the west either in the United States France or Britain or someplace else but at least they have. That part of the black box now the other black box is still missing. That is the cockpit voice. Recorder. Here's the difference the flight data recorders gonna tell you what the engines were doing where the aircraft was over the inputs from the pilots see you get all that data of what what the plane was doing. The voice recorder which they don't have yet. Is inside the cockpit you hear what the pilots were saying to each other you can actually hear the noises of the engines of others. Anything an explosion or anything else you can hear warning bells going off in their different warning chimes with in the cockpit that would tell you what's going on. So it will be important a fine that. But at least they have one of them now and Diane I would add that there is some question because this was a real leading news 737 the latest version. It's called a Max eight. It had the capability to send data to the ground so even in flight there's a chance that Boeing. And GE which makes is a partner in making the engines and the airline actually have. Had data since the flight on Monday. And haven't shared we asked Boeing and GE do they have data already. About this flight and they declined to comment to us so major break this is really good news. They're still is more to come they need to find that voice we're. Quarters well hand sounds unusual that question about. If they have data and why they wouldn't share but it David in do they have any theories any closer idea to what actually happened here. Will we have heard from sources that terrorism has basically no been ruled out they don't think that it was. Anything to do with terrorism now we do know that this aircraft the same aircraft. On the flight before this which was on Sunday. Had an issue. The airline has not told us what that issue was they've not been specific about was in an engine issue wasn't an. Instrumentation issue all they will say is that they fix that it was resolved this technical issue before the flight. On Monday but they've given us no information what we are hearing from Indonesians that their spending a lot of time behind closed doors with Boeing. That to me suggests that there has may be possibly been some data. That Boeing knows they're sharing with the Indonesian authorities the airline I'm sure is in there as well the NTSB. Has been invited to take part in this investigation which is a big deal to. Because. There have been issues between Indonesians and the Americans in the past when it comes to aviation safety. So NTSB is there Boeing is they're GE is there as well. All parties to this investigations so I would think. In the coming days depending on how long it takes them to read out this flight data recorder will have some sense on a theory. The question is wasn't a technical problem that took the plane down on its own. But technical problem that the pilots did not. Deal was correctly. The contributed to it and took the plane down. Or just pure pilot error if you rule out terrorism those are kind of three areas that you look at this point we aren't David Curley for us we appreciate the announces David thank you.

So here I was in Florida, attending my first Trump rally in two years.\n\nAs I stood and waited in the infamous press pen, a woman in the crowd smiled at me. As I walked toward her the smile disappeared.\n\n\u201cAre you phony media?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cDo you consider ABC phony?\u201d I responded. She nodded. We started talking.

The president\u2019s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, is the face of the campaign. Attendees watched videos of her talking about how small businesses are thriving under the current administration.\n\nDuring the president's 2016 campaign I kept track of the new signs I would see supporters hold up. An always familiar one was \"Build the Wall.\"\n\nNow, the sign has evolved to \"Finish the Wall.\"\n\nThursday's rally was similar yet different from the ones in New Hampshire and Michigan. The energy level was greater and at times more intense. A man in a Space Force shirt tossed beach balls into the fired-up crowd. Trump's supporters seemed angrier than I can recall -- but not with the man. Everyone in that arena was anti-media, seizing on the president's \"Fake News\" words. But at least Gayle waved at me as she shouted.\n\nThe rally was intended to get Republicans fired up before the midterms but the real intention was pretty clear.

Apple, Microsoft and Facebook all came...", "ABC News\u2019 chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl interviewed President Donald Trump on Oct. 31, 2018 about the migrant caravan traveling toward the U.S. border and the midterm elections. The following is the transcript of the interview:\n\nJONATHAN KARL: Mr. President, we\u2019re six days away from the midterms. If the Democrats win \u2013- I remember you surprised a lot of people by striking a deal with Pelosi and Schumer a year ago on the budget. Can you work with them if the Democrats win the House?\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Well, we certainly try. I\u2019m looking to unify. I always like to unify. We will certainly try. They\u2019ve had a very hard time because they haven\u2019t been winning. We\u2019ll see what happens five days from now. It\u2019s going to be very exciting. It\u2019s going to be a close race. And they don\u2019t talk about the blue wave anymore. It\u2019s going to be a very close race. I think in the Senate we\u2019re looking very good. I feel very good about the Senate. And frankly I think we feel pretty good about the House. But it\u2019s a lot of people. So many races it\u2019s hard for me to get to every one of them. With the Senate, we\u2019ve gotten to just about everyone I needed to get to. And I think we\u2019re going to do very well.\n\nJONATHAN KARL: And if they get into the investigations and they get into your business dealings and your tax returns -\u2013\n\nDONALD TRUMP: I\u2019ve been an open book for so long, Jon. You know that better than anybody. I\u2019m an open book. And frankly, so many people have looked at me for so many years it\u2019s probably one of the reasons I won. I think they\u2019re going to want to get along too. If they \u2013- look on the assumption they win the House, maybe they win both, and maybe they lose both -\u2013 who knows, it\u2019s going to be close. Although I\u2019m starting to see the Senate is not looking that close. It\u2019s going to be very interesting. I think they\u2019re going to want to do things. I think they\u2019re going to get legislation passed. We need things on the border, we need things on immigration -\u2013 they know that too. If you look at education, you look at health care, they\u2019re going to want to get things done. So I have a feeling it would be different than a lot of people would believe. But maybe not.\n\nJONATHAN KARL: Okay, you\u2019re talking about 10,000, maybe 15,000, active-duty U.S. military to the border \u2013-\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Yeah.\n\nJONATHAN KARL: -- more than we have fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. More than we have fighting ISIS in Syria. You\u2019re really going to do that?\n\nDONALD TRUMP: It\u2019s very important. We have to have a wall of people \u2013- very highly trained people, terrific, dedicated patriots. That\u2019s what they are. You have caravans coming up that look a lot larger than it\u2019s reported actually. I\u2019m pretty good at estimating crowd size. And I\u2019ll tell you they look a lot bigger than people would think. So we\u2019ll find out. They had a very rough one just formed in El Salvador if you can believe it. And it was very nasty, you saw what took place. And you look at what\u2019s coming up through Honduras through Mexico. And Mexico is helping us. But these are rough people in those crowds. And Mexico suffered a lot of damage in the last skirmish.\n\nChris OMeara/AP\n\nJONATHAN KARL: But what we see is a lot of deeply impoverished people fleeing violence, many of them women and children. You\u2019re going to send 15,000 active-duty U.S. military to \u2013-\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Actually it\u2019s mostly men. Actually mostly young men. And a lot of rough people, lot of rough people, Jon. You look \u2013- and it\u2019s been well reported \u2013- it\u2019s a lot of young people, lot of young men. They are pushing the women right up to the front \u2013- not good \u2013- and the kids right up to the front. But if you take a look at the caravans \u2013- and now there\u2019s more than one. There\u2019s two or three forming. And you take a look at it and they\u2019re strong young men. And you look at the skirmish they had with the Mexican police and army and it was a nasty skirmish.\n\nJONATHAN KARL: But they\u2019re 900 miles away. The active duty military \u2013- you know the law. You\u2019re the president \u2013- they can\u2019t arrest people crossing the border \u2013-\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Well it depends, it depends.\n\nJONATHAN KARL: No, they\u2019re not allowed to --\n\nDONALD TRUMP: National emergency covers a lot of territory. They can\u2019t invade our country. You look at that it almost looks like an invasion. It\u2019s almost does look like an invasion \u2013-\n\nJONATHAN KARL: You think those caravans are an invasion?\n\nDONALD TRUMP: I do think so. When you look at some of them, when you look at some of the people in them, yeah, I think it can be considered an invasion. We can\u2019t have it. We can\u2019t have it from a cost standpoint.\n\nJONATHAN KARL: These are some of the poorest people in the world coming up here.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: They are some dangerous people. These are some rough people. I mean you look at MS-13, they come from that area. This is a very rough group of people coming up. Not in all places but this is a very rough group of people. Look what they did to the Mexican army at the border. Look at the skirmish they just had. Very bad thing for the Mexican army; that was not easy. We\u2019ll see what happens and hopefully there won\u2019t be a confrontation.\n\nJONATHAN KARL: One of the central issues is health care. You\u2019ve been saying Democrats want to take away preexisting conditions. I mean, it\u2019s your administration that\u2019s supporting a lawsuit that would allow health insurance companies \u2013-\n\nDONALD TRUMP: No, but I want to replace preexisting conditions and I\u2019ve always been there. What the Democrats are going to do is destroy our entire health care and you\u2019re not going to have any health care. You would destroy the country. You are not going to have health care. The Democrats are going to literally \u2013- you\u2019ll have to pay three times the taxes and they\u2019ll destroy health care as we know it in this country. You won\u2019t have preexisting conditions. You wont have anything.\n\nJONATHAN KARL: You don\u2019t really think Democrats want to do away with the requirement to cover preexisting conditions?\n\nDONALD TRUMP: I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to have a choice because it\u2019s going to be so bad. So expensive and the health care is going to be terrible. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to have a choice. It\u2019s going to be a very bad situation.\n\nJONATHAN KARL: And finally I remember well \u2013- you remember well in the campaign, you made a promise. You said, \u201cI will never lie to you.\u201d Can you tell me now, honestly, have you kept that promise at all times? Have you always been truthful?\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Well, I try. I do try. I think you try too. You say things about me that aren\u2019t necessarily correct. I do try, and I always want to tell the truth. When I can, I tell the truth. And sometimes it turns out to be where something happens that\u2019s different or there\u2019s a change, but I always like to be truthful.\n\nABC News\n\nJONATHAN KARL: So what happened on the birthright citizenship where you said that we\u2019re the only country on the globe \u2013-\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Well, I was told that. But I will say this, we\u2019re the country people want to come to. And what they were referring to when they gave me that information is that we\u2019re the country they want to come to. People want to come to the United States. And I sort of jokingly say it\u2019s my fault, because I have really made this country strong economically. People want to come into the U.S. now because we\u2019re doing well economically, Jon, as good as well as we\u2019ve ever done as a country. And people are flowing up and I get it. And I want them to come in, but I want them to come in legally and based on merit. We have a lot of companies that are coming in. Companies from Japan, car companies going to Michigan, going all over. Foxconn going to Wisconsin. We need workers. At 3.7 percent unemployment, which is a 50-year low, is that we need workers, Jon. And I want people to come in. I really do. I want people from the caravans to come in but they have to come in legally and through merit. We need workers.\n\nJONATHAN KARL: You took a shot at Paul Ryan --\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Well, I didn\u2019t think he should be saying what he said. And he called me right after that. We\u2019re fine. I didn\u2019t think he should be saying \u2013- I think he\u2019s wrong, OK? I think he\u2019s wrong. You know who's going to iron that out pretty quickly? The Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nJONATHAN KARL: Prediction for Tuesday?\n\nDONALD TRUMP: We\u2019re going to do great in the Senate, as you can probably see and say, and you say \u2013- but we\u2019re doing pretty well in the Senate. And I think we\u2019re doing pretty well in the House. You know what I\u2019ll say? It\u2019s going to be an interesting evening.", "bad url", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "\"I fight on because that is what you told me I had to do,\" she wrote.", "Stocks are closing sharply lower on Wall Street, pulled down by more steep losses in big technology companies.

I said then that being part of the \"bubble\" was rather like being on a high school trip. On and off buses; people shouting instructions; your time rarely your own.\n\nInterested in Royal Family? Add Royal Family as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Royal Family news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nBut this time, it was a whole new ball game. If you could enter school trips into sporting competitions, the one with the Pope would have perhaps been a regional tournament -- pretty high paced but not massively taxing. The trip with Meghan and Harry, by contrast, was Olympic in its scale and difficulty: 16 days across 4 countries, with 76 separate engagements.\n\nWe were constantly against the clock, with palace officials as referees, standing over us with whistles and timers as we raced between planes -- nearly 20 flights in total -- buses, boats and taxis, hauling our equipment as we went.\n\nGranted, the Duke and Duchess travel in some comfort, but this must have been grueling for them too -- particularly pregnant Meghan.\n\ni-Images/Polaris\n\nThe news of a baby Sussex came on the eve of the trip -- we heard the news huddled around a speakerphone in a Sydney government office. This only kicked the whole thing into overdrive, and as the days wore on and our exhaustion made us increasingly manic, the fits of laughter at the live position every night with brilliant colleagues Bruno Roeber and James Gillings only became more contagious.\n\n\"Good Morning America\" was on between midnight and 2 a.m., depending on time differences -- a bit of a killer.\n\nIt is seeing the palace relationship with the press up close that has perhaps been most interesting for me. As someone who doesn't cover the royals full time, I was consistently fascinated by those who do. It's an amusingly love-hate relationship.\n\nThe royal family needs journalists, as travelling to the other side of the planet hardly would be worth anyone's time if no one was there to document it. But they are very wary of us -- especially Harry, who's antipathy for the press following his mother's death is well documented. The tabloids were not kind to him in his 20s, and the unrelenting interest in his new wife makes him understandably guarded.\n\nAndrew Parsons/i-Images/Polaris\n\nThere were two incidents on the tour that demonstrated why they do sometimes hold us at arm's length. The first was at a market in Fiji. The visit by the Duchess was one of her first truly solo engagements, and she was there to meet women who've been helped by a U.N. project. Her interest in female empowerment and the powerful symbol of a mixed-race royal in the Commonwealth made it a popular event.\n\nBut too many people came, and within about 10 minutes of her arrival, she already was being whisked away by her aides -- to her own personal frustration, it seemed to us. The palace called it \"crowd control,\" but some among the press preferred the term \"security scare,\" and almost immediately the drama became amplified for no reason. The losers? The sweet, gentle Fijians at the market who'd waited hours to see Meghan who'd now been cast as a threat.\n\nThe second incident came on the royal charter from Tonga to Sydney. There was a plane on the runway that hadn't moved away quickly enough, and the pilot pulled up to come around again -- a perfectly routine maneuver called a \"missed approach\" -- that might have seemed dramatic but simply wasn't. Nevertheless, breathless reporting of a \"near miss\" was beamed out around the globe.\n\nIt occurred to me that these issues might be part of the reason the palace keeps journalists at a distance. I saw the pope up close more often than I did Meghan and Harry on this trip. That sounds like a punchline, but it's literally true. Perhaps the relationship between press and palace will change with time -- perhaps Meghan will be the one to bridge the gap.\n\nChris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nDespite this, the trip was successful. There are moments I will remember forever -- the thousands of Tongan children welcoming the royal convoy along the route from the airport, the moving greetings Harry and Meghan received from Maori elders in New Zealand.\n\nThe couple's obvious concern for mental health initiatives was very powerful. Watching them on Bondi beach with people discussing their problems, we saw Harry speak with -- and listen to -- every member of the group. When a small boy in Auckland told him his mother had taken her life, he made him feel special, using his own experience to lift the boy up.\n\nThe tens of thousands of young people who tuned out, positively shaking with excitement at the prospect of meeting the glamorous pair, showed why a Commonwealth in which 60 percent are younger than 30 needs its new youth ambassador and his wife not afraid to speak their minds.\n\nAbove all, this tour showed the world what Meghan and Harry will be about in their lives as working royals. Many often ask what purpose Britain's royal family serves, and I think the couple have answered that question loud and clear.\n\nCameron Spencer/Getty Images\n\nThere were big themes on this tour -- above all, conservation, youth empowerment and mental health -- something I take a particular interest in. These are issues that affect us all and should be above politics. But they often aren't. Harry and Meghan -- along with William and Kate -- are serious about tackling them. If our politicians fail us, then at least we have these powerful advocates to help lead the way.", "Stocks are closing sharply lower on Wall Street, pulled down by more steep losses in big technology companies.

It's partly due to rising interest rates since 2015 -- not a Trump policy, as he's consistently attacked the Federal Reserve for raising rates. On the back of these rate hikes, there's less \"cheap money\" available, and loan terms are moving in a direction less favorable to borrowers, extending to 72 months for some.\n\nWe've gathered some numbers to explain why it costs more, on average, to buy a new car than ever before.\n\n\u2022 $35,631: The average price for new vehicles hit a record high in 2018, up $4,000 from five years ago.

The accused shooter, Robert Bowers, 46, was indicted on multiple charges, including federal hate crimes.\n\nIrvine Mayor Don Wagner said the vandalism and the deadly shooting are tragic reminders that \"historical prejudices remain alive in evil people.\"\n\nKABC\n\n\"This morning's news of anti-Semitic vandalism against one of Irvine\u2019s synagogues, along with reports of a recent incident at Irvine Valley College, are both enraging and unacceptable,\" Wagner wrote in a statement Wednesday. \"They will not go unchallenged by the good people of Irvine. An attack on anyone in Irvine of any faith is an attack on us all.\"\n\nSurveillance footage released by the Irvine Police Department shows a hooded assailant stooping down to spray-paint the front of the building before fleeing on a bicycle. Authorities said they've increased patrols at Jewish centers in the area after the attack. Police didn't disclose any details about potential suspects.\n\nPolice said they plan to \"aggressively investigate\" the incident as a hate crime.\n\nThe anti-Semitic message was quickly painted over, according to church leaders.\n\n\"The idea of something like that happening in America and Irvine is unreal,\" Allen Berezovsky, president of Beth Jacob's board, told the Los Angeles Times. \"My family immigrated here from the Soviet Union to escape such things ... and to find it here in America, it's scary and disturbing.\"", "OAKLAND, Calif. --- Golden State Warriors guard Shaun Livingston had an MRI on his right foot that came back clear, but he missed his third straight game against the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday night, and it remains unclear when he will be able to return as he continues to deal with soreness in the foot.\n\n\"It's kind of game-by-game,\" Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said before the game. \"He had an MRI and it was clear and everything was fine, but we are going to be very careful with Shaun.

We will be very careful throughout the regular season, so if there is anything nagging, with either one of them, we will keep them on the bench.\"\n\nLivingston is averaging 5.5 points and 3.5 rebounds per game this season.", "Do voters see America as a healthy melting pot? Or is Ronald Reagan's \"shining city upon a hill\" buckling under the weight of asylum seekers and changing demographics?\n\nPresident Donald Trump is trying to frame the upcoming midterm election as a national referendum on U.S. immigration. And he's betting -- as he did two years ago in his run for the White House -- that voters in key races no longer see America as a nation of immigrants, but as one under siege.\n\nWith early voting already underway, the president has ordered thousands of active-duty troops to the border, considered executive action to bar migrants from seeking asylum and questioned the birthright citizenship of children born to undocumented parents. He also described the caravan of migrants traveling through Mexico as an \"invasion\" and alleged -- without evidence -- that the caravan is riddled with \"gang members\" and \"unknown Middle Easterners.\"\n\nLate Wednesday, Trump also pushed an unsubstantiated theory that the caravan was larger than what was being reported and that women and children were being pushed in front of the cameras.\n\n\"We have to have a wall of people,\" he told ABC Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl.\n\nWill his last-minute maneuvering work to sway voters?\n\nSome 70 percent of Americans rate the issue as highly important to them, according to an Oct. 18 ABC News/Washington Post poll. But 50 percent of voters say they trust Democrats over Republicans in handling immigration, compared to 38 percent preferring the GOP's approach.\n\nThat's a shift from 2015 before Trump dominated the political landscape, when only 37 percent of voters favored Democrats on the issue and 40 percent trusted Republicans.\n\nNicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n\nStill, Trump's laser-like focus on immigration is showing signs that it's working to galvanize his base, particularly in tight races.\n\nDemocrats who would rather be talking about health care are increasingly finding themselves having to address whether they agree with Trump that a caravan of unarmed migrants still some 900 miles from the border is a national security threat. And the fear of the migrant caravan is resonating with some voters far beyond the border states of Arizona, Texas and California.\n\n\"I do not want our borders overrun,\" Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, one of the most vulnerable Democrats running for re-election, said during an interview with FOX News on Monday. \"And I support the president's efforts to make sure they're not.\"\n\nOur military is being mobilized at the Southern Border. Many more troops coming. We will NOT let these Caravans, which are also made up of some very bad thugs and gang members, into the U.S. Our Border is sacred, must come in legally. TURN AROUND! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2018\n\nThe issue of immigration isn\u2019t entirely clear-cut for many voters though.\n\nTrump's proposal to eliminate birthright citizenship, for example -- a move that would require a change to the Constitution -- was met with skepticism from his own party. GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo of South Florida tweeted back at the president: \"You can't end it by executive order.\"\n\nSpencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nAnd in Texas, where there are an estimated 120,000 \u201cDreamers\u201d -- immigrants brought to the country as children and remain in the country illegally -- Republican Rep. John Culberson talks in more nuanced terms about immigration.\n\n\"I think it's important that they feel safe,\u201d Culberson said of young immigrants. \"If they stay out of trouble, if they stay out of gangs, if they are working, in schools, earning good grades -- they shouldn't have to worry about it.\"\n\nStill, Trump's steady drumbeat on border security has been embraced by other Republicans, including those in states hundreds of miles from the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nWin McNamee/Getty Images\n\nIn the Tennessee Senate race, for example, GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn aired ads alleging the caravan was composed of \"14,000 illegal immigrants,\" although estimates have been closer to 3,000 to 7,000. Blackburn also took a page from Trump, alleging without evidence that the group had been infiltrated with gang members and \"possibly even terrorists.\"\n\nBlackburn's opponent, Democrat Phil Bredesen, responded with ads highlighting his record on border security and suggesting that immigration judges could be sent to the border to process asylum cases outside U.S. borders so immigrants aren't released into the United States without proper documentation.\n\n\"If we follow this approach, the nation and the world will see on their television screens an orderly and effective process conducted under the rule of law,\" Bredesen wrote in a recent op-ed in the \"Tennessean.\"\n\nOther Democrats have taken a page from Trump, using emotional rhetoric on immigration to slam opponents. One favorite topic among Democrats is the Trump administration's chaotic zero-tolerance policy implemented at the border last spring, which called for the detention of every adult crossing the border illegally, even if that person was traveling with children. The policy resulted in some 2,600 children being separated from their parents and confusion afterward about how to reunite families.\n\n\"Instead of dealing with drug traffickers, with sex traffickers, they have turned their attention to babies, caging them and ripping kids away from their mother,\" said Florida gubernatorial candidate Democrat Andrew Gillum in a recent debate.\n\nSuch fiery rhetoric makes Bredesen's idea of bipartisan immigration reform seem almost impossible come 2019 -- something Trump seems to instinctively know as he doubles down on his anti-immigration rhetoric.\n\n\"Go back to your Country,\" he tweeted last week in a message that once would have seemed unfathomable to come from the White House. \"And if you want, apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing!\"", "Exit polls are surveys conducted as voters leave polling places on Election Day.\n\nInterested in Midterm Elections? Add Midterm Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Midterm Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nReaching voters at that moment helps ensure that the people surveyed actually cast ballots, avoiding uncertainty on that matter that sometimes occurs with telephone polls.\n\nCritical questions of who won and why, which are reported on election night, are answered mainly from exit-poll results.\n\nHow are exit polls conducted?\n\nInterviewers stand outside polling places in randomly selected precincts and attempt to talk to voters on their way out at specific intervals -- every third or fifth voter, for example.\n\nVoters who agree to participate in the poll fill out a short questionnaire and place it in a ballot box.\n\nInterviewers phone in results three times during the day. When a voter refuses to participate, interviewers note the gender and approximate age and race of that voter. In this way, the exit poll can be statistically corrected to make sure all voters are fairly represented in the final results.\n\nWhat sort of questions are asked in an exit poll?\n\nThe typical exit poll questionnaire asks questions that attempt to answer the following: Who the voters cast ballots for in key races; what opinions they hold about the candidates and important issues; the demographic characteristics of the voter.\n\nHere's an example of a 2018 exit poll issue question:\n\nDo you think the condition of the nation's economy is:\n\n1. Excellent\n\n2. Good\n\n3. Not so good\n\n4. Poor\n\nAre exit polls accurate?\n\nExit polls, like any other survey, are subject to sampling errors. Before news organizations report any exit poll results or make projections, they compare results to pre-election polls and the voting history in that precinct, and have statisticians and political experts carefully review the data.\n\nAfter polling places close, exit poll results are weighted using the actual vote count to make the data more accurate. Even projections that are made without any actual vote data are not based solely on the results of exit polls.\n\nHow do exit polls account for the people who vote early or by mail?\n\nIn the 2014 election, just over a third of Americans voted before Election Day, using some form of absentee or early voting.\n\nBrendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThat percentage is on track to be even higher in 2018. Capturing information about these voters is challenging, but it is critical to report accurate information about all voters.\n\nIn states with a high number of people who vote absentee or early, telephone polls are conducted to reach those voters. In some states with a lot of early in-person voters, exit polls are conducted with these voters as they leave the polling place. Data from polls of absentee and early voters are combined with the Election Day exit poll data to provide a complete portrait of all voters.\n\nWhen will exit poll results be reported?\n\nOn Election Day, there is a strict quarantine on any news coming from the early waves of exit poll data until 5 p.m. ET. By about 5:45 p.m., some initial demographic information about voter turnout will be available on ABCNews.com.\n\nWinners will not be projected until polls are closed, so announcements come on a state-by-state basis as individual state polls close. Information will be constantly updated throughout the evening on ABCNews.com and on all ABC News programs.", "The day after daughter, Tina\u2019s funeral, Lora Stewart sat in her home in Newman Lake, Washington and pulled out her cell phone to watch an archived video of her daughter dancing in the middle of the street.\n\n\"Look at this Addy!\" Stewart said laughing at the video as she handed her 8-year-old granddaughter the phone.\n\nStewart was in the kitchen preparing dinner, silently watching her granddaughter replay the video of her mother dancing over and over again.\n\nAddy couldn\u2019t help but smile at the video of her mother.\n\n\"Nana, I don\u2019t know why God would put so much pain on our tiny, little hearts,\" Addy said to Stewart as she buried her head in her chest with tears in her eyes.\n\nLast Thanksgiving, Tina Stewart, a daycare teacher and mother of two was fatally beaten by her ex-boyfriend after the two got into a domestic dispute.\n\nStewart remembers her daughter Tina as a vivacious ball of energy who touched the lives of many.\n\n\"She was my best friend.

Stewart remembers it as the \"the best Thanksgiving\" they had so far as a family, but they didn\u2019t know that was the last time they would ever see Tina again.\n\n\"Charlie what is it?\" Stewart remembers sleepily murmuring in confusion after being woken up by her son Charlie from banging on her bedroom window.\n\nCharlie couldn\u2019t look his mother in the eye and stood speechless.\n\nStewart went through a list of names pleading with her son to tell her the news he had.\n\n\"Is it Tina?\" Stewart finally asked \u2014 Charlie shook his head yes.\n\n\"My knees buckled and I went down to the floor,\" Tina told ABC News. \"It was the most painful thing he [Charlie] had to do.\"\n\nTina spent Thanksgiving with her boyfriend, Nicholas Holden\u2019s family. The two were at her Holden\u2019s father\u2019s home when the couple got into a drunken dispute.\n\nHolden confessed to authorities to punching Tina multiple times in the face and kicking her while she was on the ground.\n\nAccording to ABC's Washington affiliate, KXLY, court documents indicated Holden and Stewart got into an altercation on Thanksgiving, which later turned violent. After the physical argument, court documents say later in the night she \"died from wounds after being beaten.\"\n\nCharlie remembers feeling numb and shock when he heard the dreadful news of his sister's death from her children's father, Andrew Estes.\n\n\"I\u2019ve never lost anybody that close,\" Charlie said. \"She was the closest family member I had.\"\n\nCharlie told ABC News Holden issued an apology via Facebook after he allegedly headbutted Tina at a bar.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t get along with him,\" Charlie said admitting he should have \"noticed\" the relationship Holden had with his sister.\n\nCharlie affirmed the death of his sister has taken a great toll on Tina\u2019s children and even his own.\n\n\"They can\u2019t do anything without her, she was so good with kids,\" Charlie said. \"Shane (Tina\u2019s son) is depressed, you can see it. He doesn\u2019t want to do anything.\"\n\nTina\u2019s two children are currently in counseling to help cope with their mother\u2019s death.\n\nCourtesy Donald Estes\n\nLife after Tina\n\nSeeking justice, Stewart and her family pursued Tina\u2019s perpetrator in court. Emotions and tensions ran high during the court hearings as Charlie recalls.\n\n\"We were all in a bad state of mind,\" Charlie told ABC News. \"From the first court date on, it got worse.\"\n\nHolden took a guilty plea deal in exchange for a reduced sentence \u2014 something that the Stewarts strongly rejected. Because Holden took the plea, he was sentenced to sixteen years in prison for Tina\u2019s murder.\n\n\"They cut him a deal just because he admitted to doing it despite his dirty past,\" Charlie said. \"Justice was not served.\"\n\nStewart admits the death of Tina took a great toll on her children.\n\nAfter learning Holden would not serve a maximum sentence for his crime, Donald Estes, who considers himself an \"uncle\" to Tina, vowed to dedicate the rest of his life fighting for Tina\u2019s justice and for every \"Tina\" who shares the same story.\n\nEstes decided to advocate for bill that will require convicted domestic violence abusers to register as domestic violence offenders \u2014 a law he deems intuitive for a crime he said is often overlooked.\n\nTina\u2019s Law\n\n\"Tina\u2019s story is not an isolated incident, Estes said.\n\nEstes, the uncle of Tina\u2019s ex-boyfriend and father of her two kids, remembers Tina as the bubbly 11-year-old girl that could illuminate any room she walked into.\n\n\"She was the mother that everyone wanted to be, everyone needed to be,\" Estes said.\n\nEstes diverted his anger and anguish into political motivation, into helping draft a law that will require convicted domestic violence abusers to register as such in public clearinghouse \u2013 one similar to the database for sexual offenders.\n\nAnd he's advocated for the bill with Republican and Democratic members of the House and the Senate.\n\n\"Tina\u2019s Law\" would require convicted domestic violence perpetrators be placed on a newly-created National Domestic Violence Registry.\n\nEstes is also pushing for Congress to fund D.A.R.E, a prevention program that teaches students about the negative effects of drug abuse, to include domestic violence awareness curriculums.\n\nThe only issue standing in the way of legislation approval is the negative effect it could potentially have on victims reporting on their abusers, according to Rep. Dan Newhouse\u2019s office who has been working with Estes on the bill\u2019s progression.\n\nElizabeth Daniels, the Civil Rights Legislative Assistant for Newhouse, told Estes via email they have yet to garner any support from domestic violence prevention advocacy groups or law enforcement groups due to this issue. But, Rep. Newhouse is on board with the idea.\n\n\"Rep. Newhouse is grateful to Mr. Estes for bringing up his idea to start this important conversation on how to help victims, and Rep. Newhouse\u2019s staff has been working with stakeholders and domestic violence victims\u2019 advocacy groups on options to move forward,\" a statement provided from Newhouse's office to ABC News read. \"Working together, Congress, state governments, and advocates can make positive changes that protect victims of domestic violence and their privacy.\"\n\n\"Our opposition to domestic violence registry proposals, such as \"Tina's Law,\" is rooted in both our concerns about the negative, unintended consequences of such a registry for domestic violence, and our commitment to pursue public policy solutions to violence that are supported by best practice and available evidence,\" Tamaso Johnson, the public policy director at the Washington State Coalition Against Domestic Violence told ABC News. \"Particularly, we are concerned about the impact that a registry would have on victim privacy because publicizing an abusive partner\u2019s name would often lead to identification of that person's partner as well.\"\n\nJohnson said a registry would be an ineffective metric that may lead to a \"false sense of security\" because of low rates of reporting to law enforcement from domestic violence victims.\n\nEstes has also reached out to his state lawmakers including Republican Washington state senator Shelly Short and Republican state Rep. Brad Klippert for approval to help push the bill in the legislature for approval.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, during a 10-year period from 2006-2015, 76% of domestic violence victims reported their abusers to authorities and 48% of victims or other household members signed a criminal complaint against their perpetrators.\n\nBut Estes and Stewart\u2019s family are determined to move forward with Tina\u2019s Law.\n\n\"How many more Tinas do we have to lose?\" Estes said.\n\nCourtesy Donald Estes\n\nRemembering Tina\n\n\"I miss her every single day,\" Lora Stewart said. \"Memories come back to me and I just laugh.\"\n\nLife hasn't been easy since Tina's death, according to Stewart. Tina's children are currently in therapy and each of her loved ones try to cope with her death day by day.\n\nStewart and her family remember \"Tina the Tiny Tornando\" as the small, altruistic ball of energy who didn't take anything from anyone.\n\n\"She'd finish her shift at the daycare center she worked at, run home and make pb&j sandwiches just to give them to the homeless,\" Estes told ABC News. \"That's just who she was.\"\n\nThe Stewart's held a memorial service at Tina's grave this past July for her birthday. According to Stewart, about 300 people gathered to sing \"Amazing Grace\" and to celebrate her life with a balloon send-off over the river.\n\nCharlie's daughter turned three right before Tina's birthday celebration and said something that surprised him, but left him feeling \"warm\" and \"amazed.\"\n\n\"We're waiting for Auntie Tina,\" Charlie's daughter said in front of multiple people that day. \"She's coming.\"", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "American Airlines flight 363 was only supposed to have 86 people on board -- its 87th was hungover and asleep in the cargo hold.\n\nA hungover employee for regional carrier Piedmont Airlines fell asleep in the cargo hold of an American Airlines flight from Kansas City last week and took the one-hour ride to Chicago, Sgt.

It might be a race for the governor's mansion in Georgia but it is one the entire country is watching. In the red state of Georgia where the fish is fried and the tea is sweet the politics are as bare knuckled as it comes. This is a battle for the soul of our state, y'all. We have an opponent who is an architect of voter suppression. Reporter: An historic race in a dead heat. We are Georgia! Reporter: Partly because of Stacey Abrams, the 44-year-old democratic leader in the Georgia house. I'm Stacey Abrams and I'm running for governor. Reporter: Who if elected would become the first black female governor of any state in U.S. History. We want all of Georgia to see themselves reflect in my leadership. Yes, I will be the first black woman to be a governor in the history of the United States, but what that means is I'm opening the door for the next person and the person after that. Reporter: President trump captured the state by a little over five points, so here it seems the prize is much more than a government title. It just may be for the soul of the south, even as longstanding allegations of voter suppression swirl. The candidates themselves, polar opposites. For the Republicans, trump-backed Ryan Kemp, Georgia's current secretary of state. I got a big truck just in case I need to round up criminal illegals and take 'em home myself. Yep, I just said that. Reporter: He's unapologetically conservative, a staunch supporter of the second amendment, religious liberty legislation and stricter immigration laws. We are building a red wall right here in the state of Georgia. Reporter: Abrams is running unabashedly as a Progressive, advocating for lgbtq equality, stricter gun control and expansion of medicaid. There hasn't been a democratic governor here in more than 15 years. Yes. Reporter: But you, a black woman, Progressive, can change that? Absolutely because Georgia has changed over the past 20 years. Reporter: For her supporters, Abrams' candidacy is bigger than her. I think Georgia is ready for a Progressive Democrat. This is the birthplace of civil rights. Reporter: Abrams attracted major star power. We need to vote for Stacey Abrams. Reporter: With celebrity endorsements from John legend and will Ferrell. Even Oprah is campaigning with her on Thursday, and former president Obama joining her later this week. Her opponent has used that to his advantage. That is not Georgia values. That is values of California or New York. Reporter: You have had a lot of funding from outside sources. Are you running a state campaign or a national campaign? We are running a locally-grounded campaign that is nationally known. We have more than five time of the number of individual donors giving to us. Reporter: Ryan Kemp has gotten maybe the only endorsement he needs, from the commander in chief himself, president trump tweeting himself that Kemp will be a great governor and will campaign for him right before the election. That resonated with Ted and his daughter Gianna at a Kemp campaign event here in Jessup, Georgia. Why did you bring your daughter today? We love trump and I have listened to some of the things I heard him say, and it is along in line with my conservative values. I really think -- Reporter: Hey, how are you? Good to see you, too. His campaign declined our request for a formal interview so we caught up with him at one of his events. A conservative state, how could it be so tight when you are facing an admitted Progressive? The race right now, there's been a lot of momentum on the democratic side around the country. The Republican base was not real motivated. That changed a couple of weeks ago. Reporter: At the heart of this battle for Georgia's future, what critics say is a blatant attempt by Republicans to intimidate voters of color. Emmet bondran, a long-time civil rights lawyer, says he has watched it happen for decades. There is a history of voter suppression, not only here but nationwide. Reporter: In fact, an ap report found 53,000 voter registration applications are on hold thanks to a so-called exact match law requiring applicant's information to exactly match other government records. So a misplaced hyphen or middle initial can stall an application and a vote. As secretary of state, Kemp is the architect of that law, saying he's trying to prevent voter fraud. Reporter: You talked about voter suppression. That is a myth. That is a myth that the Democrats bring out every two years. We have a record number of people on our voting roles. Reporter: But there's this detail. The majority of those 53,000 voter applications are overwhelmingly minority voters, voters that often choose Democrats. Most of those voters can cast a ballot as long as they bring a photo id to the polls. What do you say to those who say you are trying to suppress the votes? I'm not trying to suppress. The numbers don't lie about the fact. Minority participation is up 23% in Georgia, 23%. That's what you should report and not believe this bs about voter suppression. Whether it is 5,000, 50,000 people, his job is to guarantee that every Georgian who is eligible is ready to vote. Instead he purged them. Reporter: Exact match doesn't just apply to renl stragss. There's also a signatures requirement allowing officials to toss absentee ballots and applications if a signature doesn't match the one on file. The aclu and other groups filed lawsuits claiming hundreds of absentee ballots were tossed. A judge halted the practice last week and Kemp appealed calling absentee voting a privilege and convenience. A college student was eager to cast her absentee ballot, especially as a Latina voter. It is exciting to have a stay in big decisions for the state. Reporter: Her class and work schedule wouldn't allow her to make the hour drive to fill it out in person. I made sure to fill it in correctly and send it in. Two weeks after I sent it in I got notice that it had been rejected. Votes like me are ones that scare secretary Kemp. Reporter: She was told her signatures didn't match. I wasn't given a process to, you know, fix my ballot or have it reinstated prior to the rejection. Reporter: Under the voting rights act, states which had a history of voter disenfranchisement were monitored by the federal government, but a 2013 supreme court ruling undid that requirement. You've been on this case for a long time. Do you feel like we're going backwards? I am both surprised and disappointed that we are going in the opposite direction of making it harder for people to vote. Reporter: A federal study looked at those southern states and examined five kinds of voter suppression tactics. Georgia, the study says, was the only state to have adopted all five. Mr. Kemp created an atmosphere of fear around the right to vote in the state of Georgia. Reporter: Abrams calling on her opponent to step down, but Kemp is standing firm. I took an oath of office to serve as secretary of state and that's exactly what I'm going to continue to do. I am doing the exact same thing that Democrat Cathie cox was doing when she was running for governor. Reporter: Their fate is now in the hands of voters. He believes in the same values that I do. He's conservative, believes in the second amendment, lower taxes, and just believes in the same type of conservative things that I do. Sissy Abrams represents the future of Georgia as I want to see it. It is time for women and people of color to be in power. Reporter: It is clear Georgians are eager to decide the future of their state as long as that unalienable right, the right to vote, is not taken away.

After this day of unity and togetherness, I came home and sadly turned on the news and watched as the far-left media, once again, used tragedy to sow anger and division,\" Trump said.\n\nThe crowd broke into chants of \"CNN sucks, CNN sucks.\"\n\n\"Sadly, they took a small group of protesters, far away from where we were, because we could not have been treated better, the first lady and myself were representing the presidency, and they did everything in their power to try and play it up and push people apart -- that's what's happening, they're pushing people apart,\" Trump said. \"It was fake and it was make believe ... and when we talk about division this is a big part of the division right there.\"\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"The left-wing media doesn't want to solve problems, they want to stoke resentment,\" Trump said. \"It has to stop.\"\n\nTrump decried the \"crazy policy\" of birthright citizenship and said \"we will finally end\" it.\n\n\"Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants are made automatic citizens every year because of this crazy policy,\" Trump said. \"Under this policy, anyone who breaks into our country and has a child the very next moment that child will be made a citizen for life.\"\n\n\"This policy has even created an entire industry of birth tourism -- big business -- where pregnant mothers travel to America to make their children instant American citizens,\" Trump said, supported by the crowd's boos.\n\nAs the president kicked off his final, six-day, 11-rally sprint to Election Day with his rally in Florida Wednesday night, he also was anxious to talk about the stakes of the election and turn the conversation back to immigration.\n\nTrump called next Tuesday's midterms \"the most important elections of our lives,\" but added a caveat: \"Though I will say, not as important as 2016.\"\n\nHe warned of the approaching migrant caravan currently making its way up through Mexico, warning \"they\u2019ve got a lot of rough people in those caravans -- they aren't angels.\"\n\nThe president then criticized the so-called policy of \"catch and release,\" suggesting he will catch but not release the coming migrants.\n\n\"It's called catch, but we take the word 'release' out,\" Trump said. \"We're not going to release any more. We have no choice.\"\n\nAt one point the president inquired about who in the crowd had voted early. After loud cheers, the president joked: \"Then what the hell am I doing here tonight? What am I doing?\u201d\n\n\"It's like 100 percent of the people in this room voted,\" the president remarked.", "The European Commission says Italy's budget plans are in serious breach of the rules underpinning the euro single currency and that the country should...", "The son and daughter of a woman who mysteriously died aboard a cruise ship speak out exclusively to ABC News.", "President Donald Trump said that the increased military presence on the border is going to help stop what he called the \"invasion\" that is coming in the migrant caravan and said that he \"always likes to be truthful.\"\n\n\"We have to have a wall of people,\" Trump said, shortly after it was announced that he plans to send 10,000 to 15,000 troops to the border.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with ABC Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl, Trump also said that he strives to tell the truth.\n\n\"Well, I try. I do try ... and I always want to tell the truth. When I can, I tell the truth. And sometimes it turns out to be where something happens that\u2019s different or there\u2019s a change, but I always like to be truthful,\" Trump said.\n\nABC News\n\nOne of the issues he has with the reporting of the migrant caravan is that he believes the crowd estimates are wrong, based off his own estimates.\n\n\"You have caravans coming up that look a lot larger than it\u2019s reported actually. I\u2019m pretty good at estimating crowd size. And I\u2019ll tell you they look a lot bigger than people would think,\" Trump said.\n\n\"But what we see is a lot of deeply impoverished people fleeing violence, many of them women and children,\" Karl followed up.\n\nTrump responded with a claim that the caravan is made up of \"mostly young men\" and that the women and children pictured in the crowd are being purposefully posed for the cameras.\n\n\"It\u2019s a lot of young people, lot of young men -- they are pushing the women right up to the front -- not good -- and the kids right up to the front,\" Trump said.\n\nABC News\n\nTrump hinted that while the military is not allowed to actively make arrests -- and will instead aid border patrol officers on the ground -- circumstances may allow for their scope to widen.\n\nAfter being asked about what role the active duty military will play, Trump said, \"Well it depends, it depends.\"\n\nTrump repeatedly referred to the caravan, which is weeks from arriving at the U.S. border, as an \"invasion.\"\n\n\"National emergency covers a lot of territory. They can\u2019t invade our country. You look at that it almost looks like an invasion. It\u2019s almost does look like an invasion,\" he said.\n\n\"You think those caravans are an invasion?\" Karl asked.\n\n\"I do think so,\" Trump replied. \"When you look at some of them, when you look at some of the people in them, yeah, I think it can be considered an invasion. We can\u2019t have it.\"\n\nTrump also answered to criticism over his desire to eliminate birthright citizenship in the country. Part of Trump's argument for eliminating birthright citizenship was that the U.S. was the only country where it existed. In reality, almost all of North America, South America and Central America also follow the same course of action, including Argentina, Canada and Mexico, according to the CIA's World Factbook.\n\nWhen asked about the comment, Trump responded, \"Well I was told that.\"\n\nJose Cabezas/Reuters\n\nOptimistic about the midterms\n\nTrump spoke to Karl before a rally in Florida where he campaigned for Gov. Rick Scott, who is running for Senate against Democrat Bill Nelson. The president seemed optimistic about Republicans' chances come Tuesday.\n\n\"We\u2019re going to do great in the Senate, as you can probably see ... And I think we\u2019re doing pretty well in the House. You know what I\u2019ll say, it\u2019s going to be an interesting evening,\" he said.\n\nTrump said that Democrats have \"had a very hard time because they haven't been winning.\"\n\n\"We\u2019ll see what happens five days from now. It\u2019s going to be very exciting. It\u2019s going to be a close race. And they don\u2019t talk about the 'blue wave' anymore. It\u2019s going to be a very close race. I think in the Senate we\u2019re looking very good,\" Trump said. \"I feel very good about the Senate. And frankly I think we feel pretty good about the House. But it\u2019s a lot of people -- so many races it\u2019s hard for me to get to every one of them. With the Senate, we\u2019ve gotten to just about everyone I needed to get to. And I think we\u2019re going to do very well.\"\n\nSusan Walsh/AP\n\nHealth care is a central issue at play in races across the country, and Trump reiterated recent claims that Democrats want to take away coverage for pre-existing conditions. Karl pointed out that the Trump administration has filed a lawsuit attempting to do away with pre-existing condition protections altogether.\n\n\"I want to replace pre-existing conditions and I\u2019ve always been there. What the Democrats are going to do is destroy our entire health care and you\u2019re not going to have any health care. You would destroy the country. You are not going to have health care,\" he said. \"The Democrats are going to literally -- you\u2019ll have to pay three times the taxes and they\u2019ll destroy health care as we know it in this country. You won\u2019t have pre-existing conditions. You wont have anything.\"\n\n\"You don\u2019t really think Democrats want to do away with the requirement to cover pre-existing conditions?\" Karl asked.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to have a choice because it\u2019s going to be so bad, so expensive and the health care is going to be terrible,\" the president replied. \"I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to have a choice. It\u2019s going to be a very bad situation.\"\n\nPresident Trump has a long and established record of making exaggerations and false claims, with the Washington Post documenting that the president has made more than 5,000 false or misleading claims over the course of his presidency.", "bad url", "In a Republican county in a Republican state, Coral Stavros, is waiting for Stacey Abrams.\n\n\"Stacey Abrams represents the future of Georgia as I want to see it,\" the 55-year-old said with a glint in her eye.\n\nAlyssa Pointer/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP\n\nDonning a \"Make Racism Wrong Again\" hat, the regional manager \"for a food brand you've probably never heard of\", said that Georgia -- despite its conservative leanings -- is ready for a Democrat like Abrams, who's running for governor.\n\n\"I absolutely think Georgia is ready for a progressive Democrat. I mean this is the birthplace of civil rights...We're the capital of the south and we are the leaders of new thought in the south,\" Stavros said. \"And it's time.\"\n\nWatch the full story on \"Nightline\" tonight at 12:35 a.m. ET\n\nThe Candidates\n\nGeorgia's gubernatorial race is one of the most closely-watched races in the nation. On one side there is Abrams, the Democratic leader in the Georgia House Representatives. Her candidacy is, in large part, the reason why this race has attracted so much national attention. Were she to win, she would be the first African-American female governor in U.S. history.\n\nThere is also the Trump-backed Brian Kemp. He currently serves as the Secretary of State for Georgia, the office responsible for running the state\u2019s elections.\n\nCurtis Compton/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP\n\nAnd therein lies the other reason for all the publicity; in recent weeks, his office has been swamped with allegations of rampant voter suppression. Multiple organizations including the ACLU and the NAACP have accused Kemp's office of using tactics that disenfranchise minorities from voting.\n\nHe has vehemently denied any impropriety, insisting that his office is simply enforcing laws that are on the books in their larger goal to prevent voter fraud.\n\nAs ABC News traveled around Georgia, we spoke with both candidates about their plans and the controversies surrounding this race.\n\nKemp, 55, has made a name for himself as a down-home conservative who doesn't care about what anyone thinks.\n\nOne of his controversial campaign ads from the primary depicts Kemp, holding a shotgun, and later a chainsaw, proudly making statements like, \" I own guns, and no one\u2019s taking \u2019em away,\" and \"I got a big truck, just in case I need to round up criminal illegals and take \u2019em home myself.\"\n\n\"Yep, I just said that. I\u2019m Brian Kemp. If you want a politically incorrect conservative, that\u2019s me.\u201d\n\nThat message resonates with many in his home state. At a Kemp campaign rally in Jesup, Ted Badami, a retired federal law enforcement agent, was on hand with his daughter Gianna.\n\nABC News' Deborah Roberts asked him what he thought of Kemp's message.\n\n\"It's right along the lines of conservative values,\" Badami said. \"I'm originally from Michigan I was born in Ohio and raised in Michigan. Conservative communities I think we have a lot in common.\" he said. \"Immigration's important, the values. I like the fact he's talking about paying teachers more and supporting law enforcement.\"\n\nStatistically, the two are in an almost dead heat -- a surprising phenomenon for a reliably conservative state. The last time Georgia elected a Democrat was more than 20 years ago.\n\nABC News requested a formal interview with Kemp but his campaign declined. Still, Roberts was able to ask the Secretary about the race after a campaign stop in Ludowici.\n\n\"It\u2019s been a lot of momentum on the Democratic side all around the country from their base,\" Kemp said. \"I think the reason it was so tight early on because the Republican base was not real motivated. That\u2019s changed a couple of weeks ago.\"\n\nPresident Trump endorsed Kemp early in the race and has been, of late, tweeting on his behalf.\n\nBrian Kemp will be a GREAT Governor of Georgia. Stacey Abrams will destroy the State. Sooooo important, get out and VOTE for Brian! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 24, 2018\n\nTrump will also campaign for Kemp on Sunday, two days before the election.\n\nMeanwhile, Abrams has garnered the support of big names in Hollywood: John Legend has hosted fundraisers; Will Ferrell knocked on doors in Georgia for her, and musician Common has campaigned for her. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker have campaigned for her as well, and former President Barack Obama will join her at a campaign rally on Friday.\n\nKemp has used that to his advantage -- attacking Abrams for receiving 65 percent of her donations from out of the state. Kemp calls her views and values out of touch with \"real Georgians.\"\n\nAbrams, in an interview with Roberts aboard her campaign bus, said she doesn't mind being characterized as a nationally-known campaign figure.\n\n\"We have received funding from across the state, but [in terms of] individual donors, we have more than five times the number of individual donors [as Kemp] from the state of Georgia giving to us,\" she said.\n\n\"I believe that we have to run a local campaign that is nationally-known because Georgia wants to be a leading state.\"\n\nKemp's has underscored his claims that Abrams is an extremist with a bit of sound caught on tape in which Abrams can be heard saying that the blue wave sweeping the country \"is comprised of those who are documented and undocumented.\"\n\nKemp has said that Abrams wants to see \"illegals voting.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Abrams told Roberts. \"I know that the only people who are allowed to vote are eligible citizens.\"\n\nAbrams, 44, who writes mystery novels in her spare time, is running an unabashedly progressive campaign. She's an ally for LGBTQ equality, a proponent of stricter gun control and believes in expanding Medicaid.\n\nRoberts asked Abrams if she thinks that she can break the Republican winning streak in Georgia.\n\n\"Absolutely. Because Georgia has changed over the last 20 years. Demographically we are a much more diverse state. But also the issues that I'm talking about resonating across ideologies,\" Abrams responded.\n\nBut at the heart of this battle for Georgia's future lies bitter talk about Georgia's past. The state -- and particularly Kemp's office -- has come under fire for what critics say is a blatant attempt by Republicans to intimidate voters of color.\n\nAtlanta-based attorney Emmet J. Bondurant said he has watched it happen for decades.\n\n\"Georgia's no different the rest of the nation,\" Bondurant said. \"It has become progressively more polarized, more vitriolic. The electoral process has become much more poisonous than in the past. And we are no exception to that,\" he said.\n\nThe examples are plentiful. An Associated Press report found that 53,000 voter registration applications are on hold, thanks to a so-called \"Exact Match\" law.\n\nIt requires voter information to exactly match other government records. A misplaced hyphen or a middle initial, instead of the full name, can stall an application. Critics have called the law overly restrictive.\n\nWhile most of these voters should still be able to vote on Election Day if they provide a photo ID, experts said that their \u201cpending\u201d registration status means their votes could be challenged and their registrations might be deleted.\n\nRoberts asked Kemp about those allegations.\n\n\"Well that is a myth Democrats bring out every two years,\" he said. \"We have a record number of people on our voting rolls, we have a record number of people voting in the presidential election. I created, through the legislature, and implemented online voter registration. \"\n\nBut, out of those 53,000 pending voter applications, 80 percent are African-American, Latino or Asian-American -- voting blocs that, while not monolithic, tend to swing Democrat.\n\nWhen asked about that, Kemp brought up the voter registration group that Abrams founded, The New Georgia Project. The group's goal was to register minority voters.\n\nThe State Elections Board last year referred 53 allegedly forged voter applications to the Georgia Attorney General\u2019s Office, out of 87,000 that were submitted in 2014.\n\nThe Attorney General eventually found no wrongdoing by the group.\n\nYet Kemp said minorities are among those targeted \"because that's who her group signed up.\"\n\n\"There is no purging,\" he added. \"We are following federal laws to keep our voting rolls clean. That word, purging, is outrageous.\"\n\nExact match requirements don't just apply to registrations. There's also a signature match requirement in Georgia that prompted local election officials to toss absentee ballots and applications if the officials, who are not trained in handwriting analysis, determine any signature doesn't match others on file.\n\nLast week, a federal judge temporarily blocked Georgia election officials\u2019 practice of discarding absentee ballots because of mismatched signatures and ordered officials to provide provisional ballots to these voters.\n\nKemp has appealed that ruling, calling absentee voting a \u201cprivilege and a convenience,\u201d and not a Constitutional right.\n\nJohn Bazemore-Pool/Getty\n\n\"We're Going Backwards\"\n\nLana Goitia, a 21-year-old student at the University of North Georgia, said she applied for an absentee ballot, eager to vote in her first midterm election.\n\n\"It's pretty exciting to have the opportunity to have a say in some big decisions for a state and for our governorship, so it's very important and exciting for me,\" she said.\n\nHer home polling location is in Loganville, about an hour's drive from her campus. Since she works and takes classes, she knew she wouldn't be able to make it there on election day and filed for an absentee ballot.\n\n\"I've made sure to fill it out correctly and then sent it in,\" she recalled. About two weeks later, she said, \"I got notice that it had been rejected.\"\n\nShe said she was told that her signature looked different than the one on voter registration application from four years ago.\n\n\"I received notice that it had been rejected, but before the rejection, I received no notice that, 'hey look these aren't matching up,'\" she said. \"I wasn't given a process to, you know, fix my ballot or have it reinstated prior to the rejection.\"\n\nGoitia said that, as a young Hispanic woman, she feels her ballot was targeted.\n\n\"I think votes like mine are ones that scare Secretary Kemp,\" she said. \"I think those are votes that stand to be, you know, challenged -- that stand to have barriers placed in front of them because I think the young people, and particularly in minority groups, are groups that he is scared of.\"\n\nCivil rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), have filed lawsuits that claim hundreds of absentee ballots and applications were tossed. A judge halted that practice last week and Kemp appealed, calling absentee voting \"a privilege and convenience.\"\n\nKemp's office said that he's trying to protect the integrity of the polls and prevent voter fraud. According to experts, though, voter fraud in Georgia is almost non-existent. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, found that Georgia officials have pursued 19 election fraud cases in the past two decades. Seven of those cases resulted in a criminal conviction.\n\nJoshua L. Jones/Athens Banner-Herald via AP\n\nUnder the Voting Rights Act of 1965, certain states that had histories of voter disenfranchisement were required to report any changes in voting access to the federal government. A landmark Supreme Court ruling in 2012, Shelby County v Holder undid those requirements. Consequently, some experts said, voter suppression is on the rise.v\n\nBondurant, who's been arguing civil rights cases since the 1960s, sees this as a reason for concern.\n\n\"I am both surprised and disappointed that 50 years after the Voting Rights Act was enacted that we're going in the opposite direction of making it harder for people to vote,\" he said.\n\nA study conducted by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights examined five common voter suppression tactics. The study determined that voter identification laws, proof of citizenship requirements, purges, cuts in early voting, and polling place closures. Georgia is the only state once under federal oversight to have adopted all five.\n\nAbrams has called for Kemp to step down from his position as Secretary of State, as has former president and Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter.\n\n\"I will say that as the ACLU of Georgia we would prefer not to be suing one of the candidates for governor when we have to sue the secretary of state over how the election is being administered,\" said Andrea Young, Executive Director of the ACLU of Georgia.\n\nBut Kemp has resisted, saying that he's doing just as other elected officials have done, including Democrat Cathy Cox who remained as Georgia's Secretary of State when she was running for governor.\n\nBut, despite all the allegations, early voting numbers have already been higher in Georgia than this time last cycle, with lines at some polling places lasting up to three hours.\n\nIn Jesup, Badami said he sees himself in Kemp.\n\n\"I think we have a lot in common,\" he said. \"We're talking about conservative values. Immigration's important...I like the fact he's talking about paying teachers more and supporting law enforcement.\"\n\nIn Dooley County, Michael, who declined to give his last name, said he sees himself in Kemp.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s conservative, he believes in the second amendment, lower taxes and just believes in the same type of conservative values I do,\u201d he said. And when asked if those values were at risk if Abrams was elected, he replied, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nIn Newnan, Stavros is optimistic.\n\n\"My hope for Georgia is that we are seen as a progressive state that is promoting equality. I don't see what could possibly be wrong with progress and equality.\n\n\"Democracy dies in darkness and it requires participation,\" she said. \"And I would never really live with myself if I didn't participate in trying to save it.\"\n\nABC News' Lauren Pearle contributed to this report.\n\nThis report was featured in the Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018, episode of ABC News' Daily news podcast, \"Start Here.\"\n\n\"Start Here\" is the flagship daily news podcast from ABC News -- a straightforward look at the day's top stories in 20 minutes.

He also stressed that the drug would only be used in medically supervised health care settings.\n\nBut with an average of 115 Americans dying every day from an opioid overdose, opponents say enough is enough.\n\n\u201cIt is certain that Dsuvia will worsen the opioid epidemic and kill people needlessly,\u201d said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, founder and senior advisor of the nonprofit Public Citizen\u2019s Health Research Group, in a press release.\n\nIf you haven't heard of Dsuvia before, here are some things you should know.\n\nWhat is Dsuvia?\n\nDsuvia is a tablet form of sufentanil that\u2019s meant to dissolve under the tongue. It's five to 10 times stronger than fentanyl, an opioid drug already on that market, and 500 to 1000 times more powerful than morphine. Fentanyl is also produced illicitly and is associated with many overdose deaths, often by those who are unaware that the opioids they're using contain fentanyl.\n\nDsuvia is intended for use with patients experiencing acute pain only in medically supervised settings, according to its makers.\n\nWhy was this drug developed?\n\nThe drug was developed to fulfill an unmet need, according to Dr. Pamela Palmer, anesthesiologist and chief medical officer at AcelRx, the maker of the drug.\n\n\u201cFor acute pain management in a hospital, there hasn\u2019t been a new opioid developed in many, many years,\u201d she told ABC News. Right now, if you broke your femur and went into an emergency room, you would either have to be stuck with a needle or they would just give you an oral pill that you would swallow and kind of wait for it to kick in, which could take up to an hour.\u201d\n\nPalmer said there weren\u2019t any opioids available that could dissolve under the tongue for patients who aren\u2019t specifically diagnosed with cancer, experiencing pain, and tolerant to other opioids. \u201cDsuvia is indicated for\u2026 the management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate,\u201d she said.\n\nPalmer also said that Dsuvia could help health care providers prevent dosing errors that can occur when administering liquid formulations of opioid medications.\n\nWhat about concerns of abusing Dsuvia?\n\nIn addition to making the drug available only in medically supervised settings, AcelRx has other plans for preventing abuse of the drug, Palmer said.\n\n\u201cWe have much stricter audits and monitoring and controls where we will have oversight from our manufacturers, from our distributors, wholesalers, all the way to the medically supervised setting,\u201d she said.\n\nThe company also has a contract with Denver Health, which runs the RADARS system \u2014 a group of programs that are used to monitor prescription drug abuse, misuse and diversion.\n\nDr. Raeford Brown, chair of the FDA advisory committee on analgesics and anesthetic drug products, was not present to vote on Oct. 12, when the committee voted in favor of the FDA approving the drug \u2014 a step that comes before the FDA makes an official decision.\n\nHowever, he told ABC News that he has significant concerns about the drug, and said in the Public Citizen press release that he was \u201cvery disappointed by the decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem reasonable to place another potent opioid on the market at this time, especially when we\u2019re currently still writing 200 million prescriptions for opioids a year,\u201d Brown told ABC News. \u201cThe need to put a drug like this on the market is not demonstrated. The ability to manage that drug once it gets past the FDA is not demonstrated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know from looking at other potent opioids that have been put on the market in the last four years that once these drugs get past the FDA, there\u2019s very little, if any, control over them, no matter what the sponsor says prior to the time they come on the market,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a press release, Democratic Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts also expressed concerns about Dsuvia\u2019s potential impact on the opioid epidemic. Massachusetts has some of the highest opioid overdose rates in the U.S., according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\u201cAn opioid that is a thousand times more powerful than morphine is a thousand times more likely to be abused and a thousand times more likely to kill,\u201d Markey said. \u201cEven in the midst of the worst drug crisis our nation has ever seen, the FDA once again is going out of its way to approve a new supercharged painkiller that would only worsen the opioid epidemic. It makes no sense to approve an opioid painkiller that has no benefits over similar medications and against the advice of experts.\u201d\n\nHe added: \"I call on the FDA to reject the vote of the advisory committee and stop the approval of this dangerously unnecessary opioid medication.\"\n\nDr. Anna Jackson is a psychiatry resident at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a member of ABC News' Med Unit."]
