Equipment and shipping containers carry Chinese labels.\n\nI ask the EPS official running the project, Zeljko Lazovic, what he feels about such a large and important venture being in the hands of Chinese engineers and workers.\n\n\"In the next few months a lot of Chinese will come here and this will be a big challenge,\" he says.\n\n\"With Chinese workers and Serbian workers, at the beginning we had some cultural problems but we have overcome them and there is now very good cooperation.\"\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Efforts to tackle pollution in Chinese cities such as Beijing have pushed Chinese power companies to look overseas\n\nWhen asked about the environmental cost of the new project, Mr Lazovic insisted it would meet all the EU's standards on pollution by dust, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur.\n\nHowever, the new unit will not be fitted with any carbon capture technology so it will fit into a pattern of Chinese-backed projects that will add to carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.\n\n'Locked into high emissions'\n\nChristine Shearer is an analyst with the group CoalSwarm, which tracks coal developments, and she is scathing about the implications.\n\n\"These projects are not compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C or 2C,\" she said, referring to the two targets of the Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\nShe says that Chinese financial institutions are filling a gap left by Western banks and agencies deciding to limit their involvement in coal.\n\n\"These projects, if completed, will lock the countries into high carbon-emitting infrastructure and volatile coal imports precisely at a time when prices for clean energy are starting to fall below that of coal power.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sir David Attenborough: Climate change is proceeding \"so much faster\" than the last Ice Age did\n\nWe tried to contact the Export-Import Bank of China, which is providing the loan, and the China Machinery Engineering Corporation, which is leading the construction, but did not hear back.\n\nFor the Serbian power company, EPS, the attraction of a local supply of coal has combined with a cheap Chinese loan and the prospects of valuable exports of electricity.\n\nRespiratory diseases\n\nAbout 3,500 jobs depend on the Kostolac complex but some local people have become increasingly outspoken about the pollution in the area.\n\nMomir Savic showed me how the conveyor belts carrying coal run close to the villages and he fears a further expansion of the operation.\n\n\"The quality of our air and water is very poor. We cannot grow fruit and vegetables. There is also a lot of noise. All this affects the health of people living here, many of whom have respiratory diseases,\" he said.\n\nImage caption Residents near the Chinese-supported plant complain of poor air quality\n\nEPS says it is spending hundreds of millions of euros on environmental protection but its track record clearly does not inspire trust.\n\nPera Markovic, a lawyer with Cekor, an environmental group, is critical of the company's failure to limit pollution in the local area.\n\nBut he concedes that Serbia is heavily dependent on coal for its power.\n\nFor how long? \"Decades,\" Mr Markovic says.\n\nThat's likely to be the same in many other countries too, whatever climate scientists say is needed."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "The Papers: Front pages divided on Brexit deal", "description": "Should the UK 'get on with it' or does the deal mark a 'Black Friday'?

But Saudi Arabia maintains it was a \"rogue operation\".\n\n\"They didn't conclude,\" Mr Trump said when asked about the CIA's reported evaluation by reporters in Florida.\n\nHis comments on Thursday came as the Saudi crown prince began a regional tour of the Middle East, starting with the United Arab Emirates - his first official trip abroad since Khashoggi was killed.\n\nThe Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed, tweeted to say the UAE \"will always be a loving and supportive home for our brothers in Saudi Arabia\".\n\nSkip Twitter post by @MohamedBinZayed Delighted to welcome our state guest, brother Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

This wariness has become more pronounced since the mistakes made in the run-up to the Iraq invasion of 2003.\n\nSeparately, the Hurriyet newspaper reported on Thursday that Ms Haspel told Turkish officials last month that the CIA had a recording in which the crown prince gave instructions to \"silence\" the Saudi writer as soon as possible.\n\nWhen asked about the claims by reporters, Mr Trump said: \"I don't want to talk about it. You'll have to ask them.\"\n\nWhat have the Saudis said?\n\nSaudi Arabia says claims that the crown prince may have ordered the Khashoggi killing are false and maintains that he knew nothing about it.\n\nThe Gulf kingdom's public prosecutor has said Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate as a result of a \"rogue operation\" on the orders of an intelligence officer.\n\nKhashoggi was given a lethal injection after a struggle. His body was then dismembered inside the consulate in Istanbul and the body parts were handed over to a local \"collaborator\" outside the grounds, the prosecutor said.\n\nHe said investigations had \"revealed that the person who ordered the killing was the head of the negotiations team\", but did not identify any of the 11 people charged with the murder.\n\nWho was Jamal Khashoggi?\n\nAs a prominent journalist, he covered major stories including the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the rise of Osama Bin Laden for various Saudi news organisations.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Jamal Khashoggi had gone to Istanbul to obtain a marriage document\n\nFor decades he was close to the Saudi royal family and also served as an adviser to the government.\n\nBut he fell out of favour and went into self-imposed exile in the US last year. From there, he wrote a monthly column in the Washington Post in which he criticised the policies of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nIn his first column for the newspaper, Khashoggi said he feared being arrested in an apparent crackdown on dissent overseen by the prince since.\n\nIn his last column, he criticised Saudi involvement in the Yemen conflict."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Women's World T20: Australia beat West Indies to reach final", "description": "Australia move into the final of the Women's World T20 as they comfortably beat hosts West Indies by 71 runs.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/46309368", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/1626F/production/_104453709_australia_wicket.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T22:49:34Z", "content": "Australia captain Meg Lanning's score of 31 was her best of the tournament so far ICC Women's World Twenty20, Australia 142-5 (20 overs): Healy 46, Lanning 31, Haynes 25no West Indies 71 (17.2 overs): Perry 2-2, Gardner 2-15, Kimmince 2-17 Australia won by 71\u2026 [+1568 chars]", "fulltext": "Media playback is not supported on this device Women's World Twenty20 highlights: Australia thrash West Indies\n\nICC Women's World Twenty20 semi-final, Antigua Australia 142-5 (20 overs): Healy 46, Lanning 31, Haynes 25no West Indies 71 (17.2 overs): Perry 2-2, Gardner 2-15, Kimmince 2-17 Australia won by 71 runs Scorecard\n\nAustralia moved into the final of the Women's World T20 as they comfortably beat hosts West Indies by 71 runs.\n\nAlyssa Healy top scored for Australia with 46 off 38 balls, captain Meg Lanning made 31 and Rachael Haynes hit a rapid 25 as they reached 142-5.\n\nBut the West Indies lost two wickets inside the opening three overs and were bowled out for 71 in 17.2 overs.\n\nAustralia will now face England in the final after they comfortably beat India in the second semi-final.\n\nThe first semi-final was a repeat of the 2016 final, which West Indies won by eight wickets to win the competition for the first time.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device World T20: Best bits as England & Australia make the final\n\nThey had won all four of their group games in 2018 and made a bright start in the semi-final, restricting Australia to 71-2 after 12 overs on a slow pitch, despite Healy's fine innings - her fourth score of more than 35 in four innings.\n\nDeandra Dottin dismissed Lanning but Dottin's next over went for 18 as Haynes' 15-ball innings helped Australia to a competitive total after being put in to bat first by the hosts.\n\nWest Indies had successfully chased down England's 115-8 in their final group game, but they had Hayley Matthews brilliantly run out by Healy in the second over, with Dottin bowled by Ellyse Perry in the third.\n\nThe hosts then fell to 27-4 and never looked like reaching their target, with two wickets apiece for Perry, Delissa Kimmince and Ashleigh Gardner.\n\nA number of West Indies players were in tears late on as Australia cruised to victory.\n\nAustralia are aiming to win the tournament for a fourth time, after successes in 2010, 2012 and 2014.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device 'A fantastic catch' - Diving Cooper catch removes Villani\n\n'A really awesome win' - what they said\n\nAustralia's Alyssa Healy: \"They left a bit of fluffyness on the top of the pitch.

Woods told him to double it to $200,000 (\u00a3155,200).\n\nIf, indeed, that money is coming out of the pockets of the players - or sponsors - the rest of the pot is being paid for by the viewers.\n\nMickelson says the watching public are being given the ability to play \"fantasy golf\" and believes allowing them to take part in live, real-time betting will only pique interest in the sport.\n\nPGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan admitted in April that \"there are commercial opportunities\" for the professional body in the expansion of legalised sports betting in the United States.\n\nFifteen years too late?\n\nWith 19 majors between them and two decades apiece at the top, Woods and Mickelson are two of the most recognisable golfers on the planet.\n\nBattles for the game's biggest prizes and the number one ranking, plus a frostiness in their relationship which has since thawed, created an enduring rivalry between the pair.\n\nIn recent years their powers have waned, 42-year-old Woods not adding to his 14 majors since 2008 after personal and injury problems and 48-year-old Mickelson not lifting one in the past five years.\n\nHowever, both have shown glimpses of recapturing their form by claiming PGA Tour victories this year and, in Tiger's case, threatening at the Open Championship and US PGA Championship.\n\nNevertheless, it does not seem to have captured the imagination of the younger generation of leading players.\n\n\"Look, if they had done it 15 years ago it would have been great,\" Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy said. \"But nowadays, it has missed the mark a little bit.\"\n\nWorld number four Justin Thomas, who is an American Ryder Cup team-mate of Woods and Mickelson, indicated last month he would not be paying the $19.99 subscription fee to watch.\n\n\"Love TW and Phil to death, but there's a zero percent chance I order that,\" Thomas tweeted. \"I'll be watching football!\"\n\nSpain's Jon Rahm, ranked eighth, said he felt the match is \"10 years too late\".\n\n\"Maybe when they were both in their prime it would have been extremely amazing,\" he said.\n\nEngland's Eddie Pepperell, the world number 38, described the match as \"putrid attempt at attention\" which will \"be futile for everyone\".\n\nEnglish golfer Eddie Pepperell voiced his concerns in a Tweet containing an explicit word...\n\nAnyone in favour of exhibition golf?\n\nWhile there have been plenty of dissenting voices, few high-profile players have publicly backed the event.\n\nWhen the Mickelson versus Woods match was confirmed earlier this year, former Masters winner Adam Scott said he was open to more exhibition golf being played and welcomed the prospect of a 18-hole match against fellow Australian Jason Day.\n\n\"I think it'd all be in good fun,\" Scott said. \"I'd like to think there is room for exhibition golf; it's something the tour down there should maybe look at trying to do.\"\n\nOne suspects any future plans will depend on the number of people who engage with - and most importantly, spend money on - Friday's match between Mickelson and Woods."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "European Curling Championships: Scotland's men beat Italy to book final with Sweden", "description": "Scotland's men will meet Sweden in the final of the European Curling Championship after beating Italy in an extra end in Tallinn.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/winter-sports/46305068", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/2337/production/_104451090_brucemouat-perthshirepictureagency-graemehart.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T20:10:55Z", "content": "Skip Bruce Mouat is aiming to add European gold to World bronze Scotland's men will go for gold at the European Curling Championships after beating Italy 9-6 in the semi-final.

but millions of years ago there were many more types of giant herbivore.\n\nWhy so many types vanished is not known, but many experts have blamed our tool-using, meat-eating ancestors.\n\nNow, researchers say the mammal decline began long before humans appeared.\n\nWriting in the journal Science, Tyler Faith, from the Natural History Museum of Utah, and colleagues argue that long-term environmental change drove the extinctions.\n\nThis mainly took the form of an expansion of grasslands, in response to falling atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) levels.\n\n\"Despite decades of literature asserting that early hominins (human relatives) impacted ancient African faunas, there have been few attempts to actually test this scenario or to explore alternatives,\" said Dr Faith.\n\nA transition from eating mainly vegetables and fruit to predominantly eating meat may have driven the evolution of humans' big brains. This transition occurred in concert with the development of stone tools, which would have allowed our ancestors to butcher the carcasses of animals; either as scavengers or hunters.\n\nImage copyright Spl Image caption Artwork: The extinct giraffe Sivatherium maurusium vanishes from the fossil record around 700,000 years ago\n\nTo investigate whether humans played a role, the researchers compiled a seven-million-year record of herbivore extinctions in eastern Africa. They focused on the very largest species, the so-called \"megaherbivores\" which weigh more than 2,000lbs (907kg).\n\nToday, only elephants, hippos, giraffes and white and black rhinos fall into this category.\n\nBut the three-million-year-old human relative \"Lucy\" (Australopithecus afarensis) shared her East African habitat with three species of giraffe, two species of rhino, a hippo and four elephant-like species.\n\nAustralia extinction 'due to man'\n\nHuman link to giant turtle's end\n\nThe results of the analysis showed that over the last seven million years, some 28 lineages of large mammal went extinct in Africa.\n\nFurthermore, the onset of the herbivore decline began roughly 4.6 million years ago, and the rate of decline did not change following the appearance of Homo erectus, one of the earliest human ancestors that could have contributed to the extinctions.\n\n\"This extinction process kicks in over a million years before the very earliest evidence for human ancestors making tools or butchering animal carcasses and well before the appearance of any hominin species realistically capable of hunting them, like Homo erectus,\" said Dr Faith.\n\nImage copyright Spl Image caption The fossilised jawbone of a sabre-toothed cat from South Africa. The disappearance of massive herbivores may also have affected the carnivores that fed on them\n\nThe researchers also examined records of climatic and environmental trends. They conclude that the climate is a much more likely culprit than humans. Climate change seems to have been behind the replacement of large shrubs and trees by grasslands.\n\n\"The key factor in the Plio-Pleistocene megaherbivore decline seems to be the expansion of grasslands, which is likely related to a global drop in atmospheric CO\u2082 over the last five million years,\" said co-author John Rowan, from University of Massachusetts Amherst.\n\n\"Low CO\u2082 levels favour tropical grasses over trees, and as a consequence savannas became less woody and more open through time. We know that many of the extinct megaherbivores fed on woody vegetation, so they seem to disappear alongside their food source.\"\n\nThe loss of big mammals in Africa could also explain other extinctions that have been blamed on our ancient ancestors.\n\nFor example, some scientists have suggested that increasingly carnivorous early human groups led to a decline in predators and scavengers.\n\n\"We know there are also major extinctions among African carnivores at this time and that some of them, like saber-tooth cats, may have specialised on very large prey, perhaps juvenile elephants,\" said co-author Prof Paul Koch from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC).\n\n\"It could be that some of these carnivores disappeared with their megaherbivore prey.\"\n\nWriting in the same issue of Science, Ren\u00e9 Bobe and Susana Carvalho from the University of Oxford raised a few words of caution over the conclusions: \"It is not clear what ecological roles hominins played throughout the long evolutionary history of megaherbivores in Africa, and how these roles changed over time and varied across geographic space.\n\n\"Another question is when hominins became systematic predators of animals larger than themselves.\"\n\nThey added: \"The causes of megaherbivore decline are probably complex, multidimensional, and varied across time and space. The precise timing of key hominin behavioural innovations remains poorly constrained by the current archaeological and palaeontological records.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Final Still Game to launch new BBC Scotland TV channel", "description": "The comedy's ninth and last series will debut on 24 February 2019 - the first night of the new BBC Scotland channel.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-46303070", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4C4E/production/_104443591_stillgame.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T19:00:47Z", "content": "Image caption The last series of Still Game will begin on the launch night of the new channel The new BBC Scotland TV channel is to launch on 24 February next year and will feature the first episode of the final series of comedy Still Game.

They have got the makings of a good side.\n\nThey slipped up a couple of times at home earlier this season - losing to West Ham and drawing with Huddersfield - but, otherwise, they have beaten everyone you would expect them to, and Cardiff definitely fall into that category.\n\nLawro's prediction: 2-0\n\nMumford & Sons' prediction: 3-0\n\nFulham v Southampton\n\nYou nearly always get a bounce when you bring in a new manager, because players who have been in and out of the team feel they have got a chance to persuade him they should be starting.\n\nClaudio Ranieri is a bit of a feel-good appointment for the fans as well, and I am expecting him to have an instant impact at Craven Cottage after replacing Slavisa Jokanovic.\n\nSaints manager Mark Hughes is already under pressure and a defeat would obviously increase speculation about his own future.\n\nHis side were robbed in their last home game against Watford, in terms of a bad decision costing them, because there is no argument against the fact that Charlie Austin's goal should have stood.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Furious Austin rages about referee after disallowed goal\n\nBut you could also argue that Watford were probably good value for a draw in that game anyway - and it is Saints' performances, as well as their results, that have left Hughes' job under scrutiny.\n\nSouthampton's next two games after this one are at home to Manchester United and away to Tottenham, so things are not going to get any easier for him anytime soon.\n\nLawro's prediction: 2-1\n\nMumford & Sons' prediction: 2-1\n\nMan Utd v Crystal Palace\n\nCrystal Palace have not won any of their past seven games in all competitions, and have managed just four goals in that spell too.\n\nSo this is simply a game that Manchester United have to win - can you imagine the furore from their fans if they don't?\n\nIt is one thing for United to be out-played and beaten by a team as good as Manchester City, which is what happened in the derby last time out, but it will not be acceptable if they slip up here.\n\nLawro's prediction: 2-0\n\nMumford & Sons' prediction: 2-1\n\nWatford v Liverpool\n\nDespite the controversy over the way they got their point at Southampton before the international break, I actually thought Watford's performance at St Mary's was decent - that part of it seems to have been overlooked a bit.\n\nLiverpool beat Fulham last time out but, for the first time at Anfield this season, they were probably a little bit fortunate to get a win.\n\nThere was a question mark over whether Aleksandar Mitrovic's goal for Fulham should have stood just before the Reds took the lead, and they huffed and puffed a bit after that too - it was not a very fluid performance.\n\nIt does not matter that Liverpool are not at their best at the moment - that is not a problem - but their preparation for this game might be.\n\nThe Reds are obviously not the only team who have seen all their players disappear on international duty over the past fortnight but Jurgen Klopp has an important Champions League match at Paris St-Germain on Wednesday to think about too, which complicates things a little bit for the weekend.\n\nTaking all of that into consideration, I am going to go for a draw. I just have the feeling Watford will be lying in wait for them, and they will see Liverpool as a scalp - just like they did with Spurs when they beat them in September.\n\nLawro's prediction: 1-1\n\nMumford & Sons' prediction: 0-2\n\nWest Ham v Man City\n\nThe international break can be a distraction for the top teams and stop their momentum but I do not see that happening with Manchester City.\n\nCity boss Pep Guardiola will be on to his players straight away, ensuring they have got their focus back.\n\nIt is seven wins in a row for City in all competitions, and I think they will make it eight this weekend.\n\nWest Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini, who won the title with City in 2014, is starting to get some consistency from his attacking players like Felipe Anderson and Marko Arnautovic, but upsetting his old team is a big ask.\n\nLawro's prediction: 0-2\n\nMumford & Sons' prediction: 1-3\n\nTottenham v Chelsea (17:30 GMT)\n\nA lot has been made about Chelsea's impressive start under Maurizio Sarri, but Tottenham are only a point behind them.\n\nIf they win this, Spurs go above the Blues, which is an extra incentive - not that they need it, because there is not too much love lost between the two sides.\n\nLawro's prediction: 2-0\n\nMumford & Sons' prediction: 1-1\n\nSUNDAY\n\nBournemouth v Arsenal (13:30 GMT)\n\nWolves had umpteen chances and battered Arsenal last time out, and the Gunners were very fortunate to escape with a draw.\n\nI don't think Arsenal will be so lucky this time, however.\n\nI know they have built up a reputation for fighting back in games since Unai Emery took charge but I am expecting Bournemouth to cause them lots of problems, and also to hold on.\n\nLawro's prediction: 2-1\n\nMumford & Sons' prediction: 2-3\n\nWolves v Huddersfield (16:00 GMT)\n\nI was very impressed by Wolves in their draw at Arsenal - they did enough to win that game.\n\nThey should have too much for a Huddersfield side that have mustered two points and four goals from their five away games this season.\n\nLawro's prediction: 2-0\n\nMumford & Sons' prediction: 0-1\n\nMONDAY\n\nBurnley v Newcastle (20:00 GMT)\n\nNewcastle built up a bit of momentum with their results before the international break and now they have got a run of games where they will expect to pick up more points.\n\nNewcastle's next six Premier League games Home Away 1 December: West Ham 26 November: Burnley 9 December: Wolves 5 December: Everton 22 December: Fulham 15 December: Huddersfield\n\nI don't see them winning on Monday night, though.\n\nBurnley got a good point last time out at Leicester thanks to a determined defensive display and I think we will see more of the same here.\n\nA draw at Turf Moor is still a decent result though - and I think if you offered that to Magpies boss Rafa Benitez now, he would snap your hand off.\n\nLawro's prediction: 1-1\n\nMumford & Sons' prediction: 1-1\n\nHow did Lawro do last time?\n\nBefore the international break, Lawro got four correct results, including one perfect score, from 10 matches for a total of 70 points.\n\nHe beat WWE wrestlers Dolph Ziggler and Drew McIntyre. who got five correct results, but with no exact scores, for a total of 50 points.\n\nTotal scores after week 12 Lawro 1,020 Guests 900\n\nLawro v Guests P12 W5 D2 L5\n\n+/- DENOTE POSITION DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LAWRO'S TABLE AND ACTUAL POSITION TEAM P W D L PTS +/- =1 Man City 12 10 2 0 32 0 =1 Man Utd 12 10 2 0 32 +7 3 Liverpool 12 7 5 0 26 -1 4 Leicester 12 7 2 3 23 +6 5 Chelsea 12 6 4 2 22 -2 =6 Tottenham 12 5 5 2 20 -2 =6 Arsenal 12 6 2 4 20 -1 =8 Everton 12 6 0 6 18 +1 =8 Newcastle 12 5 3 4 18 +6 10 Crystal Palace 12 4 3 5 15 +6 11 Fulham 12 4 2 6 14 +9 =12 Bournemouth 12 3 4 5 13 -6 =12 Burnley 12 3 4 5 13 +3 =12 Southampton 12 4 1 7 13 +5 =15 Watford 12 4 0 8 12 -8 =15 West Ham 12 3 3 6 12 -2 17 Wolves 12 3 1 8 10 -6 18 Brighton 12 2 3 7 9 -6 19 Cardiff 12 1 4 7 7 -1 20 Huddersfield 12 1 2 9 5 -1\n\nGUEST LEADERBOARD 2018-19\n\nSCORE GUEST LEADERBOARD 120 Joe Thomas 90 Karl Pilkington, Chris Stark 85 Lawro (average after 12 weeks) 80 Richard Ashcroft, Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill, Greg James, Mark Wahlberg 60 Idris Elba 50 Bring Me The Horizon, Dolph Ziggler and Drew McIntyre. 40 Tom Grennan\n\nLawro's best score: 260 points (week seven v Karl Pilkington)\n\nLawro's worst score: 40 points (week three v Idris Elba and week eight v Chris Stark)"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Robert Rowan: Brentford plan tributes to former technical director", "description": "Brentford add former technical director Robert Rowan to their squad list after his death at the age of only 28.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46305293", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/17125/production/_104310549_13157228.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T18:47:15Z", "content": "Robert Rowan worked for Celtic and Stenhousemuir before joining Brentford in 2014 Brentford have added former technical director Robert Rowan to their squad list for the rest of the season after his death last week at the age of 28.

That has to be sustained and the way you do that is by communicating and talking and planning forward.\n\n\"So yes, it was a frustrating period but gradually we've worked our way through it and now come out the other end in a good position.

It's quite unique in its ability to poison individuals at very low concentrations,\" he added.\n\n'People could die from this'\n\nFor the first time, a nerve agent had been used in an attack in Europe.\n\nDoctors had to break the news to Det Sgt Bailey that he had been poisoned with Novichok.\n\n\"It's the fear of the unknown because it's such a dangerous thing to have in your system. Knowing how the other two were [and] how badly they'd been affected by it, I was petrified,\" he said.\n\nIntensive care doctors at Salisbury hospital were faced with something they had not dealt with before and, according to Dr Duncan Murray, there was \"a very real expectation\" all three could die.\n\nDet Sgt Bailey's treatment was both painful and stressful.\n\n\"I was conscious throughout the whole time,\" he said. \"I had lots of injections\u2026 I had five or six infusions at any one time in my arms.

Charlie had found a perfume bottle and given it to Dawn.\n\nBelieving it was a popular brand of perfume, she sprayed some on her wrists. In fact, officers believe the bottle had been used to smuggle the Novichok into Britain.\n\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon, who is leading the investigation, said there was a \"significant amount\" of nerve agent in the bottle - probably enough to kill \"thousands\".\n\n\"The amount that was in the bottle and the way it was applied to the Skripals' home address was completely reckless,\" he told BBC Panorama.\n\nThe UK government blames Russia for the attack.\n\nFor Det Sgt Bailey, it is something he has to come to terms with.\n\n\"It's such an outrageous, dangerous way of doing something that it angered me as well because any number of people could have been affected by that,\" he said.\n\nMental scars\n\nThe effects have not only been on his health.\n\n\"Physically I think I bounced back pretty well thanks to the hospital,\" he said.

for life in the United Arab Emirates has been widely criticised by British politicians and human rights organisations.\n\nMatthew Hedges was sentenced in a court in Abu Dhabi for spying.\n\nHis wife says there was no due process and the evidence against him was unfounded.\n\nThe UAE Attorney General Dr Hamad Saif Al Shamsi said Mr Hedges had \"confessed in detail to his crimes\" and was \"accorded full rights\" with a \"fair and transparent trial\".\n\nHow was Mr Hedges' trial conducted?\n\nIn the UAE defendants have the right to a lawyer at the time of trial, says Hiba Zayadin of Human Rights Watch, but not during pre-trial detention.\n\nAccording to the UAE foreign ministry, Mr Hedges accepted the services of a court-appointed lawyer in the first court session on 3 October.\n\nA ministry statement said the case against Mr Hedges was thoroughly investigated by the public prosecutor and \"compelling and powerful evidence was presented in court.\"\n\nThe trial on 21 November reportedly lasted just a few minutes. But, according to the foreign ministry, this is common because the court session was only to announce a verdict and deliver a sentence. The court, said the ministry, had met previously.\n\nMr Hedge's wife, Daniela Tejada, said he had been kept in solitary confinement for weeks without access to legal help.\n\nDuring that period, his family says he signed what transpired to be a confession in Arabic. Mr Hedges, according to his family, does not speak or read Arabic.\n\nLegal documents in the UAE are required to be in Arabic, says Abdul Khaleq Abdullah, an academic based in the UAE.\n\n\"When [these documents are] presented to someone who doesn't speak Arabic, there is a translator who explains it word by word.\"\n\n\"Yes he signed an Arabic document because this is the law of the land here, but he was given the full right to a translation.\"\n\nMs Zayadin says these rights are not always observed, and the quality of translation services can vary.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A court in Abu Dhabi handed down the sentence.\n\nThe importance of a confession\n\nMs Zayadin says the charges against Mr Hedges seem to have been largely based on a confession.\n\nShe says it is common in Gulf countries for a confession to be the main grounds on which a guilty verdict is delivered, particularly in state security cases such as this.\n\nBut these, she says, can be problematic.\n\nHuman Rights Watch has documented many allegations in the region of confessions which have been forcibly obtained without the presence of a lawyer, and defendants denied legal counsel or access to family members.\n\nWhat are the wider criticisms of the UAE's legal system?\n\nWhen a senior UN official investigated the UAE's judicial system in 2014, she found serious shortcomings.\n\nIn her report, Gabriela Knaul - the Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers - said she had found reports of \"serious breaches of fair trial and due process guarantees.\"\n\nThe report also noted instances where \"judges appear to have lacked impartiality and shown bias, especially with regard to non-nationals of the United Arab Emirates.\"\n\nDifficulties with the use of translators in the UAE have also been noted by the UN. The Special Rapporteur found that translations and interpretation in court cases involving non-Arabic speakers, required by law, \"were not always provided in practice, or that their quality was poor.\"\n\nRadha Stirling from Detained in Dubai, an organisation which has provided representation for foreign nationals in the UAE, says signing a confession without a translator in the UAE is \"standard practice.\"\n\nAccusations alone, with \"zero evidence\", can be enough to secure prosecution, she says.\n\nIn response to the criticisms levelled at the UAE, the justice ministry said the constitution guaranteed an independent judiciary and that the country was committed to strengthening human rights.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Six Nations: Scotland v Argentina (Sat)", "description": "Team news, match preview and statistics for Saturday's match between Scotland v Argentina at Murrayfield", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/46295499", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/E513/production/_104434685_gettyimages-1062832808.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T17:25:39Z", "content": "Scotland's unbeaten run at home in 2018 was brought to an end last weekend against South Africa. 2018 Autumn Internationals Venue: Murrayfield Date: Saturday, 24 November Kick-off: 17:30 GMT Coverage: Watch live on BBC One, Connected TVs, online and BBC Sport\u2026 [+3873 chars]", "fulltext": "Scotland's unbeaten run at home in 2018 was brought to an end last weekend against South Africa.\n\n2018 Autumn Internationals Venue: Murrayfield Date: Saturday, 24 November Kick-off: 14:30 GMT Coverage: Watch live on BBC One, Connected TVs, online and BBC Sport app from 14:00 GMT; listen on BBC Radio 5 live; text commentary on BBC Sport website.\n\nTeam news & line-ups\n\nScotland coach Gregor Townsend has moved Finn Russell to inside centre to accommodate Adam Hastings at fly-half.\n\nAllan Dell, Fraser Brown and Simon Berghan form a new front row, while Grant Gilchrist, Jamie Ritchie and Josh Strauss also come into the pack.\n\nBlair Kinghorn replaces Tommy Seymour on the wing.\n\nArgentina have made just two changes to their team that lost to France last week with flanker Rodrigo Bruni and centre Matias Moroni coming in.\n\nScrum-half Martin Landajo and winger Sebastian Cancelliere feature as replacements for the first time since the Rugby Championship.\n\nScotland: 15-Hogg, 14-Maitland, 13-Jones, 12-Russell, 11-Kinghorn, 10-Hastings, 9-Laidlaw (captain); 1-Dell, 2-Brown, 3-Berghan, 4-Gilchrist, 5-Gray, 6-Ritchie, 7-Watson, 8-Strauss\n\nReplacements: 16-McInally, 17-Allan, 18-Nel, 19-Skinner, 20-Wilson, 21-Horne, 22-Dunbar, 23-McGuigan\n\nArgentina: 15-Boffelli, 14-Delguy, 13-Moroni, 12-De la Fuente, 11-Moyano, 10-Sanchez; 1-Garcia Botta, 2-Creevy, 3-Medrano, 4-Petti, 5-Lavanini, 6-Matera (captain), 7-Bruni, 8-Ortega Desio\n\nReplacements: 16-Montoya, 17-Zeiss, 18-Sordoni, 19-Alemanno, 20-Lezana, 21-Landajo, 22-Orlando, 23-Cancelliere\n\nCommentator's notes\n\nAndrew Cotter: \"If the Test against South Africa was the biggest of Scotland's autumn, this meeting with Argentina is arguably the most important.\n\n\"Scotland need to deliver victory when starting as favourites, against opponents on a four-match losing streak - even if the Pumas did beat both South Africa and Australia in the Rugby Championship.\n\n\"Gregor Townsend is once again rotating players - not one man has started all four November Tests - and the big talking point is the selection of Adam Hastings at fly-half with Finn Russell at inside centre.\n\n\"It might be the way forward and it certainly screams potential for attack, but Scotland also have to show that they can, when required, marry that entertaining style with a cold and clinical edge.

Why has it proven so difficult? Kathy Marks looks at the vast challenges in Victoria alone - a state that is working towards a national first.\n\nEvery school holiday, the train would pick up Daria Atkinson and her four siblings, all aged under 10, and transport them - along with thousands of other Aboriginal children from the countryside - to Melbourne, where they would spend up to two months living with a white family.\n\n\"We had to call the adults mum and dad,\" recalls Ms Atkinson, now 56.\n\n\"We were told how to sit at the table, how to eat properly. We weren't allowed to get dirty. We had to forget we were Aboriginal. But at least we got to go home - the Stolen Generations didn't.\"\n\nHaving experienced first-hand one of Australia's misguided assimilation programs, Ms Atkinson now works with members of the Stolen Generations in Victoria - people who were permanently separated from their families.\n\nMany of them are still trying to reconnect with their community, culture and traditional country.\n\nThe quest has acquired a new urgency as Victoria paves the way for treaty discussions with the state's Aboriginal population - the first Australian jurisdiction to seek a formal agreement with its original inhabitants.\n\nWhat is a treaty in this context?\n\nA formal agreement that can redefine the relationship between a government and indigenous peoples\n\nFor many indigenous Australians, recognition of their sovereignty and right to self-determination is a priority\n\nA treaty can acknowledge and apologise for past wrongs, and establish a \"truth-telling\" process\n\nIt can include compensation for land and resources lost during colonisation\n\nIt can set out practical agreements on health, education, jobs and land use\n\nMultiple treaties, with different groups, are a likely outcome\n\nNext year will see the creation of a statutory Aboriginal Representative Body intended to be the voice of indigenous Victoria, which will hammer out ground rules for treaty negotiations in conjunction with the state government.\n\nIt has taken nearly three years of sometimes acrimonious consultations and more than $37m Australian dollars (\u00a321m; $27m) of public funds just to get to this point.\n\nNow controversy surrounds the representative body, where - under an official model - 11 of the 28 seats would be reserved for officially acknowledged \"language nations\" which occupied particular regions before European settlement.\n\nThere were, however, 38 such nations before colonisation.\n\nImage caption The state of Victoria alone has 38 \"language nations\"\n\n\"So the other 27 will have to fight over the leftovers,\" says Gary Murray, an Aboriginal elder, referring to the remaining 17 seats, to be decided via an election of all Aboriginal residents. \"And that's discriminatory.\"\n\nAlso potentially problematic is that only \"traditional owners\" - proven descendants of a language nation or clan (extended family) - will be eligible to stand in the election, or participate in eventual treaty talks, or share in benefits flowing from a treaty.\n\nThat means that some of the \"stolen\" people could be, in a significant way, excluded from the treaty process - a process that indigenous Australians have been demanding for decades, and which they hope will deliver them social justice and economic self-sufficiency while helping to heal the wounds of the past.\n\nMeanwhile, there is a more immediate issue: a state election this Saturday, which could lead to the process being junked, if the Labor government of Premier Daniel Andrews loses power.\n\nIn South Australia, the conservative Liberal government abandoned treaty negotiations with three Aboriginal nations after winning an election in March.\n\nThe Victorian opposition leader, Matthew Guy, is opposed to a state-based treaty, arguing that \"a national approach would be a much better way to go\".\n\nAustralia is the only Commonwealth country yet to conclude a treaty with its First Nations, although the subject has been debated on and off for years. Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke promised a treaty in 1988.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Bob Hawke receives the Barunga Statement, a landmark document, in 1988 - prompting his pledge for a treaty\n\nWith progress stalled at the federal level, several states and territories have embarked on their own treaty process. First off the block, in February 2016, was Victoria - where Mr Andrews' government has discovered how protracted and tortuous the process can be, even for just one state.\n\n\"It's mind-blowing, the amount of work that has gone into this to date,\" says Janine Coombs, one of the traditional owners on the Aboriginal Treaty Working Group, which advises the Victorian Treaty Advancement Commissioner.\n\nThat work has included four state-wide forums, dozens of regional community consultations and \"roadshows\", a six-day \"community assembly\" in Melbourne, and legislation enshrining the route to treaty talks, which the government hopes would discourage an incoming Liberal administration from jettisoning the process.\n\nThe election for the representative body, to take place across six voting regions, has thrown up multiple challenges. Should, for instance, traditional owners from interstate, now living in Victoria, be able to stand?\n\nWhat about indigenous Victorians living elsewhere - in some cases just across the Murray River, which forms a boundary with New South Wales?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The man who marched across Australia to call for a treaty\n\nAnd how will the vexed question of who is eligible to vote - who is, in fact, Aboriginal - be settled?\n\nIn Tasmania, in the early 2000s, bitter legal battles were fought over this issue, with the dominant Aboriginal community challenging the right of more than 1,000 people to vote in elections for an Aboriginal statutory authority.\n\nThe difficulties involved in setting up a representative body in Victoria - in unifying all the disparate Aboriginal voices - are a legacy of the state's colonial history, which saw indigenous groups pushed off their land and dispersed to distant missions and reserves.\n\nPolicies which later created the Stolen Generations severed yet more links with family, community and territory, resulting in a small, fragmented population which today numbers about 50,000.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A crowd watches a historic national apology to the Stolen Generations in 2008\n\nAs in other southern states which were swiftly and brutally settled, most Aboriginal Victorians have mixed ancestry.\n\nModel criticised as 'symbolic genocide'\n\nThe proposed model for the representative body, Ms Coombs believes, is the \"fairest and most inclusive possible\", with additional seats to be made available as more language nations complete a formal recognition process.\n\nMr Murray, though, says that not giving automatic representation to all 38 nations is \"offensive, repugnant and symbolic genocide\". And he warns that if the model is not amended, he and other vocal opponents will lodge complaints with state and national anti-discrimination authorities.\n\nTreaty negotiations could still be years off, but they promise to be extraordinarily complex, with up to 100 different clan groups seeking separate treaties and, in some cases, disputing each other's territorial boundaries and ancestry.\n\nNonetheless, some hope the Victorian process could kick-start a momentum that will lead to a federal treaty.\n\nMs Coombs says: \"This isn't a sprint; it's a marathon. The here and now is about setting the foundations and structures right, so that my grandsons and the next seven generations will get the outcomes and benefits.\n\n\"Because this opportunity may never come around again.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Could these changes save cyclists' lives?", "description": "Cyclists, motorists and experts speak to the BBC about government proposals to protect bike users.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46303370", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/181E0/production/_104448789_pa-16586290.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T16:15:11Z", "content": "Image copyright PA In a bid to protect cyclists, the government has announced 50 proposals to cater to bike users' needs and prevent collisions with motor vehicles.

Cycling UK believes so.\n\nDuncan Dollimore, head of campaigns for the charity, said: \"Although it's already an offence to park in a mandatory cycle lane, the reality is that the decline in police traffic numbers means this has been widely ignored and rarely enforced.\n\n\"Giving local authorities the power to enforce this offence with CCTV cameras is one of the simple solutions Cycling UK proposed in our response to the government's cycling and walking safety review.\"\n\nImage copyright Mick Sinclair / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAccidents - where is the burden of proof?\n\nIn its report, the government also said it will \"review how civil liability rules function\" in the UK, and look at how other countries operate.\n\nIn other words, it will review how people claim for compensation when they have been in a road traffic collision.\n\nCurrently, in the UK, if a cyclist is injured following a collision with a car and wants to claim for compensation, the burden is on the cyclist to prove the motorist was at fault.\n\nThe majority of other European countries, however, operate differently.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nMark Hambleton - a lawyer and expert in personal injury claims involving cyclists - explained that in the \"vast majority\" of European countries, the cyclist is \"presumed to be the vulnerable road user\".\n\n\"So, to encourage motorists to behave more cautiously around them, if there's an accident involving a motorist and a cyclist, the presumption is that the motorist is responsible for the accident,\" he explains.\n\n\"It just flips that responsibility for proving guilt and innocence on its head.\"\n\nWould this make drivers more aware?\n\nThe government has not provided, at this stage, any proof that changing civil liability laws would improve safety for cyclists, and the ALB said it would \"certainly oppose any change to make drivers automatically liable in accidents involving cyclists\".\n\nBut for Mr Hambleton, a cyclist himself, changes such as this could make drivers \"less reckless\" around bikes and pedestrians.\n\nHe adds, however, law changes are unlikely to save lives on their own - \"You have to improve infrastructure for cyclists, increase awareness and change the culture we have at the moment.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'I'm going to die on this roundabout' - a cyclist shares their helmet-camera footage\n\nUltimately, the government appears to acknowledge this with its 50 proposals, and, for some cyclists, any progress should be seen as a positive.\n\n\"I don't think people realise how vulnerable or how frightening it is to be a cyclist,\" said Lonny.\n\n\"Anything that makes people aware of the vulnerability and safety of other people on the road is a good step in the right direction.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Les Dennis graffiti mystery in Norwich", "description": "The actor denies being responsible for a spate of graffiti in Norwich city centre.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-46308262", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/122F4/production/_104448447_les.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T16:12:12Z", "content": "Image caption Our survey says... it wasn't Les Les Dennis has denied being responsible for a spate of graffiti in Norwich city centre.

We will not rest until the future arrangements are signed, sealed and delivered and we secure this critical control over access to our waters and who catches what stocks, where and when.\"\n\nLabour meanwhile has criticised the political declaration as \"26 vague and ambitious pages of buzzwords\".\n\nShadow Scottish Secretary Lesley Laird said the document \"makes a mockery\" of the \"red line\" set down by the Scottish Tories, saying that \"David Mundell must resign with immediate effect, and his colleagues must make clear that they will not support this half-baked deal\"."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Youth mental health report in charts", "description": "Trends and findings from the report into the Mental Health of Children and Young People in England", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46306241", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8F9C/production/_104446763_prevalence_by_gender_and_age-nc.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:31:12Z", "content": "Nearly one in four young women has some form of mental illness, a new NHS report has found.

Mental illness more common among young women\n\nYoung women aged 17 to 19 are more than twice as likely to be struggling as young men the same age, with anxiety and depression the most common disorders.\n\nGirls are more likely to struggle with mental health as they reach young adulthood.\n\nFor boys, meanwhile, the prevalence of mental illness doesn't change much among the age groups surveyed, even decreasing slightly among older teens.\n\nAmong primary-aged children, boys are nearly twice as likely to have some form of mental disorder, with some kind of behavioural disorder being the most common.\n\n2. Girls are far more likely than boys to have self-harmed\n\nOf young women aged 17 to 19 with some kind of mental illness, more than half reported that they had self-harmed or attempted suicide.\n\nJust over one in three young men with a mental illness reported the same.\n\nThe rate of girls who have self-harmed jumps from under a third among those aged 11 to 16, to more than half among older teens.\n\n3.

Under-fives studied for the first time\n\nThe 2017 survey looked at pre-school children for the first time. It found that overall, 5.5% of children aged between two and four were experiencing a mental disorder.\n\nChildren were only counted if they met criteria for a diagnosable disorder, rather than episodes of \"the terrible twos\" behaviour which are common among this age group.\n\nThere were higher rates for boys than for girls, particularly among behavioural disorders.\n\n5. The impact of income\n\nThe report found a link between poverty and poor mental health. Children and young people living in households with the lowest income levels were more than twice as likely to have a disorder as those in the highest income households.\n\nThe effect was even more pronounced among households where a parent was receiving benefits related to low income or disability.\n\nAlmost a third (31.8%) of children and young people with a parent receiving disability benefits had a mental disorder.\n\n6. Rates vary between ethnic groups\n\nWhite British children are much more likely to be struggling, as the report found that they were nearly three times as likely to have some form of disorder as black and Asian children.\n\nBlack and Asian girls are much more likely than boys within the same group to report mental health issues.\n\nAmong White British children, rates are the same for boys and girls.\n\nThe survey was conducted in English and the report's authors noted that this may have an effect on responses among some ethnic minority groups but not enough to override the findings."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Met Police launches campaign for workforce to be 50% women", "description": "The force launches a recruitment drive as it marks 100 years of women serving as police officers.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-46302654", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12966/production/_104443167_mediaitem104443166.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T15:27:56Z", "content": "Image copyright Met Police Image caption Nearly 8,000 women are employed by the Met, about 27% of its workforce The Met Police has launched a campaign to ensure half of its workforce is made up of women.

She also demanded that Google end its anti-competitive practices within 90 days or face further costs.\n\nGoogle is still appealing against the fine, but has come up with a system that it says makes shopping fairer.\n\nIt changed the shopping box, which is displayed at the top of search results, so that it is no longer populated with just Google Shopping ad results, but gives space to other shopping comparison services, who can bid for advertising slots.\n\nMeaningless bids\n\nGoogle also agreed to separate its comparison shopping service from the main company and to ensure that it operated at arm's length. The advertising slots it bids for would not be subsidised by revenue from its main ad business, it said.\n\nRivals described the auction process as \"neither compliant nor effective\".\n\n\"It has now been more than a year since Google introduced its auction-based 'remedy' and the harm to competition, consumers and innovation caused by Google's illegal conduct has continued unabated,\" the letter reads.\n\nThe main concern is that the system forces rivals to bid away \"the vast majority of their profits\" while Google's own bids cost nothing.\n\n\"Its bids are just meaningless internal accounting, paid from one Google pocket into another,\" reads the letter.\n\n\"As long as placement is determined by auction rather than relevance, it makes little material difference whether competitors occupy none, some or even all of the available slots,\" it goes on.\n\n\"In all cases, Google is the main beneficiary of any profits derived from these entries, and consumers are the main losers.\"\n\nToo late?\n\nShivaun Raff, the chief executive of lead complainant Foundem, told the BBC: \"People expect Google to deliver them the most relevant search results, but the truth is that Google is exploiting that trust and showing them results from advertisers who pay the highest price instead.\"\n\nIn response to the letter, Google said: \"We allow all comparison shopping services to compete equally to show product ads from merchants on Google's Search results page.\n\n\"To help drive awareness amongst merchants who are unfamiliar with these new opportunities, we're currently offering incentives for them to work with comparison shopping services. One year on, both services that existed before the remedy and services that are new to comparison shopping are participating successfully.\"\n\nSome think that the EU action and Google's subsequent solution is a case of shutting the door after the horse has bolted.\n\n\"The bigger issue here is that Google Shopping is the most successful shopping service because of what the firm did in the past, by favouring themselves,\" said David Foster, director of research firm Frontier Economics.\n\n\"While the current remedies might seem like too little too late, any regulator gets nervous about meddling too much.\"\n\nDaily fines\n\nThe rivals also accuse Google of encouraging ad agencies to \"pose\" as shopping comparison sites.\n\n\"Realising that it will never be possible to populate its new auction with enough genuine comparison shopping services to create even the veneer of a functioning remedy, Google has now set about populating it with fake ones instead,\" the letter reads.\n\nIn response to recent questions from reporters on whether this was true, Ms Vestager said that her team \"had noticed the practice\".\n\nThe European Commission can overturn the solution put in place by Google and force it to rethink it. And for every day that Google remains in non-compliance, it can impose daily fines of up to 5% of its global revenue.\n\n\"The Commission is already worrying about whether they got this right and they don't regard the matter as closed,\" said Mr Foster.\n\n\"Ms Vestager's agenda is all about cracking down on tech giants and she wants to be seen as being tough.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Ireland v USA: Coach Joe Schmidt makes 14 changes to starting line-up", "description": "Ireland coach Joe Schmidt makes 14 changes to his starting line-up for Saturday's final autumn Test against USA.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/46307822", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/148EA/production/_104420248_mccloskey.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T14:24:12Z", "content": "McCloskey has not featured in any of Ireland's previous three Tests this month Autumn international: Ireland v USA Venue: Aviva Stadium, Dublin Date: Saturday 24 November Kick-off: 18:30 GMT Coverage: Live on BBC Radio Ulster MW, BBC Sport website and BBC Spo\u2026 [+846 chars]", "fulltext": "Tadhg Beirne scored a try in Ireland's demolition of Italy at the start of November\n\nAutumn international: Ireland v USA Venue: Aviva Stadium, Dublin Date: Saturday 24 November Kick-off: 18:30 GMT Coverage: Live on BBC Radio Ulster MW, BBC Sport website and BBC Sport app, plus live text commentary.\n\nIreland coach Joe Schmidt has made 14 changes to his starting line-up for Saturday's final autumn Test against the USA at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin.\n\nCentre Garry Ringrose is the only player retained from the team which beat New Zealand 16-9 last Saturday.\n\nWill Addison, Stuart McCloskey and Darren Sweetnam earn only their third caps, with Joey Carbery and John Cooney forming the half-back partnership.\n\nMunster's Tadhg Beirne is named in the second row with Iain Henderson.\n\nUncapped Munster centre Sammy Arnold is named among the replacements.\n\nFormer Scarlets forward Beirne will have the chance to kick-start his Test career as he wins his fourth cap and makes only his second start.\n\nHead coach Schmidt confirmed he had always planned to make wholesale changes for the USA clash, then hailed lock Beirne's swift progress in the Ireland set-up.\n\n\"This was always part of the plan to make the changes, the two games book-ended the series and it's a chance to look at all of the 43 players across the four matches,\" said Schmidt.\n\n\"Tadhg (Beirne) has slotted in so well, coming off the bench a couple of times in Australia in the summer, and bedding in as part of the broader squad.\n\n\"And I thought Iain Henderson came on and did really well last week against New Zealand.\n\n\"Tadhg has a really instinctive feel for the game;

Theresa May describes it as the right deal for the UK.\n\nA few points to remember\u2026\n\nThis is not a legally binding document.\n\nIt's not very long either, but it has grown from last week's seven-page outline to 26 pages. It sits alongside the 585-page Draft Withdrawal Agreement (which will be legally binding if it gets ratified).\n\nThis is also a draft, agreed by negotiators, but it still needs to be approved by the leaders of all 28 EU countries at a summit scheduled to take place on Sunday. Don't expect major changes.\n\nFormal negotiations on everything it contains can only begin after Brexit has actually happened - currently after 29 March 2019.\n\nIt contains plenty of aspirations involving shared interests, close partnerships and ambitious co-operation, but many of the details are still to come.\n\nHere's an initial look at what's in the text:\n\nFuture relationship\n\nA reminder that this really is about everything, not just about trade: the entire scope of the future relationship between the UK and its nearest neighbours.\n\nBoth sides want that relationship to be as close and co-operative as possible but that aspiration will be tested in the years ahead.\n\nAgain, it's worth emphasising that this is not a legally binding document, so there are no guarantees about what the post-Brexit world will look like.\n\nAnd no-one can say for certain how long it will all take to negotiate.\n\nBottom lines\n\nThe bottom line of both parties is included early on.\n\nAnything that is negotiated must be consistent with the EU's four freedoms - the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.\n\nAnd nothing will be agreed that threatens the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.\n\nAs we've seen for months now, the issue of the Irish border is where the combination of these core principles becomes most complicated.\n\nTrade in goods\n\nSo trade in goods should be \"as close as possible\", but that's not the same as being frictionless.\n\nIt leaves a lot of wiggle room in negotiations, with no guarantee of the final outcome.\n\nThe two sides are committing themselves to an \"ambitious, wide-ranging and balanced\" economic partnership, based on a comprehensive free trade agreement.\n\nBut there is also repeated emphasis that there must be a level playing field, which ensures open and fair competition.\n\nThe more economic rights you retain, the EU is reminding the UK, the more obligations to which you have to sign up.\n\nCustoms\n\nWhen the outline of this draft emerged last week, this was a notion that raised alarm bells for many supporters of Brexit.\n\nDominic Raab mentioned it in his resignation statement. Their fear, which will not be dispelled by this draft text, is that temporary customs arrangements could easily turn into some form of permanent customs union, preventing the UK from doing its own trade deals on goods around the world.\n\nThe government denies this, and argues that there is nothing wrong in wanting ambitious customs arrangements in the future, including the need to avoid checks on what are known as \"rules of origin\".\n\nThe declaration also mentions explicitly an \"independent trade policy\" for the UK in the future.\n\nIrish border\n\nWe are, this emphasises, open to any solution that will avoid the proposed backstop solution, to keep the Irish border open.\n\nThat includes technological and other solutions that critics of the Brexit negotiations say have been ignored for too long.\n\nThe trouble is that technological solutions that avoid the need for any border infrastructure are not in operation anywhere in the world.\n\nRegulations\n\nUK officials see this as a key sentence, which suggests there is plenty of room for manoeuvre in the negotiations to come.\n\nIt makes clear, they argue, that it is not the case that the UK can only have either a basic free trade agreement (like Canada) or membership of the single market (like Norway), with nothing in-between.\n\nBut none of the language here commits the EU to anything specific.\n\nTrade in services\n\nAs expected, the regulation of financial services will be based on a system of \"equivalence\" and the aim is to negotiate the details in this key sector before the end of June 2020.\n\nThere's nothing in the language here to suggest that the UK will get better terms than any other third country dealing with the EU - but that will be a key negotiating aim.\n\nThere are also plenty of aspirational words on \"ambitious and comprehensive\" plans for the service sector in general, but there is an awful lot to negotiate.\n\nDigital commerce\n\nThere are plenty of nods towards the way the world economy is changing, and the importance of comprehensive agreements on data.\n\nThe UK hopes that in the negotiations to come, it can be well positioned to take advantage of new technologies and the digital economy.\n\nBut the EU has already made it clear that the UK cannot expect to have the same access to all EU databases - in various economic and security areas - as it would have as an EU member state.\n\nFreedom of movement\n\nThis fulfils the Prime Minister's pledge that the UK will take back control of its borders and free movement of EU citizens to the UK will come to an end. But it means, of course, that free movement for UK citizens travelling to the EU will also stop.\n\nThe document says both sides want to preserve visa-free travel for short-term visits (don't worry about your holidays) but it suggests by implication that visas could be introduced for longer stays.\n\nFishing rights\n\nThere is neutral language here, including the \"best endeavours\" principle that commits both sides to doing everything they can to reach a deal.\n\nBut that disguises the fact that there are still deep disagreements on fishing, and on getting the right balance between access for UK produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK fishing waters.\n\nExpect this one to run and run, because the UK is not alone in having a vocal fishing lobby with more political power than its overall contribution to the economy might suggest.\n\nSecurity\n\nThere is a lot in this document on security - both on internal police co-operation and on broader foreign policy and defence co-operation.\n\nThe EU needs the UK in many of these areas, but the draft makes clear that - on internal security matters in particular - there is a variety of legal and technical issues to overcome.\n\nWe can expect, though, that UK and EU foreign policy will be co-ordinated as closely as possible in the future.\n\nDisputes and courts\n\nRather like the Draft Withdrawal Agreement, the political declaration envisages a system of dispute resolution involving a joint committee and an arbitration panel.\n\nBut once again, on matters of EU law (and there will be a lot of that involved in any future relationship) the final word will rest with the European Court of Justice.\n\nThe government will point out that after Brexit the direct jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK will come to an end.\n\nTiming\n\nThere is a plethora of other issues in the draft document that this article hasn't covered: transport, energy, intellectual property and so on.\n\nBoth sides say they hope all these issues and more can be wrapped up by the end of 2020. It's an ambitious timetable.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Siberian mayor's drive to sell off council cars", "description": "New mayor of Russia's Yakutsk sets off to sell municipal cars to fund social cause.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-46296509", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2C0A/production/_104447211_b446a7a2-d410-4218-8948-6b04e0fd3467.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T13:36:17Z", "content": "Image copyright Sardana Avksentyeva Image caption Sardana Avksentyeva: \"The ones on the photo will be sold first.\" The new self-styled \"people's mayor\" of Yakutsk in Siberia is having a clear-out of the city's garage, promising to sell pricey foreign vehicles\u2026 [+2770 chars]", "fulltext": "Image copyright Sardana Avksentyeva Image caption Sardana Avksentyeva: \"The ones on the photo will be sold first.\"\n\nThe new self-styled \"people's mayor\" of Yakutsk in Siberia is having a clear-out of the city's garage, promising to sell pricey foreign vehicles in order to fund social schemes.\n\nSardana Avksentyeva swept to victory in September, beating a member of President Vladimir Putin's United Russia Party to become the first woman to take charge of the city in the process.\n\nHer election campaign centred on promises to avoid spending public funds on lavish parties, foreign trips or any other perks for her staff.

But then things went wrong, and the pictures of the aftermath of the accident tell their own story.\n\nIt took an hour to get him out of the car. Once in hospital, the first operation - he has since had 17 more - was seven hours long.\n\n\"The reality was the first big moment I was fighting to be alive,\" Kubica said in a BBC Sport interview in 2017.\n\n\"People are concentrating only on my arm because it is the biggest limitation. But the reality is I had fractures from my feet up to my shoulders on the right-hand side.\n\n\"I had many fractures and that's why it was so complicated and takes so long to recover. But of course my arm was the most damaged.\n\n\"The first two months were tough. I was lucky I was a sportsman and driving F1. That's probably why my arm is still there.\n\n\"But on the other hand there are moments when you have to forget who you are but you are a human being. This is maybe something where the situation was not easy to cope.\"\n\nEighteen months after the accident, Kubica was back in a rally car - and he won the first event he took part in.\n\n\"People were seeing me and concentrating on getting me as fast as possible back to the car,\" he said. \"In the end, I decided first I have to wake up in the morning happy, then I can start to be a racing driver.\n\n\"It probably took me over two years to get back to a reasonable level. I had for months, even a full year, pain everywhere depending on the conditions I was in.\n\n\"You have to first of all feel good with yourself before doing something which requires being fast or driving a racing car. It is not that I lost my biggest passion - it is still racing.\n\n\"But also my general life has changed a lot and this was crucial.\"\n\nKubica raced in the WRC Wales Rally Great Britain in 2013 (pictured) but went on to win the inaugural WRC-2 title\n\nThe long road back to F1\n\nBy 2013, Kubica's arm was sufficiently recovered for him to do some work in the Mercedes F1 simulator, but it did not have the necessary movement for him to drive an F1 car. He was not able to rotate his wrist enough - he could turn left only by lifting his elbow, which is not possible in an F1 cockpit.\n\nInstead, he turned to rallying, and spent three seasons competing in the world championship, proving blisteringly fast and brave, but prone to big crashes.\n\nBy the end of 2015, the money had run out.\n\n\"I didn't know if I would get the chance to return to F1,\" Kubica said, \"but after rally time I had a difficult period. I was weighing 10kg, perhaps 15kg, over normal weight. So I started preparing.\"\n\nKubica emerged in F1 as Sauber's test driver in 2006, with Jacques Villeneuve (left) and Nick Heidfeld the main drivers\n\nHe systematically tried a range of racing cars to see if he could be competitive in them, explored the idea of returns in DTM German touring cars and the World Endurance Championship.\n\nThe turning point was around December 2016, when he spent some time in the simulator at the Italian racing car constructor Dallara, and realised an F1 return might now be a realistic possibility.\n\n\"I needed to get back in a proper rhythm of my life and if the chance will come I need to get the maximum out of it,\" he said. \"In most of the cars I was able to achieve what was my target and four months ago nobody could expect this and that's why I really appreciate the chance Renault are giving me. But I want to do my best.\"\n\nThe guys at Renault had kept in touch, and they suggested a one-off test in a 2012 F1 car.\n\nThat came in Valencia in June 2017. It was about completing the circle more than anything else, just to give him a chance to try it again after so long. But he impressed so much - completing more than 100 laps, quicker than the team's reserve driver - that a second test, this time much more serious, was arranged.\n\nThat test came at Paul Ricard in the south of France, after which hopes were still alive of a comeback. But then, after a third test in the team's 2017 car at the Hungaroring, Renault cooled - he had not been quick enough.\n\nWilliams, though, were interested, and started talks. They got to the verge of him signing a contract to race in 2018, but then another test put a spanner in the works.\n\nIn Abu Dhabi last year, immediately after the end of the season, Kubica drove and so did Williams race driver Lance Stroll and Russian hopeful Sergey Sirotkin.\n\nOnce they had stripped out the variables of fuel load, tyre type and car set-up, Williams found that Kubica, while faster than Stroll, was slower than Sirotkin. And the Russian had more than double the amount of sponsorship he could bring to the team, which made the decision easy. Sirotkin it was; Kubica was offered the role as reserve driver.\n\nKubica drove for Renault at in-season testing in Budapest in 2017\n\nSo what has changed a year on?\n\nKubica has done a number of tests for Williams this year, as well as work in the simulator. In the virtual world, the word is he is quicker than Stroll and Sirotkin. This has been less immediately apparent in the real world, but events have turned in Kubica's favour.\n\nStroll and his money are off to Force India, now run by his father after a mid-season takeover.\n\nSirotkin, meanwhile, has not been especially impressive in his debut season - he has out-qualified the Canadian 12 times in 20 races, but his advantage has not been as great as the team or his backers had hoped. As a result, he has less money available than last year, and Kubica has been able to find more.\n\nAt the same time, Kubica is well-liked within the team, has excellent technical feedback, his promotion has a feel-good factor about it as well as a positive PR effect, and there is the hope that with more time in the car he will be able to recover his former abilities.\n\nAlongside him, hopes are very high for new signing George Russell, a British driver poised to win the Formula Two title this weekend, a Mercedes protege and one of the most highly rated prospects in the sport.\n\nWhy the keenness on Kubica?\n\nKubica took victory at the Canadian Grand Prix in 2008 finishing 16.495 secs ahead of his BMW Sauber team-mate Nick Heidfeld\n\nKubica won just one race in his F1 career - the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix. So why, some may wonder, is there such a fuss about his comeback?\n\nOn one level, the answer to that is obvious. If a man with this sort of disability, after going through so much, can return to F1 after eight years and be competitive, it is awe-inspiring.\n\nBut beyond that, there is the possibility of a mega-talent being back in F1.\n\n\"Robert's one of the quickest drivers I've ever raced against,\" said Hamilton. \"He's one of the best drivers I've driven against.\n\n\"Just raw, natural talent, which I think as a sport it's a shame we don't have here with us - because there's not a lot that comes through. Not a lot of great, great drivers come through. You have some that are much better than the rest, but still not the greatest, and then you have real special drivers like him.\"\n\nKubica's last season was his finest. In the Renault, not a fully competitive car, he put in some stunning performances, the best ones at the three greatest drivers' circuits on the calendar - Monaco, Spa and Suzuka.\n\nHe qualified second, third and fourth at those races, places the car had no right to be. And was equally impressive in the grands prix.\n\nKubica had to stop his TV interviews immediately after qualifying in Japan because he found he could not speak. He went away to sit by himself for 10 minutes while he contemplated what he had just done.\n\nRenault sporting director Alan Permane, who was instrumental in organising Kubica's tests for the team in 2017, says: \"Suzuka qualifying in 2010 was a lap like I've never seen from anyone else, ever. He came in absolutely white, having scared the life out of himself.\"\n\nFrom a man who has been in F1 for more than 25 years and worked alongside Michael Schumacher and Alonso, that is quite a compliment.\n\nHow do his limitations affect him?\n\nIn 2007, Kubica escaped with a minor concussion and a sprained ankle from a horrific crash at the Canadian GP\n\nSeeing Kubica in the paddock, his right arm clearly limited in movement, and watching on-board footage from his car, it seems incredible that he can drive close to the absolute pace of F1.\n\nBut as he says: \"I drive like my body and my limitations leave me to do it. After my accident, I discovered that to do a roundabout in the road car, you don't have to grab the steering wheel, you can use friction to turn.\n\n\"F1 is not a road car, but I have been also in school where they give you a bird in the hand and you have to hold it [so] that it doesn't fly away but you cannot hold it too much that it gets scared. This is the way you have to hold the steering wheel.\n\n\"When I was racing in the past, in Malaysia on one of the first weekends I did in 2006 [as BMW test driver], there was footage when you see me driving with three fingers open. And the engineers were shocked.\n\n\"They said, 'Why?' I said: 'I don't know. Probably you don't need to use all the power you have.

This team - and the way coach Dave Rennie has them motoring - can beat you from anywhere.\n\nThey had less of the ball and less of the territory in that first 40 minutes. Nick Williams, the Blues' rock of a number eight, dominated them at the breakdown. They shipped seven penalties. Yet they led by 25 when it was over.\n\nGlasgow were devastating. They ran from deep at searing pace and, most of the time, had the precision to match. After Jarrod Evans opened the scoring with a penalty, off they went.\n\nAli Price should have run in the first try when Nick Grigg sent him steaming up the middle, but a fabulous cover tackle from Tom Williams knocked the ball from his grasp right at the line.\n\nBlues didn't hit touch with the clearance, and another Glasgow wave came at them. Ruaridh Jackson, a classy influence at full-back, drew three players and put Ashe trundling over. Pete Horne converted.\n\nThe second was a real crowd-pleaser. Matawalu, Scotstoun's darling box-office Fijian, blasted through a cleverly-crafted hole in the Blues defence, stepped Williams and plunged over.\n\nIt was vintage Matawalu, a man whose outrageous skill-set and propensity for the kamikaze make him utterly unique and deeply cherished. Horne kicked the extras to take the score to 14-3.\n\nEvans skewed a penalty wide and Price, scampering free again, timed his pass to George Turner wrong, allowing Tom Williams to bat the ball away and prevent a certain try.\n\nStill, Warriors continued to carve Blues open. They got their third score on the half-hour and it was a beauty.\n\nPrice took a penalty quickly just outside the home 22. Stafford McDowall powered away, off-loaded over the top to Jackson, who brilliantly flipped it behind his back to Grigg.\n\nThe little centre released Gibbins and the captain fended and stretched well through the tackle to finish.\n\nHorne put the conversion over, then struck the post with a penalty. The bonus point soon followed. Seymour started the move with a delightful catch-and-pass to Grigg, and tracked his team-mate up the touchline, took the ball back and coasted in.\n\nRory Hughes scored Glasgow's fifth try from an Ali Price grubber kick\n\nCenturion Matawalu steals the show\n\nBlues came rumbling back. They won three penalties and put each to the corner, but couldn't get over, Matawalu holding Olly Robinson up just short and Kiran McDonald pilfering a line-out with the clock red. Scotstoun roared and Glasgow made it to half-time with their line intact.\n\nThe second half began with another power-laden Welsh raid. It looked for all the world that Lloyd Williams had burrowed over, but the officials ruled otherwise.\n\nThey went for the corner again and this time, finally, Dacey drove to the whitewash, Evans failing with the conversion. They had their score but they had to work so hard for it when Glasgow had thundered through them at will.\n\nGlasgow wobbled a bit in the immediate aftermath of the Dacey try, but they kept the ball and scored a fifth. Price side-footed a grubber into the corner, Tom Williams slipped and Hughes scooped up the ball and slid in.\n\nHorne missed the conversion, and the Blues kept throwing punches. They landed another one on the hour mark when Evans powered through Grigg's tackle and bagged seven more points.\n\nAs Blues came again, and began to take more risks, Matawalu slew them. The Fijian picked off Evans' teasing pass and roared some 80m to score, Horne converting.\n\nThere was almost a perfect finale for Matawalu, the incredible centurion coming within a whisker of a hat-trick and a sixth try in two matches.\n\nHe swaggered up the right, chipped one defender, ignored two free team-mates to clip the ball past another, and couldn't quite get to it before it bobbled out.\n\nBonkers hair billowing in his wake, it was Matawalu in microcosm - flamboyant, breathless, ridiculous - the show-stopper delivering on his special night.\n\nMatawalu was named man of the match and has now scored 36 tries for Warriors\n\nGlasgow Warriors: Jackson;

It is a remarkable comeback for the man who was seen as having the potential to be every bit as good as his contemporaries Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel - only to be badly injured whilst rallying before the 2011 season.\n\nHe went off-course and collided with a barrier that subsequently penetrated the car and went into Kubica's arm and body.\n\nHe was fortunate to survive. But the injuries to his hand were such that it was thought he would never drive again; even though the hand was reattached, he lacked dexterity and feeling.\n\nBut with great determination he has slowly worked his way back and, remarkably, he has convinced the bosses at the famous Williams team that he can do the job for them.\n\nHere are five other drivers who came back to success after suffering devastating injuries.\n\nAlex Zanardi\n\nZanardi now competes regularly in Ironman competitions\n\nKnown by his full name Alessandro when he first broke into F1 in 1993, Zanardi's life is the stuff of movies.\n\nUnsuccessful in that first spell as his team, Lotus - who had once provided race-winning cars for Jim Clark, Graham Hill and Ayrton Senna - collapsed, the Italian went to race instead in the US in Indycar.\n\nHe took pole in his second race, was voted Rookie Of The Season in his first year and then won two titles in 1997 and 1998, enough to get him a drive back in F1 with Williams in 1999.\n\nBut again it did not go well. Williams' car was underpowered, Zanardi's driving was erratic and both typically struggled to make the top 10.\n\nAfter just one season, Zanardi was replaced by future World Champion Jenson Button and he went back to the US. In his comeback race he started from last on the grid but made his way all the way up to first place.\n\nBut when he spun on cold tyres, his car was hit in the side by another driver. Zanardi lost his legs in the impact.\n\nThis was not the end of his time in sport, however.\n\nAfter getting prosthetic legs, he went on to drive in the World Touring Car Championship - before turning his hand, quite literally, to handcycling.\n\nHis first race was the 2007 New York marathon, where he finished fourth. Building on that he won two golds and a silver at the 2012 Paralympics - and then the same again at Rio 2016.\n\nNot only that, he got a role as Guido in the three Pixar Cars films.\n\nAlessandro Nannini\n\nNannini was able to compete at the top level with an adapted car\n\nNannini was the ultimate victor of one of the most famous races of all time - the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix, when Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna collided.\n\nProst could not continue but Senna raced on after a push start, getting a new nose for his damaged car, taking Nannini and crossing the line first. But he was disqualified for cutting a part of the track when he rejoined the race, gifting Nannini his only win.\n\nA year later, Nannini - the younger brother of famous Italian singer Gianna - was involved in a helicopter crash that severed his hand completely.\n\nMiraculously, microsurgery was able to reattached the limb, although Nannini never regained full feeling in it.\n\nThis meant that - despite testing a Ferrari with a specially adapted steering wheel - he was not able to race in F1 again. But as his compatriot Zanardi would later do, he went to touring cars - where he was very successful, taking many wins in 1993 and 1994.\n\nHe then totally changed career, setting up an international chain of upmarket coffee shops in his own name.\n\nGerhard Berger\n\nBerger (right) was a great friend of the legendary Ayrton Senna\n\nShortly before the 1984 season in which he made his debut, Gerhard Berger would make an extraordinary escape - though this accident was not on the racetrack.\n\nTravelling down a quiet country lane late at night in his native Austria, Berger was startled when a car pulled out of a side road and collided with him.\n\nHe was thrown from his seat, through the air and landed in a river, breaking his neck.\n\nHe would certainly have died had it not been for the extraordinary coincidence that two doctors, who had turned off the autobahn on a detour in search of food, happened to be behind Berger.\n\nKnowing exactly what to do, the doctors carefully removed Berger from the river without causing further damage to his spine, and then took him to hospital where he had rods inserted into his neck.\n\nThe rods were certainly tested - in 1988 Berger had a colossal accident at the Tamburello curve at the San Marino Grand Prix that would later kill Senna - but he survived to enjoy a Grand Prix career that would last until 1997 and include 10 wins.\n\nGraham Hill\n\nHill's accident at least gave him more time to work on his media career\n\nMany divide double champion Graham Hill's career into two: the superstar before, and the long decline after, the terrible accident in 1969 that broke both his legs.\n\nHill was the reigning World Champion when he crashed badly at the US Grand Prix. Resting up in hospital, the famously witty Hill was asked what message he had for his wife; he replied, \"Just tell her that I won't be dancing for two weeks.\"\n\nWhile it is true that Hill did not win a race again after that, he did actually put in many good drives - but he was struggling with bad machinery, not least that of his own team, which he set up in 1973.\n\nNevertheless in 1972 - three years after the accident - he won the Le Mans 24 hours sportscar race, making him the only man in motor racing history to have achieved the \"triple crown\" of Monaco Grand Prix, Indianapolis 500 and Le Mans. He still holds that honour, despite Fernando Alonso's best efforts.\n\nJuan Manuel Fangio\n\nFangio wore a neck brace for four months after the accident\n\nThe man many still regard as the greatest driver of all time only raced in the World Championship for eight years - but missed an entire season in 1952 owing to a horrendous crash in Italy.\n\nThe Argentine, who was the reigning champion, had agreed to drive in a non-championship race in Monza only a day after racing in Northern Ireland - but missed a connecting flight from the French city of Lyon, meaning he had to drive through the night over the mountain roads of the Alps to make the start.\n\nHe arrived only 30 minutes before the 1430 start. The rules strictly should have excluded him, but such was his renown that the other drivers persuaded the organisers to let him enter anyway, from the back of the grid.\n\nIncredibly tired, Fangio crashed on the second lap and was thrown from the car, breaking his neck.\n\nThe injury caused him to miss the whole of the 1952 season. But he was intensely lucky not to have been killed - F1 cars at the time had very little in the way of safety features, and drivers wore what were little more than leather hats for protection.\n\nBut survive he did - and, after he spent 1953 feeling his way back into the sport, he won four titles in a row from 1954 to 1957."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Dos Erres massacre: Ex-soldier sentenced for killing 171", "description": "Santos L\u00f3pez was convicted for his role in a notorious 1982 massacre in a Guatemalan village.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-46302000", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B36E/production/_104443954_gettyimages-120261326.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T11:19:20Z", "content": "Image copyright JOHAN ORDONEZ/AFP Image caption Relatives of the victims of the Dos Erres massacre have been campaigning for justice for years A Guatemalan former soldier has been sentenced to more than 5,000 years in prison for his role in a massacre during \u2026 [+2282 chars]", "fulltext": "Image copyright JOHAN ORDONEZ/AFP Image caption Relatives of the victims of the Dos Erres massacre have been campaigning for justice for years\n\nA Guatemalan former soldier has been sentenced to more than 5,000 years in prison for his role in a massacre during the country's civil war.\n\nMore than 200 people were killed in the village of Dos Erres in 1982, one of the most violent episodes in Guatemala's brutal 36-year conflict.\n\nSantos L\u00f3pez was found responsible for 171 of the deaths.\n\nHe was a member of the Kaibiles, a US-trained counter-insurgency force fighting left-wing guerrillas.\n\nL\u00f3pez was sentenced to 30 years for each of the 171 killings committed in the village and to an additional 30 years for his role in the murder of a girl who had originally survived.\n\nUnder Guatemalan law, however, the maximum time any person can spend in jail is 50 years.\n\nGruesome operation\n\nThe special unit of the Guatemalan army stormed the village in the north of the country on 6 December 1982.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Kaibiles suspected the villagers of sympathising with left-wing guerrillas who had two months earlier carried out an ambush on a nearby army patrol, leaving 21 soldiers dead.\n\nEven though the soldiers' search of the village did not uncover any of the weapons the guerrillas had seized during the ambush, the Kaibiles proceeded to kill the village's inhabitants.\n\nGuatemala's civil war 1960-1996\n\nThe conflict pitted left-wing, mostly Mayan insurgents against the state\n\nThe Guatemalan government, backed by the US, waged a vicious campaign to eliminate the guerrillas\n\nMore than 200,000 people, most of them indigenous Mayan civilians, were killed or disappeared\n\nOver several days, the soldiers systematically shot or bludgeoned to death hundreds of men, women and children.

His daughter was also wounded as they left the arena when the bomb went off.\n\n\"It doesn't make things any easier but it means at last there is some compassion being shown and some accountability in terms of people saying 'We didn't do our job'.\n\n\"It's a start. It's just sad that it's taken 18 months,\" he said.\n\nAnother survivor, Robby Potter, who took his 11-year-old daughter Tegan to the concert, said he was considering taking legal action against MI5.\n\nHis injuries from 37 pieces of flying shrapnel have meant he's been unable to return to his job as a drainage engineer, and now drives lorries.\n\n\"I'd have more respect for them if they had said immediately after [the attack] 'we made a mistake - we underestimated this man',\" he said.\n\n\"I love my country but I was let down. This could have been stopped, and we're finding out now that it should have been stopped.\"\n\nIn their highly-critical report, MPs and peers on the committee also found:\n\nMeasures to control access to chemicals needed for bomb-making were \"hopelessly out of date\"\n\nCommunication companies were still failing to meet their social duties to detect terror planning online - and it recommended putting pressure on them by targeting their profits\n\nThere had also been \"fundamental failings\" by the Home Office, police and Surrey County Council over their handling of the teenager who placed a bomb on the London Underground in September 2017\n\nMI5 should rethink how it \"joins the dots\" on some suspects because it had failed to appreciate the potential dangers posed by Khalid Masood, the Westminster Bridge attacker, despite a trail of evidence over six years\n\nThe committee also attacked the Home Office for failing to properly co-operate over its attempts to investigate how the Parsons Green attacker, Ahmed Hassan, went undetected.\n\nIt had made \"multiple attempts\" to extract the \"full evidence\" from the Home Office - but the information had not been provided in time.\n\n\"This is unacceptable,\" said the committee. \"From what we have seen to date there were fundamental failings in the handling of this case by the Home Office, the police and Surrey County Council.\n\n\"This litany of errors will require a separate comprehensive review to which the Home Office must be directly answerable.\"\n\nAnalysis: Intelligence on suspects is fragmentary\n\nSalman Abedi was a \"closed subject of interest\" for MI5 - someone who had once been a cause of concern - but there had been an assessment on the available intelligence that he was not going to turn to violence.\n\nThat meant the 22-year-old went into a pool of 20,000 closed SOIs - people who are not under active investigation anymore.\n\nWhat the review makes clear is that the system for triggering a rethink of individuals in that closed group was too slow to react to a changing picture - and the security service has acknowledged its processes didn't, on this occasion, deliver.\n\nThe big problem is that intelligence on suspects is fragmentary. A British-Libyan young man travelling to Libya is not the stuff of red alerts.\n\nBut his visit to a jailed recruiter and facilitator would have been a relevant piece of information for the review of Abedi that had been planned. That information hadn't reached MI5 before the attack.\n\nAnd that's why the committee says there are really serious questions to be answered by all arms of government over whether everyone is learning lessons from every terrorism conspiracy of recent years.\n\nThe committee said that despite these concerns about government, it recognised that MI5 and the police had taken the mistakes seriously.\n\n\"We note that both MI5 and counter-terrorism policing have been thorough in their desire to learn from past mistakes,\" it said.\n\n\"We also know and acknowledge the determination with which they approach their work, which we regard as impressive.\n\n\"However, it has been striking how many of the issues which arose in relation to the 2017 terrorist attacks have been previously raised by this committee in our reports on the 7/7 attacks [in 2005] and on the killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby [in 2013].\n\n\"We have previously made recommendations in all these areas yet the government failed to act on them. The lessons of last year's tragic events must now result in real action.\"\n\nHome Secretary Sajid Javid said: \"We have updated our counter-terrorism strategy, introduced new legislation to allow threats to be disrupted earlier and have increased information-sharing with local authorities.\n\n\"We are also ensuring technology companies play their part by stopping terrorists from exploiting their platforms,\" he added.\n\nScotland Yard said the police and MI5 have foiled 13 plots since the Westminster attack in March 2017.\n\nAssistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the head of counter-terrorism policing, said: \"We will not let the terrorists who carried out these appalling attacks to succeed in scaring and dividing us.\"\n\nThe Met was, he said, doing more now to improve the handling and assessment of intelligence and making better use of data.\n\nIt is currently handling more than 700 live investigations, involving 3,000 people posing the biggest threat and another 20,000 who are also considered a concern.\n\nTerror attacks in 2017\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\n22 March: Khalid Masood runs down and kills four people on Westminster Bridge before stabbing a policeman to death outside Parliament.\n\n22 May: Salman Abedi, 22, detonates a home-made bomb in Manchester Arena's foyer blowing crowds off their feet as they leave an Ariana Grande concert.

I thought when he got older he would be OK but, as time went on, I realised she was right.\n\n\"The diagnosis is a relief. It is hard but it's also good to know. He is special. Me and my girlfriend have been given something so special so we are happy to look after him.\"\n\nThe 28-year-old, who joined the Latics from Chesterfield in June 2017, has worked with the club on raising awareness of autism and helped make the packs become a reality.\n\nAny autistic supporter is eligible to receive a pack from the club, subject to Vose's assessment of how much of a positive impact it might make.\n\n\"It's only a little thing, but to autistic children it keeps them going,\" said Gardner. \"It keeps them in the zone. It's little things to us but big things to them.\n\nVose added: \"Dan went round the changing room and fundraised to buy the packs. The players put money into a little collection and he gave us the funds to sort the packs.\n\n\"Footballers get a bad press, but they have supported the initiative.

It's quite strange because it's obvious now he has autism and learning difficulties, but when he was little it was a bit odd.\n\n\"There were a couple of great clubs where Joe grew up and because there were a few people who knew who I was, they would say 'oh is your son not joining in?' and I said 'Joe's a bit different'.\n\n\"Of course you always think when you find out you're having a little boy, that at some stage you will do those dads and lads things, like going to the match or having a game of golf.\n\n\"None of those things have happened but, to be honest, they were my dreams and not Joe's.\"\n\nWagg knows first hand the impact that a football match can have on his son and is impressed with what the Latics are offering.\n\nHe continues: \"I did take him to a game once which was a charity game at Altrincham, because I have a connection with the club, and he did wander onto the pitch.\n\n\"I was really impressed with what Oldham are doing because I know kids that are less severe than Joe who have a real passion for football.\n\n\"However, their autism comes with certain caveats and often the problem with a football match for an autistic child is sensory overload.\"\n\n'You can't beat an afternoon at the football'\n\nThe Chase star Anne Hegerty was praised for opening up about her Asperger's on this year's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here\n\nAlthough the club have made a start, they realise there is still more work to be done on making a football match a more welcoming environment.\n\n\"There's more awareness of autism now, especially with Anne [Hegerty] from I'm A Celebrity talking about autism and that will get it into the mainstream,\" said Vose.\n\n\"For Oldham it's just the start. We work really closely with the football club and we're looking at other disabilities. We can't conquer everything at once, but we are looking at the next step.\n\n\"We're a small club and each and every one of our fans mean something. When you're in League Two and getting smaller crowds, you can't afford to have any barriers for fans not to attend.\n\n\"By having initiatives such as these sensory packs, for nine people it's taken away a barrier to attend an Oldham Athletic match.

This triggered droughts in some parts of the world, which in turn reduced the ability of forests and vegetation in these areas to soak up CO2, hence more of it stayed in the atmosphere.\n\nDoes that lower rise mean that some progress is being made?\n\nNot so much. Scientists are very worried that when they measure the chemistry of the atmosphere they find that things are still going in the wrong direction.\n\n\"I am very concerned that the three greenhouse gases most responsible for climate change (CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide) are all rising upwards unabated,\" said Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 from the University of East Anglia.\n\n\"CO2 concentrations are now well above 400ppm - levels were 321ppm when I was born, that is a big rise in a human lifetime!\"\n\nWhat about this mysterious CFC-11 gas?\n\nThere have been a number of reports about CFC-11, a gas that's used in home insulation. Unfortunately, production is a real double whammy for the environment, damaging the ozone layer while also contributing to global warming.\n\nImage copyright NASA/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Image caption The ozone hole over Antarctica in the year 2000\n\nUnder the 1987 Montreal Protocol, the global agreement to protect the ozone layer, CFC-11 was supposed to be phased out of production.\n\nInstead researchers have seen a marked slowdown in reductions in the level of this gas, indicating that someone, somewhere is making new batches.\n\nEarlier this year, the Environmental Investigation Agency traced CFC-11 production to a number of factories across China.\n\nScientists in the field are worried that the detected levels of this mysterious chemical may be a harbinger of worse things to come.\n\n\"It's possible that the new emissions are the tip of the iceberg,\" said Dr Matt Rigby, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Bristol.\n\n\"If the signals we've seen are due to CFC-11 released during the manufacture of products such as foams, there could be much more that has been locked up in these new materials, which will ultimately be released to the atmosphere over the coming decades.\"\n\nWhat about methane and nitrous oxide?\n\nThe news on these two gases is not good either. Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas, and about 60% of it in the atmosphere comes from human activities like cattle farming, rice cultivation and fossil fuel extraction.\n\nLevels in the atmosphere are now about 1,859 parts per billion - 257% of what they were before the industrial revolution, and the rate of increase is pretty constant over the last decade.\n\nNitrous oxide comes from natural and human sources including fertiliser use and industry. It's now about 122% of pre-industrial levels.\n\nWhat are the implications of all these rises?\n\nEssentially, they underline the fact that there is no sign in the atmosphere that efforts to cut greenhouse gases are having any success.\n\nThe report also highlights the fact that these gases can impact our climate for centuries after they have been emitted.\n\n\"CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years and in the oceans for even longer,\" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Elena Manaenkova.\n\n\"There is currently no magic wand to remove all the excess CO2 from the atmosphere.\n\n\"Every fraction of a degree of global warming matters, and so does every part per million of greenhouse gases.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Climate change is likely to increase wildfire impacts\n\nWill this new study have any impact?\n\nThe scientists behind it certainly hope so. They believe that their analysis needs to be seen alongside the recent IPCC 1.5C report which warned that the world needed to be essentially carbon neutral by 2050.\n\nThe WMO bulletin comes out just a week or so before climate negotiators begin at the COP24 meeting in Katowice, Poland, where countries will discuss putting the Paris climate agreement into practice and increasing their ambitions when it comes to cutting warming gases.\n\n\"The new IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C shows that deep and rapid reductions of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases will be needed in all sectors of society and the economy,\" said IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee.\n\n\"The WMO greenhouse gas bulletin, showing a continuing rising trend in concentrations of greenhouse gases, underlines just how urgent these emissions reductions are.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "2018/11/22 09:00 GMT", "description": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w172w4f3dw3zxwj", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p060dh18.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T09:06:00Z", "content": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "fulltext": "Sign in to the BBC, or Register"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "John Allen Chau 'tribal death': Family forgives killers", "description": "In a statement, his family says John Allen Chau had 'nothing but love for the Sentinelese people'.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-46300459", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2BA5/production/_104437111_capaf324324ture.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T09:05:53Z", "content": "Image copyright Instagram/John Chau Image caption On 21 October, @johnachau posted that he was travelling to the region The family of a US man reportedly killed by arrows fired by members of an endangered tribe in India's Andaman and Nicobar islands has said \u2026 [+3469 chars]", "fulltext": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Who are the Sentinelese?\n\nThe family of a US man reportedly killed by arrows fired by members of an endangered tribe in India's Andaman and Nicobar islands have said they forgive those who killed him.\n\nIn a statement, they said John Allen Chau \"loved God, life, helping those in need, and had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people\".\n\nSeven people who helped him reach North Sentinel island have been arrested.\n\nThe Indian authorities say it may take \"some days\" to recover Mr Chau's body.\n\nA missionary who was in contact with Mr Chau in the last days of his trip says his aim was to bring the gospel to the island's tribesmen.\n\nOutsiders are banned from even approaching the island to protect the people who live there, and their way of life.\n\nThe complete isolation of the Sentinelese people means contact with the outside world could put them at risk, as they are likely to have no immunity to even common illnesses such as flu and measles.\n\nMr Chau's family released a statement on Instagram, saying he had gone to the island of \"his own free will\".\n\n\"We also ask for the release of those friends he had in the Andaman Islands.

If I would not be able to drive competitively enough, I would not be here.\n\n\"It is a normal way of thinking that people see my limitations and ask how it is possible I can do it, and I know it is hard to believe.\n\n\"But Williams has seen it this year and I have seen it in the last 16 or 18 months since I first drove an F1 car in Valencia last year that I can do it, thanks to work, but also that my limitations are not limiting me as most people are thinking.\"\n\nDeputy team principal Claire Williams said: \"It is a great credit to his strength of character and tenacity to return to Formula 1. He has a level of determination that is remarkable to see.\"\n\nHow Kubica's career came off the rails\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Archive: Kubica's remarkable return to Formula 1\n\nKubica was poised to start a second season with Renault in 2011 when he crashed on a rally in northern Italy in February.\n\nHis car was penetrated by a road-side barrier and as well as inflicting multiple fracture and injuries on the right-hand side of his body, it also almost severed his arm.\n\nFor a time, his life was in danger, but Kubica started a long process of rehabilitation aimed at returning to the sport.\n\nFor several years, he felt he did not have enough movement in his arm to race in single-seaters, and he competed for three years in the World Rally Championship.\n\nHe then tried a series of different racing cars to see if he could be competitive in them, and a turning point came at the end of 2016 when he tried a simulator at the factory of Italian racing car constructor Dallara, and realised a return to F1 might now be possible.\n\nIn 2017, he conducted a series of tests with Renault, who eventually passed on the opportunity to sign him, and then began talks with Williams, who were poised to sign him for 2018 before a last-minute change of heart.\n\nWhy now and not last year?\n\nKubica's right arm clearly bears the scars of his accident\n\nKubica and Russian Sergey Sirotkin tested together post-season in Abu Dhabi last November and Sirotkin proved quicker after the team had analysed their performances closely. Added to the fact that the Russian could supply more than twice as much funding for the team, the decision to pick Sirotkin felt to them to be simple.\n\nHowever, Sirotkin's performances in his debut season have not lived up to expectations, either of the team or his Russian backers, and he had much less money available for 2020.\n\nAt the same time, Kubica has continued to impress, running in three free practice sessions before Abu Dhabi, a number of tests and setting quick times in the team's simulator. Added to funding from Poland said to be worth at least 10m euros, the balance has swung in his favour.\n\nForce India driver and Mercedes protege Esteban Ocon was an option but Mercedes were not prepared to release the Frenchman for more than a year, while Williams wanted a driver it could potentially keep for longer.\n\nWilliams said: \"Robert has done a great job for the team this year. He has pushed really hard in the reserve driver role and done some great work on the race track.\n\n\"Next year is a new start for Williams and I have spent a lot of time with Robert over the course of this year and I have really enjoyed his company. But just his fighting spirit, we need that in this team at the moment.\n\n\"And we need everybody pushing and I think Robert is going to be a really great addition for us for 2019 and beyond.\"\n\nHow does he drive with one arm?\n\nAfter a run at the Spanish Grand Prix in May, Kubica said he \"could make a comeback now\" if he was given the chance.\n\nRobert Kubica in Formula 1 One race win: 2008 Canadian Grand Prix\n\nOne pole position: 2008 Bahrain GP\n\nFour full seasons as F1 driver\n\nTeams raced for: BMW Sauber and Renault\n\nLast race: 2010 Abu Dhabi GP\n\nHe added: \"Whatever is missing is only a question because I am doing it every two months - if something is missing.\n\n\"If I had a chance to drive every week, there is even more room to improve.\"\n\nIn-car footage from Kubica's car in practice sessions this year has made it clear that he is still unable to grip the steering wheel with his right hand.\n\nKubica explains that he has adapted to what he calls his \"limitations\" and has discovered that he does not necessarily need to hold the wheel tight with both hands to drive.\n\n\"After my accident, I discovered that to do a roundabout in the road car, you don't have to grab the steering wheel, you can use friction to turn.\n\n\"F1 is not a road car, but I have been also in school where they give you a bird in the hand and you have to hold it [so] that it doesn't fly away but you cannot hold it too much that it gets scared. This is the way you have to hold the steering wheel.\n\n\"Then, that it looks different than 10 years ago and to the others, I know. But the outcome is probably the same or nearly the same.\"\n\nThere inevitably remain question marks about his absolute pace on track until it is proven, as well as the level of Williams' competitiveness after the worst season in their history, but for now F1 has a heart-warming story of courage and redemption to take it into the winter after this weekend's final race in Abu Dhabi.\n\nReaction to Kubica return\n\nBritain's George Russell will partner Kubica at Williams in 2019\n\nHaas driver Grosjean welcomes Kubica back"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Chelsea Clinton: 'No-one asked dad to change his name'", "description": "The daughter of former US politicians Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton says public expectations differed for each of her parents.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46293506", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AD87/production/_104432444_chelseaclintonheadshot.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T08:47:44Z", "content": "Image copyright Chelsea Clinton Chelsea Clinton has said the public's expectations of her mother were \"very different\" compared to her father.

academic jailed for spying in the United Arab Emirates says the British government put UK interests above his right to freedom.\n\nDaniela Tejada spoke to the BBC shortly after returning to the UK from Abu Dhabi where she saw Durham University's Matthew Hedges sentenced to life.\n\nThe 31-year-old denies spying but prosecutors said he had confessed.\n\nMs Tejada has arrived for a meeting in London with the Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt.\n\nMr Hunt met the UAE ambassador in London earlier for \"a very frank conversation\" and Prime Minister Theresa May said she was \"deeply concerned\" by the situation, which was \"being raised at the highest level\" in the UAE.\n\nHedges, who is originally from Exeter, said he had been in the country conducting research on the UAE's security strategy for his PhD thesis when he was arrested at Dubai airport on 5 May.\n\nImage copyright David Mirzoeff/PA Image caption Daniela Tejada met Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt to discuss her husband's case\n\nAccording to the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner, sources in the UAE claim \"espionage material\" was found on Hedges' laptop.\n\nHowever, Mr Hunt has insisted there was no basis for the spy charges.\n\nMs Tejada told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office had been \"stepping on eggshells instead of taking a firm stance\" and only began to take her husband's case seriously once he had been released on bail on 29 October after enduring months of solitary confinement.\n\n\"I was under the impression they were putting their interests with the UAE above a British citizen's rightful freedom and welfare,\" Ms Tejada said.\n\n'Unacceptable conditions'\n\nShe said she had contacted the Foreign Office \"on a weekly basis\" since her husband's arrest in May.\n\n\"They just disregarded my requests, they said it wasn't part of their job, it wasn't part of their duty,\" she continued.\n\n\"On one occasion, one of the case workers said the Foreign Office did not have a duty of care so weren't obliged to make such representations.\"\n\nImage copyright Daniela Tejada/PA Wire Image caption Ms Tejada said she felt the Foreign

\"heart goes out\" to Hedges and his family but that Mr Hunt had \"raised this case personally with the crown prince on 12 November\".\n\nHe told Today: \"The Foreign Office has been acting on (Hedges') behalf at the highest possible levels.\"\n\nFollowing a question in the House Lords, Baroness Goldie (Conservative) said consulate staff had met Hedges on six occasions, \"three before his recent bail and three whilst on bail\".\n\nShe said Mr Hunt was also \"urgently seeking a call\" with the UAE's Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed.\n\nMs Tejada said she had been unable to speak to her husband since he was sentenced but she could \"imagine he is just as distraught as I am\".\n\n\"He was very, very scared standing in front of the judge,\" she said, because he was aware of the possibility of receiving an arbitrary judgement.\n\n\"I asked him to look at me if he was feeling too nervous and he tried to do so on a couple of occasions but was asked to face the judge.\"\n\nShe said Hedges was shaking when the translator told him the sentence and \"asked to double check if he had heard it right\".\n\nImage copyright EPA/DANIELA TEJADA Image caption Matthew Hedges was arrested in the UAE in May\n\nMs Tejada said there had been no due process, adding: \"He was put through so much strain for six months that absolutely nothing he said or did could be used against him.\n\n\"Anything used against Matt is completely unfounded.\"\n\nMr Hedges' family claim he signed a document written in Arabic - a language he cannot speak or read - that later transpired to be a confession.\n\n'Fair and transparent trial'\n\nThis came after he was interrogated without a lawyer or consular help, his family added.\n\nMs Tejada later told Reuters: \"Handing a life sentence to an innocent researcher who held the UAE in high regard speaks volumes about their lack of tolerance and respect for human life.\"\n\nUAE Attorney General Dr Hamad Saif Al Shamsi said Hedges had \"confessed in detail to his crimes\" and was \"accorded full rights\" with a \"fair and transparent trial\".\n\nAbdulla Al Naqbi, head of the Department of Legal Affairs for the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs, added: \"Compelling and powerful evidence was presented in court. That included information extracted from his personal electronic devices by expert forensic analysis techniques, evidence provided by UAE intelligence agencies, witness testaments and Mr Hedges' own confession.\n\n\"The case was heard by three judges in the security division of the Higher Federal Court who met a total of four times. In the first session on 3 October Mr Hedges was asked whether he had proper representation and was offered the services of a court-appointed lawyer, which he accepted.\n\n\"It is not true that he was asked to sign documents he did not understand.\"\n\nThe ministry said the UAE was \"determined to protect its important strategic relationship with a key ally\" and added that it hoped both sides could find \"an amicable solution\" to the case.\"\n\nThe UAE attorney general previously said the sentence - which could see the academic serve up to 25 years in jail before being deported - was not final as he had the right to appeal.\n\nAnalysis: Sending a spy 'makes no sense'\n\nFrank Gardner, security correspondent, BBC News\n\nBritain has a very deep and quite long-standing defence relationship with the UAE - it is an ally.\n\nThere are roughly 200 serving British personnel permanently based in the UAE. There is an airbase called Al Minhad just south of Dubai where RAF Typhoons and Tornadoes are rotating in and out, including for flights to Afghanistan. There is a port called Port Zayed which is the most visited Royal Navy port in the world. And hundreds of Emirati officers are trained at Sandhurst military academy.\n\nBritain has got a very close defence, security and counter-terrorism relationship with the UAE and though there is no suggestion of that being threatened, if the situation escalates, the calls to reconsider that relationship will increase.\n\nThe suggestion Britain would send a spy makes no sense. I'm sure MI6 would use academics to spy on a place if they could, but only in hard-to-target countries. I cannot imagine what an academic could get out of the UAE that the UK couldn't get by asking the UAE directly.\n\nThere is nothing I can see that Matthew Hedges has done which in any way would constitute spying. There are far greater sensitivities there than in this country - somebody has reported him to the authorities saying he is asking suspicious questions.\n\nI've known someone, who was a businessman in Dubai - a former British army officer - who was arrested because he upset the wrong person and didn't have the connections that would get him out of jail.\n\nProf Clive Jones, Hedges' supervisor at Durham University, said there would now have to be \"some kind of moratorium\" on sending students to do field work in the UAE and the wider Gulf region.\n\nHe said Hedges had been looking at civil-military relations in the UAE since the Arab Spring and \"there was nothing clandestine or covert\" about the material he had.\n\nProf Jones said there had been no \"inkling\" of any danger and Hedges was \"no stranger\" to the UAE, having \"lived there on and off\" since he was nine years old.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Shana Marshall, a friend of Matthew Hedges, says she is \"shocked\" at the UAE's verdict\n\nProf Jones said: \"He knew many of the people he was going out to interview, so again it is utterly bizarre, and indeed perverse, and indeed a miscarriage of justice, that this has befallen him.\"\n\nConservative MP and former soldier Johnny Mercer said it would be \"absolutely disgraceful\" if Ms Tejada's claims were found to be true, adding: \"We have no interests with the UAE that outweigh the rights and freedoms of our citizens abroad.\"\n\nHe earlier said the case was \"unacceptable\" and \"consequences must be immediate until he is released\"."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "California wildfires: Rain brings threat of mudslides", "description": "The rainfall is helping to contain the deadly fires, but is expected to complicate recovery efforts.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46300309", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/284A/production/_104441301_mediaitem104441300.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T08:46:04Z", "content": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption The rain is expected to hamper recovery efforts in fire-ravaged areas such as Paradise Rain has come to northern California, helping to contain deadly wildfires but bringing fears of mudslides that may complicate recovery\u2026 [+3114 chars]", "fulltext": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The rain is expected to hamper recovery efforts in fire-ravaged areas such as Paradise\n\nRain has come to northern California, helping to contain deadly wildfires but bringing fears of mudslides that may complicate recovery efforts.\n\nSome four to six inches of rain (10-15cm) are expected to fall in the coming days, and some areas have been warned to prepare for flash flooding.\n\nAt least 80 people died in the fires that swept across the state.\n\nMore than 500 people remain unaccounted for after the so-called Camp Fire destroyed the town of Paradise.\n\nWorkers have been combing through the debris from more than 10,000 homes that were burned down by the fire.\n\nThe rain that began to fall on Wednesday is the first significant downpour for the state in about six months.\n\nIt came as a relief to those less affected by the fires.

More than half of all households in Britain are on default tariffs because they have never switched or have not done so recently.\n\nThe cap is due to be reviewed in February, and then be adjusted in April and October each year.\n\nOfgem has already said that the level of the cap is likely to rise in April 2019, to reflect the higher cost of wholesale energy.

Earlier this month, the 42-year-old was appointed manager of Albion Rovers, the club currently bottom of Scotland's League Two. It made him the first black, Asian or minority ethnic boss of a Scottish club since Marcio Maximo left Livingston in October 2003.\n\n\"In any other walk of life, if there wasn't a black or ethnic minority in a particular industry or company for 15 years, there would be uproar,\" Harper says. \"Should football be different?\"\n\nIn this interview with BBC Sport Scotland, the former Hibernian, Derby and Portsmouth winger talks about being rejected for \"30 or 40\" jobs, being racially abused as a teenager and the pressure of being a black manager.\n\n'Maybe they think there's no point'\n\nBefore Brazilian Maximo's four-month tenure, the only black, Asian or minority ethnic managers to have taken charge of Scottish teams were Dave Smith at Montrose, John Barnes at Celtic and Claude Anelka - who appointed himself at Raith Rovers.\n\nThe last Scottish government census in 2011 found that 4% of the population are non-white. Yet, at the last count, 6% of the 10,000 registered Scottish FA coaches fell into that category.\n\nHarper, though, remains unconvinced. He estimates that he has applied for between 30 and 40 coaching jobs at all levels of the Scottish game in the past five years but has not once been invited for interview. Only three clubs extended him the courtesy of a rejection letter.\n\n\"I imagine a lot of people would get disheartened,\" says Harper, who has been working as a recruitment consultant for the past five months. \"And maybe that's it. Maybe black and ethnic coaches think 'what's the point?'.\n\n\"I'm not for a minute saying black or ethnic coaches deserve an interview purely because of their colour. And I wasn't the best candidate in all of those cases.\n\n\"But, when you look at CVs, there's a least half of those jobs, in my opinion, that I should have been interviewed for.\"\n\nMarcio Maximo (second right) had four months as Livingston manager in 2003\n\n'Players are still racially abused'\n\nThe most recent accusation of racism in Scottish football was anti-Irish against Hibernian head coach Neil Lennon at the Edinburgh derby last month.\n\nHarper has huge sympathy for the former Celtic boss and insists racial abuse from the stands in Scotland still happens far too often.\n\n\"Players still get it. That's a fact,\" he says. \"It's changed a hell of a lot, but we've not come far enough. Are we ever going to have a time when there is nobody in a stand or on the side of a pitch who is going to say something? I don't think so.\"\n\nHarper speaks from bitter experience. He says he was racially abused by opponents in the professional game but can also vividly recall the bile spat at him from the sidelines in his formative years in the game.\n\n\"Any game I went to, I'd be racially abused as a 10, 11, 12, 13 year old,\" he says. \"But I don't believe everyone who says something like that is racist - it's the easy word to come out with. We need to educate people and make them understand that it's unacceptable and I don't think we do that enough.\"\n\n'This isn't going to open the floodgates'\n\nHarper played with the likes of Paul Merson at Portsmouth\n\nHarper has done plenty of learning himself over the past 20-odd years.\n\nThe explosive, dreadlocked talent who broke through at Hibs, went on to spend nine years in the English second-tier with Derby County, Portsmouth and Stoke City.\n\nHe claimed three championship medals in the process and played under managers such as Tony Pulis, Steve McClaren and Harry Redknapp - and alongside the likes of Teddy Sheringham, Robert Prosinecki and Paul Merson.\n\nThose relationships and experiences will inform his managerial style, which Harper describes as \"methodical, calm... but I can lose the head at times\".\n\nSo too will a short stint in the Australian third tier, where he was technical director of a club as well as first-team and under-18s manager - a set up that is likely to mirror the all-encompassing nature of his role with Albion Rovers.\n\nBut few of his contemporaries in Scotland's League Two will have the same attention and expectation on them as Harper does. Not that he feels it.\n\n\"If Albion Rovers had appointed a white manager, I don't think there would have been the interest. But do I feel more pressure because I'm black? No. The pressure for me is to keep the club in the league,\" says Harper, who lost his first game in charge against Berwick Rangers on Saturday.\n\n\"If I do well, it might help others, but I don't think me being at Albion Rovers or keeping them up is going to open the floodgates for black and ethnic managers to take over, so to speak.\n\n\"That said, if one person wants to become a coach or a manager because of me, that's perfect.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "England's Poulter and Hatton in joint lead at World Cup", "description": "England's Tyrrell Hatton and Ian Poulter hold a share of the lead after the first round of the World Cup of Golf in Australia.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/golf/46300011", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/296C/production/_104440601_hatton_poulter_epa.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T07:37:34Z", "content": "Poulter (left) and Hatton were both part of Europe's victorious Ryder Cup team World Cup of Golf leaderboard -10 Australia, England, South Korea; -9 Belgium, Denmark, Malaysia; -8 Ireland, India Selected others: -6 United States Full leaderboard England's Tyr\u2026 [+1171 chars]", "fulltext": "Poulter (left) and Hatton were both part of Europe's victorious Ryder Cup team\n\nWorld Cup of Golf leaderboard -10 Australia, England, South Korea; -9 Belgium, Denmark, Malaysia; -8 Ireland, India Selected others:-6 United States Full leaderboard\n\nEngland's Tyrrell Hatton and Ian Poulter hold a share of the lead after the first round of the World Cup of Golf in Australia.\n\nIn the opening round of fourballs, the pair shot a bogey-free 10-under par round of 62 in Melbourne.\n\nThey are level with Australia's Marc Leishman and Cameron Smith as well as South Korean duo Kim Si-woo and An Byeong-hun.\n\nThe two-man teams compete in alternate shot foursomes in Friday's round two.\n\nAustralia have been paired with England on Friday, one day before both countries meet in a rugby union match at Twickenham.\n\n\"You've got the Ashes and the rugby and all that,\" said Smith. \"So yeah, there is a rivalry.

We believe a cap is the only intervention that will effectively tackle the highest prices.\"\n\nHow much will consumers save?\n\nThe FCA says the cap could save about 400,000 consumers up to \u00a322.7m a year.\n\nIn a series of examples, someone who buys a Hotpoint cooker on a rent-to-own basis could save as much as \u00a3606 over a three-year period, or \u00a33.88 a week.\n\nSomeone buying an Indesit fridge freezer through rent-to-own could save \u00a3360 a year, or \u00a32.31 a week.\n\nHow have rent-to-own shops reacted?\n\nThe main providers of rent-to-own goods are Brighthouse and PerfectHome.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nA BrightHouse spokesman said: \"BrightHouse has been working closely and constructively with the FCA over a number of years.

Should Barca give the armband to somebody else? Messi is obviously a great player\u2026but is he a poor captain?\n\nMaradona leads the complaints\n\nPredictably, many of the fiercest criticisms of Messi's leadership attributes have come from Argentina, where he has struggled to command the universal affection he enjoys in Barcelona.\n\nMost recently, national icon Diego Maradona used a bizarre television interview with Fox Sports as an opportunity to lambast Messi's captaincy of the national team, which he has held since 2011.\n\n\"It's useless to make a leader out of someone who goes to the toilet 20 times before a game,\" said Maradona. \"Rather than talking with his team-mates he'll play video games.\"\n\nMaradona's words were soon shot down. The defence of Messi was led by another Argentine World Cup-winning hero, Mario Kempes.\n\n\"Every time Diego opens his mouth it's a problem because he doesn't respect people,\" retorted Kempes. \"Diego's time has passed, and neither is he a good example to say such things.\"\n\nIt is, indeed, increasingly difficult to take Maradona seriously. But he did spend nearly two years working directly with Messi during an ill-fated stint as Argentina coach (2008-2010), so his argument carries some weight.\n\nAnd Maradona is not alone. Another former Argentina skipper, Daniel Passarella, has also argued that Messi is not suited to captaincy, saying: \"The leader of the group is different to the way you play. I admire Messi but his personality is withdrawn and timid.\"\n\nMessi certainly doesn't fit the traditional mould of a captain: the boisterous and charismatic extrovert who leads his team with exuberant enthusiasm. So are Maradona and Passarella right?\n\nMaradona was Messi's coach during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, where Argentina reached the quarter-finals\n\nMore mature and self-confident: the new Messi\n\nPassarella's argument is more sensible than Maradona's, but you will not find anyone in Barcelona who agrees with it. As far as everyone there is concerned, Messi is the team's undisputed leader.\n\nThe key to that belief is the way in which Messi has changed over the years. He has become more confident and comfortable in his own skin, progressing far from the timid teenager who was so quiet that some of his team-mates initially wondered whether he was mute.\n\nAlbert Masnou, deputy editor of Barcelona-based daily newspaper Sport, believes Messi has undergone a remarkable personal transformation.\n\n\"Something really noticeable is Leo's increased maturity,\" said Masnou. \"Now, Leo does everything with a naturalness which can amaze those who used to consider him timid or introverted.\n\n\"He has been growing and maturing, and you can see that on and off the field. I don't think captaincy has changed him, but he has assumed the role with great maturity.\"\n\nThis has been a natural growing-up process for Messi: a shy boy in a foreign land gradually maturing into a confident adult with a wife and children, most career objectives already achieved and a strong sense of his place in the world.\n\nMessi's ex-international team-mate Pablo Zabaleta agrees with Masnou's assessment, believing his old friend is now perfectly suited to the demands of captaining Barca.\n\n\"When you are a captain, you have responsibilities to welcome everyone,\" Zabaleta stated in my book, Lionel Messi and the Art of Living. \"Leo does that more naturally now because he is more mature.\n\n\"He's not a kid any more - in fact he's the father of his own three kids! He's grown up, and he's also a family man who knows how to treat people like a family.\"\n\nStill understated, but more assertive\n\nMalcom has made just five competitive appearances for Barcelona since completing his \u00a336.5m move from Bordeaux\n\nMessi's newfound maturity manifests itself in a more assertive manner, an ability to express himself more confidently and clearly.\n\nHe still conducts media interviews relatively rarely, but he speaks more than previously and is no longer the tongue-tied youngster who struggled to string two sentences together.\n\nMasnou believes Messi's reticence gives him a greater sense of authority when he does talk, noting: \"When he speaks, it's because he's really got something to say and everyone listens to him. What he says is meaningful.\"\n\nAn example came in August, when Messi was required to deliver a traditional pre-season speech to fans before a friendly against Boca Juniors.\n\nRather than issuing the bland platitudes expected from a supposedly meek introvert, Messi instead made a bold pledge: \"Last season was really good as we did the double but we all felt bad about how it went in the Champions League. We promise this season we will do everything we can to bring that beautiful trophy back to the Nou Camp.\"\n\nThat speech made a huge impression among fans, immediately becoming a rallying cry. Masnou notes with particular surprise that \"nobody prepared the speech for him\u2026he improvised it,\" and they absolutely weren't the words of a man who shies away from leadership.\n\nIncreasingly, the same kind of purposeful assertiveness is being seen behind the scenes. A couple of weeks ago, for instance, Messi approached Barca coach Ernesto Valverde to ask why Malcom, a summer signing from Bordeaux, had not been receiving more playing time.\n\nValverde responded by introducing Malcom from the bench during the Champions League game at Inter Milan for his first appearance since September. Two minutes later, the Brazilian scored with his first touch.\n\nLeading by example\n\nAs far as his team-mates are concerned, perhaps the most significant aspect of Messi wearing the skipper's armband is a subtler form of captaincy: leading by example.\n\nZabaleta has the unique distinction of both captaining and being captained by Messi during their 11 years together with Argentina's youth and senior international teams, and he believes Messi's presence alone makes him a worthy leader.\n\n\"If I see Leo Messi is showing me his ambition to win, that's inspiring,\" he said. \"If the best player in the world is producing his best in every game, then every single player needs to do the same. You follow people like that.\"\n\nMessi has won 33 trophies with Barcelona and is the club's record goalscorer\n\nWinger Malcom concurs, telling ESPN Brazil: \"He always wants the best for the group. This is why he's captain and someone who can inspire players to give their best. Coming from someone who has five Ballon d'Or awards, you're motivated.\"\n\nRight now, this is all particularly pertinent for Ousmane Dembele. The French winger, 21, is struggling to translate his undoubted talent into effective performances, and a stream of disciplinary issues are seriously testing Barca's patience.\n\nOne train of thought argues that Messi, as club captain, should personally intervene, setting Dembele on the right path with some well-chosen words of reprimand and encouragement.\n\nBut although Dembele needs help from others, he also needs to help himself. And there would surely be no better way of learning how to convert his youthful talent into a successful career than emulating the example set by his captain, right in front of his eyes.\n\nMessi is not the type to motivate the likes of Dembele through rousing speeches or kick-up-the-backside sermons. But Dembele doesn't need to listen to Messi; he just needs to watch him.

In his prime, Townsend played 10, but he also played in the midfield, albeit mostly at 13 as opposed to 12, where Russell is going to operate.\n\nHe belonged to a different era, of course. Rugby has changed profoundly since his time. What's never going to change, though, is Townsend's desire to try new things in the search for a better formula.\n\nHis changes in the centre positions have gone from Chris Harris and Huw Jones in the first game of the year against Wales in the Principality Stadium, to Jones and Pete Horne for the three Tests that followed, to Jones and Nick Grigg in Italy.\n\nTownsend has tinkered in part through form, injury and a desire to rest over-worked players and have a look at new combinations. Harris and James Lang started against Canada in Edmonton, Grigg and Horne began against United States in Houston and against Argentina in Resistencia.\n\nOnwards into this autumn, when Alex Dunbar and Jones started against Wales before making way for Jones and Horne against South Africa and now Jones and Russell against the Pumas on Saturday.\n\nWith Adam Hastings playing fly-half, Russell becomes the eighth centre that Townsend has selected in those run of games - and that's not counting the injured group of Matt Scott, Mark Bennett, Sam Johnson and Duncan Taylor.\n\nYou sense that his first-choice pairing would be Jones and Horne, but others have a chance of changing that. If Taylor can overcome any injury curse, he'll come rocketing back into the equation.\n\nIf the axis of Hastings and Russell - twin playmakers and all the attacking options they might bring - happens to work on Saturday then Townsend will have further thinking to do as he heads into the Six Nations.\n\n\"The selection has evolved more because of circumstances with other players,\" Townsend said of Russell's switch, something which happened in the latter stages of the win over Fiji and defeat by South Africa.\n\n\"Given that we have had injuries and that Finn and Adam have combined well in the games that they've played, we believe it's a good time to see how they go against Argentina.\n\n\"It will be an exciting prospect for Adam. He'll have two strong communicators either side of him, someone who plays regularly at 10 on his shoulder and someone who has played a lot of matches for Scotland and captained Scotland on a number of occasions inside him.\"\n\nPeter Horne and Huw Jones were Scotland's preferred pairing in the defeat by South African\n\nTownsend was referring to scrum-half Greig Laidlaw and Russell, two men with vast experience and who could be cast in the role of Hastings' mentors on the day. Although the coach is experimenting a little with his line-up, there's no escaping the importance of this game in momentum terms.\n\nScotland have lost two Tests this autumn that they should really have won - away to Wales and at home to South Africa on Saturday. A win against the Pumas would make it two wins from four. A loss would make it one from four - a worrying return heading into the Six Nations and a World Cup year.\n\n\"There are things we learned down in Cardiff and again last week, so we'd like to believe we're a better team going into this weekend's game,\" Townsend said.\n\n\"What really excited us about Adam going into the Wales game was the work-rate he has shown for Glasgow and his games for Scotland in the summer.\n\n\"We're looking for the same from Finn in a different role this week, so he's going to have to work really hard in defence as well as attack. We should see other aspects of his game. Finn is a strong ball-carrier, he's hard to put down, he's got a good offloading game, he's got a good awareness of defences to pick the right running lines.\"\n\nRussell's reaction to being named at 12? \"He seemed OK, yeah,\" Townsend added. \"He's enjoyed the parts of the game where he and Adam have played together.\n\n\"Every selection has an unknown quality about it, but every selection is about putting a team out there that we believe gives us the best chance of winning.\n\n\"If this had been a Six Nations game, it might not have been the selection we put out there. But, if they go well, it could be the selection we put out there for a Six Nations game next year.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "News Daily: 'One in 200' homeless and type 2 diabetes rise", "description": "Your morning briefing for 22 November 2018.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46295989", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/EF07/production/_99719116_miltonkeynes2.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T06:29:45Z", "content": "If you want to get this briefing by email, sign up here 'A perfect storm' One in every 200 Britons is either sleeping rough or living in temporary accommodation, such as hostels and B&amp;Bs.

The research also shows that universities can have very different levels of dependency on the current \u00a39,250 annual tuition fees. Tuition fees were only 15% of income for Cambridge, but at Falmouth it was 83% and Nottingham Trent was 81%.\n\nRead the full article\n\nWhat the papers say\n\nThere's condemnation in many papers of the treatment of the British academic jailed in the United Arab Emirates for spying.

If you do not do a good season people will say the rest of the things you did before were useless because you didn't make it in England, but that triggered me and that's the challenge I wanted.\n\n\"I went against everyone and said that's what I wanted to do. They thought I was too old, I was 35 and I made the Premier League look old. It took me three months to convince everyone who I was. That was the challenge and I never turn down a challenge.\"\n\nJose Mourinho called Ibrahimovic \"an extension of my right arm\"\n\nOn Paul Pogba and the Premier League\n\n\"I miss all of them. I had a fantastic time at United. Wazza [Wayne Rooney], Michael Carrick, then the young guys that wanted to show the world who they are by playing football and they had a lot of hunger to show. I had a good time because I got to know everyone, I was the mature guy with all these guys who were not mature.\n\n\"Paul Pogba, I had never played with him before and I didn't know him as a person. We have the same management and when I got to know him I got to find a fantastic person and a fantastic footballer, but someone who needs to be guided.\n\n\"He is a professional guy that works every game and never misses training or a game. Those are all the things that people do not see, you only get judged by what you can see on television or the 90 minutes in the stadium, that's where you have to perform.\n\n\"When you click with someone it just clicks. The connection on the field was amazing, we helped each other very well, I needed him and he needed me. The first year at United we had a fantastic year.\n\n\"They made me feel like Benjamin Button. I was getting younger and younger, then unfortunately I got my injury.\n\n\"The Premier League should be happy I did not come 10 years ago because it would've been a different story. You see all my numbers [of goals] and all of these numbers would've been in the Premier League. I came to the right club in United. It was the club and the shirt that I was supposed to shine in and I did it.\"\n\nOn injury\n\nIbrahimovic suffered a serious knee injury in a Europa League game against Anderlecht in April 2017\n\n\"When it happened I did not understand what I was going through, I had never had a serious injury. I was like Superman, I was unbreakable and no-one could break me, only Zlatan could injure Zlatan.\n\n\"I said, 'This is not the way I want to stop playing football. The way I walked in is the way I will walk out, not by limping or someone saying it's over'. This was a new challenge for me and I said I would come back when I was ready and I would play exactly as I did before. When I cannot do that I will not continue in football because I'm not here for charity.\n\n\"After my injury, when I was selected, I said to Jose Mourinho, 'I do not want to disappoint you or my team-mates. You had a Zlatan before the injury and you had one after the injury and I cannot give you the Zlatan that you are used to, that's why I will not give you this Zlatan because I'm not ready.'\n\n\"My second year at United, I was not feeling ready, I was feeling different, it was like I was starting at zero and I had to teach my knee how to play football again. After a while my confidence grew, I needed a new environment to feel that I was comfortable.\"\n\nOn life in LA\n\nIbrahimovic has been a hit with MLS fans\n\n\"We [Ibrahimovic and his wife] had talked about it and she said one day I would like to see how it is to live in LA, that was one of the many factors when I chose LA. LA did not choose me, I chose LA.\n\n\"They are happy to be here, there's less stress, if I can be negative the time difference is too big because of all my family from Sweden and I only have a short time to connect with them.\"\n\nOn arriving in LA, Ibrahimovic took out a full-page advert in the LA Times which read, \"Dear Los Angeles. You're welcome\".\n\n\"I felt I was giving them something they did not have before and I gave myself as a present to them. They did understand what I was and all the things I said would happen. It took 10 minutes to present myself in a way I did in my first game at the Galaxy and they understood what I had given them.\"\n\nOn his feet\n\nAn image of Ibrahimovic's feet is included in his book I Am Football\n\n\"My wife does not allow me to have pictures of myself. She says, 'There is already enough talk of you and I don't want to see you on the walls, it is enough that I see you in real life'.\n\n\"There is one of my feet on the wall. That is what has given us what we have, it is a reminder for the family, not for me, of what we have. That is what has created the whole situation, the whole buzz around me - the two feet.\n\n\"I play this beautiful sport with my feet. Even if it is ugly toes, we don't care - we put it on the wall just as a reminder, we have food to eat thanks to those feet so you should kiss those feet every day - no, I'm joking. Every footballer's toes and feet around the world are ugly - there is no beautiful out there.\"\n\nOn Planet Zlatan\n\n\"I came from my own planet, with something that no one has seen. I'm a guy from this area that they think is the ghetto. They saw me differently, they did not make me feel welcome, they did not make me feel like everyone else, but I came with something else and now they follow that. I came from my own planet - Planet Zlatan.\"\n\nListen to the full 'Zlatan is Football Daily' podcast on BBC Sounds"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "FA Cup: Watch all the best goals from first-round replays", "description": "Watch some of the best goals from the FA Cup first-round replays, including a lovely lob from Barnet's Craig Robson and a superb strike from Doncaster's John Marquis.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/46298346", "urlToImage": "https://m.files.bbci.co.uk/modules/bbc-morph-sport-page/2.5.5/images/bbc-sport-logo.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T06:18:13Z", "content": "Watch some of the best goals from the FA Cup first-round replays, including a lovely lob from Barnet's Craig Robson and a superb strike from Doncaster's John Marquis.

The GRU has been linked to Russia's military operation in eastern Ukraine, to Moscow's meddling in the US election and to a failed coup in Montenegro.\n\nThe defence ministry described Korobov as a \"wonderful person\". But 2018 has been less than wonderful for the agency he headed. A series of botched operations - most notably the Salisbury poisoning - has thrust the GRU into the limelight and raised questions about its methods and activities.\n\nKorobov reportedly died \"after a long, extended illness\". Did he fall ill, as rumours suggest, after a dressing-down from the president? I can't confirm that.\n\nBut what's clear is that if you take on the role of GRU chief, don't expect a carriage clock and a happy retirement at the end of it.

A real pleasure to meet her and obviously a first-class brain there. I found it hard to keep up, actually.\n\nHow was your date? Lively stuff - it did me a lot of good to be exposed to someone who was deeply committed to the Brexit deal.\n\nWhat was the best thing about the date? The sausages were very good.\n\nWhat was the worst thing? Possibly being forced to concentrate for about two hours.\n\nWhat did you talk about? I argued that during my time in the EU, it was in a way quite exciting to be able to use the EU mechanisms to drive through projects and programmes and political decisions which it might have been harder to get through if you just worked at a national level, country by country.\n\nWhat was her most convincing argument? She did convince me that there are a lot of people out there who take Brexit very seriously indeed - it's not just a political football to be kicked around. Even if it did come to a second vote...

We both agreed that what has happened to Brexit is a terrible sham.\n\nWhat was your biggest disagreement? We really disagreed on immigration and not how you'd think because I'm very pro-immigration and Stanley is quite anti it because he is very concerned about population growth. In another discussion, about immigration, we may not have got along as well as we did.\n\nDid he convince you on anything? No, but that's not because he wasn't thoughtful but because I think that this debate is the centre of my political outlook, so it would take more than an earthquake to change my mind on this.\n\nImage caption Stanley insists to Ella that he pays for their meal\n\nWould you see him again?

In some, the symptoms only appear years later.\n\nOn Remembrance Day in 2015, Phillip Riding, had been out of the military for one month. He went to the Cenotaph as a civilian, with his medals from Afghanistan pinned to a white shirt, and sang God Save the Queen with the crowd.\n\nIn the silence afterwards, a bugle sounded The Last Post. And in that moment, suddenly the memories of Afghanistan came flooding back.\n\n\"Something inside had snapped. I couldn't breathe, I was panicking standing there in the ceremony with tears rolling down my face,\" Riding says. \"That sound of the bugle reminded me of the moment it was announced every time a comrade was lost.\"\n\nFriends, killed or injured, flashed in front of his eyes: Bing from artillery, Tres shot in the ankle, Rocco, Plant, Coops, LJ shot in the shoulder, Jordan\u2026.\n\nFor five years he had been suppressing these thoughts.\n\n\"I thought I was fine but all of a sudden I wasn't any more. That door I kept shut, opened completely. This is how PTSD is, it's something that creeps up on you. It just totally destroyed me.\"\n\nRiding joined the Army in August 2007 at the age of 16, partly to get out of his home town, Barrow-in-Furness, in Cumbria. He'd faced homophobic bullying at school and thought a \"macho\" role in the infantry would help mask the fact that he was gay.\n\n\"I was living with these guys seven days a week, and I started copying how straight men moved.

It was a dangerous job in territory largely controlled by the Taliban.\n\n\"Once you've been shot at it never leaves your brain. The bullet that comes near you sounds like a crack of a whip. There were countless operations where I was in a near-death situation, almost blown up in armoured vehicles by improvised devices or ducking shells from our Apache [helicopter].\"\n\nRiding wasn't hurt himself, but many were.\n\n\"There was a task to go out and do some metal-detecting. We played a game of rock paper scissors to decide who should go on patrol and who should stay behind. I won the game. He went out and was shot in the ankle.\"\n\nImage copyright Phil Riding\n\nOne of his roles in Afghanistan was to drive lorries. Once he went on rest and recreation, and the driver who took his place rolled over an IED and ended up having his back reconstructed.\n\nHe was lucky, but being lucky made him feel guilty. \"Shouldn't it have been me? Shouldn't I have gone on patrol?\" he asks.\n\nComing close to death made Riding think hard about his life, and he decided to come out and live authentically as a gay man. \"It was like being born again,\" he says. \"This time I was being who I wanted to be - myself.\"\n\nInitially his family didn't take the news well. Around Christmas 2011, when Same-Sex Marriage Bill was passing through Parliament, Riding's younger brother asked if he would get married. His grandmother then said she wouldn't attend the wedding if so, and his mother followed suit. \"There was an argument, and I wish that I had handled it better,\" he says. He left home on Boxing Day.\n\nComing out to people in the army didn't go well either. Some former friends got up and left when he sat down next to them at dinner. Things only improved after he launched a complaint. Now he decorated his bedside exuberantly with rainbow flags and male pin-ups.\n\nImage copyright Phillip Riding Image caption Marching at Pride in 2015\n\nHe also found solace in London's LGBT community, travelling up there at the weekends.

Just you and all those soldiers, and nothing happened? Yeah right!'\"\n\nBeing in the army isn't like it's depicted in the movies. \"Not everyone is really handsome, dashing. You're enjoying not thinking about romance. From the moment you wake up, you're working and your mind is on the job.\"\n\nBut the high-octane pace of clubbing also seemed to serve one of his needs after the tour in Afghanistan.\n\n\"When you have adrenaline pumped into you every single day for seven months, when you come home that's missing. Time moves slow. People moved slowly. It was so quiet. I needed to be in the clubs to fill that gap.\n\n\"Being in a nightclub, it's just so loud, the bass in the floor. There is so much energy everywhere - it's sensory overload.\"\n\nImage copyright Joel Ryder\n\nRiding had his driving licence revoked after being caught speeding twice in two years after he returned from Helmand. \"Once I was going 85 mph on a 60 mph dual carriageway with music at full blast. Risky stuff like that because it was an adrenaline rush.\"\n\nHe thinks that the excitement of coming out probably helped to mask his PTSD after Afghanistan. \"I didn't think I had an issue. I was dealing with accepting my sexuality and meeting all these new people. For the first time in my life, there were people who I fancied who actually fancied me back!\"\n\nWhen it came to renew his contract with the army in October 2015, he decided against it and took up a job as an events manager for a nightclub. He would go into Soho in the day, arrange the events and be ready to work late into the night, while socialising with friends.\n\nBut he found himself asking this question: \"I've come out, but why am I still hitting the bottle? Why am I still not wanting to go to sleep?\"\n\nAnd a month later, on Remembrance Day, he received an answer.\n\nRiding likens the feeling of suppressing his PTSD to trying to hold down an inflatable ball in water. \"It's different for everybody, but this is what it's like for me. I kept trying to hold down all the things I saw and you can only hold it down for so long. The more you hold it down, the stronger the ball shoots back up, more powerful than before. And that's what happened with me.\"\n\nHe started having nightmares about his time on tour and working all night seemed to help him cope.\n\n\"I would have flashbacks. I did what I could to avoid closing my eyes in case I started to see Afghanistan,\" he says. \"I wanted to physically exhaust myself, so that when I eventually got home in the early hours, I could just collapse in bed and I wouldn't dream.\"\n\nThe Last Post had been the first sound to trigger Riding's PTSD, but other everyday sounds now had the same effect - a motorcycle abruptly appearing from nowhere or someone yelling in the street.\n\nWhat does PTSD feel like?\n\nFlashbacks & nightmares: These can be so realistic that it feels as though you are living through the traumatic experience again and again - ordinary sounds, sights and smells can trigger flashbacks\n\nAvoidance & numbing: You distract yourself by keeping your mind busy with an activity or working very hard, while avoiding places and people that remind you of the trauma - and you may try to become emotionally numb, feeling nothing at all\n\nBeing hypervigilant: You stay alert all the time, as though you are looking out for danger - anxiety makes it hard to sleep, and others may notice that you are irritable and cannot relax\n\nSource: The Royal College of Psychiatrists\n\nThere was a trigger in the club as well.\n\n\"At midnight they have this balloon drop, balloons fall from the ceiling and they bounce on the crowd. The sound it makes is just like gunfire happening over my head.\"\n\nThe first time he experienced it he was frozen on the spot. \"It shocked me that even though my brain was telling me I am literally just seeing balloons fall down, I couldn't move because I was panicking.\"\n\nIt got to the point that Riding would leave quickly when the balloon drop was about to happen and his friends noticed. \"No-one understood why, because I didn't tell anyone. They just thought I was weirdo, that 'Phil doesn't like balloons.'\"\n\nImage copyright Phillip Riding Image caption Phillip Riding and Chrissy Darling at Popcorn, Heaven\n\nHe felt that working in the club brought some order to his life. \"I was in the military for years, having that authority, I got used to it. In a way, being that person that people look to in the nightclub for direction is similar.\"\n\nBut the sense of the club as a safe space was shattered on 12 June 2016, when a gunman opened fire at a gay nightclub - Pulse, in Orlando, Florida - killing 49 people and injuring 53 before being shot dead by police. At the time, it was the deadliest massacre in modern American history.\n\nStatistics on military PTSD\n\n17% of ex-forces whose last deployment was a combat role in Iraq or Afghanistan would probably qualify for a PTSD diagnosis, according to a study published last month by the King's Centre for Military Health Research\n\nPTSD prevalence rates for the military population as a whole have increased from about 4% in 2003-4 to about 6% in 2014-15 - the rate could be as high as 9% in some combat units, researchers from the King's Centre told the Commons Defence Select Committee in March\n\nThey added that 50% of the PTSD that arises in the forces is caused by non-operational traumatic incidents such as car accidents or assaults\n\nRiding had actually been to Pulse in 2011. \"I know the venue and I knew some of the people who were there that night. I think about them pinned down in the bathroom... and having to witness their friends and family being shot and killed,\" he says.\n\n\"It was horrifying, warfare coming into the community I know and love. Before I felt that I could keep the worlds apart but now they are crashing into each other. The idea that a terrorist attack could happen here too.\"\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time, Riding says, mentioning the 1999 nail-bomb attack carried out by a neo-Nazi at the Admiral Duncan, one of Soho's oldest gay pubs.\n\nHe started to be troubled by intrusive thoughts, imagining bad things happening to his family and friends. In Afghanistan he had been bothered by the thought that if he had acted differently, a comrade might not have got hurt. Now this kind of thinking became obsessive and infiltrated his daily life.\n\nWhen meeting a friend for coffee in Soho, he would imagine a bomb exploding in the gay bar next door and his friend dying in front of him. \"The questions cross my mind, 'What if they were just late by 10 minutes? What if I had just gone shopping, and they wouldn't have had to come meet me?'\n\n\"It never ends. This guilt is unbearable. Not just the guilt of what has happened but even hypothetical situations. So what can I do?\"\n\nIt took years for Riding to be formally diagnosed with PTSD and start receiving therapy.\n\nFor a long time he tried to avoid seeking help, mistakenly believing that a diagnosis of PTSD on his medical record would harm his prospects when applying for jobs. Other soldiers were under the same illusion, he says.\n\n\"It's one of those urban legends. We simply didn't talk about mental health to each other so I didn't know. I wish I had known sooner.\"\n\nHelp for those affected\n\nNowadays he makes a conscious effort to rethink the noises that trigger his PTSD. At 27, he's made a conscious effort to associate the national anthem with good times. \"It always has me in tears,\" he says. \"I want to think instead about all the good times with all the brave lads.\"\n\nHe says that his sleeping is better now and that he's in control of his PTSD - not the other way round. Trying to bury it, he says, was the wrong idea.\n\n\"So if my PTSD is that inflatable ball - it's like it's been deflated. It'll still be here but I'm holding it down for now.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nIt's well known that soldiers can suffer from post-traumatic stress after their experiences on the battlefield - but the effect this has on their families is rarely discussed.

At least 81 people have lost their lives and hundreds more have been reported missing. As families across the US come together for Thanksgiving, Paradise's residents are beginning to assess the damage to their lives and the town they called home.\n\nWhen gale-force winds drove flames from the Camp Fire through dried-out scrub and trees into Paradise on 8 November, its people fled for their lives.\n\nIn the space of a day, the flames had engulfed much of the town - home to 27,000.\n\nSorry, your browser cannot display this map\n\nSome of the victims died trying to get away, while others were discovered in the burned-out ruins of their homes.\n\nAn estimated 13,000 homes were destroyed, with many of the town's mainly-wooden houses quickly reduced to ashes.\n\nThe authorities are still working to search and identify bodies as the fire continues to burn in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada.\n\nWhile a forecast of heavy rains could help extinguish the flames, it could also hinder the search for the remains of victims and cause misery for those left homeless by the disaster.\n\nInteractive Paradise's Kilcrease Circle is among the burnt-out areas (slide to compare before and after) 17 November 2018 10 September 2018\n\nThe Camp Fire scorched 152,000 acres of land along with the thousands of the homes built on it. The blaze is still only 75% contained.\n\nThe fire isn't expected to be fully under control until the end of the month, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nThanksgiving plans\n\nAs the rest of America sits down to celebrate Thanksgiving on Thursday, those left homeless by the raging Camp Fire are contemplating their futures.\n\nA number of organisations are on hand to help with the immediate crisis, providing shelter, clothes and food.\n\nAnd for Thanksgiving itself, meals are being donated by several non-profit organisations - the day seen as a chance to bring together those affected to start the healing process.\n\nFor Kassy Parish, 19, such generosity after the trauma of the fire has been comforting.\n\nImage copyright Kassy Parish Image caption Kassy Rose Parish, her twin sister Alli and their family home before the fire\n\nShe plans to spend Thanksgiving at her mother-in-law's, but a stranger has offered her twin sister, Alli, somewhere to sleep and invited her to join his family for the annual celebratory meal.\n\n\"It's brought out so much good in a lot of people in the area,\" said Kassy. \"A lot of people have been getting together and making sure everyone is taken care of.\"\n\nKassy was staying with her mom and stepfather at their home on Skyway - one of the three main routes into Paradise - when the fire spread through the town. Their house was burned down. Her six siblings also lost their homes.\n\nBefore the disaster struck, the town was a popular retirement spot and, according to the latest census, about a quarter of the population was aged 65 or over.\n\nKassy worked as a personal carer providing support for adults in the town when they were unable to live independently.\n\nShe plans to stay in the town, where everyone knows everyone.\n\n\"I know it's going to take a couple of years until Paradise is rebuilt but I have lived here all my life,\" she said.\n\nThousands affected\n\nAlthough, there is no exact figure for the number of people left homeless, six official evacuation centres have been set up, including two in fairgrounds which had closed for the season. Some people have also taken refuge in tents or cars.\n\nHundreds of Red Cross volunteers are helping run the emergency shelters, which slept up to 950 on one night, as well as providing meals for all evacuees. They are also dealing with a fast-spreading norovirus outbreak, which has been reported at four of them.\n\nThe Red Cross is helping people search for those still missing, through their safe and well website.\n\nSean Smith, debris coordinator for the California Office of Emergency Services told Time magazine the post-fire clean-up would be the biggest since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.\n\nOne estimate puts the cost at $1.2 billion (about \u00a3900m).\n\nAlong with the 13,000 homes destroyed, almost 500 businesses have also been hit.\n\nMorgan Stanley estimates insured property losses could approach $4 billion (\u00a33.1m), while Moody's Investor Services puts the figure at $6.8bn (\u00a35.3m).\n\n\"It's one of the worst disasters that I've seen in my career, hands down,\" Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Brock Long told a news conference.\n\nWhile federal funds are expected to provide about 75% of Paradise's recovery costs, the state of California will also contribute.\n\nImage copyright Justin Sullivan\n\nThe money will help rebuild streets, public utilities and buildings and possibly install a new sewer system - Paradise was the largest town in California relying on septic tanks - but families without insurance may have to bear the cost of rebuilding their own homes.\n\nKassy and her family have set up a crowdfunding page to help them get back on their feet. Others are expected to do the same.\n\n'Survived three fires'\n\nBut for Maurine Johnson, who has lived in Paradise for more than 60 years, it is too soon to contemplate the future.\n\nThe 79-year-old great-great grandmother has lost her family home and her estate agency business, built up over many years with her late husband. Her two sons have also lost their homes.\n\nShe has experienced blazes before, but this one was different, she said.\n\n\"We have been through two or three fires up there and never felt threatened or worried.\"\n\nMaurine, who fell over and broke her nose and damaged her teeth while visiting her sister-in-law at one of the evacuation centres, described how she fled her home with just one change of clothes and her mobile phone.\n\nShe admitted she still did not appreciate the gravity of her situation, but has been cheered by other people's generosity.\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\n\"I am having to wear donated clothes,\" she said. \"It's a humbling experience when you are having to take from people.\"\n\nIt is this spirit of giving that has led many organisations to provide 15,000 Thanksgiving meals to Camp Fire survivors at several locations, including shelters, on Thursday.\n\nFood for the Thanksgiving Together events will be provided by the non-profit World Central Kitchen and Sierra Nevada Brewing Co, while celebrity chefs will work side by side with Paradise restaurant owners to prepare the food.\n\n\"We have seen the power of food to bring communities together, especially in times of great need,\" reads a post on the World Central Kitchen website.\n\nBut the question for many of those affected by the Paradise fire, is whether they will return to the town.\n\nMayor of Paradise Jody Jones believes they will and that the town will be reborn.\n\n\"We're committed to rebuilding,\" she said. \"It's not an 'if', it's 'How long is it going to take?'\"\n\nBut Maurine, who is considering winding up her estate agency business and retiring, fears many will not return.

Why are solar storms such a threat?\n\nIn 1972, dozens of sea mines off the coast of Vietnam mysteriously exploded.\n\nIt was recently confirmed the cause was solar storms, which can significantly disrupt the Earth's magnetic field.\n\nToday, the effects of a similar event could be much more serious - disrupting the technology we rely on for everything from satellites to power grids. The cost to the UK economy alone of an unexpected event has been estimated at \u00a316bn.\n\nThere are good reasons why we are vulnerable to events taking place millions of miles from Earth.\n\nWhat causes an extreme solar event?\n\nThe Sun is a star, a seething mass of electrified hydrogen. As this fluid moves around, it builds up energy within its complex magnetic field.\n\nThis magnetic energy is released through intense flashes of light known as solar flares and through vast eruptions of material and magnetic fields known as coronal mass ejections or solar storms.\n\nWhile flares can disrupt radio communication on Earth, solar storms pose the greatest threat.\n\nEach storm contains the energy equivalent to 100,000 times the world's entire nuclear arsenal, although this is spread throughout an enormous volume in space.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The northern lights over Finland\n\nThe Sun rotates like a vast spinning firework, launching eruptions into space in all directions.\n\nIf one of these heads towards our planet, with a magnetic field aligned opposite to the Earth's, the two fields can merge together. As the solar storm washes past, some of the Earth's magnetic field is distorted into a long tail.\n\nAnd when this distorted magnetic field eventually snaps back, it accelerates electrified particles towards the Earth. Here, they strike the upper atmosphere, heating it and causing it to glow in a spectacular display known as the northern and southern lights.\n\nBut this distortion of the Earth's magnetic field has other, more significant effects.\n\nIt is thought to have triggered the sea mines back in 1972. The mines were designed to detect small variations in the magnetic field caused by the approach of metal-hulled boats. But their engineers hadn't anticipated that solar activity could have the same effect.\n\nWhen will the next extreme weather event happen?\n\nScientists are looking for clues as to what triggers these vast eruptions and, once they have been launched, how to track them through interplanetary space.\n\nOur records of the Earth's magnetic field go back as far as the mid-19th Century. They suggest an extreme space weather event is likely to occur once every 100 years, although smaller events will happen more frequently. In 1859, the Carrington Event - most extreme solar storm recorded to date - caused telegraph systems to spark and for the northern lights to be spotted as far south as the Bahamas.\n\nThe next time it happens, the effects are likely to be far more serious.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Observers at the launch of a satellite\n\nWith every solar cycle, our global community has become more reliant on technology.\n\nIn 2018, space satellites are central to global communication and navigation, while aeroplanes connect continents and extensive power grids crisscross the world.\n\nAll of these could be badly affected by the aftermath of extreme solar events.\n\nElectronic systems on spacecraft and aeroplanes could be harmed as their miniaturised electronics are zapped by energetic particles accelerated into our atmosphere, while power networks on the ground can be overwhelmed by excess electrical currents.\n\nMore like this\n\nPlanning ahead\n\nEnough satellites and power grids have failed during past space weather events to make it clear that the Sun must be closely monitored, to help predict when a solar storm will affect Earth.\n\nForecasters are working on this all over the world, from the UK's Met Office to the Australian Met Bureau and the Noaa Space Weather Prediction Center in the US.\n\nAll being well, they can detect when a storm is heading towards Earth and predict its arrival time within six hours. That still leaves relatively little time to prepare but forecasting would cut the cost to the UK economy from \u00a316bn to \u00a33bn.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Mauna Kea Observatory summit, in Hawaii\n\nSpace weather now appears on the UK government's risk register, alongside other, more familiar risks such as a flu pandemic and severe flooding. It has been rated at the equivalent risk as a severe heatwave or the emergence of a new infectious disease.\n\nGovernment agencies are now speaking to power companies, spacecraft and airline operators to ensure they have plans in place to limit the impact of an extreme space weather event.\n\nIt is vital, for example, to make sure enough power is available to refrigerate supplies of food and medicine as well as to make sure water and fuel can be pumped as needed.\n\nIf communication with some satellites is lost, familiar technologies such as sat-navs and satellite television could stop working.\n\nSpacecraft engineers study extreme events so they can build resilience into spacecraft, protecting vulnerable electronics and installing backup systems.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nAn accurate space weather forecast would enable operators to further protect their assets by ensuring they were in a safe state as the storm passed.\n\nMany planes fly over the north pole en route from Europe to North America. During space weather events, aircraft operators re-route aeroplanes away from the polar skies, where most of the energetic particles enter Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThis is to limit exposure to enhanced radiation doses and ensure reliable radio communication.\n\nWe have learned much about space weather since the events of 1972 but as modern technologies evolve, we need to make sure they can withstand the worst the Sun can throw at us.\n\nAbout this piece\n\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.\n\nChris Scott is a professor of space and atmospheric physics, at the University of Reading.

There is a tax incentive to knock buildings down, which is frankly insane.\"\n\nA survey of over 2,000 UK adults published today by BITC and Ipsos MORI shows consumers want to do their bit to reduce waste.\n\nThe most popular actions from business to help consumers were:\n\nMoney-back incentives to encourage return of used packaging\n\nDedicated spaces in shops to return used packaging and clothing\n\nLoyalty points\n\nHiring things rather than buying them\n\nWaste Facts\n\nIn 2014 the UK generated 202.8 million tonnes of total waste. 59.4% came from construction, demolition and excavation, with households responsible for a further 13.7%. \u2013 DEFRA.\n\nAmanda Mackenzie, chief executive of Business in the Community, said: \u201cThe old adage \u2018waste not want not\u2019 has never been more relevant.\n\n\u201cThe research shows that customers welcome action from business which encourages them to do the right thing. Let\u2019s tackle this critical problem together and lead the world in doing so.\u201d\n\nSome other nations are, in fact, well ahead of the UK in re-using items. Finland is one of many countries with sophisticated superstores for up-cycled and second-hand goods.\n\nIn the UK, Devon County Council has taken a lead on the issue, and the website Freegle offers people the opportunity to give unwanted items away.\n\nSignatories to the BITC initiative so far include Co-Operative Bank, Deloitte, Greggs, Heineken, Iceland, Lloyds Banking Group, Marks & Spencer, PwC, Sky, Thames Water, Toyota, Costain, Arup, Marshalls, Unilever and Veolia.\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "Reality Check: How effective is the flu jab?", "description": "Millions of people are vaccinated against flu each year.

We still do not fully understand this - all we know is that we see more girls in our clinics.\n\n\"We have to make sure services are available for them.\"\n\nIt comes as the Children's Commissioner for England warned there was a \"vast gap\" in NHS mental health support.\n\nAnne Longfield's report criticised slow progress made in improving specialist community services for children.\n\nShe said waiting times were too long and she was concerned about numbers being rejected by services in some areas.\n\nNearly half of those in their late teens with mental health problems had self-harmed or attempted suicide. For younger teens it was about a quarter.\n\n'I've missed so much of my life'\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Poor mental health \"has taken so much of my life from me\"\n\nEmma Blezard, 18, says her mental health problems have robbed her of her teenage years.\n\nShe started experiencing difficulties when she was 13, suffering from anxiety and panic attacks before developing an eating disorder.\n\nIt was a year before she let on to her parents. She ended up having suicidal thoughts and was sectioned in hospital at one point.\n\n\"I've missed so much of my life because of this illness - I've lost friends, I've missed birthday, holidays.\n\n\"I wish I could do things over.\"\n\nEven when she was receiving treatment, she felt she did not deserve it.\n\n\"I became really isolated. At school I spent a lot of time out of lessons with the nurse. It was very difficult.\"\n\nShe has travelled all over the country for treatment and says she still struggles, although her problems are more manageable now.\n\n\"I don't think they will ever go away.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How should we talk about mental health?\n\nIs social media to blame for problems young people face?\n\nIt may be a factor, although it is hard to tell.\n\nThe NHS Digital review found children aged 11 to 19 with a mental health problem were more likely to use social media.\n\nNearly a third of them spent over four hours a day on social media.\n\nThose who did not have a mental health problem were two to three times less likely to spend that amount of time on it.\n\nThe young people with mental health problems were more likely to say their mood was affected by the number of \"likes\" they got and they were also more likely to compare themselves to others on social media.\n\nThe report cited cyber-bullying as an issue too.\n\nBut while this does suggest social media can have a negative impact, it does not prove it is to blame.\n\nPeople with mental health problems may be just more likely to find themselves on it, rather than it causing their problems in the first place. Indeed, they could even be using social media for support.\n\nAdolescence is key\n\nThe majority of problems reported, particularly in the older age groups, are linked to emotional disorders.\n\nThese are on the rise, whereas the other disorders they looked at - behavioural and hyperactivity - have remained relatively stable over time.\n\nUniversity College London psychiatrist Dr Michael Bloomfield said: \"Adolescence is a critical period for a person's development, particularly as our brains go through important changes during our teenage years.\n\n\"Since prevention is better than cure, it is really important for all of us in society to understand together why this is and start reducing the rates of mental disorders in young people.\"\n\nHow many children get help?\n\nThe NHS is only treating a fraction of the young people who have problems.\n\nThe Children's Commissioner's analysis of NHS figures from 2017-18 show that 325,000 children were treated by community services, while there are another 5,000 in hospital.\n\nThat is fewer than 3% of the population.\n\nThe figures showed that more than a third of young people referred to community services were turned away.\n\nThis could be because their needs were not severe enough to need help and could be dealt with through other services, such as in school or by charities and council social care teams.\n\nBut Ms Longfield said she was concerned children were getting turned away because services simply did not have time to see them.\n\nHer report also raised concerns about waiting times.

In more than a few cases, the opposition MSPs on the committee forced through changes against the wishes of the SNP minority.\n\nSo what are the key alterations that have been made?\n\nMusic venues\n\nImage caption Who should pay to soundproof music venues when new developments spring up nearby?\n\nAmendments were passed to include the \"agent of change\" principle in the bill, which requires developers moving into areas containing music venues to pay for any soundproofing needed.\n\nAt present, the cost of mitigating noise impacts on neighbouring residents and businesses falls on the premises making the noise - even if it has been in the area long before the new housing or business developments appeared.\n\nBoth Labour and the Conservatives have taken credit for the move, having both passed amendments\n\nTory member Adam Tomkins said: \"It's only fair that developers looking to build in an area take responsibility for any impact on existing businesses, and I'm very pleased that colleagues across the party divide share this view.\"\n\nLabour's Lewis Macdonald added: \"The outcome of today's vote will change the future for many venues currently facing the threat of closure, and is an important step in protecting these venues and the night time economy they help support.\"\n\nShort-term lets\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption MSPs have raised concerns about the proliferation of short-term lets, particularly in cities like Edinburgh\n\nGreen MSP Andy Wightman managed to pass an amendment requiring people to get planning permission if they want to convert their home into a short-term let.\n\nThe proposal would not stand in the way of people letting out a spare room, but would apply when they seek to turn an entire property into a holiday let.\n\nMr Wightman argued that \"the uncontrolled and rapid rise in short-term lets in our cities and our rural communities is depriving families and individuals of badly-needed long-term homes\".\n\nMr Stewart said he was \"very sympathetic to the intention behind the amendments\", highlighting \"concerns about the effects on long-term communities of houses and flats being used for short-term letting\". However, he said there were \"significant difficulties with the wording\".\n\nThe amendment was passed despite the committee's three SNP members voting against it, while Mr Wightman agreed to bring back a further amendment on the same topic for discussion at stage three.\n\nLand value capture\n\nImage copyright Google Image caption Andy Wightman raised Edinburgh's waterfront as an area with \"swathes of vacant land\" allocated for housing\n\nConservative MSP Graham Simpson amended the bill to include a \"land value capture\" system for use inside the new local planning zones.\n\nThis is a scheme based on the fact that the value of a piece of land tends to shoot up once planning permission has been granted for development on it.\n\nThe amendment passed would give councils the power to include provision for compulsory purchase of land inside new \"masterplan consent areas\", where development is encouraged.\n\nThis would mean that councils could buy land for what it is worth based on its current use, rather than a value inflated by what it might be used for in future. That way public bodies can benefit from any increase in value, potentially to pay for infrastructure or other extras.\n\nMr Wightman said: \"A classic example is the waterfront in Edinburgh where there are swathes of vacant land that have been allocated for housing for years. Developers have been biding their time while the land value rises and the city's housing crisis worsens.\n\n\"This land should be available for the council to buy at its current value so it can get on with the job of building affordable housing for ownership and rent.\"\n\nAmendments on this passed despite SNP members opposing them, with Mr Stewart arguing that while the government is \"interested in the concept of land value capture\", it could wait until next spring when the Scottish Land Commission is due to report back on the matter.\n\nLocal development plans\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The bill aims to make local development planning simpler and more embedded in communities\n\nLocal development plans (LDPs) are set out by planning authorities - usually councils - every five years, and identify sites for new projects and set out policies that help guide decision-making at a local level.\n\nThe planning bill aims to streamline these - so that they need to be produced every 10 years, rather than five, and making them a bit easier to produce - while designing them to reflect community priorities better.\n\nOpposition parties proposed a number of changes to how this system would work, to include more involvement and protections for communities.\n\nThe Greens amended in a requirement for planning authorities to consider the provision of public toilets and water refill stations as part of LDPs.\n\nLabour also managed to add a section requiring planners to consider if there are sufficient \"play opportunities\" for young people in local areas.\n\nThird-party right of appeal\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Who should be allowed to appeal against planning decisions?\n\nThis is a big one which failed to make its way into the bill at stage two - but that we probably haven't heard the last of.\n\nThe planning system as it stands is primarily conducted between the applicants (the first party) and the local authority (the second). Some campaigners want local people or communities to be allowed to appeal against planning decisions as a third party.\n\nLabour's Monica Lennon insisted that her amendments to this end were not a boost for \"not in my back yard\" types, but were about improving community involvement in the planning process.\n\nHowever, the government does not support third-party right of appeal, with Mr Stewart telling the committee that additional appeals could \"add time, complexity and conflict to the process\", centralise decisions and deter investment.\n\nThe SNP were able to knock down Labour's amendments when the Conservatives abstained on the votes, with Mr Simpson saying his party was split on the matter and would come to a decision by stage three.\n\nHe said that while the system must be changed, he recognised concerns that allowing third-party right of appeal would \"slow up an almost snail's-pace system\"."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Why an Indian village is losing sleep over the humble nightie", "description": "A favourite with millions of Indian women, this loose garment has fallen foul of a village council.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-46235692", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16532/production/_104424419_003.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T00:18:13Z", "content": "Image copyright Priya Kuriyan A committee of village elders in southern India has banned women from wearing nighties during the day.

But over the years, they have become a favourite daytime dress for millions of women, especially housewives, across Indian cities, towns and even villages.\n\nFour months ago, a nine-member council in the village of Tokalapalli in Andhra Pradesh state, surprisingly headed by a woman, ordered that girls and women must not wear nighties from 7am to 7pm and those who did would have to pay a fine of 2,000 rupees ($28; \u00a322).\n\nThose who snitched on anyone breaching the ban were promised a cash reward of 1,000 rupees.\n\nThe order is being strictly followed by the villagers and, so far, there have been no reports of anyone being penalised.\n\nVillage elder Balle Vishnu Murthy told a visiting colleague from BBC Telugu that the ban was to stop women from exposing their bodies. \"It is okay to wear nighties at home but wearing them outdoors could attract attention and cause trouble for the wearer,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright Priya Kuriyan\n\nSome residents - both women and men - said they opposed the order but had fallen in line because otherwise they would have to cough up the fine, which is a significant amount of money in this village of fisherfolk.\n\nThis is not the first time the humble nightie has invited the wrath of the \"moral police\". In 2014, a women's group in a village near Mumbai called daytime nightie wearing an \"indecent practice\" and threatened to impose a fine of 500 rupees on violators. That ban fizzled out because the women refused to abide by it.\n\nBut why are there such strong feelings about what is essentially just a piece of clothing? And a piece of clothing that is generally looked at with much disdain by anyone who appreciates fashion?\n\nWriting in the Mint newspaper in 2014, Shefalee Vasudev, editor of the recently-launched digital fashion portal The Voice of Fashion, said the nightie was \"as shapely as a potato sack and as insipid as a stale marshmallow\" and wanted it to be \"dubbed as India's Top Fuddy Duddy Garment\".\n\nImage copyright Priya Kuriyan\n\nBut talking to the BBC recently, Ms Vasudev said she believed that the village council ban had been dictated by the \"moral police\" rather than the \"fashion police\".\n\nNighties are a multi-million dollar business and markets across the country are full of ready-to-wear designs. The most popular ones are made from floral printed cotton and can be bought for as little as 100 rupees, although the premium range can cost a few thousands.\n\nDesigner Rimzim Dadu says nighties are so popular with housewives because traditional attire like the sari is not the best or most comfortable garment for doing household chores in. The nightie, she says, has set them free.\n\nDesigner David Abraham adds: \"It's not the most elegant garment but it has become a uniform of sorts for women because it's convenient and practical. It meets all their requirements - it's a single piece of clothing so you just pull it on, it's ankle length and covers the entire body so it's modest too.\"\n\nBoth Ms Dadu and Mr Abraham are appalled by the ban - Ms Dadu calls it \"outrageous\" while Mr Abraham describes it as \"ridiculous\".\n\nNighties are believed to have first arrived in India during British colonial rule as night gowns worn by English women. In time, they were adopted as night wear by elite Indian women.\n\nIt's not clear when the nightie moved from the bedroom to the streets, but Shefalee Vasudev says while growing up in the 1970s in small-town Gujarat, she saw \"mummies and aunties\" wearing them through the day and sometimes even going out dressed in them to the local market to shop.\n\nImage copyright Priya Kuriyan\n\nIn the 90s, when she moved to Delhi, she says she was astonished to see young mothers wearing it while doing the school bus run with their children or haggling with roadside vegetable vendors.\n\nIt's a real eyesore, she says, when women wear it with \"mis-matched petticoats if the garment is thin and throw a cotton dupatta [scarf] over it to appear modest\".\n\nMs Vasudev says she understands the nightie's appeal in the middle-class housewife's life - as \"the garment of liberation\" which frees them from the confining sari.\n\nBut what she can't understand is the \"patriarchal moral police\" describing the nightie as \"obscene\" and trying to ban it.\n\n\"It can't be called sexy or obscene,\" she insists. \"In fact, it's one of the most desexualised pieces of crap that a woman can wear.\"\n\nShe says the reason why some want to banish the nightie is because they believe it's \"more Western, more modern\" and hence, it's obscene.\n\nDavid Abraham agrees. \"Obscenity lies in the eye of the viewer,\" he says, describing the ban as \"totally illogical\".\n\nThe village council order, he says, is gender driven and all about patriarchy and power.\n\n\"Have you ever heard about a village council meeting to decide what men wear? It's always about women's clothing. The belief the moral police have is today it's a nightie, tomorrow - who knows?\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "Simon Jack and DJ Sideman talk housing", "description": "Radio 1 Xtra DJ Sideman and the BBC's Simon Jack talk housing - and buying a first home.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/business-46292360/simon-jack-and-dj-sideman-talk-housing-i-need-a-crib", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5FD5/production/_104433542_p06sg9vm.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T00:17:26Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "'We need more followers on Economic Insta'\n\nRadio 1 Xtra DJ Sideman wonders why shoes have become more expensive since Brexit.

It might seem faster but you've been already waiting.\n\nSo, treating all suspected cancers at the same - and all getting a 62-day treatment target from the point it is suspected - will aim to see more of these \"non-urgent\" patients faster too, and enable more to survive.\n\nNot only that, but because the non-urgent pathway does not measure how long people have been bouncing around the NHS system before a decision is taken to start treatment, the experts argue it's impossible to find out where the real delays are.\n\nMr Gething said health boards would \"shadow report\" the new target alongside the existing ones.\n\nHe said: \"Through dual reporting of the single cancer pathway, Wales will be the first UK nation to move towards a single waiting time measure for cancer.\n\n\"It is reflective of our aspiration to support early diagnosis of cancer and ensure fast and effective treatment for all patients.\"\n\nWhat the experts say\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Prof Tom Crosby said it was important to diagnose as soon as possible\n\nDoctors say there are \"considerable challenges\" with rising demand, while they aim for earlier diagnosis to push Wales up the league tables for cancer survival in Europe.\n\nProf Tom Crosby, medical director of the Wales Cancer Network, said he believed the single cancer pathway was ambitious but the aim was to improve patient chances as well as their experience and also be a \"platform\" for improving access to diagnostic screenings and tests, which would be coming under increasing pressure.\n\n\"This has the potential to transform our diagnostic cancer services in Wales and I believe Wales would be leading the way in this regard,\" he said.\n\n\"Scotland are very interested in what we're doing, England are looking at something a little more modest, focusing just on the diagnostic part of the journey.

The lump was the size of a small pea and she was told that it was likely to be cyst and was given antibiotics. Dawn returned again to her GP when she felt it was growing and painful and she was referred to hospital.\n\n\"In my head an urgent, emergency referral would be instantaneous - but I waited about another three weeks and in the meantime found another lump under my armpit and the original lump even bigger.\"\n\nDawn, who has two daughters and a stepdaughter, was finally seen by a specialist and had all the tests and cancer was diagnosed.

But the sound and fury that then came from all political parties in the House of Commons soon ended that.\n\nAnd, while government ministers in 27 EU capitals are studying that proposed withdrawal agreement, desks in the Swiss capital Berne are bare.\n\nIt is an awkward position for British-Swiss trade ties to be in. The two countries are among each other's largest trading partners, and have enjoyed stable economic ties for years.\n\nIn 2017 the UK was Switzerland's fifth biggest overseas market, with exports totalling 11.4bn Swiss francs, according to official Swiss figures.\n\nGoing in the other direction, UK exports to Switzerland in 2016 were valued at \u00a321bn, its sixth largest.\n\n\"The fact is, any kind of uncertainty is poison for business, for investment, for any sort of decisions,\" says Mr Simonian.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt recently visited Switzerland\n\nThe Swiss government has come up with a strategy to minimise uncertainty, quaintly called \"Mind the Gap\". The idea is to try to prevent a regulatory vacuum with the UK should the end of March arrive and a withdrawal deal with the EU has still not been agreed.\n\nPointing out the close ties Switzerland and the UK have - including 150 direct flights a day - Swiss government ministers have been beating a path to London for the last two years.\n\nNot for official negotiations of course, but for informal talks. And rumour has it that things have been going well.\n\nGlobal Trade\n\nMore from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:\n\nWhen the UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt paid a visit to Berne last month he told journalists it had been \"an excellent visit\", though he declined to answer any questions about what exactly was discussed.\n\nJan Atteslander confesses that he and his colleagues in Swiss business are eying some opportunities in a post-EU UK.\n\n\"The UK has a high-tech industry in industrial goods, in machining, and the car industry has developed very strongly,\" he says.\n\n\"Also in pharmaceuticals, the chemical industry is really top notch, it's a natural partner, because we are also innovation based.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Swiss government is keeping a close eye on Theresa May's Brexit negotiations\n\nMr Simonian too sees openings for greater trade, though not, interestingly, in financial services, a sector in which both countries are already very strong.\n\n\"In the end they are very deep competitors [in the world of finance], so I would be cautious on that front,\" he says.\n\nGiven that all the ties between the UK and Switzerland will have to be rewritten, the Swiss could in theory opt for some kind of customs arrangement with the UK (if it is not in the EU customs union).\n\nIt could even perhaps maintain freedom of movement with the UK (the Swiss signed up to EU free movement years ago in order to gain access to the single market), if the UK thinks it might be worth hanging on to free movement with Switzerland alone.\n\nBut none of these options can be properly agreed, let alone put in place, until the UK and the EU finalise their deal. So are the Swiss confident about the future?\n\n\"Confident might be the wrong word,\" says Mr Zimmermann. \"We know that the Swiss government is doing everything to ensure a smooth change\u2026 but there are still lots of uncertainties.\"\n\nThe end of March is four months away - not a long time to rewrite trade relations, as the seemingly endless negotiations between the EU and the UK have proven.\n\nThe Swiss don't like last-minute decisions, and they don't like delays.

Now he's living in a flat of his own.\n\nLouis contracted meningitis when he was a few days old and his brain was damaged.\n\nAs a result he has learning disabilities and his communication is impaired.\n\nHe went to a residential school and went home at weekends but at the end of school he struggled and ended up in a hospital inpatient unit.\n\nMore recently he had to take a place in a care home four hours drive from his mother's home in Perthshire.\n\nKate Sainsbury said it was wonderful to have him back close to her.\n\n\"It is the end of a long journey,\" she said.\n\nImage caption Kate Sainsbury said it was a new opportunity for her son\n\n\"We have been through really dark places full of despair because he was 240 miles away and now he is 24 miles away.\n\n\"And it is the start of a new opportunity for Louis to live in this lovely flat.\"\n\nKate added: \"If Louis had a physical condition - if he had cancer - and you said to me 'does it seem right that Louis has the right treatment?' we would be saying, 'of course, it is right that he has the right treatment for cancer or a physical ailment'\n\n\"Whereas with social care is so often not recognised that it is important to have expert, consistent care in the life of a young man like Louis.\"\n\nNew 15-bed care home\n\nMany experts take the view that everyone, regardless of the complexity of their needs, should be able to live in their own home with support.\n\nHowever in Glasgow, the Integration Joint Board is planning a new 15-bed, long-term care home.\n\nCritics say this runs contrary to decades of learning and policy.\n\nJan Savage, head of campaigns and policy at Enable, said she would not want to criticise individual boards but that in principle Scotland needed to go in the right direction in terms of how and where people with learning disabilities were housed.\n\nShe said it was possible for everyone to be supported at home rather than in institutions.\n\nMs Savage said: \"The direction of travel has to be that as a society we agree we have to do better.\n\n\"We agree with the policy position that has been in place for the past 20 years that people have right to live in their own homes supported by the people they want to support them.\"\n\n'Stepping stone'\n\nA spokeswoman for Glasgow's Integration Joint Board said the plans were for a small, community based service for people with the most complex disabilities and who are assessed as needing complex care.\n\nThey said it would be a \"stepping stone\" from long-term hospital care into the community for those who were not yet ready to move into ordinary housing.\n\nThe spokeswoman said it would prevent some people having to move out of Glasgow to access a specialist care home as well as allowing people currently outside the city to move back.\n\n\"The whole ethos of the centre will be to assist people to live as independently as possible and to move on to other community-based options when they are able to do so,\" she said.\n\n\"However, there is a very small number of people for whom this may not be possible.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "2018/11/22 00:00 GMT", "description": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w172w4f3dw3yv5c", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p060dh18.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T00:06:00Z", "content": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "fulltext": "Sorry, this episode is not currently available"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "BBC News", "title": "Could HoloLens tech help save babies\u2019 lives?", "description": "Students are shown virtual reality images to teach them about obstetric emergencies.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/technology-46223467/could-hololens-tech-help-save-babies-lives", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DEA4/production/_104369965_p06rzr5l.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T00:01:31Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Video\n\nFor the first time in the UK, midwifery students are using Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens technology as part of their training.\n\nStudents at Middlesex University are shown virtual reality images of what is happening inside the anatomy, with the aim to teach them about all the obstetric emergencies that could occur.\n\nThe technology costs tens of thousands of pounds, but can it really be a substitute for experience from real-world training?\n\nBBC Click finds out more.\n\nSee more at Click's website and @BBCClick."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Half of university tuition fees spent on teaching", "description": "University students need more open information about fees -
