That showed his mental strength.\n\nI was impressed with how he started the match, obviously he was the underdog, he lost in straight sets to Novak a couple of days ago, and he didn't blink.\n\nHe held his serve easily - regularly hitting serves up to 140mph and finding the target with a high first-serve percentage - and made Novak start to worry.\n\nHe wasn't afraid of getting into the long rallies, Novak seemed to be puffing a lot, a lot of running was done, he seemed to be on a mission.\n\nNobody can stay with Novak normally in long rallies but Sascha did and that frustrated Novak.\n\nNow he has to do this consistently in five-set matches at the Grand Slams.\n\nLendl can take Zverev to the top\n\nLendl has been coaching Zverev since August\n\nAs the head of German men's tennis I've been mentoring Sascha for the last two-and-a-half years so I have practised and travelled with him many times and know him very well.\n\nHe is a curious 21-year-old, he walks through life with an open mind and an open perspective.\n\nOften he has asked me about what it takes to win. I've told him it is one thing winning a match or two and reaching a quarter-final, and another being successful at a major event like the ATP finals and Grand Slam.\n\nI talk to him about the old days, when I won Grand Slams, ATP Finals and was number one in the world, what I did in those certain situations.\n\nZverev is the first German winner of the ATP Finals since Becker in 1995\n\nSo I'm happy he now has Ivan Lendl as a coach because Ivan, who won eight Grand Slam titles, can tell him the same stories I can tell him and brings an understanding of the game to his team.\n\nWe have a lot of coaches, and no disrespect to them, but in order to win Grand Slam matches and become number one in the world it is easier to talk to people who have been there and about their own experiences.\n\nOften it is a small margin and when you have someone on the sideline who has been there it has a big effect.\n\nIt is very brave for Sascha to ask someone like Lendl to join his coaching team.\n\nIt shows you Sascha's motivation and his goals for the future. He wants to win and be the best so he is surrounding himself with the best.\n\nZverev's best performances at Grand Slams Australian Open Third round (2017, 2018) French Open Quarter-finals (2018) Wimbledon Fourth round (2017) US Open Third round (2018)\n\nDjokovic could dominate next year\n\nDespite losing against Zverev, Novak has shown over the past week - and few months - that he is back to his very best.\n\nThere is not much difference between the Novak we have seen recently and the Novak who topped the world rankings for 122 weeks, and held all four Grand Slam titles, at his peak in 2015 and 2016.\n\nTo come back after a difficult start to the year and an injury to win Wimbledon and the US Open this year, and become the dominant player in the second half of the year, speaks volumes for his mentality and love for the game.\n\nAs his former coach, it is wonderful for me to see that because he obviously still has a lot of good tennis in him.\n\nI think the time he had off earlier in the year rejuvenated him and made him realise how beautiful tennis is and how much he still has to give. He is more mature.\n\nHis serving is very good at the moment, he has shortened his swing to protect the elbow injury and that works in his favour.\n\nCan he dominate the men's game next year? Why not. He is playing amazing tennis."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "England to face India in semis after last-over defeat by West Indies", "description": "England will play India in the Women's World Twenty20 semi-finals after narrowly losing a fluctuating final group game against West Indies.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/46256644", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/15EE5/production/_104392898_britneycooper_getty_1.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T23:09:01Z", "content": "ICC Women's Twenty20, St Lucia England: 115-8 (20 overs): Dunkley 35, Shrubsole 29 West Indies: 117-6 (19.3 overs) : Dottin 46, Campbelle 45 West Indies won by four wickets Scorecard England will play India in the Women's World Twenty20 semi-finals after a na\u2026 [+2119 chars]", "fulltext": "Media playback is not supported on this device Highlights - Windies edge England in last-over thriller\n\nICC Women's Twenty20, St Lucia England: 115-8 (20 overs): Dunkley 35, Shrubsole 29 West Indies: 117-6 (19.3 overs): Dottin 46, Campbelle 45 Shrubsole 3-10 West Indies won by four wickets Scorecard\n\nEngland will play India in the Women's World Twenty20 semi-finals after a narrow defeat in their final Group A game against West Indies in St Lucia.\n\nAfter losing six wickets in the first 10 overs, England posted 115-8 thanks to an excellent partnership between Anya Shrubsole and Sophia Dunkley.\n\nShrubsole took two wickets in her first over, but Deandra Dottin and Shemaine Campbelle steadied the hosts.\n\nThe defending champions won with three balls to spare and face Australia next.\n\nBoth semi-finals will take place on Thursday, with the West Indies match starting at 20:00 GMT and England's beginning about four hours later.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device 'It's so close, it's unreal' England's Jones has lucky escape\n\nEngland were put in to bat by the hosts and were quickly in trouble when Danni Wyatt was caught at mid-off from the bowling of Shakera Selman in the first over.\n\nThey stuttered to 50-6 off 10 overs, but after Britney Cooper's brilliant run-out dismissed Lauren Winfield for a duck, Shrubsole and Dunkley moved England towards a competitive total with a seventh-wicket stand of 58.\n\nBoth batters hit a six apiece, with Shrubsole falling to the final ball of the innings when Dottin pulled off an outstanding catch diving to her right.\n\nShrubsole's excellent form continued when she took the ball for the second over of the West Indies reply, bowling Hayley Matthews with her first delivery and Stafanie Taylor with her fourth.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Shrubsole bowls Matthews & Taylor in second over\n\nShrubsole's hat-trick had inspired England to victory over South Africa in their third match, but this time Dottin calmed their opponents by hitting 46.\n\nLeft-arm spinner Kirstie Gordon tied down and then dismissed Dottin, but Campbelle picked up the scoring rate to take West Indies near to victory, and was missed by Dunkley off a steepling chance in the penultimate over.\n\nIt was a frantic finish at the Darren Sammy Stadium, with substitute Fran Wilson allowing a catching chance to go through her hands and then for four, and keeper Amy Jones also dropping a skier - although in the aftermath Cooper was run out by an alert Winfield.\n\nShrubsole stepped up for the final over with five needed by the West Indies, but after dismissing Campbelle for 45, she saw her next delivery sent to the point boundary by Kycia Knight to give the hosts victory with three balls to spare.\n\nIn the other Group A match, South Africa beat Bangladesh by 30 runs as they finished third and bottom respectively.\n\nSouth Africa made 109-9 before their opponents could only reach 79-5 in their 20 overs.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device World T20: Fantastic fielding, funky hats & Windies win England epic\n\nEngland captain Heather Knight on BBC Test Match Special: \"What a game of cricket, what a great atmosphere - I couldn't be more proud of the fight they showed.

I wasn't returning well,\" Djokovic said. \"I wasn't making him move too much. I was making way too many unforced errors.\n\n\"From 4-4 in the first set, my game fell apart. But if we put things in perspective it has been an amazing year and a great comeback.\"\n\nA big step up for Zverev - analysis\n\nZverev landed 72% of his first serves even though he was regularly touching speeds of 140mph\n\nBBC Sport tennis correspondent Russell Fuller\n\nZverev was so good in the first set - serving consistently at over 140mph - that Djokovic looked punch drunk in the second.\n\nThe world number one had played an almost perfect match against Kevin Anderson on Saturday, but after his serve was broken three times in a row, his belief drained.\n\nZverev has already won three Masters events, but this title is a step up. The next step is a Grand Slam: Ivan Lendl is now helping his dad with the coaching and, for the record, Roger Federer had not won a Grand Slam at the age Zverev is now.\n\nThere should be a lot to look forward to in 2019. Djokovic has dominated the second half of the season, but the only three players to have beaten him since the beginning of Wimbledon are no more than 22 years old.\n\n'Surpass Djokovic? Let's chill out a bit'\n\nDjokovic believes Zverev's win could have deeper significance for the men's game, with the world number one saying he \"deserves everything he gets\".\n\n\"There's a lot of similarities in terms of trajectory of professional tennis in our careers,\" added Djokovic. \"Hopefully he can surpass me. I mean, I sincerely wish him that.\"\n\nBut Zverev played down catching the 14-time major champion, who has won 72 career titles - five of those coming at the ATP Finals.\n\n\"I hope I can do great. But just chill out a little bit,\" said the German.\n\n\"I mean, I've won one of those. He won five. He's won, I don't know what, 148 titles more than me. Let's not go there for now.\"\n\nAnd Zverev talked up the presence of the only other players to have beaten Djokovic since the start of this year's Wimbledon - 22-year-old Russian Karen Khachanov and Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas, 20.\n\n\"Us young guys, we're coming through. Khachanov winning the Masters in Paris was a big thing. I was very happy for him. I wasn't happy that he beat me, but I was happy for the victory that he had because I'm quite good friends with him,\" he said.\n\n\"The victory for Tsitsipas in Toronto, I felt like Novak wasn't playing his best there, but obviously all the credit to Tsitsipas. You have to beat someone like Novak because he's not going to give you the match.\n\n\"It's great, but the future, we still got multiple and multiple years for all of us ahead. A lot of things can happen. A lot of things can change. I'll do everything I can to be on top. But the other guys are playing great tennis as well.\"\n\nGame, set and stats\u2026\n\nZverev is the first player to beat both Djokovic and Federer in the same ATP Finals\n\nHe is also the first to beat the top two seeds in the semi-finals and final of the event since Andre Agassi in 1990\n\nZverev, aged 21 years and six months, is the youngest champion at the ATP Finals since Djokovic in 2008\n\nZverev is the first German winner since Boris Becker in 1995\n\nRecent ATP finals 2017: Grigor Dimitrov beat David Goffin 2016: Andy Murray beat Novak Djokovic 2015: Novak Djokovic beat Roger Federer 2014: Novak Djokovic beat Roger Federer 2013: Novak Djokovic beat Rafael Nadal 2012: Novak Djokovic beat Roger Federer\n\nDoubles victory for Bryan & Sock\n\nSock and Bryan clinched victory with their sixth match point, having also saved one during a dramatic tie-break\n\nMike Bryan and Jack Sock won the doubles title in thrilling fashion, coming from a set down to beat French pair Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut 5-7 6-1 13-11.\n\nBryan, 40, only paired up with Sock in June because brother Bob, with whom he has won 16 Grand Slam titles and Olympic gold, is currently recovering from a hip injury."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Single-use plastic: 'Fish and chips must help save our seas'", "description": "A fish and chip shop is looking to make the British staple more environmentally friendly.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46116353", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/128E3/production/_104230067_fishman.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T19:14:10Z", "content": "Image copyright Matthew Williams Image caption The Crispy Cod will represent Wales at the National Fish and Chip Awards 2019 An award-winning fish and chip shop has called for takeaways to do more to protect the seas.

It was a heartbreaking\u2026 [+1211 chars]", "fulltext": "NI keeper Trevor Carson was beaten as Austria snatched victory seconds from the end of the match\n\nA Valentino Lazaro goal with the last kick of the game won the Nations League clash for Austria against Northern Ireland at Windsor Park.\n\nIt was a heartbreaking end after what had been a positive performance from Michael O'Neill's side.\n\nThey looked set for their first point of the competition when Corry Evans hit a 57th-minute equaliser after Xaver Schlager's goal eight minutes earlier.\n\nNorthern Ireland have lost all four matches in the new Uefa competition.\n\nThe hosts knew they were relegated from the Nations League Group B3 before Sunday's kick-off, but they had wanted to try to end 2018 on a high.\n\nAnd, while the home fans will have recognised their efforts to do so, the high-energy atmosphere for which Windsor Park is renowned was somewhat lacking.\n\nThe late goal was a cruel blow for Northern Ireland who have now won only twice in their last 13 matches\n\nThe 17,895- crowd roused themselves after the equaliser and welcomed the second-half introduction of Kyle Lafferty, but it never threatened to become the most memorable of nights at the south Belfast ground.\n\nAfter a first half in which Niall McGinn came closest to scoring when he curled a free-kick inches wide, Austria took a 49th-minute lead after an impressive left-wing move.\n\nBayern Munich's David Alaba cleverly left the pass inside and Schlager swept home a low left foot shot into the bottom corner for his first international goal.\n\nEvans' equaliser was his second goal for Northern Ireland and came 45 games after his first in 2010.\n\nGeorge Saville pressed well in midfield and the ball came to Jordan Jones on the left wing, who slipped it inside to Evans whose deflected left-foot shot deceived goalkeeper Heinz Lindner.\n\nUltimately, though, it counted for little as Lazaro curled a perfectly-directed shot beyond the outstretched Trevor Carson and into the top corner to secure the Austrians' first win in Belfast at the fifth attempt.\n\nSuperb Saville already a fans' favourite\n\nNorthern Ireland midfielder George Saville was man of the match against Austria\n\nHe has been earmarked by some Northern Ireland fans as the long-term successor to captain Steven Davis in the Northern Ireland midfield, and that may well prove to be the case for George Saville.\n\nBut the Middlesbrough man, who was introduced to the team towards the end of the last World Cup qualifying campaign, has already formed a fine axis with the skipper in a three-man engine room with scorer Corry Evans.\n\nSaville was superb once again in the middle of the park for O'Neill, closing the Austrians down throughout and even more impressive as a driving force when in possession.\n\nHis pressing helped lead to Evans' goal and he almost put his side 2-1 up in the 76th minute. He got on the ball 20 yards from goal and hit a searching shot with his cultured left foot that curled just wide of the post.\n\nOliver Norwood was suspended for this game and may find it difficult to force his way back into the midfield, with Davis once again a huge influence on the team and Evans proving his worth with the goal.\n\nNI manager's change of style\n\nO'Neill's side had a definite style of play for the recent Euro and World Cup qualifying campaigns. The team had a compact shape, was often happy to surrender possession and look to hurt the opposition on the break.\n\nWith the utmost attention paid to every detail by the manager, it was a percentage game that may not have been easy on the eye of the neutral, but which proved effective.\n\nAn equaliser by Corry Evans did not save Michael O'Neill's men from another Nations League defeat\n\nThe ball moved from back to front quickly, often to target man Kyle Lafferty, and Northern Ireland reaped a lot of joy from well-rehearsed set-pieces.\n\nThere has been a noticeable change of style from O'Neill this season, with a much greater focus on possession and building attacks from the back. That element has been successful but they had failed to score in five of their last six competitive matches before Sunday night.\n\nNorthern Ireland once again looked comfortable on the ball against Austria, but, unlike in Thursday night's friendly in Dublin, they did not create many clear-cut chances.\n\nO'Neill has four months to think about how his side continues to evolve before they start their Euro qualifier campaign in March.\n\nFood for thought at full-back\n\nOne of the most surprising elements of Michael O'Neill's team selection was his deployment of Stuart Dallas at left-back, although the Leeds United winger produced a solid display until he was robbed of possession in the build-up to Lazaro's winner.\n\nThe choice of Michael Smith on the other side of the back four was perhaps less surprising, given how well he performed against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on what was only his second start.\n\nStuart Dallas was asked to take on a defensive role against Austria\n\nThe Hearts defender once again looked assured in a position which has been filled most often in recent years by Millwall's Conor McLaughlin. Bayern Munich's David Alaba was a threat for the Austrians down the left flank but Smith stuck to his task well against the Bundesliga forward.\n\nSmith and Dallas were playing in a defence that welcomed back Gareth McAuley after he missed the last five internationals. The crowd favourite received a warm reception from the home fans and the Rangers centre-half was his reliable self alongside Leicester City's Jonny Evans.\n\nMcAuley took the place of Watford regular Craig Cathcart who has been in fine form for club and country of late.\n\nO'Neill has used a back three before but with the way the team is evolving, it looks more like he will have a few decisions to make in his defence come March.\n\nKicking the losing habit\n\nWhile Northern Ireland's World Cup qualifying campaign ended in dismay when they went out to a controversial Switzerland goal in a play-off, the results and performances in the group maintained the positive momentum generated at the Euros in 2016.\n\nBut now they have gone eight competitive games without a win, losing seven and drawing one.\n\nWhile the evolution of their style of play has been positive, they are stuck in the habit of losing meaningful matches which they will need to address in 2019.\n\nManager O'Neill said throughout the Nations League that the Euros was his main focus and all thoughts will now turn to the draw in Dublin on 2 December.\n\nRun without a win goes on - the stats\n\nNorthern Ireland are winless in their last eight competitive games (D1 L7), their worst run since going nine without victory between September 2011 and March 2013.\n\nAustria scored with both of their shots on target in this game, courtesy of Xaver Schlager and Valentin Lazaro. Neither player had previously scored for their country.\n\nAfter keeping a clean sheet in four consecutive competitive home games, Northern Ireland have conceded in each of their last four.\n\nCorry Evans' equaliser was Northern Ireland's first goal in 350 minutes of action since Gavin Whyte netted in the 67th minute against Israel in September.\n\nEvans scored his first goal for Northern Ireland since September 2010 versus Slovenia, 2998 days ago.\n\nAustria's Marko Arnautovic has been directly involved in 26 goals (15 goals and 11 assists) in 37 games for club and country in 2018, compared to 19 involvements in 44 games in 2017 (13 goals and six assists)."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "World Falconry Day: Eagle and falcons soar over desert show", "description": "Egyptian falconers meet in the desert to celebrate World Falconry Day and highlight an ancient sport.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-46255980", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3F5B/production/_104391261_050689876-1.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T18:54:18Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Image caption\n\nThey soared through the sky to swoop on pigeons and rabbits in front of the spectators."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "France's Macron: Europe must unite to prevent 'global chaos'", "description": "Speaking in Berlin, France's president said Europe stands at a crossroads, and urged closer EU ties.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46254393", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1909/production/_104390460_macrongermany.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T18:33:39Z", "content": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The French president was speaking on the occasion of Volkstrauertag, Germany's national day of mourning for victims of war France's President Emmanuel Macron has called for closer ties between his country and Germany\u2026 [+2467 chars]", "fulltext": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The French president was speaking on the occasion of Volkstrauertag, Germany's national day of mourning for victims of war\n\nFrance's President Emmanuel Macron has called for closer ties between his country and Germany, saying Europe \"has the obligation not to let the world slip into chaos\".\n\nMr Macron is in Berlin for the country's annual day of mourning for victims of war.\n\nIn a speech to Germany's parliament, he said Europe must not \"become a plaything of great powers\".\n\nMr Macron wants a more integrated EU, with a joint eurozone budget.\n\nHe also wants Germany's backing for a European Army, which he has said would reduce the bloc's dependence on the US, and a new tax on internet tech giants.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel has expressed tentative support for some of these ideas, but others are controversial in Berlin.\n\n'Our true strength lies in unity'\n\nThe French leader spoke of nationalist forces \"with no memory\", and urged progressive forces to unite in an uncertain world.\n\n\"There are too many powers that wish to thwart us, that interfere in our public debates, attack our liberal democracies and are trying to pit us against each other,\" he said. \"And in this global order, which we have to take very seriously, our strength - our true strength - lies in unity.\"\n\nUS President Donald Trump was moved to a Twitter tirade by similar remarks from Mr Macron a week ago, when the French leader called nationalism a \"betrayal of patriotism\" while commemorating the end of World War One.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption President Trump and President Putin were among the leaders at the ceremony in Paris\n\nThe French president acknowledged that unity could be \"scary,\" and would mean nations pooling their funds and decision-making - but then asked: \"Is it better to remain locked at a standstill?\"\n\nThe French and German leaders met for talks after Mr Macron's speech, and were set to discuss migration, defence co-operation and tax structures for digital companies.\n\nFrance and Germany are expected to unveil plans for a limited joint eurozone budget on Monday.\n\n\"You made clear with an impressive speech how important the German-Franco friendship and co-operation is, and what role it plays in the European context,\" Mrs Merkel told Mr Macron.\n\n\"You said we are at a crossroads... and this is exactly what I perceive.

He was on the lowest level of funding from British Athletics, receiving approximately \u00a37,000 a year.\n\nIt's not a great deal of cash but it's not nice to have it taken away from you, especially just before Christmas. A lot people think sport is a glamorous lifestyle and you're on megabucks, but we're not, we're scraping to get by. We're not like football or rugby players, we get the bare minimum.\n\nI now have to find the cash to continue - so that's maybe another 15 or 20 hours a week that I've got to work. It will take its toll eventually.\n\nI have to be honest and admit that I didn't meet those targets. As an athlete you have to take responsibility and, if you're not performing, you don't deserve the money in my eyes.\n\nI actually said to the guys at British Athletics, 'it'll be an absolute crime if you keep me on'. I had high hopes of getting a medal at the Commonwealths but I bottled it and I'm not afraid of admitting that.\n\nI had a knee injury and they offered me an operation, but I still had to compete. I was on Tramadol trying to get myself through the season.\n\nBennett finished 12th in the hammer final at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games in 2014\n\n'I felt like I didn't belong at the Olympics'\n\nBennett believes not enough consideration is paid to issues occurring behind the scenes in sport. In the two years leading up to the Glasgow Commonwealth Games, both his father and his coach passed away, events which led to him \"going off the rails a wee bit\" and affected his mental health.\n\nI lost my dad in 2012 really unexpectedly. He had always been ill. He was a lift engineer and they gave him the wrong ladder and he fell on his head, which caused Petit Mal epilepsy (also called 'absence seizures'). He went in for a routine prostate exam and the medication they gave him counteracted his seizure medication.\n\nThen I went into training in April 2013 and two weeks later my coach died of liver cancer. He'd been there for two weeks and hadn't missed a session.\n\nBefore I went to Australia, I had this massive feeling that I was going to wake up one day and my mum wouldn't be there. It sounds bad for a guy at 28 to say that but when you've only got one parent left, that's a really hard thing to deal with.\n\nI was at rock bottom, I saw a psychologist a lot to just get my feelings and thoughts out there. It's okay to talk. At times I was depressed.\n\nThe Olympics was the best and the worst time ever for me. The worst side of it was that I felt so outside of my comfort zone. I was stuck in a small room with all the coaching staff and I remember thinking \"I just don't want to be here at all\". I didn't feel worthy of being there, I didn't feel part of it, I didn't feel part of the team.\n\n'I'm not going to retire until I've done it on a big stage'\n\nDespite the disappointment of losing his funding, Bennett believes it could actually turn into a positive, giving him the \"kick up the backside that I needed\". He is in a much better place than he was previously and is determined to be a success. He can now look back and joke about the low points of his career.\n\nYou have to see the lighter side of it.

The victory also guarantees England a place in the Euro 2020 play-offs, a fallback in the event they fail to qualify for that tournament through the traditional route.\n\nSouthgate can take his share of the credit for two attacking substitutions, sending on Lingard and Jadon Sancho with England's backs against the wall, the reward coming in the shape of that decisive late rally.\n\nIt hardly counts as retribution for the disappointment of the World Cup semi-final but it was a demonstration this England side is developing under Southgate, this victory acting as a measure of their progress.\n\nEngland embrace the Uefa Nations League\n\nEngland defenders Kyle Walker (left in top photo) and Joe Gomez after Croatia's goal and then at the end of the match\n\nThe obvious joy of England's players and supporters after that dramatic finale was another indicator the Uefa Nations League, mocked and maligned at its inception, is capturing the public's imagination.\n\nIt is not yet close to being ready to be spoken about in the same breath as the major tournaments such as the World Cup and the Euros - but England's adventure so far has produced hard evidence the idea behind its creation - to add an extra edge beyond traditional friendlies - has been a success.\n\nThe atmosphere inside Wembley when England went a goal behind was testament to this, with the crowd clearly aware of the consequences and what Southgate's men required to avoid the worst fate.\n\nThe group situation added an extra layer of tension and atmosphere, contributing to a memorable conclusion.\n\nThe Nations League results have also seen England respond to an ongoing criticism they fail to beat the top sides, with even Southgate insisting they could not be considered among the world's elite until they beat the best. The World Cup did nothing to answer those questions.\n\nNow, in this increasingly competitive environment, they have recorded significant wins away to Spain and now at home to the team that outmanoeuvred them in Moscow.\n\nEngland and Wembley embraced this new format - and relished in the occasion.\n\nMusic to Croatia's ears?\n\nEngland's 'Football Coming Home' anthem became a serious bone of contention at the World Cup - with Croatia using it as a sign of arrogance from their opponents in the build-up to the semi-final.\n\nThat was harsh and misleading as the song was actually written as a hymn to England's failures and disappointments in the lead-up to staging Euro '96 on home soil.\n\nIn Russia, it worked to fire up Croatia even if it was unfair on England as the message was twisted.\n\nWas it mischievous, then, that the strains of the song were belted out over Wembley's public address system at deafening volume the second the final whistle sounded and was instantly joined by thousands of celebrating England fans?\n\nNo-one should count this as revenge for the World Cup but England and their supporters took great satisfaction in overcoming notoriously difficult opponents.\n\nMan of the match - Joe Gomez (England)\n\nKane ends barren run - the stats\n\nEngland have won four of their past five matches (D1), having won just one of their six before that (D1 L4).\n\nThis was Croatia's first defeat against England since September 2009, when they lost 5-1 in a World Cup qualifier at Wembley.\n\nKane ended a run of 747 minutes without an England goal, scoring his first since his penalty against Colombia at the World Cup. This was his 20th England goal.\n\nLingard's goal for England was their first goal via a throw-in since May 2014 (Daniel Sturridge v Peru).\n\nKramaric scored with Croatia's first shot on target of the match.\n\nLingard has scored as many goals in his past two England matches (two) as he managed in his first 20 caps for the Three Lions.\n\nEngland have won 15 of their past 16 competitive matches at Wembley (L1).\n\nThis was England's 17th game in 2018 - their joint-most matches in a calendar year, also playing 17 times in 1966.\n\nWhat they said\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate on BBC Radio 5 live: \"I think the most pleasing thing of the year has been the connection with the fans and being able to share brilliant experiences with them.\n\n\"Today was brilliant - I can't remember the new Wembley like that. We have exciting players that give them excitement.\n\n\"We were by far the better team in the first half and we came back from a soft goal. If you're going to win a game that's the way you want to win.\n\n\"We were playing against a very, very good side. To keep the ball, use the ball and create chances was very pleasing. And you have to keep calm - when you think the chances have gone then you have to keep believing.\"\n\nEngland striker Harry Kane on BBC Radio 5 live, talking about where his winning goal ranks: \"It's right up there. To see the fans like they were and the belief they showed. It's all about having match-winners in the squad.\n\n\"It's one of England's best years. We could win a trophy.\n\n\"To carry the momentum into the new year... we've had a fantastic year, but not rested on our laurels.\"\n\nEngland goalkeeper Jordan Pickford on BBC Radio 5 live: \"The atmosphere is probably the best we've had at Wembley, so credit to the fans.\n\n\"This Nations League makes you want to beat the best. We've beaten two of the top 10 sides in the world.

They [Albania] went down to 10 men early and sometimes that can work in their favour and not in ours, but we did well, we kept the ball, and when I came off it was good to just sit back and watch them passing the ball about; they were very good.\"\n\n'Hopefully I can push them through this group'\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Watch: Steven Fletcher now sees Scotland's quality\n\nScotland now face Israel at Hampden on Tuesday, where a win would ensure they top Group C1 and earn a play-off spot.\n\n\"It's a big game, but we know that,\" added Fletcher. \"Obviously we put in a big performance today and we can take confidence from that.\n\n\"With my injury I was out for a long time, so I just set my mind on getting back at club level and trying to get back fit and playing, and I managed to do that. I've been putting in good performances at club level and the manager has seen that.\n\n\"I'm glad he gave me the call when he did. At my age I'm going to jump at the chance to get a few more caps and hopefully push them through this group.\"\n\nAnalysis - Fletcher 'a very clever footballer'\n\nDundee's former Rangers & Scotland striker Kenny Miller on Sportsound:\n\n\"Fletcher was not blessed with blistering pace but he has always had a very good technique. He is a very clever footballer.\n\n\"He might not have been in the squad had everyone been available but I thought he was great. There is not a great deal of experience when you look through the team, but he brought something to it and got his 10th international goal - albeit a penalty - which was fully deserved.\n\n\"He held the ball up well and with his all-round game, he sucked in defenders which allowed the wingers to get into the space behind.\n\n\"They have found a system now which I think suits us. It allows wingers to be wingers, to be really aggressive going forward. They don't have to play wing-back and use a lot of energy getting back.\n\n\"They still put in a shift but they have a team-mate behind them now. A lot more of their energy can be used to do what they do well, which is creating and scoring goals and using their pace to dribble with the ball.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Great Escape pilot's caterpillar pin sells at auction", "description": "Bram Van der Stok, who escaped Stalag Luft III, was given the pin for his wartime service.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-46246552", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E810/production/_104380495_image-2.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T13:10:36Z", "content": "Image copyright Lockdales Image caption Chris Elmy of Lockdales with the Caterpillar Club lapel pin A gold pin given to a pilot who escaped a notorious prisoner of war camp has sold at auction for more than five times its estimate.

They know how to win and have done so with aplomb against stellar countries, but however many major days Gregor Townsend has had as a coach, he'll know that the total could have been a whole lot more.\n\nSouth Africa on Saturday was one of those. Wales earlier in the month was another. Ireland in the Six Nations, though eventually a 20-point loss, might have been an altogether different story had Scotland not butchered so many chances and given up some soft points. Even New Zealand this time last year can fall into the category. Scotland had 60% possession and 65% territory that day.\n\nIt was, to borrow a phrase from Stuart McInally in the wake of the loss to the Springboks, \"one that got away\".\n\nIs it harsh to criticise Scotland for not beating South Africa? Old school thinking would say yes, but that's the thought process of Scotland knowing its place and taking great pride in moral victories, the thought process of failure. If we criticise, we do it from a point of believing that they're capable of better.\n\nUnder Vern Cotter, Scotland moved on. Under Townsend, they have kept on moving. Now, you turn up to Murrayfield with a level of expectation, no matter who they're up against. They've worked hard to get to this stage. This is a dangerous rugby team we're taking about, albeit one that still has a lot of growing up to do.\n\nPete Horne's try against the Springboks was another classic in a growing list of classics. The speed of thought, the sleight of hand, the accuracy, the support lines - majestic.\n\nHuw Jones was quite brilliant in that moment. Sean Maitland was exceptional also. Scotland can do that to any team on the planet and it's an utter joy to watch. Their journey these past few years has taken them from soft touches to live threats. The next part of the journey into the land of serial winners was always going to be the toughest, however.\n\nDid South Africa win this Test or did Scotland lose it? A bit of both, but possibly more of the latter than the former. They had chances. Oh, how they had chances.\n\nEarly in the second half they were gifted 10 minutes with a one-man advantage after Willie le Roux was harshly binned. Greig Laidlaw banged over the ensuing penalty to make it 20-20 but then Scotland failed to deal with the restart and coughed up a penalty of their own which Handre Pollard put over to restore the lead.\n\nA fumbled restart, impetus for the Springboks, three points and a psychological boost for the visitors. These are little things, but add them all together and they're very big things.\n\nThat spell with Le Roux in the bin ended 3-3 and it would have been 6-3 to the Boks had Pollard not hit a post with a second penalty. An opportunity wasted for Scotland. Others followed. Jones made a terrific break out of defence in the 55th minute, but in the aftermath the ball was kicked away instead of being kept alive.\n\nIn the 59th minute, and trailing by three points, Scotland had a kickable penalty but they kicked for touch. It wasn't a bad decision as long as something came of it, but they lost the ball and the spirit of the Boks soared again.\n\nSouth Africa were brutish, as we knew they would be. They battled ferociously, defended brilliantly, and won a resounding victory in the breakdown battle. They didn't play much, if any, rugby in that second half. They made the game an ugly arm wrestle.\n\nEven then, Scotland had opportunities. Two minutes from time they had an attacking lineout in the Springbok 22 but it went wrong, They won a penalty directly after and went back to touch to launch another maul. That was their moment to pull off the victory but the maul went south, the Boks survived, and here we are again talking about what-might-have-beens.\n\nPeter Horne scored an impressive try for Scotland against South Africa\n\nLater in the evening, Ireland beat the All Blacks for the second time in two years. Even in the white heat of a top-of-the-world war of attrition, Ireland's error count was tiny. They played with a controlled fury for 80 minutes. This is not how Scotland play the game and trying to ape it would be doomed to failure. There is a message, though.\n\nScotland have won a lot of games with their brilliance. They've also won big games by digging deep and defending magnificently. To get the consistency to launch a championship-winning bid, however, they need more.\n\nThere is a requisite amount of power you need up front and though Scotland have many fine things in their armoury, they need extra badness in their pack to take the next step, the kind of qualities that Ireland had in Cian Healy, Tadhg Furlong, Peter O'Mahony and CJ Stander on Saturday night, the 'run-through-your-granny' belligerence that all winners have.\n\nFive years ago the Irish team was in crisis having won just a single game in the Six Nations.

Sorry Olly.\n\nBruce Forsyth and Strictly Come Dancing\n\nImage caption The late, great Bruce Forsyth waltzed away from Strictly in 2014\n\nIt doesn't always go well when you lose a presenter (we'll get to that later) but Strictly made it seamless.\n\nBruce was 86 and 11 series into Strictly when he decided he'd rather watch the show with his slippers on at home. Claudia Winkleman, former host of spin-off show It Takes Two, was given a promotion.\n\nShe'd already taken over presenting the results show from Bruce two years earlier.\n\n\"Bruce stepped down so there was no backlash against Claudia,\" TV critic Emma Bullimore tells Newsbeat.\n\n\"Claudia was a friend of the show like Holly is a friend of Ant and Dec, so it feels very organic, very natural and what you might expect to happen.\"\n\nThe ratings have continued to soar and, while it's big rival The X Factor has struggled, Strictly is now the undisputed king of Saturday night.\n\nDermot O'Leary and The X Factor\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Dermot's departure didn't go well for The X Factor. At all.\n\nHere's how not to do it. Even back in 2015, when it was announced that Dermot would be leaving The X Factor, the show was losing ratings.\n\nHe had proved really popular in the role after taking over from Kate Thornton in 2007.\n\nBut Simon seemed to decide that bringing in Olly Murs and Caroline Flack would be a good idea to freshen things up. It didn't work out.\n\nThe ratings didn't improve and Olly didn't seem to take to presenting. Remember when he told one contestant they were going home when it was actually going to deadlock? It was all very awkward.\n\n\"Presenting is a job which looks easy but is actually very difficult,\" TV critic Emma explains.\n\n\"X Factor viewers love Olly but it just didn't work. They tried to mix it up a bit, Simon's always looking for ways to do that since the show has been on the decline.\n\n\"He's been desperately trying to save it and that was an idea. At least props to Simon. After one series they said 'no this is ridiculous'. It just didn't go well.\"\n\nDermot came back a year later. Many of the viewers still haven't. The 2018 series has seen some of the lowest viewing figures in its history.\n\nClarkson, Hammond & May and Top Gear\n\nImage caption Jeremy Clarkson was dropped from Top Gear in 2015. Richard Hammond and James May quickly followed\n\nWhen Jeremy Clarkson's BBC contract wasn't renewed, after an \"unprovoked physical attack\" on a Top Gear producer, it brought to an end one of its most popular ever presenting line-ups.\n\nTop Gear has had many hosts over the years but the three presenters' chemistry in the Clarkson era saw the show soar to new heights.\n\nSince then Chris Evans came and went very quickly and that led to a decline in viewing figures. The critics weren't kind either.\n\nUnder a new trio of Matt LeBlanc, Chris Harris and Rory Reid, the show's reputation improved and the numbers crept back up slightly.\n\nBut Matt's now decided he's had enough so Take Me Out host Paddy McGuinness and ex-cricketer Andrew Flintoff will join Chris Harris for series 27.\n\nWho knows how this latest line-up will fare. Will it hit the heights of the Clarkson, Hammond and May era?\n\nThe Great British Bake off and Mel & Sue\n\nImage copyright BBC/Love Productions Image caption Mel, Paul Hollywood, Mary Berry, Sue and the cast of the last Bake Off to air on the BBC in 2016\n\nThe Great British Bake Off is the surprise hit of the 2010's - becoming one of the most watched shows on British TV.\n\nFans loved the chemistry between the judges and hosts. But, when the show switched from the BBC to Channel 4, there was an exodus.\n\nLove Productions, which makes Bakes Off, got a better offer from the commercial channel.\n\nMel and Sue quickly said they \"wouldn't follow the dough\" and Mary Berry quit too, leaving only Paul Hollywood remaining.\n\nThe ratings are lower but still healthy and new hosts Sandi Toksvig and Noel Fielding appeared to win round many fans.\n\n\"It became such a big shift that you either loved the format of the show and you were going to go with it, or you weren't,\" Emma says.\n\n\"Everyone loves how Mel and Sue hosted but Sandi and Noel don't do it that much differently. They like to say they do but really it's a very similar tone.\n\n\"I think it has worked. It's not quite as magical as it used to be, but it's still a great show.\"\n\nHolly Willoughby and I'm A Celebrity\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Ant, Holly and Dec are good mates, as seen here at an award ceremony in 2016\n\nSo how will Holly get on keeping Ant's jungle seat warm? Emma thinks viewers will stay with the show.\n\n\"What elevates I'm A Celebrity from other reality shows is that Ant and Dec take the mickey out of the contestants, like two little naughty boys giggling at them.\n\n\"It's an integral part of the show and people are very nervous about the fact that they won't be there together.\n\n\"But it's a needs must situation. What other choice did they have unless they were going to take the show off air?\n\n\"Holly has been very careful to say this is only for a year. No one think's she's trying to take's Ant's job. Holly is also very cheeky.

There are few players chosen to represent Benfica.\n\n\"When I accepted the invitation, of course my will was to play more and it was with that goal that I got back.

The mental pain of not being able to show the world her ability on a snowboard on the biggest stage of all.\n\nYet this comes from someone who has experienced her fair share of pain. A snapped anterior cruciate ligament and a broken back are among her extensive list of injuries, and she's had seven operations on this one alone.\n\n\"They were all paper cuts compared to this one,\" says the 21-year-old. \"Up until my last operation, I was in pain every day just walking about.\"\n\nOrmerod - an X-Games and multiple World Cup medallist - was one of Great Britain's greatest hopes before the Winter Olympics in South Korea, having won bronze at the test event.\n\nHowever, she came off a rail too early in training and her Games were over before they had even started - a fractured right heel ruling her out three days before she was due to compete.\n\nIn the nine months since, Ormerod has endured some of her darkest days - but at last she is pain free, physically and mentally.\n\nHere, she tells BBC Sport about her battle with depression, how she plans to grow women's snowboarding, and how pig and shark skin came into the equation.\n\nReflections on a nightmare day\n\nOrmerod training in Pyeongchang on the day she broke her heel\n\nOrmerod had already broken her wrist out in Pyeongchang - and it was on the same rail the following day that she snapped her heel in two.\n\n\"Straight away I knew my Olympics was over. It was the most horrendous pain I have ever felt and it was very traumatic,\" she says.\n\nMedics took more than an hour to remove her boot - they tried to cut through it but in the end were forced to pull it off - and it was her boyfriend, former New Zealand snowboard coach Lachie Good, who had to inform her of the severity of the injury.\n\n\"I was gutted because of all the hard work I had put in over the past four years and for it all to be taken away from me so quickly, in the most painful way possible, was awful,\" she adds.\n\n\"I just think it wasn't meant to be for me in Pyeongchang. I feel like it was always meant to happen.\"\n\nFighting for her career\n\nOrmerod had her first operation in South Korea to pin her heel back together, and she thought that would be her last.\n\n\"I felt so confident that I could do well and bring a medal back,\" she says. \"For that to be taken away from me in an instant was so hard for me to come to terms with.\n\n\"I struggled with it for a few months after.\"\n\nThose struggles turned into depression for a \"sad and confused\" Ormerod, who kept her emotions to herself and questioned her future.\n\n\"All I have ever known is snowboarding. I started when I was five and in my head I've always seen myself snowboarding for as long as physically possible,\" she says.\n\n\"I couldn't get to grips with the idea it could be career-ending. I really didn't want that to happen.\"\n\nOne quick glance through Ormerod's Instagram page and you would never think the dark clouds of depression had descended. But that, Ormerod says, is the problem with social media.\n\n\"It is not always real but I felt I had to be positive to help others,\" she adds.\n\nShe finally found the courage to voice her struggles - first to her parents, then to her team manager.\n\n\"I felt like I was the only one going through difficult times but, after four months, I realised one day that I wasn't the only athlete or person in the world going through it,\" she says.\n\n\"As soon as I started opening up, I felt better.\"\n\nSkin grafts - pig or shark?\n\nDoctors performed a skin graft using pig skin on Ormerod's ankle\n\nAfter every operation she's had, Ormerod has been sure it would be the last - in particular, the first one.\n\nBut upon her return home from South Korea in February, British surgeons found the skin on her heel had died through to the bone, complicating matters even more.\n\nThey were forced to perform a skin graft using skin from Ormerod's hip - as well as the skin of a pig.\n\n\"The doctor mentioned using shark skin but on the day of the operation he decided they would use pig skin instead,\" she says.\n\n\"It's really noticeable, I have a big dip in my ankle now and the skin is a lot darker.\"\n\nOrmerod had surgery for the seventh time in October to remove the screws holding her heel bone together after they were found to be aggravating her Achilles.\n\nFinally pain free, there is light at the end of the tunnel - she hopes to be back on her board early next year.\n\n\"I am really excited to be back. I got a small taste for it last month when I went out to Austria. Just being back in the mountains was the most amazing feeling and it made me realise just how much I missed it,\" she says.\n\n\"There is no way I could stop snowboarding and stop pushing myself because it is built in me.

and that work is ongoing to further develop service provision on mental health.\"\n\nWhere to get help\n\nIf you are in the UK, you can call the Samaritans on 116123 or Lifeline on 0808 808 8000.\n\nFor support and more information on emotional distress, click here."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "'My autistic son was taught he's not worth anything'", "description": "Thousands of children are dropping out of education after being 'off-rolled', unions and teachers say.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-46241852", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10335/production/_104375366_gettyimages-846460568.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T06:33:38Z", "content": "Image copyright Boston Globe Image caption Children with special educational needs are more likely to be taken off the school roll, experts say Julie becomes tearful when she starts talking about her autistic son's struggle to stay in school. \"He has been tau\u2026 [+4367 chars]", "fulltext": "Image copyright Boston Globe Image caption Children with special educational needs are more likely to be taken off the school roll, experts say\n\nJulie becomes tearful when she starts talking about her autistic son's struggle to stay in school. \"He has been taught that he's not worth anything,\" she says.\n\nSam, 14 - who loves animals and rebuilding computers - was temporarily excluded from secondary school in December 2015.\n\nJulie expected her son would be back in a matter of days. But he didn't go back to school for almost two and a half years.\n\nJulie says Sam was never permanently excluded, and was left in educational limbo.\n\nShe applied to eight schools - all of which Sam was rejected from. Julie says he was educated for as little as one hour a day at home by a teaching assistant.\n\n'Rejection'\n\nAnd for over a year, she says, he was simply taken out on day trips to pet shops and car showrooms by a \"personal assistant\" paid for by Sheffield City Council.\n\nSam can, by his mum's own admission, \"have a meltdown\" when stressed. But it was only when he went to secondary school that \"things changed really quickly\".\n\n\"Sam's mental health has suffered significantly. He has been taught that he's not worth anything. All he has been shown is rejection,\" she says.\n\n\"[Following the end of the home tutor] there was no education at all, there was no resources. Nothing.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nSam's case is now the subject of an internal investigation by Sheffield City Council and the school, which said: \"We want every child in Sheffield to be able to access the education that they need and it is never acceptable when this does not happen.\n\n\"We have been working with the family about this and are investigating the situation further to understand what has happened. We want to make sure that no other children in Sheffield are affected in the same way.\"\n\nBut unions and teachers have told 5 live Investigates that thousands of children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) are dropping out of education after being \"off-rolled\" - removed from a school's roll.\n\n'Snowed under'\n\nLorraine Dormand, is the head at Sam's new school, the National Autistic Society's Robert Ogden School.\n\nShe says she is pleased with Sam's progress - but adds that the school is \"snowed under\" with referrals for autistic children who have been informally and formally excluded from schools.\n\n\"It's deeply concerning and is of course very distressing for the children and their families. We are then left to pick up the pieces.\n\n\"We are seeing children who have been out of school for years, and the impact can be devastating. It can rob them of their self-confidence.\n\n\"They lose faith in the education system, and themselves. As a result of that, and a lack of understanding, too many autistic children end up excluded or off-rolled.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Repeated exclusion can be very distressing for autistic children and their families\n\nOfficial figures suggest almost 20,000 GCSE students left school rolls in 2017 - and almost a third had special educational needs.\n\nThe true scale of the problem is thought to be much higher, according to the National Education Union (NEU), the UK's leading teaching union.\n\n\"It is a terrible thing and it should not happen,\" says Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU.\n\n\"This is happening because of a toxic mix of league tables, inspection regimes and lack of funding. The majority of schools do their best. The problem is, some don't.\n\n\"I don't condone it. But I'm not surprised by it.\"\n\nNearly 4,500 pupils with autism were excluded from school in 2015-16 - a 60% increase since 2011.\n\nCoercing parents\n\nInspectors admit that when pupils are off-rolled, they can't always trace what happens to them.\n\n\"It is the case that sometimes we don't know where those pupils go; that is something that is concerning to us,\" says Daniel Owen, Ofsted inspector and the watchdog's national lead on behaviour, attendance and alternative provision.\n\n\"In some cases we suspect that school leaders are coercing parents to remove pupils or making decisions that are not in the best interests of the pupils,\" he added.\n\nA Department for Education spokesperson said that informal unofficial exclusions were \"unlawful and unacceptable.\"\n\nThe Timpson exclusions review, due to be published in the new year, is looking into why certain groups of pupils are more likely to be excluded than others, including those with SEND.\n\n5 live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 live, 18 November at 11:00 GMT - catch up on BBC Sounds"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "2018/11/18 06:00 GMT", "description": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w172w4f31lth3rl", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p060dh18.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T06:06:00Z", "content": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "fulltext": "Sorry, this episode is not currently available"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "2018/11/18 05:00 GMT", "description": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w172w4f31lth00g", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p060dh18.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T05:06:00Z", "content": "The latest five minute news bulletin from BBC World Service.", "fulltext": "Sorry, this episode is not currently available"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Sri Lanka v England: Moeen Ali and Jack Leach wrap up series win for tourists", "description": "Moeen Ali and Jack Leach bowl England to their first series win in Sri Lanka since 2001 with a 57-run victory in the second Test.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/46251695", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/13590/production/_97584297_breaking_news.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T05:00:38Z", "content": "Second Test, Pallekele (day five) England 290 &amp;

He talked before the series about wanting to be more \"courageous\" on subcontinental pitches and his team bought into it here.\n\nThey batted positively, mostly with calculated risk among some more rash shots, to put the pressure back on Sri Lanka's bowlers, while Root largely marshalled his spinners well and played the most decisive innings of the game with a sublime 124 on day three.\n\nThis is also the first time an England side have won all three series in all formats on tour, albeit they only played Sri Lanka in a one-off Twenty20.\n\n'A fantastic effort' - reaction & analysis\n\nEngland head coach Trevor Bayliss on Sky Sports: \"It is only England's second series win here. Coming here, playing a team in their home conditions - conditions that are foreign to us - it is a fantastic effort.\n\n\"The spinners were a bit below par in the first innings; we didn't get quite enough balls in the right areas. We spoke about that and, under pressure to perform in the second innings, they did a fantastic job.\n\n\"Both Rory Burns and Ben Foakes were playing in their second Tests but looked so calm. When they are batting it looks like they are playing in their 30th or 40th Test. That is a great sign going forward. That sends a message to the opposition. We knew Foakes was a very good keeper and he has proved it in this match.\"\n\nEx-England captain Michael Vaughan on The Cricket Social: \"They've won the key moments, the moments that matter, which is exactly what you need to do in Test match cricket.\n\n\"I don't remember seeing an England team with as much talent and that's why it's frustrating when we have performances like at Trent Bridge and at Lord's against Pakistan.\"\n\nBen Foakes (left) averages 76 with the bat in his first two Tests\n\nEngland slow left-armer Jack Leach: \"Unbelievable! It's a great feeling. These boys (Moeen and Adil Rashid) have helped me out so much. It was good to play on this wicket but, at other times, I felt it was tough.\"\n\nEngland leg-spinner Adil Rashid: \"It feels good to have three spinners in the team. We all know our roles and help each other out. It's nice to make history and hopefully we can carry that on now.\"\n\nSri Lanka captain Suranga Lakmal: \"Both sides played very good cricket. It's been a good five days and a very challenging wicket.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Mental health: Firms ask PM to deliver on pledge", "description": "Bosses ask the PM to honour a pledge to give mental health the same status as physical health at work.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46251391", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0490/production/_104386110_istock-532120664.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T04:46:47Z", "content": "Image copyright iStock Some of Britain's biggest employers are pressing the government to honour a promise to give mental health the same status as physical health at work.

Reality Check unpacks the basics.\n\nThe draft withdrawal agreement includes the option of extending it if more time is needed to reach a trade deal - but rather than specifying an end date, says a decision may be taken \"extending the transition period up to [31 December 20XX].\"\n\nAlso in the meeting there was a divide between states that want an ambitious trading relationship with the UK and those who want Britain's access to the single market to be more constrained, BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said.\n\nThe UK wants to maintain the status quo on internal security, which is also \"a problem,\" ambassadors were told.\n\nAnd Spain raised serious concerns about Gibraltar, which officials fear could grow in the coming days, he added.\n\nA diplomat said the message from the EU's Brexit negotiators to the member states was: \"Keep a lid on your concerns for now and we'll deal with them in the negotiations on the future relationship.\"\n\nHow close is May to a no confidence vote?\n\nSir Graham told BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics he would not reveal how many letters he had received - saying he had not even told his wife, who is his parliamentary assistant.\n\n\"I get asked in the supermarket, in the street,\" he said.\n\nSir Graham said he found the suggestion he had received 48 letters but not acted on it to be \"slightly offensive\".\n\n\"It's critical that people trust my integrity in this,\" he said.\n\nSir Graham also told the BBC's Sunday Politics North West it was \"very likely\" Mrs May would win a vote of no-confidence if there was one.\n\nWhat would a vote mean for the Brexit summit?\n\nIt is difficult to see how the 25 November EU summit could go ahead if Mrs May were to lose a confidence vote next week.\n\nIt is up to Sir Graham to decide when such a vote would be held, but he has said the process will move quickly.\n\nThe last time a Tory leader was ousted by their own MPs, in 2003, Iain Duncan Smith faced a confidence vote the next day.\n\nIf Mrs May were to lose that confidence vote it would spark a leadership election but she would not be allowed to run. She would remain prime minister until the contest was over unless she opted to resign and hand over to a caretaker prime minister.\n\nIn either circumstance, her version of Brexit would be in doubt.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk has said the summit will go ahead unless something \"extraordinary\" happens - he did not elaborate on what that might be.\n\nWhy did Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab resign?\n\nMr Raab, who negotiated with the EU's Michel Barnier, explained his decision to quit on the BBC's Andrew Marr show.\n\nWith \"two or three points\" being changed he could support the government's proposals, he said.\n\nHe said he did not know who had inserted a clause on customs relations into the future partnership document but said it was a \"clear breach\" of the Conservative manifesto.\n\n\"The difficulty for me is that I was being asked to go over to Brussels and sign on the bottom line... on a deal which I said in good conscience I did not feel was right for the country,\" he said.\n\n\"I do think we are being bullied, I do think we are being subjected to what is pretty close to blackmail frankly.\n\n\"I do think there is a point at which, we probably should have done it before, where we just say 'I'm sorry this is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, we cannot accept those dictated terms'.\"\n\nWhy are people unhappy with the deal?\n\nThe draft document sets out the terms of the UK's departure, including details such as how much money will be paid to the EU, details of the transition period and citizens' rights.\n\nBoth the UK and the EU want to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border so they agreed to include in the deal a \"backstop\" - or back-up plan - in case they cannot reach a long-term trade agreement which does this.\n\nThis would mean Northern Ireland would stay more closely aligned to some EU rules, which critics say is unacceptable.\n\nAnd the UK would not be able to leave the backstop without the EU's consent.\n\nWriting in the Sunday Telegraph, the Brexiteer MP Zac Goldsmith said under the PM's plan \"in effect, Britain would remain in the EU, but without having any say\".\n\nHe added: \"Had that been the choice, I personally would have voted to remain.\"\n\nWhat would Labour do?\n\nLabour leader Mr Corbyn says his party, which has 257 MPs, will not support the deal.\n\nHe told Sky News the \"one-way agreement\" on Northern Ireland was \"not acceptable\", and there were no guarantees on workers' rights and environmental protections.\n\nIf it was voted down in the Commons, he said the government should go back to the EU and \"renegotiate, rapidly\".\n\nMr Corbyn insisted Labour would be able to negotiate a better deal, saying the proposed transition period - which will only happen if there is a withdrawal agreement - offered \"some opportunities\" for this.\n\nHe also said another referendum - as demanded by some of his MPs - was \"an option for the future but not an option for today\".\n\nHe said he voted Remain in the 2016 referendum but if there were to be another \"I don't know how I would vote - what the options would be at that time\".\n\nHe also revealed that he had not yet read all of the 585 page draft EU withdrawal agreement."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "The women smashing Ethiopia's glass ceiling", "description": "Male dominance in Ethiopia is being challenged with the appointment of women to powerful government posts, writes Hana Zeratsyon.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-46110608", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/825C/production/_104127333_gettyimages-551004747.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T01:45:51Z", "content": "Image copyright ullstein bild Image caption Chief Justice Meaza Ashenafi's work as a lawyer led to a Hollywood film Ethiopia is changing rapidly under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, with women now wielding enormous power in a country where they have mostly been c\u2026 [+8010 chars]", "fulltext": "Image copyright ullstein bild Image caption Chief Justice Meaza Ashenafi's work as a lawyer led to a Hollywood film\n\nEthiopia is changing rapidly under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, with women now wielding enormous power in a country where they have mostly been confined to traditional roles, writes BBC Tigrinya's Hana Zeratsyon.\n\nEthiopians like to say they were ruled by Queen Sheba in biblical times - something they take great pride in, yet the reality is that the Horn of Africa state is a deeply male-dominated society.\n\nAs gender and law consultant Hilina Birhanu puts it: \"Patriarchy is our society's mother tongue. We learn from early to look down on women.\"\n\nThis is borne out by some of the often-heard proverbs in languages spoken by Ethiopians, including \"a house built by a woman does not have a base\", \"a woman's country is her husband and her livelihood is her character\" and \"as a soul is in its creator, a woman is in her master\".\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Will this Ethiopian girl be able to do things her mother and grandmother couldn't?\n\nWomen, who make up about half the population of 102.5 million, are largely confined to traditional roles, especially in rural areas where they spend much of their time at home, looking after their children, fetching wood and water from rivers, and weeding and transporting cereals.\n\nStatistics compiled by the Ethiopian government and other bodies show that:\n\nNearly 25% of women leave most decisions to their husbands\n\nAlmost 50% have experienced violence from a partner\n\nLess than 20% of girls enrol for secondary education\n\nMore than 40% are married before they turn 18\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's decision to promote women to powerful posts has been widely welcomed, with rights groups hoping that the new government will follow it up by unveiling major initiatives in the coming months to improve the lives of ordinary women.\n\nMr Abiy, 42, has given half of the government's 20 ministerial posts to women. This is in contrast to the four posts women held in the much larger cabinet of his predecessor, Hailemariam Dessalegn.\n\nEthiopia and Rwanda are now the only African states to have equal gender representation in the cabinet.\n\nMr Abiy has also appointed renowned human rights lawyer Meaza Ashenafi - whose efforts to tackle the underage marriage of girls formed the basis of an Angelina Jolie-produced Hollywood film in 2014 - as the country's most senior judge.\n\nIn two other moves, communications expert Billene Aster Seyoum has been appointed as the prime minister's press secretary, while former UN official Sahle-Work Zewde was elected by the male-dominated parliament as president.\n\nTribute to mother\n\nAlthough Ms Sahle-Work's post is largely ceremonial, she represents Ethiopia at some international events, boosting the profile of women and highlighting the need to increase female representation in other African governments. She is currently Africa's only female head of state.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Sahle-Work Zewde is the ceremonial head of state, while Abiy Ahmed (r) holds the political power\n\nRediet Kefale - a member of the Yellow movement, which campaigns for the rights of women - told the BBC: \"We have never seen women in power like this. It is new to our eyes. Whatever the post, it is a great move to develop women's leadership.\"\n\nThe first hint that Mr Abiy intended to champion women's rights came in his inaugural address as prime minister in April, when he took the unprecedented step of paying tribute to his late mother in parliament.\n\n\"My mother is counted among the many kind, innocent, and hardworking Ethiopian mothers... Though she is not alive, I would love to thank her,\" he said.\n\n\"Furthermore, I would love to thank my wife who took my mother's vision to help me and substituted my mother,\" he added, as the male-majority parliament broke into rapturous applause.\n\nMinister of peace\n\nFurthermore, the nation's - and the prime minister's - security has been placed in the hands of women for the first time, with Mr Abiy giving ex-construction minister Aisha Mohammed the defence portfolio and former parliamentary speaker Muferiat Kamil the newly created peace ministry, which covers the police and the powerful intelligence agencies.\n\nThe appointment of the two women is also historic because they are Muslims from minority ethnic groups who have never held such powerful posts before.\n\nTheir presence in the cabinet, therefore, helps Mr Abiy - who comes from Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, the Oromo, and was born to a Muslim father and a Christian mother - achieve not only gender parity, but to widen his support base among ethnic minorities and Muslims, who sometimes complain of political marginalisation.\n\n'Less corrupt than men'\n\nAlthough they do not have a background in the military or police, both women are known to be political heavyweights, with Ms Aisha probably having more clout as she heads one of the four parties which form the ruling coalition, the Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF).\n\nExplaining the appointments when he made them last month, Mr Abiy said women were \"less corrupt than men\" and would help achieve peace - a key challenge for a nation where hundreds of people have lost their lives in ethnic and political violence since 2015.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Ethnic Oromos were at the forefront of protests under the former prime minister\n\nAnd his reasoning appeared to have become clearer last week when more than 60 officials - including the former head of a military-run business conglomerate and the former deputy head of the national intelligence agency - were arrested amid an investigation into corruption and human rights abuses.\n\nAbeba Gebressilase, who unsuccessfully ran for parliament as an independent in the 2005 election, said she had no doubt that Mr Abiy's decision to give women greater power would pay off.\n\n\"Women are always peace-loving and when something that destroys peace happens, it is the mothers who pay,'' she told the BBC.\n\n'No favours to women'\n\nAn academic at Ethiopia's Mekelle University, Mekonen Fiseha, said that while he agreed with this view, it was still to be seen whether the female ministers would stand up to Mr Abiy if they had to.\n\n''If the prime minister made the appointments to avoid the challenges he will face from men and to create a 'yes mentality' via women, this will not solve the country's problems,'' he warned.\n\nBut Ms Hilina - the gender and law consultant - dismissed such concerns, saying: ''I do not think these women came to power because of Abiy's, society's or the system's generosity. Rather, it is the result of their hard work and endeavour. So, as women, we should not see this as a favour.\"\n\nRead more about Ethiopia's transformation:\n\nMs Meaza - the newly appointed head of the federal Supreme Court - is probably the best example of this.\n\nThe founder of the Ethiopian Women Lawyers' Association, she is widely recognised for challenging discriminatory laws and putting women's issues on the national agenda.\n\nTrue story behind Angelina Jolie film\n\nHer biggest success came in the late 1990s when she defended a 14-year-old child bride in court. The girl was accused of killing her \"husband\" who had abducted and raped her.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Difret was shown in Hollywood\n\nShe won the case, and it led to Ethiopia outlawing the traditional practice of abducting young girls for marriage. The precedent-setting case gained international attention, and formed the basis of the film Difret (Amharic for courage), which had Angelina Jolie as its executive producer.\n\nFollowing her appointment, Ms Meaza said: \"I am so happy that the glass ceiling is shattered and my daughters can dream of becoming anyone they want to be in Ethiopia.\n\n\"I will strive to deliver justice for all. The less empowered people will benefit, especially women,\" she added.\n\nBut a reminder of the scale of the challenges she and the other trailblazing women face came when some men in Ethiopia responded to her appointment by saying \"wendata'', in the widely spoken Amharic language.\n\nThis is loosely translated as \"manly\", and is often used to congratulate a woman on her success.\n\nIn other words, she's so good, she's like a man."}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "When Kindertransport arrived in Llanwrtyd Wells", "description": "Llanwrtyd Wells took in 120 war-time child refugees who arrived on Kindertransport in 1943.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46230748", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A1AA/production/_104368314_b.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T01:45:00Z", "content": "Image copyright Fred Morley/Fox Photos/Getty Images Image caption 2 December 1938: Child refugees arriving at Harwich, Essex, from Germany It is said to be the smallest town in Britain, but some might argue it has the biggest heart.

The tiny toxic particles, known as PM2.5, can get deep into the lungs and into the bloodstream.\n\nIndia's Supreme Court also recently took notice of the rickshaw pullers' plight.

You cannot tell them that you stop your work because it is unsafe for you to work in the morning.

Ours is a clean way of transportation. But it's ironic that we are the worst affected from the toxic smog,\" he says.\n\nHe wants the government to help rickshaw pullers.\n\n\"At the very least they can give us temporary shelter. We are dying a slow death and it's not even our fault. Nobody cares about us, as if we don't even exist,\" he says.\n\nHis frustration is understandable. The state and federal governments both routinely come up with \"stay indoors\" during the smog season.\n\nBut unfortunately this is not an option for Delhi's rickshaw pullers, who have to just pedal on.\n\n\"I guess hunger is a bigger problem than pollution for us. And that's why nobody cares. But we have to continue working no matter what,\" Himasuddin adds before disappearing into the thick smog.\n\nPictures by Ankit Srinivas"}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "No escape", "description": "The James Watt Street blaze was the most deadly in Glasgow since World War Two yet there is no memorial.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-46223686", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p06s12cr.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T01:14:30Z", "content": "Media caption There is no memorial to those who died in the James Watt Street blaze The James Watt Street blaze was the most deadly in Glasgow since World War Two - yet 50 years on there is no memorial to the 22 people who perished.

If he remains in office past 31 May 2019, he will surpass Israel's founding father David Ben-Gurion as the country's longest-serving prime minister.\n\nHe warned his colleagues on Sunday that \"we know what happens when elements in a right-wing government led to the government being toppled, like in 1992 and in 1999, which brought us the disaster of Oslo [accords with the Palestinians] and the disaster of the [Second] Intifada\".\n\nWhat led to the crisis?\n\nLast Sunday, an undercover Israeli unit was intercepted in Gaza, which is run by the Palestinian militant group Hamas.\n\nAn ensuing firefight, in which Israeli tanks and aircraft opened fire, left seven Palestinian militants and one of the Israeli commandos dead.\n\nHamas unleashed some 460 rockets and mortars at Israel over the next 48 hours - the heaviest barrage since the two sides fought a war in 2014. Israel responded with 160 air strikes, targeting militant sites in Gaza.\n\nThe violence killed seven more people in Gaza and one in Israel.\n\nOn Tuesday, Hamas and Israel agreed to cease fire after Egyptian mediation.\n\nMr Lieberman and Mr Bennett both opposed Israel's decision, seeing it as a surrender.

In Mali, Jennifer O'Mahony meets some of women trying to bring stability to the region.\n\nSuperintendent Catherine Ugorji is settling in for another 24-hour shift monitoring UN patrols in the troubled Malian city of Gao. This formidable Nigerian policewoman cracks jokes with colleagues from Burkina Faso and Tunisia in fluent French, and scans her computer screen for the evening's planned routes.\n\nAs a woman, she is a highly unusual presence on the sprawling UN base here, where the prefabricated buildings, mess hall and football field are all full of men.\n\nIt doesn't seem to bother her much. \"I like action. Whatever they say a man does, I like doing it,\" she says.\n\nShe is one of just 477 female police and military working for Mali's 15,000-strong peacekeeping mission, and the UN would like to recruit more.\n\nBut the job is a difficult sell.\n\nThe Mali mission has the grim distinction of being the deadliest active peacekeeping deployment in the world, with 106 blue helmets murdered so far by hostile forces and dozens more killed by accidents and illness.\n\nUgorji is used to working in challenging environments, however. She cut her teeth as a beat cop on the mean streets of Lagos, Nigeria's largest city and a place legendary in West Africa for the inventiveness of its criminals. Her time chasing drug dealers and scammers around Lagos makes her work as a peacekeeper in this jihadist enclave seem \"very easy\", she beams.\n\nImage copyright Xaume Olleros\n\n\"Lagos is a very tough town. I worked as a divisional police officer and crime officer,\" she says. \"I would work around the clock... In the night is when all the bad people move.\"\n\nIn her time off, she catches up with her husband and three children via WhatsApp, or heads to the gym for what she says is typically a two-hour workout.\n\nThe UN deployed peacekeepers here in 2013, once French forces had driven out al-Qaeda-linked jihadists who had taken over the city. The jihadists had occupied Gao for several months and imposed a strict interpretation of Islamic law that included amputating the limbs of thieves and forcing women to cover their faces.\n\nBut the presence of the departed fighters is still keenly felt. The city was hit by a suicide attack in July, and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) have killed hundreds of civilians on country roads.\n\nImage copyright Xaume Olleros\n\nThe jihadists have actually been expanding their territory. Al-Qaeda militants in northern Mali have been joined by Islamic State in central Mali, making use of porous borders to escape into neighbouring countries, and tapping into sympathetic elements in the local population. The only way for the UN to stay ahead is through better intelligence, and this is precisely where more women could make the difference.\n\nJayci Jimenez, a US Air Force captain and intelligence adviser to the UN mission, says that in Gao, local women cannot be seen talking to men who are strangers for cultural reasons - but they might chat freely with a policewoman like Ugorji and let slip some information about unusual movements in their neighbourhood.\n\nYet despite the obvious value of women on patrol, there is still significant internal opposition to the not-very-secretly codenamed \"Operation Female Outreach\".\n\nOne Senegalese commander was hesitant to allow one of the few women serving in his unit to go on patrol, Jimenez says. \"Imagine the negative publicity if something were to happen to them outside the wire,\" he told her, especially after he himself had pushed so hard to have women recruited in the first place.\n\nImage copyright Xaume Olleros Image caption Cambodian troops wait for the arrival of the force commander at the supercamp in Gao\n\nMali's peacekeeping operation is not unusually male-dominated, either. According to UN figures, about 4% of military staff and 10% of police personnel in UN peacekeeping missions around the world are women.\n\nDeath or injury are not the only risks they face.

It was a beautiful country with remote areas that we could populate.\"\n\nIn 1977, Laura and hundreds of others uprooted their lives to re-settle at the People's Temple Agricultural Project - informally known as Jonestown after its leaders' name.\n\n\"I had no concerns about moving there.

Other survivors might say differently, but for me, I was delighted. It was not an unhappy part of my life.\"\n\nAt the end of October Laura was asked by Jones to move to Georgetown - the Guyanese capital a 24-hour boat ride away - to work at the church headquarters.\n\nShe believes her relocation was a calculated move by Jones, brought on because of growing scrutiny and an impending visit by California Congressman Leo Ryan.\n\n\"Jim Jones looked at zealots [like Laura - people who would speak positively about People's Temple] and stacked the deck in Georgetown for Congressman Ryan's visit,\" she says.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The vast majority of Jonestown's residents were African-American\n\nImage copyright Claire Janaro via Jonestown Institute Image caption More than 300 children were killed in the 18 November 1978 massacre\n\nThe politician was heading up an investigatory expedition to the compound after family members in the US expressed concern their loved ones were being held against their will.\n\nIn one high-profile case, the defector parents of a child called John Victor Stoen - who Jones claimed he had fathered - publicly battled for custody.\n\nAnd meanwhile, Laura recalls, \"Jim Jones's state of mind was deteriorating and the Jonestown experiment was beginning to fail.\n\n\"People were accusing Jim Jones of abducting their children, and his secretaries had run away with scandalous information about what was going on.\"\n\nIn May 1978 an aide close to Jones, Deborah Layton Blakey, escaped to Georgetown to seek refuge at the American embassy.\n\nShe submitted an affidavit which spoke about the \"tyrannical hold\" of the Messianic Jones who she said would broadcast ranting sermons on loudspeakers for hours at a time - consumed by conspiracy theories about the US government, defectors and concerned relatives.\n\nShe also reported that compound residents suffered food shortages and were at times plagued by illnesses like diarrhoea.\n\n\"Jonestown wasn't set up for so many people - we were 1,000 - and we were not self-sufficient.

He was less and less able to function.\"\n\nImage copyright FBI Image caption A recovered photograph shows stuffed animals being made by residents in Jonestown\n\nImage copyright FBI Image caption An FBI image taken after the massacre shows the scale of the Jonestown site\n\nSurvivors recalled \"white night\" events, sometimes weekly, where Jones would declare a crisis about the compound's safety.\n\nSometimes these involved mock mass-suicides where followers, including children, lined up and drank liquid they were told was laced with poison, only to be told it was a test of loyalty.\n\nWhen Congressman Ryan visited with a delegation in November, he brought along concerned relatives of Temple members and journalists to document the trip.\n\nAfter initial resistance, the group were permitted access and given tours which presented a largely pleasant depiction of everyday life.\n\nCharles Krause, a Washington Post reporter on the trip, would recall: \"Contrary to what the 'Concerned Relatives' had told us, nobody seemed to be starving... everyone seemed quite healthy.\"\n\nThe group stayed outside of the compound overnight and returned the next day. During their time there, the group were approached by at least a dozen followers asking to return to the US with them.\n\nAs the delegation waited for their returning flight, a cohort of Temple gunmen ambushed the group and opened fire, killing five people including Congressman Ryan.\n\nBack at the compound, Jones simultaneously urged his more than 900 followers to take their own lives, warning that the Guyanese military would invade and take their children because of the airstrip shooting.\n\nVats of fruit punch laced with cyanide were mixed and distributed around, as in the rehearsals.\n\n\"Jim Jones was a con artist - he made everyone feel he was their father,\" Laura says of the leader.\n\n\"He would say to them: 'you can't go back, you have no money', which was true. They had put it all in the church.\"\n\nImage copyright FBI Image caption Three journalists and a defector were also killed in the ambush at Port Kaituma airstrip\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The group were pressured into committing \"revolutionary suicide\" with cyanide-laced Flavor Aid drink\n\n\"They feared repercussions of the death of the congressman,\" she says. \"He lied to them every day - he fed them paranoia. They had no recourse.\"\n\n'Everybody is dead'\n\nBack at the Guyana headquarters 150 miles (240km) away, members were alerted to the order.\n\n\"Jim Jones's secretary, Sharon Amos, received a message on the radio sent to Georgetown, San Francisco and Redwood Valley,\" Laura recalls.\n\n\"It said: 'Everybody in Jonestown is dying or dead. Everybody else needs to commit revolutionary suicide right now. We are all doing it right now.'\"\n\nLaura says two of Jones' children, who were visiting the capital as part of the Temple's basketball team, refused to follow instructions and told other branches to disregard them.\n\nShe had been out of the building when the message arrived, and returned to find Guyanese national defence forces bringing out the body-bags for the secretary and her children.\n\n\"It's hard to know what would have happened if I and the others in Georgetown had received those instructions,\" she says. \"We had options there - you could walk down the street and see people, get in a car, or get in an embassy.\"\n\n\"I think if I were in Jonestown and I saw 900 people who I loved make a choice, I can't imagine wanting to survive that.\"\n\nLaura says back at the headquarters, they began to hear reports about the death toll at Jonestown: first saying 300 dead, then 600.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption It took days for authorities to fully realise the scale of the true death toll\n\n\"We were just all devastated. We were crying, like I still cry now. I was a mess. Many of us were inconsolable,\" she says.\n\n\"Some people went out to try to identify some of the people.\n\n\"Their bodies were left out in the open, in the middle of the rainforest, in a foreign country. Every possible thing that could be botched, was botched. There is no real way to know exactly who died how. It was just horrific.\"\n\nThe final death toll, including the airstrip killings and Jones himself, totalled 918 people.\n\nKrause, who survived the ambush and was the first journalist allowed on the scene of the massacre, said that even dogs and the Jonestown pet chimpanzee died alongside the residents.\n\n\"I realized that Jones had meant to leave nothing, not even the animals, to bear witness to the final horror. There were to be no survivors,\" he wrote in the Washington Post shortly after.\n\nBefore the events of 11 September 2001, Jonestown was the largest single incident of intentional civilian death in American history.\n\nLaura returned to the US at the end of November 1978 and moved back into the People's Temple community in California - a decision that she says she had no qualms about.\n\n\"They were my family. I had lived with them for eight years, I knew them so intimately,\" she says. \"I never had any fears. Jim Jones was the only one who was invested in the deaths.\"\n\n\"We had gone through this collective trauma together. And it made sense to go through the healing together.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Piles of victims' passports photographed after the massacre\n\nImage copyright FBI Image caption Reels of audio broadcast by Jones were seized in the aftermath\n\n\"My mother and sister could not understand how I had gotten into the Temple, how I stayed over there... they couldn't get it. They couldn't grasp the loss.\"\n\nAfter a year back at the People's Temple, Laura joined another community where she met her husband and lived for a decade where they had a son together.\n\n\"Then I said, 'I'm done, I want to be an adult now'. I went back to school, and I started teaching in 1995,\" Laura says.\n\n'No closure'\n\nHaving avoided talking about the traumatic experience for almost two decades, Laura eventually met up with Temple survivors for the first time in 1998.\n\n\"There had been no forum to have negative discussions until then,\" she says. \"Twenty years later, we could finally sit down in a circle and have a conversation about what happened.\"\n\nThe trauma of working out the minority who had lived became traumatising and overwhelming, so on meet-ups she found herself surprised to encounter people she did not know had made it out.\n\nThe anniversary - 18 November - has become a day for her and others to honour the more than 900 lives that were lost.\n\nImage copyright Laura Johnson Kohl Image caption Laura (left) photographed with fellow-survivor Claire Janaro\n\n\"Meeting these other people for these anniversaries has helped me rebuild my life - the reality is that I am not just Laura Kohl, I am the Laura Kohl who went to People's Temple, who survived People's Temple and who continues to kick ass,\" she says.\n\n\"It's so much a part of me.

Both the summer and winter versions of the Olympic Games are multi-billion dollar spectacle\u2026 [+8765 chars]", "fulltext": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Demonstrators protest against Chicago's bid to host the 2016 Olympics\n\nIt has long been billed as the greatest show on Earth.\n\nBoth the summer and winter versions of the Olympic Games are multi-billion dollar spectacles that bring together the world's top athletes and draw masses of media coverage.\n\nSo when residents in the Canadian city of Calgary voted on whether to bid to host the 2026 Winter Olympics last week, you might have expected an enthusiastic thumbs-up.\n\nBut instead their verdict was clear: thanks, but no thanks.\n\nTheir rejection, motivated by fears about high costs and questions about the economic benefits, came after three other cities all withdrew from bidding earlier this year.\n\nThis is part of a bigger problem that experts say could threaten the very future of the Olympic Games: fewer and fewer cities around the world want to play host.\n\nJust consider the numbers: the 2004 Summer Games, which were ultimately held in Athens, attracted 11 bids but the 2024 event garnered just two.\n\nSo what's behind this trend? Chris Dempsey knows more than most about why there is increasing scepticism.\n\nHe spearheaded the opposition to Boston's bid for the 2024 Olympics, a movement that started in his living room in early 2013 after a conversation with some friends.\n\n\"We saw that a group of very wealthy and powerful [people] had gotten together and decided that a bid would be a good thing for Boston,\" he says. \"But we were concerned about the cost.\"\n\n\"At first, the polling showed that Bostonians were very open to hosting the Olympics,\" he explains. \"But when they started reading the fine print - that's when they decided that the bid wasn't in their best interests.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Chris Dempsey led a grassroots campaign to oppose the Boston bid for the 2024 Olympics\n\nHe says the financial burden of hosting the Games was the primary concern, along with a resentment of outsiders telling the city what would be best for it.\n\n\"[We] wanted to be heard and to chart the future of our city. I think in Calgary they felt the same way,\" he says.\n\nAnd he appears to have a point.\n\nAfter Calgary residents voted overwhelmingly against running as hosts last week, one Calgary councillor, Sean Chu, said: \"I think that people had enough of the establishment, telling us what to do, what to think. They tell you to spend millions, billions, it's good for you.\"\n\nAfter polls began to show declining support for Boston's bid, it was withdrawn in the summer of 2015 in what was seen as an unlikely victory for the 'No' camp.\n\n\"The 'Yes' side spent about $15 million (\u00a311.7m) and we spent less than $10,000 on our entire campaign,\" Mr Dempsey says.\n\nHe believes that residents should assess the facts of an Olympic bid rather than just buying into the pride and honour of being a host.\n\n\"When democracies look at this as a public policy question - and they soberly assess the pros and cons - their voters are realising that this is just not in their best interests,\" he says.\n\n\"We were always confident that we had the facts on our side.\"\n\nGrowing concerns over the economic benefits of hosting an Olympics are not unreasonable, experts say.\n\n\"There is good reason for cities to be concerned,\" says Professor Bent Flyvbjerg, who has studied decades of Olympic budgets. \"The general trend is that costs have been going up and governments are anxious about spending too much money.\n\n\"It's a multi-billion dollar budget that you will need to host the Games and that's only covering the direct sports-related costs,\" he says. \"There are also the indirect infrastructure costs such as improving transport systems.\"\n\nThe cost of the 2014 Winter Games in Russia's Sochi was put at $51bn - the most expensive in history. The Beijing Summer Olympics in 2008 cost $40bn.\n\nProf Flyvbjerg says that every Olympic Games since 1960 has run over its budget - some by startling amounts.\n\nImage copyright BBC Sport\n\nSo why is spending increasing? \"People like to put on bigger parties,\" he says. \"There's a sort of competition that everyone wants to do the best Olympics ever.\"\n\nThe other reason for this is inexperience, Prof Flyvbjerg suggests.\n\n\"Any city that puts on the Olympics has never done it before or did it so long ago they cannot use that experience,\" he says. \"So you have inexperienced people in charge of putting on a multi-billion dollar event which is bound to lead to cost overrun.\n\n\"It's not sustainable. I think it's come as a bit of a shock for the International Olympic Committee [IOC].\"\n\nThe IOC, which organises the event, does recognise the worry around costs.\n\n\"We know the cost of the Games is a concern,\" its Olympic Games Executive Director Christophe Dubi tells the BBC. \"I feel that we have to make all efforts to contain the costs and complexity.\"\n\nHe says that a number of measures have been introduced in recent years that are aimed at reducing the cost of hosting the Games.\n\nThe organisation has started pledging money to offset some of the financial burden. It has promised to contribute $1.8bn to the organising committee of the 2028 Games in Los Angeles, for example.\n\nIt also wants to see bids from cities that already have the right infrastructure and venues in place. This is due to growing concerns about so-called \"white elephants\", expensive facilities that go to waste after the Games have finished.\n\nTake this year's Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang in South Korea. The centrepiece of that event was a brand new $109m stadium that was used a grand total of four times.\n\nIn Brazil, many of the expensive arenas that were used in the 2016 Olympics have been left abandoned, creating environmental hazards.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Before and after: The Aquatics stadium was left abandoned after the 2016 Games in Rio\n\n\"Generally speaking if a city doesn't have a stadium or arena before the Olympics come, then why would they need one afterwards?\" asks Professor Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist who was also part of the No Boston Olympics campaign.\n\n\"The reason why the stadium or arena didn't exist before the Olympics happened is because there wasn't an economically viable reason... to make the investment,\" he says.\n\n\"It ends up being financially and environmentally very wasteful.\"\n\nAll of this contributes to a view that the Games are excessive and extravagant. This is something the IOC says it is trying to combat, and Prof Zimbalist suggests that seeking bids from cities with pre-existing arenas is the right approach going forward.\n\n\"Some cities like Los Angeles can get away with hosting the Summer Games with almost no investment so then it can make sense,\" he says.\n\nSo why would a city without the right infrastructure bid at all?\n\nDaniel Ritterband, who worked in marketing for the London 2012 Olympics and on the Budapest bid for 2024, argues that the Games can actually have a positive impact on less-developed cities.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Fireworks go off over the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium\n\n\"I think the future is for small cities of a million people where the Games can really have a transformative effect,\" he says. \"Some of the things that are disruptive in bigger cities - like specialist traffic lanes - are less disruptive in smaller ones.\"\n\nHe says that having public support is \"essential\". \"If you don't take them with you then you're doomed - that's what happened in Boston,\" he says.\n\nSo what would his advice be to a city considering a bid in future?\n\n\"It needs to be part of a 20 year plan of how to move the economy onwards where you build up the infrastructure and support then it's totally worthwhile.\n\n\"There has to be a clear benefit to the people in terms of jobs and skills,\" he adds. \"Whether that's hospitality programmes or the increase in short-term contracts.\n\n\"It's the greatest moment of national pride a country can have. How people were talking about it in 2012 showed that the nation had their chests puffed out.\"\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption A Londoner celebrates as the announcement is made that London will host the 2012 Games\n\nBut the reality is that bids from smaller cities, however beneficial an Olympics may be, are not being made. So if the worst-case scenario for the IOC comes and the bids dry up, what can they do?\n\n\"The rational end is to have one city that's the permanent host of the summer Games and one that is the permanent host of the winter Games,\" Prof Zimbalist says.\n\nMr Dempsey says \"this could make a lot of sense\", but there would still be questions about who would take up the site indefinitely.\n\n\"The problem is that these cities don't really show an interest in taking them now,\" says Professor Donald Dengel, who has researched the long-term impact of the Olympics on a host city.\n\n\"So the IOC would have to contribute... to the upkeep and maintenance of the facilities so the citizens don't have to take up that burden.\"\n\n\"They're going to have to make the financial incentives much greater,\" he says. \"It's a really tough call for them.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "'Stolen friend': Rapa Nui seek return of moai statue", "description": "The huge basalt statue, displayed in the British Museum, was taken from Easter Island 150 years ago.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-46222276", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10275/production/_104356166_alamy.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T00:24:28Z", "content": "Image copyright Alamy Image caption Hoa Hakananai'a was removed from Rapa Nui in the 19th Century Prominent among the eclectic hoard of treasures in London's British Museum is the imposing figure of Hoa Hakananai'a, a four-tonne basalt statue from the Chilean\u2026 [+5166 chars]", "fulltext": "Image copyright Alamy Image caption Hoa Hakananai'a was removed from Rapa Nui in the 19th Century\n\nProminent among the eclectic hoard of treasures in London's British Museum is the imposing figure of Hoa Hakananai'a, a four-tonne basalt statue from the Chilean Pacific territory of Rapa Nui - named Easter Island by European explorers.\n\nThe statues, known as moai, were carved by the island's indigenous Rapa Nui people to embody the spirit of a prominent ancestor, with each considered to be the person's living incarnation.\n\nImage copyright Chilean Ministry of National Assets Image caption The moai are one of the main attractions for visitors but to locals they have spiritual significance\n\n\"The British taking the moai from our island is like me going into your house and taking your grandfather to display in my living room,\" says Anakena Manutomatoma, who is a native of the island and serves on Rapa Nui's development commission.\n\n\"For us, the repatriation of Hoa Hakananai'a is an absolute priority.\"\n\nLong way from home\n\nThe statue, along with a second, smaller moai known as Hava, were given as gifts to Queen Victoria in 1869 by the captain of HMS Topaze, Commodore Richard Powell.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nHis crew excavated Hoa Hakananai'a from a cliff top near the Rano Kau crater in November 1868, and the Queen donated the two statues to the British Museum.\n\nIt has been on display 8,500 miles (13,700km) from its spiritual home ever since.\n\nAlongside its clear cultural and spiritual importance, Hoa Hakananai'a is a particularly fine example of the statues that see thousands of tourists visit Rapa Nui each year.\n\n\"In some ways the statue is unique because it is made from a very hard basalt lava rock, unlike the majority of statues on Rapa Nui.

Then in the late 2000s he realised that the technology was good enough for him to take his work on the road.\n\nHe fell in love with RVs during a series of holidays to the US with a girlfriend, then bought his first vehicle at the Tampa RV Supershow in 2009.\n\nWorking from a trailer is not without its perils though.\n\nHe recalls one time at a campsite in Sparta, north Carolina, when he was all set up to have a meeting with a client in Solihull.\n\n\"Everything was going swimmingly, then suddenly all went black. The client and the girls in the office had no idea what was going on.\"\n\nA tornado had ripped through the campground, taking out the electricity and wi-fi.\n\n\"So I jumped into my truck and drove to the closest town,\" he says, went to a hotel chain where he's a privileged member and used its conference facilities. \"We rescued it.\"\n\nImage copyright Leo Millward Image caption Millward's office back in the UK.

Firms are also pursuing mergers, saying size will help them compete.\n\nDisney embodies both trends.\n\nThe firm's $71bn takeover of Fox's entertainment business is its biggest purchase yet, following the acquisition of Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm.\n\nAnd while the deal initially raised fears of cuts at Fox's studios, Mr Iger told financial analysts recently that the firm will increase investment to develop content for its three streaming services: Hulu, known for its general audience TV shows; ESPN+, its new US sports app; and Disney+, a family-focused service set to begin in the US in 2019.\n\nOf course, Netflix isn't sitting still. The firm has its own relationship with Viacom, including a new multi-picture deal with subsidiary Paramount Pictures.\n\nWhat do the numbers say?\n\nNetflix remains the clear market leader, with more than 137 million global subscribers.\n\nBy the end of the year, the firm is expected to have more than 147 million viewers in the US alone, according to eMarketer, which defines viewers more broadly than subscribers to account for practices such as sharing passwords.\n\nThe firm places Amazon second with 88.7 million viewers, followed by Hulu with 55 million.\n\nBut with many households expected to hold multiple subscriptions and online video watching on the rise, newcomers can still make gains.\n\nAnalysts at MoffettNathanson estimate that Disney+ could attract about 2.4 million members in the US by the end of its first year.\n\nWhat about the rest of the world?\n\nThough its services will launch in the US, Disney plans to eventually expand Disney+ and Hulu internationally, starting in Europe.\n\nAnd analysts say the firm is in a strong position globally.\n\nThat's thanks to its brand recognition and the Fox purchase, which will make it an instant force in key markets, such as India, where Fox's Star India owns the country's leading streaming service.\n\nFor now, it's not clear if Disney intends its online video offerings as standalone products pitched at niche groups, such as sports fans and families, or if the firm will aim for a more mass-market audience, says Dan Cryan, executive director media of technology and telecoms at IHS Markit.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Netflix and Amazon are investing in online video in India, where Disney is also set to become a major player\n\nWhat it decides will determine whether its entry threatens Netflix's lead, he says.\n\n\"They've got a really solid position to take it in whatever direction they need to take it to be successful,\" Mr Cryan says.\n\n\"But if it's only aiming for a subset of the market, it's not really playing the same game.\""}, {"source": {"id": "bbc-news", "name": "BBC News"}, "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Palm oil: One woman's fight to save 'the last place on Earth'", "description": "Farwiza Farhan on efforts to protect the forests where orangutan, rhinos, elephants and tigers co-exist.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46227763", "urlToImage": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ED0D/production/_104358606_wfn_farhan_farwiza_indonesia_headshot.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T00:05:18Z", "content": "Image copyright WFN Image caption Farwiza Farhan: Fighting to save Sumatra's biodiversity There is only one place in the world where orangutan, rhinos, elephants and tigers still co-exist in the wild.

It's very difficult to narrow it down to say, 'Don't buy palm oil, or only buy sustainable ones' or 'boycott everything altogether'. The way we see palm oil - it's just a crop that is so profitable, and the problem is how the demand has driven the expansion.\n\nPalm oil: pros and cons?\n\n\"The main problem with palm oil is its governance - how consumers in the developed world could push for a true conflict-free palm oil in their mode of consumption. Because we often look for short cuts. We want a sustainable product, but we are not willing to pay for it.\n\nOn what consumers can do\u2026\n\n\"We live in the age of information overload.
