More than 5,500 fire personnel were battling the blaze that covered 228 square miles (590 square kilometers) and was about 50 percent contained, officials said.\n\nFor Trump, it was a day to comfort a state grieving from twin tragedies, wildfires in both Northern and Southern California as well as a mass shooting at a popular college bar north of Los Angeles.\n\nWearing a camouflage \"USA\" hat, Trump gazed solemnly at the devastation in Paradise.\n\nSeveral burned-out buses and cars were nearby. Trees were burned, their branches bare and twisted. Homes were totally gone; some foundations remained, as did a chimney and, in front of one house, a Mickey Mouse lawn ornament. The fire was reported to have moved through the area at 80 mph.\n\n\"It's going to work out well, but right now we want to take of the people that are so badly hurt,\" Trump said visiting what remained of the Skyway Villa Mobile Home and RV Park. He noted \"there are areas you can't even get to them yet\" and the sheer number of people unaccounted for.\n\n\"I think people have to see this really to understand it,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president later toured an operation centers, met with response commanders and praised the work of firefighters, law enforcement and representatives of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\n\"We've never seen anything like this in California,\" he said. \"It's total devastation.\"\n\nTrump took a helicopter tour en route to Chico before he toured Paradise. A full cover of haze and the smell of smoke greeted the president upon his arrival at Beale Air Force Base near Sacramento.\n\n\"They're out there fighting and they're fighting like hell,\" Trump said of the first responders.\n\nHe pledged that Washington would do its part by coming to the Golden State's aid and urged the House's Republican leader, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, a Trump ally and frequent White House visitor, to \"come to the office\" to help secure the needed funding.\n\nTrump, who left Washington early Saturday and didn't expect to return to the White House until well past midnight, planned to travel several hundred miles south to visit with victims of a recent country music bar shooting. A gunman killed a dozen people at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks on Nov. 7 before committing suicide.\n\nTrump long has struggled to convey empathy to victims of national disasters and tragedies. His first reaction to the fires came in a tweet last week that drew criticism as unnecessarily critical and tone-deaf given the devastation: \"There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests.\"\n\nNature and humans share blame for the wildfires, but fire scientists are divided as to whether forest management played a major role. Nature provides the dangerous winds that have whipped the fires, the state has been in a drought and human-caused climate change over the long haul is killing and drying the shrubs and trees that provide the fuel.\n\nHe stuck to that theme in his remarks just before departing on Saturday when he outlined what he planned to discuss with Gov. Jerry Brown and Gov-elect Gavin Newsom, both Democrats: \"We will be talking about forest management. ... The one thing is that everybody now knows that this is what we have to be doing and there's no question about it. It should have been done many years ago, but I think everybody's on the right side.\"\n\nTrump, who has long feuded with the political leaders of heavily Democratic California over issues such as immigration and voting, also has threatened to withhold federal payments to the state. After being criticized for his response, Trump has shifted gears, expressing words of encouragement to first responders and those of sympathy for hit victims.\n\nBut when he was asked by Fox News in an interview set to air Sunday whether climate change played a role in the number of serious fires, he said \"maybe it contributes a little bit. The big problem we have is management.\"\n\nBrown and Newsom welcomed the president's visit, with the governor suggesting they set aside political differences since it \"now is a time to pull together for the people of California.\"\n\nBrown, a fierce advocate of addressing climate change, did not respond to Trump's statement that he has not changed his mind on the matter but pointed to several causes and they need to deal with them.\n\n\"If you really look at the facts, from a really open point of view, there are a lot of elements to be considered,\" Brown said after Trump spoke. \"The president came, he saw and I'm looking forward over the next months and beyond to really understand this threat of fire, the whole matter of drought and all the rest of it. It's not one thing, it's a lot of things and I think that if we just open our minds and look at things we'll get more stuff done.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Jacob Pramuk", "title": "Democrats won the House \u2014 now the hard part is deciding what to do with their new power", "description": "With some exceptions, the Democratic House majority will pursue incremental rather than radical change ahead of a 2020 election in which they do not want to alienate moderate voters who helped them to win the House.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/17/house-democrats-prepare-for-majority-after-midterm-election-wins.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/11/16/105578945-1542377121820gettyimages-1067494580.1910x1000.jpeg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T22:02:00Z", "content": "They also appear set to launch various investigations into the president and his Cabinet.

A new study published this week in the Astronomical Journal, coauthored by scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, uncovered new information that suggested there was a limit to how big Oumuamua actually is, and gave astronomers a better indication of its size.\n\nScientists have been looking for signs of extraterrestrial life for decades. So does the appearance of Oumuamua mean the elusive \"E.T\" has finally been detected? Perhaps: Experts say it is exceedingly unlikely, but the possibility can't be ruled out just yet.\n\n\"I personally think the odds are much better that is something natural, but I don't want to dismiss the possibility that it could be from an alien civilization. But we have to have an open mind,\" Michael Wall, a writer at Space.com and a biologist, told CNBC recently.\n\nScientists believe Oumuamua is shaped like a cigar, approximately 400 feet long and 40 feet wide. However, they are only able to guess based on its changing brightness as it spins.\n\nBut scientists' biggest unanswered question is the object's thickness. As far as the scientific community is aware, there is no naturally occurring object that is as big as Oumuamua that appears so thin at the same time, increasing the likelihood that it was created by another life form.\n\nGiven the speed the object is moving, experts believe that it may be a light sail \u2014 an object that is thin enough to be pushed by the sun or another star, almost like a plastic bag in the wind, according to Matija Cuk, a research scientist at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute.\n\nSeth Shostak, a SETI research fellow, told CNBC that for that to be true, Oumuamua would have to be about a millimeter thick\u2014about as thick as 5-10 sheets of paper stacked together.\n\nAccording to Wall, scientists originally hypothesized that Oumuamua was a comet or an asteroid. However, both theories were ruled out: Unlike comets studied here on earth, this object does not have a tail, nor jets of gas that a comet would normally emit.\n\nIf Oumuamua is not a comet or an asteroid, chances of it being a light sail increase. According to SETI's Cuk, it is possible that outside our solar system, composition of space objects are different.\n\n\"Maybe in other solar systems comets could be made differently,\" Cuk said. That suggests the object could be naturally occurring, despite the fact that nothing like it has ever been seen anywhere near earth before.\n\nShostak said there are likely many objects similar to Oumuamua in the depths of space. This time, the object \"hit the bullseye\" by reaching the earth's solar system.\n\n\"This implies a number of these things are drifting through the cosmos, as ubiquitous as fire hydrants,\" Shostak said.\n\nThese objects have also likely reached our solar system in the past and gone unnoticed. Scientists are building another telescope similar to the one in Hawaii that detected Oumuamua. Once it is completed in Chile, it will be used to search for similar objects.\n\n\"Unless a miracle has occurred, these are entering our solar system all the time. This is just the first one we've found,\" Shostak said. He acknowledged the alien hypothesis was plausible, adding that Oumuamua acted more like a rock than a spaceship.\n\n\"If they really wanted to target our solar system, they'd hang around longer and probably come closer to the earth,\" he said.\n\nScientists also would have been able to detect any sort of signal the object had if it were as advanced as a cell phone, Shostak said. That does not prove anything, but decreases the likelihood that it was deliberately sent.\n\nOumuamua is now drifting further away from our solar system. The longer the distance, the harder it will be for earthlings to study it. Yet as technology increases, scientists may discover more objects similar to Oumuamua, perhaps in the next three to ten years.\n\n\"If we don't keep finding them, this will be increasingly peculiar,\" Shostak said."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Alex Sherman", "title": "How a new breed of media companies is convincing people to pay for news again", "description": "For years, digital media companies wrestled with charging for their content.

The duopoly has dominated digital advertising and both companies are only increasing in scale and market share.\n\nTheir targeting capabilities, given all of their data, is \"second to none,\" Gulati said. \"As their growth accelerates, the opportunity for new companies diminish.\"\n\nAs a result, subscription fees are hot -- a return to how most media (newspapers, magazines, cable TV) prospered for decades.\n\nThis week alone, New York Media, the owner of New York Magazine, announced its sites would be paywalled. That was soon followed by paywall announcements by Verizon's Yahoo Finance and Uzabase's Quartz. Bloomberg, Axel Springer's Business Insider, Conde Nast's Vanity Fair and Wired, and a bunch of other online magazines introduced or hardened their paywalls this year. The New York Times, Wall Street Journal (owned by News Corp), The Financial Times (owned by Nikkei) and The Washington Post (owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos) made that decision even earlier.\n\n\"For many years, the popular narrative has been that readers simply weren't willing to pay for content online,\" said Eric Stromberg, a venture capitalist at Bedrock Capital.\n\n\"The only way to win was to build an engine of free articles that were monetized through ads and shared on social networks. Paywalls wouldn't scale. You were destined to have a niche audience if you had a paywall. We're starting to see a shift. I expect we'll see it more powerfully over the next few years.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Jillian D'Onfro", "title": "Google Pixel phones can now take amazing pictures in the dark \u2014 here's a look", "description": "Google just launched the new Night Sight feature for its Pixel smartphones and it works almost unbelievably well.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/17/google-pixel-3-night-sight-test-examples.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/11/16/105580074-1542414281459cheers2.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T17:54:00Z", "content": "Taking pictures on your smartphone in the dark is usually a lousy experience. div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child\"&gt; The photos often come out dull, discolored, or blurry, unless you use a flash, in which case you're stuck with an artificial shininess and\u2026 [+1171 chars]", "fulltext": "Taking pictures on your smartphone in the dark is usually a lousy experience.\n\nThe photos often come out dull, discolored, or blurry, unless you use a flash, in which case you're stuck with an artificial shininess and red eyes.

The prosecutor's announcement sought to quiet the global outcry over Khashoggi's death and distance the killers and their operation from the kingdom's leadership, primarily the crown prince.\n\nTrump has called the killing a botched operation that was carried out very poorly and has said \"the cover-up was one of the worst cover-ups in the history of cover-ups.\"\n\nBut he has resisted calls to cut off arms sales to the kingdom and has been reluctant to antagonize the Saudi rulers.

The newspaper said the prince's brother, who is the current Saudi ambassador to the United States, told Khashoggi he would be safe in going to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to retrieve the documents he needed to get married.\n\nThe newspaper said it was not known whether the ambassador knew Khashoggi would be killed. But it said he made the call at the direction the crown prince, and the call was intercepted by U.S. intelligence.\n\nFatimah Baeshen, a spokeswoman for the Saudi Embassy in Washington, said that claim was false.\n\nShe said in a statement issued to The Associated Press that the ambassador met Khashoggi in person once in late September 2017. After that, they communicated via text messages, she said. The last text message the ambassador sent to Khashoggi was on Oct. 26, 2017, she said.\n\nBaeshen said the ambassador did not discuss with Khashoggi \"anything related to going to Turkey.\"\n\n\"Ambassador Prince Khalid bin Salman has never had any phone conversations with him,\" she said.\n\n\"You are welcome to check the phone records and cell phone content to corroborate this -- in which case, you would have to request it from Turkish authorities,\" Baeshen said, adding that Saudi prosecutors have checked the phone records numerous times to no avail.\n\nThe ambassador himself tweeted: \"The last contact I had with Mr. Khashoggi was via text on Oct. 26, 2017. I never talked to him by phone and certainly never suggested he go to Turkey for any reason. I ask the U.S. government to release any information regarding this claim.\"\n\n--Reuters contributed to this article."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Donovan Russo, special to CNBC.com", "title": "Beyond Stan Lee: Big decisions for Marvel superhero stories and films in the future", "description": "With the death of Stan Lee and the Avengers' series about to end, comic book movie fans are wondering what will be the next stage in Marvel's superhero brand-building.\u00a0Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige recently said that the comic book movie studio films a\u2026", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/17/beyond-stan-lee-big-decisions-for-marvel-superhero-stories-in-future.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/11/16/105579816-1542401128318gettyimages-825764260.1910x1000.jpeg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T13:00:00Z", "content": "David Gabriel, Marvel's senior vice president of print, sales and marketing was criticized for comments he made last year regarding declining comic sales in relation to diversity. \"We saw the sales of any character that was diverse, any character that was new\u2026 [+1509 chars]", "fulltext": "Marvel's most-profitable superhero blockbuster franchise is still Avengers, and it will reach its conclusion this summer and after that is expected to be shelved, at least for some time, by Disney and Marvel Studios, leaving some big decisions to be made about the next stage in Marvel's brand identity.

Since 1988, the Almanac says, the Dow was higher Wednesday and Friday of Thanksgiving week 18 of 29 times.\n\nStrategists had been expecting the post-midterm election period to be a positive for stocks, with the market heading higher in the fourth quarter.

In our view, neither point of view is warranted.\"\n\nEmanuel said it may also be a positive that the Fed has slightly changed its tone to sound more dovish. He said that was his perception when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell spoke Thursday and indicated that positive growth overseas is important. The markets have been concerned about global growth being impacted by falling commodities prices, the higher dollar and trade friction.\n\nPositive trade developments could be a catalyst that could snap the stock market out of its funk and ignite a year-end rally, but strategists also say a negative outcome could keep the market under pressure.\n\nCFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell said \"we see the trade dispute with China as the single most concerning issue facing the market near-term.\"\n\n\"Not much may come from the [Trump-Xi] meeting, which the market may be able to absorb, but a lack of a trade deal or an escalation of the current situation without a plan for resolution by year end could result in an ugly start to 2019 for global equities as well as the U.S.,\" Bell wrote.\n\nSome strategists believe there could be some signs of progress made at the Argentina G-20, but Trump may still raise tariffs to 25 percent in January and put tariffs on more goods.\n\nEmanuel said even just signs of potential progress would be a positive. \"The president is sensitive to the stock market as a reflection of how people are judging his performance. He looks at the weakness of the several weeks with probably as much, if not more, concern than the average investor, given all the headwinds he's going to face politically, given the fact you now have a divided government,\" said Emanuel. \"If we're right, there's going to be some sort of progress you can point to. The market will rally well in advance [of the meeting.]\"\n\nBarclays economists Friday said in a note that they see more signs of a possible U.S.-China agreement, as the dialogue between the two countries has become more productive ahead of the G-20.\n\n\"The potential outline of an agreement: A smaller trade deficit and increased market access in exchange for tariff relief.
