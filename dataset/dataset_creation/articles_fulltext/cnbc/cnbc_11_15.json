Morgan, and John Inch, a Gordon Haskett analysts formerly of Deutche Bank, \"have been negative on GE for ages now, and they have been relentlessly and painfully right,\" Cramer said on \"Mad Money.\"\n\n\"They nailed this story every step of the way, even when the company itself seemed to be totally clueless \u2014 or perhaps something even worse \u2014 about its own prospects,\" he said. \"Which is why you do need to take your cue from these two gentlemen and wait until the real problems they say are solved before you get bullish. And they sure aren't there yet.\"\n\nTusa, the original bear, resumed coverage of GE on behalf of J.P. Morgan in May 2016. He gave the stock an underweight rating and wrote a 235-page memorandum questioning its earnings and cash flow forecasts.\n\nNo other analyst joined Tusa in the sell camp for about a year, during which he warned of potential dividend cuts and said bullish analysts were far too optimistic about GE's cash situation, Cramer said.\n\nIn May 2017, then-Deutsche Bank analyst John Inch got on board, adding to the negativity with a new theory: that even if GE ousted then-CEO Jeff Immelt, a new CEO would bring about new negativity because he would have to instantly lower Wall Street's expectations.\n\nInch's prediction came true when John Flannery took over in August 2017, setting off a series of increasingly negative news reports unraveling many of the positive stories Immelt had told Cramer in their February 2017 interview.\n\n\"This is when things really started to snowball for GE,\" Cramer said. \"In November of last year, Flannery held an analyst meeting where he did indeed cut the dividend and revealed some disturbing details about the core business, including the fact that GE's dividend had been larger than its industrial cash flow for years. [...] Turns out the bears were right all along.\"\n\nIn 2018, Tusa and Inch dug deeper. They flagged GE's ailing power business and underfunded pension liabilities as major concerns, and Inch predicted GE's removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nMeanwhile, GE kept proving them right. When GE pushed Flannery out and gave former Danaher CEO Larry Culp the CEO role, Tusa predicted another dividend cut and more multi-billion-dollar charges. Inch, now at Gordon Haskett, said GE could end up paying even more to fix its long-term insurance policy problems.\n\nGE's most recent quarter proved them right. Culp slashed the dividend to 1 cent and took a $22 billion goodwill impairment charge for the power business, which sent shares of GE into the single digits.\n\n\"Two weeks ago, Inch said he could potentially see the stock shrinking to $5, assuming that GE Capital doesn't ultimately become insolvent,\" Cramer said. \"Now he's talking about escalating liquidity risks. Then last week, Tusa cut his price target to $6. He thinks the real problem here is the fundamentals are deteriorating.\"\n\nSo for investors wondering if and when the industrial giant's stock will ever bottom, Cramer suggested looking to these two bearish oracles.\n\n\"The point here is that Tusa and Inch have nailed GE every step of the way, to the point where I don't think this stock will be able to rebound until these two bears sign off on its turnaround plans,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"And they sure haven't done so yet.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Tyler Clifford", "title": "Billionaire developer Stephen Ross: Housing markets are 'overbuilt' in most parts of the country", "description": "\"It could [get worse] because there is a lot of supply,\" the New York developer warns.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/15/housing-markets-are-overbuilt-across-the-countrystephen-ross.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/11/15/105577494-1542317218965gettyimages-930302018.1910x1000.jpeg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T23:27:00Z", "content": "There's an oversupply of homes in most housing markets across the country and rising interest rates are making it harder for buyers to make deals, billionaire real estate developer Stephen Ross told CNBC Thursday. div &gt; div.group &gt; p:first-child\"&gt; Th\u2026 [+2087 chars]", "fulltext": "There's an oversupply of luxury condominiums in most major cities across the country and rising interest rates are making it harder for buyers to make deals, billionaire real estate developer Stephen Ross told CNBC on Thursday.\n\n\"Today the condo markets ... are overbuilt in most areas of the country,\" Ross said.\n\nThat includes the New York City market, where Ross, founder and chairman of Related Cos., competed with President Donald Trump when Trump was a developer in his pre-White House years.\n\n\"Whenever you increase rates, you kind of reduce the affordability issues, and therefore you limit your market,\" he said in an interview with Diana Olick on \"Power Lunch.\" \"In soft markets, you want as broad a market as you possibly can.\"\n\nThe homeownership rate among millennials is lower than that of their parents and grandparents due to a number of personal and economic factors.\n\nThe rental market, on the other hand, has been \"really strong across the marketplace\" as more young people would rather rent than buy today, said Ross, who also owns the Miami Dolphins.\n\n\"I think that all goes back to the housing crisis when they saw what happened to their families, you know, in 2008, and the dislocation that that occurred,\" he added.\n\nLast week, mortgage application volume was down 22 percent year over year, and purchase volume was down 3 percent in that same period.

Now, high-profile CEOs are worried about growth slowing so drastically that it could actually hurt the economy, he said.\n\n\"There are degrees of slowdowns that, nonetheless, can cause an awful lot of havoc and cost a lot of jobs, and that's what we're on the verge of here,\" he said. \"That's what the markets are saying. That's what the CEOs are worried about offline.\"\n\nThe situation reminded Cramer of when, on the cusp of the 2008 financial crisis, his corporate sources confided in him that the Fed \"seemed to be out of touch ... with what was happening\" on Wall Street, he said. That led to his now-famous \"They know nothing!\" rant blasting the Fed for its lack of diligence.\n\n\"I was right,\" he said. \"I did my best and, at that time, I made a resolution. If I thought we would ever get back into one of these situations again, I promised myself I'd be vocal about what could go wrong, even if I knew it wouldn't be as serious as the Great Recession.\"\n\nNow, with market commentators warning about the U.S. economy being \"late\" in its cycle, meaning that another recession could be on the horizon, Cramer's getting vocal.\n\nWeakness in Europe and Asia's economies isn't helping, he said, pegging the respective slowdowns to Brexit pressures and instability in the Italian government and China undergoing a mass slowdown tied to President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nIf the Fed and Trump stay the course on their policies, the weakness will feed into the stock market as it did on Thursday, the \"Mad Money\" host warned. The action in shares of Walmart, Home Depot and Macy's told the story, he said: all three companies recently reported strong quarters, but subsequently saw their stocks plummet on economic fears.\n\n\"This end-of-cycle logic raises its head everywhere,\" Cramer said. \"Everything was good, so good that it can't ever be better because we're at the end of the cycle. 'Late-cycle.' It's become almost circular reasoning. The stock can't go higher because it's the end of the cycle and it's the end of the cycle because the stock's down.\"\n\nThat, combined with the chief executives' warnings, told Cramer that stocks can't possibly be safe while the bearish narrative about debilitating economic weakness reigns supreme.\n\n\"If the Fed changes course and says 'No more rate hikes ... next year unless the data gets more positive,' or if President Trump gets a trade deal with China or even does this kind of truce, then the end-of-cycle proponents may have to change their tune and the market can rocket higher,\" he said. \"Otherwise, though, rallies like today are going to be used to re-position portfolios because the bears have the late-cycle microphone and they just will not let go.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Elizabeth Gurdus", "title": "Fed's Powell still has a chance to save the economy before it's too late, Cramer says", "description": "Jim Cramer says the chairman of the Federal Reserve is at a critical juncture that will determine the trajectory of the U.S. economy in 2019.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/15/cramer-powell-still-has-a-chance-to-save-economy-before-its-too-late.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/07/17/105335325-1531847053243gettyimages-1000632248.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T23:18:00Z", "content": "With a month left until the Federal Reserve's next widely expected interest rate hike, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is facing a critical juncture that could determine the trajectory of the U.S. economy, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Thursday. div &gt; div.group &gt; p:fi\u2026 [+2411 chars]", "fulltext": "With a month left until the Federal Reserve's next widely expected interest rate hike, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is facing a critical juncture that could determine the trajectory of the U.S. economy, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Thursday.\n\nAfter hearing Powell's remarks in a Wednesday interview with Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, Cramer felt that for the first time, Powell was growing cautious about the pace at which the Fed is raising rates. The central bank has said it plans to raise rates once more in December and three times in 2019.\n\nIn a question-and-answer session during the interview in Dallas, Powell acknowledged that the pace of global economic growth was slowing, but said it was \"not a terrible slowdown.\" Earlier this year, Powell said the Fed was \"a long way\" from neutral interest rates, signaling more hikes to come.\n\n\"Kaplan's questions allowed Powell to walk back his sadly intemperate comments from October, comments that seemed to be almost blithely oblivious to some of the more worrisome data out there,\" Cramer reflected on \"Mad Money.\" \"After all, there are degrees of slowdowns that, nonetheless, can cause an awful lot of havoc and cost a lot of jobs, and that's what we're on the verge of here.\"\n\nAnd after last night, it became clear that \"Powell gets it, too,\" Cramer said.

But in recent months, the company has changed course, opting to work more closely with Facebook and contribute to the development of Facebook's own flavor of free AI software.\n\nMicrosoft hasn't made a big deal about the change. But it reflects a willingness to back software that comes from other major technology companies, rather than focusing only on its own platforms.\n\nGoogle is the company behind the most popular open-source AI software, TensorFlow, which became available in late 2015. Microsoft put its Cognitive Toolkit, or CNTK, software on GitHub and gave it a more permissive open-source license in early 2016, and Facebook came out PyTorch, its answer to TensorFlow, later in 2016.\n\nThe Microsoft system has strengths, particularly for building speech recognition systems, but PyTorch has gained adoption quickly and has some interesting technical features of its own, Microsoft's chief technology officer, Kevin Scott, told CNBC in an interview this week.\n\nLast year, Scott met with Facebook's chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, and decided it would be good for the companies to attempt to \"defrag some of the complexity\" in the ecosystem of software that people can use to train AI models. In Sept. 2017 Facebook and Microsoft together introduced ONNX, a piece of open-source software for exporting models trained with one AI software framework, like Microsoft's Cognitive Toolkit, so that they can be used to make predictions with other frameworks, like Facebook's PyTorch.\n\n\"We have to be able to actually contribute back to the community,\" he said.\n\nThe reality is there are just too many AI frameworks out there, said Sai Soundararaj, cofounder and CEO of AI start-up FloydHub. The start-up's cloud service has supported Microsoft's Cognitive Toolkit, but it hasn't gotten much use from customers, Soundararaj said.\n\nMicrosoft hasn't abandoned Cognitive Toolkit, even as it's focusing more on other projects. The Microsoft software still receives updates.\n\nBut the direction is clear. \"The momentum of community, really, is around PyTorch and TensorFlow, and so that's where were throwing the bulk of our emphasis,\" said Eric Boyd, Microsoft's corporate vice president of AI platform. \"Having community adoption is hugely important.\"\n\nThe move around Cognitive Toolkit is part of a recent trend at Microsoft to embrace technology from outside the company. It has embraced Linux, making it accessible from within Windows 10 and creating a Linux version of its SQL Server database software. It has reduced its efforts around Windows for mobile devices and ramped up development of applications for Apple's iOS and Google's Android.

If you're fairly proficient in a language but it has no bearing on the job to which you are applying, don't bother adding it to your resume, says Augustine.\n\nBe mindful that the interviewer might speak the language and want to test your fluency, especially for common languages like Spanish. An inability to communicate clearly could end up making you look deceitful, casting doubt on the rest of your resume, says Augustine.\n\nIf you're hired without a test, your company might eventually expand to another country or conduct business with clients who speak a different language. As a result, your employer will quickly learn that you fibbed, a risk you shouldn't take when the role likely didn't require a foreign language in the first place.\n\nFor positions where a secondary language is desirable or crucial to the role, ask yourself whether you'd feel comfortable holding the entire interview in that language, says Augustine. She recommends that you also ask yourself if you'd be able to conduct business deals in that second language.\n\nFor native speakers, there's no downside to disclosing a foreign language. But do remember that you have limited space on your resume so you should still prioritize any job-related skills.\n\nIf you still want to include a language, provide context. Augustine suggests explaining whether you speak fluently or conversationally, for instance. Understand, however, that such descriptions are highly subjective and could create confusion.\n\nNo matter what you do, if you pretend you have a higher level of proficiency than you have, \"you're probably not going to land the job,\" says Augustine.\n\n\"You need to sell yourself,\" she says. \"If it doesn't help your candidacy, eliminate it.\"\n\nLike this story?

As one example, the Invesco KBW Bank ETF (KBWB) provides strong exposure in a concentrated ETF to Buffett's banking stocks, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund and ETF research at CFRA. Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, US Bancorp, Wells Fargo and Citigroup (one bank stock Berkshire doesn't own) make up 40 percent of the portfolio. \"This is higher than the cap weighted XLF that also holds insurance companies and capital markets ones or the equally weighted KBE,\" Rosenbluth said.\n\nKBWB also has among its top 10 holdings several of Buffett's other big bank bets, M&T Bank, PNC and Bank of New York Mellon.\n\nOf course there may be reasons why banks are cheaper than other stocks. The flattening yield curve remains a big challenge, particularly for regional banks, according to Mishra. And there is no shortage of factors to worry about, from the global economic slowdown to Brexit and regulatory risks due to Democratic takeover of the House and critical comments from Rep. Maxine Waters about financial companies, who now heads the Financial Services Committee in the House. Rising rates may also impact mortgage originations going forward.\n\nIn fact, that's why investors have been dumping financial ETFs. The biggest financial ETF, the Select Sector SPDR Financial (XLF) has lost about $2.4 billion this year. And most of the financial ETFs, including the bank plays, are in the red for 2018. XLF is down by more than 4 percent, \"though it rebounded slightly over the past month as there was some sector rotation out of earlier high-flying tech sector into beaten down sector,\" Mishra said. KBWB is down by close to six percent.\n\nMeanwhile, Mishra described big bank Q3 earnings as \"good,\" supported by consumer banking and cost controls.\n\nBut if there one thing investors should know about Buffett, he isn't trying to time the market, and he isn't buying based on some P/E trade that will play out over the next three months. And the P/E ratio may seem inexpensive compared to other sectors, but there are other ways to look at it.\n\nXLF is currently trading at 12.4 times forward earnings, which looks attractive compared with long-term historical averages, but it has been even lower at other recent points of comparison. Over the last five years, it has traded between roughly 10 and 14 times. \"Bank valuations have been, in general, remained subdued since the financial crisis even though they are much better capitalized now,\" Mishra said.\n\nThere are additional ETF options. Mishra recommended XLF, which even though it is not a bank-only play, includes Berkshire Hathaway, J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, US Bancorp, American Express, Goldman Sachs and PNC in its top holdings, accounting for roughly 50 percent of the portfolio.\n\nOther ETFs with similar exposure include the Vanguard Financials Index ETF (VFH). The iShares US Financial Services ETF (IYG) also has some of the Buffett's favorite banks as its top holdings \u2014 J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, US Bancorp, American Express and Goldman Sachs account for more than 35 percent of the portfolio.\n\nWhen Buffett in the early years of his original investment partnership became known around town, both Omaha and Wall Street, as a stock picker to follow, he was still mostly buying stocks that were cheap and would be worth more once they were broken up and sold off for the value of their parts. But that changed as Berkshire grew in size, and he became more sensitive to the human impact of shutting down firms, and especially as his relationship with Charlie Munger, Berkshire's vice chairman, evolved. Munger helped to migrate Buffett to a method of evaluating the quality of companies rather than just their break-up value. \"Fair companies at wonderful prices\" was replaced as the investment thesis with \"wonderful companies at fair prices.\"\n\nBuffett also would sometimes get miffed that people would be piling into his stock bets. \"Riding his coattails\" was not something he considered to be an ethical practice. But that was decades before everyone had access to 13F quarterly stock holdings filings in seconds, and well before the rise of ETFs.\n\nFor more of Buffett's views consult CNBC's Warren Buffett Archive, the world's largest collection of Buffett speaking about business, investing, money and life."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "CNBC Press Release", "title": "CNBC Exclusive: CNBC Transcript: Bridgewater Associates Founder, Co-Chair and Co-Chief Investment Officer Ray Dalio Speaks with CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin Today", "description": "", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/15/cnbc-exclusive-cnbc-transcript-bridgewater-associates-founder-co-chair-and-co-chief-investment-officer-ray-dalio-speaks-with-cnbcs-andrew-ross-sorkin-today.html", "urlToImage": "https://sc.cnbcfm.com/applications/cnbc.com/staticcontent/img/cnbc_logo.gif", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T16:36:00Z", "content": "WHEN: Today, Thursday, November 15, 2018 WHERE: CNBC's \" Squawk Box \" The following is the unofficial transcript of a CNBC interview with Bridgewater Associates Founder, Co-Chairman and Co-Chief Investment Officer Ray Dalio and CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin on CN\u2026 [+15266 chars]", "fulltext": "WHEN: Today, Thursday, November 15, 2018\n\nWHERE: CNBC's \"Squawk Box\"\n\nThe following is the unofficial transcript of a CNBC interview with Bridgewater Associates Founder, Co-Chairman and Co-Chief Investment Officer Ray Dalio and CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin on CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" (M-F 6AM \u2013 9AM) today, Thursday, November 15th.

Nasdaq would be up to \u2013 just marginally about 2.5 points and S&P 500 off by 4 points. Things have swung around. We want to get right now to our first \"Squawk Box\" newsmaker of the hour, joining us from the Greenwich Economic Forum: Ray Dalio is here, founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates. Good morning, ray, thanks for joining us.\n\nRAY DALIO: Good morning and welcome to Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nSORKIN: Thank you for that. We want to get your sense of where we are in what seems like a very complicated market these days. We have a lot of volatility. We have questions about tariffs and trade, of course and interest rates. You've always put the markets in the context of the economic machine. So where are we within that machine?\n\nDALIO: Well, you know, there's the short-term debt cycle, long-term debt cycle and productivity. We're in the late stages, maybe the seventh, the eighth inning of the business cycle, right? We're in the part of the cycle where there's been a lot of monetary easing. Central banks bought $15 trillion worth of assets, pushed them up a lot. We had the benefit of a corporate tax cut, all of that stimulation, and as a result, we're in the late part of cycle where there's a tightening of monetary policy. And you know, so it's kind of the late part of the cycle with assets fully priced. And in terms of the longer-term debt cycle, we're at a point where interest rates are comparatively low, the capacity of central banks to ease monetary policy is limited, United States is limited, and other counties it's limited. So that's where we ar. We're in a position also where we have the emerging power China competing with the United States, an established power, as an effective power competitor. That's very much like the late 1930s. So that's where I think we are.\n\nSORKIN: Let me just go back a second. The 1930s are a complicated time. But specifically, on the issue of the fed and interest rates in terms of where we are in the cycle, there is a debate, as you know, about whether interest rates should get hiked and how strong the economy really is or isn't. What do you think?\n\nDALIO: Right now, the Fed expects to raise it one more time this year. And probably three \u2013 two or three times next year. I think there's a problem in terms of asset prices. I think that rate of increase would not be able to be made because we've raised interest rates to a level where it's hurting asset prices. We have now, a flat yield curve. We have -- in other words, the -- you can now get in a two to five-year note, you can get about 3%. And you have no price, no material price risk. So, we're in a situation right now that the Fed, I think, will have to look at asset prices before they look at economic activity. It's a difficult position because that stimulation that they have, in the form of those tax cuts, is a big stimulation into the capacity limitations as we have low slack. So that the economy itself will pressure them to raise rates. I think probably too much. I think we have a supply/demand problem for bonds that will particularly come next year and the year after. In other words, because of that tax cut and the deficits, we'll have to sell a lot more bonds and United States itself can't absorb that quantity of bonds. So we're going to have to sell those bonds to investors in other countries. You look at the portfolio of those, and they have a lot of those that are sort of overweight in that bond. So I think there's a supply/demand imbalance and a difficult position for the Federal Reserve. It's a risky situation.\n\nSORKIN: Just to put a fine point on it though, it sounds like you're recommending if you're Jay Powell, you might slow down, similarly to what the President suggested?\n\nDALIO: Yes. I would look at what is discounted in the curve. And realize that that's discounted in all asset prices. It's discounted in bonds. It's discounted in equities. It's discounted in real estate equities, private equities -- that rate of change in there. And I would keep it certainly not faster than that, and I would probably keep it probably less than that. I think the -- you know, the risks of asymmetric on the downside, because if we have a little bit overshoot in the inflation rate, you're going to be in a position where it's not going to be a problem. Who cares if you have 2.5% or something, it's not going to run out of control. But if you have a downturn, first in asset prices and then you have a downturn in the economy, it's an asymmetric risk. It's a serious risk. We have an economic polarity in populism which is an issue. If you have a downturn, I think the conflict is going to be greater, I think that's a big issue. And I think also, the tools are not as effective on the downside, so I would err on the side of easier monetary policy -- on the curve.\n\nSORKIN: Let me ask you a question: if you're concerned about asset prices, one of your peers, Dan Loeb recently just wrote, \"we have delevered our portfolio, reduced our tech exposure meaningfully and grown our short book. We expect to be net sellers over the next few months if markets rally.\" As an investor out there right now, how cautious are you?\n\nDALIO: Well, as I said I think we're in the -- we've gotten a lot of the good news behind us and I think assets are fully priced and I think there is asymmetric risk. Like I said, I won't talk about our positions, but I think -- I think the upside position is not as strong and relative to the risk.\n\nJOE KERNEN: Ray, that made never made much sense to me, but you said we have the tools to address a downturn. Some people think we need to raise rates to get to a point where we can cut them if we need to cut them. Does that make any sense to you -- ?\n\nDALIO: That sounds like pretty bad logic to me.\n\nKERNEN: You know what they're saying. If you're up there at six, you can keep cutting. But when you're all the way down near zero, you don't have a lot of cuts that you can make in case there's a downturn. But --\n\nDALIO: Yeah, but \u2013\n\nKERNEN: -- to go all the way down is crazy.\n\nDALIO: Yeah, but look -- I'm telling you what's built into the curve, what's built into all of the markets is the existing interest rates.\n\nKERNEN: Right.\n\nDALIO: So you raise that way if that's not good. I think the Federal Reserve should use more macro prudential policies. In other words, there are parts right now, there are some bubbles emerging. But macro prudential policies, what that means, if there's a regulatory authority that can deal with certain bubbles as they're emerging to be more targeted, than using interest rates as a whole.\n\nSORKIN: And, Ray, talking about bubbles, do you worry about high-yield bonds? We were having a conversation earlier today actually about General Electric, a Connecticut-based company whose debt has come under a lot of pressure of late.\n\nKERNEN: Boston based.\n\nSORKIN: Now Boston based, yeah.\n\nDALIO: the -- a lot of the high-yield debt market has gone into leveraged loans and CLO. And so, as a result, it's off balance sheet -- I mean, it's private. And there are parts of that market more than the particular high yield debt market; although if I was to take double \"b,\" some triple \"b\" types of debt, I think that it's more than fully priced.\n\nBECKY QUICK: But, Ray, I'm wondering if you can shed a little light on what might happen to the junk market if GE heads towards junk status. I mean, it's kind of trading there based on the credit default swaps at this point. It's headed that direction. If that were to happen, you're talking about ge becoming 10% of a $1.2 trillion market. And that seems like an awful lot to absorb. What kind of aftershocks would that potentially have?\n\nDALIO: BECAUSE -- I think GE's problems are well recognized in the market.\n\nQUICK: Right.\n\nDALIO: And probably reflecting those. Because there's a lot of index funds or ETFs where the investor experiencing a sting looks at that asset as a number of assets, you could have more contagion to the other markets, as they say I don't want that kind of fund and then even less stress funds would experience some sort of contagion. So, yeah, there is that kind of risk.\n\nSORKIN: Ray, I wanted to ask you about China. I know you just announced a new fund that's actually going to be based in China and you've spent a lot of time there. Obviously we are in the middle of what some have already called a trade war, given the tariffs. Just speak to what you think about the potential trade war and how you think it will ultimately shake out.\n\nDALIO: I think -- the trade war I think can be worked out, trade balances I think from a Chinese perspective, American perspective. But it goes way beyond the trade war, you know? There is this now competition, real competition, for -- in the world, in supremacy. This is the first time since the '30s that we've had an emerging country that is a comparable power, really, to the United States. And there are issues there. So, those issues have to do with property rights, they have to do with access competition, they have -- they're geopolitical. There are a number of things. I think that the trade issues can honestly be dealt with. But it is, you know, it's a broader issue that will be with us for a long time. And I think what most fundamentally it has to do is a different approach to life. A different approach to how they think governments should work. As one of the Chinese leaders described, it's basically a top-down, versus a bottom-up type of approach, you know. If you were to look at let's say gaming, by way of example, playing games, video games and you go in China, they will have a point of view as to what their kids should watch on video games. That exemplifies this. So they will control -- it can't be a certain amount of hours and it can't be these types of games and so on. And so that would be a top-down decision. In the United States, we would not want the government \u2013 the system is a bottom-up. So, it really goes back to Confucius, in 500 B.C., it's a very different approach. And that is -- so, when you look at the 2025 plan in China, the government believes that they should have a plan for making China great. And they work that plan. And then they'll have coordination between the parts. So, yes, the military will cooperate with the tech companies and so on. That kind of activity is objectionable to the United States because that is viewed as something that is different. So, that kind of identity issue, or those types of rivalries, will be with us for a long time, even though the trade issue itself I think can be dealt with.\n\nSORKIN: Ray, before we let you go, I want to talk about a perhaps more local issue than this global issue, which is where you're based right now. And the conference that you're attending. And I know there's a number of big speakers, including yourself later today. This is the Greenwich Economic Forum. But there's a big question right now about hedge funds and Connecticut. The state of Connecticut. Taxes in Connecticut. Whether it's actually the right place for firms like yours to be based, given the tax rates there. How are you thinking about that, given that some of your peers have left the state?\n\nDALIO: Well, you see what Greenwich, Connecticut is. I mean, it's a fabulous town right outside of New York City. So easy access to the city. Fabulous community. And then its vitality, it's great intellectually, it's very stimulating. There's a culture here that is great, community, all of those things. And then there's this issue of the state issues. I think that the state is going to approach this in a very effective way. We'll see. You know, there's a new government and so we'll see how. But the approach that even New York took, in terms of Long Island City and the bringing in, creating a tax-free economic zone. For example, you could take Bridgeport, and you could take New Haven, and you could take Hartford, Connecticut, and make those tax-free economic zones and bring in vitality to the state. I think that it's really going to be a test of the cleverness. And it's an issue that they're going to have to deal with one way or another. It could be very harmful to the state. It's a risky issue because the polarity between the high-income areas and the other parts of the state, which are really suffering, cannot be touched it's a challenge.\n\nKERNEN: Before you pull up states and move down to zero income tax Florida with Tepper, you might wait for the recounts. Just, I don't know -- wait a couple of weeks before you decide.\n\nSORKIN: He's not deciding. He's staying there.\n\nKERNEN: No, I know.\n\nSORKIN: By the way, what do you think of your peers that have moved to Florida?\n\nKERNEN: The joke's on them, maybe.\n\nDALIO: Well, I think the tax issue is an issue of consideration and the worst case scenario is a bad scenario for, not just Connecticut, but some of the Northeast -- New Jersey is a good example, and New York, different parts. And i think that model has to be department with by bringing in a lot more revenue, by creating, you know, a different approach. But I -- it's understandable. It's not just -- it's the whole area. Wherever you have taxes. San Francisco is dealing with the same thing with -- like Nevada. It's a national issue.\n\nQUICK: Ray, we only have a few seconds but very quickly, what you're talking about, creating these zones it coming under protest from people in New York City right now.\n\nDALIO: I'm sorry, I didn't get that. Say it again, please?\n\nQUICK: People are protesting the tax giveaways to these wealthy companies, like you mentioned for Long Island City.\n\nDALIO: No, no, yeah, I'm saying, I think if you take -- I don't think you can cut taxes. You have to raise tax revenue.\n\nSORKIN: Right.\n\nDALIO: The issue of raising tax revenue is -- it's much the same as if we're looking at amazon going to Long Island City.\n\nSORKIN: Right.\n\nDALIO: Is that going to be a net benefit? Or is that not going to be a net benefit? And you got to take a sharp pencil. If you take a free economic zone, I've seen this happen in a lot of places, and the impact of companies who are not there coming into a tax-free economic zone brings net revenue. And we need net revenue. Because you can't cut expenses. It's not humane. And you can't raise taxes. Because if you raise taxes people are going to leave more. So you have to have something like that.\n\nSORKIN: Ray, we want to thank you. It's a pleasure. You have to get to a panel. We have some breaking news to get to as well. We want to -- we appreciate your time. Thank you as always. And we look forward to seeing you again very soon. I think in Davos, hopefully.\n\nFor more information contact:\n\nJennifer Dauble\n\nCNBC\n\nt: 201.735.4721\n\nm: 201.615.2787\n\ne: jennifer.dauble@nbcuni.com\n\nEmma Martin\n\nCNBC\n\nt: 201.735.4713\n\nm: 551.275.6221\n\ne: emma.martin@nbcuni.com"}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Sarah Berger", "title": "These stores are offering the best Black Friday deals for 2018", "description": "These are the stores offering the deepest discounts for Black Friday 2018, according to WalletHub.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/15/wallethub-best-shopping-deals-for-black-friday-2018.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/11/23/104860468-GettyImages-878005886.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T16:32:00Z", "content": "Many seasoned shoppers know that Black Friday the day after Thanksgiving, this year Nov. 23 is a great day to score deep discounts on everything from clothes to tech gadgets.

That year, America Rising poured $1.4 million into the election and raised $1.3 million through top Republican donors such as billionaire hedge-fund manager Paul Singer.\n\nThe super PAC is looking to play up some of Bloomberg's controversial statements about women, including his recent remarks to The New York Times about news anchor Charlie Rose and the #MeToo movement.\n\n\"The stuff I read about is disgraceful \u2014 I don't know how true all of it is,\" he told the newspaper in September.

It's in the U.S. national interest to be at the table and see an outcome that emphasizes transparency, holds countries accountable,\" said one of the sources, who is familiar with State Department plans.\n\nThe White House and the State Department did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe United States, the world's top oil and gas producer, is the only country to have announced its intention to formally withdraw from the Paris accord.\n\nThe administration's resistance has come against a backdrop of increasingly urgent warnings from scientists about the threats posed by greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. The panel will come less than two months after the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in a report that the world's use of coal for generating power will need to be nearly eliminated by mid-century \u2013 to between 1 and 7 percent of the global mix, from around 40 percent now - to help prevent deadly droughts, storms and floods brought on by climate change.\n\n\"Quite frankly, the U.S. is the only party to the convention that appears to be willing to push a rational discussion on the role of cleaner, more efficient fossil (fuels) and the role of civilian nuclear energy,\" said one of the sources, who is involved in the planning of the event for Katowice, likely to be held on Dec. 10.\n\nThe source, who did not want to be named due to the sensitive nature of the issue, said the event will be dominated by proponents of coal and natural gas and likely advanced nuclear power, too. The panel will also likely feature a U.S. Energy Department representative. At this point plans do not include a renewable power industry representative, the source said.\n\nThe event is expected to be led by Wells Griffith, Trump's international energy and climate adviser, the sources added. Griffith's main energy policy experience involves a year at a political job at the Department of Energy and helping to set up a deal last year to supply Ukraine with U.S. coal after the country lost control of mines to Russian-backed separatists.\n\nTwo-tiered approach\n\nTrump last year announced his intent to leave the Paris agreement, calling it harmful to the U.S. economy and casting doubt on the climate science underpinning the accord.\n\nAs per U.N. rules, Trump's administration will not be able to leave the pact until a day after the 2020 presidential election, and U.S. officials recognize that finishing the rule book and making sure developing countries such as China are held to verifiable emissions cuts are in the national interest.\n\nLast year, the fossil fuels event set up by the White House drew widespread protest and condemnation from climate activists. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg wrote on Twitter that \"Promoting coal at a climate summit is like promoting tobacco at a cancer summit.\"\n\nAt the same time, 40 career officials from the State Department and other agencies continued their work on the Paris pact's rule book.

And in 12 of those times, there's war,\" said Dalio, in a cautionary tone, while reiterating his belief that the narrow trade dispute between the U.S. and China can be worked out.\n\nA step towards a trade deal could start with a meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping around the summit of the Group of 20 leaders later this month in Argentina.\n\nAlleging a myriad of unfair trade practices, Trump initiated tariffs in March to pressure China to change its ways.\n\nIn September, the White House imposed its latest round of levies focused on $200 billion of Chinese products. In response, China put tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods.\n\nTrump has also threatened additional tariffs of $267 billion, which would basically cover the rest of all Chinese imports into the U.S.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Angelica LaVito", "title": "FDA restricts most flavored e-cig sales to curb 'astonishing' teen vaping surge, pursues menthol ban", "description": "Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb outlined a slew of policies, including restrictions on sales of flavored e-cigarettes, and essentially threatened to pull products from the market if manufacturers do not follow them.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/15/fda-restricts-most-flavored-e-cigarette-sales-pursues-menthol-ban.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/10/26/104800387-GettyImages-844304082.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T15:09:00Z", "content": "The FDA will require all types of flavored e-cigarettes, excluding menthol, to be sold by retailers that altogether prohibit people under the age of 18, the federal minimum age to buy tobacco products, or have a section of the store that bars minors.

However, Gottlieb said the agency will reconsider the exemption if data show kids are using these products.\n\nAnti-tobacco groups applauded the FDA taking some action but said it didn't go far enough. Truth Initiative CEO Robin Koval told CNBC she urges the agency to ban flavored e-cigarettes outright and, in the meantime, include mint in the retail restrictions.\n\nE-cigarette manufacturers that wish to sell flavored products more broadly in the future must first submit the products to the FDA to review and authorize. The FDA will require products that are found illegally being sold in stores to undergo review and would be pulled from the market until the agency completes the application process and clears it, which it may not. In the process, known as a premarket tobacco application, products must prove they deliver a net public health benefit.\n\nAll e-cigarettes currently on the market will eventually go through this process. Products that were on the market before Aug. 8, 2016, were supposed to start undergoing review this year until Gottlieb extended the deadline until Aug. 8, 2022, so manufacturers would have more time to file complete applications.\n\nCompanies who do not comply with new FDA-mandated age verification guidelines for online sales or are marketed to children, including by using popular children's cartoons or names of kid-favorite products like brands of candy or soda, would lose this extension and be required to undergo review.\n\nGottlieb said the FDA will explore how to accelerate the process for new technologies that prove they can keep kids from using them. Fontem Ventures, a unit of Imperial Brands and maker of blu e-cigarettes, and Juul have both said they plan to test new connected devices outside of the U.S.\n\nSome manufacturers have already started taking action on flavors. Altria said it will voluntarily remove its MarkTen pod-based products from the market and will stop selling all flavors except for menthol or tobacco in its \"cig-a-like\" products until the FDA reviews and clears them.\n\nJuul, the clear e-cigarette market leader, on Tuesday stopped accepting retail orders for its mango, fruit, creme and cucumber pods from the more than 90,000 convenience stores, vape shops and other retailers that sell them, CEO Kevin Burns said Tuesday in a blog post on the company's website. Juul plans to resume sales to retailers that are legally allowed to sell flavored e-cigarettes and adopt the company's new age restrictions and verification system, though it's unclear when sales could resume.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Juul said it is \"committed\" to working with the FDA and others to prevent minors from using e-cigarettes.

With operations in New Zealand and California, Rocket Lab is increasing production as it tries to launch one rocket a month by next year and then one every two weeks, Beck said.\n\nIts factories \"have been specifically designed to produce one rocket a week,\" Beck said\n\nElectron reached orbit for the first time in January. Despite an issue with one of the rocket's systems delaying its second orbital launch for several months, Rocket Lab has a sizable lead on the rest of the industry. Competitors Virgin Orbit, Vector and Astra Space are deep into testing programs but have yet to reach orbit. Beck estimates there are over 100 companies in total trying to catch up.\n\nBeck said this latest investment round shows that \"Rocket Lab is maturing\" and attracting Wall Street interest. While investment money is the \"most accessible\" among venture firms and sovereign wealth, Spice said he's \"getting more calls\" from the likes of J.P. Morgan.\n\n\"We've got the biggest of the big names on the financial side kind of kicking the tires on participating,\" Spice said.\n\nBeck said it's too early to know when a Rocket Lab IPO would happen, as the company has \"a few things we want to execute first.\"\n\n\"We want to get the launch cadence right up there,\" Beck said. \"There's a little bit more I need to achieve.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Reuters", "title": "US import prices increase more than expected in October", "description": "U.S. import prices increased more than expected in October, boosted by a surge in petroleum and food prices, but underlying imported inflation pressures remained tame amid a strong dollar.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/15/us-import-prices-oct-2018.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/08/03/104630879-GettyImages-618377404-trade-port.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T13:45:00Z", "content": "U.S. import prices increased more than expected in October, boosted by a surge in petroleum and food prices, but underlying imported inflation pressures remained tame amid a strong dollar.

Housing is remarkably cheaper, Edd Staton said. The couple rents a 4-bedroom luxurious penthouse apartment with 4 \u00bd bathrooms for $700 a month.\n\nSince the Statons are both over age 65, they pay 15 cents for local transportation (which would otherwise cost 30 cents), and a crosstown cab ride is between $2 and $3.\n\nThey pay less than $60 for the month's utility bills, including electricity, water and sewer, and gas. Perhaps most surprising was that when costs do rise, it's by a tiny amount. \"When a head of broccoli is 70 cents instead of 60 cents, that's a big percentage increase, but so what?\" Staton said.\n\nBefore you go Although it's possible to survive in many countries using just English, it's always a great idea to learn some basics of the language of your new home. You'll have a much better chance of integrating and feeling more at home, says the website Expat Info Desk. Your research should include looking into what type of visa would best suit your situation. Ecuador, for instance, has seven types of visas for permanent residents, according to the website Gringos Abroad. Finding good health care is a concern for most retirees.

After a recent health issue, the Statons were surprised when the doctor stopped by their apartment to see how Cynthia was feeling.\n\nSince their monthly budget is less than $2,000, the Statons afford all this on their Social Security alone. They do not have to touch their savings, which allows interest to grow and compound. Another surprising advantage of living abroad is the generous return on investments. Using a local financial institution, \"we have one-year government-insured CDs earning 9.5 percent per year,\" Staton said.\n\n\"You can live for more or less than this, depending on the location and lifestyle choices,\" Staton said. \"In any case it's important to have some amount of savings to draw on in case of emergencies or unexpected expenses.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Ruth Umoh", "title": "Mark Cuban: Here's why you should teach your kids to be entrepreneurs", "description": "Billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban shares the key advantages that entrepreneurial kids have later in life.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/15/mark-cuban-heres-why-you-should-teach-your-kids-to-be-entrepreneurs.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/11/30/104871303-GettyImages-610936138.1910x1000.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T13:30:00Z", "content": "McCue agrees. \"Being proactive and creating opportunities not waiting for them is crucial to success whether you are studying at college, starting your own business or working for a company.\" Being an entrepreneur at a young age can also teach you about failu\u2026 [+1599 chars]", "fulltext": "\"It scares the s*** out of me,\" billionaire Mark Cuban says of AI 1:37 PM ET Tue, 25 July 2017 | 00:59\n\nMcCue agrees. \"Being proactive and creating opportunities \u2013 not waiting for them \u2013 is crucial to success whether you are studying at college, starting your own business or working for a company.\"\n\nBeing an entrepreneur at a young age can also teach you about failure, says Patel, the founder of SAT test prep company Prep Expert. \"The older you get the harder it becomes to deal with the financial, social and emotional repercussions of failure.\"\n\nKid business owners are often students, McCue tells CNBC Make It, meaning that they learn early how to \"get more done in less time.\" This can easily translate to the workplace, where employees are typically pulled in many directions.\n\nCuban himself demonstrated an entrepreneurial spirit from a young age.

The big-box retailer's revenue fell short of analysts' estimates, however, due to currency headwinds. It's taken a hit in recent quarters due to increased investments overseas.\n\nWalmart shares ended the day down nearly 2 percent. With Thursday's losses, the stock is up more than 10 percent from a year ago, bringing Walmart's market cap to roughly $291.5 billion.\n\nHere's what Walmart reported compared with what analysts were expecting, based on a survey by Refinitiv:\n\n* Earnings per share: $1.08, adjusted, vs. $1.01 expected\n\n* Revenue: $124.89 billion vs. $125.55 billion expected\n\n* Same-store sales: up 3.4 percent in the U.S. vs. growth of 3.1 percent expected\n\n\"We have momentum in the business as we execute our plan and benefit from a favorable economic environment in the U.S.,\" CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement.\n\nWalmart reported net income for the fiscal third quarter of $1.71 billion, or 58 cents a share, compared with $1.75 billion, or 58 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding one-time items, Walmart earned $1.08 per share, 7 cents ahead of analysts' expectations based on a survey by Refinitiv.\n\nRevenue climbed 1.4 percent to $124.89 billion from $123.18 billion a year ago, falling short of expectations for $125.55 billion. Excluding impacts from currency, revenue was $126.1 billion.\n\nSales at stores in the U.S. open for at least 12 months were up 3.4 percent, better than growth of 3.1 percent expected by analysts. Walmart said traffic at stores was up 1.2 percent during the quarter, with the average shopper's ticket up 2.2 percent. CFO Brett Biggs told CNBC that grocery helped fuel those results, as Walmart now has a grocery pick-up option at roughly 2,100 stores across the U.S., and grocery delivery at about 600 locations.\n\nOnline sales were up 43 percent during the third quarter, and Biggs said the company is still on track to meet its goal of 40 percent e-commerce sales growth for the full year. A year ago, digital sales climbed 50 percent, as the company just started to lap its acquisition of Jet.com.\n\nThere's been some concern that as the U.S. economy cools off, however, Walmart's results won't be as strong. But some analysts still view the company as a beneficiary, \"independent of how the macroenvironment is.\"\n\n\"We're probably about six months away from a slower consumer spending environment, as the boost from the tax reform starts to fade,\" UBS analyst Michael Lasser told CNBC. \"And so there's a move away from some of the retailers that were disproportionately benefiting from that, to more safe-haven defensive-type retailers like Walmart.\"\n\nThough there are uncertainties around rising interest rates and rising costs because of tariffs, Lasser said, \"Walmart has a good plan\" in place to work around them. That includes deploying robots and other technology in stores so that the company can save money and put resources toward more labor-intensive tasks, he said.\n\nIn a recorded message, Biggs expressed confidence in the retailer's plan, saying, \"We feel good about our competitive position heading into the holiday season. The business remains strong, we're executing our strategy well...\"\n\nPart of that strategy this year is to be focused on expanding its merchandise assortment online. One way it's doing this is by acquiring digital brands, including most recently plus-size fashion retailer Eloquii and intimates company Bare Necessities. The head of Walmart's U.S. e-commerce business, Marc Lore, recently said Walmart could one day own more than 40 of these e-commerce retailers.\n\nWith this growth, Walmart is expected to overtake Apple as the third-largest e-commerce retailer by sales in 2018, falling only behind Amazon and eBay, according to a new report from eMarketer. Walmart is expected to take 4 percent of U.S. e-commerce sales, or roughly $20.9 billion, the market research firm said.\n\n\"We have an opportunity to improve the margin mix in this business, and we'll do this by expanding the tail of the [online] assortment through first-party items and marketplace,\" McMillon said Thursday.\n\nLooking to the full year, Walmart now expects same-store sales in the U.S. to rise \"at least\" 3 percent, compared with a previous outlook of \"about\" 3 percent. It says adjusted earnings per share will fall within a range of $4.75 to $4.85, up from a prior range of $4.65 to $4.80.\n\nIn October, Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer for Walmart U.S., told reporters that its plans was \"building up to what we think will be the best holiday yet.\"\n\nInternationally, Walmart has been looking for ways to grow to outpace its rivals like Amazon and Alibaba, including in China, Canada and the U.K.\n\nIt recently paid $16 billion to acquire a majority stake in Indian e-commerce company Flipkart, as one example, to get a foothold in that fast-growing economy. The CEO of Flipkart, Binny Bansal, resigned earlier this week after an internal probe into \"serious personal misconduct.\"\n\nInternational sales fell 2.6 percent during the third quarter to $28.8 billion, partly due to the company selling a majority of its Brazilian business to private equity firm Advent International. Walmart said same-store sales were positive in 9 out of 10 markets where it operates overseas."}, {"source": {"id": "cnbc", "name": "CNBC"}, "author": "Spriha Srivastava", "title": "US bond yields tick lower amid sterling plunge", "description": "U.S. government debt prices ticked higher as investors kept their focus on political news as well as economic data.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/15/us-bond-yields-tick-lower-amid-sterling-plunge.html", "urlToImage": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/10/18/105516135-1539894270325gettyimages-1052189700.1910x1000.jpeg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T10:19:00Z", "content": "Concerns over an oversupply in oil markets continues to dominate the market.

The Camp Fire was 35 percent contained early Wednesday, according to Cal Fire.\n\nDanko also represents a group of plaintiffs suing PG&E over the 2017 wine country fires, a group of Northern California blazes. Cal Fire has pinned the blame on PG&E in at least 16 wildfires in last year's fire siege, including some blazes with fatalities.\n\nAccording to Danko, other California utilities do a better job of \"mitigating the risk. For example, in Southern California when there are windy conditions, the utilities as a matter of routine for some time have shut off the power so that if the lines come down it won't spark a fire. That's something that PG&E never did until after the wine country fires.\"\n\nThe attorney claims PG&E sent out emails indicating it would shut off power before the Camp Fire but didn't do it. \"Their meteorologists were watching the conditions, and then they decided not to,\" he said. \"They decided to leave the power on.\"\n\nPG&E's Tostado said, \"The safety of our customers and the communities we serve is our highest priority. Right now, our primary focus is on the communities, supporting first responders and getting our crews positioned and ready to respond when we get access, so that we can safely restore gas and electricity to our customers.\"\n\nThe electrical outage that PG&E experienced in Butte County was to a 115kV transmission line and the damage observed near the fire was to a 115kV transmission line. The utility spokesperson said \"115kV transmission lines are not currently part of the Public Safety Power Shutoff program due to a variety of safety and regulatory factors.\"\n\nStill, Danko alleges that PG&E has \"nefarious\" reasons for keeping the power on.\n\n\"PG&E does not want to shut off power for the reason that management bonuses are tied not to safety, but rather the lack of customer complaints,\" Danko said. He said when the power is shut off to customers they complain so management is therefore hesitant to flip the power off.\n\nDanko said he plans to subpoena PG&E's witnesses and their documents to get even more information on the incident.\n\nEarlier this year, PG&E and its parent renewed liability insurance coverage for wildfire events for approximately $1.4 billion, covering the period from Aug. 1, 2018, through July 31, 2019.\n\nThe state legislature already has given PG&E some relief that allows them in the event of a wildfire to sell bonds to essentially pay for damages. That relief, known as state Senate Bill 901, was approved by Gov. Jerry Brown on Sept. 21 and followed the catastrophic wine country fires last year.\n\n\"If they file bankruptcy, so be it,\" said Danko. \"That means that ultimately their equipment is essentially auctioned off. Perhaps someone more responsible will end up operating the electric and gas facilities.\""}]
