Tech is not the main problem here \u2014 it is a question of business strategy.\n\nDeliveroo denies that it is an employer to its delivery drivers, and does not pay social contributions for them. It saves the company costs, but we question the assertion that riders are small entrepreneurs or self-employed.\n\nThi\u00e9baut Weber, confederal secretary, European Trade Union Confederation\n\nNot all gig economy platforms operate like this.\n\nThis year, the Foodora platform (a Deliveroo competitor) established a European works council and signed an agreement with trade unions in Germany and Italy. Riders there are workers and one rider is a trade union representative on the company\u2019s supervisory board.\n\nIn Denmark, the website Hilfr.dk, which offers cleaning services for private homes, signed an agreement with the union 3F. Workers are self-employed, but the most regular ones become employees and they benefit from a minimum wage, sick pay, holiday allowances and pension contributions.\n\nIt shows that other ways of operating are possible and it is disappointing that Deliveroo has failed to enter into a proper dialogue with its riders. Such concerns made it impossible for judges to reach agreement on the company\u2019s inclusion in the list of digital champions.\n\nThe case for including Deliveroo\n\nBy Gisele I. Karekezi, Europe regional manager, AngelHack\n\nWe cannot deny the immense impact Deliveroo has had in Europe in changing the face of the restaurant industry. It has a valuation of $2bn and revenues that doubled in 2017.\n\nAgainst this backdrop and given that these are the major criteria we use in selection, I believe that Deliveroo should have been included.\n\nGisele I Karekezi, Europe regional manager, AngelHack\n\nInnovation is neither good or bad. Society does expect disrupters to do more to mitigate the negative outcomes, but that is a different question.\n\nDeliveroo is probably not doing enough to mitigate the negative aspects of its innovation, and should be doing more to address the manner over how it treats its labour, but it still should be on our list.\n\nEurope is ahead of the rest of the world when it comes to talking about the ethics of technology \u2014 I doubt the discussions we had among the jury members would have happened elsewhere. That is quite powerful, but we cannot have the conversation if we sweep the issue under the carpet by not including Deliveroo on the list."}, {"source": {"id": "financial-times", "name": "Financial Times"}, "author": null, "title": "Europe plays catch-up in digital innovation", "description": "The continent needs to shout louder about its strengths in research and skilled staff", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/02287b86-ad37-11e8-8253-48106866cd8a", "urlToImage": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F5541faca-e21d-11e8-a6e5-792428919cee?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T04:00:29Z", "content": "Europe faces an innovation gap.

Despite being home to some of the world\u2019s leading engineering and pharmaceuticals groups, it lags the US and China in applying digital technology to a fresh generation of products and services. Companies such as Alphabet, Facebook, Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 global leaders in consumer technology \u2014 were all founded outside Europe.\n\nBut there are signs of change across the continent. Europe has a strong record of research and development, accounting for 20 per cent of global R&D spending. Venture capital has poured into start-ups and growth companies, with clusters forming in cities from London to Paris and Berlin. Incumbents, facing disruption in their industries, are adopting new approaches.\n\nThe Europe\u2019s Road to Growth project starts from the principle that the continent still needs to accelerate if it is to rival digital innovation elsewhere in the world. That will require a change of approach \u2014 not just by creating start-ups but by building on Europe\u2019s strengths, including its universities, scientific research and a trained workforce.\n\nThe project looked for leading examples of companies changing how they operate to grow faster and identify new customers. Incumbents face the trickiest task \u2014 not starting with a blank sheet but trying to rebuild what they have. Alongside them, we wanted to identify the technology companies that are helping others to succeed by providing them with new software tools.\n\nThe Europe\u2019s Road to Growth judges discuss the nominations in Brussels \u00a9 Sarah Van Looy\n\nDespite trailing behind the US, Europe is home to some highly disruptive companies: Revolut and Raisin in financial services, as well as Booking.com and Amadeus in travel, for example. We also tried to find organisations applying new technologies to social problems, and individuals who have led digital change. Lastly, we included a category for digital training providers, given the reskilling need.\n\nAfter a call-out for nominations last summer, we received a gratifying 4,000 entries. They were incredibly varied, from the tiniest to the largest company. Entries ranged from ThyssenKrupp\u2019s elevator technology to small dental surgeries talking about setting up a Facebook page. More than a quarter of the submissions were from small companies.\n\nGoing online is no longer a radical step for most organisations, but it remains an experiment for some. Stilo e Stile is a pen shop in Rome that was saved from going out of business when the owner\u2019s son set up an ecommerce presence for the first time. The shop started selling through platforms including Google, Amazon and eBay. Its owner, Mario Pagnozzi, wrote of the experience: \u201cThe transformation of a familiar business is not easy. Think about a 50-year-old. One day her shop changes and she begins to study web marketing, how to ship a pack, how to write content for an online website. The journey changes and you see with your eyes that\u2019s the only way to save your business, so you start to study again like a child. Open mind is the only [thing that] can save you.\u201d\n\nWe heard a similar story in many nominations. A son or a granddaughter had joined a family business and thrust it into the 21st century. One example was Asti Technologies in northern Spain \u2014 Ver\u00f3nica Pascual had turned her family engineering company into a pioneer of Industry 4.0.\n\nWe heard a similar story in many nominations. A son or a granddaughter had joined a family business and thrust it into the 21st century.\n\nIt is impossible to compare these enterprises directly with Europe\u2019s largest industrial companies, such as Airbus and Spanish bank BBVA, both of which deploy sophisticated technology in product design. The final list is best regarded not as recognition of one quality but as a snapshot of how Europe\u2019s economy is evolving in various ways, aided by technology.\n\nThe costs of disruption \u2014 job losses and in some cases work casualisation \u2014 were a topic of keen debate when the judges gathered in Brussels. A prime example was Deliveroo, the UK delivery company valued at about $2bn. Although it was admired for its rapid growth, its treatment of drivers and riders as self-employed contractors for whom it takes limited responsibility was heavily criticised (Read about the judges\u2019 dilemma here).\n\nIn terms of training, many nominated projects focused on women and girls or on training refugees and migrants. There was less evidence of training or reskilling of older workers whose skills have dated because of technology. The judges hope to see a deeper response to a huge challenge in the future.\n\nEurope has a fair way to go to match the sense of opportunity and the availability of growth finance in the US. While Deliveroo and others, including Adyen, the Dutch payments company, have become European \u201cunicorns\u201d valued at more than $1bn, they are heavily outnumbered in Silicon Valley. European growth companies are still lured to the US to expand.\n\nChris Haley of Nesta has his say during the judging debate \u00a9 Sarah Van Looy\n\nBut the Road to Growth project uncovered a huge range and variety of activity from European companies and entrepreneurs. One of the key insights was how much is going on in industries that do not grab headlines as readily as consumer internet and social media groups. These ranged from health groups such as Cambridge Cancer Genomics in the UK to supply chain businesses such as Imperial Logistics in Germany.\n\nThere is plenty for Europe to be proud of, much of it involving cutting-edge technology applied in ways that are transforming industries. As well as accelerating its pace, the continent should shout a bit louder about what it is achieving. Those on the Road to Growth list are making themselves known."}, {"source": {"id": "financial-times", "name": "Financial Times"}, "author": null, "title": "Europe\u2019s 100 digital champions", "description": "The people and companies leading Europe\u2019s growth", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6d68a236-e153-11e8-8e70-5e22a430c1ad", "urlToImage": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F1826bdd6-e7ab-11e8-8a85-04b8afea6ea3?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T04:00:29Z", "content": "Leading individuals These men and women are helping to promote digital transformation in Europe as leaders and influencers, both behind the scenes and in the public eye Nenad Bakic Mathematician turned social entrepreneur, Nenad Bakic is trying to change the \u2026 [+42230 chars]", "fulltext": "Thank you for your help!\n\nWhat was mispronounced?

More than 1,400 schools and institutions regionally have taken part in the competition to build and program mBot by Makeblock, an educational robot kit for beginners.

Her previous start-ups include Moto Mundo, a company that organises motorcycle tours in countries such as Cuba, Mongolia, Chile and Vietnam. In 2013 she founded Clue out of frustration at a lack of fertility-tracking technologies.\n\nClue is a free app that helps women track their menstrual cycle. Users enter data about their periods, pain, mood, fluids and sexual activity to create a personal data set. Clue recognises an individual\u2019s pattern, predicts their cycle and flags up anything that looks out of place. Anonymised data from the app is also shared with carefully selected health researchers.\n\nTin quickly discovered that pitching a product that focuses on inputs such as menstruation and breast tenderness to a roomful of mostly male investors was not easy.\n\n\u00a9 Jens Gyarmaty\n\n\u201cIt took a lot of energy,\u201d she says. After months of touring London, New York, Berlin and Silicon Valley, however, she and co-founder Hans Raffauf raised \u20ac50,000 from angel investors. \u201cIt was crucial to have Hans there translating the idea in his way, because it was almost 100 per cent men we spoke to,\u201d she says. \u201cWe made sure they could relate to its data and business model, but also its potential impact across their own lives through their wives or daughters.\u201d\n\nAfter a further $20m of investment, the Berlin-based app now has 10m users across 190 countries. Tin leads its 45-person team. \u201cWe are at the beginning of discovering what data can really do,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is completely changing and evolving. We are just learning how it can be used in an ethical, helpful and secure way.\u201d\n\nTin is now aiming for Clue to be the number one female health app in the world. \u201cI believe in future we will have female technology to help us read exactly what is going on inside our bodies. We can own it and have more control to live our best lives,\u201d she says. \u201cAll women worldwide who have a phone can benefit from technology that helps them understand female health.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Miller Van Dyck\n\nAn American by birth but a Belgian resident for 20 years, Cheryl Miller Van Dyck founded the Brussels-based Digital Leadership Institute to help more women reach top roles in the technology sector.\n\nThe non-profit organisation provides training in technology and leadership skills for girls as well as career-age women, encouraging them to become entrepreneurs and innovators.\n\nSaskia Vanderstichele\n\nThe institute also organises events for women interested in becoming entrepreneurs, and runs Digital Brusselles, Europe\u2019s first female tech incubator.

The company had already created automated vehicles to help its customers move goods around factories and warehouses, but Pascual began to develop these further.\n\nAsti became a European leader in making automated guided vehicles \u2014 robots that can ferry goods around industrial facilities. Asti\u2019s driverless forklifts and trailers can move everything from single crates and pallets to loads of several tonnes, guided by magnets, lasers and sensors.\n\nAsti became a European leader in making automated guided vehicles\n\nIn 2008, Pascual acquired all of Asti\u2019s shares and started a process of internationalising the business, signing deals with multinationals in the wiring, food and automotive sectors and opening an international sales office in Buenos Aires. The company now operates in 16 countries and since 2011 more than half of its profits have come from international sales.\n\nIt employs more than 230 people, including a large research department. Asti works with universities and research centres, such as Germany\u2019s Fraunhofer institute and Spain\u2019s Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology. Asti\u2019s Talent and Technology Foundation runs training for the company\u2019s staff and programmes to engage young people in technology and science.\n\nLa Bottega del Calzolaio\n\nDate founded: 1916\n\nCountry: Italy\n\nIn 1916, Luca Del Vecchio opened a shoe repair shop in a small town near Salerno, southern Italy. Nearly a century later, his great-great nephews started using online marketplaces to sell their handmade leather shoes and accessories. This revolutionised La Bottega del Calzolaio\u2019s productivity at a time when the country\u2019s independent businesses were struggling to stay afloat.\n\nOrazio Del Vecchio (pictured) and his brother (also named Luca) grew up playing with leather in the family shop and became the fourth generation to take over the family business. In 2013, they set up an eBay store and increased turnover by 400 per cent in three years. The online transition was \u201can intuitive move to keep up with times\u201d, says Orazio.\n\nThe online transition was 'an intuitive move to keep up with times', says Orazio \u00a9 Antonio Volpe\n\nDigitalisation not only boosted the brand\u2019s artisanal reputation but helped to market the \u201cMade In Italy\u201d products overseas. La Bottega del Calzolaio\u2019s own website has been operating since 2016, offering twice as many products as are available on the bricks-and-mortar store shelves. \u201cIt\u2019s an ancient profession, but it can be digitised and innovated, and it\u2019s far from disappearing,\u201d says Luca.\n\nToday, the 10-strong online team works across different areas from digital management, shipping and customer care to graphic design and content. Luca and Orazio still place great importance on communicating with customers, but now use technology to do so, harnessing social networks and digital channels. They also plan to open international stores.\n\nMycujoo\n\nDate founded: 2014\n\nCountry: Switzerland\n\nWelcome to the world of democratised football. On Mycujoo, any club, league or federation, however small, can broadcast their games to a worldwide audience. The online platform not only streams live matches in 100 countries across six continents but is expanding into other major sports.\n\nFor years, Pedro Presa \u2014 a lifelong fan of Portuguese football club, Boavista \u2014 struggled to find television coverage of third division matches. Top premier leagues took up most network space, leaving minor divisions, amateur leagues and women\u2019s football with next to no air time. After doing a masters in sports management and law, he teamed up in 2014 with his brother, Jo\u00e3o, an engineer in the oil and gas industry, and founded Mycujoo.\n\n'Our platform is 100 per cent dedicated to football and our technology allows us to do this in a user-generated environment,' says Jo\u00e3o (pictured in the black shirt with Pedro)\n\n\u201cOur platform is 100 per cent dedicated to football and our technology allows us to do this in a user-generated environment,\u201d says Jo\u00e3o. For now, Mycujoo does not produce any content itself but provides a platform for 120 federations.\n\nPartnerships with federations such as the Asian Football Confederation and Uefa in Europe have accelerated the platform\u2019s growth, and the pair expect to have streamed 20,000 live matches in 2018 alone, up from 4,200 in 2017.\n\n\u201cThis is just an evolution of what is happening in other industries like Spotify with music,\u201d says Pedro. \u201cWe\u2019re connecting directly with the consumer to build a very democratic environment, enabling the same to everyone, regardless of location, conditions or financial capacity. Together with the network providers, we can build a far-reaching global community from the Pacific islands to the Himalayas.\u201d\n\nThe studio team in Zurich provide AI and metadata tools for their partners to add tags to their content, making match highlights easier to find and follow. \u201cEvery moment is connected to our Fifa standard unique ID database system, so every tag refers to a country, competition, club, team and even player involved in the moment,\u201d says Pedro. If a footballer gets a yellow card or scores a goal, it is automatically collected into a lifetime passport of their player history.\n\nNext year, Mycujoo is expanding beyond football, and is soon expected to annouce a new partnership with a leading sports federation. \u201cWith the platform and tagging technology, we are on the way to becoming the biggest football community and sport network in the world,\u201d says Jo\u00e3o.\n\nCorporate digital transformations \u2022 Airbus\n\nDate founded: 1970\n\nCountry: France\n\nThe aerospace and defence group began a digital transformation programme in 2017, including expanding into quantum computing and data-driven services. \u2022 BBVA\n\nDate founded: 1857\n\nCountry: Spain\n\nThe banking group has reduced operating expenses and seen huge growth in its digital customer base after investing in big data, artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing and blockchain projects. \u2022 Botta\n\nDate founded: 1947\n\nCountry: Italy\n\nThe company is a family-owned producer of cardboard packaging, making use of robotic process automation and chatbots to streamline its business. \u2022 British Council\n\nDate founded: 1934\n\nCountry: UK\n\nBritain\u2019s international organisation for cultural relations and educational opportunities has several digital initiatives, including an AI-driven English speaking app to keep up with learning demand in China. \u2022 Di Sciascio\n\nDate founded: 2011\n\nCountry: Italy\n\nRevenue at this family-run construction consultancy rose rapidly after the business adopted digital technologies such as BIM automation and software development. \u2022 Enel\n\nDate founded: 1962\n\nCountry: Italy\n\nThe electricity provider plans to spend \u20ac4.7bn by 2020 digitalising its electricity grid and retrofitting existing power plants with new technologies such as drones, robotic process automation and machine learning. \u2022 FarmaRegno\n\nDate founded: 2006\n\nCountry: Italy\n\nAfter taking over the pharmacy her grandfather started in 2006, Tiziana Regno turned it into an online marketplace and country-wide chain.

The start-up runs an online trading platform on which people can buy and trade shares in works of art.\n\nInvestors can buy as little as 0.1 per cent of an artwork and then make a profit when the artwork is resold. Alternatively, shareholders can sell or exchange their shares with other users on the platform. A dashboard allows investors to track the value of their investments.\n\nArtworks on the site can be priced anywhere between \u00a33,000 and \u00a350,000. Feral Horses offers the works for rent to businesses and hotels for fees of 1-2 per cent to increase visibility and to generate dividends of up to 11 per cent for the works\u2019 co-owners.\n\n'Habemous Hominem' by Jago\n\nArtists make money when they sell their works to the platform. They can also retain shares in their work, allowing them to benefit if the artwork rises in value over time. Artists are selected in collaboration with art advisers and art fairs, focusing on contemporary works, including paintings, photographs and sculptures.\n\nFeral Horses takes a commission of 10-20 per cent on sales \u2014 in an industry where dealers take an average of 50 per cent. The London-based company handles the logistics for the works, managing storage, insurance and transportation.\n\nThe platform has more than 1,900 registered users, of whom 165 have invested in a piece. So far it has had around 25 artworks for sale by 13 artists, including \u201cHabemous Hominem\u201d by Jago.\n\n\u2022 UiPath\n\nDate founded: 2005\n\nCountry: Romania (HQ: New York, US)\n\nUiPath is trying to decrease the number of mundane admin tasks \u2014 such as filling in forms and invoicing \u2014 that office staff have to perform. The software company, founded in 2005 in Bucharest by Romanian entrepreneur Daniel Dines and Marius Tirca, creates robots which are deployed in company computer systems to emulate and execute repetitive processes like these.\n\nThis can save time and money. One European human resources company was able to automate 90 per cent of its sick leave certificate processing. It handled some 2,500 of these per month. Within six months of using the automation software, error rates fell to zero, manual effort was reduced to 5 per cent and processing time was cut by 80 per cent.\n\nUiPath is trying to decrease the number of mundane admin tasks\n\nToday, more than 1,500 companies and government agencies worldwide use UiPath\u2019s tools. In April 2017, the company launched an academy for training in the use of robotic process automation. So far, more than 100,000 people worldwide have enrolled on at least one online course.\n\nMost of UiPath\u2019s robots are so-called attended robots, which respond to direct commands from humans \u2014 for example, through email. Often these operate through amusing security words such as \u201cdarling\u201d or \u201csweetie\u201d and will not execute requests without these triggers. Robots in a marketing company, for instance, would respond to emails that read: \u201cDarling, please update the banners for the campaign\u201d or \u201cSweetie, please give me funding stats\u201d.The next step will be unattended robots that operate without human commands.\n\n\u2022 Starship Technologies\n\nDate founded: 2014\n\nCountry: Estonia\n\nThe company\u2019s founders, Ahti Heinla and Janus Friis, were part of the original development team that created video-call company Skype. Not content with disrupting the telecoms industry they have turned their attention to the delivery sector and created self-driving robots that can transport packages.\n\nThe six-wheeled bots are designed to move along pavements at a pedestrian speed and navigate around people and objects using GPS, ultrasonic sensors, radar and cameras. Those awaiting a package can monitor the robot\u2019s journey on a smartphone. The cargo hold is locked and can only be opened by the recipient.\n\nThe six-wheeled bots are designed to move along pavements at a pedestrian speed\n\nThe first prototype was created in Tallinn, Estonia, in 2014 and although Starship has moved its headquarters to San Francisco, development of the robots is still based in the Baltic country. Trials of the autonomous robots have so far run in more than 100 cities in 20 countries. They are in use, on a small scale, at academic and corporate campuses in San Francisco, Arkansas, Hamburg, Tallinn and Milton Keynes.\n\nStarship\u2019s robots can deliver food, groceries and online shopping in a 3km radius, at a much lower cost than traditional delivery services. The low-emission bots are more eco-friendly as well, the company says.\n\nTo date the company, which employs some 200 people, has raised a total of $42.2m in funding in two rounds, with the latest $25m cash injection coming from a seed round in June.\n\nNew technologies and business models \u2022 3D Hubs\n\nDate founded: 2013\n\nCountry: Netherlands\n\nConnects people to the nearest 3D printers available, shortening printing lead times. \u2022 ABB\n\nDate founded: 1988\n\nCountry: Switzerland\n\nProvides robotics, artificial intelligence (AI) and data to digitalise costly and dangerous tasks such as offshore oil platform work. \u2022 AutoStore\n\nDate founded: 1995\n\nCountry: Norway\n\nUses robots to maximise storage space in warehouses. \u2022 Babylon Health\n\nDate founded: 2013\n\nCountry: UK\n\nMatches patients to doctors and other health professionals via a video call app. \u2022 Booking.com\n\nDate founded: 1996\n\nCountry: Netherlands\n\nThe online travel booking company\u2019s customers reserve more than 1.5m rooms a night in 229 countries. \u2022 Brainly\n\nDate founded: 2009\n\nCountry: Poland\n\nA crowdsourced social learning platform that allows middle and high school students to share homework help.

It can involve simply showing a neighbour how to log on to the internet, but extends to courses, lectures and workshops.\n\nOne of the aims is to alleviate the \u201cdigital divide\u201d between different social groups, and so volunteers focus on reaching communities most at risk of digital exclusion. It works with over 500 grassroots charity associations supporting the elderly, migrants, people with mental health difficulties and the unemployed.\n\nFundacion Cibervoluntarios is a network of more than 1500 volunteers in Spain who help others learn digital skills\n\nIn March this year, together with the Mujeres Foundation, Cibervoluntarios launched an initiative to train 5000 women in rural Spain to help them improve their digital literacy and employment prospects.

He wrote twice to ShamalStart, an organisation that provides start-up funding with a proposal. Both times he was rejected because they were so poorly written.\n\nBecoming an entrepreneur was tough, he says. People kept saying, \u201cyou\u2019re Syrian. You can\u2019t start a business. You can\u2019t because you\u2019re a refugee.\u201d Then Kahwati enrolled to study the internet of things through Kiron Open Higher Education, a digital learning platform for refugees. After taking a proposal writing course, Kahwati was also accepted by ShamalStart to receive funding for his tech start-up, Drag IoT.\n\nSince 2015, Kiron has been providing access to higher education for refugees around the world. Students can access courses and track their learning progress on the platform. The \u201cKiron Campus\u201d caters to students from very diverse backgrounds and varying language skills.\n\nSince 2015, Kiron has been providing access to higher education for refugees around the world \u00a9 Ana Santl\n\nCo-founders Vincent Zimmer and Marcus Kressler started with a vision of creating \u201cuniversity 2.0\u201d where education could be individually tailored for each student, including refugees. \u201cUsually [people] see university from a perspective of classrooms and buildings, and from there begin to think about how to proceed to modernise in the 21st century,\u201d says Tobias Ernst, Kiron\u2019s chief executive.\n\n\u201cWe are the opposite. We see higher education from an entirely different perspective. We offer blended learning approaches, bringing people together mainly through digital platforms.\u201d\n\nToday, more than 3,500 students have enrolled on the platform which has teamed up with 56 universities worldwide. \u201cWe want to grow significantly in the upcoming months.\u201d Ernst says. \u201cEverything we wanted to put in place now works, so from here we plan to significantly upscale the numbers by the end of 2019.\u201d\n\nKiron\u2019s approach comes amid a general push by universities to offer more courses online. \u201cWe are already contributing to a systemic shift towards digital education,\u201d Kressler says. \u201cGermany is opening up to this tech education, and now we want to further advance sustainable development in education on a global scale.\u201d\n\nOne disadvantage is lack of the personal contact students would get in a traditional classroom, Ernst says. To address this, Kiron has built a student forum. He says: \u201cIt\u2019s not only about education and open access. Our students are future leaders and changemakers so it is very important to get them together.

Since then, numerous free events have been organised around Finland and the concept has spread to hundreds of cities across the world, such as Belgrade, Buenos Aires, Manila and Tel Aviv.\n\nRails Girls is a completely distributed movement \u2014 anyone can launch their own 12-hour free workshops \u00a9 Alex Growd\n\nRails Girls is a completely distributed movement \u2014 anyone can launch their own 12-hour free workshops in their hometown and organise events with local sponsors.\n\nIn 2013 Rails Girls went on to inspire an award-winning worldwide fellowship programme for women and non-binary coders called Rails Girls Summer of Code. The programme is aimed at advanced beginners who would like to pursue a career in full-time programming.\n\nSuccessful applicants receive three-month scholarships from July to September to work on open source project at a company, supported by a tutor.

The online platform facilitates digital discussion on everything from transportation, education, international security and biodiversity.\n\nA chatbot on the site can answer users\u2019 simpler questions, while machine-learning algorithms monitor and analyse the content of discussions in order to get insights on citizens\u2019 concerns that can be passed on to government bodies.\n\nIf the discussion generates a potential solution to a problem this can be put to policymakers. When the system was tested in North Holland, for example, 10 online citizen contributions on how to improve biodiversity in the region were included in a white paper submitted to their national government.\n\nBerlin-based Civocracy encourages citizens to become more involved in government decisions\n\nThe platform can be used for public consultations, with founders claiming it makes such exercises twice as efficient in terms of man-hours and boosts participation by 300 per cent. A study Civocracy carried out with the French city of Lyon in 2016 showed that for every one citizen who attends a traditional town hall consultation, 74 follow a discussion on the Civocracy platform. For every citizen who stands up to speak at a town hall meeting, four would add a comment on Civocracy\u2019s online platform.\n\nGovernments and advisory services can take out a subscription that allows them to use Civocracy to gauge public opinion on policy changes.\n\nCivocracy operates in four European countries and has worked with over 25 different government departments in France, Belgium, Netherlands and Germany. Recent projects include helping to develop a 10-year infrastructure plan and unified identity for the territory of Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes as well as assisting Monheim am Rhein to gather citizen propositions for the town. The company is planning to expand to the US, UK and the Nordic markets.\n\n\u2022 Fab Lab Barcelona\n\nDate founded: 2007\n\nCountry: Spain\n\nImagine a future where only data moves around the world while physical materials stay put. Food, consumer goods and even cryptocurrencies would circle within city neighbourhoods using technology and 3D printing.\n\nFor five days, Fab Lab Barcelona put this concept in practice. In 2016, its team of hackers, artisans, designers and entrepreneurs transformed the Poblenou district into the world\u2019s first Fab City prototype, showing how material flows could be redesigned against a backdrop of climate change and depleting natural resources.\n\nSome 1,300 Fab Labs have already opened around the world since 2001, as small-scale workshops offering public access to digital fabrication. The Fab City initiative is an offshoot from the Fab Foundation, IAAC, MIT, and the Barcelona city council, looking to develop a global network of self-sufficient cities.\n\nTomas Diez: \u2018Cities can share innovations and technology to change destructive, passive consumer habits\u2019\n\n\u201cIn Barcelona, we are trying to take that principle to the city scale to pioneer the Fab City initiative,\u201d says Tomas Diez, who helped set up the Barcelona lab in 2007 and start the Poblenou project.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that you can have a manufacturer within local communities and dramatically reduce the energy used for transportation, whilst also recycling materials back into the production line.\u201d\n\nToday, 28 countries, regions and cities have pledged to become a self-sufficient Fab City by 2054.\n\nDiez says that \u201cunlike say, smart cities, it is not competitive but a collaborative effort, where cities can share information, innovations and technology to change destructive, passive consumer habits.\u201d\n\nDiez and the Barcelona team are now creating the Fab City Index to measure progress towards the 2054 goal. \u201cUnfortunately most cities right now do not measure their self-sufficiency,\u201d he says.\n\n\u2018\u2018The next challenge is to work on instruments or indicators \u2014 like reduced amounts of carbon emissions or waste \u2014 to measure and monitor a city\u2019s transformation progress.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Open Data Institute\n\nDate founded: 2012\n\nCountry: UK\n\nSir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web, and Sir Nigel Shadbolt, artificial intelligence expert, co-founded the Open Data Institute in 2012 because they wanted to open up government and corporate data to more people. The idea was that data could be used for both business opportunities and would allow citizens hold to companies and governments to account.\n\n\u201cWe have had an impact around the world, not only in governments but in the way that people think about the possibility of open data,\u201d says Sir Nigel. \u201cAn open data ecosystem is not just about ethics but can be immensely profitable as well.\u201d\n\nSir Tim Berners-Lee and Sir Nigel Shadbolt co-founded ODI because they wanted to open up government and corporate data to more people \u00a9 Paul Clarke\n\nIn order to persuade local governments and local businesses to run 21st century economies, there need to be more data stores that are open for all to use, he says. \u201cIt is about communication. It is about understanding data as a new kind of infrastructure.\u201d\n\nOne strand of work is persuading private companies to share more of their data with peers in their sector and with clients.\n\n\u201cCompanies can make data available to help them attract more customers, build relationships with their partners and make their organisation more trustworthy and sustainable,\u201d says Jeni Tennison, the ODI\u2019s chief executive.\n\nThe ODI also trains and educates people in modern data use. Learning how to store data, how to extract knowledge and how to then make decisions with that knowledge is crucial for governments, companies and individuals, Tennison says.\n\nThe ODI started with a five-year grant from the UK government, and soon added funding from corporations.

The town, whose population is less than 3,000, was transformed into a digital hub in 2\u2026 [+7277 chars]", "fulltext": "Skibbereen, a tiny town near the south coast of Ireland on the EU\u2019s western front, was one of the first places in the country to be connected to a gigabit broadband network. The town, whose population is less than 3,000, was transformed into a digital \u201chub\u201d in 2016 to bring faster connectivity to homes and businesses. Siro, a joint venture between UK telecoms company Vodafone and the Irish Electricity Supply Board, had kicked off a plan to light up 50 Irish towns with broadband speeds faster than those in most parts of London, never mind Dublin.\n\nSkibbereen has proved a success, with many people relocating from Dublin to take advantage of the faster speeds. Siro has now connected 185,000 homes across the country, but a wider plan for faster broadband in Ireland, which relied on EU funds via the European Investment Bank, has been thrown into doubt.\n\nA botched bidding process led to the exit this year of companies including Eir, the incumbent, and the consortium led by Vodafone. Energy company SSE also walked away from the Enet consortium, the only remaining bidder, as companies questioned the viability of the long-term plan. For the unlucky ones outside the original Siro footprint, there is still, therefore, a digital divide.\n\nThis kind of fragmented approach to fibre build has created a patchwork quilt of broadband networks, not just in Ireland but across the continent. Some rural areas that have received investment from telecoms companies enjoy ultrafast speeds, while nearby \u201csecond cities\u201d will be surfing via copper phone lines, rather than next-generation access (NGA) \u2014 or faster, upgraded networks \u2014 for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe connected economy, with fast internet connections for all, has been something the European Commission has gone to great lengths to extol. Eight years ago it set a target for every household in the EU to be able to access a 30Mbps broadband connection \u2014 labelled \u201csuperfast\u201d \u2014 by 2020. Superfast speeds enable multiple users in a household to use the internet at the same time \u2014 to download movies or stream music, say \u2014 with no service degradation.\n\nSome suggest telecom companies, rather than going it alone, should co-invest in new networks \u00a9 Getty\n\nAnother Commission target was that half of all citizens were expected to take up an ultrafast connection, broadly defined as a gigabit line like those in Skibbereen, by that date.\n\nYet this June, the European Court of Auditors called time on those targets. The body said that while there had been significant progress in delivering basic connections, the higher ambitions would be missed.\n\nThe number of homes that could connect to a standard internet connection across the EU actually fell in 2017, according to the latest industry data. The 0.2-percentage-point drop from 2016 was an anomaly as it reflected the fact that more houses were built than internet lines connected, but it nonetheless revealed the challenge that policymakers have to overcome to deliver the dream of universal coverage.\n\nRural areas were shown to be dragging down the push toward superfast speeds. Patchy speeds in the countryside meant only 14 of the 28 EU member states had surpassed 50 per cent superfast broadband coverage in Europe.\n\nThe EU\u2019s own report into the state of broadband highlighted that by 2016, huge swaths of rural France, Scotland, Greece, eastern Germany and Poland were still nowhere near hitting the 30Mbps standard. As for ultrafast coverage, only 15 per cent of homes in the bloc were paying for such a service by the middle of 2017.\n\nRural areas are not the only ones suffering from the digital divide. A Financial Times investigation published in July showed that some inner districts of Britain\u2019s biggest cities suffer terrible broadband speeds too. Politicians also love to remind people that Brussels, the administrative home of the EU, was one of the last places in Europe to get a 4G network.\n\nIliana Ivanova, the member of the European Court of Auditors responsible for the report, argued that a sense of realism was necessary in the digital sector. \u201cIt is important that the EU sets itself challenging and realistic targets for broadband in the future \u2014 and meets them,\u201d she said.\n\nThe auditor\u2019s report, which was based on visits to Ireland, Germany, Hungary, Poland and Italy, said broadband policies were inconsistent and not all the countries had the right legal and regulatory conditions in place to attract competition, a key driver for investment. Financing is also a key hurdle. The European Commission estimates \u20ac250bn is required to hit the 2020 targets it initially set. Half of this would be needed for rural areas.\n\nSome 95 per cent of Europe\u2019s broadband upgrade is expected to be funded by the private sector, but companies say the European Commission has missed opportunities to stimulate investment.\n\nThe Electronic Communications Code, legislation passed this year but still being drawn up for implementation, was initially welcomed by the telecoms sector. To encourage spending on fibre and 5G networks it looked initially to ease regulations on telecoms companies, but later new onerous regulatory measures, such as a crackdown on telecoms \u201coligopolies\u201d and new caps on international calling tariffs, were added, damping the code\u2019s impact.\n\nSome funding mechanisms are available, including the Connecting Europe Facility, a \u20ac24bn fund for investments in transport, energy and digital infrastructure, but telecoms companies say those are not being fully used. According to multiple sources in the telecoms industry, this is because it is difficult to convince shareholders to invest in rural areas where the payback is uncertain, even with the stimulus.\n\nIt is important the EU sets realistic targets for broadband \u2014 and meets them\n\nFunders have been willing to come into some markets, such as Italy and the UK, where the incumbent telecoms companies have been slow to invest in full fibre. That is the result of both political support and regulatory moves to champion smaller players, or altnets, by loosening rules to encourage investment.\n\nOthers argue that a different model is needed. Joao Sousa, head of the infrastructure and technology practice at telecoms consultancy Delta Partners, says governments should move away from using public subsidies in rural areas and instead encourage carriers to buy capacity from a single \u201cnetco\u201d to ensure it is viable.\n\nCo-investment in new networks can be a way for competing networks to reduce costs and ensure investments are viable in sparsely populated areas. The notion of a single netco \u2014 a designated supplier that would have a monopoly in a certain area but with strict wholesale requirements \u2014 has become a talking point in the sector.\n\n\u201cRegulators need to promote network sharing and release the 20MHz-30MHz low band of spectrum to increase coverage and speeds if rural broadband is to become anything close to a reality,\u201d said Sousa. \u201cNetwork sharing and low band spectrum availability are key to making rural broadband a reality.\u201d\n\nTelecoms companies and their investors remain wary of committing to full fibre in many of Europe\u2019s biggest countries. With the European Commission preparing its political agenda for 2019, there is a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Policymakers still have to decide if they want European telecoms champions capable of investing rapidly in new networks or whether they should prioritise low consumer prices and competitive markets. In a year of transition for Europe, the onus could be back on local regulators and politicians to work it out."}, {"source": {"id": "financial-times", "name": "Financial Times"}, "author": null, "title": "Procurement comes out of the shadows", "description": "The advent of digital tools has put the back office at the forefront of business strategy", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3a0da70e-ad52-11e8-8253-48106866cd8a", "urlToImage": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fee973ddc-e17f-11e8-a6e5-792428919cee?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T04:00:29Z", "content": "When Christian Holzer joined ThyssenKrupp as chief procurement officer in 2012, he knew he faced a big challenge.

Shortly before he joined, the German steel conglomerate, whose history went back hundreds of years, had nearly gone bankrupt. Holzer was tasked with the seemingly paradoxical goals of cutting costs while maintaining innovation and good relations with the unions.\n\nProcurement departments are an unlikely place to start a revolution. If anything, they have a reputation for being humdrum places, graveyards for underperforming employees. In the consumer world, buying is exciting: people flock to flashy malls, peruse high-street shops, or buy online with a single click; innovation is rife. But for industrial goods, procurement has often been seen more as a drain on a company\u2019s resources than as a strategic driver.\n\n\u201cIn the past, people were moved to procurement so they couldn\u2019t do harm any more,\u201d Holzer says. \u201cThere was a complete mismatch between people\u2019s responsibility and capability \u2014 they were just the wrong people in charge of this great expense.\u201d\n\nHal Watts is chief executive of Unmade, a software company in the fashion industry. \u201cIt\u2019s this shitty job where every conversation you had over the past 50 years was phoning suppliers and saying, \u2018Make it cheaper\u2019,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the past decade, however, a radical shift has taken place as companies such as ThyssenKrupp have deployed digital tools to make procurement a central driver, not only to cut costs and ethically source supplies, but to simplify operations and, in some cases, find new sources of revenue.\n\nA ThyssenKrupp grinder used in cement production \u00a9 Uwe Anspach\n\nHolzer says it took five years to overcome resistance, restaff his team and embrace digitalisation. The group now works directly with suppliers on innovation and contributes to design. \u201cThis is a different approach. We\u2019re able to change the design with our colleagues from engineering,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery euro of our spend is a value contribution. That is our mindset.\u201d\n\nAlex Saric, chief marketing officer at Ivalua, a platform for digitalising procurement, says technology has changed the very definition of procurement from \u201cbuying goods and services\u201d to \u201cdriving value\u201d. The process starts by going digital, so new suppliers can be found and contracts can be managed with automation tools. Once goods and contracts can be seen in real time by everyone across the organisation, it is possible to take better decisions. \u201cTen years ago the primary function [for procurement teams] was beating up suppliers to get the lowest possible price. No one much appreciated it. People cared about costs but didn\u2019t view it as strategic. That has changed massively,\u201d says Saric.\n\nSkilled procurement teams can reduce a company\u2019s purchasing cost base by 8-12 per cent \u2014 enough for big companies to save billions of euros \u2014 but \u201cmost companies\u201d only scratch the surface, says Klaus Neuhaus, a partner at Bain, the management consultancy. He believes procurement is now \u201cthe biggest lever\u201d companies have for optimising costs.\n\nTesting lift technology at a ThyssenKrupp facility in Germany \u00a9 Bloomberg\n\nIndustrial goods companies spend on average nearly half of their revenue on raw materials, components and other supplies. At ThyssenKrupp the figure is 65 per cent, or about \u20ac25bn a year. But most companies tend to prioritise marketing and sales \u2014 the big contributor to the top line \u2014 and spend less time streamlining procurement. \u201cFor classic goods companies, sales is an obvious thing to do,\u201d Neuhaus adds. \u201cIt\u2019s respected. It\u2019s driving the growth of the company. In procurement, nobody really takes care of it. They are not as trained; they don\u2019t have the same incentives in place.\u201d\n\nCompanies such as SAP Ariba are trying to change this. Based in Palo Alto, the company has a typically Californian slogan: \u201cMake Procurement Awesome.\u201d The company may be little known among consumers, but more than 3.4m companies across 190 countries use the Ariba Network to process $2.1tn worth of transactions each year \u2014 more than Amazon, Alibaba and eBay combined. \u201cIt\u2019s this sleeping giant that no one has heard about,\u201d says Barry Padgett, president of SAP Ariba.\n\nAriba was purchased for $4.3bn by German software group SAP in 2012, back when it was processing $350bn in commerce. Its rapid growth since then \u2014 annual transactions have sextupled \u2014 reflects a boom in how digital tools are being deployed to manage complexity that humans relying on paper and spreadsheets cannot comprehend. Instead of making buying decisions just on price, companies can now look at everything from speed and capability to ethics.\n\nSAP executives Jim Hagemann Snabe, Hasso Plattner and Bill McDermott following the announcement of the purchase of Ariba in 2012 \u00a9 AFP/Getty Images\n\nSAP Ariba\u2019s goal, says Padgett, is to take the \u201cback-office, after-the-fact process\u201d of procurement and push it to the forefront of strategy. \u201cThe stuff that you buy, then assemble and sell, or the people that you contract with \u2014 who then perform services that you sell \u2014 is largely where the value comes in for your business,\u201d he says, adding that actively managing this makes sense.\n\nThe greater the complexity of a supply chain, the more digital tools help. Matthias Dohrn, senior vice-president of procurement controlling and governance at BASF, the German chemical company, uses Ariba and IBM\u2019s Watson artificial intelligence system to catalogue more than 80,000 suppliers, which he can then evaluate and hold accountable. If BASF wants to complete a project, it puts out an e-auction to let suppliers bid on it, potentially bringing in new partners and avoiding a complacent \u201cstickiness\u201d of dealing with the same base of suppliers.\n\n\u201cIn the past, a relationship might smooth over a miss,\u201d says Kevin Sterneckert, innovation strategist at JDA, a US software company employing machine learning across the supply chain. \u201cNow it\u2019s more based on performance. The one that thrives is the one that delivers.\u201d\n\nThe benefits go far beyond cost saving. Earlier this year Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the asset manager, told companies they needed to move beyond fiduciary duties and find a \u201csense of purpose\u201d to show they are helping the communities they live in.\n\nProcurement teams, Padgett says, can play a big role in making businesses more ethical because they can use filters to select only suppliers that are certified to use conflict-free materials or that promote social goals related to ethnicity, gender or LGBT principles. One company that understands the consequences of getting this wrong is Nike. In the 1990s, after pictures emerged of a child stitching the sportswear company\u2019s Swoosh logo on a pair of shoes, Nike founder Phil Knight acknowledged that the brand had become \u201csynonymous with slave wages\u201d.\n\n\u201cAsk any chief procurement officer, \u2018What keeps you up at night?\u2019. It\u2019s a Google alert about their supply chain,\u201d says Nick Lardner, commercial manager at banking group Westpac in New Zealand.\n\nAt Swiss chemicals group Clariant, digital tools allow strategic performance manager Natalie Cueni to score suppliers on dozens of key performance indicators. She can monitor them daily to make sure Clariant only works with financially stable companies that avoid child labour and push sustainable production. \u201cWe are centrally monitoring our whole spend,\u201d she says. \u201cThese are abilities, through digitalisation, that we didn\u2019t have three years ago.\u201d\n\nAsk any CPO, \u201cWhat keeps you up at night?\u201d. It\u2019s a Google alert about their supply chain\n\nRichard Bistrong, an anti-bribery and compliance consultant, says these tools also play a role in clamping down on fraud, because each transaction leaves a digital footprint. \u201cThe more manual paperwork there is going into the system, the more opportunities there are for individuals to conspire with suppliers and circumvent controls, because no one can look holistically at the data,\u201d he says. With digitalisation, \u201cthere are more opportunities for people to flag anomalies\u201d.\n\nFor ThyssenKrupp, which has been struggling for eight years to restructure itself, procurement has been an unsung hero. With SAP Ariba it created Pronet, a digital platform for handling its large but piecemeal spending function, resulting in more efficient operations, a lower carbon footprint and substantial cost reduction, even as its employee base has grown. Since 2012, the group has saved more than \u20ac5bn in fixed costs, exceeding its targets.\n\nHalf of those savings came from procurement, says Guido Kerkhoff, ThyssenKrupp\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWhen I joined [in 2012], we didn\u2019t even know how much we [purchased], for example, from Siemens. We now have that [information], and have more digitalised and automated [procurement], and we can better control it.\u201d\n\nStill, industry commentators say procurement continues to be underappreciated. They complain that MBA graduates typically know next to nothing about the field, and that procurement teams are still staffed by people who learnt on the job rather than trained for it.\n\nIvalua\u2019s Saric predicts significant change but says it could be five to 10 years before procurement sheds its dull image. \u201cWhen you\u2019re really going to see this accelerate is when some of the best chief procurement officers start becoming chief executives,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are really well suited for many top jobs, but we haven\u2019t seen that happen yet. We lack those success stories. But I think it\u2019s coming.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "financial-times", "name": "Financial Times"}, "author": null, "title": "Luxury goods companies mix craft and tech", "description": "Across Europe, artisan-based businesses are asking themselves whether digital production is friend or foe", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/706c6cf0-ad56-11e8-8253-48106866cd8a", "urlToImage": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F327a23fc-e176-11e8-a6e5-792428919cee?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T04:00:29Z", "content": "There is a factory in Venice on the Grand Canal where it seems time stopped still two centuries ago.

Workers at Tessitura Luigi Bevilacqua make damask and jacquard fabrics on 18th-century looms. Inside the faded palazzo the sound of the canal waters lapping outside the front door alternates with that of the clanking wooden looms inside.\n\n\u201cYou do not get the same effect if you use mechanical looms,\u201d says Alberto Bevilacqua as he watches two younger female colleagues heave themselves forward to push the wooden beams back and forth. The weave is deeper and richer as a result of the hand process, he argues.\n\nThe commitment of the Bevilacqua family and their seven weavers to the two-centuries-old jacquard process has its part in a roiling debate about the future of European craft in the face of new technologies. Alberto Bevilacqua, the company\u2019s chief executive, whose family dates its occupation in textiles to 1499, is on one side of the argument. His embrace of innovation ended with Jacquard\u2019s loom, a mould-busting invention in its day, awarded a patent in 1805 by Emperor Napoleon for its punch-card mechanism.\n\nOn the other side, European craft manufacturers, from makers of luxury handbags and eyewear to those of high-end furniture and even supercars, are embracing the future. They are exploring how much frontier technology, such as 3D printing, robots and artificial intelligence (AI), they can mix with their craft and still maintain their prestigious and lucrative \u201cMade in Europe\u201d reputation.\n\n\u201cThe greatest dilemma faced by the modern artisan craftsman is the machine,\u201d argued Richard Sennett in his influential 2009 book The Craftsman. \u201cIs it a friendly tool or an enemy replacing work of the human hand?\u201d\n\nAlberto Bevilacqua \u00a9 Paolo Bona\n\nOne business attempting to answer that question is the Th\u00e9lios eyewear factory opened in Italy last year. The plant, a joint venture between French luxury goods group LVMH and Italian eyewear manufacturer Marcolin, is in the Valle de Valjont, a cluster of artisanal eyewear workshops in the shadow of the Dolomite mountains.\n\nIn a gleaming white room, technical designers working on Mac computers turn a pencil sketch of sunglasses by Celine designer Hedi Slimane in Paris into precise technical drawings. These are then sent to 3D printers. In an adjacent room, artisans take over, hand-buffing prototypes to a high shine. Giovanni Zoppas, Th\u00e9lios chief executive, explains that by using 3D printers it now takes less than two hours to turn a designer\u2019s drawing into a physical product.\n\nThere is a similar scene at Gucci\u2019s new factory in Scandicci, an industrial zone west of Florence known for its artisanship since the Renaissance. In one room a robot makes $650 training shoes. The patented machine, dubbed Reingenious, manipulates and assembles the footwear. It saves human workers \u201chandling and stress\u201d, a Gucci guide says during a tour of the site.\n\nIn the next room, though, are artisans bending Gucci\u2019s signature bamboo handles by hand over a naked flame and hand-painting designs of birds and bees on handbags created by chief designer Alessandro Michele. Gucci, owned by France\u2019s Kering group, reckons only 30-35 per cent of its production can be completely automated \u2014 the rest needs some human input.\n\nGucci chief executive Marco Bizzarri is alive to tech threats, however. He recently told reporters that \u201c3D technology would be a big change in development and prototyping, and even production\u201d. He is also keeping an eye on \u201cin vitro\u201d growth of leathers (laboratory-produced material), a development that would eradicate the need for tanneries.\n\nHandcraftsmanship will always be an important reason why people pay outsized amounts to own or access luxury goods, argues Robert Wolcott, clinical professor of innovation and entrepreneurship in executive education at Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, near Chicago.\n\nA materials store \u00a9 Paolo Bona\n\nIt is wrong, however, to imagine all luxury goods will be produced in this manner in the future, he says. Consumers will probably continue to prize handmade products, he adds, while also valuing exceptional, exciting, provocative goods and experiences created by new means, from robots and 3D printers to AI-based systems. These modes are not mutually exclusive: some of the leading offerings will probably combine both traditional and new modes of production, Wolcott says.\n\n\u201cThe key point isn\u2019t necessarily that a luxury good is handmade, but that it is special or distinctive in some way that is significant to affluent consumers. Craftsmanship is one essential path, but it\u2019s not by any means the only one,\u201d he adds.\n\nMany agree. \u201cFor a tradition to be kept alive it needs to be constantly reinvented,\u201d says Olivier Brault, director-general of the Paris-based Fondation Bettencourt Schuler, the charitable organisation of the billionaire family behind French cosmetics group L\u2019Or\u00e9al.\n\nIf we do not work together more closely, we are at risk of losing the richness of Europe\n\nBut others remain wary of encroaching technology. Johann Rupert, chairman of Swiss luxury goods group Richemont, owner of Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, argues that European craft needs to be defended to \u201cmake sure Europe remains a workshop for the world\u201d. He does not want a dystopian vision of AI and robots to finish off European artisanship, which has already been decimated by globalisation and competition from China.\n\nThrough his charitable foundation, Rupert staged an exhibition in September at Venice\u2019s lush Giorgio Cini Foundation titled \u201cHomo Faber: Crafting a More Human Future\u201d, referring to the Renaissance aspiration of \u201cman as maker\u201d. It provided an overview of European fine craftsmanship \u2014 from Portuguese lacemakers to Slovak carpentry \u2014 and emphasised \u201cwhat human beings can do better than machines\u201d, says Rupert. \u201cI have been worried for quite a while about the loss of artisanal skills,\u201d he told the FT last month. The exhibition had been such a \u201creal success\u201d it would be staged again in two years, he said.\n\nStill, Wolcott notes that when Henry Ford started producing cars on assembly lines with interchangeable parts, many carmakers and commentators asserted that only the mass market would be served by such lower-quality products. \u201cToday, we still have a few handmade vehicles at the highest end of the market, such as Rolls-Royce, but no one would call a Mercedes S-Class an entry-level vehicle,\u201d he adds.\n\nYarn reels \u00a9 Paolo Bona\n\nThat is certainly the view at Pirelli, the Italian tyremaker that supplies high-end carmakers such as Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati and Porsche, as well as all Formula One racing teams. Marco Tronchetti Provera, Pirelli\u2019s chief executive, argues against taking a \u201cdefensive approach\u201d to technology as it would \u201cmean we have already lost the battle\u201d. \u201cWe need a proactive approach based on memory and culture,\u201d he said in a recent interview.\n\nPirelli\u2019s flagship plant outside Turin in northern Italy puts this vision into practice. Joining together two previously separate factories, it is arranged on two sides of a spine of offices, cafeteria and football pitch, and was designed by Renzo Piano. Cherry trees line the entrances. On the factory floor, engineers and production staff work side by side with robots. Machines mix the rubber, squeezing it into strips, before these are assembled part by humans and part by machine. No product leaves the factory floor without being inspected by an engineer.\n\nHigh technology will improve craft. It gives the human time to produce strategy and planning. So we have time to create\n\nThe most sophisticated production, however, is kept behind locked doors. Inside, 48 red robots, each two metres high and animated by AI, make Pirelli\u2019s top-of-class tyres for supercars, doing away with the need for a production line. The tyres are made on a product by product basis: a Ferrari tyre, then a Maserati tyre, then a Lamborghini tyre.\n\nTo celebrate the opening of the factory, Tronchetti Provera commissioned a piece of music to symbolise the fusion of the creativity of Pirelli\u2019s engineers with the machine intelligence and skill of workers on the shop floor. \u201cIl Canto della Fabbrica\u201d was performed on the factory floor as the robots whirred.\n\n\u201cThe richness of Europe is really something we have forgotten,\u201d Tronchetti Provera argues. \u201cWe are the richest region in the world, the manufacturing is the best in the world, we are the most creative, we are the most protected, but if we do not work together more closely, we are at risk of losing it.\n\n\u201cObviously China invests in AI as a country. You cannot invest in AI as France, Italy, Germany individually. Europe needs to invest as a region, together.\u201d\n\nOn the south-western edge of Europe, in the Portuguese coastal city of Porto, there is an indication of how technology could take European craft into the future.\n\nIn a low stone building dating from the 18th century, Paula Sousa, founder of Urbanmint and one of Portugal\u2019s rising design stars, has her studios. The space may date from the same period as Bevilacqua\u2019s looms, but there the comparison ends: Sousa is happy to use new technology to disrupt her craft. She is in good company. Nearby are the Porto offices of Farfetch, a London-based online luxury fashion company and one of Europe\u2019s most successful new technology companies.\n\nPaula Sousa at her metalwork supplier in Porto \u00a9 Attilio Fiumarella\n\n\u201cHigh technology will improve craft. It gives the human time to produce strategy and planning. So we have time to create and to think more wisely,\u201d says Sousa, flashing a wide smile. She created her two brands, Munna and Ginger & Jagger, during Portugal\u2019s crisis a decade ago when thousands of businesses were going to the wall. A former interior designer, she knew factories in China and Turkey could produce her sofas, mirrors and tables more cheaply but that they did not have the quality of Portuguese craftsmanship.\n\nShe took a gamble and went to visit Portuguese industrial jewellery-makers and marble-cutters that were idling or shuttering their business and asked them if, instead, they would consider turning their hand to custom-made furniture. \u201cI said: it is like jewellery but big,\u201d she says, throwing her arms wide as she remembers how she convinced one factory owner. That factory has retooled its metalworking machines, previously rendered redundant by competition from Indian jewellery factories, to make metre-wide gilt mirrors as delicate as rose stems. Each one is finished by hand. Dior, owned by LVMH, has ordered several for its stores.\n\nRiluc\u2019s factory in Porto \u00a9 Attilio Fiumarella\n\nAnother example in Porto is Riluc, a manufacturer of stainless steel which, when business dried up a decade ago, reinvented itself as a maker of high-end furniture. Factory owner Ricardo Lucas invited a French designer, Toni Grilo, to imagine new uses for his stainless steel: Riluc\u2019s Bibendum chair sells for \u20ac14,000.\n\n\u201cIn moments of crisis you start from the ground. Institutions do not solve these problems. It comes from ferment on the ground \u2014 you feel that ferment in Portugal,\u201d says Maria Milano, an architect and professor at Porto\u2019s ESAD school of art and design. New technologies mean there \u201cis more creativity than ever before\u201d in Europe, she adds. \u201cBefore the crisis, design was all about the centres, like Milan. In recent years designers have been able to be anywhere. They have 3D printing, so they can self-produce, and then they are able to sell via the internet.\u201d\n\nBrass parts in the Gondomar factory \u00a9 Attilio Fiumarella\n\nSousa can see a similar process of evolution at a marble-cutting yard in the green hills above Porto. Computer-controlled machines slice into marble on five axes at a time, creating her Rock table. The table is finished by hand, smoothed to a high shine.\n\nSousa recently returned from Toledo in Spain, where she met with master masons whose methods are unchanged from the 14th century. While this gave her some inspiration, it was not a solution for her.\n\n\u201cConsumers understand: why should an artisan be doing a mechanical process that can be done by a machine?\u201d says Sousa. Instead, she sees a fusion of designer, artisan and machine creating a new era for European craft. \u201cIt is a constellation in the end,\u201d she says. \u201cI am full of hope for the years to come.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "financial-times", "name": "Financial Times"}, "author": null, "title": "Companies take a \u2018grow your own\u2019 approach to digital talent", "description": "As technology disrupts their businesses, there is a scramble to boost workers\u2019 digital skills", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/88a3cb86-ad58-11e8-8253-48106866cd8a", "urlToImage": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F122f6414-e170-11e8-a6e5-792428919cee?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T04:00:29Z", "content": "Imagine it only took 40 seconds to buy lunch.

This is happening at some Marks and Spencer stores in London. The retailer has been rolling out a checkout-free service, initially in six stores. Shoppers use a phone app to scan and pay for items, then leave without queueing at the till.\n\nThe concept is part of a wide-ranging transformation plan by the UK retailer to future-proof its business. The idea is not new, Marks and Spencer is following the lead of ecommerce giant Amazon, which opened the world\u2019s first checkout-free supermarket this year in Seattle. Traditional companies such as Marks and Spencer, which traces its heritage back to a \u201cpenny bazaar\u201d stall in 1884, are under pressure to redesign their businesses to compete with new digital rivals.\n\nFinding staff with the technical knowhow for such a transformation can be difficult, especially as the European workforce ages and technology companies grab the best graduates with digital skills. Data from employment website Glassdoor, analysed by venture capital group Atomico, showed the median annual salary for software engineers in London was $54,800 in November last year. In Berlin the figure was $59,700. The pay offered by big tech companies was much higher, however, with Facebook offering average pay of $80,000 in London and Google\u2019s average UK salary at more than $76,000.\n\nSimmone Haywood, head of talent at Marks and Spencer, says this was a factor behind the retailer\u2019s decision to launch a retraining programme to teach staff about machine learning and coding languages such as R and Python. \u201cWe have a lot of data at M&S, but we have a lot more we can do to derive insights with that data,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a real understanding that the retail landscape is changing, so there is a desire to anticipate future needs. We recognised that reskilling workers was one of the main goals [for] becoming digital-first.\u201d\n\nSimmone Haywood of Marks and Spencer\n\nThe programme, which was launched this year, will put between 35 and 150 Marks and Spencer employees through 18 months of training with Decoded, a technology business that has worked with institutions such as the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence and companies such as Google\u2019s research unit DeepMind.\n\nThe scheme will be structured like an apprenticeship, with workers spending a fifth of their time away from their day-to-day roles studying coding and other digital skills with the retailer\u2019s data. Marks and Spencer is funding the programme in part through the UK government\u2019s apprenticeship levy, which helps companies fund workplace training for staff.\n\nAmong other companies to have launched retraining programmes to boost digital skills is AT&T, the US telecoms group. It announced one of the most ambitious programmes last year, with plans to retrain its more than 250,000 workers in tech skills through partnerships with multiple universities and online platforms.\n\nAnother US company, retailer Walmart has set up \u201cacademies\u201d to train customer service managers and online grocery pick-up staff. Meanwhile, German software company SAP has launched a series of boot camps and peer coaching to teach digital skills.\n\nThe efficacy of these programmes has yet to be demonstrated, however. \u201cFor now, these [schemes] are exceptions,\u201d says Susan Lund, a leader of the McKinsey Global Institute, the consultancy\u2019s research arm. \u201cThe human resources (HR) challenge in all this is considerable. Budgets for talent will go up, potentially steeply.\n\n\u201cAs workflows and business processes are transformed by artificial intelligence, it is not just workers but HR itself that will need to change and acquire new skills.\u201d\n\nAmazon employee Krishna Iyer shows off an Amazon Go app, the world\u2019s first checkout-free supermarket \u00a9 AP\n\nShe adds that retraining is inevitable as automation renders existing skills obsolete. McKinsey has forecast a dramatic increase in demand for digital skills over the next decade, estimating that by 2030, the time workers spend using advanced technological skills will increase by half in the US and by 41 per cent in Europe.\n\nThe consultancy has predicted a decline in demand for workers such as accountants, record-keepers, meter-readers, cashiers and shelf-stackers, while demand for workers with technological, social and emotional skills will rise.\n\nMiddle managers have a huge impact on the access workers have to workplace training\n\nCurrent vocational training programmes, however \u2014 which account for the education of just under half of the EU\u2019s upper-secondary students \u2014 are not equipping people with the right technology skills, according to Cedefop, the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, an EU agency. This makes work-based tech training ever more crucial.\n\nAccording to Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, the changes could contribute to political unrest if not managed well: \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a lot of anxiety about work in all the advanced countries,\u201d he said in a speech at the Royal Society, a UK-scientific academy, this September.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about jobs, not just about wages and the increasing polarisation of the labour force. It\u2019s about inequality and about what would society be without work.\u201d Failure to manage change, he said, would fuel \u201cnot only the nativism that we are experiencing on both sides of the Atlantic but it could well feed a new era of fascism\u201d.\n\nFrench supermarket group Carrefour, the world\u2019s second-largest retailer, signed a deal with Google in June to open up new ways of reaching online customers. As part of the deal, Google will train 1,000 Carrefour employees in new technologies \u2014 a move that came after Carrefour announced it would make heavy lay-offs as part of a strategic plan that includes an increase in digital investments.\n\nA Carrefour hypermarket near Paris \u00a9 AFP/Getty Images\n\nStudies have shown, however, that the benefits of in-house training might not be shared out equally. An analysis of the European Sustainable Workforce Survey \u2014 an EU-funded project \u2014 carried out in nine countries, showed that older employees were much less likely to participate in workplace training than younger staff. The research also showed female employees were often excluded from training, with older women more often paying for education themselves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that those in the organisation \u2014 especially the middle managers \u2014 have a huge impact on the access workers have to workplace training,\u201d says Jelle L\u00f6ssbroek, a researcher at Utrecht university who carried out the analysis. He is currently working on a study of digital training programmes: \u201cTechnological change will be one of the major trends, as will be the ageing of the labour market. I\u2019ll be interested to see how they combine.\u201d\n\nFor businesses, the biggest challenge is proving the financial benefits of these programmes, especially if staff take their new-found skills to higher-paying jobs elsewhere. The risk of this has led some business leaders to argue that workplace training should be funded by governments, because the ultimate benefit is reaped by society as a whole.\n\nMarks and Spencer hopes to see the benefits over time, with ideas such as checkout-free stores. \u201cWe\u2019ll start to see things happen more quickly,\u201d Haywood says. \u201cThose are the things we\u2019ll use to measure the success of this programme.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "financial-times", "name": "Financial Times"}, "author": null, "title": "Trade unions seek role in age of automation", "description": "Digital transformation is both an opportunity and a threat", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/6d50b080-ad56-11e8-8253-48106866cd8a", "urlToImage": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fe138de20-e17f-11e8-a6e5-792428919cee?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T04:00:29Z", "content": "In September, bus driver Andrew Worth climbed onto the stage at the TUC Congress, the annual get-together for Britains trade unionists.

It was the 150th gathering \u2014 a testament to the longevity of a movement that was forged in the industrial revolution. But Worth was less concerned with the past than with the future.\n\nTransport company Stagecoach was starting to trial driverless buses, he told the audience. \u201cMy role as a bus driver will in effect be over. I wouldn\u2019t have ultimate control of the vehicle, instead I\u2019d be there as emergency-stop button-pusher. Do you think my company would pay me the same rate of pay? Of course not.\u201d\n\nAutomation is a hot topic among trade unions \u2014 and with good reason. A slew of economic studies predict that new advances in robotics and artificial intelligence will automate or change a significant number of jobs in the next few decades. Their forecasts vary wildly on how large the impact might be. But it is impossible to ignore the changes that unionists are already beginning to see on the shop floor. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a battle . . . of who ultimately benefits: the bosses or the workers,\u201d one unionist warned at this year\u2019s TUC Congress.\n\nBut automation could also be a moment of opportunity for unions. After decades of declining membership across the developed world it could be a chance to win new victories for workers and demonstrate the value of unions to the next generation.\n\nAutomation is not a new challenge for the union movement. It was also a big topic at the TUC Congress of 1956, where people were talking about a new \u201celectronic computer\u201d developed by the food manufacturer Lyons. The computer could work out the payslips for 10,000 employees in four hours \u2014 a job that used to require 37 clerks.\n\nIn a pamphlet published in 1956, the TUC took a decidedly optimistic approach. \u201cAutomation offers the prospect of higher pay, greater leisure, and healthier and less strenuous work,\u201d it said, but argued unions would need to make sure the benefits of greater productivity were shared with workers.\n\nThese prescriptions from 1956 are remarkably similar to the ones many unions are proposing in 2018. \u201cAs new tech grows, everyone should get richer,\u201d Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC\u2019s general secretary, said in her speech to Congress this year. \u201cNow, as ever, we demand fair shares. That means higher wages. Less time at work. More time with our loved ones. In the 19th century, unions campaigned for an eight-hour day. In the 20th century, we won the right to a two-day weekend and paid holidays. So, for the 21st century, let\u2019s lift our ambition again. I believe that in this century, we can win a four-day working week, with decent pay for everyone.\u201d\n\nIn Germany, the industrial union IG Metall is already using its power to translate productivity gains from technology into shorter hours of work for the German workforce. Earlier this year, it struck a landmark agreement with the S\u00fcdwestmetall employers\u2019 federation which gave workers the right to move from a 35- to a 28-hour week, while preserving the right to return to longer hours. IG Metall\u2019s chairman called it \u201ca milestone on the path to a modern, self-determined world of work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot uninvent new technology, but we can determine how it\u2019s introduced, and who it stands to benefit.\u201d\n\nTrade unions from many different countries are also studying the Swedish approach to displaced workers. Sweden has \u201cjob security councils\u201d run by employers and trade unions, which give intensive support and retraining to people as soon as they learn they are to be laid off. The system seems to work: about 90 per cent of displaced workers in Sweden are re-employed within a year, compared with about 30 per cent in France and Portugal, according to OECD data. Swedish employers (which fund the job security councils) say the system is worthwhile because it means workers and unions are less resistant to necessary lay-offs, which allows the economy to evolve more smoothly over time.\n\nUnions with high membership rates and constructive partnerships with employers \u2014 like those in the Nordic countries \u2014 are the most confident of securing the benefits of automation for workers. \u201cThe Nordic unions are like \u2018automation, great, bring it on\u2019,\u201d said one economist who met recently with a large number of unions. \u201cBut the French had a much darker view.\u201d\n\nUnions whose membership levels are depleted face a bigger task, since they will need to win new members in unfamiliar sectors and hold onto them, even if they are displaced from one workplace to another. Some unions have struggled with this in the past: as automation shrank the size of the UK manufacturing workforce in the decades after 1956, for example, unions failed to replicate their membership levels in the new and growing service sectors.\n\nBut the threat \u2014 and promise \u2014 of automation might prove a good recruiting tool. As bus driver Andrew Worth said: \u201cWe cannot uninvent new technology, but we can determine how it\u2019s introduced, and who it stands to benefit.\u201d\n\nSarah O\u2019Connor is an FT investigative reporter"}, {"source": {"id": "financial-times", "name": "Financial Times"}, "author": null, "title": "Illegal student labour fuels JD.com \u2018Singles Day\u2019 sale", "description": "Chinese vocational school interns working overtime and night shifts", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9ad4d094-ebd2-11e8-89c8-d36339d835c0", "urlToImage": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F1cd49528-ec1b-11e8-89c8-d36339d835c0?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T04:00:27Z", "content": "More than 100,000 workers helped JD.com sort, pack and ship $23bn of goods during Chinas annual Singles Day sales event this month.
