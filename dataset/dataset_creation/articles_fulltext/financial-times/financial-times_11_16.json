I met a stranger who learnt I was Armenian and who asked a completely normal follow-up question: \u201cHave you been?\u201d\n\nNo, I told him. My grandfather and great-grandparents escaped during the Armenian genocide. Almost all traces of Armenian history from that part of the former Ottoman empire \u2014 now eastern Turkey \u2014 have been destroyed. Because the modern-day nation is on land that was not under Ottoman rule, I never thought it would feel like my Armenia. \u201cI\u2019ll go, eventually,\u201d I said. This was language I was repeating. I have been saying it all my life.\n\n\u201cHuh,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to go for some time now, so I might just bite the bullet. My friend went and said she had the best time. It seems to have culture, delicious food, excellent music and mountains. I mean, what more do you need?\u201d\n\nI blinked. He was going to Armenia? The country, heavy with symbolism in my mind, was not somewhere a tourist could just visit for a cheap week away. If he could \u2014 which, of course, he could \u2014 why was I making such a big deal about my own eventual trip?\n\nIn May, Armenia nudged me again. The Financial Times was covering the country\u2019s Velvet Revolution\u2014 Armenians, after a month of entirely peaceful, nationwide protest, unseated their prime minister and replaced him with opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan. The revolution was an overwhelming success. Knowing my background, an editor in our newsroom asked for my thoughts on it.\n\n\u00a9 Vahram Muradyan\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I know very little about Armenia the country,\u201d I told her. In 1922, a few years after the genocide ended, Armenia was incorporated into the Soviet Union, where it remained for 70 years. My mother\u2019s family always thought Eastern Armenians (those from the nation of Armenia) would be more culturally Russian than those of our heritage, which was influenced more by the Greek, Armenian, Jewish and Ottoman cultures that had coexisted for centuries under Ottoman rule.\n\nWe thought of ourselves as Western Armenian, members of the diaspora. When my family left, we took that culture with us in a time capsule. Different food. Different dialect.\n\nI heard myself saying these things, and I didn\u2019t like it. Who was I kidding? Why had I never been to Armenia?\n\nThe third time Armenia showed up was in July. I received an invitation to a press event in New York. The poet Peter Balakian, whose 1997 memoir Black Dog of Fate is a resonant exploration of growing up Armenian in America, was due to speak. I was tired, but I felt the pull. So I took the subway uptown.\n\nHalfway through the event, I texted my family\u2019s group chat.\n\nLive texting you from this Armenia event.\n\nDid you know the oldest known winery is in Armenia?\n\nThe food looks insane. Basturma for breakfast!\n\nOne of the safest countries in the world?!\n\nOK, they got me. I\u2019m going. September. Who wants to join?\n\nMy sister responded. \u201cSeptember\u2019s like, tomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe next year.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Armenia was nudging my mother, too. When I called her that night, she told me about a recent conversation with a woman she knew. \u201cStop waiting for next year,\u201d the woman had told her. \u201cIt\u2019s not the moon. What\u2019s the big deal? Just go!\u201d\n\nIt was the moon. To us, it was the moon. But people have been to the moon. So I booked flights for my parents and me.\n\nWith a last name like Raptopoulos, my Greekness is a public fact that I carry everywhere. It is also tangible: I hear it in my father\u2019s accent, see it on my trips to Greece; I even speak the language, albeit haltingly. But my Armenianness is fully cultural, just an idea. It is something I work overtime to keep alive. My grandmother, my mother and now my sisters and I stuff green peppers with ground beef, rice, cumin. We know how to skewer slippery cubes of lamb into shish kebabs.\n\nOne day I called my mother. \u201cI woke up missing my mom today,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019m making a cheese boerag.\u201d As she spoke, she was layering filo dough in a pan, brushing each sheet lovingly and hastily with melted butter, filling the middle with farmer\u2019s cheese, feta cheese, garlic powder, an egg, then putting it in to bake.\n\nIn my hometown of Brookline, Massachusetts, every Armenian I knew was related to me. As a child, I explained the intricacies of the genocide to my American friends\u2019 parents. Not visiting Armenia seemed like procrastination, but it wasn\u2019t. It was a block. Maybe it represented danger, the source of the trauma. My family, like many in the diaspora, had a misconception of how the country would be. We weren\u2019t sure we\u2019d belong. It took a collection of cues to get us there.\n\nI met my parents at the luggage carousel in Yerevan, the capital, at midnight in September, seven months after my first cue. We had flown in separately and were giddy, our senses tingling, everything new and out of context. \u201cIt smells sweet,\u201d my mother said, a fact that made her happy.\n\nArmenia today is a small, landlocked Christian nation of 2.9 million people. Travel is quite cheap for western tourists, so we organised a driver for the whole trip, Rafael Hovakimyan, and a tour guide for three days in the countryside, Katar Taslakyan. Both became like family; they\u2019re in half of my photos.\n\n\u00a9 Vahram Muradyan\n\nRafael was at the airport the night we arrived. \u201cArmenia welcomes you,\u201d he told us. \u201cI know that you will leave this country in love. Everyone does.\u201d\n\nFor the first two days, my parents and I kept repeating, \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re in Armenia\u201d, like wind-up dolls. Yerevan feels like a small southern European city \u2014 outdoor caf\u00e9s and wine bars, unique museums, a symmetrical central square. The snow-capped Mount Ararat, biblically the landing place of Noah\u2019s ark, stands in constant view.\n\nThe children on billboards looked like me. My mother kept remembering forgotten phrases from her childhood. At a market, she turned to me. \u201cMy mom used to say Kah-nee-yeh. It means \u2018How much?\u2019 Watch this.\u201d\n\nWith the confidence of a local, she hollered \u201cKah-nee-yeh\u201d to the vendor. He responded in full Armenian sentences. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I actually don\u2019t know what that means,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just checking to see if it worked.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, as we ate eggs scrambled with tomato, my mother stopped someone walking by. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you. My father used to make this every Sunday. Is it called doma-tizo-havgeet?\u201d It was.\n\nWe had found a place in the outside world where our secret family language worked.\n\nMy father was our affable travel companion, returning the favour to my mother, who has joined him on dozens of visits to Greece over their 45 years of marriage. His parents, in an odd twist of fate, also grew up in Western Armenia during the Ottoman empire. In 1922, the Turks had agreed with Greece on an exchange of populations. The Greeks in Turkey, including my father\u2019s parents, walked a thousand miles to Greece in caravans; the Turks in Greece made the converse trip.\n\nMy parents met in New York City and realised quickly that their families had been neighbours in Asia Minor. They were both from the same place, shuffled and re-sorted by history, an imperial chess game in which they had no control. When my grandfathers met for the first time, one didn\u2019t speak Greek and the other didn\u2019t speak English. They communicated in Turkish, the language of their oppressors.\n\nA few days into our trip, I asked my father how he felt. We were walking around Yerevan \u2014 like every day, the weather was warm, sunny and dry. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s on the cutting edge of change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like Greece in the 1970s. It feels familiar, but it\u2019s not mine. But you\u2019re the one who\u2019s Armenian. How does it feel to you?\u201d\n\nI felt so lucky in that moment \u2014 Greece was not my mother\u2019s. Armenia was not my father\u2019s. But both could be mine.\n\nFor three days we travelled through the countryside, past dramatic scenes \u2014 burnt yellow mountains, a brilliant blue Lake Sevan, gorges that sliced rolling hills in half, tiny monasteries tucked into rock and growing from the land as if they had living roots. We drove through villages that were littered with memories of Armenia\u2019s Soviet past: cement homes with tin roofs, vast abandoned factories.\n\nLate one afternoon, we walked into the grounds of a 6th-century monastery called Odzun. A local festival was wrapping up and children were chasing each other. I looked up to see my mother sitting on the steps of a monument surrounded by children. Their arms were wrapped around each other like old friends, chanting \u201cAr-men-ia! Ar-men-ia!\u201d As we left, one boy said to my mother in the little English he knew, \u201cBye bye! I love you!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I love you too!\u201d she cried, her arms outstretched. \u201cCome to Boston and you can stay at my house.\u201d That we ever worried we might not belong suddenly became laughable; the number of years we had lost, when we could have had Armenia as another home, felt palpable.\n\nMy mother\u2019s father, Manuel BozBeckian, survived the genocide, in which an estimated 1.5 million Armenians were killed in 1915. The genocide was directed primarily by Talaat Pasha and the Young Turks, the nationalist party in power at the end of the Ottoman empire. I tell the BozBeckian story often and openly. It feels like the only way to keep the history alive. So I\u2019ll tell you now.\n\nIt was 1915, and Manuel was six years old. One night at dinner, his father was taken outside their home and shot. The rest of his family \u2014 his mother, brother, sister and himself \u2014 were pushed into line on a long walk into the Syrian desert. To die.\n\nManuel BozBeckian, who fled the Armenian genocide as a boy, shown here with his wife Pilune Kirkorian\n\nThis is how most Armenians died: they were robbed, deprived of food and water, often raped and killed. People dropped out of the lines like flies. If you go to parts of the Syrian desert now and touch the ground, you find bones.\n\nSomewhere along the walk, my great-grandmother witnessed a fight between two Young Turk generals and was brought to a nearby city to testify. She had to put her three children in an orphanage while the testimony went on. She was gone for a year; I can only imagine what she had to do to survive. When she returned to the orphanage, my grandfather was the only one of her children left alive. The word used was always malnutrition. But children in Turkish state orphanages during the genocide were tortured and starved.\n\nAfter a number of years travelling, Manuel and his mother made it on to one of the last boats to America from Constantinople, through Ellis Island. By then he was 13. When I was 13, I had my own bathroom, a growing CD collection and a job walking my neighbour\u2019s dog.\n\nFather shot, caravan into the desert, testify, orphanage, malnutrition, Ellis Island. These words are stitched into me. I\u2019ve been told that traumas like these are passed down generationally, that I have a diluted version of it and that it will continue on, even more diluted, to my children. How could this not be true? Manuel is the man that raised my mother.\n\nThe diaspora today is large \u2014 about 11 million \u2014 and spread across the world, from Russia to the US, France, Lebanon, Iran and Argentina. It is only 3.5 million smaller than the world\u2019s Jewish population. The genocide is still a live issue: Turkey continues to deny it and, due to lobbying and the pressure of strategic alliances, it has still not been acknowledged by the US, the UK, Israel or all but 29 countries around the world.\n\nI have always been defined by my grandfather\u2019s story. But over the course of these 11 days in Armenia, I began to feel that my attachment to the genocide was a privilege \u2014 I could come here and explore my roots freely, because my family\u2019s experiences have improved so radically in the years since.\n\nWhile my grandparents built lives, Armenia continued to struggle. It was relatively stable during Soviet rule, though heavily dependent, until 1988, when it suffered a catastrophic earthquake that killed 25,000 people. When the USSR fell in 1992, the economic support it had given the country went with it. Left with an unreliable supply of energy, Armenians lived with about an hour of electricity a day for four years.\n\nThe people we met who have memories of the 1990s told us of the \u201cdark years\u201d, when one of the few things they could rely on eating was trout from Lake Sevan. They remembered cutting down trees with their fathers for warmth in cold winters. (Today, the country is still trying to recover from overfishing and deforestation.) They remember a war with Azerbaijan from 1988-1994 over contested borders of the Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabach, an unresolved conflict still considered one of wider Europe\u2019s most unstable potential flashpoints.\n\nArmenia has good diplomatic ties with almost everyone but its two direct border neighbours, Turkey and Azerbaijan. Its history with Russia adds a layer of complication; though they are close, Russia likes its former states to need it. Russia sells weapons to Azerbaijan and Armenia at the same time.\n\nIn recent years, the country has become a base for members of the diaspora living across the Middle East, including more than 17,000 Syrian Armenians. One evening we had dinner at Derian, a Syrian-Armenian restaurant in Yerevan, with an Armenian-American named Suzanne Daghlian. She had \u201cfelt the pull \u2014 I can\u2019t explain it\u201d and moved permanently to Yerevan in 2013. Her friend Davit had come to Armenia from Aleppo a few months before the Syrian civil war began. Once fighting started back home, his family suggested he stay.\n\nDavit is 27. He joined us for a glass of raki and told us things were bad but could have been worse. He was lucky. His family in Aleppo had lost power, water and heat for two full years. His aunt\u2019s building was struck by a missile; many of his friends had been kidnapped or killed; they struggled with depression and unspeakable pain. But you can\u2019t compare pain, he told us. In parts of Africa people are starving, and we are dying because of war, and we just really can\u2019t compare it.\n\nA Syrian-Armenian family from the next table began to chat with us. They had gone to school with Davit in Aleppo and recognised each other here, in this restaurant in Yerevan. They offered us some of their son\u2019s birthday cake. We said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s OK,\u201d and laughed, but the child\u2019s mother picked up the cake, filled her fork and brought it to each of our mouths.\n\n\u201cKer\u201d, she told us. Eat.\n\nHere I was, Lilah from Brookline, Massachusetts, standing with a fellow Armenian. She had a similar family history of persecution, but had recently survived another vivid round of trauma. When in need, this country welcomed her, a cultural meeting place that also welcomed Davit, and Suzanne, and me. She was feeding me, simply because she is Armenian and it is important to feed.\n\nThe next day we visited Mother Armenia, a Statue of Liberty-like monument that overlooks Yerevan from the top of its highest hill. It replaced a monument of Joseph Stalin that was pulled down in the 1960s. She is severe, made of copper, her elbows at right angles. She holds a sword in her hands. I was shocked to see that sword.\n\nI suppose I thought, naively, that after the genocide, Armenians\u2019 wellbeing was a settled matter. Sure, their post-genocidal partition wasn\u2019t large, but it was theirs and they were safe. Instead, I found a country not fully calm.\n\nOn one of the last days, I told Rafael that I was sure he had many tourists like us, from the diaspora, who arrive with the genocide at the top of our minds. I asked whether it bothered him that we were so caught up in the fight for genocide recognition while Armenia was still struggling in so many other ways. \u201cYes, we have to look forward. But I think it is good that the diaspora talks about the genocide, because it reminds the world of our power,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt shows strength that you will not let it go. If Turkey or Azerbaijan tries to start a war with us, they know the world is watching.\u201d\n\nDespite these tensions, Armenia has one of the lowest crime rates in the world, and its people are full of optimism. The revolution in May was organised through Facebook, Twitter and Signal by a generation that doesn\u2019t remember Soviet rule, is well educated, highly skilled in technology and has grown up online. Its leader, journalist turned opposition politician Nikol Pashinyan, set ground rules: no violence, no resistance; if someone tries to arrest you, allow them; everyone off the streets at 10pm.\n\n\u00a9 Vahram Muradyan\n\nAs in many post-Soviet states, for years oligarchs held substantial economic and political control in Armenia. Corruption, including bribery and electoral fraud, was common. In April, the public watched with hope as their country transitioned from a semi-presidential republic to a parliamentary democracy, with the promise from two-term president Serzh Sargsyan that he would not appoint himself prime minister. When he broke this promise, the revolution began.\n\nIn the seven months since Sargsyan stepped down, Pashinyan\u2019s number-one goal has been to root out corruption. He has cut back the country\u2019s police force; now traffic cops no longer stop drivers to demand bribes. He has criminalised rampant vote-buying and investigated \u2014 and charged \u2014 oligarchs for widespread tax fraud, bringing millions back into the system to reinvest.\n\nPashinyan recently called for a snap election and, on December 9, citizens will have a chance to replace their current parliament with politicians they trust. For the first time, it will be a free and fair election.\n\nOne evening I met Armen Der Kiureghian, president and co-founder of the American University of Armenia. We had dinner on an outdoor patio in Yerevan, wrapping fresh, spongey lavash flatbread around sprigs of mixed herbs. I asked him what he wanted to see in Armenia over the next 10 years.\n\n\u201cThat people don\u2019t leave,\u201d he said. \u201cThat people come back, and that the diaspora realises that this is the perfect time to invest. If Pashinyan can root out corruption, Armenians will be able to start businesses. They want to work hard.\u201d\n\nOur last night was my mother\u2019s 69th birthday. It was our final meal in Yerevan: kofte, dolma, tourshi, manti. My father turned to my mother. \u201cSo, Debbie, do you feel like this is your country?\u201d he asked.\n\nShe thought for a second. \u201cI feel like I have a culture, and that culture has a country.\u201d\n\nLilah Raptopoulos is the FT\u2019s community editor; lilah.raptopoulos@ft.com\n\nFollow @FTMag on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nThis article is from today\u2019s FT Opinion email. Sign up to receive a daily digest of the big issues straight to your inbox.\n\nAfter another day of chaos for Theresa May, the echoes of the Suez crisis are growing harder to ignore, writes Philip Stephens in his column. Just as Anthony Eden\u2019s failed 1956 expedition to regain control of the Suez canal forced Britain to take a long, hard look in the mirror, so the string of ministerial resignations protesting Mrs May\u2019s withdrawal deal showed the prime minister an ugly truth.\n\nThis is a rotten deal that the UK parliament should have no hesitation in rejecting, argues Philip. It would leave Britain poorer, weaker in the pursuit of its national interests and less secure. What is more, no one voted for the chaotic halfway house that is now proposed. Suez became a byword for political duplicity and self-delusion. Brexit is taking the same course.\n\nRobert Shrimsley warns that Conservative Brexiters risk killing off their own project. It is hard to find anyone outside Mrs May\u2019s inner circle who believe her deal can be salvaged. But Martin Wolf remarks that the deal has at least had the effect of uniting the country: everyone agrees it is a terrible option.\n\nGillian Tett writes that early signs show China is winning the trade war stoked by US president Donald Trump. The White House\u2019s obsessive focus on its bilateral trade deficit is a distraction from legitimate grievances.\n\nAnjana Ahuja weighs the significance of the redefinition of the kilo. Subject to an international vote on Friday, the unit will no longer be based on an ingot of platinum-iridium in a vault in Paris.\n\nJude Webber observes that Mexico\u2019s incoming president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, has his work cut out for him if he wants to keep both Mexicans and the markets happy.\n\nWhat you\u2019ve been saying\n\nEU membership never affected our sovereignty: letter from Roisin Lee, Belfast, N Ireland\n\nI am surprised that Peter Mandelson, in his clear exposition of the paradox of Brexit, uses the phrase \u201closing further sovereignty\". Sovereignty was never affected by membership of the EU. To quote from the government white paper on Brexit published 19 months ago, \u201cParliament has remained sovereign throughout our membership to the EU\u201d. Perhaps this should be written on the side of campaign buses, should there be a second referendum.\n\nIn response to \"Esther McVey and Dominic Raab departures leave Theresa May teetering\" , Russian Brit says\n\nIs it the same Raab who negotiated this agreement in the first place?\n\nShareholder welfare may simply be value over time: letter from Christopher Cox, Taynuilt, Argyll and Bute, UK\n\nClare Chapman and Will Hutton ( Letters) make an interesting point about shareholder welfare versus shareholder value. Ultimately, welfare could be considered as value over time. It may be that the problem is not one of defining purpose, but rather a question of looking further ahead.\n\nToday's opinion\n\nRedefining the kilo marks a weighty moment for metrology\n\nThe measure is the last remaining major unit to be based on a physical object\n\nLex: Brexit/UK markets: cloud atlas\n\nNervousness of global investors towards UK equities and gilts presage stormy times\n\nChina is winning the trade war with America\n\nThe White House would do better to focus on areas of legitimate grievance\n\nKeeping both Mexicans and financial markets happy is a tricky task\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador will need to keep investors on his side to deliver reform\n\nFT Alphaville: Forking hell, crypto is collapsing!\n\nGlobal Insight: Donald Trump\u2019s blind eye to the Khashoggi murder\n\nUS president will not be distracted from his endgame \u2014 a showdown with Iran\n\nInstant Insight: Theresa May\u2019s terrible Brexit deal has united the UK in horror\n\nWe need a path that avoids a brutal and damaging rupture with EU and its consequences\n\nFT Magazine: How Brexit Britain lost friends and alienated people\n\n\u2018May\u2019s cabinet has displayed an incompetence that has baffled Brussels\u2019\n\nInstant Insight: Theresa May and her Brexit deal teetering on brink\n\nResignations set stage for rejection of prime minister\u2019s deal for departure from EU\n\nParliament should reject Theresa May\u2019s rotten Brexit deal\n\nBritain will be granted influence only to the extent that it signs up again to EU rules\n\nFT View\n\nThe FT View: Britain\u2019s priority is to avoid a no-deal Brexit\n\nTheresa May\u2019s exit deal is flawed.
