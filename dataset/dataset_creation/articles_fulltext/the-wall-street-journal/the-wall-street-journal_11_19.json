Last year, he told me that he schedules his appointments one year in advance.\n\n\u201cI have four places where I work,\u201d he said during an interview in New York, for which he came on a tight timetable and armed with an entourage of staffers. He ticked off Amsterdam, Paris and two offices in Tokyo. That was \u201con top of going from time to time into the operations just to make sure that we don\u2019t lose contact with reality.\u201d\n\nThe hurried life came to an abrupt halt on Monday when he was arrested in Tokyo on financial charges. Nissan Motor Co. NSANY -0.88% , the auto maker he salvaged in the late 1990s, intends to oust him after uncovering significant misconduct. Nissan is tied to Renault SA in an alliance Mr. Ghosn formed and long led.\n\nCar executives once upon a time played the role that Silicon Valley founders like Facebook \u2019s Mark Zuckerberg or Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos play today. Icons like Lee Iacocca, Henry \u201cThe Deuce\u201d Ford II and Fiat\u2019s Gianni Agnelli were watched, with highflying lives, brash managerial styles and colorful comments closely documented.\n\nAuto executive, Carlos Ghosn, was the architect of an alliance between Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi, a rare success story of auto makers working together. WSJ reporters analyze the impact on his legacy following his arrest over financial misconduct. Photo: Getty Images\n\nMr. Ghosn is a throwback to those days, often treated as a superstar in the Japanese media for his exploits. He was depicted as a comic book hero and more recently had his biography published in portions by prominent newspapers. In 2006, a colleague and I wrote a Wall Street Journal profile characterizing him as \u201cThe Hottest Car Guy on Earth.\u201d\n\nDuring a dinner interview in his hotel suite back then, Mr. Ghosn washed down filet mignon with a Bordeaux before quickly launching into a clear and comprehensive answer to a question.\n\n\u201cThese bigger-than-life personalities are necessary to achieve exceptional things, but they come with enormous downsides,\u201d Bob Lutz, a longtime auto executive who served as General Motors Co.\u2019s vice chairman, told me Monday. The cigar-chomping Mr. Lutz was also no stranger to the spotlight.\n\nMr. Ghosn\u2019s abrupt fall has consequences for the global car business beyond the companies he ran. He was among the last globalists standing in an industry whose captains increasingly see as too fragmented and regional to consolidate.\n\nLike-minded counterparts have been falling by the roadside for years. Martin Winterkorn, one of the architects of the multi-headed behemoth that is Volkswagen AG , was taken down in a 2015 emissions-cheating scandal; Sergio Marchionne, the chain-smoking executive who married Fiat SPA and Chrysler, died in July; Daimler AG Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche\u2014who struck an alliance with Mr. Ghosn\u2014will step down in six months.\n\nMessrs. Ghosn and Marchionne both saw a need for increased scale in an auto business that is brutally cyclical and takes piles of cash. Under this theory, alliances join to share costs of battery development or artificial-intelligence research.\n\nBut mergers have now been largely discounted in the auto industry, with critics pointing to the failed tie-up of Chrysler and Daimler in the early part of this century as an example of a marriage gone wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time since Mr. Ghosn struck out in his grandest quest. A dozen years ago, he tried to add General Motors Co. to the Nissan-Renault alliance but was rebuffed by executives running a U.S. auto company that was still No. 1 in sales even as it tried to shrink its way to profitability.\n\n\u201cMy question was how do you keep this straight?\u201d Mr. Lutz said, referring to his discussions back then with Mr. Ghosn.\n\n\u201cSure, within a region like North America, an alliance could work because when you consolidate and close operations near each other, you can get huge efficiencies. But across the Atlantic? Hell, you can\u2019t consolidate purchasing and legal and accounting at that level.\u201d\n\nOthers, from Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s Akio Toyoda to Ford Motor Co.\u2019s Bill Ford, have also adopted the defensive posture, particularly as the auto industry\u2019s future looks increasingly uncertain. \u201cThere is something to be said about smaller, leaner and uncomplicated ventures,\u201d Mr. Lutz said.\n\nWhen GM CEO Mary Barra rejected Mr. Marchionne\u2019s more recent merger attempts earlier in the decade, she pointed to a need to make bets that were smarter but not necessarily bigger. Ms. Barra is a poster child for modern automotive leadership, pulling out of major markets, including Europe, to fund big technology initiatives needed to fend off Alphabet Inc., Uber Technologies or Tesla Inc. in the race to make self-driving electric cars.\n\nMr. Ghosn, meanwhile, hadn\u2019t abandoned his expansive visions, recently acquiring scandal-plagued Mitsubishi Motors in a bid to become the top-selling car maker in the world. He aimed to sell as many as 14 million vehicles annually in fairly quick order, or one-third more than the current No. 1 Volkswagen currently sells.\n\nHe also sought to build a bridge between yesterday\u2019s auto industry and whatever happens next. While most of Nissan-Renault\u2019s vehicles rely on 120-year-old technology (combustion engines and steering wheels), Mr. Ghosn was an evangelist for automated driving and battery power. Nissan\u2019s Leaf was among the industry\u2019s first electric cars and it remains a best seller.\n\nNissan and Renault may endure, but any drive to globalize the auto industry will be significantly set back if those two companies separate in the wake of Mr. Ghosn\u2019s new troubles.\n\n\u201cGlobalization is facing challenges because people have forgotten the advantages it has brought,\u201d he said shortly after Donald Trump was elected president on an \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform. The problem, Mr. Ghosn said, wasn\u2019t enough people were talking about potential benefits.\n\nFrom where he sits now, there\u2019s little Mr. Ghosn can do to revive that conversation.\n\nWrite to John D.

But this week travellers will experience one side effect of prosperity, if only a temporary one. According to the American Automobile Association:\n\nThe organization expects the worst traffic to occur in San Francisco, New York City and Boston and adds:\n\nAAA projects 54.3 million Americans will journey 50 miles or more away from home this Thanksgiving, a 4.8 percent increase over last year. The 2018 holiday weekend will see the highest Thanksgiving travel volume in more than a dozen years (since 2005), with 2.5 million more people taking to the nation\u2019s roads, skies, rails and waterways compared with last year. For the 48.5 million Americans planning a Thanksgiving road trip, INRIX, a global mobility analytics company, predicts travel times in the most congested cities in the U.S. could be as much as four times longer than a normal trip.\n\nAir travel will be historic, according to NBC News:\n\nThe 12-day Thanksgiving air travel period is already under way, and trade organization Airlines for America predicts a record 30.6 million passengers will fly on U.S. airlines.\n\nThat\u2019s up from the estimated 29 million passengers who flew during Thanksgiving last year.\n\nOnce people finally arrive for the big feast, the news gets much better. Americans can now enjoy both higher wages and declining prices for the traditional dinner. Mark Perry of the American Enterprise Institute observes:\n\nCompared to $49.12 last year, the cost this year for a classic Thanksgiving Day dinner for 10 people is $48.90, and is the third year in a row that the cost of a Thanksgiving dinner has decreased... That decrease in the price for a turkey dinner in 2018 compares to increases over the last year of 2.53% for overall consumer prices and 3.20% for average hourly earnings...\n\nAdjusted for inflation, the cost of a classic Thanksgiving dinner this year is 2.7% less expensive than last year, and the lowest since 2010...\n\nCompared to the cost of a Thanksgiving dinner in 1986 of $65.73 (in 2018 dollars), today\u2019s classic turkey dinner is 25.6% cheaper at $48.90 this year.\n\nSpeaking of counting our blessings, Robert Samuelson shares more good news in the Washington Post:\n\nWe aren\u2019t stagnating, after all.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been hibernating in the Himalayas, you must know of the recent surge in economic inequality. It\u2019s not just that the rich are getting richer. The rest of us \u2014 say politicians, pundits and scholars \u2014 are stagnating. The top 1 percent have grabbed most income gains, while average Americans are stuck in the mud.\n\nWell, it\u2019s not so. That\u2019s the message \u2014 perhaps unintended \u2014 from the Congressional Budget Office, which reports periodically on the distribution and growth of the nation\u2019s income. It recently found that most Americans had experienced clear-cut income gains since the early 1980s.\n\nThis conclusion is exceptionally important, because the CBO study is arguably the most comprehensive tabulation of Americans\u2019 incomes.\n\nMr. Samuelson says that while the famous one-percenters have indeed seen a surge income, he notes that the poorest fifth of Americans \u201cenjoyed a roughly 80 percent post-tax income increase since 1979. The richest quintile \u2014 those just below the top 1 percent \u2014 had a similar gain of nearly 80 percent. The middle three quintiles achieved less, about a 50 percent rise in post-tax incomes.\u201d\n\nAnd of course people move up and down the income scale over time, thanks to the freedom that so many will travel so far and for so long to celebrate this week.\n\n***\n\nBottom Stories of the Day\n\nCapitalism: Still Working\n\n\u201cOregon marijuana prices plunge \u2013 and sales soar,\u201d The Oregonian, November 16\n\nGeneralissimo Francisco Franco Is Still Dead\n\n\u201cAndrew Gillum concedes for second time,\u201d Tallahassee Democrat, Nov. 17\n\nAnnals of Socialized Medicine\n\n\u201cFake psychiatrist prompts UK investigation of 3,000 foreign doctors,\u201d CNN, Nov. 19\n\nAnnals of \u2018Academic Mollycoddling\u2019\n\n\u201cUniversity lecturers told DON\u2019T USE CAPS as it frightens students,\u201d Express, Nov. 19\n\n***\n\nBye-ku for Brenda Snipes\n\nYour self-de-voting,\n\nNot lost or fake, we accept;\n\nNo recount needed.\n\n-- Myles C.

Photo: facundo arrizabalaga/epa/Shutterstock\n\nOn a bright November day in 2014, a small group of Italian dignitaries huddled in Rome to discuss a crisis with global implications. They had to meet with a potential defector.\n\nThe young man in question, a shy kid in glasses and a black shirt, came with a highly desirable set of skills. His name was Fabiano Caruana and he played chess, better than anyone in Italy. The officials gathered at Italy\u2019s National Olympic Committee worried that he was going to switch allegiances.\n\nNow, Mr. Caruana is vying to become world champion\u2014as an American. He is deadlocked with Norwegian chess superstar Magnus Carlsen after eight of 12 games held inside a fishbowl-like auditorium in central London.\n\nIf Mr. Caruana prevails, he would give the U.S. its first win in the World Chess Championship in nearly half a century. How he came to represent America is the subject of a seething controversy at the pinnacle of the game.\n\nThough Mr. Caruana was born in the U.S., he had represented Italy for years. The Italians allege he held a highly unusual bidding war involving at least three countries for his services. They say the U.S. bid more than twice as much as the Italians. In a peculiar twist of international gamesmanship, Azerbaijan offered even more than the U.S., they say.\n\nMr. Caruana made his move: He picked America. His team declined to comment on the specifics of the transfer or any financial arrangements.\n\nFurther stoking the debate is the status of the second-best U.S. player, Wesley So. He was born and raised in the Philippines, which he represented for most of his life, and declared his American allegiance just months before Mr. Caruana. Critics say the knights of American chess are nothing but sellswords.\n\nMr. Caruana playing Mr. Carlsen on Nov. 12. Photo: Matt Dunham/Associated Press\n\n\u201cSo they are indeed buying nerds!\u201d Mr. Carlsen tweeted in 2015 when news of Mr. Caruana\u2019s switch became public.\n\nFlipping allegiances is a rare and delicate occurrence in any sport. In the tiny circle of superelite chess, where only a handful of players can aspire to world championships or any degree of fame, switches like Messrs. Caruana\u2019s and So\u2019s can radically alter the international landscape.\n\nThe moves created a narrative: \u201cThe U.S. will not stop buying nerds until we have a world champion,\u201d said Daniel Rensch, an international master at chess and the vice president of chess.com, which features news and games.\n\nRex Sinquefield didn\u2019t set out to become the benefactor who would change American chess. Ten years ago, he was a retired financier in St. Louis who had co-founded Dimensional Fund Advisors, an investment firm that now manages more than half a trillion in assets.\n\nHe is also a chess fanatic, and he wanted to build a chess club. One chance dinner with a board member from the United States Chess Federation and several million of Mr. Sinquefield\u2019s dollars later, St. Louis has become a global chess hub that boasts a Hall of Fame featuring the largest chess piece in the world, at 20 feet tall.\n\nRex Sinquefield, founder of the St. Louis Chess Club, unveiled the world's largest chess piece, a 20-foot-tall king, at the World Chess Hall of Fame. Photo: Tom Gannam/Associated Press\n\nTo Mr. Sinquefield, this was more than a passion project. National pride was at stake. An American hadn\u2019t won the world championship since Bobby Fischer toppled the Soviet Union\u2019s Boris Spassky in 1972.\n\n\u201cWe all knew what we wanted,\u201d says Mr. Sinquefield. \u201cWe wanted an American champion.\u201d\n\nMr. Caruana was born in Miami and, like the controversial Mr. Fischer, raised in Brooklyn. The best players and best tournaments were in Europe, so the budding chess prodigy, supported by his parents, moved to Madrid when he was 12. He began representing Italy, his mother\u2019s native country, shortly afterward.\n\nBecause of Mr. Sinquefield\u2019s patronage, top grandmasters stopped seeing the U.S. as a chess backwater. St. Louis was given a tournament on the prestigious Grand Chess Tour, called the Sinquefield Cup. In 2014, Mr. So announced his transfer from the Philippines.\n\nAround the same time, Italy was trying to persuade Mr. Caruana to stay\u2014but they could only offer him $90,000 a year, Adolivio Capece, a federation official, wrote in an email. He shared what he had heard: that Mr. Sinquefield offered Mr. Caruana $200,000 a year, and Azerbaijan weighed in with even more, but only for one or two years. (He also noted that Mr. Caruana\u2019s Italian was \u201cnot so good.\u201d) The Azerbaijan Chess Federation didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nMr. Caruana played multiple opponents in Italy in 2008, when he was 16. Photo: Pigi Cipelli/Mondadori/Getty Images\n\nMr. Caruana recently said on HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Sports With Bryant Gumbel, \u201d \u201cI can\u2019t really talk about the financial aspect of it, but I was offered support to be back in the U.S.\u201d\n\nMr. Sinquefield said he never paid Mr. Caruana to switch federations. The Chess Club and Scholastic Center of St. Louis, where Mr. Sinquefield is president and chair of the board, does give financial support to Messrs. Caruana and So\u2014among other top American players it sponsors.\n\nIn London, Mr. Caruana said in a news conference he is proud to have the American flag on his side of the board. \u201cIf I have a success, I would like to share it with the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nGrandmaster chess legend Garry Kasparov competed against Wesley So during an exhibition match at the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of Saint Louis in August 2016. Photo: Nick Schnelle/Associated Press\n\nMr. So, who is a Filipino citizen and in the U.S. on a green card, wasn\u2019t financially induced to switch federations, wrote his mother, Lotis Key, in an email. Mr. So hopes to apply for American citizenship next year, she wrote.\n\nThe chess world has praised Mr. Sinquefield for bringing more attention and resources to American chess. And a modern American champion, said World Chess CEO Ilya Merenzon, would be a game-changer. \u201cIf Caruana wins, there will be a \u2018Before Caruana\u2019 and an \u2018After Caruana\u2019 for our sport,\u201d he said.\n\nBookmakers made Mr. Carlsen an odds-on favorite even before actor Woody Harrelson played the ceremonial first move. (Mr. Harrelson bungled it, moving the wrong pawn and accidentally knocking over a king.) Still, Mr. Caruana\u2019s rating is just three points beneath Mr. Carlsen\u2019s\u2014the smallest ever difference for a world championship.\n\nMr. Caruana watched actor Woody Harrelson accidentally knock the white king before making the first move for him in the round one game at the World Chess Championship. Photo: facundo arrizabalaga/epaShutterstock\n\nHis transfer has already paid dividends in other ways. The U.S. won the Chess Olympiad in 2016, its first since the Americans won a title in 1976. (The Soviet Union, however, didn\u2019t participate that year.)\n\nAfter Mr. Carlsen\u2019s Norway finished fifth in that tournament, the world\u2019s No. 1 player tweeted: \u201cProbably need an even better squad to go further though, wonder if Caruana and So are still for sale.\u201d\n\nThe two top players in the world drew each of their first eight games against one another. Mr. Sinquefield says if Mr. Caruana pulls off the upset, the city of St. Louis would be so excited, they\u2019re \u201cnot going to know what to do.\u201d\n\nItalians still claim the defector as one of their own.\n\n\u201cIn any case,\u201d wrote Mr. Capece, \u201cthe Italian press\u2026refers to Caruana as \u2018the Italian player.\u2019\u201d\n\nWrite to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com and Joshua Robinson at joshua.robinson@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": null, "title": "Pelosi's Math Problem: Why Speakership Isn't a Sure Bet", "description": "Rep.

Photo: Alamy\n\nReader reaction to the first-ever Wall Street Journal ranking of large airports zeroed in on a stark reality: Many fliers consider U.S. airports mediocre at best and say they still lag behind the best international airports despite billions of dollars in improvements.\n\nWhat readers do like: medium-size, less crowded, more convenient places to get on and off aircraft such as Tampa, Fla., Portland, Ore., and even Washington\u2019s Dulles International.\n\nIn comments posted to the main story, readers lamented that the rankings covered only the 20 largest airports by passenger traffic. \u201cTampa Airport is hands down the best airport in the U.S. and the best that I have ever flown in or out of, and I have visited over 37 different countries,\u201d subscriber Omar Garcia wrote.\n\n\u201cOrlando?\u201d wrote Mary Mitchell, questioning the second-place ranking behind Denver. \u201cIt is always overcapacity and is a bad copy of the excellent Tampa airport.\u201d\n\nThe Journal rankings were limited to the 20 busiest U.S. airports by passenger traffic because some of the data categories used in the rankings were available for only the largest airports. But there\u2019s another reason to compare only large airports to large airports: fairness.\n\nInside the Airport Rankings The Journal has ranked the 20 largest U.S. airports after weighing 14 key factors plus a survey of over 4,800 readers. Below are the overall rankings, as well as their rankings in groups of measurements labeled most reliable, best value and most comfortable. Click on the airport name to see more details. (1) The average of an airport's reliability, value and convenience scores. (2) Includes on-time arrival percentage, flight cancellation percentage, average arrival delays, average time between gate departure and takeoff and TSA screening times. (3) Includes domestic fares, market share of airport's largest airline, cheapest on-site parking rate, car-rental taxes and UberX fare to convention center. (4) Includes Wi-Fi speeds, Yelp restaurant ratings, maximum walking distances, non-stop destinations and a WSJ reader satisfaction score.\n\nThe biggest airports face different challenges from smaller airfields in terms of delays, cancellations, costs, congestion, walking distance and other factors. Atlanta, which handles 100 million passengers a year, is in a different business from Tampa, which last year had 19.6 million passengers.\n\nThe Journal rankings are based on 15 different measures of reliability, convenience and value, ranging from on-time arrivals to average fares to TSA wait times to Yelp food ratings. One of the 15 categories was devoted to results of an extensive subscriber survey on airports. Each category received equal weight.\n\nLos Angeles International, today the most competitive market in the country with five different airlines running major hub operations there, scored well in several categories, including a low rate of flight cancellations. LAX ranked ninth overall among the 20 biggest. But it finished 19th in the WSJ reader grades.\n\nThat disconnect wasn\u2019t lost on readers, many of whom noted the results failed to consider inconveniences like traffic jams on the horseshoe-shaped roadway in front of LAX terminals.\n\n\u201c \u2018Like judging the prettiest horse at the glue factory.\u2019 \u201d \u2014WSJ reader Patrick Hallinan, sounding unimpressed with any of the largest U.S. airports.\n\nBut when some readers questioned whether LAX was rated too high, others noted the failings of airports ranked lower. \u201cBeen to PHL lately?\u201d was one comment from E. Campbell in response to an LAX criticism. A few readers even suggested the results for Philadelphia International, ranked 17th, was perhaps too generous.\n\nOur use of the word \u201cbest\u201d sparked lots of discussion about the state of U.S. airports. How could New York\u2019s LaGuardia, Kennedy and Newark Liberty International in New Jersey be on any best list, several wondered? If we were looking at the best, why wasn\u2019t Portland, Ore., on the list?\n\n\u201cLooks like Tampa and Portland are not in the top 20 largest\u2014they each have sometimes been ranked as #1,\u201d noted subscriber Thomas Miller.\n\n\u201cPortland is fantastic. Wholeheartedly agree,\u201d added Melissa Romero.\n\nAnd subscriber John Bennett took a more cynical view of the list: \u201cI think there must have been a misprint. These are the 10 worst airports.\u201d\n\nWe use best to signify the top scorers in the universe of the 20 largest airports studied, not to denote that the last-place finishers or even ones in the middle are close to best. The stories and charts made clear that the list of 20 was based on size, not excellence.\n\nStill, best proved to be controversial with regard to even the top finishers. Many readers noted that U.S. airports trail airports in Amsterdam, Dubai, Singapore, Seoul, Tokyo and others in amenities and service, facilities and transportation connections.\n\n\u201cLike judging the prettiest horse at the glue factory,\u201d wrote Patrick Hallinan. \u201cAlmost all of these airports are dreadful on more than one significant dimension.\u201d\n\nWhat was clear from the reaction is that airports are something readers care about passionately. Airports affect our lives. We spend lots of time there. Different travelers value different things. For some, cost is an issue. For others, it\u2019s walking distance, or TSA waits, or bathroom cleanliness. You can have a great experience on one trip and the next trip have a truly painful trip through an airport\u2014love an airport one week and hate it the next.\n\nTaking an objective, data-driven evaluation to compare airports reveals many truths\u2014and fuels opinions. Most of us base our opinions on our experiences, not numbers of nonstop destinations, market-share of the largest carrier, parking rates or rental car taxes. \u201cI wish they\u2019d all get rid of the ugly, dirty carpet that makes it hard to roll your suitcase down long concourses,\u201d subscriber Regana Wills wrote.\n\nBut the rankings did agree with many frequent travelers. \u201cLooks pretty accurate,\u201d subscriber Vito Fortunato wrote. \u201cHaving traveled all over the world, I completely agree that clean bathrooms play a big part in how I view an airport. I still vividly remember the worst airport I\u2019ve been to.\u2026But quite frankly I didn\u2019t mind the airport, just the nightmare of a bathroom which is seared into my memory.\u201d\n\nWrite to Scott McCartney at middleseat@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Anne Steele", "title": "Taylor Swift Tries to Help Fellow Artists With New Universal Music Deal - Wall Street Journal", "description": "Wall Street Journal Taylor Swift Tries to Help Fellow Artists With New Universal Music Deal Wall Street Journal Taylor Swift, the biggest free agent in music, signed a long-term deal with the world's biggest record company, Vivendi SA's Universal Music Group,\u2026", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/taylor-swift-tries-to-help-fellow-artists-with-new-universal-music-deal-1542661152", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37889/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T21:00:59Z", "content": "Taylor Swift, the biggest free agent in music, signed a long-term deal with the worlds biggest record company, Vivendi SAs Universal Music Group, in the process using her clout to try to score some points for other artists signed to the same label.

She also considered options such as distributing her own music, this person added.\n\nFrom Phonographs to Spotify: A Brief History of the Music Industry From the invention of the phonograph in 1877 to the boom in streaming services today, the music industry has had to constantly adapt to emerging technology.

Universal hasn\u2019t indicated it is nearing any sale of its Spotify shares and as recently as May Vivendi Chief Executive Arnaud de Puyfontaine said the company had no immediate plans to do so.\n\nUniversal\u2019s Republic Records, which had been distributing Ms. Swift\u2019s music in the U.S. under her previous deal with Big Machine, will continue to do so in the new contract.\n\nMs. Swift\u2019s older recordings remain under the control of Big Machine, which will continue distributing them via Universal. Any music she records during her new multi-year, multi-album contract with Universal will remain her property, according to Ms. Swift. That is a perk reserved for only the biggest superstars; typical record contracts leave recordings, and the right to exploit them commercially, in the hands of the label.\n\nThe deal is Ms. Swift\u2019s latest public use of her star power as leverage to advocate for artists in an industry whose economics have been upended by streaming. In 2015 she wrote an open letter to Apple Inc., explaining she would hold back her album \u201c1989\u201d from its streaming service because the company wouldn\u2019t compensate musicians and songwriters for the free three-month trial period offered to Apple Music customers. Apple quickly reversed course after Ms. Swift posted the letter online and said it would pay artists after all.\n\nMs. Swift, a 10-time Grammy winner, is the youngest person in history to win Album of the Year, and is the first female solo artist to win it twice. She is the only artist to have four consecutive albums sell more than one million copies in their first week of release.\n\nSeparately, Universal is among those with bids for Big Machine, which has been considering a sale for several years, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bids have reached as much as $300 million, according to another person.\n\nWrite to Anne Steele at Anne.Steele@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Ann M.

He turned around Nissan with heavy cost-cutting and engineered an alliance with Renault SA, later adding Mitsubishi Motors Corp. to create an entity that became one of the world\u2019s largest car makers. But his big pay packages and reputation for holding a tight grip on power meant he wasn\u2019t universally adored.\n\nThe executive works out of four different places: Amsterdam, where he manages the alliance; Paris for Renault and two sites in Japan\u2014the Nissan headquarters and an office at Mitsubishi. He also regularly travels to important markets including the U.S., China, India and Russia.\n\nHis combined salary is worth more than $17 million, and the French government has repeatedly slammed Renault for paying him too much.\n\nIn the fall of 2016, to celebrate Mr. Ghosn\u2019s marriage to his second wife, the newlyweds threw a party at the Grand Trianon at Versailles that was inspired by Sofia Coppola\u2019s 2006 film, \u201cMarie Antoinette.\u201d Hired actors wore 18th-century costumes and guests were served pastry towers, according to photographs of the event.\n\nIn recent years, Mr. Ghosn has faced criticism for his tight grip on power and lack of succession planning: In 2013, his No. 2 at Renault, Carlos Tavares, resigned days after publicly airing his frustration about waiting for his boss to retire.\n\nStill, the alliance Mr. Ghosn built pumped out 10.6 million vehicles last year, just behind Volkswagen AG and ahead of Toyota Motor Corp., adding to his reputation as one of the world\u2019s most successful corporate titans.\n\nThat legacy is under threat after Nissan said Monday that it is seeking to oust him following a monthslong board investigation. Mr. Ghosn has been detained by police in Tokyo. Nissan said its probe found that he allegedly worked with another executive to underreport his compensation in securities filings and misused company assets and investment funds. Mr. Ghosn hasn\u2019t responded to the claims.\n\nMr. Ghosn\u2019s handpicked prot\u00e9g\u00e9 at Nissan, Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa, told the world that his boss may have had too much sway, for too long.\n\n\u201cFrom a governance perspective, it was a problem to have so much power concentrated in one person,\u201d Mr. Saikawa told reporters at a press conference in Yokohama.\n\nThroughout his career, Mr. Ghosn has shown a tendency to micromanage many aspects of the alliance\u2019s business, from tinkering with advertising jingles to walking through factories and correcting workers he thinks are putting things in the wrong bins, according to executives who have worked with him.\n\nMr. Saikawa has said previously that the alliance worked by following \u201chomework assignments\u201d issued by Mr. Ghosn. The new CEO said he has instead urged Nissan employees to be more assertive.\n\nMr. Ghosn developed a passion for cars as a boy growing up in Porto Velho, Brazil, and in Beirut, learning how to distinguish between different makes by the sounds of their horns. He obtained an engineering degree at the prestigious \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris, and took a job at French tire maker Michelin SA, rapidly ascending the ranks.\n\nIn 1996, Mr. Ghosn was recruited to serve as the No. 2 executive at Renault. His subsequent decision to close a Renault factory, which sparked protests in France, earned him the nickname \u201cle cost killer\u201d in the local press.\n\nIn 1999, Renault pumped $5.4 billion into failing Nissan, and sent Mr. Ghosn to turn the company around.\n\nSome executives cautioned against trying deep cuts in Japan. \u201cMr. Ghosn should know that what he can do here is different from the restructuring moves he may be allowed to make overseas,\u201d a top Nissan executive warned at the time.\n\nMr. Ghosn closed factories, slashed head count and cut off poorly performing suppliers\u2014uncommon moves for a major Japanese corporation. At Nissan\u2019s 2000 shareholders\u2019 meeting, one man scolded Mr. Ghosn, calling him \u201cthe destroyer.\u201d\n\nBut when Mr. Ghosn announced Nissan was returning to profitability ahead of schedule, about a year after he took over, he became an instant hero across much of Japan: a symbol of the way Western business practices and good governance could triumph over the country\u2019s traditions.\n\nJapanese businessmen wanted to know where Mr. Ghosn got everything from his glasses to his haircuts. Books touting his management style proliferated: a search for \u201cCarlos Ghosn\u201d on Amazon Japan lists 95 books, from \u201cCarlos Ghosn\u2019s Leadership Philosophy\u201d to \u201cLet\u2019s Speak English with Carlos Ghosn.\u201d In 2001, he was even the subject of a Japanese comic-book series called \u201cThe True Life of Carlos Ghosn.\u201d\n\nHe was in demand on corporate boards, serving as a director at International Business Machines Corp., Alcoa Corp. and Sony Corp.\n\nMr. Ghosn wasn\u2019t shy about his success. \u201cI would have chosen me, too\u201d to lead Nissan\u2019s revival, he wrote in his 2003 autobiography, which was a best seller in translation in Japan.\n\nIn 2005, Mr. Ghosn took the helm at Renault. He moved his family back to their Paris home, keeping an apartment in Tokyo. He and his first wife had four children: one born in Brazil and the other three in the U.S. when Mr. Ghosn worked for Michelin in Greenville, S.C., before moving to Renault.\n\nWhile jump-starting Renault, Mr. Ghosn shifted Nissan\u2019s focus toward the profitable U.S. market, and set about blending two very different corporate cultures without merging the two companies.\n\nSeveral factories now churn out both Renault and Nissan-branded cars off the same assembly line. Some of the companies\u2019 models also use common parts in a bid to reduce purchasing costs of components.\n\nIn 2015, Mr. Ghosn sparred publicly with Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s economy minister at the time and now the nation\u2019s president. Mr. Macron had temporarily increased the government\u2019s stake in Renault to nearly 20%, making it the company\u2019s largest shareholder. The move leveraged a newly passed French law to give the government greater voting rights, causing opposition at Nissan.\n\nThe executive has made moves to strengthen the partnership so it would outlast his tenure, stepping back from CEO role at Nissan while remaining chairman. He has stayed on as chairman and CEO of Renault.\n\nLast year, Mr. Ghosn turned Nissan\u2019s helm over to Mr. Saikawa, the man who fronted a Nissan news conference alone on Monday to discuss the allegations against Mr. Ghosn. The feelings roused by Mr. Ghosn\u2019s behavior went \u201cfar beyond regret to strong anger,\u201d Mr. Saikawa said.\n\nWrite to Nick Kostov at Nick.Kostov@wsj.com and Phred Dvorak at phred.dvorak@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Riva Gold", "title": "U.S. Stocks Extend Losses as Tech Worries Deepen", "description": "The Dow dropped about 500 points as U.S. stocks fell with technology behemoths ranging from chip makers to social-media firms hit by a fresh wave of selling.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stocks-climb-as-investors-await-brexit-progress-economic-data-1542617934", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37793/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T19:15:38Z", "content": "U.S. stocks lurched lower Monday, deepening a fall rout that has shaken many investors confidence in the technology titans that had led the bull market higher for much of the past year.

The Japanese auto maker also said it would seek to oust Mr. Ghosn from his position.\n\nAlmost two decades ago, Mr. Ghosn was handed the job of creating what would become an unusually deep industrial partnership between France\u2019s Renault SA RNO 2.28% and Japan\u2019s Nissan, which at the time was struggling financially. He later added Mitsubishi Motor Co. , also of Japan, turning three relatively small players into a colossus that now makes more cars than any other manufacturer besides Volkswagen AG VOW3 -0.62% .

From Detroit to Tokyo, the 64-year-old businessman has won admirers\u2014and critics\u2014for the sometimes-deep cost cutting and layoffs he pushed at the automotive operations he led.\n\nIn France, he earned the nickname \u201cle cost killer.\u201d A comic book about his life was popular in Japan. In recent years, though, Mr. Ghosn has faced criticism for his lack of succession planning and for his high remuneration. In Japan, his legacy more recently has been dented by quality-control issues.\n\nNissan said in a statement that the Yokohama-based company had uncovered \u201csignificant acts\u201d of financial misconduct by Mr. Ghosn.\n\nNissan said the probe started with a whistleblower and said it shared details of its investigation with authorities. Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa said in an emotional news conference late Monday that the company had found Mr. Ghosn arranged to have his compensation figures underreported in stock-exchange filings. Nissan also said Mr. Ghosn improperly filed expenses and used company assets for his private use. The alleged improprieties occurred over many years, said Mr. Saikawa, who was co-CEO at Nissan before Mr. Ghosn relinquished the shared role in 2017.\n\nProsecutors confirmed they were holding Mr. Ghosn on allegations he understated his compensation in corporate securities filings. He hasn\u2019t been formally charged.\n\nMr. Ghosn and a fellow Nissan executive arrested in connection with the case, Greg Kelly, couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Mr. Kelly, who is a U.S. citizen, is a trained lawyer and longtime confidant of Mr. Ghosn. Representatives and family members also weren\u2019t available to comment.\n\nMr. Ghosn is also chairman of Mitsubishi, which said it would seek his ouster.\n\nA statement from Tokyo prosecutors said that in the five fiscal years ending March 2015, Mr. Ghosn received compensation of nearly \u00a510 billion ($89 million) but that Nissan reported about half that amount in filings to the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Prosecutors said he was under suspicion of violating a Japanese law that prohibits false financial filings.\n\nLast year, Mr. Ghosn earned a total of \u00a5962 million in cash and stock for his positions at Nissan and Mitsubishi, according to the companies\u2019 securities reports. Renault paid Mr. Ghosn \u20ac7.4 million ($8.4 million) in cash and stock last year, according to the French car maker\u2019s securities report.\n\nUntil prosecutors or Nissan discloses more detail, it isn\u2019t known how Mr. Ghosn allegedly received the unreported compensation. And if the allegations turn out to be true, there is the question of why he would have wanted to understate his pay and why other executives or accountants at Nissan didn\u2019t discover the discrepancy before the company filed with the stock exchange.\n\nA former close ally of Mr. Ghosn, Mr. Saikawa expressed shock, at times struggling for words during Monday\u2019s news conference. \u201cBeyond being sorry\u2014I don\u2019t know how to say this\u2014I feel strong anger and despair,\u201d he said. At the same time, comments by Mr. Saikawa, a Nissan employee since 1977, underscored more recent misgivings about Mr. Ghosn\u2019s leadership. He outlined a broad critique of Mr. Ghosn\u2019s time at the helm and rejected the view that Mr. Ghosn deserved the main credit for Nissan\u2019s recovery from near-bankruptcy in the late 1990s.\n\nInformation about the investigation into Mr. Ghosn was closely held, Mr. Saikawa said. Other top executives were informed about the allegations Monday afternoon Tokyo time, he said, just hours before Nissan released the information publicly. Renault was also notified Monday, he said.\n\nIn a statement, representatives of Renault\u2019s board said they were awaiting \u201cprecise information\u201d from Mr. Ghosn and planned to meet soon. They also committed the board to \u201cthe defense of Renault\u2019s interest in the alliance.\u201d\n\nFrom the Archives Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn spoke to The Wall Street Journal about the true automobile of the future, the toughest period in his career, and whether he\u2019d rather go on a road trip with Elon Musk or Mary Barra. Photo: Robert Libetti/The Wall Street Journal (Originally Published March 14, 2017)\n\nThe French government owns a large stake in Renault, where Mr. Ghosn, who holds French citizenship, serves as chairman and chief executive. President Emmanuel Macron of France said he didn\u2019t have further details but that the country would remain \u201cextremely vigilant regarding the stability of the alliance.\u201d\n\nRenault shares fell more than 10% in European trading on the news of the arrest, which occurred after the close of trading in Tokyo. Nissan shares were down more than 6% in Tokyo trading Tuesday.\n\nThe Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance stops well short of being a full-blown merger, but the three companies pool technology, basic components, research and development, creating global scale for companies that on their own would be dwarfed by bigger competitors like Volkswagen and Toyota Motor Corp. Together the three partners pumped out 10.6 million vehicles last year, with big market positions in the U.S., Asia and Europe.\n\nWhile Nissan is the dominant member of the alliance in terms of size and financial health, Renault has the edge in the boardroom. It owns 43% of Nissan, while Nissan owns 15% of Renault and vies with Paris, as another big shareholder, for influence. Mitsubishi joined the alliance after Nissan took a 34% stake in the company in 2016.\n\nWith or without Mr. Ghosn, analysts said fast-changing industry trends\u2014not a single executive\u2014are likely to dictate the future of the alliance. When it was first conceived, a prevailing view in the industry was that auto makers needed global scale to compete. But now they are locked in a battle with Silicon Valley over who dominates the future of personal mobility, and the outcome is open. Max Warburton, an automotive analyst at brokerage Bernstein Research, said the global scale Renault sought with Nissan may not be essential to confronting today\u2019s challenges.\n\nRather the imperative may be for Nissan and Renault to seek partnerships with tech companies to secure the technology and develop business models in an automotive world dominated by shared vehicles, self-driving cars and personal transportation that is connected to the internet.\n\n\u201cPerhaps the alliance will be fine without Mr. Ghosn\u2014his importance may be overstated. Or perhaps it will come apart at the seams,\u201d Mr. Warburton said.\n\nMr. Ghosn first developed a passion for cars as a boy growing up in Porto Velho, Brazil, and in Beirut. He has said he learned how to distinguish between different makes by the sounds of their horns.\n\nHe obtained an engineering degree at the prestigious \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris, and took a job at French tire maker Michelin SA, rapidly ascending the ranks before eventually joining Renault as the No. 2 executive. He cut costs sharply and then turned his attention to Nissan after the two companies announced a broader partnership.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nIn 2013, his No. 2 at Renault, Carlos Tavares, resigned days after publicly airing his frustration at waiting for his boss to retire. The French government has repeatedly slammed Renault over Mr. Ghosn\u2019s multimillion-dollar pay package. He accepted a steep pay cut earlier this year to win French approval for him to continue leading Renault.\n\nHis brashness and celebrity-CEO lifestyle also rankled some.\n\n\u201cI would have chosen me, too\u201d to lead Nissan\u2019s revival, he wrote in his 2003 autobiography, a best seller in translation in Japan.

DJO, currently owned by Blackstone Group LP-managed private-equity funds, sells orthopedic-rehabilitation devices.\n\nThe acquisition would be Colfax\u2019s first foray into medical technology. Colfax currently has two main businesses: ESAB, which makes products for welding and cutting devices, and Howden, which supplies air- and gas-handling equipment to the steel and power-generation industries, among others. The Howden brand has been around since 1854.\n\nShares in Colfax fell 15% Monday as Standard & Poor\u2019s placed the company\u2019s double-B-plus debt rating\u2014already one notch below investment grade\u2014on CreditWatch with negative implications, warning that Colfax\u2019s debt-to-earnings ratio is likely to rise with the acquisition. The company\u2019s share price has fallen roughly 40% this year.\n\nColfax pursued the deal to help diversify its portfolio, reduce the cyclical nature of current businesses on its operations and increase profitability, said Matt Trerotola, Colfax president and chief executive, in prepared remarks. DJO had $1.2 billion in revenue for the year ended in September, Colfax said.\n\nDJO Chief Executive Brady Shirley will run DJO Global as a segment under Colfax when the deal closes, Colfax said. He will report to Mr. Trerotola.\n\nOn a conference call with analysts, Colfax\u2019s Mr. Trerotola said a potential sale of the company\u2019s air- and gas-handling business could help Colfax reduce debt. The company had about $1.14 billion in long-term debt as of its most recent quarterly filing.\n\nIn response to a question about the company\u2019s strategic direction, Mr. Trerotola said he expects Colfax to invest in fabrication technology, orthopedic solutions and medical technology.\n\nIn 2017, Colfax sold its fluid-handling business to Circor International Inc. In this year\u2019s third quarter, Colfax bought heater company Advanced Combustion Inc. and ventilation-systems company ACH Equipos Ltda. Early last month, Colfax bought Gas Control Equipment.\n\nColfax reported net sales of $2.68 billion for the nine months ended Sept. 28, according to a securities filing. Of that, $1.62 billion was from the fab-tech business and the rest was from the company\u2019s air- and gas-handling business.\n\nColfax Chief Financial Officer Christopher Hix said on the call that buying DJO will help Colfax\u2019s bid \u201cto become an investment-grade credit.\u201d\n\nWrite to Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Eleanore Park", "title": "An Industrial Kitchen for People Who Love Nature", "description": "An architect wanted to showcase the cabinets\u2019 metal skeleton.

New York designer and architect Wayne Turett pondered this question as he put together the kitchen in his Greenport, N.Y., home. He wanted a space as welcoming as a living room, but the architect of over 30 years also wished to explore his fascination with tectonic structure, the manner in which linear elements are connected. The metal grid that supports the shelving, cabinets and drawers remains visible. \u201cA lot of times kitchen cabinets will hide these structural pieces behind pretty doors,\u201d Mr. Turett explained. \u201cI like to expose it.\u201d\n\nAn added challenge: convincing his wife that this non-traditional cabinetry\u2014including flat fronts with no hardware and drawers that seemed better suited to an office\u2014could appear beautiful, light and organic. To avoid an overbearing industrial vibe, he chose a slender grid system of powder-coated steel and included copious open shelving, letting in light and airiness. The shelves also made room for objects normally sequestered in the living room, offsetting a potentially clinical feel. The outcome: a unique kitchen that\u2019s functional and contemporary but warm enough to make the most important room in the house welcoming. Here are the key takeaways for those who want a similar result:\n\nPhoto: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas\n\nStretch Out Your Color Options\n\n\u201cThe door fronts of the cupboards are actually covered in stretch fabric, so it doesn\u2019t look totally rigid,\u201d said Mr. Turett. The material also allows Mr. Turett to deploy color unconventionally, as he did with the orange faces shown. \u201cWhat I was drawn to is that at any date or time down the road, I could take those off and add a new color,\u201d he noted. Cover your cabinet faces with Shiny Milliskin Tricot Stretch Fabric, $8 per yard, fabricwholesaledirect.com.\n\nTake the Ledge Off\n\nA cylindrical hood added curves to an otherwise angular kitchen and contributes to the room\u2019s sense of lightness. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t block your view because it\u2019s compact and round as opposed to a horizontal surface that\u2019s as wide as the stove and gets in the way of the view,\u201d said Mr. Turett. A similarly self-effacing hood: Faber Cylindra Isola Island Range Hood, $1,929, build.com.\n\nImprove Your Shelf Life\n\nA shelving unit of both glass and metal creates a bridge between the kitchen and other rooms. \u201cIt takes the island out of being a block of something in the middle of the room and turns it into something that\u2019s a function of the living room and kitchen, because you can place all sorts of things on there,\u201d said Mr. Turett. Display your treasures in this VITTSJ\u00d6 Shelf Unit, $60, IKEA-usa.com.\n\nTake It Up a Peg\n\nTo maintain the airiness of the kitchen, Mr. Turett rejected heavy stone and marble and opted for white Formica countertops and pale-grey metal pegboard to clad the kitchen island. \u201cThis has a much lighter feel even though it\u2019s stainless steel,\u201d he said of the pegboard. Ventilate your island with Diamond Plate Galvanized Steel Pegboard, $19 for 16-inches by 32-inches, homedepot.com.\n\nGo to the White\n\nMr. Turett chose Eames-like stools that subtly stand out against the gray island. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t pop like a bright chartreuse or something but it\u2019s definitely a contrast,\u201d he said. The wooden legs, meanwhile, tie in with the heart pine floor and spruce dining table. These mixed-media chairs can also help create a transition between a living room and a kitchen. Modway Pyramid Bar Stools, $295 for set of two, amazon.com.\n\nFind Your Board Room\n\nA cutting board with a lip that can grab the edge of the counter integrates with the counter surface seamlessly and maximizes the counter\u2019s function. Mr. Turett added, \u201cIt also creates a little bit of relief to a large white countertop.\u201d An added bonus: It\u2019s one less item to be pulling in and out of cabinets.

The open kitchen is like a canvas on which you can paint, said Mr. Turett. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of making ordinary objects interesting because of the way they are displayed, making them objets d\u2019art.\u201d This vintage decoy would thrive in the spotlight.

It changes it from a black and white picture to a color picture,\u201d said Mr. Turett. \u201cWe purchased it so that we could heat things like milk,\u201d he added, \u201cbut it looked great with utensils in there.\u201d So would this charming enameled number.

Photo: Anthony Kwan/Bloomberg News\n\nNew CEO Larry Culp is splitting the power unit into two pieces\u2014one running its natural-gas fueled power generation business and another group that will include coal and nuclear power operations. Mr. Culp named CEOs to run those units, reporting directly to him, and Mr. Rice as chairman of one unit.\n\nMr. Rice was formerly GE\u2019s lead international executive and ran GE\u2019s energy business, which included the power business, from 2000 to 2005. His new role is unusual as while each of GE\u2019s major units have CEOs, none of them has a chairman.\n\nIn his short tenure, former CEO John Flannery cleared out much of GE\u2019s top management as he tried to rebuild the company, an approach that worked for him when he ran the health-care business. But as CEO, the moves left a shallower pool of talent with the necessary experience at a time of crisis, something that has concerned analysts and investors in recent months.\n\nMr. Culp, the first outsider in GE\u2019s history to run the company, has expressed his support for current management, but he also has fewer options to change his starting lineup.\n\nThe latest shuffle leaves Russell Stokes in charge of everything except for the natural-gas operations. Photo: General Electric\n\n\u201cI think he is desperate for leadership,\u201d said analyst Scott Davis, who called bringing back Mr. Rice a creative solution. \u201cRice knows power and is good overall.\u201d\n\nMr. Rice spent his final years at GE in Hong Kong building the company\u2019s business outside the U.S. and company officials called him GE\u2019s Secretary of State. He is one of the GE appointed board members at oil-services firm Baker Hughes , which is majority-owned by GE.\n\nUnder Mr. Immelt, Mr. Rice was also seen as the executive who would take charge if anything ever happened to the CEO.\n\nFollowing the tumult in the boardroom and executive suite of the past two years, Mr. Rice\u2019s return leaves him as one of the few of his generation of GE leaders that will still be with the company.\n\nOther than David Joyce, the longtime leader of GE\u2019s aviation, the heads of GE\u2019s other major units have all changed.\n\nGE has also switched CEOs twice and replaced its finance chief in the past year. Mr. Culp, who joined GE\u2019s board in April, took over as CEO on Oct. 1 after GE\u2019s board abruptly fired Mr. Flannery after 14 months. Before him, Mr. Immelt led GE for 16 years.\n\nGE Power, one of the conglomerate\u2019s oldest and biggest divisions, has posted deep losses as management misjudged falling market demand and the 2015 acquisition of Alstom SA\u2019s power business added even more capacity. GE recently wrote off the entire deal as part of a $22 billion accounting charge in the third quarter.\n\nThe unit makes the core of a power plant: massive turbines that run on fuel to generate electricity.\n\nGE has said its equipment generates a third of the world\u2019s electricity.\n\nThe division is also under federal investigation for its accounting practices. The collapse of the business has reduced GE\u2019s cash flow and pushed GE to slash its quarterly dividend twice over the past year to a token 1 cent per share.\n\nUnder Mr. Flannery, the power division was combined in 2017 with a former energy connections division run by Russell Stokes, who became CEO of the enlarged power business.\n\nThe latest shuffle leaves Mr. Stokes, 47, in charge of everything except for the natural-gas operations.\n\nScott Strazik, 40, formerly president of GE\u2019s power services business, will be CEO of the gas power division with Mr. Rice as chairman.\n\nWrite to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Chao Deng", "title": "China's Private-Sector Woes Spur Leaders Into Action", "description": "Beijing has for years squeezed the private sector with policies that support state companies\u2014and is now looking to fix what has become a weak link in a slowing economy.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-private-sector-woes-spur-leaders-into-action-1542623426", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37654/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T16:49:32Z", "content": "BEIJINGChinas government has for years squeezed the private sector with policies that support state companiesand is now looking to fix what has become a weak link in a slowing economy.

Yet figures reviewed by The Wall Street Journal show that those tactics have failed to offset the erosion of what used to be one of the entertainment industry\u2019s most profitable businesses.\n\nFiber-optic broadband services like Verizon Communications Inc.\u2019s VZ -0.88% Fios and AT&T Inc.\u2019s U-verse have shed pay-TV customers most quickly in recent years, though they had a smaller subscriber base from the start.\n\nSatellite operators\u2014AT&T\u2019s DirecTV and Dish Network Corp. DISH -1.92% \u2014have lost the most customers overall. Rich Greenfield, media and tech analyst at brokerage firm BTIG, said satellite firms were more vulnerable to subscriber losses than companies that sell cable TV and broadband access because demand for internet connections remains healthy. Many residents who sign up for cable broadband get TV as part of the bundle.\n\nThe pay-TV decline comes as many U.S. households are turning to the internet for entertainment and canceling their traditional subscriptions, a phenomenon called cord-cutting. A growing share of Americans, known as cord-nevers, are forgoing pay-TV altogether.\n\nResearch firm MoffettNathanson LLC estimates more than 10 million U.S. homes have either cut the cord or skipped over pay-TV distributors since 2010, when the share of households with traditional video service peaked.\n\nDirecTV and Dish have countered by launching their own online video-streaming services with a more limited range of channels, known as skinny bundles. DirecTV Now and Sling TV have been growing, but not fast enough to offset the decline in traditional subscribers.\n\nMost cable companies are reluctant to invest in their own skinny online bundles\u2014also known as over-the-top packages\u2014because they lack a nationwide customer base. But they are embracing on-demand video providers they once considered a threat. Comcast Corp. CMCSA -0.32% , for instance, is offering its customers access to Netflix , NFLX -1.26% YouTube and Sling TV International through its X1 set-top box. The company also recently announced it would offer customers the ability to add Amazon Prime to that system.\n\nMany players outside the cable-TV industry have launched their own skinny bundles, including Sony Corp.\u2019s SNE -1.64% PlayStation Vue, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s YouTube TV and FuboTV, a sports-focused startup. Those services are growing quickly.\n\nBut skinny bundles aren\u2019t as lucrative for providers. Deutsche Bank analyst Matthew Niknam estimates skinny bundles\u2019 profit margins are a negative 6%, versus a positive 38% for traditional pay-TV packages. And even in absolute subscriber numbers, streaming TV\u2019s growth isn\u2019t enough to offset the decline for traditional pay TV.\n\n\u2014Merrill Sherman contributed to this article.\n\nThe cable industry is undergoing a major transformation, as more Americans cut the cord on their cable subscriptions and flock to streaming services like Hulu and Netflix.

She puts on gloves and picks it up.\n\nThen, to the embarrassment of her friends, she scurries to the top of a rock to shout, \u201cWho is littering my playground?\u201d\n\nMs. Deeley, 33, represents a new type of eco-warrior who practices plogging\u2014picking up litter while jogging.\n\nShe started her crusade over a decade ago while living in Costa Rica. \u201cWhen you trail run, you spend a lot of time looking at the ground and can\u2019t help put see the garbage that finds its way under rocks and behind bushes,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d collect microtrash, the things people don\u2019t realize they\u2019ve lost, like a corner of an energy bar wrapper or a hiking pole tip,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen she moved to Vermont in her late 20s, she rarely saw people on the trails of the Green Mountains. But she saw her share of candy bar wrappers and toilet paper.\n\nMs. Deeley scoops up toilet paper on the trail Mount Galbraith Park near Golden, Colo. Photos of her findings get posted to her blog, TP Is Gross. Photo: David Clifford for The Wall Street Journal\n\nShe spent months tidying up quietly and ranting about it to her friends. When they told her to do something about it, she started posting photos of the trash on a blog she called TP Is Gross. She used to seek out solitude on the trails, but now hikes or runs during high-traffic hours on weekends and holidays so she can shame more people who litter.\n\nA distance runner throughout her 20s, Ms. Deeley began to struggle with overuse injuries in her hips and ankles in her 30s. She says plogging has allowed her to find fulfillment in slowing down after years of pushing so hard. \u201cI\u2019m more in tune with nature and my body,\u201d she says. \u201cI notice the way the sun comes through the trees, the different types of mushrooms on the forest floor, how my body is feeling. It\u2019s a very meditative workout.\u201d\n\nMs. Deeley lives in Golden, Colo., and works in sales for ecotravel outfitter Natural Habitat Adventures.\n\nEven when she travels, she hikes and runs with a trash bag and recycles her finds. \u201cIt physically pains me to see something and not pick it up,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can also learn a lot about a city or culture based on what you find on their trails.\u201d\n\nThe Workout\n\nMs. Deeley hikes or runs on the trails of Indian Peaks wilderness area and the Flatirons, both around Boulder, Colo. She gets out for 45 minutes once or twice a week and logs 6 to 8 miles on weekends. Three days a week she uses a Concept2 rowing machine at home. \u201cThe low impact is good for me,\u201d she says. She\u2019ll row 45 minutes at a steady pace, followed by 20 to 30 minutes of intervals. On the weekend she will also climb, bike or, in the winter, backcountry snowboard.\n\nTwo days a week she lifts at her office gym. Her routine focuses on building stability in her ankles and strength for backcountry skiing. She does lunges, squats, planks, hip lifts and step-ups with weights. \u201cI try to do a lot on one foot or on a balance board,\u201d she says.\n\nHer travel routine includes 12 sets of 25 reps each of push-ups, squats and abs exercises.\n\nMs. Deeley prefers the solitude of early-morning hikes but makes a point to hike at popular times on weekends. Photo: David Clifford for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe Diet\n\nMs. Deeley starts her day with hot cereal topped with coconut milk, berries, honey, and seeds including flax, pepitas and chia. Some mornings she adds a scoop of almond butter. She snacks throughout the day on dried fruit, apples, grapefruit slices, almond and cashew butter and homemade rice cakes. After a long hike, her go-to dinner is a burger and a beer. Her hiking pack is always filled with chocolate. \u201cThe darker, the better,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Gear & Cost\n\nMs. Deeley sticks to natural fibers, particularly wool. Of all of her gear, she takes her socks the most seriously.\n\nShe prefers Darn Tough Vermont socks. \u201cThey\u2019re even warm when wet,\u201d she says. She wears New Balance trail sneakers and hikes in Keen boots with Leki trekking poles ($160). Ms. Deeley carries a reusable trash bag on the trails and Outdoor Research merino glove liners ($35) to use when she picks up trash.\n\nThe Playlist\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band and the Grateful Dead are her go-tos for mellow, long hikes, she says. Led Zeppelin and the Black Keys are her \u201cpower tunes.\u201d She listens to \u201990s hip-hop when she runs.\n\nWhen she\u2019s hurting, she turns up James Brown. But most days her favorite soundtrack is Mother Nature.\n\nMs. Deeley regularly hikes or runs. She says trash collecting has helped her find fulfillment in slowing down as she rehabs overuse injuries. Photo: David Clifford for the Wall Stre\n\nHow Plogging Became a Thing\n\nThe term plogging, which means picking up trash while jogging, was coined in 2016 by Erik Ahlstr\u00f6m, a Swede who had moved from a small ski community in northern Sweden to Stockholm.\n\n\u201cDuring my daily cycling commute, I was shocked by the amount of litter in nature,\u201d Mr. Ahlstr\u00f6m says. \u201cI\u2019d see the same debris in the road for weeks, so I began picking it up.\u201d\n\nHe started to organize plogging meetups around the city via social media. He has hosted more than 150 events throughout Sweden. Today, plogging has spread to cities including Paris, New York and Santiago, Chile.\n\nMr. Ahlstr\u00f6m says plogging often burns more calories than jogging, since ploggers incorporate movements such as squats when they bend down to pick up litter. Holding all of the garbage also requires arm strength. He estimates that 30 minutes of plogging will burn 288 calories on average, compared with just 235 calories from regular jogging. You don\u2019t have to run or jog, either.\n\n\u201cPlogging can be done walking down the street, on the golf course, biking, paddle boarding, swimming or wherever you are,\u201d Mr. Ahlstr\u00f6m says. \u201cIt\u2019s a mind-set as well as a workout.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s your workout?

NSANY -0.88% , where Mr. Ghosn serves as chairman, said Monday that it went to the authorities with details of an internal probe that alleged he incorrectly reported his compensation in filings over many years. The Japanese auto maker also said it would seek to oust Mr. Ghosn from his position.\n\nAlmost two decades ago, Mr. Ghosn was handed the job of creating what would become an unusually deep industrial partnership between France\u2019s Renault SA RNO 2.28% and Japan\u2019s Nissan, which at the time was struggling financially. He later added Mitsubishi Motor Co. , also of Japan, turning three relatively small players into a colossus that now makes more cars than any other manufacturer besides Volkswagen AG VOW3 -0.62% . Amid recent strains between partners and a fast-changing auto industry, Mr. Ghosn was the glue keeping the alliance together.\n\nTangled Web Carlos Ghosn is the chief architect of an alliance including Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi.

From Detroit to Tokyo, the 64-year-old businessman has won admirers\u2014and critics\u2014for the sometimes-deep cost cutting and layoffs he pushed at the automotive operations he led.\n\nIn France, he earned the nickname \u201cle cost killer.\u201d A comic book about his life was popular in Japan. In recent years, though, Mr. Ghosn has faced criticism for his lack of succession planning and for his high remuneration. In Japan, his legacy more recently has been dented by quality-control issues.\n\nNissan said in a statement that the Yokohama-based company had uncovered \u201csignificant acts\u201d of financial misconduct by Mr. Ghosn.\n\nNissan said the probe started with a whistleblower and said it shared details of its investigation with authorities. Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa said in an emotional news conference late Monday that the company had found Mr. Ghosn arranged to have his compensation figures underreported in stock-exchange filings. Nissan also said Mr. Ghosn improperly filed expenses and used company assets for his private use. The alleged improprieties occurred over many years, said Mr. Saikawa, who was co-CEO at Nissan before Mr. Ghosn relinquished the shared role in 2017.\n\nProsecutors confirmed they were holding Mr. Ghosn on allegations he understated his compensation in corporate securities filings. He hasn\u2019t been formally charged.\n\nMr. Ghosn and a fellow Nissan executive arrested in connection with the case, Greg Kelly, couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Mr. Kelly, who is a U.S. citizen, is a trained lawyer and longtime confidant of Mr. Ghosn. Representatives and family members also weren\u2019t available to comment.\n\nMr. Ghosn is also chairman of Mitsubishi, which said it would seek his ouster.\n\nA statement from Tokyo prosecutors said that in the five fiscal years ending March 2015, Mr. Ghosn received compensation of nearly \u00a510 billion ($89 million) but that Nissan reported about half that amount in filings to the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Prosecutors said he was under suspicion of violating a Japanese law that prohibits false financial filings.\n\nLast year, Mr. Ghosn earned a total of \u00a5962 million in cash and stock for his positions at Nissan and Mitsubishi, according to the companies\u2019 securities reports. Renault paid Mr. Ghosn \u20ac7.4 million ($8.4 million) in cash and stock last year, according to the French car maker\u2019s securities report.\n\nUntil prosecutors or Nissan discloses more detail, it isn\u2019t known how Mr. Ghosn allegedly received the unreported compensation.

The Japanese auto maker also said it would seek to oust Mr. Ghosn from his position.\n\nAlmost two decades ago, Mr. Ghosn was handed the job of creating what would become an unusually deep industrial partnership between France\u2019s Renault SA RNO 2.28% and Japan\u2019s Nissan, which at the time was struggling financially. He later added Mitsubishi Motor Co. , also of Japan, turning three relatively small players into a colossus that now makes more cars than any other manufacturer besides Volkswagen AG VOW3 -0.62% .

From Detroit to Tokyo, the 64-year-old businessman has won admirers\u2014and critics\u2014for the sometimes-deep cost cutting and layoffs he pushed at the automotive operations he led.\n\nIn France, he earned the nickname \u201cle cost killer.\u201d A comic book about his life was popular in Japan. In recent years, though, Mr. Ghosn has faced criticism for his lack of succession planning and for his high remuneration. In Japan, his legacy more recently has been dented by quality-control issues.\n\nNissan said in a statement that the Yokohama-based company had uncovered \u201csignificant acts\u201d of financial misconduct by Mr. Ghosn.\n\nNissan said the probe started with a whistleblower and said it shared details of its investigation with authorities. Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa said in an emotional news conference late Monday that the company had found Mr. Ghosn arranged to have his compensation figures underreported in stock-exchange filings. Nissan also said Mr. Ghosn improperly filed expenses and used company assets for his private use. The alleged improprieties occurred over many years, said Mr. Saikawa, who was co-CEO at Nissan before Mr. Ghosn relinquished the shared role in 2017.\n\nProsecutors confirmed they were holding Mr. Ghosn on allegations he understated his compensation in corporate securities filings. He hasn\u2019t been formally charged.\n\nMr. Ghosn and a fellow Nissan executive arrested in connection with the case, Greg Kelly, couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Mr. Kelly, who is a U.S. citizen, is a trained lawyer and longtime confidant of Mr. Ghosn. Representatives and family members also weren\u2019t available to comment.\n\nMr. Ghosn is also chairman of Mitsubishi, which said it would seek his ouster.\n\nA statement from Tokyo prosecutors said that in the five fiscal years ending March 2015, Mr. Ghosn received compensation of nearly \u00a510 billion ($89 million) but that Nissan reported about half that amount in filings to the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Prosecutors said he was under suspicion of violating a Japanese law that prohibits false financial filings.\n\nLast year, Mr. Ghosn earned a total of \u00a5962 million in cash and stock for his positions at Nissan and Mitsubishi, according to the companies\u2019 securities reports. Renault paid Mr. Ghosn \u20ac7.4 million ($8.4 million) in cash and stock last year, according to the French car maker\u2019s securities report.\n\nUntil prosecutors or Nissan discloses more detail, it isn\u2019t known how Mr. Ghosn allegedly received the unreported compensation.

She recalls swiping her card and exclaiming, \u201cTake my money!\u201d\n\nUniqlo last year started placing vending machines selling jackets, vests and other clothes in airports around the U.S. Uniqlo declines to discuss its sales. San Francisco International Airport officials say the machine there brings in around $10,000 a month. Later this year, the airport plans to add a Yo-Kai Express Inc. machine that sells ramen noodles.\n\nVending machines selling clothing, makeup, electronics and high-end foods are cropping up at U.S. airports where officials are competing for passengers with improved amenities.\n\nAirports have long tried with shops to get passengers to open their wallets before boarding, but they have to keep things fresh: specialty retail sales, which exclude duty free as well as convenience and newsstand items like gum and magazines, have fallen 10% since 2012 to $1.66 per departing passenger at North America\u2019s top 50 airports last year, according to trade publication Airport Experience News.\n\nNow, airports are using vending machines to test the appeal of more unusual products, airport operators and vendors say. The machines can be stationed in unused corners of an airport and make sales around the clock. Some new machines have touch screens and robotic suction arms to deliver expensive products.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so many stores you can fit in an airport,\u201d says Elias Bizannes, chief executive of ZoomSystems, which operates machines for brands including Best Buy Co., Benefit Cosmetics LLC and Uniqlo.\n\nSarah Skwire, a senior fellow at a think tank in Indiana was on her way to Washington, D.C., when she got a text message that she needed her own makeup for a filming. At Indianapolis International Airport, she found one of the pink, 59 bus-shaped Benefit machines that are parked at 37 U.S. and Canadian airports.\n\nUniqlo last year started placing vending machines selling jackets, vests and other clothes in airports around the U.S. Photo: Uniqlo\n\nBefore, she says, \u201cI would make sarcastic remarks\u2014who\u2019s going to blow $40 on Benefit while waiting for a plane, from a vending machine?\u201d\n\nThis time, Ms. Skwire, 47, bought a travel makeup kit to get herself camera-ready. A few months later, she was back at a Benefit machine after a compact of pressed powder came apart in her bag during a security screening. \u201cI went from a skeptic to a minor enthusiast.\u201d\n\nAt some airports, vending machines offer local flavor. Ted Drewes, a St. Louis frozen-custard institution, has been selling $6 \u201cconcretes\u201d\u2014custard so thick you can turn it upside down without spilling\u2014from machines at St. Louis Lambert International Airport since mid-2015. Travelers bought 15,000 concretes in the machines\u2019 first year and sales climbed 25% the next year, according to AVendCo, which operates the four frozen-custard machines.\n\nAt Pittsburgh International Airport, a vending machine operated by Arcadia Publishing sells books on the history of local neighborhoods for about $20.\n\nGloves, hats and socks are among the offerings in the Buffalo Wool Co.\u2019s machines. Photo: The Buffalo Wool Co.\n\nOther machines offer products that are hard to find elsewhere, including Buffalo Wool Co., which sells gloves, beanies, socks and other goods made from bison wool online and at trade shows. Co-owners Ron and Theresa Miskin spend a month in Alaska each year selling at the state fair, so they knew they could find customers willing to pay $95 for bison-wool gloves at the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport.\n\nBut the company is based in Texas, and Mr. Miskin said it didn\u2019t want to hire employees or rent a storefront. So it got two vending machines. The Buffalo Wool machines in Anchorage can make sales of as much as $500 a day each, he says. \u201cA lot of people fly up there and then fly out to much colder places.\u201d\n\nAirport vending has had its challenges. ZoomSystems filed for bankruptcy in 2015 after several customer projects hit delays and the company breached debt covenants. The company emerged later that year with a plan to repay debt and reduce costs. ZoomSystems was acquired last year, and Mr. Bizannes says it is investing in new robotic and sensor technology for retail.\n\nIn 2013 Flat Out of Heels LLC introduced a vending machine to sell flat shoes to women walking\u2014uncomfortably\u2014through Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. But the machine was often offline because it couldn\u2019t get a strong enough cell signal to process credit-card payments and was removed two years later, says Dawn Dickson, the Miami company\u2019s founder.\n\nMs. Dickson\u2019s other company, Columbus, Ohio.-based PopCom Inc., has spent two years developing an improved vending machine\u2014the PopShop\u2014and plans to use it to relaunch Flat Out of Heels and for other retailers at airports. \u201cIt\u2019s a captive audience,\u201d she says of the airport.\n\nSome companies are also revisiting the vending machine\u2019s original product line: food. Briggo Inc., a Texas company that operates automated coffee kiosks, largely in offices, recently installed a machine at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. It brews customized drinks that passengers can order on a touch screen or through an app while they\u2019re waiting to get through security. Being at the airport, says CEO Kevin Nater, is \u201clike being on the world stage.\u201d\n\nA salad in a jar from Farmer\u2019s Fridge, which has seven vending machines in Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport.

Global economic growth also helped propel sales of American-made goods, though some of the world\u2019s major economies have showed signs of slowing in the third quarter.\n\nJake McRobie, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said he views the new Commerce data as signaling \u201ca return to normal, healthy levels of inventories.\u201d\n\nHowever, a truck-driver shortage in the U.S. has delayed shipments and pushed up delivery costs, making it difficult for some factory owners to keep themselves comfortably stocked.\n\nAt the same time, the Trump administration's early 2018 tariffs and countertariffs by foreign countries are putting pressure on inventories of some products. The administration has imposed tariffs on half the $500 billion in Chinese goods imported annually, and on steel and aluminum from around the world, while threatening to do the same on cars.\n\nThis has caused purchasers of affected products to step up their orders to try to get ahead of price increases, drawing on inventories.\n\n\"The tariffs have caused a mass rush to buy up inventories of affected products in order to minimize the long-term financial impact,\" a computer and electronic products manufacturer told the Institute for Supply Management. \"This, in turn, is causing market constraints, which further drive up the cost and increase lead times.\"\n\nISM's latest manufacturing report showed the fabricated metal products and primary metals industry both reported inventory declines in October. The report also showed inventory declines in other industries such as paper products, signaling the churn is more widespread.\n\nAdditionally, Tim Fiore, head of the ISM survey, said manufacturers\u2019 inventories often fall as they close a quarter, which could explain part of September's decline.\n\nDetermining whether inventories are at a healthy level is tricky. A high level of inventories can imply factory owners are ramping up production as they anticipate rising demand for their products, or it can mean demand unexpectedly flagged.\n\nSome factory owners are responding to the disruptions. Manufacturers in the Cleveland area reported they have \"increased their capital expenditures to keep up with customer demand and to fill supply chain gaps,\" according to a report released by the Federal Reserve late last month.\n\nRELATED\n\nTrump Optimistic About China Trade Deal (Nov. 16)\n\nU.S. Goods Imports and Trade Deficit With China Hit New Records (Nov. 2)\n\nThe U.S.-China Trade Battle Spawns a New Era of Tariff Dodges (Oct. 8)"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": null, "title": "Are North Koreans Veering Off the Diplomatic Track?", "description": "Diplomatic relations between North Korea and the U.S. might be on hold until President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un meet again.

Jeff Sparshott here to take you through the day's top economic news. We also look at upcoming housing data, preparations for the next recession, the gender pay gap, and mutton prices. Let us know what you think by replying to this email.\n\nDEAL WITH IT\n\nProspects for a U.S.-China trade truce aren't looking good. The latest: an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit ended in acrimony on Sunday with a fight over Chinese trade practices. For the first time in APEC\u2019s history, officials ended meetings without issuing a communiqu\u00e9, Rob Taylor, Peter Nicholas and Rachel Pannett report.\n\nThe tensions and lack of resolution at APEC herald the difficulty the two sides will have in reaching any trade deal. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet in Buenos Aires in less than two weeks. The two sides are aiming for at least a cease-fire in the trade fight that would involve a new set of negotiations tied to a U.S. pledge to hold off on additional tariffs.\n\nUNDER PRESSURE\n\nChina's yuan, meanwhile, is coming under pressure as the Federal Reserve tightens and China's central bank eases monetary policy. China\u2019s short-term government debt now yields less than its U.S. equivalent, Mike Bird reports. Investors often flock to higher-yielding currencies, driving up their value. Trade tensions and other economic factors have also helped push the Chinese currency near a 10-year low against the dollar.\n\nThe Trump administration has been unhappy with a weaker yuan, because it makes Chinese goods less expensive in the U.S. But Beijing has defended the yuan to keep it from falling below a symbolic seven to the dollar in an effort to prevent capital flight.\n\nWHAT TO WATCH TODAY\n\nThe National Association of Home Builders housing market index for November, out at 10 a.m. ET, is expected to tick down to 67 from 68 a month earlier.\n\nThe New York Fed's John Williams participates in a moderated Q&A at 10:45 a.m. ET.\n\nThe NAHB index kicks off a busy week for housing data, with new-home construction due out Tuesday and existing-home sales Wednesday. Housing is one of the economy's soft spots, as higher mortgage rates combined with already high prices and limited inventories hold back sales. The weakness has the Fed's eye: \"There are a lot of factors weighing on home building right now. It's material costs, It's labor scarcity, it's difficulty finding lots, it's rates as well,\u201d Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week.\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nTHE RECESSION TOOLKIT\n\nThe U.S. expansion is the second-longest on record. The economy is strong and there's no sign of a looming downturn. But there\u2019s always a next recession. What has the U.S. done to prepare? Here\u2019s a look at the traditional tool kit when a recession hits.\n\n1.) MONETARY POLICY\n\nAs the Great Recession unfolded, the Fed cut interest rates from 5.25% to nearly zero. That\u2019s not an option again\u2014short-term rates are a little over 2% and officials estimate they\u2019ll ultimately settle around 3%. \"While the Fed has other monetary policy tools, such as buying large quantities of government securities, these tools have proved to be politically sensitive, making their deployment in future recessions complicated. Hence, the ability to counter economic downturns with monetary policy alone may be impaired, shifting more of the stabilization burden to fiscal and regulatory policy tools,\" Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren wrote in the Boston Globe.\n\n2.) FISCAL POLICY\n\nAh, but the federal government might not be in great shape to help. Before the Great Recession, federal debt amounted to about 35% of the country\u2019s economic output. It more than doubled to about 77% of GDP by 2016 as the country suffered through a massive downturn and then endured one of the slowest expansions on record. The economy is humming along now but after a big round of tax cuts and spending increases, debt is again climbing\u2014to 78% of GDP in fiscal 2018 and likely more than 80% by 2020. That doesn\u2019t mean more fiscal stimulus is out of the question. In a global recession, U.S. debt could easily remain the least ugly investment available.\n\n\"But it's very clear that we have less fiscal space than we had before,\" says Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \u201cWhether or not we have enough fiscal space we won't know until we are in the moment.\u201d\n\n3.) STATE AND LOCAL\n\nAt least states have had plenty of time to repair their budgets, right? Moody's looked at finances across the U.S. and found 23 are prepared for a moderate recession and another 10 are within striking distance. But 17 states are \"significantly unprepared for even a small downturn.\" Separate Labor Department data out early this year showed more than half of U.S. states lack enough unemployment funding to be prepared for another recession.\n\nFiscal stress at the state and local level can be particularly severe\u2014local governments can't start racking up more debt, so they either have to raise taxes or cut spending. Local government payrolls still haven't fully rebounded from the Great Recession.\n\nMORE FROM CHINA\n\nTwo Chinese initiatives worth noting:\n\nChina\u2019s private sector has become a weak link in a slowing economy. Now, authorities are rolling out tax breaks, bank loans and other financing options to bolster private businesses. The threat is that a declining private sector\u2014which accounts for more than half of China\u2019s economic output\u2014will rob the economy of vitality, with growth having slipped to 6.5% last quarter and projected to slow further, Chao Deng reports.\n\nThe trade dispute with the U.S. is giving Beijing fresh motivation to make the country\u2019s farms more efficient and lessen dependence on foreign growers. The trade-off: Chinese officials have long called for modernizing agriculture and consolidating farms, but Beijing also wants to maintain social stability. Large-scale mechanized farming would likely eliminate many jobs in rural areas, where resistance to change has been strong, Dominique Fong reports.\n\nLIBERT\u00e9, \u00c9GALIT\u00e9, FRATERNIT\u00e9\n\nFrance is preparing to fine companies that underpay women, a novel attempt to narrow the gender pay gap. Starting on Jan. 1, firms will be required under a new law to report how much they pay women compared with men, using a range of government-approved metrics. Companies with pay gaps will have three years to fix them or face a fine of up to 1% of their total payroll. The idea of policing pay equity is an unusually strict approach, even among countries that have turned up pressure on firms to bridge the divide, Noemie Bisserbe reports.\n\nTHANKS FOR MUTTON\n\nPrices of mutton and other sheep meat are hovering near record highs as more people around the world gain a taste for the strong-flavored red meat. Rising U.S. consumption in recent years coincides with rising demand in China, the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa. Sheep populations in Australia and New Zealand\u2014the world\u2019s largest producers and exporters of the meat\u2014on the other hand, have fallen to near their lowest levels in a century, Lucy Craymer reports.\n\nTWEET OF THE DAY\n\nUS-China relationship in APEC has been difficult for years now. But this is a new low. Statements are political, not technical, documents, so infinite scope for constructive ambiguity. Failure to issue one is a big deal. https://t.co/cCOQzlXHTi \u2014 Ben Shepherd (@BenShepherdEcon) November 18, 2018\n\nWHAT ELSE WE'RE READING\n\nThere aren't enough women in corporate leadership roles because there aren't enough women in corporate leadership roles. \"We find that women randomly assigned to male majority teams are less willing to become team leaders than women assigned to female majority teams. Analyses of potential mechanisms show that women in male majority teams are less confident in their relative performance, less influential, and more swayed by others in team discussions. They also (accurately) believe that they will receive less support from team members in a leadership election. Taken together, our results indicate that the absence of women in male dominated contexts may be a self-reinforcing process,\" Stockholm School of Economics' Andreas Born, University of Gothenburg's Eva Ranehill and Stockholm University's Anna Sandberg write.\n\nOregon in 2008 gave a group of uninsured low-income adults a chance to apply for Medicaid. \"We find that Medicaid increased voter turnout in the November 2008 Presidential election by about 7% overall, with the effects concentrated in men (18% increase) and in residents of democratic counties (10% increase); there is suggestive evidence that the increase in voting reflected new voter registrations, rather than increased turnout among pre-existing registrants,\" Katherine Baicker and Amy Finkelstein write in a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper.\n\nUP NEXT: TUESDAY\n\nBank of England Governor Mark Carney appears before parliament at 5 a.m. ET.\n\nU.S. housing starts for October, out at 8:30 a.m. ET, are expected to rise to an annual pace of 1.22 million from 1.201 million a month earlier.

However, that confidential report, parts of which were reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, underscores the dilemma GE faces as it chases new business in one of the few places with demand for its multimillion-dollar heavy duty gas turbines.\n\nThe study, prepared for GE this spring by corporate intelligence firm Hakluyt & Co., paints a portrait of widespread corruption and bribery in the Iraqi power sector, accusing high-ranking officials in the Ministry of Electricity, from which GE is currently vying with Siemens AG for $15 billion in new power contracts. Siemens declined to comment.\n\nThe Hakluyt report, based on interviews with business people and political officials working in the power sector, provides a broad overview of the corruption concerns in the industry and advises GE to distance itself from at least one of its contractors. Hakluyt\u2019s staff includes former British MI-6 officers andstrategic consultants from the business world.\n\nOne Iraqi government official is quoted in the report estimating that \u201cnot one single contract\u201d in a recent wave of power agreements \u201chas been done without some kind of deal benefiting one of the religious and political parties.\u201d\n\nThe study follows a previously unreported Justice Department inquiry into corruption allegations against GE employees in Iraq in April. That inquiry was triggered by a whistleblower complaint alleging employees of GE Power, the conglomerate\u2019s power unit, were involved in corruption, according to people familiar with the complaint.\n\nGE said it investigated the whistleblower accusation and found it to be without merit. The company learned of the whistleblower when U.S. agencies, including the departments of State and Commerce, withdrew their commercial support for the company\u2019s efforts in Iraq over the accusation. The embassy resumed its support for GE after the company agreed to investigate the allegation, the people familiar with the complaint said.\n\nThe status of the Justice Department\u2019s inquiry into the whistleblower\u2019s claims couldn\u2019t be determined. The Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nThe corruption concerns are an unwelcome headwind for GE\u2019s power business, its oldest and largest industrial unit, whose revenues and operating profit have plummeted over the past year, dragging GE\u2019s share price to historic lows. Management has said reversing the decline of the power business will take years. In the quarter ended Sept. 30, the power business recorded a $631 million loss, and took a $22 billion goodwill charge, writing down virtually all of the goodwill in the business.\n\nTies to bribery and corruption in foreign markets, even among third-party partners, could mean the possibility of violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act among other laws\u2014and millions of dollars in fines.\n\nThe company has \u201crobust processes for all kinds of ethics and compliance issues,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cWe believe that based on our review, the company hasn\u2019t committed any FCPA violations or violated any other laws.\u201d\n\nGE shares closed down 1.9% on Friday to close at $8.02, a roughly 45% fall over the past six months.\n\nThe report warned of corruption allegations against construction magnate Ali Shamara, a central figure in the Iraqi power sector, with whom the company has worked on multiple projectssince 2004, including a massive 2008 deal in which GE sold 56 9E turbines to the Iraqi Ministry of Electricity. Mr. Shamara\u2019s firm was contracted to install some of the units.\n\n\u201cAli Shamara earned his fortune largely through his relationship with former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki,\u201d Hakluyt said in its report. \u201cThis presents what is acknowledged by these contacts as a real dilemma: currently, any firm that completely avoids Ali Shamara will struggle to win major contracts from the (Ministry of Electricity), yet any firm that partners with him runs\u2014at the very least\u2014serious reputational risks.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, the report concedes that to win business in a market like Iraq, the company may have to do business with figures like Mr. Shamara.\n\nMr. Shamara\u2019s company \u201cremains essential\u201d to operating in the Iraqi power sector, the document said.\n\nMr. Shamara, in an interview, staunchly denied allegations of corruption on the part of himself and his firm, International Free Company, which is currently wrapping up its postconstruction work with GE on the rebuilding of a power plant called Baghdad South. He said he expected to continue to play a major role in Iraqi power projects, and hoped to work with GE in the future.\n\n\u201cWe had no corruption with GE,\u201d Mr. Shamara said. \u201cZero.\u201d\n\nGE said that its customer vetting process didn\u2019t raise any red flags about corruption in its past dealings with Mr. Shamara. The company also said it doesn\u2019t have any future projects scheduled with Mr. Shamara\u2019s companies or any plans to bid on future work with his companies.\n\nGE said its operations ensure its employees and business partners operate within the bounds of the law.\n\nHowever, one question debated within GE Power, according to people familiar with the matter, is why its dealings with Mr. Shamara had never raised concern. The company declined to comment on the reported debate.\n\nThe company said it hired Hakluyt to review its local network of contractors who install turbines and build out power plants as part of a broader internal review of its power business in the country. GE added it doesn\u2019t necessarily agree with the findings of consultants like Hakluyt, but the company views their findings as \u201cimportant input in our investigative process,\u201d a spokeswoman said.\n\nThe Hakluyt report quotes businessmen accusing officials in the Ministry of Electricity, including Deputy Minister Abdul Hamza Hadi Aboud, of demanding bribes before allowing power plant construction projects to go forward. Neither Mr. Aboud nor the Ministry of Electricity responded to requests for comment.\n\nIn a statement issued Monday after publication, new Iraqi Minister of Electricity Luay al-Khatteeb ordered the ministry\u2019s public prosecutor to investigate the allegations. The ministry said it would strive to stamp out corruption and refer offenders for prosecution.\n\nHakluyt also warned about a Turkish contracting firm with which GE has business in Iraq. Several senior Iraqi and Turkish politicians have said they believe it might be a front for the business interests of a senior official in Ankara, though Hakluyt couldn't independently confirm the politicians\u2019 statements, the report states.\n\n\u201cYou are probably on safer ground with your Turkish partner,\u201d the report said, adding, \u201cYou will also want to be realistic about the fact that any firms working in Iraq\u2014even Turkish ones\u2014are required to work through Iraqi partners.\u201d The Turkish company and the Turkish embassy didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe findings have caused concern at the highest levels of GE, and have been included in briefings for Chief Executive Larry Culp, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\u2014 Ali Nabhan, Ian Talley and Isabel Coles contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Ted Mann at ted.mann@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Peter Nicholas / Chuin-Wei Yap / Rob Taylor / Rachel Pannett", "title": "\u7f8e\u4e2d\u4ea4\u92d2APEC\uff0c\u8cbf\u6613\u548c\u9632\u52d9\u8b70\u984c\u9996\u7576\u5176\u6c96 - \u83ef\u723e\u8857\u65e5\u5831", "description": "\u83ef\u723e\u8857\u65e5\u5831 \u7f8e\u4e2d\u4ea4\u92d2APEC\uff0c\u8cbf\u6613\u548c\u9632\u52d9\u8b70\u984c\u9996\u7576\u5176\u6c96 \u83ef\u723e\u8857\u65e5\u5831 \u5728\u7f8e\u4e2d\u6bd4\u62fc\u570b\u969b\u5f71\u97ff\u529b\u4e4b\u969b\uff0c\u7f8e\u570b\u526f\u7e3d\u7d71\u5f6d\u65af(Mike Pence)\u548c\u4e2d\u570b\u570b\u5bb6\u4e3b\u5e2d\u7fd2\u8fd1\u5e73\u5c31\u4e9e\u592a\u5730\u5340\u8cbf\u6613\u548c\u9632\u52d9\u8b70\u984c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f7c\u6b64\u885d\u7a81\u7684\u9858\u666f\u3002 \u4e0a\u5468\u516d\u8207\u74b0\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u570b\u5bb6\u9818\u5c0e\u4eba\u6703\u6664\u6642\uff0c\u7fd2\u8fd1\u5e73\u63d0\u5230\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u4e16\u754c\u5927\u6230\u7684\u6158\u75db\u6559\u8a13\uff0c\u5c0d\u4e92\u76f8\u722d\u9b25\u548c\u55ae\u908a\u4e3b\u7fa9\u767c\u51fa\u8b66\u544a\uff0c\u800c\u5f6d\u65af\u5247\u62a8\u64ca...

Sports columnist Jason Gay (feckless football idiot) talked to Journal NFL correspondent Andrew Beaton (football boy genius) to preview the game. All expletives have been deleted, but any spelling mistakes are Beaton\u2019s fault.\n\nBeaton, we\u2019re so accustomed to Monday Night Football being a flaming garbage barge, but this match-up with the Rams and Chiefs\u2014is this the best game of the season so far? Tell me it is, because I don\u2019t want to hang out with my family.\n\nLet\u2019s take a deep breath and be calm and level headed about this... nevermind. This game is the future of the NFL. The two highest scoring teams in the league, with two young star quarterbacks and two innovative coaches. Flee your family. Better yet: Get them to watch!\n\nI say we talk Chiefs first. Were it not for 39-year-old Drew Brees turning back the clock, Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes\u2014playing his first full season\u2014would be a consensus MVP, yes?\n\nBrees is completing 77% of his passes. 77%! And what Mahomes is doing is still more mind-boggling. He is taking various records and mercilessly blasting them into smithereens with the rocket launcher attached to his torso. He\u2019s the moment in the videogame when you say, \u201cOkay, now it\u2019s unrealistic.\u201d He completed a critical pass lefty. Mahomes is a righty.\n\nMahomes\u2019s offensive options are crazy, too.\n\nTravis Kelce might be the NFL\u2019s best tight end. Tyreke Hill could be the most unguardable receiver. Kareem Hunt led the league in rushing last year\u2014as a rookie. The only thing crazier: the Rams\u2019 weapons might be even better.\n\nThe Rams have a 14-year-old coach. Isn\u2019t that a labor law issue?\n\nJason, I try to tell you this in the office everyday: Just because someone is younger than you doesn\u2019t make them 14! (Jason, who is 97, routinely refers to me as the Journal\u2019s 14-year-old football writer.) But the Rams\u2014they have a smart coach named Sean McVay who is actually 32, plus young stars at quarterback, Jared Goff, and running back, Todd Gurley. But they also have this revolutionary strategy where they believe in getting as many good players as possible. This off-season alone they added Ndamukong Suh, Marcus Peters, Aqib Talib and Brandin Cooks. If you don\u2019t know who they are, they\u2019re really good at football. And guess what: it\u2019s helped make the Rams really good at football.\n\nRams head coach Sean McVay was born in 1986. Photo: Joe Mahoney/Associated Press\n\nAre the defenses planning to attend Monday?\n\nWhat a quaint notion! Do you also want the teams to show up wearing leather helmets and run the wishbone? Vegas\u2019s expected point total for this game is 63.5\u2014the highest on record. That\u2019s despite the Rams having Aaron Donald, the reigning defensive MVP. There\u2019s nothing to expect but a wild shootout\u2026so naturally we\u2019ll all be scratching our heads after a stunning 12-7 snorefest, right?\n\nWe should probably note that this game was moved to L.A.\u2014it was originally a Mexico City game but that fell apart because the field there was damaged from a (checks notes) Shakira concert.\n\nShakira! Speaking of people we\u2019re shocked to see still making headlines in 2018: Let\u2019s take a moment to marvel at Andy Reid. He may be the most innovative mind in the entire league. He\u2019s 60 years old, in his 20th season as a head coach, and the Chiefs do so many funky things on offense that make you say, \u201cWow, never seen that before!\u201d\n\nBut you know what the rap is. We\u2019ve seen regular season Andy Reid juggernauts in the past\u2014only to watch them walk into the playoffs and fade like a toddler after 9 p.m. Why won\u2019t that happen again?\n\nBecause Reid has Mahomes. Do you know the last quarterback the Chiefs drafted who won a game for them before Mahomes? Todd Blackledge\u2026in 1983. Reid traded up to get Mahomes in the 2017 draft\u2014and took him with the 10th pick, and it seems crazy already that nine other teams passed on him\u2014and then shipped out Alex Smith, who, by the way led the NFL in passer rating a year ago, because he believed in Mahomes. I\u2019m done doubting the Walrus.\n\nSpeaking of which, can we have a moment here for Alex Smith? That leg injury was terrible.\n\nGruesome. And 33 years to the date after Joe Theismann\u2019s injury.\n\nWho could get the Chiefs in the AFC? Pittsburgh had been impressive\u2014then struggled to beat the free-falling Jaguars Sunday, so who knows. New England gave K.C. their one L, but that was in Foxborough, and the Pats have looked wobbly. I know you laugh when I say the Pats look wobbly.\n\nHAHAHAHA. That\u2019s me laughing at the suggestion the Patriots look wobbly. And I agree about the Steelers\u2014I thought they were better than what we saw Sunday. But let\u2019s talk about two AFC teams that aren\u2019t being talked about nearly enough. The Chargers are 7-3 and, at 36 years old, Philip Rivers is playing some of the best football of his career. Meanwhile, the Texans have rattled off seven straight wins and are 7-3. Their young quarterback, Deshaun Watson, has been overshadowed by Mahomes this season, but he\u2019s been low-key fantastic.\n\nAnd the NFC? The Rams are good, but the Saints have already beaten them, the Bears and Panthers can be handfuls, and then there is a whole slew of .500 or so teams priming to be December spoilers. Who is your dark horse for the NFC?\n\nIs it fair to call the Vikings a dark horse? It has been a slightly strange season for Minnesota. It entered the season as a heavyweight, after having reached last year\u2019s NFC Championship Game, and then signing Kirk Cousins. But they have slid into the background with all the amazing things happening with the Rams and Saints. Are you going to call me lame for picking a team that was a Super Bowl favorite before the season? Fine, I know. Lame.\n\nNo it\u2019s a fair point. I\u2019m a doofus for forgetting the Vikes. Hey: we have a new MNF crew this year. Thoughts? My feeling is: get Booger out of that magic spaceship chair and into the booth.\n\nBooger\u2019s chair was an innovation that comically devolved into a thorny topic because it was blocking the views of fans. But his commentary? Great. You\u2019re right: get him into the booth.\n\nCondoleezza Rice to the Browns? Anything is possible in Cleveland. Photo: Amy Sancetta/Associated Press\n\nDo you have an opinion about the Browns wanting to (checks notes again) interview Condoleezza Rice for their head coaching job, as ESPN reported Sunday morning?\n\nFootball is always described in militaristic terms: blitzes, battles in the trenches, bombs down field. So let\u2019s get a former National Security Advisor and Secretary of State in the post. It would either prove to be brilliant or fail spectacularly in the most Browns-ian way possible. Either way, I\u2019m in.\n\nAs long as Dick Cheney is GM. Can I get a Monday prediction from you?\n\n34-28 Rams. But here\u2019s a kookier question: How many punts will there be all game?\n\nWhat\u2019s a punt, Beaton?\n\nWhen you do a Q&A with me for your Monday column.
