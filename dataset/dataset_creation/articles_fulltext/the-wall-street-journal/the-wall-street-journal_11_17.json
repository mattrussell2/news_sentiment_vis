CEO James Brett is leaving after about 16 months on the job, following disagreements with the company\u2019s longtime leader, Millard \u201cMickey\u201d Drexler, about strategy and board concerns about his spending plans, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nDespite recent improvements in J.Crew\u2019s sales, Mr. Drexler didn\u2019t agree with Mr. Brett\u2019s decisions to sell some apparel on Amazon.com Inc. and expand the assortment, two of the people said. They said Mr. Drexler felt such moves were cheapening the brand, which he built into a preppy status symbol, though J.Crew has struggled in recent years with falling sales.\n\nThe retailer\u2019s board, which includes its private-equity backers TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners, had its own concerns with operational decisions, including Mr. Brett\u2019s spending plans, another person said.\n\nIn recent weeks, the company had a heated board meeting in which members clashed with Mr. Brett over his decision to start a new brand called Nevereven and expand J.Crew\u2019s Mercantile budget line as its own brand, the people said. They also raised concerns over operating earnings, these people said. Mr. Brett held his ground and offered to part ways, they said.\n\nMr. Brett, a retail veteran who previously led furniture chain West Elm, was hired last summer amid a yearslong sales slump when Mr. Drexler stepped aside after more than a decade as CEO.\n\nMr. Brett didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for J.Crew Group declined to comment.\n\nThe company said Saturday the departure was by mutual agreement. In a news release, Mr. Brett said he and the company\u2019s board, which includes Mr. Drexler as chairman, were \u201cunable to bridge our beliefs\u201d on the company\u2019s strategy.\n\nMr. Brett\u2019s departure leaves the fashion retailer without a leader in the midst of an effort to revive its fortunes and heading into the critical holiday season. In August, the J.Crew brand snapped a four-year slump, posting a slight gain in quarterly sales at its existing stores and websites.\n\nMr. Brett\u2019s strategy was to expand J.Crew\u2019s assortment with more entry-level prices, as well as plus sizes and more fit options. He also struck deals to sell some items on Amazon.com and other retailers in a bid to reach shoppers across the globe.\n\nIn an August interview, Mr. Brett said he hadn\u2019t met resistance from the private-equity firms or Mr. Drexler. \u201cIf I fail, I\u2019ll have failed by my own hands,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the time, TPG co-founder and J.Crew director James Coulter said he supported Mr. Brett\u2019s vision. He is \u201ccharting a course for the next generation of an iconic brand,\u201d Mr. Coulter said. TPG declined to make Mr. Coulter available for comment on Saturday.\n\nThe unprofitable company, which had $1.13 billion in revenue in the first half of its fiscal year, is carrying about $1.7 billion of debt after Mr. Drexler took it private in a 2011 leveraged buyout with TPG and Leonard Green.\n\nThe company\u2019s new assortment was gaining traction with some customers. Comparable sales, which include online sales, increased 1% at the J.Crew brand in the second quarter from the year-earlier period. Companywide comparable sales rose 5%, boosted by the smaller brand Madewell, which jumped 28%. It had a quarterly net loss of $6.1 million, compared with a loss of $18.5 million a year ago.\n\nIn some ways, Mr. Brett\u2019s strategy was a reversal from Mr. Drexler\u2019s vision for J.Crew, with a distinct aesthetic and controlled distribution. At a media conference last year, Mr. Drexler also said he wouldn\u2019t sell on Amazon. \u201cNumber one, they own the customer,\u201d he said, adding that Amazon would \u201ctake every best seller and put it into their private-label collection.\u201d\n\nAfter Mr. Drexler resigned as CEO in early 2017, he stayed on as chairman and remained in communication with some J.Crew executives, which was a source of tension with Mr. Brett, one of the people said.\n\nIn Saturday\u2019s news release, a statement attributed to the \u201cboard of directors\u201d thanked Mr. Brett for positioning the company for long-term success and said it would build on his progress.\n\nThe company said Mr. Brett\u2019s duties would be assumed by four current executives, which will form an \u201cOffice of the CEO\u201d while the board establishes \u201ca permanent management structure.\u201d\n\nWrite to Khadeeja Safdar at khadeeja.safdar@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Vivian Salama", "title": "Trump Indicates Government Shutdown Still in Play - Wall Street Journal", "description": "Wall Street Journal Trump Indicates Government Shutdown Still in Play Wall Street Journal WASHINGTON\u2014President Trump indicated Saturday that a partial government shutdown next month remains on the table as leverage to secure $5 billion in funding from Congres\u2026", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-indicates-government-shutdown-still-in-play-1542493031", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37713/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T22:18:26Z", "content": "WASHINGTON -- President Trump indicated Saturday that a partial government shutdown next month remains on the table as leverage to secure $5 billion in funding from Congress for his border wall.

Its catalog of supermodels in lacy push-up bras and its annual fashion show were the stuff of fantasies. Now the brand selling sexiness\u2014or, at least, a particular vision of sexiness\u2014has lost its appeal.\n\nShares of L Brands , LB 2.04% whose main businesses are Victoria\u2019s Secret and Bath & Body Works, are down 41% this year. That is primarily due to slowing sales at Victoria\u2019s Secret, particularly of bras, which make up 35% of L Brands\u2019s sales. In July, Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s semiannual sale was so weak the retailer was forced to extend it by two weeks and offer steeper discounts, leading analysts to declare the brand broken.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Victoria\u2019s Secret CEO Jan Singer is leaving.\n\nThe crux of the problem is that women are looking for a different kind of underwear and a different set of values. Instead of $60 padded bras that sell male fantasies, they are opting for cheaper undergarments that prioritize their own comfort. Victoria\u2019s Secret has tried to adapt with the times, ending its catalog, doubling down on sports bras and even releasing a collection of \u201cbralettes\u201d\u2014bras without underwire and padding.\n\nIt is a late adopter of the trend, however. The lingerie brand Aerie at American Eagle Outfitters got an early start selling bralettes. A host of online startups, like ThirdLove, are also gaining market share with underwear that caters to different body shapes and emphasizes ease and fit over glamour.\n\nThe style differences have been accompanied by a radical change in marketing. Aerie made a campaign out of its decision to stop retouching photos, called #AerieReal. ThirdLove features women of all ages, races and body types.\n\nVictoria\u2019s Secret has tried to make the transition\u2014for instance, by marketing its bralettes with the slogan, \u201cNo padding is sexy\u201d\u2014but a brand built on artifice doesn\u2019t sell in an atmosphere that prizes authenticity.\n\nAs Jefferies analyst Randal Konik wrote in a note to investors after the departure of Ms. Singer, \u201cThe problem is the brand is not resonating with consumers, its pricing power is gone, its market share is under permanent attack, and the business is over-stored.\u201d\n\nRelated Video The retail industry is undergoing another major shift -- to e-commerce. How did we get here? Photo: Associated Press\n\nLast year, ratings for the Victoria\u2019s Secret fashion show plunged 30% among 18 to 49 year-olds. (\u201cRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\u201d which ran on the same network that evening, performed much better.) It is a safe bet that this year\u2019s show, which will air on Dec. 2, will meet a similar fate. Chief marketing officer Ed Razek recently drew a backlash when he said the fashion show should not include transgender models since it is supposed to be \u201ca fantasy.\u201d (Criticism on social media prompted him to retract the statement.)\n\nL Brands, which reports third-quarter earnings after the market close on Monday, saw some recovery in its stock after releasing October sales that showed a 4% comparable-sales increase over the same period last year. But that was mostly due to 11% sales growth at Bath & Body Works; Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s sales were flat.\n\nStrong brands like Victoria\u2019s Secret can be powerful forces, but when times change, that sharp sense of identity can make it harder to evolve. Combined with consumers deserting malls, where the retailer is heavily exposed, that means sales will likely keep dropping.\n\nVictoria\u2019s Secret can keep fantasizing. But that won\u2019t be enough to win women, or investors, back."}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Jason Douglas", "title": "U.K.'s Window Into a Less Globalized Economy", "description": "The U.K. economy has so far weathered the political storm surrounding Brexit pretty well.

But beneath the surface, there are harbingers of economic costs to come.\n\nResearchers at the Centre for European Reform, a London think tank focused on European Union policy, estimate the economy was 2.5% smaller at the end of the second quarter than it would have been had voters chosen in 2016 to stay in the EU.\n\nGrowth in the U.K. slowed after the referendum as economies such as the U.S., France and Germany kicked into higher gear, a reflection of subdued investment and a squeeze on consumer wallets from a burst of inflation. In 2017, only Italy turned in a weaker performance among Group of Seven economies.\n\nInvestors are wary. In dollar terms, the FTSE 250, a better barometer of domestic companies than the globally focused FTSE 100, is down 8% since Britons voted to leave the EU in 2016. France\u2019s main index is up 12% over the same period, and Germany\u2019s has gained 10%.\n\nStill, the unemployment rate in Britain is close to a record low, while wage growth has picked up to its fastest pace in a decade. A once-yawning trade deficit has shrunk. A persistent budget shortfall has been whittled down through years of belt-tightening, allowing Treasury chief Philip Hammond to cut taxes and pump extra cash into hospitals. The Bank of England has begun gently nudging up borrowing costs. While Germany\u2019s economy contracted in the third quarter, the U.K.\u2019s expanded at a 2.5% annual rate.\n\nAll are signs of an economy making steady, if unspectacular, progress after the long climb out of post-financial-crisis doldrums\u2014albeit less progress than might have been expected had the Brexit referendum gone the other way.\n\n\u201cWe are in a reasonably healthy place,\u201d said Peter Dixon, senior economist at Commerzbank in London.\n\nThe economy\u2019s future prospects hinge on the shape of the Brexit deal Prime Minister Theresa Mayis able to negotiate with the EU. A draft agreement between London and Brussels over the terms of Britain\u2019s withdrawal, which didn\u2019t cover in detail its future economic ties to the EU, sparked a fresh bout of political turmoil in London last week and new doubts about whether Mrs. May can get her plan through Parliament. She faces opposition from Brexit supporters who want a cleaner break with the EU and pro-EU lawmakers who want closer ties.\n\nMrs. May\u2019s domestic travails mean an abrupt and messy break with the EU when the clock runs down on Brexit talks in March remains a real possibility. Such an outcome would leave the U.K. facing significant tariffs and regulatory hurdles with a bloc that accounts for half its trade.\n\nThe short-term consequences could include severe disruption to everyday economic activity when the U.K. exits the EU\u2019s legal regime. Lawmakers worry ports might gum up or flights may get canceled. Central-bank officials warn of an economic shock akin to the oil crises of the 1970s or, ironically, the blow to New Zealand in 1973 when the U.K. joined what would become the EU, undermining New Zealand\u2019s position in its major export market.\n\nLonger-term, a no-deal scenario would leave the British economy as much as 8% smaller by 2030 than it would have been had Brexit never happened, the International Monetary Fund estimates.\n\nYet even if Brexit goes smoothly, the consequences for the British economy are broad and deep, with some early tremors already being felt.\n\nEconomists believe Brexit has hurt the U.K. economy\u2019s capacity to produce goods and services without stoking inflation. The BOE estimates the economy\u2019s speed limit has dwindled to around 1.5% a year, from a historical rate closer to 2.5%.\n\nTwo big factors power growth in an economy\u2019s potential supply, and Brexit affects both. One is growth in the labor force, and the second is productivity.\n\nBritons voted to leave the European Union in part to cut migration, which had helped labor supply grow around 1.2% a year in the run-up to the Brexit vote. The BOE now expects labor supply to grow 0.4% a year as EU workers decide to go elsewhere. That helps to hold the unemployment rate down but impedes the economic growth rate.\n\nBritain\u2019s statistics office said last week that the number of EU nationals employed in the U.K. fell by 132,000 in the year through September, the largest fall since records began in 1997, a sign that trend is already taking shape.\n\nBOE Gov. Mark Carney has described Brexit as a process of economic adjustment that will play out for years to come, as companies reorder their supply chains and find new customers outside the EU. Whole industries could shrink, while others expand, economists say, as the economy slowly adapts to new, post-Brexit trading relationships.\n\nSuch a shift has knock-on effects for the productivity of workers. Productivity growth in the U.K. is weak relative to other advanced economies, and that long Brexit reorientation could weigh on it further by crimping trade and investment. The U.K. in 2015 attracted a quarter of all foreign investment in new capacity to produce goods and services arriving in the whole EU. By 2017 that had fallen to 18%, according to a recent analysis by the University of Sussex.\n\n\u201cWe are unraveling relationships we\u2019ve had for 40 years,\u201d said David Owen, chief European economist at Jefferies. \u201cRipping it up and moving on\u2014it\u2019s going to take years.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Vivian Salama", "title": "Trump Calls for Better Forest Management During California Visit - Wall Street Journal", "description": "Wall Street Journal Trump Calls for Better Forest Management During California Visit Wall Street Journal President Trump toured the devastation caused by the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California's history and said he would press for better fo\u2026", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-california-leaders-to-discuss-wildfire-prevention-1542473923", "urlToImage": "https://images.wsj.net/im-37706/social", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T21:38:00Z", "content": "President Trump toured the devastation caused by the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in Californias history and said he would press for better forest management to prevent future infernos.

In turn, their monthly $10.99 payments would subsidize movies and awards campaigns for years to come.\n\nNetflix bought distribution rights to \u201cRoma\u201d after Mr. Cuar\u00f3n and Participant Media, which financed the budget of about $15 million, screened 10 minutes of footage for potential buyers. Executives from traditional studios were quick to point out the film\u2019s commercial drawbacks.\n\n\u201cWe love the film. We all cried,\u201d Mr. Cuar\u00f3n said the executives would tell him and his associates, before launching into the liabilities. \u201cIt\u2019s in Spanish. With nonactors. In black-and-white.\u201d\n\nNetflix didn\u2019t voice such concerns, said Mr. Cuar\u00f3n. But its longstanding refusal to grant movies an exclusive theatrical release presented a problem for a director known for big-screen spectacle like the long tracking shots of his dystopian thriller \u201cChildren of Men\u201d or the outer-space special effects of \u201cGravity,\u201d for which he won the best-director Oscar in 2014. And a straight-to-Netflix release would likely alienate Academy members who remain purists about only awarding films with a major theatrical rollout, not just those that receive a qualifying run in at least one Los Angeles theater.\n\nNetflix\u2019s initial conversations with Mr. Cuar\u00f3n guaranteed some kind of theatrical treatment for \u201cRoma.\u201d That proved easier said than done.\n\nNetflix\u2019s chief content officer Ted Sarandos, left, with \u2018Roma\u2019 director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n at the Telluride Film Festival last August. Photo: Getty Images\n\nMajor U.S. theater chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and Cinemark Holdings have consistently avoided showing movies that open around the same time as their streaming release. That left Netflix with only a handful of independent cinemas to show \u201cRoma.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a token release, a little gesture to play in cinemas for a little while and get awards,\u201d said John Fithian, president of the National Association of Theatre Owners, the exhibitors\u2019 main lobbying group.\n\nNetflix appears determined to get as many people to watch \u201cRoma\u201d on the big screen as possible. It has taken \u201cRoma\u201d to film festivals all over the world, from Cairo to Toronto, Key West to Tokyo and Scottsdale to Mumbai.\n\nThough the film explores the private life of a young woman living with an upper-middle-class family, \u201cRoma\u201d features scenes of cinematic spectacle: Long shots featuring a human cannonball, dozens of young men in choreographed martial-arts exercises, a sequence featuring hundreds of student protesters storming the streets of Mexico City.\n\nYalitza Aparicio plays Cleo, a young woman in 1970s Mexico City in \u2018Roma.\u2019 Photo: Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n/Netflix\n\nMr. Cuar\u00f3n, for his part, thinks the best way to see it is in a theater, too. \u201cThe cinema experience and theatergoing experience is still the ultimate experience,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he can hardly get his own children to the theater to see a movie, he said, \u201cno matter how much I beg.\u201d The Netflix rollout of \u201cRoma,\u201d he said, is a compromise.\n\n\u201cThe two models, they can coexist,\u201d Mr. Cuar\u00f3n said.\n\nNetflix is learning just what winning the best-picture Oscar entails. The awards season in Hollywood has stretched into six months of schmoozing, coordinated by strategists who know how to glad-hand every Academy member and craft a narrative around why their client is the most deserving winner.\n\nIn July, Netflix signaled to Hollywood that it was in the awards game for good, acquiring a prominent awards-consulting firm that has helped numerous movies win a raft of Oscars.\n\nThe firm, LT-LA, is run by veteran strategist Lisa Taback, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of awards-campaign guru Harvey Weinstein who is known throughout the industry for an encyclopedic understanding of the dinners, cocktail parties and baby-kissing that build a successful voter-charming campaign. She has led campaigns for movies like \u201cLa La Land\u201d (14 nominations, six wins), \u201cSpotlight\u201d (six nominations, two wins) and \u201cChicago\u201d (12 nominations, six wins).\n\nWhile \u201cRoma\u201d may be Ms. Taback\u2019s first big test at Netflix, it\u2019s one she\u2019ll soon face again. Martin Scorsese is in production now on \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d a Netflix mob thriller starring Robert De Niro that many in Hollywood suspect will also try for a theatrical release and awards consideration.\n\nNetflix won\u2019t report box-office figures for the \u201cRoma\u201d limited release, leading some competing studios to complain that it\u2019s gaining the public-relations advantages of a theatrical release without the potential liabilities. Universal\u2019s \u201cFirst Man,\u201d for instance, has seen its awards momentum slow among pundits since it underperformed at the box office. (Universal declined to comment.)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be their message: We sent it to theaters like you wanted,\u201d griped one rival awards campaigner.\n\nSome Academy members may be warming to streamers. At 81 years old and with two Oscars for best editing (\u201cWho Framed Roger Rabbit,\u201d \u201cForrest Gump\u201d), Arthur Schmidt might seem like the kind of Academy constituent not interested in the Netflix model. But the Santa Barbara, Calif., retiree said watching on the streaming service isn\u2019t much different than watching the DVD \u201cscreeners\u201d of awards hopefuls that studios send every year.\n\n\u201cI would prefer to see it in the cinema because it\u2019s the dark cinema and it\u2019s a commitment,\u201d said Mr. Schmidt. \u201cBut for so many years we\u2019ve been getting the DVDs and that\u2019s been a wonderful convenience.\u201d\n\nMr. Cuar\u00f3n himself has mixed feelings about the obsession with awards. Speaking at a press conference last year following the production wrap of \u201cRoma,\u201d he said Hollywood overthinks the prize.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t give it more importance than it deserves,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Erich Schwartzel at erich.schwartzel@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Ellen Gamerman", "title": "The Movies to See This Holiday Season", "description": "Wondering what movies to see this holiday season?

Ms. Roberts, as his mother, opens the film looking saintly under the stained-glass windows of a church. She becomes ensnared in his lies as they search for their dog, stolen by a drug dealer, while Ben attempts to redeem himself from his past mistakes.\n\nPeter Hedges said he comes from a family that has grappled with alcohol and drug addiction and those struggles helped inform his script. \u201cThe idea was to tell the story about one family over the course of one day,\u201d he said, \u201cand try to show as many aspects of what a family dealing with this horrible disease may go through.\u201d\n\nFrom left, Ian Hart, Jack Lowden, Saoirse Ronan and James McArdle in \u2018Mary Queen of Scots.\u2019 Photo: Focus Features\n\n\u2018Mary Queen of Scots\u2019\n\nOpens Dec. 7\n\nThe 16th-century power struggle between Mary Stuart and her cousin Queen Elizabeth I\u2014and the men surrounding them\u2014ends badly for Mary. (To avoid spoilers, let\u2019s just say her fate rhymes with shmecapitation.)\n\nIn \u201cMary Queen of Scots,\u201d Saoirse Ronan infuses Mary\u2019s last moments with drama, revealing a blood-red dress underneath her black cloak en route to her own execution.\n\n\u201cMary knew that it would be very memorable and it would make the headlines, as it were, to be seen as a martyr,\u201d Ms. Ronan said. \u201cOne of the things the film really showcases is image and how strong imagery can be. She used that to her advantage until the very end.\u201d\n\nThe film pairs Academy Award nominees Ms. Ronan and Margot Robbie as an increasingly ravaged Queen Elizabeth. When the women finally meet, Ms. Robbie\u2019s queen is bald under a garish wig with a thick white paste on her face to hide her smallpox scars. \u201cMary Queen of Scots\u201d is the first feature from British theater director Josie Rourke, with an adapted screenplay from Netflix \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d creator Beau Willimon.\n\nStephan James and KiKi Layne in \u2018If Beale Street Could Talk.\u2019 Photo: Annapurna Pictures\n\n\u2018If Beale Street Could Talk\u2019\n\nOpens Dec. 14\n\nBarry Jenkins\u2019s first film since his drama \u201cMoonlight\u201d won the 2017 best-picture Oscar tells the story of Fonny (Stephan James), who is wrongfully imprisoned, and his pregnant fianc\u00e9e Tish (screen newcomer KiKi Layne). The love story is adapted from a 1974 novel by James Baldwin.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something almost politically engaged and just doubly impactful in seeing two young dark-skinned leads in a very pure romantic depiction such as this,\u201d said Mr. Jenkins, who hopes \u201cBeale Street\u201d paves the way for more adaptations of African-American literature.\n\nAfter immersing himself in the novel and getting to know the late author\u2019s family over more than five years, Mr. Jenkins dedicated his film to Mr. Baldwin. By that point, the formalities were gone.\n\n\u201cHaving been devoured in this material,\u201d he said, \u201cI felt comfortable referring to him as Jimmy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Mule\u201d trailer\n\n\u2018The Mule\u2019\n\nOpens Dec. 14\n\nClint Eastwood has a tendency to release Oscar contenders right at the end of the year: \u201cMillion Dollar Baby,\u201d \u201cGran Torino\u201d and \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d are a few examples. His latest December surprise is \u201cThe Mule,\u201d inspired by a New York Times article about a 90-year-old man caught in a cocaine sting.\n\nMr. Eastwood directs and stars as the hard-up Earl Stone, who unwittingly takes a job as a driver for a drug cartel. He is pursued by a federal agent (Bradley Cooper) and haunted by guilt over his shortcomings as a father and husband. \u201cI put work in front of family,\u201d the 88-year-old actor says in the trailer. \u201cI thought it was more important to be somebody out there than to be the failure I was in my own home.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u201d trailer\n\n\u2018Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u2019\n\nOpens Dec. 14\n\nIt took more than a year to get the first three test shots just right for this movie, one of the first major Hollywood releases to combine hand-drawn animation with computer-generated imagery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cinematic expression of a comic book,\u201d said Bob Persichetti, one of its three directors. \u201cThat sounds good as a tag, but when you try to make it work, it becomes really complicated.\u201d\n\nThis Spider-Man chapter focuses on a version of the superhero unknown to casual viewers but found in the comic books. As Spider-Man, a Brooklyn teenager named Miles Morales fights bad guys with a team of Spideys from other periods, including the porcine Spider-Ham.\n\nMr. Persichetti wants to reach a broad audience but has a message for the diehards. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe treated this with as much reverence as we could because we\u2019re fans, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d trailer\n\n\u2018Mary Poppins Returns\u2019\n\nOpens Dec. 19\n\nA lot can go wrong when tinkering with a prized possession in the Disney archive. \u201cThe bar was impossibly high,\u201d said director Rob Marshall. \u201cMary Poppins can\u2019t sing \u2018Let It Go.\u2019 \u201d\n\nStarring Emily Blunt in the title role and featuring a Cockney-accented Lin-Manuel Miranda, the movie is set in the 1930s, more than two decades after the first story. Siblings Jane and Michael Banks are about to lose the family house at 17 Cherry Tree Lane, where recently widowed Michael still lives with his three young children.\n\nTo step into Julie Andrews\u2019s kitten heels, Ms. Blunt went back to the children\u2019s books by P.L. Travers, where she found a governess filled with contradictions\u2014selfless and vain, empathetic and rude, practical and screwball.\n\nThe sequel includes a live action and cartoon sequence with entirely hand-drawn animation like the first film. Dick Van Dyke, a star of the original, makes a cameo. The movie features original songs, though none by \u201cHamilton\u201d creator Mr. Miranda.\n\nMr. Marshall, whose past screen musicals include \u201cChicago\u201d and \u201cInto the Woods,\u201d adds modern touches, like BMX bike riders doing stunts across pre-war London.\n\n\u201cAquaman\u201d trailer\n\n\u2018Aquaman\u2019\n\nOpens Dec. 21\n\nAquaman, the DC superhero used to being a punchline (\u201cSuper Friends,\u201d \u201cEntourage\u201d), makes a play for legitimacy with a big-screen movie starring the muscle-bound and man-bunned \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Jason Momoa.\n\nDirector James Wan said he wanted to change Aquaman\u2019s reputation by \u201ctaking a somewhat classic underdog character that people make fun of in pop culture and then make a non-jokey version of that.\u201d\n\nThe film is set in the ocean world but also travels to the Sahara desert, a Sicilian coastal town and a beach with small dinosaurs. Mr. Wan created rules for his water world, such as eliminating bubbles when characters speak and lighting the depths with glowing jellyfish. Also in the offing: a giant octopus playing drums, Mr. Momoa emerging from a waterfall in slow motion and Willem Dafoe with dyed eyebrows, riding an enormous hammerhead shark.\n\nFelicity Jones stars as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in \u2018On the Basis of Sex.\u2019 Photo: Focus Features\n\n\u2018On the Basis of Sex\u2019\n\nOpens Dec. 25\n\nThe unofficial RBG franchise that has energized young women and turned Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburginto a pop-culture phenomenon now includes a feature film.\n\nBritish actress Felicity Jones plays Justice Ginsburg with a heavy New York accent, opposite Armie Hammer as a hunky Marty Ginsburg. The movie is inspired by a 1970s case the two argued about sex discrimination against a man, a fight that helped open the door to women\u2019s-rights litigation. The 85-year-old justice gave her blessing for the film, written by her nephew and first-time screenwriter Daniel Stiepleman.\n\nIn trying to draw out Justice Ginsburg\u2019s human side, director Mimi Leder (HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d) included a bedroom scene, though she said the final cut turned out less racy than earlier versions. At a screening attended by Justice Ginsburg, the director said, one viewer complained that the love scene was too much. \u201cI said, \u2018You should\u2019ve seen it before,\u2019\u201d Ms. Leder said. \u201cAll eyes went to Justice Ginsburg. She looked up and she said, \u2018I\u2019m fine with it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nChristian Bale as Dick Cheney and Amy Adams as Lynne Cheney in \u2018Vice.\u2019 Photo: Annapurna Pictures\n\n\u2018Vice\u2019\n\nOpens Dec. 25\n\nChristian Bale makes a total physical transformation into Dick Cheney, whose rise to power as George W. Bush\u2019s vice president is the subject of this biopic. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d said director Adam McKay. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s playing him, it\u2019s like he summoned him.\u201d\n\nThe film costars Sam Rockwell as Mr. Bush, Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld and Amy Adams as Lynne Cheney. A roster of Bush-era regulars fills out the cast, including Tyler Perry in a dead-on portrayal of Colin Powell.\n\nMr. McKay, who won the 2016 adapted-screenplay Oscar for \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d wrote the script for \u201cVice\u201d as well. He got the idea a few years ago while reading a Cheney biography as he battled the flu. \u201cIt seems to me that Dick Cheney is almost like a Zelig figure in the middle of American history,\u201d Mr. McKay said, \u201cfrom the 1960s on to the end, when he finally got to put his hands on the captain\u2019s wheel and got to steer history for a while.\u201d\n\nWrite to Ellen Gamerman at ellen.gamerman@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Paul Berger", "title": "In New York City, a Helipad Is a Prime Perk", "description": "When Amazon.com agreed to build its second headquarters in Queens, it not only got $3 billion in incentives from New York, but one of the rarest perks in the Big Apple: a helipad.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-new-york-city-a-helipad-is-a-prime-perk-1542463201", "urlToImage": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-CK145_NYHELI_SOC_20181115174246.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T14:00:03Z", "content": "When Amazon.com Inc. agreed to build its second headquarters in Queens, it not only got $3 billion in incentives from New York, but one of the rarest perks in the Big Apple: a helipad.

The footage they saw, from this month\u2019s animated feature \u201cRalph Breaks the Internet,\u201d revealed the princesses as everyday young women, on break from their jobs as Disney royalty.\n\nElsa and Sleeping Beauty have their hair down and wear pajamas. Snow White shows off her Coke-bottle glasses. Cinderella shatters her glass slipper and thrusts it forward like a broken bottle at a girl who walks into the room. Rapunzel asks her, \u201cDo people assume all your problems get solved because a big, strong man showed up?\u201d\n\nDisney's new movie \u2018Ralph Breaks the Internet\u2019 depicts the princesses as normal young women. Photo: Disney\n\n\u201cEveryone audibly gasped,\u201d according to a person present. In their eyes, the scene broke all of the Disney rules that had built the princesses into a lucrative brand.\n\nFor nearly 20 years, Disney employees have debated how far the company should go in updating its heroines for the modern age. The crux: How do you keep princesses relevant without alienating fans who hold fast to the versions they grew up with? Billions of dollars of revenue\u2014dolls, sequels, stage shows and dresses\u2014hang on getting that balance right.\n\nSince \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d in 1937, the princess characters have trained generations of young moviegoers on men, women, relationships and love. The franchise, especially its older films, has been criticized for promoting outdated notions of femininity and damsel-in-distress narratives in which only a man can save the day.\n\nParents are wrestling with the messages the stories send their children\u2014is it acceptable for the prince to kiss Sleeping Beauty, given she\u2019s sleeping? The tension has grown more pronounced in an era of female presidential candidates, women\u2019s marches and #MeToo.\n\nDisney develops and manages characters such as Mulan or Rapunzel similar to the way Apple Inc. handles new iPhone models, with a secretive process that allows the princesses to debut in public fully formed. Interviews with nearly two dozen current and former employees working across Disney\u2019s sprawling princess operations reveal a perennial push-and-pull over getting the mix of tradition and modernity right, from producing remakes and merchandise built around longtime characters to introducing new characters.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve tried to make the princesses more independent and to have more of a voice, but at the same time there\u2019s a recognition that there\u2019s also an appeal\u2014even if it\u2019s not as modern\u2014to pretty dresses and beautiful castles,\u201d said one former Disney executive.\n\nDisney declined to make executives available for an interview.\n\nMore than 80 years after \u201cSnow White\u201d hit theaters, Disney still sells figurines, Grumpy costumes and themed Play-Doh sets. \u201cFrozen\u201d has become one of Disney\u2019s greatest hits, spawning a sequel, a Broadway adaptation and countless \u201cLet It Go\u201d downloads since it hit theaters five years ago. The live-action remake of \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d collected $1.26 billion at the global box office in 2017.\n\nSkillful or Beautiful?

Hundred-page manifestos outlining the colors, language and attitude that licensees and designers should use for each princess are treated as gospel. Data is mined from sources ranging from academic studies to toddler focus groups at the company\u2019s campus in Burbank, Calif.\n\nThe characters have grown more complex over the years. That hasn\u2019t prevented debates from forming in recent years over princess outfits, live-action updates and the word \u201cprincess\u201d itself.\n\n\u201cNo matter how hard you try, a 4-year-old girl is going to want to be a Little Mermaid,\u201d said one former Disney executive. \u201cBut if they try to make Ariel into a lawyer, there\u2019s going to be a huge backlash.\u201d\n\nDisney\u2019s efforts must resonate with consumers like Lesley Godbey, a 31-year-old mother of two in San Diego.\n\nMs. Godbey\u2019s daughters worship the Disney princesses, much like she did growing up with Ariel and Belle in the 1990s. She even dresses as Belle at fan conventions, posing for photos in the character\u2019s signature canary-yellow dress.\n\nWhen she\u2019s reading princess stories to her daughters, she also wants them to know there\u2019s more to life than the fairy-tale telling, so she has taught them a call-and-response.\n\nIf a story ends with \u201cAnd they lived happily ever after,\u201d her daughters chime in, \u201cwith lots of hard work and open communication!\u201d\n\nAfter the \u201cRalph Breaks the Internet\u201d screening, executives worried that too many toys and apparel around the edgier version of the princesses could overshadow the traditional representations, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nPrincess dolls for sale at the Central Children's Store in Moscow. Photo: Sharifulin Valery/ZUMA PRESS\n\nRetailers expressed interest in princess dolls and clothes pegged to the \u201cRalph\u201d release, this person said. Disney put together some merchandise, including a doll set featuring the princesses in everyday clothes as well as shirts for young girls modeled after the princesses\u2019 pajamas. After fans embraced the scene, some Disney executives questioned why they hadn\u2019t pushed even more product around it.\n\nThe movie\u2019s filmmakers had a crucial ally for the updated portrayal: former chief creative officer John Lasseter, who had long wanted to bring the princesses down to earth, colleagues say. Mr. Lasseter had received approval and support for the scene from Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger, the CEO, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cIf I were to make the movies you guys wanted me to make about princesses, I would be murdered,\u201d Mr. Lasseter once told a group raising concerns about the character Merida\u2019s cynical attitude in \u201cBrave,\u201d according to a former colleague. He said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t make the movies Walt Disney made today.\u201d\n\nMr. Lasseter couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. He left Disney earlier this year following allegations he had inappropriately touched subordinates. After the allegations surfaced, he sent a letter to employees apologizing to \u201canyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture.\u201d\n\nHis successors, Pete Docter at Pixar and Jennifer Lee at Disney Animation, have strong track records of strong female characters in movies such as \u201cInside Out\u201d and \u201cFrozen.\u201d\n\nEmma Watson and Luke Evans in the 2017 live-action remake of \u2018Beauty and the Beast.\u2019 Photo: Everett Collection\n\nAmong Disney\u2019s imminent tests: A sequel to \u201cFrozen\u201d is slated for next year, and a small group of fans have called for a lesbian love interest for Elsa. Live-action remakes of \u201cAladdin\u201d and \u201cMulan\u201d are in the works. At Disney, and the industry in general, sales of toys tied to movie releases have fallen in recent years, putting more pressure on the princess team to sell dolls and dresses.\n\nMeanwhile, new role models, such as Rey, the lightsaber-wielding protagonist of the Disney \u201cStar Wars\u201d features, have won over young girls. The Disney television shows \u201cElena of Avalor\u201d and \u201cSofia the First\u201d portray more independent heroines.\n\nIn October, actress Kristen Bell\u2014the voice of Anna in \u201cFrozen\u201d\u2014told Parents magazine she dissects the older princess narratives with her daughters.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission?\u201d she said.\n\nKeira Knightley, a star of Disney\u2019s recent \u201cThe Nutcracker and the Four Realms,\u201d said last month on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d that she\u2019s kept \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d from her home because of Ariel\u2019s decision to forfeit her voice to find love: \u201cI mean, the songs are great, but do not give your voice up for a man. Hello?!\u201d\n\nMelissa Villaneuva, a 28-year-old mother of two in Los Angeles, said her mother would show her movies like \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d and \u201cSnow White\u201d and tell her, as the credits rolled, \u201cYou have to find someone to take care of you.\u201d\n\nMovie nights with her son and daughter, ages 11 and 10, now feature more empowered narratives like \u201cTangled\u201d and \u201cBrave.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want them to think like I did,\u201d Ms. Villaneuva said.\n\nThe modern Disney princess business dates to 2000, when a company executive named Andy Mooney attended a Disney on Ice show in Phoenix. He found himself surrounded by young girls in homemade princess costumes.\n\nWhy couldn\u2019t they buy such a dress at a Disney store? he thought, according to published interviews. Mr. Mooney declined to comment.\n\nUntil that point, merchandising for older Disney princesses went on sale only if it was part of a coming movie\u2019s campaign. Mr. Mooney\u2019s idea: Build a franchise that sells toys and dresses and books about classic characters like Snow White and Cinderella along with newer heroines such as Ariel and Belle.\n\nIn 2000, sales for the princess division were worth $300 million. By 2009, they had reached $4 billion, Disney says.\n\nThe new concept came with a crucial rule, invisible to most everyday fans, that is still practiced by princess purists at Disney today, employees say.\n\nOne rule: The princesses should not look in the same direction when they appear together. Photo: Alamy\n\nAnimators must draw princesses\u2019 eyes looking in different directions when they appear on the same lunch box or poster. That\u2019s because the princesses are not to live in the same imagined universe, even if they\u2019re adjacent to each other in the physical world.\n\n\u201cAriel and Belle wouldn\u2019t be friends. Cinderella and Snow White wouldn\u2019t know each other,\u201d said one former Disney executive.\n\nThat rule was thrown out the window with the scene in \u201cRalph Breaks the Internet\u201d\u2014and breaking it was a major reason behind some employees\u2019 consternation.\n\nFor several years following its creation, Disney\u2019s princess franchise worked with both classic and modern characters, such as Belle, known for her bookishness, and Mulan, the Asian warrior princess. Remakes and merchandise related to the classic characters renewed criticism of the old-fashioned narratives.\n\nIn 2009, Disney released \u201cThe Princess and the Frog,\u201d its first animated princess movie in more than a decade, starring Tiana, the company\u2019s first African-American heroine. It grossed a disappointing $104 million at the box office. It remains the company\u2019s lowest-grossing princess movie.\n\nTiana\u2019s introduction was a breakthrough, but the movie\u2019s performance had the princess workers worried the word \u201cprincess\u201d itself was a liability.\n\nMovie Royalty All Time Domestic Gross Sleeping Beauty (1959) Brave (2012) $51.6M* $237M Cinderella (1950) Beauty and the Beast (1991) $93M* Frozen (2013) $219M $401M Aladdin (1992) Beauty and the Beast (live-action remake 2017) $217M $504M The Little Mermaid (1989) Tangled (2010) $111.5M* Snow White (1937) $201M Mulan (1998) Cinderella (live-action remake 2015) $185M* $121M $201M All-time domestic gross Sleeping Beauty (1959) Brave (2012) $51.6M* Cinderella (1950) $237M Beauty and the Beast (1991) Frozen (2013) $93M* $219M $401M Aladdin (1992) Beauty and the Beast (live-action remake 2017) $217M The Little Mermaid (1989) $504M Tangled (2010) Snow White (1937) $111.5M* Mulan (1998) $201M Cinderella (live-action remake 2015) $185M* $121M $201M All-time domestic gross Sleeping Beauty (1959) Brave (2012) $51.6M* $237M Cinderella (1950) Beauty and the Beast (1991) Frozen (2013) $93M* $219M $401M Aladdin (1992) Beauty and the Beast (live-action remake 2017) $217M $504M The Little Mermaid (1989) Tangled (2010) Snow White (1937) $111.5M* Mulan (1998) $201M Cinderella (live-action remake 2015) $185M* $121M $201M All-time domestic gross Beauty and the Beast (1991) Aladdin (1992) $219M $217M Frozen (2013) Brave (2012) $401M $237M The Little Mermaid (1989) Beauty and the Beast (live-action remake 2017) $111.5M* $504M Cinderella (live-action remake 2015) Tangled (2010) $201M $201M Snow White (1937) $185M* Mulan (1998) $142M $121M Sleeping Beauty (1959) Cinderella (1950) $51.6M* $93M*\n\nWith budgets for animated movies often approaching $200 million, Disney needs to appeal to a range of young moviegoers to achieve the blockbuster grosses that ensure profitability. The word \u201cprincess,\u201d they worried, alienated boys.\n\nThe next year, a princess movie about the long-haired Rapunzel was called \u201cTangled.\u201d Two years after that, a movie about Merida, the pugnacious redhead princess was titled \u201cBrave.\u201d\n\nSometimes the company\u2019s other attempts to steer away from the girlier aspects of princesses backfired among some employees.\n\nBefore the release of \u201cFrozen\u201d in 2013, some consumer-products executives thought moviegoers\u2014and specifically boys\u2014would respond to Olaf, the goofy snowman sidekick of the film, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Lasseter didn\u2019t want the movie\u2019s marketing to focus too much on the sisters and risk being written off as just another princess movie, his former colleagues said.\n\nFor some Disney employees, Elsa and Anna embodied just the kind of message they wanted to send\u2014only to see higher-ups play it down for fear of alienating boys.\n\n\u201cThe creative side has leeway and scope. And then there is this massive, unwieldy side dictated by middle management that can really dumb up the machinery, which is why you can have a progressive film like \u2018Frozen\u2019 but then see that the company focuses consumer products on Olaf,\u201d said one former Disney executive who worked on the princess brand.\n\nOlaf ultimately took a small role in a consumer products campaign centered on the princesses, and stores still ran out of dolls and dresses inspired by Elsa, the movie\u2019s strong-willed heroine. \u201cFrozen\u201d collected $1.28 billion at the world-wide box office.\n\nSoon after \u201cFrozen\u201d came the adaptation of \u201cCinderella,\u201d the first of several planned live-action updates to older titles. These modern-day versions, employees say, forced Disney to look at its classic characters with fresh eyes.\n\nThe prince in the 1950 \u201cCinderella\u201d original has only six lines of dialogue\u2014two of which are, \u201cWait!\u201d Chris Weitz, writer of the 2015 live-action version, wanted to deepen the prince\u2019s character to make him \u201cworth Cinderella\u2019s attention.\u201d He said, \u201cCinderella is, in a way, the most regressive fantasy of the Disney princess. If you were just to read it, it says what you need to save you is a handsome and wealthy man\u2014who in fact she doesn\u2019t know very well.\u201d\n\nSections of dialogue were added to the 2017 live-action \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d to contend with what director Bill Condon called the \u201cStockholm syndrome\u201d of a story about a young woman who falls in love with her captor. Mr. Condon said he was pushed by Emma Watson, the 28-year-old actress playing Belle, to include dialogue that showed her resistance:\n\nBeast: You think you could be happy here?\n\nBelle: Can anybody be happy if they\u2019re not free?\n\nThe live-action \u201cAladdin,\u201d due for release in May, elevates the role of Jasmine from the cartoon version, where she was often secondary to Aladdin\u2019s antics. A live-action \u201cMulan,\u201d currently in production for a 2020 release, features Chinese actress Liu Yifei leading an Asian cast in the story of a young woman who disguises herself as a man to join in a battle.\n\nEven modern-day princesses have caused problems after they have left theaters. Merida of \u201cBrave,\u201d for instance, was considered \u201ctoo thick\u201d in girth by some employees when the movie was first conceived, according to employees. The argument was eventually overruled.\n\nIn 2013, still selling figurines and posters of Merida a year after the movie\u2019s release, Disney released a new image of the character. The update, marking her official coronation as a Disney princess, gave her a cinched waist and cleavage.\n\nMerida from the 2012 film \u2018Brave.\u2019 Photo: Everett Collection\n\nAfter fan outcry over the slimmer, glammed-up Merida, Disney returned to the original version. For months afterward, employees say, confused designers wondered: \u201cWhich version of Merida are we using?\u201d\n\nThe next test will come soon enough with \u201cRalph Breaks the Internet.\u201d In the summer of 2017, Disney showed the princess clip that had divided its own employees at an annual gathering of die-hard fans, some dressed as princesses themselves.\n\nThe audience burst into applause.\n\nWrite to Erich Schwartzel at erich.schwartzel@wsj.com"}, {"source": {"id": "the-wall-street-journal", "name": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "author": "Jonathan D.

PFE 0.09% plans to resume its practice of raising drug prices early next year after bowing to pressure from President Trump over the summer when the company rolled back some increases.\n\nPfizer, among the world\u2019s biggest drugmakers by sales, won\u2019t be raising prices as much as it has in past years.\n\nIt said it would raise the list prices of 41 of its prescription drugs, or 10% of its portfolio, in January. The price increases were first reported by The Wall Street Journal earlier Friday.\n\nPfizer\u2019s move comes amid mounting public scrutiny of drug pricing and growing pressure on pharmaceutical companies to lower prices.\n\nIt timed its announcement to its notification of insurers and state-run health plans in California that it was raising some prices, a person familiar with the matter said. Under a 2017 California law, Pfizer had to give 60-day notice if it wanted to increase the prices of certain drugs by more than 16% over two years.\n\nRepresentatives for Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. BMY -0.51% and Allergan PLC said they also made notifications required under California\u2019s new law but declined to name the drugs. Bristol-Myers said its list-price increases next year wouldn\u2019t exceed 6%.\n\nThe White House directed questions to the Health and Human Services Department, which said the actions illustrate the \u201cperverse incentives\u201d in drug pricing that hurt consumers.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump and Secretary [Alex] Azar remain committed to lowering drug prices and reducing out-of-pocket costs, and will continue to take bold action to restructure this broken market,\u201d a health-department spokeswoman said.\n\nLike most of its rivals, Pfizer had regularly increased prices over the years. The moves helped it boost revenues even as sales were dropping for lucrative medicines that had lost patent protection and were facing competition from lower-priced generics.\n\nNow, companies face a new calculus when they want to raise drug prices. Patients, whose rising deductibles have exposed them more to list-price increases, are speaking out. Lawmakers have responded by holding hearings, and passing transparency laws like California\u2019s.\n\nDrug companies have raised list prices on 263 drugs so far this year by an average of 7.8%, compared with averages surpassing 12% over the same period during the peak years of 2014 and 2015, according to Elliot Wilbur, a Raymond James & Associates analyst.\n\nDrug pricing was an issue for Democrats and Republicans in the recent midterm elections. In October, Mr. Trump visited the Health and Human Services Department to offer plans for driving down the prices that Medicare pays for some drugs.\n\nTo get ahead of the public pressure, several big drugmakers including Allergan have pledged to take just one price increase each year and by less than 10%, or issued reports reporting average annual price changes.\n\nPfizer didn\u2019t take those kinds of steps, and discovered the changed climate after it made increases on more than 40 of its medicines in July. Many of the increases lifted prices by 9.4%, and by double-digit percentages for the year overall.\n\nMr. Trump tweeted the company \u201cshould be ashamed,\u201d prompting Pfizer shares to fall temporarily. The company then reversed the increases.\n\nYet Pfizer said at the time it was only deferring price increases, and Chief Executive Ian Read has told analysts and investors that the company would resume its pricing practices.\n\nOf the 41 price increases Pfizer announced, 23 met the California law\u2019s threshold, according to the person familiar with the matter. Most of the increases Pfizer plans in January will be 5%, though the company will raise three drugs\u2019 list prices by 3% and one drug\u2019s by 9%. The company said it was making the 9% increase because that drug has been approved for new uses thanks to ongoing study.\n\nThe moves don\u2019t affect 90% of Pfizer\u2019s portfolio, including newly approved medicines and sterile injectables, the person familiar with the matter said. The company didn\u2019t name the drugs whose list prices it plans on raising.\n\nPfizer said it didn\u2019t expect its revenues would grow any higher from the increases, because it will also up the discounts and rebates it pays to health plans buying the company\u2019s drugs.\n\nMr. Read said he hoped patients would benefit from the rebates. \u201cWe believe the best means to address affordability of medicines is to reduce the growing out-of-pocket costs that consumers are facing due to high deductibles and co-insurance,\u201d he added.\n\nWrite to Jonathan D.

Nycha agreed to a court-appointed monitor to oversee $1.2 billion in repairs over the next five years. On Wednesday in a 52-page ruling, federal Judge William Pauley III, a Bill Clinton appointee, rejected the settlement as inadequate and perhaps unconstitutional.\n\nAccording to the New York State Department of Public Health, 83% of Nycha\u2019s inspected units contained a hazardous condition. \u201cSomewhat reminiscent of the biblical plagues of Egypt, these conditions include toxic lead paint, asthma-inducing mold, lack of heat, frequent elevator outages, and vermin infestations,\u201d the judge noted, adding that the authority \u201cwhitewashed these deficiencies for years.\u201d\n\nWhile Mayor de Blasio agreed to spend an additional $1.2 billion to fix Nycha\u2019s 326 complexes that house 400,000 people, conditions are so awful that the authority estimates it needs $32 billion for repairs. \u201cNYCHA\u2019s current capital needs would not be met until the year 2166,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nJudge Pauley added that a special monitor \u201cwould bring about an unwarranted\u2014and as far as this Court is aware, unprecedented\u2014judicial usurpation of responsibilities that Congress has expressly entrusted to\u201d the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and \u201craises serious concerns implicating the separation of powers and the delegation of equitable judicial power.\u201d\n\nCourts have become all too eager to offload responsibility for fixing the problems of the political branches to special monitors, which blurs democratic accountability. But as Judge Pauley points out, Section 6 of the U.S. Housing Act gives HUD \u201ca robust arsenal of remedies\u201d for failing public housing agencies, including private management and federal receivership.\n\nFixing Nycha \u201crequires political will at all levels,\u201d the judge concludes, and may even necessitate \u201cabrogating collective-bargaining agreements and vendor contracts.\u201d But neither politician will take on the public unions whose wages and pensions are bleeding New York\u2019s budget.

This year Democrats busted one of their own cherished myths by proving that Republican gerrymanders weren\u2019t preventing them from retaking the House of Representatives. There\u2019s a lesson here for voters and judges.\n\nState legislatures have been drawing congressional boundaries to favor one party or another since America\u2019s founding. During the 40 years of sustained Democratic control of the House in the late 20th century, this worked in the Democrats\u2019 favor. As political scientist Matt Grossmann has shown, Democrats sometimes enjoyed congressional majorities nearly 10 percentage points larger than their share of the House popular vote.\n\nPotomac Watch Podcast\n\nPotomac Watch Podcast Potomac Watch podcast: The Florida election recounts and Amazon agonistes.\n\nThen came the Republican romp of 2010, followed by the Census and the regular 10-year redistricting to reflect population ebb and flow across the U.S. The new GOP majorities in several states drew districts that increased their representation in the House, as Democrats also did where they had a partisan advantage.\n\nFor many commentators the post-2010 redistricting created a crisis of democracy by supposedly locking Democrats out of power. Days before the 2018 election the New York Times\u2019 David Leonhardt cited Republican gerrymandering as evidence that the U.S. could \u201cslide toward Hungarian autocracy.\u201d\n\nWell, so much for that. Democrats last week made their largest gain in House seats since 1974 and appear to be closing in on a 233-seat House majority with several races still not called. This means Democrats will hold about 53.6% of seats\u2014a 7.1% edge. And, what do you know, Democratic House candidates nationwide have 52.8% of votes\u20147.3% more than Republicans, according to the latest Cook Political Report tally.\n\nMore telling is that the Democrats\u2019 popular vote edge is inflated by more than three dozen districts nationwide that had no Republican candidate on the ballot. By contrast, only a few GOP candidates were running unchallenged. Democrats will likely be better represented in the House than they would be if House membership were chosen by a nationwide generic ballot.\n\nLiberals are still complaining that redistricting may have limited Democratic gains this year in states like North Carolina and Ohio because Democrats\u2019 statewide vote share is greater than their share of representatives. But in states like New Jersey (which will have one GOP Congressman out of 12) and California, Republicans are wildly underrepresented by that same standard. The biggest Democratic problem in the House is geography because far more of their voters are concentrated in cities. But that was less of a liability this year as the suburbs turned more Democratic.\n\nNone of this should be surprising. Even a cleverly partisan gerrymander contains the seeds of its own undoing as political coalitions change. A district\u2019s partisanship shifts by election based on public mood, changing demographics and the issues debated.\n\nLegislatures looking to protect Republican seats in 2011 drew very different boundaries than would be necessary today. In 2011 Republican Rep. Pete Sessions\u2019 district in Texas was extended east into the suburbs of Garland that were thought to be comfortably Republican. This year Mr. Sessions lost.\n\nThe other gerrymandering story from last Tuesday is the success of campaigns in Colorado, Michigan and Missouri (one in Utah is too close to call) to take redistricting power away from the political branches with the aim of creating a less partisan process.\n\nVoters have every right to do this, but \u201cindependent\u201d line-drawing may be no less polarizing or unfair. These states may simply be turning political choices over to less accountable authorities with their own partisan biases. The New Jersey congressional and state legislative maps are no less favorable to Democrats because they were designed by a supposedly independent commission.\n\nAll of this reinforces the argument that judges should keep out of fights over partisan gerrymanders. They would inevitably favor one party over another and cause more Americans to question judicial independence.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened this year in Pennsylvania, where the Democratic majority on the state Supreme Court rewrote the state GOP majority\u2019s 2011 congressional map and helped Democrats flip four seats statewide. The U.S. Supreme Court can use the evidence of 2018 as reason to end its flirtation with ruling on partisan maps\u2014and let the parties fight it out in elections as usual."}]
