A shopper spending $40 at any of the companies on Small Business Saturday will get $10 off purchases at the other seven. Kim Roman, owner of Mama Java Coffee, says the group, which will market the event on Instagram and other social media, came up with the idea just a few weeks ago. \"We were chatting about ways to be unique and help promote each other,\" she said.\n\nMany communal Small Business Saturday events have grown to the point where they're organized by local chambers of commerce and community business organizations that have big marketing budgets. About 200 indie retailers throughout Portland, Oregon, are banding together in a marketing effort called Shop Little Boxes that will run from Friday through Sunday. The stores are offering discounts, many of them 10 percent, and shoppers get raffle ticket numbers for each visit and purchase they make. Shop Little Boxes has a smartphone app that shoppers can use to find participating stores and to register their raffle ticket numbers.\n\nRetailers say they do see sales blip up during Small Business Saturday, but their aim is also to remind shoppers that they are there year-round.\n\nThe event in Henderson, Nevada, like many others, is aimed at fostering goodwill; Shop Small Henderson will be a five-hour block party with activities for children. Parents may not be able to do much shopping during such events, but owners say they do return to shop after the party is over.\n\nLandlords also sponsor Small Business Saturday events at their developments. Pier Village, a residential complex in Long Branch, New Jersey, has about 30 retail tenants, and many will be taking part in a communal Small Business Saturday event.\n\nSome of the events aim at giving craft makers and artisans a place to sell their creations; about a dozen craft makers will take part in a pop-up event at Broadway Market, a retail complex in Seattle. And some companies with surplus space are inviting small vendors to set up shop on their premises \u2014 in Elmhurst, Illinois, Brewpoint Coffee is hosting small retailers in its roastery."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Jimmy Butler traded to the Philadelphia 76ers", "description": "The Minnesota Timberwolves ended their drama-filled saga with Jimmy Butler by trading him to the Philadelphia 76ers.

Will those favoring taxes as a remedy for health problems now come for our barbecue?\n\nSlapping taxes on processed meat and red meat could prevent 222,000 deaths and save $41 billion in global health costs every year, according to a new study.\n\nThe figures are based on studies that have linked red meat consumption to cancer, diabetes and stroke. In the U.S., the proposed tax would be set at 163 percent on processed meat such as sausages or bacon, and 34 percent on red meat, like steak or ground beef.\n\n\"In the U.S.A., tax levels are much higher because the health system is one of the least efficient in the word,\" said Marco Springmann, the study's lead author. It's not the highest, though: Germany, Austria, Norway and Sweden all would see a slightly higher meat tax under this system, the study showed.\n\nSpringmann said the idea for the study came several years ago, when the World Health Organization declared certain types of meat were carcinogenic. \"If it's a carcinogen, surely it ought to be regulated in some way, because governments have a responsibility to protect their citizens from carcinogens,\" he said.\n\nThe taxation system would save an estimated 53,000 lives in the U.S., according to the study.\n\nNot everyone agrees. The North American Meat Institute took issue with the study, pointing out that it did not take into account meat's nutritional benefits\u2014among other criticisms.\n\n\"There are many other public health recommendations and alterations to people's lifestyle that would reduce the burden of chronic disease like maintaining a healthy weight, living an active lifestyle, and not smoking to name a few. The 95% of Americans and billions of others around the world who eat meat and enjoy the many nutritional benefits it provides should never have to be punished with a tax on a delicious food that nourishes them,\" KatieRose McCullough, the group's director of scientific and regulatory affairs, said in a statement.\n\nBut it's not the first time a \"meat tax\" has been proposed: PETA came out with the idea several years ago. FAIRR, an investment group that does research around \"risks and opportunities caused by intensive livestock production\" has also suggested the idea. Denmark briefly had a tax on saturated fats, which acted much like a \"meat tax,\" before repealing it in 2012.\n\nMeat may be a long shot, but more and more municipalities are taxing other dubious items like sugar-sweetened drinks. (Recreational drugs like liquor, tobacco and marijuana are taxed even more heavily.)\n\nTaxing meat \"makes a tremendous amount of sense,\" said Michael Martin, a physician and professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nWhen sugar-sweetened drinks are taxed, he noted, population health improves because people consume less of them.\n\nHe added, \"People have to get used to this idea that red meat is not good for us.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Trump says he's written answers to questions from Special Counsel Robert Mueller", "description": "President Trump says he has written answers to Mueller's questions but has yet to submit them.

The police department review was just wrapping up last month when evidence of alleged investigative misconduct surfaced against Det. Nicholas DiGaudio, whom Osgood worked closely with on the Weinstein case.\n\nWeinstein faces criminal charges in New York over allegations that he raped an unidentified woman in his hotel room in 2013 and performed a forcible sex act on a different woman in 2006. A judge last month agreed to dismiss charges related to a third accuser, Lucia Evans, when evidence surfaced that DiGaudio had coached a witness to stay silent about evidence that cast doubt on Evans' account. Afterward, police said DiGaudio was no longer involved in the case. His union has said he \"was simply trying to get to the truth\" and wasn't trying to influence the investigation.\n\nDiGaudio also allegedly urged the woman, who says the disgraced movie producer raped her in 2013, to delete information from her phone before turning it over to investigators. Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said in a letter that the information wasn't related to the case and that the woman turned over her cellphone \"without any deletions\" after speaking with her lawyer. Illuzzi-Orbon has insisted the remainder of the case against Weinstein remains strong.\n\nCBS New York\n\nWeinstein's lawyers said last week that they want to question Osgood in court about DiGaudio's conduct. Weinstein denies all allegations of nonconsensual sex.\n\nChief of Detectives Dermot Shea, who led the police review of the special victims division, thanked Osgood for his \"dedication and tremendous contributions\" in his eight years in charge of the unit. The head of Osgood's union said he was \"not just the expert, but the innovative creator of modern day investigative techniques and policing of sex crimes offenses.\"\n\nDepartment memos included in the report showed that Osgood had been asking for more staff for at least four years. He had also requested additional training for detectives and recommended starting a cold case squad.\n\nThe Department of Investigation report, issued in late March, found there were just 67 special victims detectives for a caseload of 5,661 suspected attacks last year, leaving the bulk of assault cases to precinct-level detectives who had less training and experience dealing with victims. As a result, police prioritized stranger rapes while sexual assaults committed by acquaintances received less attention.\n\nSince then, the NYPD has transferred about three dozen investigators into the special victims division, freed up about a dozen more to handle cases and, as of July, is requiring that unit detectives investigate all felony sex crimes.\n\nPlease welcome the new Commanding Officer of our Special Victims Division, Deputy Chief Judith Harrison. @NYPDSVU pic.twitter.com/n1L0wMser4 \u2014 Chief Dermot F. Shea (@NYPDDetectives) November 15, 2018\n\nThe added staffing has dropped the average caseload from 76.5 per detective at the end of 2017 to 63.7, and it's projected to fall further next year even if reports of sexual assaults continue to trend upward, the department said.\n\nThe department, criticized in the report for re-traumatizing victims and jeopardizing prosecutions, accelerated a program to train all special-victims investigators in interview techniques that are meant to be more compassionate and understanding than typical questioning. It's also heeding a recommendation in the report to repair police facilities to make victims more comfortable.\n\n\"We are deeply committed to doing everything and anything necessary to ensure survivors feel the safety and support needed to come forward, bravely share their experiences, and help the NYPD bring to justice those who have committed these horrific crimes,\" Shea said.\n\nShea admitted the watchdog report identified areas where the special victims division can improve, and said the changes were made with the input of the advocate community. He noted a 25 percent increase this year of reports of sexual assaults in New York City, and said advocates he's spoken with believe more people coming forward in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which was sparked in the wake of the multiple accusations against Weinstein.\n\n\"It is their belief these crimes are happening, there is no difference, and it's just now the light is being shined on it,\" Shea said.\n\nShea said Harrison, a 21-year member of the NYPD, will bring a \"new set of eyes and a fresh perspective\" to the unit.\n\nHarrison has been a precinct commander in Queens and led patrol units in the neighborhoods near LaGuardia Airport. She was promoted in July to deputy chief and was assigned to the detective bureau, which oversees the special victims division.\n\nAs she takes over, the division is being streamlined into two squads -- one focusing on crimes against adults and the other on child abuse, each with new leadership as a part of an overhaul of the detectives bureau. The hate crimes unit, which had been a part of the special victims division, is being moved to the special investigations division, which includes the computer crimes and major case squads.\n\nRoy Richter, the president of the Captains Endowment Association, said Harrison is a talented commander and that he is \"confident she will meet this challenge as she has excelled with others in the past.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "Recipe: Chrissy Teigen's Asian Pear & Avocado Salad", "description": "A delicious dish from the bestselling cookbook author", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/recipe-chrissy-teigen-asian-pear-avocado-salad/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/16/8697ee56-207c-4e30-83dc-9b683e0f690d/thumbnail/1200x630/7c70f3ae737931d2406de6568f9b1f43/cravings-hungry-for-more-cover-potter-promo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T22:39:15Z", "content": "In her latest bestselling cookbook, \"Cravings: Hungry for More\" (Potter), Chrissy Teigen writes happily that she is not allergic to peanut oil. \"If I was, my mom, Pepper Thai, would have traded me in for a better, hardier model.

Dropping prices have brought the cost of a Thanksgiving meal to an eight-year low, said the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n\nThis year, the average nationwide cost of a holiday meal for 10 people is $48.90, or less than $5 per person, according to the farm group's annual survey. That's a 22-cent decrease from last year's average. The bureau has been tracking the price of a basket of Thanksgiving groceries since 1989. Adjusting for inflation, this year's spread would have cost just $19.37 at that time.\n\nA chunk of savings is due to turkey prices, which are at their lowest since 2014, according to the bureau. The cost is at $21.71 for a 16-pound bird, or roughly $1.36 per pound. Milk, fresh sweet potato, canned green peas and dinner-roll prices are also down.\n\nOne reason is an ample supply of turkeys, which has kept prices stable through the year, IHS Markit analysts said in a note. \"While the typical seasonal pattern is for the price of turkey to increase as the year progresses, 2018 has been different. Consumers seem to have been losing their appetite for turkey compared to other meats, and the birds have not been flying off the shelves.\"\n\nAs for how to get the cheapest turkey: Buy frozen, said economist Jay Zagorsky, an adjunct associate professor at Boston University. The typical store earns about 30 cents per frozen bird, which is barely enough to cover the cost of transporting it to the store or keeping it frozen. (The store is betting, however, that people coming in to buy turkeys will load up on other, higher-margin items.)\n\nIt's a different story for fresh turkeys\u2014which are also the birds people most like to serve, according to Zagorsky. The retail price of a fresh hen turkey is about $1.51 a pound, or $30.20 for a 20-pound bird.\n\nWhat you pay can also depend on where you live, with the priciest turkeys sold in Hawaii and in the South Central states, from Louisiana to Colorado. Zagorsky suggests that's thanks to competition: There are fewer supermarkets in that part of the country, while the Southeast region--where turkeys are cheapest--has the highest number of retailers.\n\nHowever you prefer to cook your turkey\u2014or turkey parts\u2014maybe leave turkey sausage off the list.

If you think bamboo straws would go unused by your giftee, paper varieties in bamboo prints are available by the box.\n\nPrices vary for bamboo straws. One company, Brush with Bamboo, sells a cute bundle of 12 tied with string, for $20. They are grown organically and artisan-made in northeast India, where bamboo straws are traditionally used to drink beer.\n\nAs for glass, well, some companies insist their offerings are shatter free. A box of four , with a little cleaning brush, goes for $7.99 on Amazon. Two are bent. Ecostraw.com sells a nice variety for all types of drinks.\n\nPasta & wheat\n\nThey may not be the longest lasting but many are no-GMO, fully biodegradable and come in wide sizes worthy of bubble tea.\n\nOne version is called Hay! Straws and comes tall at 7.75 inches, in a cute box of 100, for $8. Shorter ones are also available. They're made from wheat stems and are sold with a warning to sip through them, not ingest them.\n\nAnother company calls itself, yes, Pasta Straw. It says it's working on a gluten-free version.\n\nSo what's the draw? Well, Pasta Straws says on its website that paper straws biodegrade in 30 to 60 days. Pasta Straws do it overnight and are edible, the company said. A sample pack wrapped in paper with a company sticker includes 24 and goes for $7.99.\n\nThe problem: Generally, pasta straws don't last as long as, say, glass or metal. Upside, they don't get soggy like paper straws."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "MoneyWatch", "title": "Black Friday best video game deals: 2018's hit games get big discounts on Black Friday, depending on how new the games are", "description": "Release dates to determine how deep the discounts will be for some of the biggest video games of 2018", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/black-friday-best-video-game-deals-hit-video-games-get-big-discounts-on-black-friday-depending-on-how-new-the-games-are/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/06/03/b4e8735b-2fd3-4cc0-9701-7c25e7adc0cf/thumbnail/1200x630/0f4092b603923f9c5348a5c3b1cb46e4/xbox1.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T22:08:47Z", "content": "For many video game fans, Black Friday is an opportunity to snag some of the biggest, newest and most-hyped games of the year at deep discounts from the usual full retail price of $60.

Newer games, by contrast, are still riding high on their release popularity, and get shallower discounts -- or none at all.\n\nThe price of the August release EA Sports' Madden NFL 19, for example, will be slashed down to $30 on Black Friday at Target, Best Buy and Walmart. Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 from Activision, meanwhile, was released in mid-October and is coming down as low as $40 at Walmart and $45 at both Target and Best Buy. Games that have been out even longer and see their popularity dwindle as new games take the gaming community's attention can go even lower.\n\nOther major titles considered to be great gets for gamers are Sony's critically acclaimed God of War, which came out in April, at $25; EA Sports' FIFA 19, released in September, at $30; the Destiny 2 Forsaken Legendary Collection from Activision at $30 to $35; and Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed: Odyssey, released in October, for $30.\n\nThe big question on the minds of many shoppers is what price drops retailers might offer on the newest games. Many of the biggest releases of the year come just ahead of the holidays in late October and November--meaning that it's not always clear just how much those popular new games might be discounted.\n\nIf there's one major Black Friday mystery at the moment, it's Red Dead Redemption 2, from Grand Theft Auto developer Rockstar Games. The sprawling Western epic came out at the end of October and has already been a success for parent company Take-Two Interactive, which has shipped some 17 million copies of the game worldwide.\n\nFans who haven't mounted up a digital horse in Red Dead Redemption 2 will be looking for an opportunity to do that on Black Friday, although given the game's continued popularity, it's an open question how much it'll actually be discounted. So far, there have only been three sales. One is eBay's week-long \"Better Than Black Friday\" sale, which has the game down to $48 on Xbox One. The other two sales are on Sony's PlayStation Store and Microsoft's Xbox.com digital storefronts, which only see the more expensive Special and Ultimate editions discounted.\n\nSimilar questions revolve around the newly released online multiplayer game Fallout 76 from Skyrim developer Bethesda, as well as Nintendo's Pokemon: Let's Go, which connects to the mobile hit Pokemon Go, and Electronic Arts' Battlefield V. Best Buy, Target and Walmart have put out early Black Friday ads that don't include these releases. Since they're so new, it's possible they won't be discounted at all.\n\nGame consoles, headsets, controllers on sale, too\n\nDeals on video games aren't the only things for players to take advantage of on Black Friday. The shopping holiday might be even better for grabbing good prices on expensive hardware products like game consoles and items that don't often see much in the way of price cuts, such as headsets and controllers.\n\nConsole makers use Black Friday as an opportunity to get machines in the living rooms of more players, thereby enlarging their customer base for games. It usually happens in the form of bundles that put consoles together with games and come in at an overall discount, while the prices of unbundled consoles drop even more. This Black Friday, the Sony PlayStation 4 Slim model is bundled with the PS4-exclusive game Marvel's Spider-Man, with its price dropped to $200, a $100 discount.\n\nMicrosoft's Xbox One is coming in at several price points on Black Friday. The sleeker Xbox One S model is seeing price drops to $200, while the more powerful Xbox One X is around $400--combined with certain promotions such as the one Kohl's is running, which includes $120 in the retailer's \"Kohl's Cash.\" There are also bundles with both models of the console, which add games like PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds into the discount equation.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nintendo Switch, the newest console on the market, having come out March 2017, might be disappointing for gamers seeking Black Friday deals. Early ads put the console at its regular price of $300 on Black Friday. The upshot, however, is that those full-price Switch consoles are coming bundled with fan-favorite Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. With many of the other games in the Switch's growing library seeing deep cuts, Black Friday might be a good day to pick up Nintendo's machine for those who've been holding back.\n\nThe good news about Black Friday is that regardless of what gamers are in the market for, they're bound to find some kind of deal that appeals. Whether it's games seeing lower prices, consoles becoming more affordable, or an opportunity to add or replace peripheral gaming hardware, Black Friday is a great time for gamers to stock up for the year ahead."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Grace Segers", "title": "Stacey Abrams acknowledges Brian Kemp will win Georgia gubernatorial race", "description": "Abrams narrowly trails Republican Brian Kemp in the Georgia gubernatorial race", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stacey-abrams-georgia-gubernatorial-race-brian-kemp-live-stream-2018-11-16/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/07/06bc5a43-9d4e-4b29-a8a6-8ba4f8a4af63/thumbnail/1200x630/a0ba7ba52a045152a046ac8a33319f34/2018-11-07t065810z-707468505-rc16c7f538d0-rtrmadp-3-usa-election-georgia.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T22:08:20Z", "content": "Stacey Abrams, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate for governor in Georgia, addressed supporters after she earlier mulled bringing a legal challenge that could allow a judge to decide whether to force a second round of voting in the closely contested race.\u2026 [+1442 chars]", "fulltext": "Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor in Georgia, said Friday she would no longer pursue victory in the race.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says over the past year, there have been 164 illnesses in 35 states, including one death in California.\n\nHealth officials say salmonella has been detected in ground turkey, raw turkey pet food and live turkeys, an indication the bacteria is widespread in the turkey industry.\n\nOn Friday, Jennie-O Turkey announced it's recalling more than 91,000 pounds of raw turkey for possible salmonella contamination. The products being recalled include one-pound packages of raw, ground turkey sold nationwide. They had a use-by date of October, but could still be in freezers. Regulators say the product should be thrown away.\n\nThis was the first recall tied to the outbreak, but not necessarily the only source of the illnesses. The investigation continues and it's possible other brands could be involved. So it's especially important to follow safe food handling and cooking recommendations to reduce the risk of illness.\n\nSalmonella can lead to symptoms including diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness typically lasts four to seven days. Most people recover without treatment, but in some patients, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Children under 5, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to have severe illness from contaminated food that could lead to hospitalization.\n\nProtect your family from salmonella this Thanksgiving\n\nWith the big holiday coming up, experts are urging consumers to be especially careful when handling raw turkey in the kitchen.\n\nThe following tips can keep you safe from salmonella this Thanksgiving.\n\n1. Thaw turkey in the refrigerator, not the counter\n\nTurkeys must be kept at a safe temperature while thawing. That means thawing it in the refrigerator and not on the counter, on the back porch, in the car trunk, in the basement, or anyplace else where temperatures cannot be constantly monitored.\n\nTurkey should stay below 40\u00b0 F as it thaws to prevent any harmful bacteria that may be present from growing.\n\nPlan ahead: The USDA advises allowing approximately 24 hours for each 4 to 5 pounds in a refrigerator set at 40 \u00b0F or below. So it could take three days in the fridge to thaw an average 15-pound frozen turkey.\n\nPlace the bird in a container to prevent the juices from dripping on and contaminating other foods.\n\n2. Don't wash raw turkey\n\nWashing raw turkey may spread germs from the bird around the kitchen. Instead, open the plastic wrapper carefully and drain liquids into the sink before throwing away the wrapper. Dry the turkey by patting it with paper towels.\n\n3. Wash your hands and kitchen surfaces\n\nBe sure to wash your hands frequently with hot water and soap both during and after handling raw turkey to prevent spreading any harmful germs.\n\nAlso be sure to thoroughly clean utensils, cutting boards, countertops and any other surfaces that may have come into contact with raw turkey.\n\n4. Use a food thermometer: 165\u00b0 F is safe\n\nTurkey should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0 F to be safe to eat. Use a food thermometer and test different parts of the bird to make sure the entire turkey is done.\n\n\"If you cook turkey to the internal temperature of 165\u00b0 F this strain of salmonella should die,\" the CDC's Dr. Colin Basler told CBS News.\n\nThe same goes for stuffing \u2014 make sure it reaches at least 165\u00b0 F \u2014 and the safer option is to cook it separately in a baking dish rather than inside the bird.\n\n5. Handle leftovers properly\n\nRefrigerate leftovers as soon as possible. A cooked turkey should not be left out for more than two hours.\n\nLeftovers must also be reheated to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0 F."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Peter Van Sant", "title": "Houston doctor charged in murder-for-hire plot goes to trial", "description": "\"48 Hours\" has the latest in the investigation into the alleged plot launched by two Houston doctors and their relationship with a former U.S. Army soldier who pretended to take a hit job", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/houston-doctor-leon-jacob-charged-in-murder-for-hire-plot-goes-to-trial/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/10/13/b13c23ac-0467-4d31-8164-be9752c255db/thumbnail/1200x630/12c4a0bc6e4cb8ad3491b2e04c1958ee/mcdaniel-jacob-hero.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T21:38:55Z", "content": "Produced by Susan Mallie, Judy Rybak, Ryan Smith and Claire St. Amant [This story first aired on Oct. 17, 2017.

Frank Quinn: Uh, your, your, your, uh, ex-husband has been found with what looks like um, turns out to be a fatality. Looks like it might've been a robbery gone wrong. Sorry I have to tell you.\n\n[Valerie hangs her head in her hands and cries]\n\nValerie McDaniel's ex-husband, Mack, police tell her, was dead -- just six months after their divorce had become final.\n\nSgt. Frank Quinn: Do you have anyone to call to\u2026help you, to stay with you?\n\nBut how could Valerie's life have arrived at this dreadful moment?\n\nValerie earned her degree in veterinary medicine at Texas A&M. It was during that time she met Mack McDaniel.\n\nGreg Holloway | Valerie's friend: My impression of Mack is that he was a good man. He was a stand-up guy.\n\nMack proposed, and Valerie had the man of her dreams -- as she describes in that recording of her memories:\n\nValerie McDaniel audio diary: We had a beautiful, fairytale wedding. \u2026Moved into a house that my parents had bought for me to live in.\n\nNot long after that Valerie decided to open her own clinic.\n\nCody Bernard | Valeries' cousin: I admired her. It really, you know, it sunk something inside me. I wanted to do that one day, something big, you know?\n\nMack was her office manager, but even as the vet clinic thrived, the two longed for something more.\n\nCody Bernard: She couldn't have any children. \u2026So the only option was to adopt.\n\nIn 2008, the couple adopted a daughter when she was just two days old. But as their new family came together, their marriage began to fall apart. It started, Valerie claims, with a phone call from a stranger -- the woman who claimed to have been Mack's lover. But Valerie says that wasn't all:\n\nValerie McDaniel audio diary: She gave me lists of women that he had slept with...\n\nValerie says she confronted Mack \u2026 and forgave him. But claims it wasn't long before Mack cheated again:\n\nValerie McDaniel audio: \u2026And that was the first time I ever said the word \"divorce.\" \u2026and I yelled it at him outside and I yelled it and yelled it.\n\nValerie says she forgave Mack yet again. But then a chance encounter would change the course of her life. Leon Jacob, the son of Valerie's neighbor, divorce attorney Golda Jacob, stopped by.\n\nValerie McDaniel audio: He ran up to me and stuck his hand out and introduced himself. The cockiest mother-----r I'd ever met in my life.\n\nLeon Jacob: Valerie was in her mid-forties but she was stunning both inside and out.\n\nThe attraction was mutual.\n\nValerie McDaniel audio diary: You could tell he knew how beautiful he was. \u2026And I was lonely.\n\nLeon Jacob was eight years younger than Valerie and a doctor.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What type of surgeries have you done?\n\nLeon Jacob: All kinds of surgeries. \u2026I've assisted in heart, kidney, pancreas transplants.\n\nWith a strained home life and an attractive new friend, what happened next may have been inevitable.\n\nValerie McDaniel audio diary: He sat across from me and we had some wine and I had my feet out on the chair next to him. \u2026And out of the blue he reached out and just ran his finger up my left foot. And that was it. \u2026It was like a movie moment.\n\nPeter Van Sant: It's quite an interlude according to what she described.\n\nLeon Jacob: Yeah. Compliments all around, I guess.\n\nIn December 2014, Valerie filed for divorce claiming Mack committed adultery. Mack's attorneys told \"48 Hours\" Mack had no comment about the divorce petition and the claims Valerie made in her audio diary.\n\nBetween Mack's alleged cheating and Valerie's new love interest, both wanted out of the marriage. Their divorce was finalized in August 2016. Valerie and her daughter moved into a building in the upscale River Oaks area of Houston. Not long after, Leon joined them there.\n\nLeon Jacob: The relationship really blossomed quickly. Because we had been very close friends for so long.\n\nDr. Brittany King worked alongside Valerie at the vet clinic.\n\nDr. Brittany King: They seemed very much in love. \u2026Holding hands and loving towards each other.\n\nBut there was one old problem in Valerie and Leon's new relationship.

He's scary. \u2026He wants what he wants and he'll stop at nothing to get it.\n\nCould there be more to Valerie's new love than she can imagine?\n\nSamantha Knecht: He has no problem using women. In fact, I think he enjoys it.\n\nA DIABOLICAL PLAN\n\nValerie McDaniel's new live-in boyfriend grew up in Texas-sized world of beauty and opulence.\n\nLeon Jacob: I always wanted to be a doctor my whole life ever since I was about 3 or 4.\n\nAs he pursued his degrees, Leon met and married his college sweetheart. They had two boys.\n\nLeon Jacob: We had a happy, loving family. \u2026I got two boys \u2026 they're the most important things to me in my life.\n\nA good family, and now with an M.D. after his name, Leon was well on his way.\n\nBut Leon's picture-perfect life disguised a troubled relationship. After 12 years of marriage, his wife filed for divorce. citing \"extreme mental cruelty.\" And one year later, Leon was arrested for stalking his now-ex.\n\nSamantha Knecht: Leon has to be in control \u2026 when his ex-wife went to end their relationship he wasn't gonna have it -- and he wasn't gonna go down without a fight.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Leon, isn't it true that you've had brushes with the law involving stalking, cyberstalking, intimidation\u2014physical harassment, assault? Aren't all those true?\n\nLeon Jacob: I pled guilty to an attempted cyber harassment charge that was stemming from an acrimonious divorce that I went through with my previous wife.\n\nLeon admits that he called often, but he says it was simply speak with his boys.\n\nLeon Jacob: I tried desperately to contact my kids over and over again. I'm not gonna apologize for that.\n\nLeon finally moved on to a new residency, and was living in Pittsburgh, where he met 33-year-old Meghan Verikas.\n\nLeon Jacob: I met Meghan in a hotel -- in Pittsburgh \u2026 She was the assistant general manager there.\n\nThe new couple moved to Houston. There were lavish vacations, and family get-togethers, and yet another residency, Leon's seventh.\n\nSamantha Knecht: He's a failed doctor... He's been kicked out of every residency program he's ever been a part of.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And what's the problem? What was the basis of these dismissals, do you know?\n\nSamantha Knecht: The belief that he was the smartest guy in the room. Inability to get along with people \u2026 Inability to get along with patients. And in fact, one of the records that we found said that they believe that he was a danger to the patients and that he would be a liability for them to keep around.\n\nThree years into their relationship, Meghan Verikas thought Leon was a threat to her, too. Meghan kicked Leon out of their apartment, later accusing him of assaulting her.\n\nLeon Jacob: She wanted me to move all my stuff out \u2026 she came there and was very hostile. The police were called. There was no violence of any kind. \u2026And a day later, she claimed that I had hit her.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And that you'd put a hand over her mouth.\n\nLeon Jacob: Yeah, which is not true.\n\nSamantha Knecht: Leon is about Leon and it frustrated him to no end that Meghan Verikos would not forgive him \u2026 and the fact that he couldn't get Meghan back frustrated him and angered him.\n\nLeon was arrested in February 2007 for assault and stalking.\n\nLeon Jacob: \u2026 you can charge anybody with anything; it doesn't mean that you're guilty of that.\n\nProsecutors are convinced that Leon knew his future as a doctor would be destroyed if Meghan testified against him. So, they believe, he planned a little operation to make his pain go away.\n\nSamantha Knecht: He feels like if Meghan disappears \u2026 if she goes away \u2026 that his criminal case will go away, and he can resume his career as this beloved surgeon that he thinks that he is.\n\nProsecutors claim Leon decided what he needed was a hit man. And he thought he'd found one.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Taz, are you a hit man?\n\nMoataz Azzeh: No.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Were you ever willing to murder anyone for money?\n\nMoataz Azzeh: No, no. No. I would never do something like that.\n\nTaz Azzeh was introduced to Leon by a mutual acquaintance.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did Leon ever tell you how he wanted his ex-girlfriend to be killed?\n\nMoataz Azzeh: Yes \u2026 he actually -- offered suggestions. One of 'em was a syringe to the heart with potassium, to give her a heart attack and would actually kill her.\n\nTaz is a decorated former U.S. Army soldier, who saw Leon's deadly demand as an opportunity to save a life.\n\nMoataz Azzeh: I saw somebody in danger and I knew that I can do somethin' about it and I did something about it.\n\nLeon knew Taz by the codename Zack. He says Leon wanted him to kidnap Meghan, first to talk her into taking him back, and if that didn't work, leaving town. But that wasn't all.\n\nMoataz Azzeh: And \u2026 I was like, \"If she doesn't leave, what are you gonna do?\" And he was like, \"I want you to kill her.\"\n\nLeon Jacob: I'm not gonna comment on any of this. It's just ridiculous.\n\nTaz says Leon paid him $9,000 which he happily spent.\n\nMoataz Azzeh: To be honest, I don't feel bad that I spent Jacob's money. Matter of fact, I feel really good that I spent his money [nervous laughter].\n\nThen, the man Leon knew as Zack vanished.\n\nMichael Kubosh: Leon Jacob-- was one of the most unique-- individuals I'd ever met.\n\nMichael Kubosh: This guy was focused \u2026 was very intimidating \u2026 didn't shake my hand, never greeted me, just wanted to know one thing. \"I want Zach's number.\" \u2026He said, \"I've paid Zach a lot of money to take care of this.\" I felt like I was talking to the devil himself.\n\nAN ELABORATE STING\n\nTucked away on a side street in Houston is perhaps the most colorful bail bondsman in all of Texas\n\nPeter Van Sant: Having hung out a bit with you, you are the Elvis of bail bondsmen.\n\nMichael Kubosh: [Laughs].\n\nHis name is Michael Kubosh and he understands the criminal mind.\n\nMichael Kubosh: I deal with the nicest, the kindest and the meanest people on the face of the earth. I've bonded out judges, prostitutes, preachers, missionaries.\n\nHe's also a larger-than-life member of the Houston City Council, who helped save lives during Hurricane Harvey.\n\nMichael Kubosh: I know all the major law enforcement people in -- in the whole county.\n\nLeon had stormed into Kubosh's office.\n\nMichael Kubosh: He said, \"I've paid Zach a lot of money to take care of this.\" \"To take care of what?\" He said, \"I want her out of the picture. And \u2013 and -- and the -- I -- she can't be testifyin' against me.\"\n\nPeter Van Sant: Out of the picture.\n\nMichael Kubosh: Out of the picture. \u2026I believed that he meant ill toward this woman. \u2026And that's why I called the chief\u2026\n\nPeter Van Sant: The chief of?\n\nMichael Kubosh: The chief of police in Houston, Texas.\n\nA search for the mysterious \"Zach\" was triggered, and investigators quickly learned his real name, Moataz \"Taz\" Azzeh. It was a name that Kubosh did recognize as a former military man who was facing a misdemeanor theft charge for stealing from his roommate.\n\nMichael Kubosh: He was on bond with me. He was still free.\n\nIt took Houston police about a week to find Taz, and that's when things got really interesting.\n\nDetective \"Javier\" is an undercover officer with the Houston Police Department.\n\nDet. Javier: To me Taz seemed genuinely concerned for Meghan. He didn't wanna see her hurt.\n\nSo Taz agreed to participate in a sting operation, to help catch Leon Jacob in the act of soliciting a murder:\n\nLeon Jacob [on the phone]: Hello? Moataz Azzeh: Hey, what's up man. Leon Jacob: How you doing buddy?\n\nTaz told Leon that he felt he had grown too close to him and Valerie McDaniel, and thought it best to hire another hit man. And he knew just the right guy:\n\nMoataz Azzeh: Can you can meet tomorrow? Leon Jacob: Yeah, I will clear my schedule.\n\nThe next day, Taz would introduce Leon to his new hit man -- undercover Detective Javier. But before Taz could hang up, Leon dropped a bomb:\n\nLeon Jacob: [On the phone]: We're taking care of both problems? Moataz Azzeh: What problems? Leon Jacob: Both of the individuals we are talking about. Moataz Azzeh: Ah, OK.\n\nValerie McDaniel -- Leon's new girlfriend, the mild mannered veterinarian who friends had described as an angel -- wanted her ex-husband murdered.\n\nLeon Jacob [On the phone]: Valerie wants to talk to you about what she wants done with her ex-husband. Moataz Azzeh: OK that's good \u2026 alright, just bring her with you tomorrow.\n\nThe next day, Leon and Valerie met with Taz and Detective Javier at an Olive Garden to discuss the fate of both their exes over lunch.\n\nDet. Javier: \u2026the entire operation was recorded.\n\nThe meeting lasted nearly two hours and began with Leon's target: Meghan:\n\nOLIVE GARDEN MEETING: Leon Jacob: I don't want her hurt, but I want her to go.\n\nDet. Javier: He told me that he wanted me to run her off the road and threaten her\u2026 But then \u2026 he would say to me, \"If she does not understand that, then you do what you have to do.\"\n\nOLIVE GARDEN MEETING: Leon Jacob: If those options don't work, I don't give a f--- \u2026then you gotta do what you gotta do \u2026 I need her gone\u2026\n\nDet. Javier: There was no doubt in my mind that Leon wanted Meghan killed.\n\nThe subject then turned to Valerie's target: her ex-husband, Mack McDaniel:\n\nOLIVE GARDEN MEETING: Valerie McDaniel: Let's say if something were to happen to him, what would it be? Would it be like a car wreck or\u2026? Det. Javier: It could be a car wreck. It could be a robbery gone wrong.\n\nDet. Javier: She was under the belief that I was going to carjack him \u2026 and I was going to put a bullet in his head, which is exactly what I told her I was going to do.\n\nOLIVE GARDEN MEETING: Det. Javier: But you need to give me the go ahead. Want to do that? Valerie McDaniel: What other option do I have? He's going to take my daughter.\n\nThe next day, March 9, 2017, Detective Javier called Leon to say he had \"good\" news that he insisted on delivering in person. He went to their home where he informed them Mack was dead. Neither wanted to see a photo which seemed to show Mack with a gunshot to the head.\n\nPeter Van Sant: When Valerie got the news that her husband was dead, was she emotional about it? Did she say, \"Oh my God, I never wanted to go this far?\"\n\nDet. Javier: She did not show that.\n\nWhat they didn't know is that Mack was alive and well. He'd posed for the photos as part of this elaborate sting operation. Believing Mack was dead, Leon set his sights back on Meghan:\n\nLeon Jacob: So you're gonna snatch her and you're bring her somewhere and talk to her. Det. Javier: That's the plan. Leon Jacob: If I need to show up, you call me.\n\nLater that night, staged photographs of Meghan were texted to Leon. He was told she was so out of control, she had to be killed:\n\nDet. Javier: She's dead. She's gone. Leon Jacob: I don't want to know anything.\n\nPeter Van Sant: On that scale of good to evil, in your mind what is Leon Jacob?\n\nDet. Javier: Leon is a very evil person. \u2026he was willing to do whatever he needed to do to survive.\n\nA SURREAL SCENE\n\nSgt. Frank Quinn | Houston Police Dept.: It was probably around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.\n\nOn March 10, 2017, Valerie McDaniel and her live-in boyfriend, Leon Jacob, get a wake-up call from Sergeant Frank Quinn that will soon lead to an Oscar-winning performance.\n\nValerie McDaniel: [Opens door to police]: What's going on?\n\nSamantha Knecht | Harris County Assistant D.A.: She lets them inside but she feigns surprise. She can't understand why they're there.\n\nRemember, just hours before, Detective Javier, posing as a hit man, had told her that Mack was dead. Now, Valerie has to convince police she is hearing it for the first time:\n\nSgt. Frank Quinn [to Valerie]: Sorry to have to tell you. Have you heard from him recently?\n\nSamantha Knecht: She pretends to be upset. She puts her head in her hands. She sits down and acts like she's completely shocked and surprised that her ex-husband is dead.\n\nSgt. Frank Quinn: Is your boyfriend here? I think he can be a little help to us now. Valerie McDaniel: Sure.\n\nThe surreal scene, caught by the body cameras of Houston police, is about to reach its climax:\n\nSgt. Frank Quinn We were hoping you could help us. We have some bad news. Her ex-husband was killed\u2026 Leon Jacob: Oh my God! Sgt. Frank Quinn: \u2026in a robbery gone wrong. Leon Jacob: Holy s---! Sgt. Frank Quinn: We want to see if anyone knows anything. Leon Jacob [puts his arms around Valerie]: Are you OK, baby? Leon Jacob: We've been here all day with their daughter. We've been watching movies. We haven't been out of the house all day.\n\nThen, the cops decide to call \"cut!\" on all this bad acting:\n\nSgt. Frank Quinn: Right now we're gonna read you your rights\u2026 Leon Jacob: Me? Sgt. Frank Quinn: \u2026because you're both being arrested for solicitation of capital murder.\n\nIt is only then that the couple learns that both their intended targets are alive and well.\n\nLeon Jacob: I don't know why I'm being arrested.\n\nLeon is led out.\n\nLeon Jacob: I need my sweatshirt. I'm already cold.\n\nValerie has a much bigger concern: her daughter who's been asleep in the apartment this whole time. Although not caught on camera, Mack McDaniel arrives to pick up their 8-year-old.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What did Valerie say to her?\n\nSgt. Frank Quinn: She -- you know, something along the lines, \"I'm just -- taking you \u2013 to -- your daddy's outside and he's gonna take ya.\" And it was very benign and, you know, just normal as could be.\n\nHarris County Sheriff's Office\n\nMichael Kubosh | Bail bondsman: And so all of the sudden on the news media came the arrest of two doctors.\n\nGreg Holloway | Valerie's friend: I'm laying there thinking, \"Well, that's not the Valerie I know.\" And they showed the film of her going up for her arraignment.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did you about fall out of your chair?\n\nGreg Holloway: Almost rolled outta the bed!\n\nBecause Leon has those other charges related to Meghan Verikas pending, he doesn't make bail. But Valerie does and goes home to wait for the legal process to play out.\n\nDr. Brittany King | Valerie's coworker: I remember texting her throughout the week, you know, and calling her and constantly sending her \"I love you, you can get through this, so happy you're out.\"\n\nValerie's veterinary license got suspended because of the charges. King says Valerie was weighed down by her arrest, and the prospect she wouldn't be seeing her daughter for a long, long time. She visited Valerie at her high-rise condo.\n\nDr. Brittany King: I remember giving her a hug goodbye at the end. And I just felt the life in her eyes was not there.\n\nValerie McDaniel audio diary: It's weird. Things -- it wasn't like bam, bam, bam, a progression. Things just gradually happened.\n\nTwo weeks after the shock and shame of being charged with solicitation of capital murder, Valerie McDaniel used her iPad to record her side of the story:\n\nValerie McDaniel audio diary: I didn't wake up one day and just say, \"Hey, I wanna kill my ex-husband.\"\n\nFor Valerie, everything she loved was slipping away.\n\nValerie McDaniel audio diary: I wanna talk to my daughter. I wanna talk to Leon. \u2026I'm just not strong enough. I wish I were. I just can't do it. Just can't do it.\"\n\nTwo days after her final recording, on March 27, 2017, Valerie -- who once seemed unstoppable -- did the unthinkable. She climbed over the railing of her apartment balcony and jumped seven stories to her death.\n\nLeon Jacob: I was shocked. It was really upsetting. \u2026She wanted me to be home with her and that, you know, we were gonna get through this. \u2026It was devastating and shocking.\n\nSamantha Knecht |Harris County Assistant D.A.: I think that she was in a very vulnerable position when she met Leon Jacob. \u2026but I think he influenced her and brainwashed her.\n\nLeon Jacob: I'm innocent and as a human being and as a physician, that thought of killing somebody else is, just goes against everything in my nature.\n\nLeon has hired one of the top defense attorneys in Texas, George Parnham, who says Valerie McDaniel was the one calling all the shots.\n\nGeorge Parnham: I am -- am sorry for her demise. But \u2026 I believe that Valerie -- is and was responsible for this entire scenario.\n\nPeter Van Sant: That she was the driver? \u2026she was the financier of all of this?\n\nGeorge Parnham: That is my understanding.\n\nThe question now: what will a jury think? On March 20, 2018, a week before the first anniversary of Valerie's suicide, Leon alone stands trial on two counts of solicitation of capital murder.\n\nCameron Calligan [in court]: One of the things you'll learn about Leon Jacob is that he has to be in control. \u2026Mack was going to die, and Meghan was going to die.\n\nCameron Calligan is Samantha Knecht's co-prosecutor. He says Leon's motive was clear.\n\nCameron Calligan [in court]: There were two obstacles to the defendant's new life with Valerie McDaniel. It was Mack and it was Meghan. Mack could keep Valerie away from him by making Valerie choose between the defendant and her daughter, and Meghan could make him end up in prison.\n\nGeorge Parnham's co-counsel, Matthew Pospisil, claims that it was the undercover officer, whose identity \"48 Hours\" is protecting by calling Detective Javier, who pushed Valerie and Leon to make a deadly choice.\n\nMatthew Pospisil [in court]: If it was not for Officer ***** trying to make this into a television story and force his own narrative, Leon would not be forced here today to tell his story.\n\nTestimony begins with some of the early stops on this long road to justice, starting with Meghan Verikas.\n\nMichael Kubosh: He didn't want her to testify against him and he had paid somebody a lot of money to make sure that she wouldn't be here to testify against him.\n\nMoataz Azzeh: He wanted to make her disappear. \u2026he wanted her gone, like dead.\n\nBefore the trial concludes, two potential victims will rise from the dead to take the stand and the jury will hear from Leon who says he's only guilty of being a Casanova.\n\nLeon Jacob: I have no problem sitting here and saying that I slept with Valerie seven days after Meghan and I broke up, but I am not on trial for being a womanizer. I am on trial for solicitation of capital murder. So you can assassinate my character all you want up here, it doesn't make me guilty of what you are charging.\n\nON TRIAL\n\nOne of the prosecution's strongest witnesses, Meghan Verikas -- Leon's ex-girlfriend who had filed assault charges against him in January 2017 -- takes the stand\n\nMeghan Verikas: It was a long time coming. I tried to leave several times.\n\nShe recalls Leon coming to the house where she was staying just after the alleged incident.\n\nMeghan Verikas: I obviously didn't wanna be near him. So I hid in a closet.\n\nSamantha Knecht: Why did you hide in a closet?\n\nMeghan Verikas: Because I was afraid of Leon. \u2026He came in and was screaming and yelling \u2026 And he said, \"I know that you're -- I know that that bitch is here.\"\n\nMeghan says Leon kept pursuing her when she was at work:\n\nMeghan Verikas: He was in the bushes outside-- on a cell phone-- waiting for me.\n\nAnd when she drove to her new home.\n\nMeghan Verikas: At that point I called 911 to let them know that, you know, my ex-boyfriend who assaulted me was -- in a car behind me. \u2026At some point -- Leon had gotten out of his vehicle in front of mine just yelling and waving his hands sayin', \"You know, just talk to me. Just talk to me. I need to talk to you.\"\n\nLeon was arrested a second time, on stalking charges, on Feb. 16, 2017. Less than 10 days after that, Meghan Verikas was contacted by police and warned her life could be in danger. She fled to her hometown of Pittsburgh, but police soon called her to return to Houston to be part of that sting operation.\n\nMeghan Verikas: I sat in a chair in a warehouse.\n\nMeghan Verikas: They zip tied my hands and my feet -- and put duct tape around my mouth to -- make me look as if I had been kidnapped. \u2026I was crying and really upset.\n\nNext, it was Valerie's ex-husband Mack McDaniel's turn. He recalled finding out his ex-wife was living with Leon.\n\nSamantha Knecht: What was your initial reaction to that?\n\nMack McDaniel: My initial reaction was not good.\n\nSamantha Knecht: Why was that?\n\nMack McDaniel: Because I was aware of his history, his criminal history.\n\nSamantha Knecht: Did you convey to Valerie that you did not want the defendant around your daughter on the weeks that she had custody of *******?\n\nMack McDaniel: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSamantha Knecht: Did she agree to that?\n\nMack McDaniel: She did.\n\nSamantha Knecht: At some point, did you learn that she was not abiding by the agreement?\n\nMack McDaniel: I did.\n\nMack McDaniel tells the jury he, too, was notified he was the target of a murder plot. Then the prosecution shows the jury that photo:\n\nSamantha Knecht: Can you describe for the members of the jury what you're doing here?\n\nMack McDaniel: Staging my own death.\n\nSamantha Knecht: Did they pour blood on you?\n\nMack McDaniel: Pig's blood.\n\nThree days into the five-day trial, it's the defense's turn. They call their star witness:\n\nLeon Jacob: I never asked anybody to kill anybody.\n\nGeorge Parnham: Does the word kill, hurt, harm in any way, shape, or form appear in any of those recorded conversations?\n\nLeon Jacob: Not on my behalf. \u2026Except for to exclude them from things I want done. I never asked to have anybody hurt, killed, harmed, kidnapped. I never asked for anybody to be in any way physically hurt.\n\nUndercover cop: She's dead. She's gone.\n\nLeon Jacob: I don't want to know anything.\n\nBut the prosecution says that's not true. And they claim those undercover tapes back that up.\n\nSamantha Knecht: Did you not want anybody hurt when you said inject her with potassium chloride, stop her heart, untraceable?\n\nLeon Jacob: I said that was something you could do. I didn't say that for him to do that.\n\nSamantha Knecht: Did you recall telling the undercover office, \"if those options don't work, I don't give a f---.Then you got to do what you got to do because my survival is more important?\"\n\nLeon Jacob: Yes.\n\nLeon's own words come back to haunt him regarding Mack as well. After the undercover officer proposed a fatal carjacking, [Undercover cop: It could be a robbery gone wrong.] Leon offered $10,000 in four weekly installments.\n\nPool\n\nSamantha Knecht: OK, so you agreeing you gave him $2,500 just after he tells you, I am going to put a bullet in his head and throw him on the street.\n\nLeon Jacob: If that's what you say.\n\nSamantha: Well that's in the recording. It's not what I say. It's what Javier and you said, right?\n\nLeon Jacob: I guess.\n\nLeon and the defense team try to make their point that the undercover officer was pressuring them into making deadly decisions.\n\nLeon Jacob: I kept on telling him I didn't want anybody hurt and they kept on going back to the theme of killing people \u2026 I felt a lot of pressure from them to sort of commit to this idea of killing people and that was never my intent.\n\nMatthew Pospisil: Were you asking them to threaten people?\n\nLeon Jacob: Essentially, yes.\n\nMatthew Pospisil: Did you actually want any harm to come to anybody?\n\nLeon Jacob: No.\n\nBut the prosecution points out that when Leon thought Meghan was tied up and refusing to cooperate, he did nothing to stop the lethal final step.\n\nSamantha Knecht: You would agree with me that you never said no-no I don't want you to do anything, stop this. You didn't say anything like that did you?\n\nLeon Jacob: No.\n\nThe jury gets the case and takes just an hour and 15 minutes before returning to the courtroom.\n\nJudge: Has the jury reached unanimous verdicts on both cases?\n\nJury foreperson: Yes, Your honor. \u2026We the jury find the defendant Leon Jacob guilty of solicitation of capital murder as charged in the indictment.\n\nLeon Jacob is found guilty on both counts of conspiring to have Meghan and Mack killed. The trial moves to the sentencing phase. The same jury that found Leon guilty will decide his punishment.\n\nNew testimony begins.\n\nMeghan Verikas: I have no sense of trust, just constantly afraid that something else is going to happen.\n\nThe only thing that might impact Leon's sentence more than the words of his ex-girlfriend may end up being the words of his ex-wife.\n\nAnnie Morrison has flown in from Chicago to testify.\n\nAnnie Morrison: There was a time that we got into a fight and he pulled a knife on me.\n\nAnnie Morrison: There was one time he pushed my head down onto the counter and bruised my face near my eye.\n\nMorrison recounts an incident she says occurred when she was seven months pregnant with their second child:\n\nAnnie Morrison: He threatened to punch me in the stomach. He kicked my legs. I remember \u2026 I remember bringing my legs up as far as I could towards my chest to try to protect my stomach.\n\nAnnie Morrison: He threatened that if I ever left that he would kill me. He said that nobody would ever find my body because he was a doctor and he had access to chemicals that would dissolve my body.\n\nMorrison did leave, moving to her parents' home in Chicago. That's when Leon started threatening her parents -- as the jury heard in a recording Annie made of a phone call with Leon:\n\nLeon Jacob phonecall: I will torture them in front of you. Do you understand me, you f*****g bitch.\n\nThe jury took just one hour to decide Leon Jacob's sentence: life in prison on each count -- solicitation of capital murder for Meghan Verikas and Mack McDaniel.\n\nPool\n\nIn Texas, the victim impact statements come after the sentence. Meghan takes the stand one last time.\n\nMeghan Verikas: You will never see your children grow up. You will not be a part of their lives and they will be better for it. \u2026You destroyed me financially and took away my sense of security but you can do that no more.\n\nMeghan Verikas: While you sit in jail I hope you think of me, the girl that you called poor and uneducated. Because it's because of me you will be in prison for life.\n\nLeon Jacob will be eligible for parole in the year 2047. He will be 69 years old."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Peter Van Sant", "title": "Houston doctor charged in murder-for-hire plot goes to trial", "description": "\"48 Hours\" has the latest in the investigation into the alleged plot launched by two Houston doctors and their relationship with a former U.S. Army soldier who pretended to take a hit job", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/houston-doctor-leon-jacob-charged-in-murder-for-hire-plot-goes-to-trial/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/10/13/b13c23ac-0467-4d31-8164-be9752c255db/thumbnail/1200x630/12c4a0bc6e4cb8ad3491b2e04c1958ee/mcdaniel-jacob-hero.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T21:38:55Z", "content": "Produced by Susan Mallie, Judy Rybak, Ryan Smith and Claire St. Amant [This story first aired on Oct. 17, 2017.

Jacob was an up-and-coming doctor with plenty of confidence. She was newly single after getting a divorce from her ex-husband Marion \"Mack\" McDaniel. But there were some problems.\n\nThe McDaniels were in the midst of an ugly custody battle, while Leon Jacob was facing felony charges for stalking an ex-girlfriend. If found guilty on those charges, it could have upended his medical career.\n\nHouston Police say that's when Leon Jacob sought the help of someone he thought was a hit man to eliminate the problems.\n\nDELIVERING BAD NEWS\n\nIt's 3 a.m. on Friday, March 10, 2017. Houston police are making their way to the seventh-floor condo of beloved veterinarian Valerie McDaniel:\n\nSgt. Frank Quinn | Houston Police Dept.: I'm afraid I have some bad news.\n\nHouston P.D.\n\nBad doesn't begin to describe what's about to be revealed:\n\nSgt. Frank Quinn: Uh, your, your, your, uh, ex-husband has been found with what looks like um, turns out to be a fatality. Looks like it might've been a robbery gone wrong. Sorry I have to tell you.\n\n[Valerie hangs her head in her hands and cries]\n\nValerie McDaniel's ex-husband, Mack, police tell her, was dead -- just six months after their divorce had become final.\n\nSgt. Frank Quinn: Do you have anyone to call to\u2026help you, to stay with you?\n\nBut how could Valerie's life have arrived at this dreadful moment?\n\nValerie earned her degree in veterinary medicine at Texas A&M. It was during that time she met Mack McDaniel.\n\nGreg Holloway | Valerie's friend: My impression of Mack is that he was a good man. He was a stand-up guy.\n\nMack proposed, and Valerie had the man of her dreams -- as she describes in that recording of her memories:\n\nValerie McDaniel audio diary: We had a beautiful, fairytale wedding. \u2026Moved into a house that my parents had bought for me to live in.\n\nNot long after that Valerie decided to open her own clinic.\n\nCody Bernard | Valeries' cousin: I admired her. It really, you know, it sunk something inside me. I wanted to do that one day, something big, you know?\n\nMack was her office manager, but even as the vet clinic thrived, the two longed for something more.\n\nCody Bernard: She couldn't have any children. \u2026So the only option was to adopt.\n\nIn 2008, the couple adopted a daughter when she was just two days old. But as their new family came together, their marriage began to fall apart. It started, Valerie claims, with a phone call from a stranger -- the woman who claimed to have been Mack's lover. But Valerie says that wasn't all:\n\nValerie McDaniel audio diary: She gave me lists of women that he had slept with...\n\nValerie says she confronted Mack \u2026 and forgave him. But claims it wasn't long before Mack cheated again:\n\nValerie McDaniel audio: \u2026And that was the first time I ever said the word \"divorce.\" \u2026and I yelled it at him outside and I yelled it and yelled it.\n\nValerie says she forgave Mack yet again. But then a chance encounter would change the course of her life. Leon Jacob, the son of Valerie's neighbor, divorce attorney Golda Jacob, stopped by.\n\nValerie McDaniel audio: He ran up to me and stuck his hand out and introduced himself. The cockiest mother-----r I'd ever met in my life.\n\nLeon Jacob: Valerie was in her mid-forties but she was stunning both inside and out.\n\nThe attraction was mutual.\n\nValerie McDaniel audio diary: You could tell he knew how beautiful he was. \u2026And I was lonely.\n\nLeon Jacob was eight years younger than Valerie and a doctor.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What type of surgeries have you done?\n\nLeon Jacob: All kinds of surgeries. \u2026I've assisted in heart, kidney, pancreas transplants.\n\nWith a strained home life and an attractive new friend, what happened next may have been inevitable.\n\nValerie McDaniel audio diary: He sat across from me and we had some wine and I had my feet out on the chair next to him. \u2026And out of the blue he reached out and just ran his finger up my left foot. And that was it. \u2026It was like a movie moment.\n\nPeter Van Sant: It's quite an interlude according to what she described.\n\nLeon Jacob: Yeah. Compliments all around, I guess.\n\nIn December 2014, Valerie filed for divorce claiming Mack committed adultery. Mack's attorneys told \"48 Hours\" Mack had no comment about the divorce petition and the claims Valerie made in her audio diary.\n\nBetween Mack's alleged cheating and Valerie's new love interest, both wanted out of the marriage. Their divorce was finalized in August 2016. Valerie and her daughter moved into a building in the upscale River Oaks area of Houston. Not long after, Leon joined them there.\n\nLeon Jacob: The relationship really blossomed quickly. Because we had been very close friends for so long.\n\nDr. Brittany King worked alongside Valerie at the vet clinic.\n\nDr. Brittany King: They seemed very much in love. \u2026Holding hands and loving towards each other.\n\nBut there was one old problem in Valerie and Leon's new relationship. And his name was Mack.\n\nDr. Brittany King: There were multiple times in the clinic where she would just be in tears. \"Is everything OK?\" And it was something or surrounding her ex-husband.\n\nValerie McDaniel audio diary: Mack had found out that Leon was staying with me.\n\nCody Bernard: There would be arguments or stuff with the child \u2026 with visitation.\n\nBut Leon had his own issues with past loves -- one involving extreme mental cruelty and another -- assault and stalking charges.\n\nSamantha Knecht is a Harris County Assistant District Attorney.\n\nSamantha Knecht: Leon Jacob is a predator. He's scary. \u2026He wants what he wants and he'll stop at nothing to get it.\n\nCould there be more to Valerie's new love than she can imagine?\n\nSamantha Knecht: He has no problem using women. In fact, I think he enjoys it.\n\nA DIABOLICAL PLAN\n\nValerie McDaniel's new live-in boyfriend grew up in Texas-sized world of beauty and opulence.\n\nLeon Jacob: I always wanted to be a doctor my whole life ever since I was about 3 or 4.\n\nAs he pursued his degrees, Leon met and married his college sweetheart. They had two boys.\n\nLeon Jacob: We had a happy, loving family. \u2026I got two boys \u2026 they're the most important things to me in my life.\n\nA good family, and now with an M.D. after his name, Leon was well on his way.\n\nBut Leon's picture-perfect life disguised a troubled relationship. After 12 years of marriage, his wife filed for divorce. citing \"extreme mental cruelty.\" And one year later, Leon was arrested for stalking his now-ex.\n\nSamantha Knecht: Leon has to be in control \u2026 when his ex-wife went to end their relationship he wasn't gonna have it -- and he wasn't gonna go down without a fight.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Leon, isn't it true that you've had brushes with the law involving stalking, cyberstalking, intimidation\u2014physical harassment, assault? Aren't all those true?\n\nLeon Jacob: I pled guilty to an attempted cyber harassment charge that was stemming from an acrimonious divorce that I went through with my previous wife.\n\nLeon admits that he called often, but he says it was simply speak with his boys.\n\nLeon Jacob: I tried desperately to contact my kids over and over again. I'm not gonna apologize for that.\n\nLeon finally moved on to a new residency, and was living in Pittsburgh, where he met 33-year-old Meghan Verikas.\n\nLeon Jacob: I met Meghan in a hotel -- in Pittsburgh \u2026 She was the assistant general manager there.\n\nThe new couple moved to Houston. There were lavish vacations, and family get-togethers, and yet another residency, Leon's seventh.\n\nSamantha Knecht: He's a failed doctor... He's been kicked out of every residency program he's ever been a part of.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And what's the problem? What was the basis of these dismissals, do you know?\n\nSamantha Knecht: The belief that he was the smartest guy in the room. Inability to get along with people \u2026 Inability to get along with patients. And in fact, one of the records that we found said that they believe that he was a danger to the patients and that he would be a liability for them to keep around.\n\nThree years into their relationship, Meghan Verikas thought Leon was a threat to her, too. Meghan kicked Leon out of their apartment, later accusing him of assaulting her.\n\nLeon Jacob: She wanted me to move all my stuff out \u2026 she came there and was very hostile. The police were called. There was no violence of any kind. \u2026And a day later, she claimed that I had hit her.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And that you'd put a hand over her mouth.\n\nLeon Jacob: Yeah, which is not true.\n\nSamantha Knecht: Leon is about Leon and it frustrated him to no end that Meghan Verikos would not forgive him \u2026 and the fact that he couldn't get Meghan back frustrated him and angered him.\n\nLeon was arrested in February 2007 for assault and stalking.\n\nLeon Jacob: \u2026 you can charge anybody with anything; it doesn't mean that you're guilty of that.\n\nProsecutors are convinced that Leon knew his future as a doctor would be destroyed if Meghan testified against him. So, they believe, he planned a little operation to make his pain go away.\n\nSamantha Knecht: He feels like if Meghan disappears \u2026 if she goes away \u2026 that his criminal case will go away, and he can resume his career as this beloved surgeon that he thinks that he is.\n\nProsecutors claim Leon decided what he needed was a hit man. And he thought he'd found one.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Taz, are you a hit man?\n\nMoataz Azzeh: No.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Were you ever willing to murder anyone for money?\n\nMoataz Azzeh: No, no. No. I would never do something like that.\n\nTaz Azzeh was introduced to Leon by a mutual acquaintance.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did Leon ever tell you how he wanted his ex-girlfriend to be killed?\n\nMoataz Azzeh: Yes \u2026 he actually -- offered suggestions. One of 'em was a syringe to the heart with potassium, to give her a heart attack and would actually kill her.\n\nTaz is a decorated former U.S. Army soldier, who saw Leon's deadly demand as an opportunity to save a life.\n\nMoataz Azzeh: I saw somebody in danger and I knew that I can do somethin' about it and I did something about it.\n\nLeon knew Taz by the codename Zack. He says Leon wanted him to kidnap Meghan, first to talk her into taking him back, and if that didn't work, leaving town. But that wasn't all.\n\nMoataz Azzeh: And \u2026 I was like, \"If she doesn't leave, what are you gonna do?\" And he was like, \"I want you to kill her.\"\n\nLeon Jacob: I'm not gonna comment on any of this. It's just ridiculous.\n\nTaz says Leon paid him $9,000 which he happily spent.\n\nMoataz Azzeh: To be honest, I don't feel bad that I spent Jacob's money. Matter of fact, I feel really good that I spent his money [nervous laughter].\n\nThen, the man Leon knew as Zack vanished.\n\nMichael Kubosh: Leon Jacob-- was one of the most unique-- individuals I'd ever met.\n\nMichael Kubosh: This guy was focused \u2026 was very intimidating \u2026 didn't shake my hand, never greeted me, just wanted to know one thing. \"I want Zach's number.\" \u2026He said, \"I've paid Zach a lot of money to take care of this.\" I felt like I was talking to the devil himself.\n\nAN ELABORATE STING\n\nTucked away on a side street in Houston is perhaps the most colorful bail bondsman in all of Texas\n\nPeter Van Sant: Having hung out a bit with you, you are the Elvis of bail bondsmen.\n\nMichael Kubosh: [Laughs].\n\nHis name is Michael Kubosh and he understands the criminal mind.\n\nMichael Kubosh: I deal with the nicest, the kindest and the meanest people on the face of the earth. I've bonded out judges, prostitutes, preachers, missionaries.\n\nHe's also a larger-than-life member of the Houston City Council, who helped save lives during Hurricane Harvey.\n\nMichael Kubosh: I know all the major law enforcement people in -- in the whole county.\n\nLeon had stormed into Kubosh's office.\n\nMichael Kubosh: He said, \"I've paid Zach a lot of money to take care of this.\" \"To take care of what?\" He said, \"I want her out of the picture. And \u2013 and -- and the -- I -- she can't be testifyin' against me.\"\n\nPeter Van Sant: Out of the picture.\n\nMichael Kubosh: Out of the picture. \u2026I believed that he meant ill toward this woman. \u2026And that's why I called the chief\u2026\n\nPeter Van Sant: The chief of?\n\nMichael Kubosh: The chief of police in Houston, Texas.\n\nA search for the mysterious \"Zach\" was triggered, and investigators quickly learned his real name, Moataz \"Taz\" Azzeh. It was a name that Kubosh did recognize as a former military man who was facing a misdemeanor theft charge for stealing from his roommate.\n\nMichael Kubosh: He was on bond with me. He was still free.\n\nIt took Houston police about a week to find Taz, and that's when things got really interesting.\n\nDetective \"Javier\" is an undercover officer with the Houston Police Department.\n\nDet. Javier: To me Taz seemed genuinely concerned for Meghan. He didn't wanna see her hurt.\n\nSo Taz agreed to participate in a sting operation, to help catch Leon Jacob in the act of soliciting a murder:\n\nLeon Jacob [on the phone]: Hello? Moataz Azzeh: Hey, what's up man. Leon Jacob: How you doing buddy?\n\nTaz told Leon that he felt he had grown too close to him and Valerie McDaniel, and thought it best to hire another hit man. And he knew just the right guy:\n\nMoataz Azzeh: Can you can meet tomorrow? Leon Jacob: Yeah, I will clear my schedule.\n\nThe next day, Taz would introduce Leon to his new hit man -- undercover Detective Javier. But before Taz could hang up, Leon dropped a bomb:\n\nLeon Jacob: [On the phone]: We're taking care of both problems? Moataz Azzeh: What problems? Leon Jacob: Both of the individuals we are talking about. Moataz Azzeh: Ah, OK.\n\nValerie McDaniel -- Leon's new girlfriend, the mild mannered veterinarian who friends had described as an angel -- wanted her ex-husband murdered.\n\nLeon Jacob [On the phone]: Valerie wants to talk to you about what she wants done with her ex-husband. Moataz Azzeh: OK that's good \u2026 alright, just bring her with you tomorrow.\n\nThe next day, Leon and Valerie met with Taz and Detective Javier at an Olive Garden to discuss the fate of both their exes over lunch.\n\nDet. Javier: \u2026the entire operation was recorded.\n\nThe meeting lasted nearly two hours and began with Leon's target: Meghan:\n\nOLIVE GARDEN MEETING: Leon Jacob: I don't want her hurt, but I want her to go.\n\nDet. Javier: He told me that he wanted me to run her off the road and threaten her\u2026 But then \u2026 he would say to me, \"If she does not understand that, then you do what you have to do.\"\n\nOLIVE GARDEN MEETING: Leon Jacob: If those options don't work, I don't give a f--- \u2026then you gotta do what you gotta do \u2026 I need her gone\u2026\n\nDet. Javier: There was no doubt in my mind that Leon wanted Meghan killed.\n\nThe subject then turned to Valerie's target: her ex-husband, Mack McDaniel:\n\nOLIVE GARDEN MEETING: Valerie McDaniel: Let's say if something were to happen to him, what would it be? Would it be like a car wreck or\u2026? Det. Javier: It could be a car wreck. It could be a robbery gone wrong.\n\nDet. Javier: She was under the belief that I was going to carjack him \u2026 and I was going to put a bullet in his head, which is exactly what I told her I was going to do.\n\nOLIVE GARDEN MEETING: Det. Javier: But you need to give me the go ahead. Want to do that? Valerie McDaniel: What other option do I have? He's going to take my daughter.\n\nThe next day, March 9, 2017, Detective Javier called Leon to say he had \"good\" news that he insisted on delivering in person. He went to their home where he informed them Mack was dead. Neither wanted to see a photo which seemed to show Mack with a gunshot to the head.\n\nPeter Van Sant: When Valerie got the news that her husband was dead, was she emotional about it? Did she say, \"Oh my God, I never wanted to go this far?\"\n\nDet. Javier: She did not show that.\n\nWhat they didn't know is that Mack was alive and well. He'd posed for the photos as part of this elaborate sting operation. Believing Mack was dead, Leon set his sights back on Meghan:\n\nLeon Jacob: So you're gonna snatch her and you're bring her somewhere and talk to her. Det. Javier: That's the plan. Leon Jacob: If I need to show up, you call me.\n\nLater that night, staged photographs of Meghan were texted to Leon. He was told she was so out of control, she had to be killed:\n\nDet. Javier: She's dead. She's gone. Leon Jacob: I don't want to know anything.\n\nPeter Van Sant: On that scale of good to evil, in your mind what is Leon Jacob?\n\nDet. Javier: Leon is a very evil person. \u2026he was willing to do whatever he needed to do to survive.\n\nA SURREAL SCENE\n\nSgt. Frank Quinn | Houston Police Dept.: It was probably around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.\n\nOn March 10, 2017, Valerie McDaniel and her live-in boyfriend, Leon Jacob, get a wake-up call from Sergeant Frank Quinn that will soon lead to an Oscar-winning performance.\n\nValerie McDaniel: [Opens door to police]: What's going on?\n\nSamantha Knecht | Harris County Assistant D.A.: She lets them inside but she feigns surprise. She can't understand why they're there.\n\nRemember, just hours before, Detective Javier, posing as a hit man, had told her that Mack was dead. Now, Valerie has to convince police she is hearing it for the first time:\n\nSgt. Frank Quinn [to Valerie]: Sorry to have to tell you. Have you heard from him recently?\n\nSamantha Knecht: She pretends to be upset. She puts her head in her hands. She sits down and acts like she's completely shocked and surprised that her ex-husband is dead.\n\nSgt. Frank Quinn: Is your boyfriend here? I think he can be a little help to us now. Valerie McDaniel: Sure.\n\nThe surreal scene, caught by the body cameras of Houston police, is about to reach its climax:\n\nSgt. Frank Quinn We were hoping you could help us. We have some bad news. Her ex-husband was killed\u2026 Leon Jacob: Oh my God! Sgt. Frank Quinn: \u2026in a robbery gone wrong. Leon Jacob: Holy s---! Sgt. Frank Quinn: We want to see if anyone knows anything. Leon Jacob [puts his arms around Valerie]: Are you OK, baby? Leon Jacob: We've been here all day with their daughter. We've been watching movies. We haven't been out of the house all day.\n\nThen, the cops decide to call \"cut!\" on all this bad acting:\n\nSgt. Frank Quinn: Right now we're gonna read you your rights\u2026 Leon Jacob: Me? Sgt. Frank Quinn: \u2026because you're both being arrested for solicitation of capital murder.\n\nIt is only then that the couple learns that both their intended targets are alive and well.\n\nLeon Jacob: I don't know why I'm being arrested.\n\nLeon is led out.\n\nLeon Jacob: I need my sweatshirt. I'm already cold.\n\nValerie has a much bigger concern: her daughter who's been asleep in the apartment this whole time. Although not caught on camera, Mack McDaniel arrives to pick up their 8-year-old.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What did Valerie say to her?\n\nSgt. Frank Quinn: She -- you know, something along the lines, \"I'm just -- taking you \u2013 to -- your daddy's outside and he's gonna take ya.\" And it was very benign and, you know, just normal as could be.\n\nHarris County Sheriff's Office\n\nMichael Kubosh | Bail bondsman: And so all of the sudden on the news media came the arrest of two doctors.\n\nGreg Holloway | Valerie's friend: I'm laying there thinking, \"Well, that's not the Valerie I know.\" And they showed the film of her going up for her arraignment.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did you about fall out of your chair?\n\nGreg Holloway: Almost rolled outta the bed!\n\nBecause Leon has those other charges related to Meghan Verikas pending, he doesn't make bail. But Valerie does and goes home to wait for the legal process to play out.\n\nDr. Brittany King | Valerie's coworker: I remember texting her throughout the week, you know, and calling her and constantly sending her \"I love you, you can get through this, so happy you're out.\"\n\nValerie's veterinary license got suspended because of the charges. King says Valerie was weighed down by her arrest, and the prospect she wouldn't be seeing her daughter for a long, long time. She visited Valerie at her high-rise condo.\n\nDr. Brittany King: I remember giving her a hug goodbye at the end. And I just felt the life in her eyes was not there.\n\nValerie McDaniel audio diary: It's weird. Things -- it wasn't like bam, bam, bam, a progression. Things just gradually happened.\n\nTwo weeks after the shock and shame of being charged with solicitation of capital murder, Valerie McDaniel used her iPad to record her side of the story:\n\nValerie McDaniel audio diary: I didn't wake up one day and just say, \"Hey, I wanna kill my ex-husband.\"\n\nFor Valerie, everything she loved was slipping away.\n\nValerie McDaniel audio diary: I wanna talk to my daughter. I wanna talk to Leon. \u2026I'm just not strong enough. I wish I were. I just can't do it. Just can't do it.\"\n\nTwo days after her final recording, on March 27, 2017, Valerie -- who once seemed unstoppable -- did the unthinkable. She climbed over the railing of her apartment balcony and jumped seven stories to her death.\n\nLeon Jacob: I was shocked. It was really upsetting. \u2026She wanted me to be home with her and that, you know, we were gonna get through this. \u2026It was devastating and shocking.\n\nSamantha Knecht |Harris County Assistant D.A.: I think that she was in a very vulnerable position when she met Leon Jacob. \u2026but I think he influenced her and brainwashed her.\n\nLeon Jacob: I'm innocent and as a human being and as a physician, that thought of killing somebody else is, just goes against everything in my nature.\n\nLeon has hired one of the top defense attorneys in Texas, George Parnham, who says Valerie McDaniel was the one calling all the shots.\n\nGeorge Parnham: I am -- am sorry for her demise. But \u2026 I believe that Valerie -- is and was responsible for this entire scenario.\n\nPeter Van Sant: That she was the driver? \u2026she was the financier of all of this?\n\nGeorge Parnham: That is my understanding.\n\nThe question now: what will a jury think? On March 20, 2018, a week before the first anniversary of Valerie's suicide, Leon alone stands trial on two counts of solicitation of capital murder.\n\nCameron Calligan [in court]: One of the things you'll learn about Leon Jacob is that he has to be in control. \u2026Mack was going to die, and Meghan was going to die.\n\nCameron Calligan is Samantha Knecht's co-prosecutor. He says Leon's motive was clear.\n\nCameron Calligan [in court]: There were two obstacles to the defendant's new life with Valerie McDaniel. It was Mack and it was Meghan. Mack could keep Valerie away from him by making Valerie choose between the defendant and her daughter, and Meghan could make him end up in prison.\n\nGeorge Parnham's co-counsel, Matthew Pospisil, claims that it was the undercover officer, whose identity \"48 Hours\" is protecting by calling Detective Javier, who pushed Valerie and Leon to make a deadly choice.\n\nMatthew Pospisil [in court]: If it was not for Officer ***** trying to make this into a television story and force his own narrative, Leon would not be forced here today to tell his story.\n\nTestimony begins with some of the early stops on this long road to justice, starting with Meghan Verikas.\n\nMichael Kubosh: He didn't want her to testify against him and he had paid somebody a lot of money to make sure that she wouldn't be here to testify against him.\n\nMoataz Azzeh: He wanted to make her disappear. \u2026he wanted her gone, like dead.\n\nBefore the trial concludes, two potential victims will rise from the dead to take the stand and the jury will hear from Leon who says he's only guilty of being a Casanova.\n\nLeon Jacob: I have no problem sitting here and saying that I slept with Valerie seven days after Meghan and I broke up, but I am not on trial for being a womanizer. I am on trial for solicitation of capital murder. So you can assassinate my character all you want up here, it doesn't make me guilty of what you are charging.\n\nON TRIAL\n\nOne of the prosecution's strongest witnesses, Meghan Verikas -- Leon's ex-girlfriend who had filed assault charges against him in January 2017 -- takes the stand\n\nMeghan Verikas: It was a long time coming. I tried to leave several times.\n\nShe recalls Leon coming to the house where she was staying just after the alleged incident.\n\nMeghan Verikas: I obviously didn't wanna be near him. So I hid in a closet.\n\nSamantha Knecht: Why did you hide in a closet?\n\nMeghan Verikas: Because I was afraid of Leon. \u2026He came in and was screaming and yelling \u2026 And he said, \"I know that you're -- I know that that bitch is here.\"\n\nMeghan says Leon kept pursuing her when she was at work:\n\nMeghan Verikas: He was in the bushes outside-- on a cell phone-- waiting for me.\n\nAnd when she drove to her new home.\n\nMeghan Verikas: At that point I called 911 to let them know that, you know, my ex-boyfriend who assaulted me was -- in a car behind me. \u2026At some point -- Leon had gotten out of his vehicle in front of mine just yelling and waving his hands sayin', \"You know, just talk to me. Just talk to me. I need to talk to you.\"\n\nLeon was arrested a second time, on stalking charges, on Feb. 16, 2017. Less than 10 days after that, Meghan Verikas was contacted by police and warned her life could be in danger. She fled to her hometown of Pittsburgh, but police soon called her to return to Houston to be part of that sting operation.\n\nMeghan Verikas: I sat in a chair in a warehouse.\n\nMeghan Verikas: They zip tied my hands and my feet -- and put duct tape around my mouth to -- make me look as if I had been kidnapped. \u2026I was crying and really upset.\n\nNext, it was Valerie's ex-husband Mack McDaniel's turn. He recalled finding out his ex-wife was living with Leon.\n\nSamantha Knecht: What was your initial reaction to that?\n\nMack McDaniel: My initial reaction was not good.\n\nSamantha Knecht: Why was that?\n\nMack McDaniel: Because I was aware of his history, his criminal history.\n\nSamantha Knecht: Did you convey to Valerie that you did not want the defendant around your daughter on the weeks that she had custody of *******?\n\nMack McDaniel: Yes, ma'am.\n\nSamantha Knecht: Did she agree to that?\n\nMack McDaniel: She did.\n\nSamantha Knecht: At some point, did you learn that she was not abiding by the agreement?\n\nMack McDaniel: I did.\n\nMack McDaniel tells the jury he, too, was notified he was the target of a murder plot. Then the prosecution shows the jury that photo:\n\nSamantha Knecht: Can you describe for the members of the jury what you're doing here?\n\nMack McDaniel: Staging my own death.\n\nSamantha Knecht: Did they pour blood on you?\n\nMack McDaniel: Pig's blood.\n\nThree days into the five-day trial, it's the defense's turn. They call their star witness:\n\nLeon Jacob: I never asked anybody to kill anybody.\n\nGeorge Parnham: Does the word kill, hurt, harm in any way, shape, or form appear in any of those recorded conversations?\n\nLeon Jacob: Not on my behalf. \u2026Except for to exclude them from things I want done. I never asked to have anybody hurt, killed, harmed, kidnapped. I never asked for anybody to be in any way physically hurt.\n\nUndercover cop: She's dead. She's gone.\n\nLeon Jacob: I don't want to know anything.\n\nBut the prosecution says that's not true. And they claim those undercover tapes back that up.\n\nSamantha Knecht: Did you not want anybody hurt when you said inject her with potassium chloride, stop her heart, untraceable?\n\nLeon Jacob: I said that was something you could do. I didn't say that for him to do that.\n\nSamantha Knecht: Did you recall telling the undercover office, \"if those options don't work, I don't give a f---.Then you got to do what you got to do because my survival is more important?\"\n\nLeon Jacob: Yes.\n\nLeon's own words come back to haunt him regarding Mack as well. After the undercover officer proposed a fatal carjacking, [Undercover cop: It could be a robbery gone wrong.] Leon offered $10,000 in four weekly installments.\n\nPool\n\nSamantha Knecht: OK, so you agreeing you gave him $2,500 just after he tells you, I am going to put a bullet in his head and throw him on the street.\n\nLeon Jacob: If that's what you say.\n\nSamantha: Well that's in the recording. It's not what I say. It's what Javier and you said, right?\n\nLeon Jacob: I guess.\n\nLeon and the defense team try to make their point that the undercover officer was pressuring them into making deadly decisions.\n\nLeon Jacob: I kept on telling him I didn't want anybody hurt and they kept on going back to the theme of killing people \u2026 I felt a lot of pressure from them to sort of commit to this idea of killing people and that was never my intent.\n\nMatthew Pospisil: Were you asking them to threaten people?\n\nLeon Jacob: Essentially, yes.\n\nMatthew Pospisil: Did you actually want any harm to come to anybody?\n\nLeon Jacob: No.\n\nBut the prosecution points out that when Leon thought Meghan was tied up and refusing to cooperate, he did nothing to stop the lethal final step.\n\nSamantha Knecht: You would agree with me that you never said no-no I don't want you to do anything, stop this. You didn't say anything like that did you?\n\nLeon Jacob: No.\n\nThe jury gets the case and takes just an hour and 15 minutes before returning to the courtroom.\n\nJudge: Has the jury reached unanimous verdicts on both cases?\n\nJury foreperson: Yes, Your honor. \u2026We the jury find the defendant Leon Jacob guilty of solicitation of capital murder as charged in the indictment.\n\nLeon Jacob is found guilty on both counts of conspiring to have Meghan and Mack killed. The trial moves to the sentencing phase. The same jury that found Leon guilty will decide his punishment.\n\nNew testimony begins.\n\nMeghan Verikas: I have no sense of trust, just constantly afraid that something else is going to happen.\n\nThe only thing that might impact Leon's sentence more than the words of his ex-girlfriend may end up being the words of his ex-wife.\n\nAnnie Morrison has flown in from Chicago to testify.\n\nAnnie Morrison: There was a time that we got into a fight and he pulled a knife on me.\n\nAnnie Morrison: There was one time he pushed my head down onto the counter and bruised my face near my eye.\n\nMorrison recounts an incident she says occurred when she was seven months pregnant with their second child:\n\nAnnie Morrison: He threatened to punch me in the stomach. He kicked my legs. I remember \u2026 I remember bringing my legs up as far as I could towards my chest to try to protect my stomach.\n\nAnnie Morrison: He threatened that if I ever left that he would kill me. He said that nobody would ever find my body because he was a doctor and he had access to chemicals that would dissolve my body.\n\nMorrison did leave, moving to her parents' home in Chicago. That's when Leon started threatening her parents -- as the jury heard in a recording Annie made of a phone call with Leon:\n\nLeon Jacob phonecall: I will torture them in front of you. Do you understand me, you f*****g bitch.\n\nThe jury took just one hour to decide Leon Jacob's sentence: life in prison on each count -- solicitation of capital murder for Meghan Verikas and Mack McDaniel.\n\nPool\n\nIn Texas, the victim impact statements come after the sentence. Meghan takes the stand one last time.\n\nMeghan Verikas: You will never see your children grow up. You will not be a part of their lives and they will be better for it. \u2026You destroyed me financially and took away my sense of security but you can do that no more.\n\nMeghan Verikas: While you sit in jail I hope you think of me, the girl that you called poor and uneducated. Because it's because of me you will be in prison for life.\n\nLeon Jacob will be eligible for parole in the year 2047. He will be 69 years old."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS/AP", "title": "California throws lifeline to PG&E for wildfires", "description": "State regulator signals willingness to backstop embattled utility linked to deadly wildfires", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pg-e-fires-in-california-camp-wildfire-utility/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/16/782f99ef-0180-4076-b98e-f6b67ec6e98b/thumbnail/1200x630/1719bc179f5efb99d6c0a71353c59ab4/2018-11-14t232242z-447963942-rc1e42db7b80-rtrmadp-3-california-wildfires.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T21:34:23Z", "content": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. - Shares of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric soared Friday after California's top utility regulator said his agency will help the company deal with potentially crippling liability costs from wildfires. Stock prices soared nearly 38 percent after \u2026 [+4198 chars]", "fulltext": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. - Shares of Pacific Gas & Electric soared Friday after California's top utility regulator said his agency will help the company deal with potentially crippling liability costs from wildfires.\n\nStock prices soared nearly 38 percent after plunging 60 percent and losing $15 billion in valuation in the week following the Northern California wildfire that is the nation's deadliest in a century.\n\nNo cause has been determined, but speculation has centered on PG&E, which reported an outage around the time and place the fire ignited. The death toll from the so-called Camp Fire has risen to at least 63, with hundreds of people still unaccounted for. California state investigators in June faulted PG&E-owned power lines for sparking a dozen blazes in Northern California in the fall of 2017 that killed 46 and incinerated nearly 9,000 homes and other structures.\n\nLate Thursday, California Public Utilities Commission President Michael Picker sought to calm financial markets by indicating support for the continued viability of PG&E and other publicly traded utilities.\n\nIn an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Picker said his agency will soon implement a provision in a new state law that makes it easier for utilities to pass costs for past wildfires to their customers.

Bill Dodd, a Napa Democrat who wrote the most recent legislation. \"The facts aren't in about the cause of these fires, and it's too soon to speculate about future legislation.\"\n\nLynsey Paulo, a spokeswoman for PG&E, welcomed Picker's comments.\n\n\"Access to affordable capital is critical to carrying out safety measures and meeting California's bold clean energy goals,\" she said in a statement. \"Recently passed legislation recognized the importance of financially healthy utilities to California electric customers and implementing it quickly is important to achieve that goal.\"\n\nPG&E last month asked U.S. energy regulators for permission to raise its customers' monthly bills. The reason: to harden its system against wildfires and deliver a sizable increase in profits to shareholders.\n\nIn an October filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. laid out a variety of dangers confronting its transmission lines running through Northern California, saying its system faced a higher risk of wildfires than any other utility.\n\n\"The implications of PG&E's exposure to potential liabilities associated with wildfires are dramatically magnified,\" the filing said. \"Overcoming the negative financial impact of any significant damages that might ultimately be attributed to PG&E will require an ongoing commitment of capital from investors.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Steve Hartman", "title": "A soldier says a stranger\u2019s Christmas card got him through Vietnam.

The launch clears the way for resumption of crewed flights next month.\n\nWith its engines throttled up to full thrust, the Soyuz rocket, carrying a Progress cargo ship loaded with 2.8 tons of supplies and equipment, blasted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 1:14 p.m. EST (GMT-5; 12:14 a.m. Saturday local time), climbing directly into the plane of the space station's orbit.\n\nTwo minutes after liftoff, the four liquid-fueled strap-on boosters making up the rocket's first stage were jettisoned as planned and the flight continued under the power of of the Soyuz FG's central second stage. The third stage then took over, boosting the Progress MS-10/71P supply ship into its planned preliminary orbit about eight minutes and 45 seconds after liftoff.\n\nThe Oct. 11 abort was blamed on a malfunction in the system used to jettison one of the four first-stage boosters. The strap-on crashed into the rocket's central core stage, triggering a computer-orchestrated emergency abort for Soyuz MS-10/56S commander Alexey Ovchinin and NASA astronaut Nick Hague.\n\nBoth men landed safely about 250 miles from the Baikonur Cosmodrome launch site, but Russia's workhorse Soyuz rockets were grounded while engineers sorted out what went wrong.\n\nThe problem was quickly traced to a bent, or deformed, mechanism in the separation system. No details were provided, but engineers examined downstream rockets to make sure the separation systems were in good shape and properly installed. They then pressed ahead with three successful launches of non station-related payloads.\n\nThe Progress cargo ship launched Friday was perched atop the same model booster used for space station crew launches. The flight was viewed as a final demonstration proving the Soyuz FG booster is once again ready to safely carry cosmonauts and astronauts to low-Earth orbit.\n\nGiven the rocket's apparently flawless performance, the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, is expected to proceed with plans to launch the Soyuz MS-11/57S spacecraft on Dec. 3, carrying commander Oleg Kononenko, Canadian flight engineer David Saint-Jacques and NASA astronaut Anne McClain on a four-orbit flight to the space station.\n\nNASA\n\nIn a recent interview with CBS News, McClain said she had full confidence in the Russian booster that will propel her to orbit.\n\n\"The Soyuz rocket has an amazing track record,\" she said in a satellite interview from Moscow. \"A launch has not been aborted since 1983, and that was a pad abort where the whole rocket kind of erupted in flames. And the crew successfully landed and went off to fly again.\n\n\"Going to space is not easy. The crew in October was lucky. But so is every crew that has flown in space over the last 50 years, 60 years. I'm very familiar with the rocket and with the redundancy of their systems and with their safety systems. And I'll be frank with you, I would have gotten on a rocket the day after that (abort) happened.\"\n\nMcClain and her crewmates will be welcomed aboard the station by Expedition 57 commander Alexander Gerst, Soyuz MS-09/55S commander Sergey Prokopyev and NASA physician-astronaut Serena Au\u00f1\u00f3n-Chancellor. They were launched to the station June 6 and have had the lab to themselves since the departure of three other crew members Oct. 4.\n\nThe Progress launching Friday was the first of two back-to-back space station resupply missions.\n\nOn Saturday, Northrop Grumman plans to launch an Antares rocket from Wallops Island, Virginia, carrying a Cygnus cargo ship loaded with 7,385 pounds of equipment and supplies. Liftoff from pad 0A is targeted for 4:01 a.m.\n\nThe Progress MS-10/71P vehicle is scheduled to arrive at the station Sunday around 2:30 p.m., autonomously docking to the aft port of the Russian Zvezda module. The Progress is loaded with 1,653 pounds of propellant for space station orbital adjustments, 165 pounds of pure oxygen and air, 970 pounds of water and 2,866 pounds of spare parts and equipment.\n\nIf all goes well, the Cygnus supply ship will arrive Monday around 5:20 a.m., pulling up to within 30 feet and then standing by while Au\u00f1\u00f3n-Chancellor, operating the lab's robot arm, locks onto a grapple fixture.\n\nFrom there, flight controllers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston will pull the Cygnus in for berthing at the Earth-facing port of the central Unity module. Among the supplies for the crew are fresh fruit and ice cream, treats that will go well with Thanksgiving fare already on board.\n\nA third resupply mission, this one using a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon cargo craft, is scheduled for launch Dec. 4, the day after Kononenko and his crew arrive on board station.\n\nGerst, Prokopyev and Au\u00f1\u00f3n-Chancellor are scheduled to return to Earth on Dec. 20, wrapping up a 196-day mission. Expedition 58 commander Kononenko, Saint-Jacques and McClain will have the station to themselves until April when another Soyuz carries another set of crew members to the lab."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "This week on \"Sunday Morning\" (November 18)", "description": "A look at the features for this week's broadcast of the #1 Sunday morning news program", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/this-week-on-sunday-morning-november-18/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/16/59e954e2-e773-426a-9d5c-3cd9447d9367/thumbnail/1200x630/74216da282375de1d9fc3058e8a5029b/key-lime-pie-promo.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T19:49:26Z", "content": "Jane Pauley hosts our annual holiday broadcast devoted to all things epicurean.

Amy Klobuchar, Mark Warner, Chris Coons and Richard Blumenthal sent a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg requesting that he respond to the report and reminding him that Facebook's own internal probes showed that it had left its users' data vulnerable and had failed to put in place protocols that would prevent its platform from being manipulated by foreign adversaries trying to meddle in the American political system.\n\n\"Both elected officials and the general public have rightfully questioned whether Facebook is capable of regulating its own conduct,\" they chided before going on to say that the \"staggering amount of data\" Facebook has collected on both its users and non-users raises concerns that it could improperly use its vast resources against the government or critics who are trying to protect the public.\n\nAccording to the Times, Facebook employed a Republican research firm to discredit activists protesting the company, including billionaire philanthropist George Soros -- a frequent target of conservative anti-Semitic conspiracy theories -- and Diamond and Silk, the pro-Trump social media stars and sisters who accused Facebook of censoring them.\n\nIn her first interview since the story was published, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg told \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Norah O'Donnell she did not know about an effort described by the Times to publish stories critical of other tech companies, an apparent attempt to deflect attention away from Facebook. The campaign was reportedly orchestrated by the consulting firm Definers Public Affairs, a Republican opposition research group hired by Facebook.\n\n\"We absolutely did not pay anyone to create fake news - that they have assured me was not happening. And again, we're doing a thorough look into what happened but they have assured me that we were not paying anyone to either write or promote anything that was false. And that's very important,\" Sandberg said.\n\nFacebook has been plagued with a series of public relations disasters in recent years, such as the revelation that millions of users' data had been hacked, that it was one of the social media sites used by Russian actors to interfere in the 2016 election, and that it may have allowed the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to sweep up data from as many as 87 million users. Klobuchar and Warner have proposed a bill which would ensure that political ads sold online are covered by the same rules as ads sold on TV, radio, and print.\n\nIn the letter, the senators ask Zuckerberg several questions relating to the Times' report, including whether Facebook has retaliated against critics or obfuscated on its positions, and whether it ever sought to conceal information related to foreign meddling in the 2016 U.S. election from government investigators from the public.\n\nThe senators also said that some of them have requested that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein expand the scope of the government's investigations to include the media reporting that Facebook hired contractors to retaliate against its critics."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "AP", "title": "Judge allows class-action lawsuit by mentally ill veterans", "description": "The veterans say they were unfairly given less-than-honorable discharges for minor infractions linked to their untreated mental health problems", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-allows-class-action-suit-by-mentally-ill-veterans-denied-va-health-benefits/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/05/07/ba600aa8-7614-4782-9436-045f77487a2f/thumbnail/1200x630/141f655968d7c17958fd465d6d4d56f5/istock-640317962.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T19:41:52Z", "content": "HARTFORD, Conn. \u2014 Thousands of Navy and Marine Corps veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan who developed post-traumatic stress disorder but were denied Veterans Affairs health benefits have been given a green light to sue the military, under a ruling by a federal \u2026 [+2944 chars]", "fulltext": "HARTFORD, Conn. \u2014 Thousands of Navy and Marine Corps veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan who developed post-traumatic stress disorder but were denied Veterans Affairs health benefits have been given a green light to sue the military, under a ruling by a federal judge in Connecticut.\n\nSenior U.S. District Judge Charles Haight Jr. in New Haven on Thursday certified a class-action lawsuit against Navy Secretary Richard Spencer by veterans who say they were unfairly given less-than-honorable discharges for minor infractions linked to their untreated mental health problems.\n\nThe discharge designation prevents them from getting VA benefits including mental health treatment.\n\n\"This decision is a victory for the tens of thousands of military veterans suffering from service-connected PTSD and TBI (traumatic brain injury),\" lead plaintiff and Marine veteran Tyson Manker, of Jacksonville, Illinois, said in a statement Friday. \"The fact that the Court has now recognized this class of veterans is further evidence of the Department of Defense's disgraceful violation of the legal rights of the men and women who have served their country.\"\n\nManker developed PTSD after serving in the 2003 invasion of Iraq and received an other-than-honorable discharge for a single incident of self-medicating himself with an illegal drug, according to the lawsuit. The Naval Discharge Review Board rejected his request for a discharge upgrade, as it has done with similar applications by thousands of other veterans.\n\nNavy officials did not immediately return messages seeking comment Friday. The Connecticut U.S. Attorney's Office, which is defending the Navy against the lawsuit, declined to comment.\n\nIn a court filing, a federal prosecutor listed several reasons why a class-action lawsuit should be rejected, including that the plaintiffs could reapply for discharge upgrades under new rules put in place last year that call for more leniency for veterans with mental health problems.\n\nYale Law School students are representing the veterans and have filed a similar lawsuit against the Army. They say nearly a third of the more than 2 million Americans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan suffer from PTSD and related mental health conditions and the military is issuing less-than-honorable discharges at historically high rates, often for minor infractions attributable to undiagnosed mental illness.\n\nLast year, the discharge review boards for the Army and Air Force granted about 51 percent of discharge upgrade applications involving PTSD, while the Navy board granted only 16 percent. Haight called the discrepancy \"stark.\"\n\nAnother plaintiff in the Navy lawsuit, which was filed in March, is the Connecticut-based National Veterans Council for Legal Redress, a group of veterans with less-than-honorable discharges.\n\n\"We filed this lawsuit to make sure that the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans with service-connected PTSD do not suffer the same injustices as the Vietnam generation,\" said Garry Monk, executive director of the veterans group. \"We are thrilled with the court's decision and look forward to creating a world where it doesn't take years of wading through unlawful procedures for these veterans to get relief.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS/AP", "title": "Migrants at America's doorstep in Tijuana face long stay", "description": "U.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at the main border crossing with San Diego", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/central-american-migrants-streaming-into-tijuana-face-long-stay-2018-11-16/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/16/e12b91cb-fadf-4042-aaed-17ec1db6e31d/thumbnail/1200x630/db90da61ac540956831fd3e78785f547/ap-18319674000493.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T19:33:21Z", "content": "TIJUANA, Mexico -- About 2,000 migrants from the Central American caravan are at America's doorstep and another 1,200 from a second caravan set out from Mexico City toward the border Friday.

With U.S. border inspectors processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at the main border crossing with San Diego, prospects grew that migrants would be stuck waiting in Tijuana for months.\n\nThe first group split from a larger group of about 5,000 planning to request asylum in the U.S. The caravan has fragmented somewhat in recent days in a final push to the border, with some migrants moving rapidly in buses and others falling behind.\n\nWith shelters already full, authorities in Tijuana opened a gymnasium and gated sport complex for up to 1,000 migrants, with a potential to expand to 3,000. But at least that many migrants were still on the road or trickling into the city aboard buses, and a third caravan was still waiting in Mexico City.\n\nTijuana faces a potential influx of as many as 10,000 in all. The city's privately run shelters are meant to have a capacity of 700.\n\nFrancisco Rueda, the top deputy to Baja California state Gov. Francisco Vega de la Madrid, said, \"This is not a crisis,\" but agreed that \"this is an extraordinary situation.\"\n\nGregory Bull/AP\n\nTo claim asylum in San Diego, migrants enter their names in a tattered notebook held together by duct tape and managed by the migrants in a plaza outside the entry to the main border crossing. On Thursday, migrants who registered six weeks ago were getting their names called. The waiting list has grown to more than 3,000 names and stands to become much longer with the new arrivals.\n\nRueda said that if all migrants from the caravan currently in Tijuana were to register to seek asylum in the U.S., they would likely have to wait four months at current processing rates. For that reason, the state has asked Mexican federal authorities to encourage people in other caravans to go to other border cities.\n\nConcerns continued about what the Central Americans will do, or how they will support themselves in the meantime.\n\nRueda said the state has 7,000 jobs available for its \"Central American migrant brothers\" who obtain legal residence status in Mexico.\n\n\"Today in Baja California there is an employment opportunity for those who request it, but in order for this to happen, it has to regulate migrant status,\" he said.\n\nThe thriving factories in the city of 1.6 million are always looking for workers, and several thousand Haitian migrants who were turned away at the U.S. border have found jobs and settled in Tijuana the last two years.\n\nMigrant caravans heading to the U.S. became a campaign issue in U.S. midterm elections. President Trump ordered the deployment of over 5,000 military troops to the border and has insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\n\nMany say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Trump has written answers to special counsel's questions; weighs in on Acosta ruling", "description": "President Trump told reporters Friday that he has written answers to questions from the special counsel regarding the Russia investigation, though he has not yet submitted them.

Opponents argue the annual recreations of Black Pete promote racist stereotypes. Supporters defend the sidekick of Sinterklaas, the white-bearded, red-robed Dutch version of St. Nicholas, as a traditional children's character.\n\nA nationally televised arrival parade takes place Saturday in the picturesque village of Zaandijk, north of Amsterdam. Sinterklaas and his helpers are set to arrive on a boat and then tour the village. One group unsuccessfully tried in court to keep Pete from the party.\n\nGeralt Lammers, a spokesman for Zaandam municipality, which includes Zaandijk, said four groups, two in favor and two against Black Pete, have said they plan demonstrations. The municipality has assigned specific areas for the protests to avoid possible confrontations between the pro- and anti-Pete camps.\n\nThe most prominent group, Kick Out Black Pete, said on its Facebook page that it is organizing weekend demonstrations in 18 Dutch municipalities, but not in Zaandijk. The far-right Netherlands People's Union is one of the groups planning to demonstrate in support of the Christmas character.\n\nPeter Dejong/AP\n\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte entered the debate Friday, calling on all protesters not to spoil the festivities for children.\n\n\"I think society agrees on one thing: we grant children the magic of the Sinterklaas party,\" Rutte said at his weekly press conference.\n\nNTR, the public broadcaster responsible for the televised event, said the Black Petes in this year's parade will have faces made up in various shades. In recent years, the color of the character's face has been attributed to smudges of soot from going up and down chimneys to deliver gifts.\n\n\"The more often a Pete has been through a chimney, the more soot he or she has on their face,\" NTR said in a statement earlier this year.\n\nAnti-Pete protesters took their arguments to court this week, arguing the character was racist and discriminatory. Afro-style wigs are part of some costumes as well as blackface makeup, though fewer than in past years. But a judge refused the request to keep Black Pete out of the parade.\n\n\"Black Pete is undoubtedly changing,\" judge Antoon Schotman said. \"Some think that the process is moving too slowly and that's fine. Others believe the process is moving too quickly. There is no objective way of measuring it.

The regime's reign of terror was responsible for the deaths of an estimated 1.7 million people.\n\nNuon Chea and Khieu Samphan were top leaders in the regime, which forced residents out of the cities into the countryside where they labored under brutal conditions in giant agricultural cooperatives and work projects. The communist Khmer Rouge, under the leadership of the late Pol Pot, sought to eliminate all traces of what they saw as corrupt bourgeois life, destroying most religious, financial and social institutions.\n\nNuon Chea and Khieu Samphan were sentenced by the U.N.-assisted court to life in prison -- the same punishment they are already serving after being convicted in a previous trial for crimes against humanity connected with forced transfers of people and mass disappearances. Cambodia has no death penalty.\n\nNuon Chea, 92, was considered the Khmer Rouge's main ideologist and Pol Pot's right-hand man, while Khieu Samphan, 87, served as the head of state, presenting a moderate veneer as the public face for the highly secretive group.\n\nMark Peters/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDissent under Khmer Rouge rule was usually met with death, and even the group's loyalists faced torture and execution as the radical experiment at revolution failed, with blame cast about its ranks for alleged sabotage.\n\nBut executions counted for only a fraction of the death toll. Starvation, overwork and medical neglect took many more lives, amounting to as much as one-quarter to one-third of the entire population. Only when an invasion by Vietnam finally drove the Khmer Rouge from power in 1979 did the magnitude of Cambodia's holocaust become known.\n\nFriday's verdict, read aloud by Judge Nil Nonn, established that the Khmer Rouge committed genocide against the Vietnamese and Cham minorities. Scholars had debated whether suppression of the Chams, a Muslim ethnic minority whose members had put up a small but futile resistance against the Khmer Rouge, amounted to genocide.\n\nThe crimes against humanity convictions covered activities at work camps and cooperatives established by the Khmer Rouge. They included murder, extermination, deportation, enslavement, imprisonment, torture, persecution on political, religious and racial grounds, attacks on human dignity, enforced disappearances, forced transfers, forced marriages and rape.\n\nThe breaches of the Geneva Convention governing war crimes included willful killing, torture or inhumane treatment.\n\nThe tribunal, officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, or ECCC, also ordered reparations for some of those judged to be victims.\n\nMark Peters/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt found Khieu Samphan not guilty of genocide against the Cham for insufficient evidence, though he was convicted of genocide against the Vietnamese under the principle of joint criminal enterprise, which holds individuals responsible for actions attributed to a group to which they belong.\n\nLawyers for Nuon Chea said they would appeal, and Khieu Samphan was expected to do the same. Both men have suggested they were targets of political persecution.\n\nBBC News reports that a common frustration for victims is that lower-level Khmer Rouge members have never faced justice for their alleged crimes. Perpetrators and victims often live alongside each other.\n\nSoy Sen, who says he was imprisoned and tortured, said of Friday's verdict: \"It's not going to heal the deep wounds they inflicted upon us.\"\n\nThere are also fears that politics will thwart the tribunal from undertaking any further prosecutions. Cambodia's long-serving, autocratic Prime Minister Hun Sen has declared he will allow no further cases to go forward, saying they would cause instability. Hun Sen was a Khmer Rouge commander who defected when the group was in power and was installed in government after the Khmer Rouge were ousted by Vietnam's invasion.\n\nInitial work had been done on two more cases involving four middle-ranking members of the Khmer Rouge, but they have been scuttled or bottled up by the tribunal, which is a hybrid court in which Cambodian prosecutors and judges are paired with international counterparts.\n\nThe failure to attain a broader sweep of justice has troubled some observers.\n\n\"Today's verdict hopefully brings some measure of justice to the victims, 40 years after the unspeakable mass atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia,\" said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International's regional director for East and Southeast Asia. \"While this second trial of the Khmer Rouge's last surviving senior leaders results in two convictions, and 14 reparation projects, this is bitter justice: the world has waited far too long for this moment. Decades after the crimes and 13 years after it was established, the ECCC should have achieved much more.\"\n\nOthers, however, highlighted the tribunal's accomplishments.\n\n\"International tribunals are better than the alternative, impunity. They will always be political and fall short of expectations,\" Alexander Hinton, an anthropology professor at Rutgers University and author of two books about the tribunal, said ahead of Friday's verdicts. \"But justice is usually delivered, even if at times, as has been the case with the ECCC, it staggers across the finish line.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Artificial intelligence is transforming the world; is it also coming for your job?", "description": "Artificial intelligence is transforming the world.

The Oscar-winning screenwriter and Hollywood wise man was 87. Goldman won Academy Awards for \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" and \"All the President's Men,\" and summed up the mystery of making a box office hit by declaring, \"Nobody knows anything.\"\n\nGoldman's daughter Jenny said her father died early Friday in New York due to complications from colon cancer and pneumonia. \"So much of what's he's written can express who he was and what he was about,\" she said, adding that the last few weeks, while Goldman was ailing, revealed just how many people considered him family.\n\nGoldman, who also converted his novels \"Marathon Man,\" \"Magic\" and \"Heat\" into screenplays, clearly knew more than most about what the audience wanted. He was not only a successful film writer but a top script doctor, the industry title for an uncredited writer brought in to improve or \"punch up\" weak screenplays.\n\nAP\n\nGoldman also made political history by coining the phrase \"follow the money\" in his script for \"All the President's Men,\" adapted from the book by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein on the Watergate political scandal. The film starred Robert Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein. Standing in the shadows, Hal Holbrook was the mystery man code-named Deep Throat who helped the reporters pursue the evidence. His advice, \"Follow the money,\" became so widely quoted that few people realized it was never said during the actual scandal.\n\nA confirmed New Yorker, Goldman declined to work in Hollywood. Instead, he would fly to Los Angeles for two-day conferences with directors and producers, then return home to fashion a script, which he did with amazing speed. In his bestselling 1985 book, \"Adventures in the Screen Trade,\" he expressed disdain for an industry that elaborately produced and tested a movie, only to see it dismissed by the public during its first weekend in theaters.\n\n\"Nobody knows anything,\" he remarked.\n\nScreenwriter and filmmaker Aaron Sorkin called Goldman a mentor.\n\n\"He was the dean of American screenwriters and generations of filmmakers will continue to walk in the footprints he laid,\" Sorkin said in a statement. \"He wrote so many unforgettable movies, so many thunderous novels and works of non-fiction, and while I'll always wish he'd written one more, I'll always be grateful for what he's left us.\"\n\nGoldman launched his writing career after receiving a master's degree in English from Columbia University in 1956. Weary of academia, he declined the chance to earn a Ph.D., choosing instead to write the novel \"The Temple of Gold\" in 10 days. Knopf agreed to publish it.\n\n\"If the book had not been taken,\" he told an interviewer, \"I would have gone into advertising ... or something.\"\n\nInstead, he wrote other novels, including \"Soldier in the Rain,\" which became a movie starring Steve McQueen. Goldman also co-authored a play and a musical with his older brother, James, but both failed on Broadway.\n\nJames Goldman would later write the historical play \"The Lion in Winter,\" which he converted to film, winning the 1968 Oscar for best adapted screenplay.\n\nWilliam Goldman had come to screenwriting by accident after actor Cliff Robertson read one of his books, \"No Way to Treat a Lady,\" and thought it was a film treatment. After he hired the young writer to fashion a script from a short story, Goldman rushed out to buy a book on screen writing. Robertson rejected the script but found Goldman a job working on a screenplay for a British thriller. After that he adapted his novel \"Harper\" for a 1966 film starring Paul Newman as a private eye.\n\nHe broke through in 1969 with the blockbuster \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" starring Newman and Redford. The script for \"Butch Cassidy\" earned Goldman the highest selling price for a movie script up to that point, $400,000, and an Oscar for best original screenplay. Based on the exploits of the real-life \"Hole in the Wall\" gang of bank robbers, the movie began a long association with Redford, who also appeared in \"The Hot Rock,\" \u2033The Great Waldo Pepper\" and \"Indecent Proposal.\"\n\nOther notable Goldman films included \"The Stepford Wives,\" \"A Bridge Too Far\" and \"Misery.\" The latter, adapted from a Stephen King suspense novel, won the 1990 Oscar for Kathy Bates as lead actress.\n\nIn 1961 Goldman married Ilene Jones, a photographer, and they had two daughters, Jenny and Susanna. The couple divorced in 1991.\n\nBorn in Chicago on Aug. 12, 1931, Goldman grew up in the suburb of Highland Park. He graduated from Oberlin College in 1952 and served two years in the Army.\n\nDespite all his success as a screenwriter, Goldman always considered himself a novelist and didn't rate his scripts as great artistic achievements.\n\n\"A screenplay is a piece of carpentry,\" he once said. \"And except in the case of Ingmar Bergman, it's not an art, it's a craft.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "What to stream this weekend: \"Narcos,\" \"Escape at Dannemora,\" and \"My Brilliant Friend\"", "description": "TV Guide editor Krutika Mollikarjuna joins CBSN to talk about three of the best new titles available for streaming.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/what-to-stream-this-weekend-narcos-escape-at-dannemora-and-my-brilliant-friend/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/16/54f6ff9c-69ff-4b5f-8fba-a3d989011ae0/thumbnail/1200x630/aeb2509cacb6d6ef0df5d547e85d2ec1/1116-cbsn-zwj-whattostream-1713875-640x360.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:03:27Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Grace Segers", "title": "Chuck Grassley to leave Judiciary Committee", "description": "Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley is leaving to become chair of the Finance Committee", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chuck-grassley-to-leave-judiciary-committee-paving-the-way-for-lindsey-graham-to-become-chair/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/16/6735f632-6b23-418e-b75c-01b012aed218/thumbnail/1200x630/4121976ade4830fee033f8c17c010361/gettyimages-633172992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:02:54Z", "content": "Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley is moving to become the chair of the Finance Committee, paving the way for Sen.

Illinois state police said the officer, who is on paid leave and remains unidentified, yelled at the 26-year-old Roberson to drop his gun before opening fire, but their account differs from those of witnesses.\n\nThe Rev. Michael Pfleger, an outspoken anti-violence advocate, said on Twitter that the officer should \"face the same consequences as Jason Van Dyke,\" a white officer who was charged with murder and convicted last month in the 2014 killing of black teen Laquan McDonald.\n\nA coalition of religious leaders including Pfleger, the Rev. Walter Turner and the Rev. Marshall Hatch gathered Friday outside the Midlothian Police Department to call on Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan to investigate.\n\n\"We're not going to tolerate a cover-up. We're not going to tolerate this being swept under the rug. We're calling for a full investigation,\" said Hatch.\n\nVia CBS Chicago\n\nAnother security guard said Wednesday that he never heard the officer order the other man to drop his gun. Dorian Myrickes, who was shot in the shoulder in the initial gunfight, told The Associated Press in a phone interview from his hospital room that he clearly heard several people shout at the officer that Roberson - who was holding a suspect at gunpoint -- was a security guard.\n\nIt was not the only aspect where Myrickes' account differed from that of the news release that Illinois State Police issued Tuesday night that for the first time addressed in detail what happened in the predominantly black community of Robbins just south of Chicago. The agency declined to comment beyond the release, which came as questions have swirled about whether the shooting was justified and whether race played a role.\n\nIn its release, state police said Roberson was wearing \"plain black clothing with no markings readily identifying him as a Security Guard.\" However, Myrickes said all the security guards wore knit hats emblazoned with the word \"Security\" on them and that Roberson wore a black sweat shirt with the word \"Security\" on the back of his shoulder. But he also acknowledged that it's possible the officer could not see the white lettering from where he was standing.\n\n\"Jemel Roberson is dead for no other reason than doing his job, protecting people,\" Pfleger said. \"Let's not ignore the elephant in the room. The problem with Jemel is he was black, and this mystery officer needs to be fired. As a white person, I say to white society, it's time to stop fearing the black man, and treat him like you treat your own brothers and sisters.\"\n\nThe religious leaders hailed Roberson as a \"national hero.\"\n\nMidlothian police chief Daniel Delaney, whose officer opened fire, has also hailed Roberson for his bravery, reports the Chicago Tribune.\n\nCBS Chicago\n\nDelaney said in the statement: \"Jemel Roberson was a brave man who was doing his best to end an active shooter situation at Manny's Blue Room.\"\n\n\"The Midlothian Police Department is completely saddened by this tragic incident and we give our heartfelt condolences to Jemel, his family and his friends. There are no words that can be expressed as to the sorrow his family is dealing with,\" the statement says.\n\nBut Pfleger rejected Delaney's characterization of the shooting as \"the equivalent of a 'blue on blue' friendly fire incident.\"\n\n\"It was murder. It was not 'blue on blue' crime, it was blue on black crime,\" Pfleger said. \"It was not an accidental shooting. Rather, there was an officer who pulled up to the scene, pulled out his gun, and fired. Jemel was on top of the offender, protecting other people.\"\n\nMyrickes was one of six security guards working at the bar at the time, but he is the only one so far to come forward publicly to discuss what happened. A bar patron also told reporters earlier that he heard people yelling at the officer that Roberson was a security guard.\n\nMyrickes, 43, said the initial shooting at the bar stemmed from a fight between two groups of people. As security guards tried to separate them and lead them out separate doors, \"Somebody came back and opened fire,\" Myrickes said.\n\nHe said he wasn't armed and that he doesn't believe other security guards fired their weapons.\n\nThe officer who shot Roberson was among several officers from various agencies who responded to the shooting. Myrickes told the AP that the Midlothian officer ran into the bar and pointed his gun at a bar customer, the bartender and Myrickes. Myrickes said he informed the officer that he was a security guard, and the officer then went outside.\n\nLooking out the door, Myrickes said he \"could see Jemel had one guy face down, asking him to put his hands behind his back\" when he saw the officer point his weapon at Roberson.\n\n\"I never heard the cop demand him to do anything, (but) everybody was telling him (Jemel) was security.\"\n\nMyrickes also noted that none of the other responding officers opened fire.\n\nWe\u2019ve been formally retained to rep. the heirs of #JemelRoberson.

If any police bodycam video exists, no state law requires that it be released. The Chicago Police Department releases video within 90 days of a shooting, but that policy does not apply because that agency's officers were not involved.\n\nThe Illinois State Police wouldn't respond to a series of questions from CBS News, including regarding the contradictory accounts of Roberson's clothing, how much time elapsed between the time the officer shouted commands and opened fire, whether video exists of the shooting, whether the officer pointed his gun at another security guard, and how they respond to those who say race played a role.\n\nA spokesman said the investigation is ongoing and no further information outside of the statement would be released at this time.\n\nAttorney Gregory E. Kulis, who filed a lawsuit contending the shooting was unjustified and unprovoked, said the police release is woefully incomplete.\n\nKulis, who has also filed a motion asking a judge to order the agencies to preserve any footage they have, also said he doesn't yet know how many times Roberson was shot or where on his body he was shot.\n\nRoberson was an aspiring police officer who played the organ at his and other area churches.

On a dollar basis, the 2018 price is $450 more than in 2017. Through October, the U.S. government's Consumer Price Index has increased 2.5 percent.\n\nA slump in gold prices has tarnished the cost of the song's five gold rings, which fell 9 percent this year due to gold prices, PNC said. The eight maids a-milking and nine ladies dancing didn't get a raise this year -- blame the stagnant federal minimum wage, which hasn't budged from $7.25 an hour since 2009.\n\nStill, not all wages are stagnating. More skillful work from the presumably arts-trained lords a-leaping, pipers piping and drummers drumming rose between 3 percent to 3.5 percent, PNC said. The bank used ballet performances to estimate the pay for lords a-leaping, while the cost of nine ladies dancing is based on modern dance troops, which haven't seen a bump in pay.\n\n\"Consumer confidence remains strong and wage growth is beginning to catch up with high employment,\" Amanda Agati, co-chief investment strategist for PNC Financial Services Group, said in a statement. \"The PNC Christmas Price Index reflects these trends, as we see strong growth in key areas.\"\n\nOn a dollar basis, the biggest overall cost are the swans a-swimming, which PNC estimates at $13,125 for the seven animals. That's unchanged from 2017. Swans are expensive animals, with white mute swans fetching about $1,470 apiece at one poultry retailer.\n\nPNC said the biggest price spike this year was the cost of egg-laying geese, which has not seen an increase since 2014. \"Backyard animals are in vogue now, so higher demand drives up the price,\" a PNC spokesman noted.\n\nIf you buy the gifts online, the cost will be higher, at $41,166, or about $2,071.02 more than in-store purchases, PNC said. That's because online costs tend to be higher than store prices due to shipping and other costs, the bank said.\n\nSince a predecessor of PNC Bank began the index more than three decades ago, the cost of the song's goods have nearly doubled, rising 95 percent over the years, it added.\n\nBelow are the 12 goods and services in the song, with their latest estimated cost and change from a year earlier."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Jessica Kegu", "title": "How Willem Dafoe unlocked Vincent Van Gogh for \"At Eternity's Gate\"", "description": "\"It's about painting and it was important for me to paint in the movie,\" says Willem Dafoe, who portrays Van Gogh in the critically-acclaimed new film", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/willem-dafoe-on-portraying-vincent-van-gogh-in-new-film-at-eternitys-gate/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/16/20aa4207-74c0-4c50-bfa7-b31cd861efd9/thumbnail/1200x630/400eccded63f3ad3827f91a1017776a2/1116-ctm-eternitysgateqa-dafoe-1713728-640x360.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T16:51:46Z", "content": "Julian Schnabel's new film, \"At Eternity's Gate,\" explores one of the world's most storied artists: Vincent Van Gogh.

While Van Gogh has long been a subject of intense interest, having died at just 37 years old after suffering what is believed to be a series of psychotic episodes, this latest film starring Willem Dafoe seeks to make a point about life as an artist.\n\nFor Dafoe, painting was the key to getting inside the troubled artist's mind. The film focuses on the final few years of Van Gogh's life and features Dafoe painting in real time, a skill he had to learn for the role.\n\n\"It's about painting and it was important for me to paint in the movie, and that really became the key to unlocking a relationship to Van Gogh,\" Dafoe told \"CBS This Morning.\"\n\nWith more than 100 credits to his name, Dafoe is known for his versatility. This latest role has earned him praise of the highest degree from critics \u2013 some of whom have called it the best work of his career \u2013 and from director Julian Schnabel, a celebrated painter himself, who said he can't picture anyone but Dafoe portraying Van Gogh.\n\nDafoe said of Schnabel, \"He taught me many things about painting, how to make marks, how to paint light. It really changed how I see, and that was essential. And that's really the heart of the movie, because if you can kind of get into how to look at Van Gogh's work, you can get in his head and that's the experience of the movie.\"\n\nAsked by \"CBS This Morning\" co-host John Dickerson to describe what he sees at that moment, the Oscar-nominated actor effortlessly slipped into a description that seems only possible from someone with an artist's eye.\n\n\"Well, looking at you right now, initially I would have tried to paint a man there. But right now I'm looking at you, I see that white highlight here, I paint the light,\" he said. \"It's not just deconstruction, you start to see the origin of things, the rise and fall of things. And it really opens everything up and it's a new way of seeing. And really, for me, when you start to see that happen in the movie, and you do as you watch him paint.\"\n\nThough deeply troubled, Van Gogh's final years were his most productive, resulting in some of his best-known works produced at a pace of almost one per day.\n\n\"It appears from his -- from my view, it appears he was happiest when he was painting and he was very productive then. \u2026 I didn't think so much about the tortured aspect, I really concentrated on the painting. It was tortured in that it was hard to reconcile those ecstatic states with everyday life,\" Dafoe said. \"I think that he's deeply steeped in spiritual impulse -- that he was much more joyous than we often think.\"\n\n\"At Eternity's Gate,\" is distributed by CBS Films, a division of CBS."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "AP", "title": "Michelle Obama says \"Access Hollywood\" tape led her to speak out", "description": "Michelle Obama talks about her emotional New Hampshire speech in 2016 condemning President Donald Trump after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape was released", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/michelle-obama-says-access-hollywood-tape-led-her-to-speak-out/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/12/12/77e5d36d-5915-46ce-b496-218c87d98c5d/thumbnail/1200x630/15dcb72c6fdec4125306ed9638345480/cbsnews-1600x900.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T16:43:37Z", "content": "Michelle Obama said she felt anxious before giving her emotional New Hampshire speech in 2016 condemning Donald Trump for bragging about sexually assaulting women in a recording more than a decade ago.

The state health department on Friday confirmed that the \"severely ill child\" at the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation had the adenovirus infection. The youth died Thursday night in a hospital, but further details about the child were not disclosed.\n\nThe department says the child was among 34 pediatric cases that have been associated with the outbreak.\n\n\n\nOfficials say the affected children became ill between Sept. 26 and Nov. 12. All of them had severely compromised immune systems due to other medical conditions. An additional positive adenovirus case was confirmed late Thursday night. One staff member was also confirmed with the virus but has since recovered.\n\nNew Jersey Advance Media reporter Susan Livio has been investigating the outbreak and told CBS News that two staff members she spoke to expressed concern about conditions and management at the facility. The workers, who asked to remain anonymous, said the facility was understaffed to save money and that it delayed getting the sick children to a hospital.\n\n\"The workers claim that there was a policy of trying to keep the beds filled as long as possible. Because as soon as the children leave the facility, the facility loses its Medicaid funding, and that's $519 a day [per patient],\" Livio said.\n\nThe state health commissioner said moving the children to other care facilities wasn't a viable option, Livio explained.\n\n\"These are children who were born with birth defects, relied on technology to help them eat and breathe \u2014 very vulnerable children,\" she said. \"They needed to just contain the infection and make it work.\"\n\nState health inspectors reported finding lax hand-washing among staff that could have helped spread infections.\n\nWhat is adenovirus?\n\nAdenoviruses are a family of viruses that account for about 5 to 10 percent of fevers in young children. A person can become infected with adenovirus at any age and it causes a range of illnesses, from mild to severe.\n\nMost people who get sick from adenovirus recover after a few days, but people with weakened immune systems, or existing respiratory or cardiac disease, are at higher risk of developing severe complications from an infection. The children at the Wanaque Center are severely disabled, which explains how the outbreak became deadly.\n\nAccording to the New Jersey Department of Health, the particular strain of adenovirus (#7) involved in the outbreak has been associated with disease in communal living arrangements and can be more severe.\n\nAdenovirus can lead to a variety of symptoms, ranging from mild to life-threatening, including:\n\nCommon cold\n\nSore throat\n\nBronchitis\n\nPneumonia\n\nDiarrhea\n\nPink eye\n\nFever\n\nBladder inflammation or infection\n\nInflammation of stomach and intestines\n\nNeurologic disease\n\nThe virus is spread from one infected person to another through close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands; coughing or sneezing; or touching a contaminated object or surface and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes. Infection can also be spread through contact with an infected person's stool, including during diaper changing.\n\nCurrently there is no adenovirus vaccine available in the United States to the general public. A vaccine for adenovirus types 4 and 7 was approved in March 2011, but only for U.S. military personnel who may be at higher risk for infection from these viruses.\n\nSimple steps to protect yourself and your family from adenoviruses and other respiratory infections include:\n\nFrequent hand washing with soap and water\n\nAvoiding close contact with people who are sick"}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "El Chapo trial: The complicated history of the Mexican cartel", "description": "The trial for alleged Mexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman began this week in New York.

Mr. Trump has often praised Scalia and has made good on his promise to nominate judges \"very much in the mold of Justice Scalia\" in the Supreme Court. The admiration was apparently mutual, according to Scalia's literary collaborator Bryan Garner. According to Garner's memoir, Scalia \"thought it was most refreshing to have a candidate who was pretty much unfiltered and utterly frank.\"\n\nMr. Trump noted that Scalia and his wife, who was accepting the medal on her husband's behalf, had nine children. \"You were very busy.

She and her husband own the Las Vegas Review-Journal and Israel Hayom newspapers, which often stake out pro-Trump positions.\n\nThe Adelsons are also avid supporters of Israel. Their passion for strengthening the country, along with Israel-U.S. relations, has helped keep such policy priorities as relocating the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem front and center in the Republican Party and the Trump administration.\n\nMr. Trump moved the embassy in May, and Sheldon Adelson, who had offered to personally fund the move, was seated in the front row for the ceremony.\n\nRobert Weissman, president of public interest group Public Citizen, said it was difficult to believe the decision to recognize Miriam Adelson was based on merit.\n\n\"It's emblematic of the corrupt and transactional presidency of Donald Trump, and it is a shame, but not a surprise, that he is corroding and corrupting a civic treasure, an honor like the Medal of Freedom,\" Weissman said.\n\nLindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, said Mr. Trump used the process that previous administrations have followed to settle on his group of honorees. The process was coordinated by the office of the staff secretary, taking into account recommendations from the public, relevant presidential advisory bodies, the Cabinet and senior White House staff, she said.\n\nThe award is given to individuals \"who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.\"\n\nMiriam Adelson said she is \"deeply humbled and moved by this exceptional honor.\"\n\n\"Liberty is at the heart of my decades of work against substance abuse.

He said he left his quest for notoriety behind long ago and is devoted to promoting the transformative power of Jesus.\n\n\n\nHe said he realizes the pain he caused will linger \"even after I die.\"\n\n\n\nIn its decision, the state Board of Parole said releasing Chapman would not only \"tend to mitigate the seriousness of your crime,\" but also would endanger public safety because \"someone may attempt to or succeed in harming you out of anger and or revenge, or for the same reason that you did John Lennon; to assume notoriety.\"\n\n\"You admittedly carefully planned and executed the murder of a world-famous person for no reason other than to gain notoriety,\" the three-member panel wrote in a decision obtained by CBS News. \"While no one person's life is any more valuable than another's life, the fact that you chose someone who was not only a world renown person and beloved by millions, regardless of the pain and suffering you would cause to his family, friends and so many others, you demonstrated a callous disregard for the sanctity of human life and the pain and suffering of others. This fact remains a concern to this panel.\"\n\nChapman will be up for parole again in August 2020."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "CTM Spotify Playlist: November 16, 2018", "description": "Keep up with the music we play on \"CBS This Morning\"", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-this-morning-spotify-playlist-november-16-2018/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/07/16/7eb1f08e-72fa-45e4-a106-fa4b015382ce/thumbnail/1200x630/8970f80b00327b49efdfd077f5ebd79a/u2-b48a9492.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:31:15Z", "content": "We take our music seriously at \"CBS This Morning.\" Keep up with the music we play on the broadcast by following our \"CBS This Morning\" Spotify playlist and checking CBSThisMorning.com for daily playlist posts. \"Where The Streets Have No Name\" \u2013 U2 \"Us\" \u2013 Regi\u2026 [+637 chars]", "fulltext": "We take our music seriously at \"CBS This Morning.\" Keep up with the music we play on the broadcast by following our \"CBS This Morning\" Spotify playlist and checking CBSThisMorning.com for daily playlist posts.\n\n\"Where The Streets Have No Name\" \u2013 U2\n\n\"Us\" \u2013 Regina Spektor\n\n\"These Hard Times\" \u2013 Matchbox Twenty\n\n\"No Scrubs\" \u2013 TLC\n\n\"You've Got A Friend In Me \u2013 From \"Toy Story\" / Soundtrack\" \u2013 Randy Newman\n\n\"Gates\" \u2013 The Menzingers\n\n\"Glorious\" \u2013 Macklemore, Skylar Grey\n\n\"Found Out About You\" \u2013 Gin Blossoms\n\n\"Come\" \u2013 Jain\n\n\"Downtown\" \u2013Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Melle Mel, Grandmaster Caz, Kool Moe Dee, Eric Nally\n\n\"Black Balloon\" \u2013 The Goo Goo Dolls\n\n\"Night Sky\" \u2013 CHVRCHES\n\n\"Winter Wonderland\" \u2013 Michael Buble\n\n\"Riptide\" \u2013 Vance Joy\n\n\"Cold Cold Man\" \u2013 Saint Motel\n\n\"Can't Hold Us\" \u2013 Macklemore & Ryan Lewis\n\n\"Painting A Hole\" \u2013 The Shins\n\n\"All The Stars\" \u2013 Kendrick Lamar, SZA\n\n\"Velvet Snow\" \u2013 Kings of Leon"}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Number of people missing in California's wildfires passes 600", "description": "The number of people missing in California's wildfires has soared to over 600, and the death toll has risen to 66.

Maybe we want to make it just a little more difficult.

Hyde-Smith was making a joke and clearly the video was selectively edited.\"\n\nEspy campaign spokesman Danny Blanton said: \"For a state like Mississippi, where voting rights were obtained through sweat and blood, everyone should appreciate that this is not a laughing matter. Mississippians deserve a senator who represents our best qualities, not a walking stereotype who embarrasses our state.\"\n\nEspy is seeking to become Mississippi's first African-American U.S. senator since Reconstruction.\n\nHyde-Smith, endorsed by President Donald Trump, is the first woman to represent Mississippi in either chamber of Congress. She has served since April, after Mississippi's governor appointed her to temporarily succeed longtime Republican Sen. Cochran, who retired.\n\nA political ad on Facebook this week uses a 1930 photo of a white crowd in Indiana posing around a tree as the lifeless bodies of two black men hang above them, lynched in nooses. The ad superimposes an unrelated photo of Hyde-Smith as text appears: \"This is where U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith would like to be.\"\n\nThe ad is paid for by PowerPACPlus, a California-based political action committee that has spent nearly $1.8 million in other advertising to support Espy.\n\nA video that surfaced Sunday shows Hyde-Smith at a Nov. 2 campaign event in Tupelo making the \"public hanging\" comment. She said the phrase was \"an exaggerated expression of regard\" for the supporter and \"any attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous.\" At a news conference Monday, she would not answer reporters' repeated questions about the \"hanging\" comment.\n\nBoth Espy and the Hyde-Smith campaign condemned the ad.\n\n\"This is the same out-of-state group that is spending millions of dollars promoting Mike Espy and has now taken his campaign to the lowest depths imaginable,\" Scallan said. \"It is time for Mike Espy to tell his group to end this appalling, divisive attack.\"\n\nEspy said his campaign doesn't control what PowerPACPlus does, and he called the ad \"not helpful.\"\n\n\"I can't make them pull it down because we didn't ask them to put it up,\" Espy said. \"It's racially divisive. It's something that we didn't endorse, and we'd like them to pull it down.\"\n\nUnder federal campaign laws, super PACs are not allowed to coordinate with candidates.\n\nThe PowerPACPlus website says the group's mission is \"to build the political power of America's multiracial majority.\"\n\nMarvin Randolph, spokesman for PowerPACPlus, said the ad with the lynching image is the first in a series of online ads that will be supported by at least $25,000 in spending.\n\n\"We expect to reach over a million viewers online,\" Randolph said. \"This ad will also appear on Instagram and Twitter.\"\n\nBoth national parties are putting money and effort into the special election.

That was not the intended name for this filing.\" The Eastern District has been investigating Assange's actions.\n\nAny charges against Assange could help illuminate whether Russia coordinated with the Trump campaign to sway the 2016 presidential election. It would also suggest that, after years of internal wrangling within the Justice Department, prosecutors have decided to take a more aggressive tact against the secret-sharing website.\n\nThe Washington Post reported late Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter, that Assange had indeed been charged. CBS News has not been able to confirm that.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what charges Assange, who has been holed up for more than six years in the embassy, might face.\n\nBut recently ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions last year declared the arrest of Assange a priority. Special counsel Robert Mueller has been investigating whether Trump campaign associates had advance knowledge of Democratic emails that were published by WikiLeaks in the weeks before the 2016 election and that U.S. authorities have said were hacked by Russia. Any arrest could represent a significant development for Mueller's investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the election.\n\nBarry Pollack, a lawyer for Assange, told the AP earlier this week that he had no information about possible charges against Assange.\n\nIn a new statement, he said, \"The news that criminal charges have apparently been filed against Mr. Assange is even more troubling than the haphazard manner in which that information has been revealed. The government bringing criminal charges against someone for publishing truthful information is a dangerous path for a democracy to take.\"\n\nWikiLeaks condemned what it referred to as \"public confirmation\" of pending U.S. charges against its founder in a statement on Friday.\n\n\"U.S. authorities have consistently refused to confirm the existence of any such charges, while the U.K. government has been unwilling to confirm or deny that an extradition request for Mr. Assange has been received,\" the organization said. \"Mr. Assange has consistently stated his desire to engage with any legal processes in the U.K., as long as there is a guarantee of no extradition to the U.S. where he could face life in prison, or worse.\"\n\nThe filing was discovered by Seamus Hughes, a terrorism expert at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, who posted it on Twitter hours after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department was preparing to prosecute Assange and said, \"To be clear, seems Freudian, it's for a different completely unrelated case, every other page is not related to him, EDVA just appears to have Assange on the mind when filing motions to seal and used his name.\"\n\nAssange, 47, has resided in the Ecuadorian Embassy in a bid to avoid being extradited to Sweden, where he was wanted to sex crimes, or to the United States, whose government he has repeatedly humbled with mass disclosures of classified information.\n\nThe Australian ex-hacker was once a welcome guest at the Embassy, which takes up part of the ground floor of a stucco-fronted apartment in London's posh Knightsbridge neighborhood. But his relationship with his hosts has soured over the years amid reports of espionage, erratic behavior and diplomatic unease.\n\nAny criminal charge is sure to further complicate the already tense relationship.\n\nEcuadorian officials say they have cut off the WikiLeaks founder's internet access and will restore it only if he agrees to stop interfering in the affairs of Ecuador's partners -- such as the United States and Spain. Officials have also imposed a series of other restrictions on Assange's activities and visitors and -- notably -- ordered him to clean up after his cat.\n\nWith shrinking options (an Ecuadorian lawsuit seeking to reverse the restrictions was recently turned down) WikiLeaks announced in September that former spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson, an Icelandic journalist who has long served as one of Assange's lieutenants, would take over as editor-in-chief.\n\nWikiLeaks has attracted U.S. attention since 2010, when it published thousands of military and State Department documents from Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning. In a Twitter post early Friday, WikiLeaks said the \"US case against WikiLeaks started in 2010\" and expanded to include other disclosures, including by contractor Edward Snowden.\n\n\"The prosecutor on the order is not from Mr. Mueller's team and WikiLeaks has never been contacted by anyone from his office,\" WikiLeaks said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "North Korea: The art of surviving sanctions", "description": "Behind the Kim regime\u2019s scramble to stay afloat through cultural means", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/north-korea-the-art-of-surviving-sanctions/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/16/a5dd1fb6-0252-4a6c-bd26-ae5f23871d28/thumbnail/1200x630/409ca2ba33b2d2ff671f21b8f02c358e/northkoreasanctionsthumb-1713545-640x360.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:02:40Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Jeff Berardelli", "title": "Early snowstorm causes havoc \u2013 what went wrong?", "description": "A meteorologist explains how so many warning signs were missed \u2013 and why we may see more of this in the future", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/snowstorm-nyc-traffic-port-authority-forecast-what-went-wrong/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/16/85fdfbc2-54e8-4706-8435-8d0bfa54868d/thumbnail/1200x630/cff95554bfb460574744cf2570835009/snow-traffic.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:01:57Z", "content": "Boots or shoes?

I\u2019ll be on til 10:30pm keeping you updated on the latest conditions @wcbs880traffic #FirstSnow #Snowvember pic.twitter.com/5eV6LxmyS8 \u2014 Kelly Dillon (@kelly_dillon) November 15, 2018\n\nTo be fair, a snowstorm of this magnitude this early in the season is with very little precedent. Central Park officially measured 6.4 inches of snow, the heaviest early season and November daily snowfall since record-keeping began nearly 150 years ago.\n\nBut I'd be lying to you if I said that we meteorologists were not alerted to the warning signs ahead of time. As early as last Wednesday, November 7, many computer models were showing signs of a full-fledged snowy Nor'easter for the period of Wednesday to Friday of this week. After a quick tease, the storm either disappeared from most models or just appeared way too warm for any meaningful snow.\n\nBut then this Monday the storm came roaring back on the models, including the infamous European model, arguably the best medium-range forecast model available. Since then, the European has been rock-solid steady, run after run, day after day, forecasting a half a foot of snow for New York City.\n\nWorth noting the European model has been incredibly consistent for days on approx. 6\u201d snow for #NYC. This Image from Mon eve model run. Understandable forecasters had doubts as this breaks ~150 year Nov. record. But evidence was there to raise eye brows. #EuroIsKing #Snowvember pic.twitter.com/9wU65Pplje \u2014 Jeff Berardelli (@WeatherProf) November 16, 2018\n\nIBM's \"Deep Thunder\" model stayed aggressive as well, showing several inches. Other models, including the American models, at times also advised of significant snowfall.\n\nAdding to the evidence before us, most forecast models showed a burst of heavy snow lasting a few hours with temperatures near or just above the freezing mark. It's just the kind of atmospheric setup that can rapidly cool the atmosphere and quickly pile up the snow.\n\nBut unlike the European model, many others were just not that consistent. Either flip-flopping on snow totals, or waiting until the very end to recognize the potential. Forecasters were more eager to believe the less aggressive, naysayer models because it's what we expect of November.\n\nThe area's National Weather Service (NWS) station, in Upton, Long Island, started mentioning measurable snow in the forecast on Tuesday. Considering the models had evidence to support this on Monday, 24 hours was a reasonable time to wait to make sure the signs were clear before forecasting an early season snowfall. But as the storm drew closer, their forecast was slow to evolve.\n\nOn Wednesday the Upton NWS office was still calling for only an inch of snow in the city. Thursday morning, the day of the storm, the NWS forecast map still indicated just 1 inch of snow expected in the city and a zero percent \u2014 zero! \u2014 chance of 6-inch accumulation.\n\nNational Weather Service\n\nAdvisories were not issued for New York City's five boroughs until the actual afternoon of the storm, when the NWS increased the forecast to 2-5\" of accumulation \u2014 a better representation of the storm that was about to begin.\n\nThere's no doubt the delay in issuing official advisories played into a seemingly underwhelming city response, although New York Mayor Bill de Blasio did mention NYC Sanitation preparations were underway the night before the snow started.\n\nThere's a good chance we're going to have our first snowfall of the season tomorrow. Crews at @NYCSanitation have issued a snow alert, and are ready to handle whatever happens. Please be prepared and exercise caution during your commute tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/Bux8UwTjdE \u2014 Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) November 14, 2018\n\nJudging by the condition of the snowy, traffic-clogged streets and overwhelmed public transit systems, few if anyone expected the heavy accumulation and chaos that ensued.\n\nTransportation & transit are the lifeblood of our city. 6-8 inches of snow crippled #NYC and this is unacceptable. Moms are stranded with their kids, subway platforms are overcrowded. This is unacceptable & we need action so it doesn\u2019t happen again. #NYC https://t.co/HMs10vio4t \u2014 Adriano Espaillat (@RepEspaillat) November 16, 2018\n\nThe climate and the odds\n\nSo what happened? Why did forecasters underestimate this storm?\n\nThe answer is simple. All of our experience tells us that mid-November is just too early for a disruptive snowstorm like this in New York City. Sure, we know it can snow in November. Sometimes there's heavy accumulation, but almost never near the coast. The ocean is a big influence and water temperatures are still in the 50s. And even if it were to accumulate, forecasters rationalize, surely the warm urban streets and highways will melt the snow on contact. So maybe there will be a few inches on the grass, but the streets won't be worse than a little slushy. As a forecaster I can tell you that this thought process was going through the minds of most trained meteorologists just before the storm.\n\nThese are all great rationalizations. Ninety-nine percent of the time they will be right. But this was that 1 percent.\n\nIn this case our life experience outweighed our forecast experience and training. We let \"what are the odds this could happen in November?\" get in the way of what should have been a challenging, but doable forecast. If this exact same pattern appeared on the models in January the forecast would have come with plenty of warning and higher snow potential. Statistics and human psychology would not have gotten in the way.\n\nBut perhaps it's time for forecasters to expect the unexpected? These early season snows seem to be happening more often in this area. In fact, this is at least the third time since 2011.\n\nOn October 29, 2011 New York City picked up 2.9 inches of snow in what became known as #Snowtober or the 2011 Halloween Nor'easter. Other parts of the Northeast were crippled with over 30 inches! For New York City, it was by far the heaviest snow on record in October and only the third time since 1869 that measurable snow was recorded in October.\n\nThe next year up to 2 feet of heavy snow fell during Hurricane Sandy in the Appalachians. Barely a week later, on November 7-8, 2012, while coastal areas hit by Sandy had just started to pick up the pieces, up to a foot of heavy snow blanketed the Jersey shore.\n\nWhile I was growing up in the 1970s and 80s in New York City, there was really only one meaningful early season snowfall. That was Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 1989, when nearly 5 inches of snow fell.\n\nThe point is that significant snowstorms in New York City are very rare before December. Yet three have occurred in the past seven years. So is it chance? Or is it possible that our changing climate is turning the unexpected into something more common?\n\nWhile is true the world is seeing more extremes, it's premature to draw conclusions on early season snowstorms like this. However, as a meteorologist with a lot of experience under my belt, I can tell you things seem off-kilter.\n\nIn the past few years evidence has been building among climate scientists for a more erratic jet stream, which controls storm tracks. Numerous scientific papers have been published citing evidence for current and projected changes in storm tracks. Last winter's pattern provided a lot of ammunition for that argument with wicked, long lasting cold across the eastern US, followed by a prolonged stretch of very warm weather. Then in March, the Northeast was hit by a barrage of four Nor'easters in just three weeks \u2014 an astonishing atmospheric feat!\n\nThe Four Nor'easters of March. pic.twitter.com/r73MvpWvyK \u2014 Dakota Smith (@weatherdak) March 22, 2018\n\nPenn State climate scientist Michael Mann has been studying the jet stream-climate change connection for years. He wrote about the theory last winter:\n\n\"\u2026recent research suggests that climate change may be favoring this contrast in temperature by causing the jet stream to meander in a particular pattern, with an upward meander or \"ridge\" in the west bringing warm air up from the south and a downward meander or \"trough\" in the east, bringing cold air down from the north. Some scientists think that the dramatic loss of sea ice in the Arctic may be favoring this jet stream pattern.\"\n\nWhile there is still some disagreement on how climate change is changing the jet stream, there is very good agreement that climate change is having an effect and will continue to change the jet stream in the future. As extreme weather events increase, scientists are getting better at detecting the climate change signals using attribution studies.\n\nAs for these oddball early season snows, the jury is still out. Perhaps climate scientists will tackle this question next?"}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "David Morgan", "title": "Cindy McCain: Two of the her children may have political aspirations", "description": "The widow of the Arizona Senator says she believes the McCain name will be carried forward in public office", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cindy-mccain-at-least-one-of-my-children-has-caught-the-politics-bug/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/16/33c86728-7a0b-45ce-8fc4-d0bd4ed5c9bc/thumbnail/1200x630/5b13f689285542a2b95a9599392e9993/a-cam-dickerson-cindy-mccain-frame-13779.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T13:53:36Z", "content": "Cindy McCain, the widow of Arizona Senator John McCain, said that although she had been approached to fill her husband's seat after his death, she said she never spoke with him about it. \"My job right now is to make sure my family's OK and make sure that we a\u2026 [+3305 chars]", "fulltext": "Cindy McCain, the widow of Arizona Senator John McCain, said that although she had been approached to fill her husband's seat after his death, she said she never spoke with him about it. \"My job right now is to make sure my family's OK and make sure that we are moving on in the right direction,\" she said.\n\nAnd if she isn't going to carry the McCain name forward in politics, she said, \"I got a house full\" of prospects.\n\nIn an interview on \"CBS This Morning\" Friday, McCain said one or two of her children have political aspirations.\"There are two I know that won't, but there's two that I think will.\"\n\nShe declined to name which of their four children (John McCain had three other children from a previous marriage), but added, \"They've all grown up in politics.

It is being discussed as Georgia elections officials appear to be on the cusp of certifying Republican Brian Kemp as the winner of a bitterly fought campaign that's been marred by charges of electoral malfeasance.\n\nTop Abrams advisers outlined her prospective case to The Associated Press, stressing that the Democratic candidate hasn't finalized a decision about whether to proceed once state officials certify Kemp as the victor. That could happen as early as Friday evening.\n\nAllegra Lawrence-Hardy, Abrams' campaign chairwoman, is overseeing a team of almost three-dozen lawyers who in the coming days will draft the petition, along with a ream of affidavits from voters and would-be voters who say they were disenfranchised. Abrams would then decide whether to go to court under a provision of Georgia election law that allows losing candidates to challenge results based on \"misconduct, fraud or irregularities ... sufficient to change or place in doubt the results.\"\n\nThe legal team is \"considering all options,\" Lawrence-Hardy said, including federal court remedies. But the state challenge is the most drastic. And some Democratic legal observers note Abrams would be dependent on statutes that set a high bar for the court to intervene.\n\nShe already faces a narrow path to the governor's mansion. Unofficial returns show Kemp with about 50.2 percent of more than 3.9 million votes. That puts him about 18,000 votes above the threshold required to win by a majority and avoid a Dec. 4 runoff. The Associated Press is not calling the race until state officials certify the results.\n\nAbrams would assert that enough irregularities occurred to raise the possibility that at least 18,000 Georgians either had their ballots thrown out or were not allowed to vote.\n\nLawrence-Hardy told the AP that Abrams will weigh legal considerations alongside her belief that many of her backers \u2014 particularly minority and poorer voters who don't regularly go to the polls \u2014 heeded her call to participate and ran into barriers.\n\n\"These stories to me are such that they have to be addressed,\" said Lawrence-Hardy, who was among the army of lawyers who worked on the Bush v. Gore presidential election dispute in 2000. \"It's just a much bigger responsibility. I feel like our mandate has blossomed. ... Maybe this is our moment.\"\n\nKemp, who served as the state's chief elections officer until two days after the election when he resigned as secretary of state and declared victory, has maintained that any uncounted ballots won't change the outcome. His campaign has called Abrams' legal maneuvers so far a \"disgrace to democracy\" and an attempt to \"count illegal votes.\"\n\nThe circumstances leave Abrams, a 44-year-old rising Democratic star, with a tough decision. The former state lawmaker became a national political celebrity with her bid to become the first black woman in American history to be elected governor. Her strategy of running as an unapologetic liberal who attracts new voters to the polls resonated in a rapidly changing state. Yet Abrams also must consider her own political future and the consequences of a protracted legal fight she might not win.\n\nAll of that is playing out against the backdrop of Kemp's unabashed embrace of President Donald Trump's nationalism.\n\nSince Election Day, Abrams campaign workers have transitioned from get-out-the-vote efforts to helping voters determine whether their ballots were counted and documenting reported problems. The idea is to assemble a body of evidence to support the claim that the problems could account for Kemp's 18,000-vote margin above the runoff trigger.\n\nAffidavits from poll workers reviewed by the AP describe long lines that discouraged people from voting, poll workers failing to offer provisional ballots to people who didn't show up on the rolls or were at the wrong polling place and election equipment that froze and had to be rebooted.\n\nCathy Cox, a Democrat who served as secretary of state from 1999 through 2007 and is now the dean of Mercer University's law school, said Georgia law puts a heavy burden on candidates such as Abrams who ask a court to intervene.\n\n\"I would say with pretty great confidence there has probably never been an election ... without some irregularity, where some poll worker did not make some mistake,\" Cox said in an interview. The key, she said, is proving someone erred to the point that it could change the outcome.\n\nLawrence-Hardy agreed the law requires a quantitative analysis. She said Abrams' team doesn't have a list of 18,000 disenfranchised voters. The evidence, she said, would consist of hundreds, if not thousands of such examples, along with data analysis of projected lost votes based on other problems, such as a lack of paper ballots at precincts where voting machines broke down and voters left long lines.\n\nCox said courts must attempt to apply a nonpartisan standard of \"doubt\" to the election. \"Would a reasonable person have a reason to doubt this election? Not would a hard-core partisan Democrat doubt a partisan Republican opponent,\" she said.\n\nAbrams and voting rights activists have argued for months that Kemp mismanaged the elections system as secretary of state, with Abrams often calling Kemp \"an architect of suppression.\"\n\nUnder Georgia law, Abrams could file a challenge against Kemp or his successor as the secretary of state. The challenge must be filed within five days of certification in a trial court of the county where the chosen defendant resides. The defendant has between five and 10 days to respond, and the presiding judge sets a hearing within 20 days after that deadline, a calendar that could push a dispute well beyond what would have been a Dec. 4 runoff.\n\nIf the judge determines the election is so defective that it casts doubt on the results, the judge can declare the election invalid and call a new vote among the same candidates. Cox called that \"the real extreme remedy.\"\n\nA more \"surgical\" course, she said, would be to affirm irregularities but only order that certified results be reopened and recertified once those problems are remedied. The judge could then declare a winner or order a runoff if the results are close enough.\n\nThe judge could also declare a winner after hearing the evidence, but Cox said that's unlikely because the case will probably hinge on uncounted votes and there's no way to know before a count which candidate won those votes.\n\nOnce the judge rules, the loser has 10 days to appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Apartment 4C: How social media helped reveal a murdered man's final hours", "description": "Social media helped uncover the final steps of a Connecticut man who was murdered in New York City.

No cause has been determined, but speculation has centered on PG&E, which reported an outage around when and where the fire ignited.\n\nSuch speculation was anything but idle. California state investigators in June faulted PG&E-owned power lines for sparking a dozen blazes in Northern California in the fall of 2017 that killed 46 and incinerated nearly 9,000 homes and other structures.\n\nOn Thursday, authorities said the death toll from California's Camp Fire has risen to 63, bringing the statewide count to 66. In addition, more than 600 people have now been reported missing, according to the Butte County Sheriff's Office.\n\nPlummeting shares\n\nPG&E's potential liability for the deaths and massive property loss in the Camp Fire is slamming the company financially. Shares of the utility plunged as much as 32 percent on Thursday and are down nearly 63 percent since Nov. 8. The company's market value has declined by $15 billion.\n\nThe company's filing last month said it needed to boost revenue to keep investors from fleeing, noting that its credit rating was downgraded and its shares had plummeted since the 2017 fires.\n\nWildfires threaten PG&E's ability to attract and maintain the investment necessary to support its system and meet California's clean energy goals, company spokeswoman Lynsey Paulo said.\n\n\"PG&E's electrical system is not immune from the impact of increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather,\" Paulo said.\n\nTerray Sylvester / REUTERS\n\nCalifornia Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) President Michael Picker sought to calm financial markets late Thursday with a statement noting \"an essential component of providing safe electrical service is the financial wherewithal to carry out safety measures.\" But he added that he's expanding an investigation of PG&E's safety culture to look at the company's \"corporate governance, structure and operation.\"\n\nPG&E shares rebounded in after-hours trading, regaining Thursday's losses but remaining far below their value when the fire broke out.\n\nHeight Commentary analyst Clayton Allen wrote in a research note that the regulators' comments indicate they will be a \"constructive influence,\" including a comment from a CPUC official that \"the Commission does not want PG&E (PCG) to go into bankruptcy.\"\n\nThe company has $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents after drawing down all of its revolving credit facility, and it has an additional $1.4 billion in wildfire insurance coverage, according to a filing. In statement to CBS MoneyWatch, PG&E said it tapped its credit facility \"to provide greater financial flexibility, including to pay down upcoming debt maturities and for general business purposes.\"\n\nAn analyst at Citi Investment Research estimated damages could exceed $15 billion. And the company's potential liability for last year's fires has been pegged at upward of $10 billion.\n\nRate hike request\n\nThe company said in its rate-hike request that the extreme wildfire risk justified a higher profit than an average utility is allowed to earn. It cites a California legal standard holding utilities entirely liable for damage caused by their equipment regardless of whether the company was negligent.\n\nA state law approved this year makes it easier for the company to raise rates to pay off lawsuits, but the company says it still faces high risk and got no relief for fires that started this year.\n\nThe precipitous drop in the stock price shows investors are taking into account not just the fires but also the risk of future wildfires for which the utility could be responsible, analysts said.\n\n\"It's going to be very difficult for PG&E to finance its needs in the short run, so we think at this point, regulators need to step in and give the market some reassurance,\" said Travis Miller, a strategist at Morningstar.\n\nPG&E is asking for a 9.5 percent increase in transmission charges \u2014 the cost of high-voltage lines that move power across large distances. That amounts to about $1.50 more per month for the average residential customer, Paulo said.\n\nPoor management?\n\nAdvocates for utility customers have balked at PG&E's contention that it needs to raise rates because of wildfires. They say its problems are the result of poor management decisions.\n\n\"We don't pay electric bills in order to keep bailing PG&E out from its own negligence and incompetence, and we can't afford it,\" said Mindy Spatt, communications director for The Utility Reform Network.\n\nSome analysts believe PG&E will be able to survive financially as long as there isn't another major catastrophe. But wildfires are getting bigger, deadlier and more destructive as housing pushes into rural areas and drought and high temperatures tied to climate change become the norm.\n\n\"The business doesn't earn enough money to pay for that in any kind of regular way,\" said Michael Wara, director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program at Stanford University. \"These have to be extreme, once-in-a-generation events.\"\n\nPG&E's ability to raise capital will be constrained, so it will probably be forced to cut back on expenses such as replacing aging equipment, analysts said. California utilities also need to invest in the type of upgrades that will allow the state to meet its aggressive renewable energy and carbon reduction goals.\n\nFire investigators have blamed PG&E equipment for 12 of last year's wildfires, including two that killed 15 people combined. In eight of those fires, investigators said they found evidence of violations of state law and forwarded the findings to prosecutors.\n\nThe company is facing dozens of lawsuits from insurers and people who lost their homes in last year.

Hours after the report, however, a senior Turkish official in Ankara said the country had, \"no intention to intervene in the Khashoggi investigation in return for any political or legal favor.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Security Council and the State Department have both rejected, sort of, the NBC report. The NSC told CBS News that it had \"not been involved in nor aware of any discussions relating the extradition of Fethullah Gulen to the death of Jamal Khashoggi.\"\n\nState Department spokesperson Heather Nauert accused media organizations of trying to \"conflate\" the two cases, but said Gulen's case was still under consideration by the Justice Department.\n\nThe Justice Department has not issued any new statements regarding its consideration of evidence from Turkey, which Ankara says implicates Gulen in a 2016 failed coup attempt. For years the U.S. government has rejected Turkish requests for his extradition, saying their evidence is insufficient.\n\nTurkey keeps pressure on the Saudis\n\n\"At no point did Turkey offer to hold back on the Khashoggi investigation in return for Fetullah Gulen's extradition,\" the senior Turkish official said on Thursday.\n\nIt is clear the Turks want to keep the fire to the Saudi royal family's feet.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said his country is convinced that an order to kill Khashoggi came from the \"highest levels\" of the Saudi government. That can only mean one thing in the tightly controlled, ultra-conservative Islamic kingdom; the all-powerful royal family.\n\nTurkish officials have said on the record that they don't believe Saudi Arabia's King Salman was behind the killing, but they have not exonerated his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nSenior U.S. lawmakers, intelligence officials and many analysts believe the crown prince, often known by his initials MBS, was in fact aware of the operation to kill Khashoggi, and likely ordered it.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in Riyadh on Thursday, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir called the killing a \"very big mistake\" but insisted the crown prince had \"absolutely nothing to do\" with it.\n\nHis remarks came after Saudi Arabia announced that its own investigation into the Khashoggi case had found that an ex-intelligence chief, who had close ties to MBS, was responsible for the killing. The Saudi chief prosecutor said the kingdom would seek the death penalty for five people found guilty of the actual murder, which took place in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.\n\nTurkish officials were unconvinced by the outcome of the Saudis' own investigation into the murder, with Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu calling the Saudi prosecutor's announcements \"insufficient.\"\n\n\"I want to say that we did not find some of his explanations to be satisfactory\" and that \"those who gave the order, the real perpetrators need to be revealed. This process cannot be closed down in this way,\" Cavusoglu said, according to The Associated Press.\n\nBuzzfeed quoted an advisor to Turkey's president as saying the Saudi prosecution's charges, at least, amounted to a cover-up.\n\n\"They expect us to believe the killers carried this out on their own. This isn't very credible,\" Erdogan advisor Yasin Aktay said, according to Buzzfeed. \"Everything is clear as day, but there is an effort to cover it up a bit.\"\n\nWhat the U.S. has and hasn't done so far\n\nThe U.S. government has tread cautiously thus far in its handling of the Khashoggi case and the allegations that a close ally and key trading partner ordered the journalist killed in its own diplomatic mission.\n\nPresident Trump has made it clear that he doesn't want to endanger the U.S.-Saudi financial relationship, worth $450 billion dollars including $110 billion in arms sales alone, over the murder of a U.S.-based journalist.\n\n\"I don't want to lose all of that investment being made into our country. I don't want to lose a million jobs,\" Mr. Trump has said.\n\nThe Saudis, and Crown Prince Salman in particular, are also vital allies to the White House as it pushes to contain Iran's influence in the Middle East. Iran and Saudi Arabia are bitter regional foes.\n\nOn Thursday, just after the Saudis announced their charges against 18 individuals the kingdom accuses of the killing, the U.S. government announced its own sanctions against 17 people it has concluded were culpable.\n\n\"The Saudi officials we are sanctioning were involved in the abhorrent killing of Jamal Khashoggi,\" Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said in a statement announcing the measures.\n\nMissing from the list of individuals sanctioned by the U.S. was the man the Saudis accuse of ring-leading the killing, ex-deputy intelligence chief Ahmad al-Assiri.\n\nThe U.S. sanctions target 15 people identified by Turkey as the \"hit-squad\" which traveled from Saudi Arabia to Turkey specifically to kill Khashoggi. Also among the 17 is Saudi Arabia's former top diplomat in Istanbul, Mohamed al-Otaibi and Royal Court advisor Saud al-Qahtani.\n\nPresident Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton has said audio evidence the Turks have, which they claim proves Khashoggi's murder was premeditated, does not implicate MBS. He has not heard the audio evidence himself, but CIA chief Gina Haspel has.\n\nBut the pressure will remain on the Trump administration to keep prodding Saudi Arabia to come up with a full explanation.\n\n\"The intel that I'm aware of points to MBS,\" Sen. Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has said. \"There's no smoking gun, but I don't think there's any question that he directed it, knew it, and we've got to figure out a way to cause (Saudi Arabia) to pay a price.\"\n\nAnnouncing the sanctions against the Saudis on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said the U.S. \"continues to diligently work to ascertain all of the facts and will hold accountable each of those we find responsible in order to achieve justice for Khashoggi's fianc\u00e9e, children, and the family he leaves behind. The government of Saudi Arabia must take appropriate steps to end any targeting of political dissidents or journalists.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "North Korea tests \"ultramodern tactical weapon\"", "description": "North Korea is reporting that the country has tested a new \"ultramodern tactical weapon.\" Kim Jong Un witnessed the test but did not offer any details about the weapon itself.

Facebook followed suit a day later.\n\n\"We are publishing our updated Workplace Relationships policy and amending our arbitration agreements to make arbitration a choice rather than a requirement in sexual harassment claims,\" a Facebook spokesperson said in an email. \"Sexual harassment is something that we take very seriously and there is no place for it at Facebook.\"\n\nArbitration is a private process whose proceedings and resolutions are often confidential, in which the employer often pays for and picks the arbitrator, giving the employer an upper hand from the start, advocates for workers contend.\n\n\"Forced arbitration agreements are a huge problem for workers,\" said Maya Raghu, director of workplace equality and senior counsel at the National Women's Law Center. \"It makes them give up their right to their day in court in exchange for a job.\"\n\nOn Monday, Airbnb issued a statement saying the company would \"not require our employees to use arbitration in cases involving discrimination in the workplace,\" and would do the same in cases involving sexual harassment. The changes, the company emailed, \"reflect conversations we have had with employees and outside experts.\"\n\neBay also no longer requires sexual harassment claims to be settled through private arbitration. \"We've adjusted our existing employee policy regarding sexual harassment claims to better reflect and encourage eBay's values of being open, honest and direct,\" a spokesperson emailed.\n\nSquare ended its policy of forcing employees into private arbitration in cases of sexual harassment at work, according to reporting from BuzzFeed News. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"It's very positive. I don't think we would have seen it without the MeToo movement, without workers walking off their jobs,\" said Angela Cornell, a clinical professor of law and director of the Labor Law Clinic at Cornell Law School.\n\nMicrosoft was an early advocate for ending the agreements that critics contend help cover sexual harassment at work by keeping the claims out of court. In December 2017, it said it had dispensed with forced arbitration.\n\nUber and Lyft in May said they were eliminating forced arbitration agreements for employees, riders and drivers who make sexual assault or harassment claims against the companies.\n\n\"It is significant that in response to worker and public pressure, some large corporations are starting to change their practices and are restoring to workers the option of taking such claims to court,\" said Raghu. \"It helps put pressure on their peers to do so.\"\n\nCompanies don't publicize the practice of requiring employees to sign such agreements, but they are believed to be widespread. More than half, at least 55 percent, of workers are subject to forced arbitration, estimated the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute in a recent report. Clauses typically cover a range of employment disputes, including sexual harassment and civil rights violations.\n\nThe changes Google and Facebook have made are important, yet limited, said Raghu. She noted the policy updates appear limited to sexual harassment and assault claims, and leave out other forms of harassment and discrimination. Further, Google's policy change is explicitly limited to \"individual\" claims and seems to still enforce arbitration for collective or class claims, in which workers join forces to challenge harassment or discrimination, she added.\n\nThe National Employment Lawyers Association, a trade group of lawyers who represent workers, believes 80 of the companies in the Fortune 100 use arbitration and at least 52 use forced arbitration, but an exact accounting is difficult.\n\nAs Terry O'Neill, the group's executive director, told The Washington Post: \"It's remarkably difficult to find that out, because these are secret employment agreements.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Manual ballot recount ordered in Florida Senate race", "description": "Florida is close to learning who will be its next governor, while the closely fought Senate race is headed for a hand recount.

Charging documents describe a situation in which some of the nation's most elite military personnel - including two members of the famed SEAL Team Six - broke into a Green Beret's bedroom while he was sleeping, bound him with duct tape and put him into a choke hold.\n\nThe charges do not allege a specific motive. But the counts filed against the four men range from felony murder to involuntary manslaughter. They also have been charged with hazing.\n\nThe Navy has also accused them of obstructing justice after the Green Beret's death: Officials said the men disposed of alcohol that was kept in quarters shared by sailors and Marines and also lied to Navy commanders and investigators.\n\nThe man who died was Army Staff Sergeant Logan Melgar, a native of Lubbock, Texas. He had deployed to Afghanistan twice before his death in Bamako, Mali, in June 2017, Army officials said.\n\nMelgar was a member of the same special forces group as the four Americans who were killed while on patrol in Niger last year, CBS News correspondent David Martin reported. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) fighters who ambushed and killed the four soldiers were based in Mali and escaped back across the border.\n\nThe charging documents don't state why the service members were in Mali. But U.S. Special Forces have been in Africa to support and train local troops in their fight against extremists.\n\nThe names of the service members who have been charged are redacted in the charging documents. Beth Baker, a Navy spokeswoman, said the Navy is prohibited at this time from releasing the names of the accused as well as their civilian lawyers. The service members are not in confinement, Baker said.\n\nThe two Marines are listed as being part of Special Operations Command. The SEALs belong to the Navy Special Warfare Development Group. The unit is better known as SEAL Team 6, which participated in the May 2011 raid that killed al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden at his compound.\n\nThe two SEALs are based in Virginia Beach. A preliminary hearing to review the case against all four service members is scheduled for Dec. 10 at a Navy base in nearby Norfolk. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service conducted the investigation.\n\nU.S. Navy Captain Jason Salata, a spokesman for U.S. Special Operations Command, said Thursday that \"we honor the memory of Staff Sgt.

The fantasyland store it opened on Fifth Avenue in 1986 was a tourist attraction, replete with its own theme song, doormen who looked like palace guards and a musical clock tower.\n\nFinancial problems at the parent company and rising rents closed that store in 2015, but FAO is now pulling back from the worst financial precipice since it was founded in 1862.\n\nIn recent weeks at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, workers drilled, hammered and sawed 24 hours a day to get the new store ready. Employees filled shelves with hundreds of plush animals that have long defined the brand - bears, bunnies, elephants, chicks and more. The big entrance clock tower has returned. And on the second level of the 20,000-square-foot space is a giant piano keyboard mat like the one on which Tom Hanks danced to \"Heart and Soul\" in the 1988 film \"Big.\"\n\nThe 20-foot-long instrument with 60 keys is reflected on the ceiling for people in the plaza below to see. Replicas for sale cost $128.\n\nThere is also a toy grocery store where children can shop among artificial produce, complete with small carts, a checkout counter and kitchen supplies. For $75, another interactive station allows kids to adopt baby dolls, while a \"nurse\" gives lessons on how to care for them. Live magic shows will be staged nearby, next to a spot for assembling custom remote-control cars. A 27-foot-tall rocket ship teems with stuffed bear astronauts.\n\n\"We are about experiences. That's what's different from other toy stores,\" said David Niggli, FAO's chief merchandising officer.\n\nIn a global marketing push, pop-up FAO shops are also opening for the holidays in England, Spain and Australia. A March rollout is planned for a permanent store at a mall in Beijing in addition to smaller retail locations in airports and elsewhere across the U.S. and Canada.\n\nFAO Schwarz has gone through multiple corporate takeovers in recent years as retailers struggled to adapt to online sales. It was purchased in 2002 by Right Start Inc., which filed for bankruptcy twice. Toys \"R'' Us was the next owner. It sold the FAO name to the California-based ThreeSixty Brands in 2016 before recently declaring bankruptcy itself.\n\nFAO was founded in 1862 by German immigrant Frederick August Otto Schwarz, specializing in high-end toys, some imported from Europe. By the 20th century, in stores across the country, fancy items included a $1,500 jeweled Etch-A-Sketch and a Barbie-themed, hot pink foosball table for $25,000.\n\nThere are a few extravagant items to be had in the new store but plenty of modestly priced items, too.\n\n\"We have beautiful artisan pieces here, like rocking horses, but we also have items that are $10,\" Niggli said. \"There's always going to be some of those over-the-top items. I think that's part of what you come to FAO to see. It's part of the magic.\"\n\nThe most luxurious item on sale could be a child-size, drivable Mercedes Benz encrusted with 44,000 Swarovski crystals. Base price: $25,000.\n\n\"That's the core of FAO.

Still, any mention of weapons testing could influence the direction of stalled diplomatic efforts spearheaded by Washington and aimed at ridding the North of its nuclear weapons.\n\nThe North hasn't publicly tested any weapons since November 2017, but in recent days Pyongyang reportedly expressed anger at U.S.-led international sanctions and ongoing small-scale military drills between South Korea and the United States.\n\nEarlier this month, North Korea's Foreign Ministry warned it could bring back its policy of bolstering its nuclear arsenal if it doesn't receive sanctions relief.\n\n\"It's North Korea-style coercive diplomacy. North Korea is saying 'If you don't listen to us, you will face political burdens,'\" said analyst Shin Beomchul of Seoul's Asan Institute for Policy Studies.\n\nDiplomacy has stalled since a summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump in June, with Washington pushing for more action on nuclear disarmament and the North insisting that the U.S. first approve a peace declaration formally ending the Korean War and lift sanctions.\n\nShin said the weapon North Korea tested could be a missile, artillery, an anti-air gun, a drone or other high-tech conventional weapons systems.\n\nYang Wook, a Seoul-based military expert, said a \"tactical weapon\" in North Korea refers to \"a weapon aimed at striking South Korea, including U.S. military bases\" there, so the North may have tested a short-range missile or a multiple rocket launch system.\n\nEven if the test was a message for Washington and Seoul, Friday's report from the North was noticeably less belligerent than past announcements of weapons tests, and didn't focus on North Korean claims of U.S. and South Korean hostility.\n\nYang said the latest North Korean test won't completely break down nuclear diplomacy, though more questions would be raised about how sincere the North is about its commitment to denuclearization.\n\nAsked about the test, the U.S. State Department said that American and North Korean officials are talking about implementing the commitments that Trump and Kim made during their June meeting in Singapore. Eugene Lee, spokeswoman of South Korea's Unification Ministry, declined to comment on Kim's inspection of the weapons test.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence, attending a Southeast Asian summit in Singapore, cited the \"great progress\" made on North Korea but said more had to be done.\n\nA year and a half ago, \"nuclear tests were taking place, missiles were flying over Japan and there were threats and propagations against our nation and nations in the region,\" Pence said.\n\n\"Today, no more missiles are flying, no more nuclear tests, our hostages have come home, and North Korea has begun anew to return fallen American heroes from the Korean War to our soil. We made great progress but there's more work to be done,\" he said.\n\nPence stressed that U.N. sanctions had to remain enforced.\n\nIt's the first publicly known field inspection of a weapons test by Kim Jong Un since he observed the testing of the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile in November of last year, according to South Korea's Unification Ministry.\n\nThe North said the test took place at the Academy of National Defense Science and that Kim couldn't suppress his \"passionate joy\" at its success. He was described as \"so excited to say that another great work was done by the defense scientists and munitions industrial workers to increase the defense capability of the country.\"\n\nLast year's string of increasingly powerful weapons tests, many experts believe, put the North on the brink of a viable arsenal of nuclear-tipped missiles that can target anywhere in the mainland United States.\n\nTrump and Kim are both interested in another summit, but it's unclear when it might happen.

Last year, American university student Otto Warmbier died days after he was released in a coma from North Korea after 17 months in captivity.\n\nOn Friday, the Korean Central News Agency said American national Bruce Byron Lowrance was detained on Oct. 16 for illegally entering the country from China. It said he told investigators that he was under the \"manipulation\" of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. It was not clear if the North's spelling of the man's name was correct, and past reports from Pyongyang have contained incorrect spellings.\n\nA short KCNA dispatch said North Korea decided to deport him but did not say why and when.\n\nThe North's decision matches its general push for engagement and diplomacy with the United States this year after a string of weapons tests in 2017, and a furious U.S. response, had some fearing war on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nIn May, North Korea released three American detainees in a goodwill gesture weeks ahead of leader Kim Jong Un's June 12 summit with President Donald Trump in Singapore. The three Americans returned home on a flight with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Weeks after the summit, North Korea returned the remains of dozens of presumed U.S. soldiers killed during the 1950-53 Korean War.\n\nThe United States, South Korea and others have previously accused North Korea of using foreign detainees to wrest diplomatic concessions.\n\nSome foreigners have said after their release that their declarations of guilt had been coerced while in North Korean custody. Warmbier and other previous American detainees in the North were imprisoned over a variety of alleged crimes, including subversion, anti-state activities and spying.\n\nThe latest detained American is likely a man that South Korea deported last year, according to South Korean police.\n\nIn November 2017, a 58-year-old man from Louisiana was caught in South Korea after spending two nights in the woods in a civilian-restricted area near the border with North Korea. The name written in his passport was Lowrance Bruce Byron, said police officers at Gyeonggi Bukbu Provincial Police Agency.\n\nBefore his deportation, the man told interrogators that he \"knows lots of people in the Trump administration so that he wants to work as a bridge between the United States and North Korea to help improve their ties worsened by Warmbier's death,\" said one of the police officers who investigated the man. He requested anonymity citing department rules.\n\nEarlier Friday, KCNA said Kim observed the successful test of an unspecified \"newly developed ultramodern tactical weapon,\" though it didn't describe what the weapon was.\n\nIt didn't appear to be a test of a nuclear device or a long-range missile with the potential to target the United States. A string of such tests last year pushed always uncomfortable ties on the peninsula to unusually high tension before the North turned to engagement and diplomacy.\n\nStill, any mention of weapons testing could influence the direction of stalled diplomatic efforts spearheaded by Washington and aimed at ridding the North of its nuclear weapons.\n\nExperts say the weapon test was likely an expression of anger by North Korea at U.S.-led international sanctions and ongoing small-scale military drills between South Korea and the United States. It's the first publicly known field inspection of a weapons test by Kim since he observed the testing of the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile in November of last year, according to South Korea's Unification Ministry.\n\n\"It's North Korea-style coercive diplomacy. North Korea is saying 'If you don't listen to us, you will face political burdens,'\" said analyst Shin Beomchul of Seoul's Asan Institute for Policy Studies.\n\nEarlier this month, North Korea's Foreign Ministry warned it could bring back its policy of bolstering its nuclear arsenal if it doesn't receive sanctions relief.\n\nShin said the weapon North Korea tested could be a missile, artillery, an anti-air gun, a drone or other high-tech conventional weapons systems. Yang Wook, a Seoul-based military expert, said a \"tactical weapon\" in North Korea refers to \"a weapon aimed at striking South Korea including U.S. military bases\" there, so the North may have tested a short-range missile or a multiple rocket launch system.\n\nDiplomacy has stalled since the Singapore summit, with Washington pushing for more action on nuclear disarmament and the North insisting that the U.S. first approve a peace declaration formally ending the Korean War and lift sanctions.\n\nBut Friday's report from the North was noticeably less belligerent than past announcements of weapons tests, and didn't focus on North Korean claims of U.S. and South Korean hostility. Yang said the latest North Korean test won't completely break down nuclear diplomacy, though more questions would be raised about how sincere the North is about its commitment to denuclearization.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence, attending a Southeast Asian summit in Singapore, cited the \"great progress\" made on North Korea but said more had to be done.\n\nA year and a half ago, \"nuclear tests were taking place, missiles were flying over Japan and there were threats and propagations against our nation and nations in the region,\" Pence said. \"Today, no more missiles are flying, no more nuclear tests, our hostages have come home, and North Korea has begun anew to return fallen American heroes from the Korean War to our soil. We made great progress but there's more work to be done.\"\n\nPence stressed that U.N. sanctions had to remain enforced.\n\nThe North said the test took place at the Academy of National Defense Science and that Kim couldn't suppress his \"passionate joy\" at its success. He was described as \"so excited to say that another great work was done by the defense scientists and munitions industrial workers to increase the defense capability of the country.\"\n\nLast year's string of increasingly powerful weapons tests, many experts believe, put the North on the brink of a viable arsenal of nuclear-tipped missiles that can target anywhere in the mainland United States."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS This Morning", "title": "Sheryl Sandberg: \u201cWe absolutely did not pay anyone to create fake news\u201d", "description": "Facebook COO refutes claims made against her in a scathing New York Times report", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sheryl-sandberg-facebook-coo-we-absolutely-did-not-pay-anyone-to-create-fake-news/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/12/04/473066d4-5d68-41d5-8c04-c7560b85d63c/thumbnail/1200x630g2/ddc3ecf3c78c0ec2faf163807afffcc6/gettyimages-495548156.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T05:22:14Z", "content": "A day after a searing investigation into Facebook by The New York Times, the company's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, is defending herself and the social media giant.

The campaign was reportedly orchestrated by the consulting firm Definers Public Affairs, a Republican opposition research group hired by Facebook.\n\n\"We absolutely did not pay anyone to create fake news \u2013 that they have assured me was not happening. And again, we're doing a thorough look into what happened but they have assured me that we were not paying anyone to either write or promote anything that was false. And that's very important,\" Sandberg said.\n\nThe Times also reported that the firm tried to tie critics of Facebook to George Soros, the billionaire investor and philanthropist \u2013 and frequent target of conservative anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.\n\nSandberg said the firm was hired by \"the communications team\" and that she only learned about its work from the paper.\n\nThe Times report was published with the headline, \"Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook's leaders fought through crisis.\" And it was unsparing in its criticism of Sandberg and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nAmong the claims: Facebook attempted to downplay the significance of Russian activity in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. The Times said Sandberg tried to rein in Facebook's then-security chief, Alex Stamos, who had been looking into Russian activity on the network. The Times noted that one white paper Facebook released, based on an internal investigation by Stamos, did not include the word Russia. A later blog post by Facebook also downplayed Russia's role.\n\nIn the interview Thursday, Sandberg stressed Facebook's new efforts at security. \"Our strategy was to shore up the security on Facebook and make major investments there,\" Sandberg told O'Donnell. \"It was not what I was doing nor was it the company's strategy to deflect, to deny or to hire PR firms to do things. That's not the strategy. And I was part of none of that. We've taken great steps, we've made huge investments. We've invested a ton in AI and technology and if you were following us before the election you saw those efforts pay off. We were able to take down lots of stuff over and over, over and over because we were now focused on this.\"\n\nSandberg says she has the confidence of Zuckerberg. When asked if she has the confidence of the rank-and-file employees? \"Yes, I believe so.\"\n\nThe following is the extended Q&A with O'Donnell and Sandberg. It has been lightly edited for clarity:\n\nNORAH O'DONNELL, \"CBS THIS MORNING\" CO-HOST: The New York Times published an article this week which said you and Mark Zuckerberg \"Ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from the public view.\" Is that a fair characterization?\n\nSHERYL SANDBERG, FACEBOOK CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER: No. So we've said before that on spotting Russian interference that happened in the 2016 election we were too slow. We were focused on traditional attacks from Russia, you know, think hacking, malware.\n\nWe saw that and we took it down and reported it to law enforcement. But we didn't see this kind of new, insidious attack, which was very different than anyone had seen before, which was using disinformation to spread dissent in society. And as we've said before, you know, that's on us. We've taken enormous steps to become experts in fighting this and now you can see us actively pulling it down. But suggesting that we weren't interested in knowing the truth -- or that once we understood it and we didn't go after it aggressively is completely not true.\n\nO'DONNELL: You're often referred to as Facebook's \"adult in the room.\" But this article, it paints you as \"unaware\" of what was happening in the company. Do you feel the need to defend your reputation?\n\nSANDBERG: I feel the need to do this job and help lead Facebook through the period we're in. We missed some really important things and I don't think we invested enough in safety and security. If you're going to have a platform that billions of people use, you're going to see all the ugliness and all the beauty and I think we were not focused enough on preventing some of the bad things that can be happen on Facebook. I feel a tremendous responsibility to get us focused on that and make sure that we're building both the defenses we need to have and the products we need to have.\n\nO'DONNELL: What the New York Times is reporting is that some of those defenses include what are essentially efforts to deny, deflect and minimize these problems. that when these problems came to the forefront, that you organized a strategy \u2013 not to fix the problem \u2013 but to deny, deflect and minimize them in practices that are being criticized.\n\nSANDBERG: That's absolutely not true and there's just an enormous number of things in that article - that's not true. I never told Alex Stamos it was a legal problem to investigate. Ever. I never told him not to investigate. He has tweeted on that multiple times, including today. I was not part of the discussions on the white paper. I did not make the decision not to put Russia in the thing but in a footnote, but they did put it in the footnote in the end and talk about it broadly. I did not know about or hire Definers or any firm. And, our core strategy has been to find the problems, make sure we are investing in prevention and make sure we are fixing the mistakes that we made. I can talk on and on about our core strategy.\n\nThe article saying that I was spending time hiding, deflecting or hiring PR firms to do other things. That's just all not true. I wasn't involved in any of that and I don't think that was the core strategy at all. Our core strategy has been to shore up the defenses to the company and invest in security.\n\nSo on the elections, we were way behind in 2016 and we didn't see this threat coming. But now we've taken great steps, we've made huge investments, we have 10,000 people in security.\n\nWe've invested a ton in AI and technology and if you were following us before the election, you saw those efforts pay off. We were able to take down lots of stuff over and over, over and over because we were now focused on this. When you think about fake news on Facebook, we've invested in third party relationships, the ability to downrank. The ability to do related articles. When you look at fake accounts, all of the Russian interference we failed to see in 2016 was coming from fake accounts. We've made huge investments in taking down fake accounts.\n\nOur strategy was to shore up the security on Facebook and make major investments there. It was not what I was doing nor was it the company's strategy to deflect, to deny or to hire PR firms to do things. That's not the strategy. And I was part of none of that.\n\nO'DONNELL: So who hired Definers Public Affairs?\n\nSANDBERG: We're still looking into what happened. Definers was hired, we have lots of firms. They were hired not to smear anyone. Not to get any articles written or do anything false. I learned of that in the paper yesterday as well when Mark did. And they're gone and we're looking into what happened there. I don't have full details. But I will say that if there was anything that you know inadvertently or advertently played into any anti-Semitic attacks on anyone that's a problem. And I have a lot of respect for George Soros. So I'm looking into it.\n\nO'DONNELL: Well George Soros is now calling for Facebook to have an independent investigation. Will you do that?\n\nSANDBERG: Well I'm looking into what happened. The form of that investigation I don't know but I am aggressively looking into what happened.\n\nO'DONNELL: But George Soros is calling for an independent investigation. Is Facebook considering that?\n\nSANDBERG: Right. We're thinking through what that would look like.\n\nO'DONNELL: But that's the charge, Sheryl, is that every time you're presented with a problem and people ask for transparency or an independent investigation Facebook deflects and says, \"Well, we'll look into it,\" that the company is not transparent.\n\nSANDBERG: Well, I don't think that's true. We just released an independent investigation that we had commissioned on Myanmar last week. We have an election commission coming out. We announced today that we're going to have an independent board looking at appeals for content review. We're in the middle of a civil rights audit. We actually have, in progress, many of the things people have asked us to do. That was a big thing. People asked us for an independent investigation. We got the independent investigation done and we released it last week so I don't think it's fair to say we don't do that. I think we've taken major steps with transparency and that's really important.\n\nO'DONNELL: Shouldn't the Chief Operating Officer know if the company was hiring an opposition research firm?\n\nSANDBERG: I certainly wish if this was going on, that I had known about it. It is a big company with a lot of employees. We use a lot of firms. We're actually looking very carefully at all the firms we use now as part of this. I certainly wish I had.\n\nO'DONNELL: What are you doing to make sure that you aren't employing another type of Definers-type firm?\n\nSANDBERG: Looking at, looking at all the firms we use and what they do and what we hired them for\n\nO'DONNELL: If you didn't hire Definers and didn't know what they were doing on behalf of Facebook, who did?\n\nSANDBERG: The communications team.\n\nO'DONNELL: Who leads the communications team?\n\nSANDBERG: Norah, here's the thing: We take performance really seriously. We move people out of the company, we move people into the company, we change jobs, we actually are quite rigorous on this. What we haven't done and we're not gonna do is Mark and I are not gonna hold up other people out and say that person is a problem and they're gone because we think we should hold ourselves accountable and that's not the way to run a company and not the way to lead. But, you should know that we take this seriously and we do make employee movements. Strong ones.\n\nO'DONNELL: How can we trust Facebook to police fake news when it paid a company millions of dollars to create \"fake news?\" That's what Definers was doing.\n\nSANDBERG: We absolutely did not pay anyone to create fake news - THAT they have assured me was not happening. And again, we're doing a thorough look into what happened but they have assured me that we were not paying anyone to either write or promote anything that was false. And that's very important.\n\nO'DONNELL: Was it spin?\n\nSANDBERG: I don't have full details and they are gone.\n\nO'DONNELL: I don't have to remind you about Burson-Marsteller in 2011 when you hired them to get misleading and negative stories about Google into mainstream media outlets, and then apologized when you were caught. Did you learn anything from that episode?\n\nSANDBERG: I think we should have learned to be more careful in the agencies we use. We're a big company, we're using a lot of agencies and we're taking a very, very careful look.\n\nO'DONNELL: A group of senators Thursday asked the justice department to expand their ongoing investigations into Facebook to include claims that the company retaliated against critics. Will you cooperate in that investigation?\n\nSANDBERG: I mean I don't know what that investigation is but we cooperate fully in any investigation from the government. From any government. We've had many. We will always cooperate. We'll always cooperate fully.\n\nO'DONNELL: Do you believe that you have the confidence of Mark Zuckerberg?\n\nSANDBERG: Yes\n\nO'DONNELL: And do you think you have the confidence of the rank-and-file employees at Facebook?\n\nSANDBERG: Yes, I believe so. Certainly from what I saw today. Here's what I would say, Norah, is that the allegations in this piece are very serious and absolutely false.\n\nWe miss things. I miss things. Mark has said he missed things. We missed really important things. We were not fast enough to deal with hate speech. We missed foreign interference in the 2016 election. We were focused on a different kind of interference that was more traditional.\n\nWe missed this. And we had some issues with privacy along with Cambridge Analytica and some of the development platforms we had. We are making major investments that we should have made earlier to fix those issues and the reason I think we can do it is because we built the company, we care the most. We know how this works and we know what we need to do to make sure we get to a place where we are protecting safety and security.\n\nAll of these issues are never going away, ever. We are always going to have someone trying to use our services in bad ways. But it is on us. On me. On us to figure out what those are, we get ahead of them and even anticipate them. And we are making those investments.\n\nAnd I have a really important job, it's a job I love and a job I'm honored to do and I think a really deep responsibility to Mark and to the company to help get us into a better place. I think if you look at the track record from the 2016 election to this one you see, the work is never done. But you see major improvements. We didn't know about foreign interference in 2016 but now we know. We are systematically finding it. We're working closely with government, we are systematically finding foreign interference from Iran, reportedly from Russia, from spammers and we are systematically taking it down, notifying and working with law enforcement, working with other companies. And we're doing it. Not just for the U.S. election but for elections around the world.\n\nAnd so, we have a lot of hard work to do and I have a lot of hard work to do but it's work I take super seriously and really believe in and want to do because I think at the end of the day, so much good happens on Facebook and we have to protect against the bad and do much more there and that's what we're doing. And I hope, over time, that we will be judged by the actions we've taken and the progress we're making. And I think we're making very substantial progress.\n\nI also want to acknowledge, Norah, that trust takes a long time to rebuild. We know we have a long road ahead and we don't expect it to happen overnight and we don't expect an easy fix but we know we have a long road over head and we are absolutely committed.\n\nO'DONNELL: I just want to make sure I'm clear about this, because I think that the reason that there was such a response to this article is the suggestion that Facebook itself is involved in information warfare against its critics...\n\nSANDBERG: Correct.\n\nO'DONNELL: ...and that you have led that effort, because you are focused on protecting your reputation rather than the future of the company.\n\nSANDBERG: Right, so let me address all of that. I have not led that effort. That is not the strategy. That is not what we are doing. Our strategy is to find the issues, invest in security, shore up security on Facebook, and make everyone stay safe in our community. Full stop.\n\nThat is not the strategy. I have spent zero time doing that. Zero. Because that's not what we're doing.\n\nO'DONNELL: So if you've not led that effort, who has?\n\nSANDBERG: I mean, never paid for anyone to do anything that was wrong.\n\nO'DONNELL: Do you really want to say that?\n\nSANDBERG: No, everything there was false. I never paid for fake news, we're looking into what Definers did.\n\nO'DONNELL: Personally - how does it make you feel, having these charges leveled against you today?\n\nSANDBERG: I mean, of course it's hard, but I don't think that's the point. I have a big responsibility here, I have a big responsibility for the challenges we're dealing with. And we're dealing with unbelievably challenging issues that have taken place on a new scale. And it matters, because this impacts people's lives, it impacts elections, and so my job is to make sure we're making the best possible investments we can, and making the investments we need to make sure we can prevent abuse as much as possible."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Winter storm wallops eastern U.S.", "description": "Winter came early this year when a storm slammed the eastern United States.

Bill Nelson, as well as the agriculture commissioner race moved on to another recount Thursday.\n\nBut Nelson's path to victory narrowed significantly Friday morning when Judge Mark Walker ruled that guidelines provided by Florida law to election canvassing boards as to how to determine voter intent in a manual recount are constitutional. Walker also denied a request for Scott to recuse himself from election matters.\n\nHere's a rundown on the latest developments.\n\nMachine recount completed\n\nFlorida's deadline for the machine recount was 3 p.m. Thursday, and while most of the 67 counties finished and submitted the new results in time, Broward County missed the deadline by two minutes, submitting its machine recount at 3:02 p.m. The state rejected Broward's submission.\n\n\"Since Broward did not meet the deadline required by law, the first unofficial returns take the place of the second unofficial returns,\" the Department of State said in a statement Thursday. Now, the initial results submitted on Saturday will be considered instead.\n\n\n\nBroward Election Supervisor Brenda Snipes has faced sharp criticism for her handling of the midterm elections. Among other reasons, Broward's votes were counted more slowly than the majority of the other counties in the state. People on social media have been harassing Snipes, posted Snipes' home address and phone number sites including Facebook.\n\nPalm Beach County also failed to make the 3 p.m. deadline and submitted its original results instead. Its tallying machines overheated, causing mismatched results with the recount of 174,000 early voting ballots and forcing staffers to redo their work.\n\nHillsborough County, too, chose to submit its original results, rather than its machine recount. Craig Latimer, the elections supervisor for Hillsborough, said the county's recount came up with 846 fewer votes than the first count, according to the Tampa Bay Times .\n\n\"We are not willing to accept that votes go unreported,\" Latimer said, in explaining why the county submitted its original count to the Department of State.\n\nVoting irregularity claims\n\nThe Florida secretary of state alleges voting irregularities occurred in four counties, including Broward. The Florida Department of State on Friday asked U.S. attorneys to investigate the irregularities, attaching an example that appeared to show a Florida Democratic Party volunteer advising a mail-in voter to deliver a voter affadavit by 5 p.m. on Thursday, Nov. 8, two days after the election. However, that information was incorrect, since the affadavits were due on the day before the election, on Nov. 5.\n\nFour county supervisors turned over information that showed Democratic Party operatives changed official forms to say that voters had until two days after the election to fix any problems with mail-in ballot signatures. Under current law, a voter has until the day before Election Day to fix a problem.\n\nThe legal battles\n\nWalker ruled Thursday that voters whose mail-in or provisional ballots were rejected because the signatures didn't match those on file will now have until Saturday at 5 p.m. to fix their ballots. Soon after the ruling, Scott appealed it.\n\nIn granting the preliminary injunction, Walker wrote that the issue \"is whether Florida's law that allows county election officials to reject vote-by-mail and provisional ballots for mismatched signatures\u2014with no standards, an illusory process to cure, and no process to challenge the rejection\u2014 passes constitutional muster. The answer is simple. It does not.\"\n\nDemocrats and Nelson argued that rejecting the ballots without standards for fixing them violates the Constitution's equal protection clause. They wanted all the voided ballots to be counted, a proposal rejected by Walker.\n\nThe state of Florida argued that Nelson had waited too long to file the suit and that delaying the results would cause irreparable harm.\n\nState officials said the matching requirement led to the voiding of nearly 4,000 ballots, although that figure did not include larger counties such as Miami-Dade, and it is smaller than the margin of about 13,000 votes separating Scott and Nelson. That's a margin of 0.15 percent. Should that margin hold, there will be a hand recount, and the deadline for that is currently Sunday. It is not clear how or whether the court's extension will affect Thursday's deadline for the machine recount.\n\nWalker ruled on Thursday afternoon in another case denying a request by the Nelson campaign to extend the machine recount deadline for all 67 counties in Florida.\n\nWhere it goes from here\n\nGillum is still calling for every legal vote to be counted by the state. \"As today's unofficial reports and recent court proceedings make clear, there are tens of thousands of votes that have yet to be counted,\" he said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"We plan to do all we can to ensure that every voice is heard in this process. Voters need to know that their decision to participate in this election, and every election, matters. It is not over until every legally casted vote is counted.\"\n\nScott agreed to step down from the state panel responsible for certifying the final results. Scott has also suggested fraud may be taking place in some counties. Critics have said Scott should have no role in overseeing the election given his close contest.\n\nThe League of Women Voters of Florida and another group had filed a lawsuit that sought to remove Scott from any official control over the election. Scott appoints the state's chief election official responsible for ordering recounts. Ballots, however, are counted by local election officials.\n\nNo less than six federal lawsuits have been filed so far in Tallahassee. Nelson's campaign has also filed a lawsuit seeking public records from a north Florida elections supervisor who allowed voters in GOP-heavy Bay County to email their ballots in apparent violation of state law.\n\nJudge Walker, citing a well-known \"Star Trek\" episode about rapidly-reproducing furry aliens, said during one election lawsuit hearing Wednesday that \"I feel a little bit like Captain Kirk in the episode with the Tribbles where they start to multiply.\" He began his third hearing of the day by correcting himself: \"The lawyers are multiplying like Tribbles - not the lawsuits.\"\n\nScott was in Washington, D.C., while the court battles rage on. He stood at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's left shoulder Wednesday when the Kentucky Republican welcomed GOP senators who will take their seats in January when the new Congress is sworn in.\n\nJack Turman and Grace Segers contributed reporting"}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "11/15/18: CBSN Evening News", "description": "Winter storm slams Midwest and Northeast; Bhutanese conjoined twins \"still want to be close\" to each other one week after separation surgery.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/111518-cbsn-evening-news/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/16/b525998e-c8b1-4748-87e5-fdbf0abddd80/thumbnail/1200x630/5481c7ec95ce6bc39dfcb45ebb0702ca/1115-cbsn-full-1713569-640x360.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T04:04:46Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "11/15/18: Red and Blue", "description": "President Trump: The White House is running very smoothly; Ohio governor and 2016 candidate takes another trip to New Hampshire.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/111518-red-and-blue/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/16/e58e3fa6-eefd-4889-ba21-6a472d680086/thumbnail/1200x630/97be3059178b8dabf6adec0f96d81b82/1115-rnb-full-1713566-640x360.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T04:01:37Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Ranked-choice voting used in Maine as Democrats clinch another U.S. House seat", "description": "Democrats picked up another seat in the House Thursday, after Jared Golden defeated incumbent Republican Congressman Bruce Poliquin.

Among his famous \"pool paintings,\" ''Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\" is considered one of his premier works. The previous record by a living artist was set by Jeff Koons' \"Balloon Dog,\" which sold for $58.4 million in 2013.\n\n\"CBS This Morning Saturday\" co-host Anthony Mason got a chance to look at the Hockney masterpiece up close before it hit the auction block at Christie's.\n\nIn an interview at his Los Angeles studio two years ago, Hockney told Mason he doesn't know why it's been so popular over the years, and aptly pointed out, \"If there were a formula for that, there'd be a lot more of them, wouldn't there.\"\n\nHockney said he was drawn to California by the sunshine, far from his hometown of Bradford, England, which he described as having a \"gothic gloom.\" California is where he found his sense of color and where he developed a fascination with pools.\n\n\"It's always an interesting thing. How do you paint water? How do you paint something transparent?\" Hockney said.\n\nAnthony Wallace / AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe 1972 painting by Hockney, now 81, is \"the holy grail of his paintings, from both the historical and the market perspectives,\" Alex Rotter, co-chairman of post-war and contemporary art at Christie's, said in September. He noted that it reflects both the European and the American perspectives of an artist who came to live in sunny California in the '60s, and saw himself as living on both continents.\n\n\"It has all the elements that you would want in a Hockney painting,\" Rotter said in an interview. He noted that writers have referred to the swimming pool as being sort of a self-portrait of Hockney, though he never confirmed that, just saying he was fascinated to paint moving water.\n\nThe painting, whose buyer was not immediately revealed, had been long held by a private collector.\n\nA depiction of two men - one swimming the breaststroke underwater, the other standing by the pool looking down - the painting was originally inspired, according to background provided by Christie's, by two photographs Hockney found juxtaposed on his studio floor, one of a swimmer in Hollywood in 1966, and another of a boy staring at something on the ground.\n\nThe rocky landscape is in southern France, and the standing figure is said to represent Peter Schlesinger, whom the artist met in 1966, when the younger man was a student in one of Hockney's art classes at UCLA. For the next five years, according to Christie's, he was both \"the great love of Hockney's life\" and one of his favorite models.\n\nThe relationship ended in 1971. Hockney had already begun the painting and he abandoned it, starting again the following year."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Kroger shooting suspect faces federal hate crime charges", "description": "A federal grand jury in Kentucky has charged a white man with three hate crimes in the shooting deaths of two African Americans last month at a grocery store.
