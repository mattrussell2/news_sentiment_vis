Those who employed these tactics to save money were far more likely to overspend during the holidays than those who didn't, according to a new report.\n\nA survey of more than 1,000 consumers found that less than one-third who didn't bother with coupons overspent, but more than 40 percent who did use coupons spent more than they planned on holiday shopping, according to Elevate's Center for the New Middle Class, which sponsored the study.\n\nThe results were nearly identical when it came to shopping for sales. Consumers who said they waited for sales promotions to control their holiday spending were 50 percent more likely to say they overspent than those who didn't.\n\n\"Realize that retailers have done this for a long time, and they may know something about how to open our wallets,\" said Jonathan Walker, executive director of the Center for the New Middle Class. \"There is something about the feeling that we've saved money that gives us license to spend more.\"\n\nTwo groups of spenders\n\n\n\nNotably, planned expenses are pretty high for the holidays even before consumers engage in budget-busting. The study broke consumers into two groups based on their credit scores -- \"prime\" consumers with credit scores over 700, and everyone else. It then asked how much individuals planned to spend during the holiday season. Those who put themselves on strict spending budgets and could thus predict their spending said they'd budgeted between $658 and $1,182.\n\nBut when all respondents were asked to break out how much they actually did spend last year on gifts, travel, parties, meals, charity and decorations, the numbers were far different. The \"prime\" consumers, who have credit scores above 700, said they actually spent a whopping $1,702, including $770 on gifts and $435 on holiday travel. The \"nonprime\" consumers spent considerably less, but still a healthy $988 on average. Roughly one-third of all consumers spent more than they had planned.\n\nPart of the problem may be that people forget the myriad of extraordinary costs that crop up during the season, from travel to additional charitable gifts, Walker said. This may be why the survey found that people who made gifts by hand and budgeted for each gift purchase weren't effective in stopping overspending. He suspects they forgot that only about 60 percent of holiday costs are for gifts. Decorations, travel and parties need to be accounted for, too.\n\nHowever, holiday overspending wasn't the only Yuletide budget-buster. More than half of survey respondents said some unusual expense -- a car or appliance repair, a medical problem or veterinary bill, an unexpected high utility bill -- hit them from out of the blue last holiday season.\n\n\"Car problems don't take two months off just because you're buying gifts,\" Walker said. \"You've got to have some money in reserve for the things that you wouldn't expect.\"\n\nHave a budget, and stick to it\n\n\n\nThe result of budget-busting was a big boost in average post-holiday debt for about one-third of the nonprime consumers and for roughly 20 percent of the prime group.\n\nThe one bright note: Individuals who put themselves on a strict overall budget were far less likely to overspend. Only about one-quarter of the nonprime and 30 percent of the prime consumers who had budgeted spent more than they planned. The budgeters were also more likely to say they ended up better off financially after the holidays than they were before, Walker said.\n\n\"We were trying to see what techniques people employed to avoid overspending and whether they worked,\" he said. \"Having a strict budget was the only effective method.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Grace Segers", "title": "Michael Avenatti arrested for domestic violence", "description": "Stormy Daniels' attorney and prominent Trump critic Michael Avenatti has been arrested for an incident involving his estranged wife", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-avenatti-arrested-for-domestic-violence/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/07/05/cb27c681-57c9-4633-8056-08c24afab6cf/thumbnail/1200x630g2/6aedf9d63ec866b1e07a6f57029d5a66/ap-18150582851545.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T23:11:22Z", "content": "Michael Avenatti, the attorney for Stormy Daniels and a prominent Trump critic, has been arrested for domestic violence, according to a law enforcement source.

The \"backstop\" plan involves keeping the U.K. in a customs union with the EU until a permanent trade treaty is worked out.\n\nIt's a breakthrough, but the path to Brexit day -- just over four months away on March 29 -- remains rocky. May still faces pitfalls and threats from her domestic opponents as she tries to navigate the U.K.'s orderly exit from the EU.\n\nThe prime minister hailed the Cabinet decision as a \"decisive step\" toward finalizing the exit deal with the EU within days. It sets in motion an elaborate diplomatic choreography of statements and meetings.\n\nMany in the divided Conservative Party believe May's proposal leaves Europe with too much control over Britain's trade and borders, certainly if the U.K. remains for any considerable period part of the bloc's customs union. More philosophically, and perhaps more important from a public perspective, they argue that such a deal would betray the British public's will after the majority vote to leave the EU.\n\nMay insists her proposal delivers on key promises to reduce Europe's checks on British trade and immigration. \"We will deliver Brexit. We will not rerun the referendum,\" she vowed on the floor of the British Parliament on Wednesday.\n\n\"I firmly believe, with my head and my heart, that this is a decision which is in the best interests of the United Kingdom,\" she said. And in a warning to her opponents, May added that the choice was between her deal, \"or leave with no deal; or no Brexit at all.\"\n\nThe draft divorce agreement between Britain and the European Union has two parts: a legally binding withdrawal agreement, which runs more than 580 pages, and a looser political declaration on future relations.\n\nHere are some key points in the deal May got her government to agree to:\n\nWithdrawal agreement\n\nTransition period: Britain will leave the EU on March 29 but remain inside the bloc's single market and be bound by its rules until the end of December 2020, while the two sides work out a new trade relationship. The transition period can be extended by joint agreement before July 1, 2020 if both parties decide more time is needed.\n\nIrish border: The deal commits the two sides to a \"backstop\" solution to guarantee the border between EU member Ireland and the U.K.'s Northern Ireland remains free of customs posts or other obstacles. It keeps the U.K. in a customs arrangement with the EU, and it will last until superseded by permanent new trade arrangements. Both sides said they hope to have a new deal in place by the end of 2020, so the backstop is never needed.\n\nDivorce bill: Britain agrees to cover contributions to staff pensions and commitments to EU programs the U.K. made while a member for the funding period that runs to 2020. The bill has previously been estimated at about 39 billion pounds ($50 billion).\n\nCitizens' rights: EU citizens living in Britain, and Britons elsewhere in the bloc, will continue to have the rights to live and work that they have now.\n\nPolitical declaration\n\nThe seven-page political declaration says Britain and the EU will seek a \"free trade area combining deep regulatory and customs cooperation,\" and \"ambitious, comprehensive and balanced\" arrangements for the services sector.\n\nOther ambitions include visa-free travel for short-term visits, smooth railroad, air and sea transport, and \"comprehensive, close, balanced and reciprocal law enforcement and judicial cooperation.\"\n\nDetails will be worked out after the U.K. leaves the EU on March 29.\n\nHere's a look at what's likely to happen next:\n\nBeeline to Brussels\n\nMay is due to update Parliament on Thursday on what has been agreed, while Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab will likely head to Brussels to meet with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier.\n\nBarnier declared there has been \"decisive progress\" toward a deal -- the phrase that allows EU leaders to call a special summit to approve the deal. They have penciled in a meeting for Nov. 25.\n\nPeril in Parliament\n\nOnce the EU has signed off on it, the deal also must be approved by the European and British parliaments\n\nMay hopes to get it passed by U.K. lawmakers before Christmas. Business groups warn that most U.K. companies will implement Brexit contingency plans -- cutting jobs, stockpiling goods, relocating production -- if there isn't clarity by then about the terms of Brexit.\n\nBut she faces an uphill battle. May's Conservative Party doesn't hold a majority of seats in the House of Commons and relies on 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to win votes. But the DUP said it will reject any deal that treats Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the U.K.\n\nSeveral dozen pro-Brexit Conservatives have vowed to oppose any arrangement that keeps Britain in a customs union and tied to EU trade rules, indefinitely.\n\nThe main opposition Labour Party also said it will oppose any deal that doesn't offer the same benefits Britain currently has as a member of the EU's single market and customs union.\n\nMay is calculating that, faced with the prospect of a chaotic \"no-deal\" exit -- complete with financial turmoil, gridlock at U.K. ports and shortages of essential goods -- most Conservatives and some opposition lawmakers will crumble and support the deal.\n\nPossibility of a party rebellion\n\nIf enough senior members of May's party balk at the deal, it could still lead to a challenge for the leadership of the party. In Britain's version of democracy, that means she could theoretically be unseated as Prime Minister and her entire government replaced through a snap election.\n\nA senior party member warned hardline Conservative \"Brexiteers\" on Wednesday, that if they fail to back May's proposal, it could backfire on them.\n\nFormer Conservative Party leader William Hague, who voted to \"Remain\" in the 2016 referendum, said the public's decision must now be respected, and warned that rejecting May's proposal in hopes of a better deal would be inherently risky: \"If you don't take this opportunity to leave the EU, to get Brexit over the line, you might never leave at all,\" he told BBC's Radio 4.\n\nUncharted territory\n\nIf Parliament rejects the deal, Britain enters unknown territory.\n\nLawmakers could try to send the government back to the negotiating table with the EU, though there's no simple mechanism to make that happen.

The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court alleges Weinstein raped de la Huerta twice in New York in December 2010, taunting her with phone calls between the two assaults.\n\nNew York police said a year ago that they were investigating de la Huerta's allegations. No charges have been filed in the case, but Weinstein is charged there with sexually assaulting two other women.\n\nIn a new allegation, the suit states that the following month Weinstein exposed himself to the actress in a Beverly Hills hotel when she went to confront him. She alleges Weinstein tried to get de la Huerta to have a sexual encounter with him and another woman.\n\nCBS News\n\nAbout a year after the incidents, de la Huerta was fired from the HBO show \"Boardwalk Empire,\" and the lawsuit states she has reason to believe Weinstein was involved. It cites a photo that appeared in The New York Times of Weinstein talking to Martin Scorsese, a director and executive producer on the show, a few weeks before her firing.\n\nPolice officials and Mayor Bill de Blasio called de la Huerta's claims \"highly credible\" last year, reports The New York Times, but she was never added to the Manhattan criminal case. Her lawyer, Aaron G. Filler, told The Times one reason was because the Manhattan District Attorney's office couldn't corroborate the date for the alleged incident in Los Angeles. Filler told the paper the lawsuit seeks to use archival photos to corroborate de la Huerta's claims and show that she and Weinstein were both at the locations where she said the assault occurred. Filler said he forwarded additional evidence to the district attorney's office Sunday.\n\nThe office declined to comment to the paper on Tuesday.\n\nWeinstein's attorney Ben Brafman, in response to the suit, pointed out the lack of charges in New York. He said in an emailed statement that de la Huerta's \"newly minted version of events including her new California claims are equally preposterous and unfortunately, the product of an unstable personality with a vivid imagination.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Scorsese, who is not a defendant in the case, had no immediate comment.\n\nDe la Huerta, 34, alleges Weinstein damaged her career by at least $60 million.\n\nAshley Judd, who is among numerous women suing Weinstein, says in her own lawsuit that Weinstein hurt her career and prevented her from getting at least one role. Judd cites an interview last year with director Peter Jackson, who said that Weinstein warned him against hiring Judd and Mira Sorvino for his \"Lord of the Rings\" films. Both women have alleged that Weinstein sexually harassed them.\n\nDe la Huerta's lawsuit alleges Weinstein first pressured her for sex in her apartment after the two had been at a party celebrating the premiere of the film \"Blue Valentine\" in 2010, and threatened to harm her career if she didn't submit, then raped her when she refused.\n\nThe lawsuit states that Weinstein taunted her with phone calls for two weeks, and on Dec. 23 she agreed to see him at her apartment with the intention of demanding that he stop the calls. She drank large amounts of alcohol in her anxiety, making her vulnerable, and Weinstein raped her again, according to the suit.\n\nThree weeks later in January 2011, the two were both in Los Angeles for series of awards-season events when de la Huerta again tried to confront Weinstein. Her lawsuit states the mogul opened the door of his room at the Four Seasons Hotel and exposed himself to her and invited her to have a sexual encounter with him and another woman who was in the room and undressed, the suit states.\n\nCBS New York\n\nDe la Huerta left feeling \"embarrassed, scared, shocked and humiliated,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nShe then drank excessively and was denied entry to a GQ party at the Chateau Marmont. Photographers captured video of the drunken actress, further damaging her reputation and career, the lawsuit states.\n\nMore than 75 women have accused Weinstein, who was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, of wrongdoing. Weinstein has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex, with his attorney challenging the credibility of his accusers.\n\nWeinstein faces criminal charges in New York over allegations that he raped an unidentified woman in his hotel room in 2013 and performed a forcible sex act on a different woman in 2006. A judge last month agreed to dismiss charges related to a third accuser, Lucia Evans, after evidence emerged that a police detective had coached a witness to stay silent about evidence that cast doubt on her account.\n\nBrafman said the detective had corruptly attempted to influence the case, affecting its integrity. But attorney Carrie Goldberg said Evans has no doubt that when Evans was an aspiring actress in 2004, Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him at his Manhattan office. Goldberg accused the district attorney's office of failing to investigate evidence and witnesses properly.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon insisted in court last month the rest of the case, involving two other accusers, was strong.\n\n\"In short, your honor, we are moving full steam ahead,\" she said.\n\nWeinstein had previously pleaded not guilty to the six sex crimes he was initially charged with.

Online searches for homes in Long Island City \u2014 long an industrial area in the Queens borough of New York \u2014 soared 248 percent last week, real estate brokerage Redfin said.\n\nSearches in the other winner of Amazon's sweepstakes, Crystal City, Virginia, jumped 84 percent. Real estate agents say they're hearing from investors who'd like to become landlords and from sellers who've decided to pull their homes off the market, sit back and wait for prices to go up, up, up.\n\nThe surge of interest has followed Amazon's selection of those two areas to each receive 25,000 new jobs paying an average of $150,000.\n\nThe two localities already reflect the ultra-pricey New York and Washington metro areas, though real estate sales there had been relatively modest of late. Worries are arising, in fact, that housing prices in both places\u2014 whether for renters or buyers \u2014 are destined to price out all but the most affluent in the coming years.\n\nThe same trend, critics note, has long been evident in such high-tech centers as San Francisco, San Jose, California, and Seattle, where Amazon is based. In those cities, low- and moderate-income families increasingly struggle to afford housing anywhere near their workplaces.\n\nOut of concern that Amazon's arrival could make homes prohibitively expensive, buyers around Crystal City are suddenly rushing to close on sales, said Brian MacMahon, a real estate agent with Redfin in Northern Virginia.\n\nEnvisioning a stream of rising rental income, investors are calling from as far as California to inquire about buying homes they could rent out or just allow to appreciate in value, MacMahon said. Two sellers have just pulled listings from the market, he said, so the homes could be re-listed next year, presumably at higher prices, after the market adjusts to Amazon's arrival.\n\n\"When we have nice stuff coming onto the market, it's flying off the shelf,\" MacMahon said.\n\nBy choosing the New York and Washington areas, Amazon has inadvertently thrown a spotlight on the gulf between a small group of thriving but high-cost U.S. cities and the rest of the country. Housing in Amazon's two new hubs are well more than twice the median home price nationwide of $255,000, according to ATTOM Data Solutions.\n\nThe median price in Arlington County has surged 12.5 percent so far this year to $585,000. In Queens County, the median has risen 7 percent to $630,000.\n\nAmazon executives were drawn to the sizable pools of well-educated and skilled workers in the two areas, which they chose over 18 other finalists with housing that has generally been less expensive. \"Home affordability was not a prime deciding factor for Amazon,\" said Daren Blomquist, senior vice president of ATTOM.\n\nIn some ways, Amazon had injected adrenaline into a New York City market where price growth had exceeded wage gains to the point that residential sales had begun to slow. Until last weekend, real estate agents say, attendance at open houses for condos in Long Island City had been sparse.\n\nThe $1.7 million condo at the Foundry building, with its private terrace and skyscraper views, was once the kind of showcase property that triggered competing bids within a few weeks. Buyers, though, had adopted a wait-and-see stance as mortgage rates rose, luxury construction flooded the market and interest from foreign buyers waned.\n\nYet over the weekend, open house attendance in Long Island City suddenly tripled as word of Amazon's announcement became public, said Christopher Austad, a real estate broker with Douglas Elliman.\n\n\"We just caught a huge breath of fresh air \u2014 it's like someone just resuscitated us,\" Austad said. \"I've had a dozen new buyers and investors reach out this week. I've had past sellers contracting me and saying, 'Chris, we want to invest in LIC.' It's great.\"\n\nIn the Seattle area, Amazon's presence, along with that of other tech giants like Microsoft, is thought to have contributed to home values that have priced out even relatively affluent families and have left poorer residents with few options. Homelessness has worsened. Over the past five years, the median home value in Seattle has rocketed 73 percent to $739,600, according to an analysis by the real estate firm Zillow, which is also based there.\n\nPartly in response, the city approved a series of increases to its minimum wage that will reach as high as $16 an hour next year. It approved a corporate tax this year to help the homeless, though the tax was repealed after being challenged by the local business community, including Amazon.\n\nAaron Terrazas, a senior economist at Zillow, said he thinks metro New York and Washington will avoid the same predicament. \"I don't think we should expect a similar jump,\" Terrazas said. \"Both New York and D.C. have demonstrated a capacity to add supply in ways that Seattle was reluctant to.\"\n\nBoth metro areas are already comfortable with building blocks of apartment and condo towers, he said. Their high-density construction makes it easier to accommodate the job growth than cities that prioritize single-family housing.\n\nThey also contain extensive mass transit networks. In theory at least, the New York and Washington subway systems can ease housing price pressures by enabling workers to spread out.\n\nStill, the benefits of mass transit depend on New York and Washington maintaining and improving their systems \u2014 a severe challenge in recent years amid breakdowns, deteriorating tracks and rising expenses in both public transportation systems.\n\nYet the underlying message from Amazon's two selections is that big tech companies seem not to view housing costs as a barrier for hiring workers. Companies in Seattle and San Francisco have increasingly expressed concern that tech talent there would migrate to Salt Lake City, Boise or other cities where homes are more affordable.\n\nAmazon appears less concerned. \"There was anxiety in Silicon Valley that there are all these up-and-coming tech hubs that would challenge them,\" Terrazas said. \"What the selection of D.C. and New York underlines is how the dominant players continue to be dominant.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Ashley Welch", "title": "Diseases spread by ticks hit record level in US - CBS News", "description": "CBS News Diseases spread by ticks hit record level in US CBS News New government research shows that tickborne diseases like Lyme disease continue to rise.

The CDC said there were 59,349 confirmed cases of tickborne diseases in 2017, up from 48,610 in 2016. In past years, health officials have acknowledged that the true number of cases is likely many times higher than the officially tally.\n\nThe findings reflect an accelerating trend of tick-related diseases reported in the U.S. Between 2004 and 2016, the number of such cases doubled. Researchers also discovered seven new tickborne pathogens that infect people.\n\nWhat's behind the increase?\n\nScientists say the reason for surge in tickborne diseases is unclear. However, a number of factors are likely at play.\n\nAfter another CDC report published earlier this year found that the number of illnesses caused by mosquito, tick, and flea bites have tripled in the United States over the last 13 years, experts noted that host populations play an important role.\n\nFor example, an increase in deer populations in residential areas can also bring an increase of deer ticks, which can lead to more people being infected with Lyme disease and other infections. This has been a growing problem in many communities as suburban development moves into formerly rural areas.\n\nScientists have also warned about the impact of climate change in spreading ticks and the diseases they carry to wider areas.\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nIn a 2017 report from the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, an organization representing 500,000 clinical practitioners aimed at taking action against climate change, Dr. Nitin Damle, president of the American College of Physicians and an internist in Wakefield, Rhode Island, said his practice has seen a significant rise in tickborne diseases, including Lyme disease and other infections, over the past five years.\n\n\"Those blacklegged ticks, the carriers of Lyme disease, thrive in warm, muggy weather. In my home state of Rhode Island, where winters have gotten warmer and shorter, these tiny, sesame seed-sized insects have more time to bite humans and spread Lyme disease. Tick season used to be relegated to summer; it now spans spring and autumn. And this isn't limited to the typical tick hotspot states,\" he said.\n\nHow to prevent tickborne diseases\n\nHealth officials warn that the United States is not fully prepared to control the rising threat of tick-related diseases. The CDC says better methods are needed to prevent tick bites and to control ticks and the diseases they spread.\n\nIn the meantime, health experts recommend the following steps to help protect yourself and your family from ticks:\n\nAvoid wooded and brushy areas with high grass and leaf litter; walk in the center of trails.\n\nUse repellents that contain 20 to 30 percent DEET on exposed skin and clothing for protection that lasts up to several hours.\n\nUse products that contain permethrin to treat clothing and gear, such as boots, pants, socks and tents.\n\nBathe or shower as soon as possible after coming indoors (preferably within two hours) to wash off and more easily find ticks that are crawling on you.\n\nConduct a full-body tick check using a hand-held or full-length mirror to view all parts of your body upon return from tick-infested areas."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Migrants seeking asylum arrive at U.S. border", "description": "About 350 Central American migrants arrived at the U.S-Mexico border on Tuesday.

Before the day was out, there was talk the utility's equipment had sparked another wildfire.\n\nSuch speculation was anything but idle. California state investigators in June faulted PG&E-owned power lines for sparking a dozen blazes in Northern California in the fall of 2017 that killed 46 and incinerated nearly 9,000 homes and other structures.\n\nPG&E's potential liability for the deaths and massive property loss in the Camp Fire is slamming the company financially. Shares of the utility plunged as much as 32 percent on Thursday and are down nearly 63 percent since Nov. 8.\n\nThat was the date PG&E notified the California Public Utilities Commission that a transmission line in Northern California's Butte County, just north of Sacramento, had failed at 6:15 a.m. Pacific time. The fire was reported at roughly 6:30 a.m.\n\nBillions in potential liabilities\n\nThe plunge in PG&E's stock price has lopped nearly $15 billion off its value as a public company and raised questions about its viability.\n\nPG&E said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it could face \"significant liability in excess of insurance coverage\" if its equipment is found to have caused the Camp Fire, while noting that the blaze remains under investigation.\n\nThe company has $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents after drawing down all of its revolving credit facility, and it has an additional $1.4 billion in wildfire insurance coverage, according to the filing. In statement to CBS MoneyWatch, PG&E said it tapped its credit facility \"to provide greater financial flexibility, including to pay down upcoming debt maturities and for general business purposes.\"\n\nInvestors estimate PG&E could be on the hook for $12 billion in liabilities, said Tim Hynes, head of North American research for Debtwire. That total exceeds the company's market capitalization of $9.7 billion.\n\nAnother Wall Street analyst pegged the estimated cost of the 2018 fire at $15 billion, noting it's still only partially contained. \"Liabilities are going to be significant,\" Citigroup analyst Praful Mehta said.\n\nAbout two dozen lawsuits have already been filed against PG&E for allegedly failing to maintain its power lines.\n\nLaw protects utilities from fire losses\n\nCalifornia lawmakers in August passed a wildfire measure that provided utilities some relief from wildfire-related liabilities. But the law, which covered damages only in 2017, was criticized as favoring companies over survivors. A new legislative session is set to begin in January, and incoming Governor Gavin Newsom has not yet weighed in on any plan to help the utility.\n\n\"The only real solution is to go back to Sacramento and get some form of recovery for 2018 damages,\" Mehta said of the newly enacted law, which doesn't address any potential financial toll from this year's infernos.\n\nThe pummeling of PG&E shares reflects that the market views the odds of a legislative fix to be low, he said.\n\nDebtwire's Hynes said the utility has enough cash to get through the next year, and he believes the state will step in to keep the company operating.\n\n\"It's the bondholders and the equity holders that will bear the costs,\" he said. \"If you're a utility customer, you're fine.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Camilo Montoya-Galvez", "title": "Missing American reporter Austin Tice is believed to be alive, says U.S. official", "description": "The Marine-turned-reporter vanished in Syria in 2012, and the U.S. is pressing Russia for help in freeing him", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/missing-american-reporter-austin-tice-is-believed-to-be-alive-says-u-s-official/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/09/10/5329a32c-b7ab-47a8-86ab-a2daef950f97/thumbnail/1200x630/304d373c450d1fa766c40e2573053014/41621396473609398582300549o.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T20:32:26Z", "content": "The U.S. government strongly believes Austin Tice, a Marine-turned-reporter who vanished in Syria in the summer of 2012, is alive and being held captive in the war-torn Middle Eastern country, according to a senior State Department official. \"I want to make i\u2026 [+3193 chars]", "fulltext": "The U.S. government strongly believes Austin Tice, a Marine-turned-reporter who vanished in Syria in the summer of 2012, is alive and being held captive in the war-torn Middle Eastern country, according to a senior State Department official.\n\n\"I want to make it very clear that the United States government believes Austin Tice is alive,\" U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Robert O'Brien told reporters on Tuesday. \"We are deeply concerned about his well-being after six years of captivity.\"\n\nIn an event hosted by the National Press Club, O'Brien said the State Department is spearheading an investigative and diplomatic multinational effort to locate the missing journalist and secure his release.

And I'm sure that's sustaining him through these incredibly trying circumstances,\" he said.\n\nO'Brien noted that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been \"intimately\" and \"actively\" involved in the case and added that, along with U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and National Security Adviser John Bolton, America's chief diplomat has met with Tice's parents, Marc and Deborah Tice, on several occasions to brief the couple on any new developments.\n\nBefore the end of the year, Marc and Deborah Tice will undertake their seventh trip to the Middle East to apply for a visa to enter Syria. There, the couple hopes to be closer to Tice and reach out to whomever may be holding him captive.\n\n\"We continue our relentless effort to find the key that will open the door for Austin's freedom,\" Mr. Tice said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "Trump announces support for overhaul of criminal justice system", "description": "As staffing turmoil plagues the White House, the president has gathered senators on criminal justice reform", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-criminal-justice-reform-bill-announcement-today-2018-11-14-live-updates/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/05/24/be866f06-b6bb-481f-a626-f596f96f92d2/thumbnail/1200x630g2/3714b448e6a4370a61175f9a6ff4ea14/gettyimages-962109276.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T20:31:05Z", "content": "President Trump officially threw his support behind a criminal justice reform bill at the White House Wednesday afternoon, giving the legislation the push it might need to overcome a stall in the Senate. \"It's the right thing to do.

Forecasters predicted a 60 percent chance of favorable weather after a cold front moves through the area. The outlook improves to 90 percent \"go\" on Friday.\n\nAt the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport -- MARS -- at NASA's Wallops Island, Virginia, flight test facility, Northrop Grumman is readying an Antares rocket for launch early Friday to send a Cygnus cargo ship to the International Space Station. The automated spacecraft is packed with 7,385 pounds of equipment and supplies, including fresh fruit and ice cream.\n\nLaunch originally was planned for Thursday, but a 90 percent \"no-go\" forecast prompted a 24-hour delay. Liftoff now is targeted for 4:23:55 a.m. Friday, roughly the moment Earth's rotation carries MARS pad 0A into the plane of the space station's orbit. Forecasters expect a 45 percent chance of good weather, improving to 90 percent \"go\" on Saturday.\n\nHalf a world away at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, engineers are readying a Russian Progress cargo craft for a second launch to the International Space Station Friday afternoon. Loaded with 5,654 pounds of propellant, air, water and supplies, the Progress' Soyuz FG booster is scheduled for liftoff at 1:14:08 p.m. (12:14 a.m. Saturday local time).\n\nIf all goes well, the Cygnus cargo craft will reach the station around 4:35 a.m. Sunday, pulling up to within about 30 feet and then standing by while astronaut Serena Au\u00f1\u00f3n-Chancellor uses the lab's robot arm to lock on to a grapple fixture. From there, flight controllers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston will take over, pulling the supply ship in for berthing at the Earth-facing port of the central Unity module.\n\nRoscosmos\n\nTen hours later, the Progress is expected to arrive, guiding itself to an automated docking at the aft port of the Russian Zvezda service module around 2:30 p.m. It will be the first time two cargo ships have reached the station on the same day. Cosmonaut Sergey Prokopyev and Expedition 57 commander Alexander Gerst will be standing by in the Russian segment of the station to take over by remote control if any problems develop.\n\n\"Alexander Gerst is going to be helping out his Russian colleague for the Progress vehicle,\" said Joel Montalbano, deputy manager of the space station program at the Johnson Space Center. \"Normally, it's an automated docking, but they need to be prepared to go ahead and do a remote controlled docking (if necessary). We've worked with our Russian colleagues to ... give him some refresher training.\"\n\nThe Progress launch Friday will be the first station flight with a Soyuz FG booster since a dramatic launch abort Oct. 11 that forced vehicle commander Alexey Ovchinin and NASA flight engineer Nick Hague to execute a dramatic-but-safe emergency abort.\n\nRussian engineers concluded the mishap was caused by the failure of a strap-on booster to separate cleanly two minutes after liftoff. The booster, one of four making up the first stage, crashed into the rocket's central core stage, throwing the it out of control and triggering the abort.\n\nSince then, the Russians have launched three Soyuz boosters without incident for non-station flights. The Progress MS-10/71P launch Friday will be the fourth since the abort and if all goes well, the Russians will press ahead with plans to launch a fresh crew -- Soyuz MS-11/57S commander Oleg Kononenko, Canadian flight engineer David Saint-Jacques and NASA astronaut Anne McClain -- on Dec. 3.\n\nThey will join Gerst, Au\u00f1\u00f3n-Chancellor and Prokopyev aboard the station, boosting the lab's crew back to six for the first time since Oct. 4 when three other station fliers returned to Earth.\n\nThe day after the new crew's arrival, SpaceX is scheduled to launch a Dragon cargo ship that is expected to reach the space station on Dec. 6.\n\nGerst and his crewmates will return to Earth on Dec. 20, closing out a 196-day mission.

In addition, the court documents claim Herrell was declared the winner of New Mexico open 2nd congressional district by some New Mexico media outlets on election night.\n\nSome media outlets reported that Herrell was projected to win the race but rescinded that projection after Democrat Xochitl Torres Small began to close the gap and took the lead thanks to outstanding absentee ballots in Dona Ana County \u2014 a traditional Democratic stronghold.\n\nHerrell, 54, had declared victory on election night with early returns showing her in the lead and despite the high number of outstanding ballots in Dona Ana County.\n\nThe Associated Press called the race for Torres Small after the absentee ballots tallied Wednesday put her over the top.\n\nThe Dona Ana County Canvassing Board voted unanimously to certify the results Tuesday between Torres Small and Herrell following the last counting of provisional ballots.\n\nBut Herrell refused to concede and has alleged voting irregularities without providing evidence.

Herrell ran as a staunch backer of President Donald Trump, his support for a border wall and refused to take part in any television debates with Torres Small.\n\nHowever, Herrell also didn't campaign heavily in Hispanic neighborhoods and instead focused on pushing social issues to get her conservative base. She touted endorsements from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other conservatives.\n\nTorres Small, 33, ran as a moderate Democrat who promised to help the district's lucrative oil and gas industry and push for immigration reform while protecting the district's \"rural values.\" She highlighted endorsements from some Republicans.\n\nDemocrats have long targeted the heavily Hispanic congressional district that sits along the U.S.-Mexico border, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Grace Segers", "title": "Kevin McCarthy elected House minority leader and Steve Scalise will be minority whip", "description": "House Republicans held leadership elections for the 116th Congress on Wednesday", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kevin-mccarthy-elected-house-minority-leader-steve-scalise-will-be-minority-whip/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/10/23/a7debd8a-4c09-4fe3-ba2f-1282cf2e0db5/thumbnail/1200x630g2/7db9c718ecb3637ef7880b49455f61ca/gettyimages-906623586.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T19:12:34Z", "content": "House Republicans voted on Wednesday to make current House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy the minority leader by a wide margin, 159 to 43, in their leadership elections for the 116th Congress.

The deal includes $2,500 toward relocation costs, a $500 monthly stipend and a $1,500 bonus at the completion of 12 months in the city, according to the program's website. To qualify, you must be a full-time remote worker or self-employed outside of the state.\n\nIn other words, if you get a job in Tulsa, you don't qualify for the cash.\n\n\"I suspect that they don't want to be subsidizing people who come here and would otherwise be competing for jobs with local people,\" said Gene Perry, a director of strategy and communications at Tulsa-based Oklahoma Policy Institute. Perry spoke with CBS News in a telephone interview Wednesday.\n\nIt's not the first time cities and even states have offered cash to entice would-be residents. Burlington, Vermont, rolled out a similar program in June and all Alaskans are eligible for payouts via the state's Permanent Reserve Fund.\n\nBut what makes Tulsa's program unique is its focus on remote workers. On top of the cash subsidies, the program, dubbed \"Tulsa Remote,\" comes with a free membership to 36 Degrees North, a co-working space in the city, which ordinarily charges members $149 per month or more.\n\nIt's a growing segment of the workforce. According to a 2018 Upwork report, 63 percent of companies surveyed had at least one employee working remotely, and hiring managers predicted that in the next 10 years, 38 percent of their full-time employees will work mostly remotely.\n\nBut Tulsa Remote's backers anticipate some of the participants won't be remote workers forever. The idea is that some may eventually start their own businesses and permanently relocate to Tulsa, according to Ken Levit, executive director of the George Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\n\"So many people share with us that they're attracted to potentially moving here, especially from people in more expensive cities,\" wrote Levit in an email to CBS News on Wednesday. \"If you can come to town, and bring your job here, it can be a home run.\"\n\nThe George Kaiser Family Foundation is funding the program in its entirety and expects to spend somewhere between $250,00 to $500,000 in 2019 on 20 to 25 program recipients, but there's no hard limit to how many the program will welcome. Levit expects the first cohort will touch down in Tulsa in early 2019.\n\nMultiple calls to a Tulsa spokesperson were not immediately returned.\n\nOklahoma is one of the very few states whose cities rely entirely on sales tax for the government operating costs, said Perry. In Tulsa, an 8.517 percent sales tax, one of the highest in the nation, funds the city's operating budget, he explained. It's a model that would work well for high-income, potentially transient residents \u2014 like the ones Tulsa Remote may attract \u2014 who rent rather than own property.\n\n\"Anything they buy in the city, that's helping our economy and tax base,\" Perry said.\n\nWhile the Oklahoma state population has increased 14 percent since 2000, Tulsa's population growth has been sluggish, according to Census data. The city's population was 401,800 in 2017, a 2.2 percent increase from 2000.\n\n\"This is about getting people to move to Tulsa,\" said Matt Fabian, a partner at Massachusetts-based Municipal Market Analytic, in a telephone interview with CBS News on Wednesday. \"They need warm bodies.\"\n\nTulsa's current economic base is anchored on manufacturing and aerospace. American Airlines is the city's biggest employer, accounting for 7,000 jobs at its global maintenance and engineering facility, according to a 2017 report from Moody's Investors Service.

Zambada remains on the loose in Mexico, Lichtman claimed, because of bribes that \"go up to the very top,\" including hundreds of millions of dollars paid to the current and former presidents of Mexico.\n\n\"This is a case that will require you to throw out much of what you were taught to believe in about the way governments work and how they behave, governments in South and Central American and Mexico and even the United States,\" Lichtman said. \"This is a case which will require you to open your minds to the possibility that government officials at the very highest level can be bribed, can conspire to commit horrible crimes- that American law enforcement agents can also be crooked.\"\n\nA spokesman for Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto called the allegations \"completely false and defamatory.\" Former President Felipe Calderon dismissed them as \"absolutely false and reckless.\"\n\nWith the jury out of the courtroom, Cogan said the \"government motivations are not on trial,\" Gauthier reported, and Lichtman asked for a 10-minute break to \"adjust my opening statement accordingly.\"\n\nGuzman, who has been held in solitary confinement since his extradition to the United States early last year, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he amassed a multi-billion-dollar fortune smuggling tons of cocaine and other drugs in a vast supply chain that reached well north of the border.\n\nDespite his diminutive stature and nickname that means \"Shorty\" in Spanish, Guzman was once a larger-than-life figure in Mexico who has been compared to Al Capone and Robin Hood and been the subject of ballads known as narcocorridos.\n\nLichtman resumed his opening statement Wednesday, describing \"the myth of El Chapo\" as \"very strong.\" He said law enforcement agents had his client autograph $100 bills for them upon his arrest.\n\n\"Mr. Guzman was somebody who enjoyed the publicity,\" Lichtman said. \"He enjoyed the notoriety.\"\n\nThe defense attorney also described the government's witnesses as liars seeking to mitigate their own jail sentences.\n\n\"These are people who have lied every day,\" he said. \"They're here because they want to get out of jail by any means necessary.\"\n\nThe government called its first witness Wednesday morning, Gauthier reported, a former U.S. Customs special agent who focused on narcotics investigations."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "America's \"modern nomads\" give up their homes for life on the road in RVs", "description": "Sales of RVs in the U.S. are increasing, and some people are choosing to forego a stationary life in favor of traveling and living in recreational vehicles.

They accuse Pacific Gas & Electric Co. of failing to maintain infrastructure.\n\nShares in the San Francisco company plunged another 31 percent Wednesday, to $25.99. The have lost about 45 percent of their value since the Camp Fire broke out northeast of San Francisco, destroying thousands of homes and killing dozens of people as it leveled the town of Paradise. Investors fear the company does not have enough insurance to cover the losses and potential punitive damages it may face.\n\nPG&E told state regulators last week that it experienced a problem on a transmission line just before the blaze erupted in the vicinity. Investigators have not determined the cause of the blaze.\n\nThe pressure on PG&E comes even though Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation in September giving utilities some relief beginning next year. The law made it easier for utilities to pass along costs from fire-related damages to consumers and also avoid possible bankruptcy from a series of major fires that occurred during the 2017 fire season that produced more than $10 billion in losses.\n\nBut the law has a gap: No damages specific to 2018 were included, so utilities face a higher bar to bill customers to cover those costs. And this year has already supplanted 2017 as the most destructive in California's recorded history.\n\nAuthorities have not determined a cause for either of two major blazes burning now, but Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International, have reported irregularities with their equipment near the time and place where both ignited.\n\nBetsy Ann Cowley, a property owner near the site where a deadly wildfire started in Northern California, said Monday that PG&E sought access to her property just before the blaze started because the utility's power lines were causing sparks.\n\nMoody's Investors Service said Monday that the \"shortcomings\" in the legislation reflect negatively on PG&E's credit rating, which is barely investment grade.\n\n\"Moody's negative outlook incorporates the view that additional financial stress for PG&E is likely,\" Moody's spokesman Joe Mielenhausen said in an email. \"Going forward, we will look for signs of additional legislative and regulatory support for the utility as it works through various legal processes.\"\n\nA PG&E spokesman noted to CBS News that \"the cause of the Camp Fire has not yet been determined\" and then added: \"Nothing is more important than the safety of our customers, employees, contractors and the communities we serve. Our hearts are with the communities impacted by the Camp Fire. The loss of life and property is staggering. Right now, our entire company is focused on supporting first responders and assisting our customers and communities impacted by the Camp Fire. We encourage the public to follow their directions and warnings as fire conditions continue to change.\"\n\nLast week PG&E told state regulators that it detected a problem on an electrical transmission line near the site of the blaze minutes before the fire broke out. The utility later said it observed damage to a transmission tower on the line, and a PG&E spokeswoman said the company will cooperate with any investigations.\n\nSouthern California Edison told regulators there was an outage on an electrical circuit near the site where the Woolsey Fire started in Ventura County. It quickly spread into Malibu and destroyed hundreds of homes.\n\nSoCal Edison said the report was submitted out of an abundance of caution, and there was no indication from fire officials that its equipment may have been involved. The report said the fire was reported around 2:24 p.m. Thursday, two minutes after the outage.\n\nShares of parent company Edison International have tumbled more than 20 percent since the fire started."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "AP", "title": "Lawmakers near prison reform deal, but Trump support crucial", "description": "Senators have reached a tentative accord on the first major rewrite of criminal justice sentencing in a generation.

Congressional aides and advocacy groups said lawmakers are close to an agreement on the legislation, which would boost rehabilitation efforts for federal prisoners and give judges more discretion when sentencing nonviolent offenders, particularly for drug offenses.\n\nHolly Harris, executive director of Justice Action Network, a lead advocacy group, said, \"We're hoping for a full-throated endorsement\" from the president.\n\n\"This will be the most significant departure from the failed mandatory minimum policies of the 1990s,\" Harris said.\n\nThe bill is a rare bipartisan endeavor in a typically log-jammed Congress and has attracted support from a coalition of liberal and conservative groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and groups backed by the political donors Charles and David Koch. Critics say current sentencing guidelines are unfair and have had a lopsided impact on minority communities.\n\nMark Holden, general counsel for Koch Industries and a longtime champion of prison reform, said an endorsement from the National Fraternal Order of Police has been critical in generating momentum for the bill.\n\n\"You have a lot of people who want to get this done,\" Holden said.\n\nHe said the legislation would save taxpayer dollars by reducing prison populations and giving federal inmates the opportunity to be better people when they leave prison than when they entered. \"We wouldn't be in favor of it if it didn't protect public safety,\" Holden said.\n\nThe Senate package overhauls some of the mandatory sentencing guidelines that have been in place since 1994 legislation approved by Congress and signed into law by then-President Bill Clinton. Talks involved a bipartisan group headed by Sen. Chuck Grassley, the GOP chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Dick Durbin, the chamber's second-ranking Democrat, and others.\n\nBut Trump's backing remains key to proceeding with any final product.\n\n\"Senator Durbin has been negotiating in good faith, but there won't be any agreement on a criminal justice reform compromise unless and until President Trump supports it and asks the Republicans who control both chambers of Congress to move it forward,\" said Emily Hampsten, a spokeswoman for the Illinois Democrat.\n\nGrassley said the bill would be easier to pass after the departure of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was ousted by Trump last week. Sessions was a longtime opponent of criminal justice reform.\n\n\"I think we have a commitment from the Justice Department now to work with us on it,\" Grassley said.\n\nKushner may play an outsized role in the final outcome after having steered the legislation this far. \"History will say this was a man with a mission,\" Harris said. \"He was really the critical voice that was able to hold the bipartisan alliance together.\"\n\nThe federal inmate population has been on the decline since 2013, when it peaked at just more than 219,000. The total now stands at about 181,400, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Still, that's about triple the number of inmates in federal detention 30 years ago.\n\nThe House approved a prison reform bill in May, but the Senate package makes additional changes and adds the sentencing component.\n\nThe Senate approach would allow thousands of federal prisoners sentenced for crack cocaine offenses before August 2010 the opportunity to petition for a reduced penalty. It would also lower mandatory minimum sentences for some drug offenses. The life sentence for some drug offenders with three convictions, or \"three strikes,\" would be reduced to 25 years.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he would test support for the measure during the lame-duck session.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he talked to the president about the legislation Monday night and that he \"seemed supportive.\"\n\n\"I've never been more optimistic than I am now, but we're not there yet,\" Graham said.\n\nAll but two Republicans voted for the House bill when it was overwhelmingly approved in May, 360-59. Democratic lawmakers supported the bill by about a 2-to-1 margin, but opponents voiced concerns that it did not go far enough in giving judges more discretion to make the punishment fit the crime.\n\nThe House bill directs the Bureau of Prisons to conduct assessments for every offender once he or she is sentenced and to offer rehabilitation plans designed to lower the chance of recidivism. The plans would include vocational training, education, counseling and substance abuse treatment.\n\nThe National Fraternal Order of Police said the extra help should be targeted to those with the lowest risk \"to re-offend.\" The group said that \"truly dangerous offenders,\" such as those who traffic in fentanyl or commit crimes while armed, would be ineligible under the compromise legislation it's worked on with the Trump administration.\n\nThe debate comes after Florida voters approved a measure restoring the voting rights of felons who have served their sentences. The Freedom Partners Action Fund, backed by the Koch brothers, and the ACLU chapter in Florida called the measure a way to provide a second chance for Floridians who have served their time and paid their debts."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Grace Segers", "title": "Democrats launch investigation into Acting AG Whitaker's involvement in controversial company", "description": "Democrats poised to take over critical House committees are going to investigate Whitaker\u2019s involvement with World Patent Marketing", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/democrats-launch-investigation-into-acting-ag-matthew-whitakers-involvement-in-controversial-company/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/13/0df5a5d4-a649-4a7f-ac2b-1ffa4de57ad1/thumbnail/1200x630/ff96694ec1e80442a134e69b3e8facbe/cbsn-fusion-top-congressional-democrats-demanding-acting-attorney-general-matt-whitaker-recuse-himself-from-robert-muellers-investigation-thumbnail-1710862-640x360.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T17:40:27Z", "content": "House Democrats are launching an investigation into Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker's involvement in World Patent Marketing, where he served as a paid adviser for the Florida company shut down by a federal judge earlier this year and fined almost $26\u2026 [+2207 chars]", "fulltext": "House Democrats are launching an investigation into Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker's involvement in World Patent Marketing, where he served as a paid adviser for the Florida company shut down by a federal judge earlier this year and fined almost $26 million for allegedly running an invention-promotion scam.\n\nThe Democrats poised to take over the committees on Oversight, Government Reform, Judiciary, Energy and Commerce and Intelligence announced on Wednesday that they are requesting information relating to Whitaker's role at World Patent Marketing.\n\n\"Because Mr. Whitaker was not confirmed by the Senate, both Republican and Democratic constitutional law experts warned that his appointment was, and continues to be, unconstitutional.

The state police account contradicts witnesses who say Roberson, 26, was wearing clothing that identified him as a security guard; police say he was wearing \"plain black clothing with no markings.\"\n\nState police are investigating the shooting by the white officer from the Midlothian Police Department, who has not been identified. Protesters gathered Tuesday outside the Midlothian Police headquarters, some carrying portraits of Roberson, an aspiring police officer who played the organ at his and other area churches. A family attorney has said the young man was a father and that his girlfriend is pregnant with their second child.\n\nWednesday, community activists held a rally to call for Cook County State's Attorney Kimberly Foxx to investigate the shooting and for the officer involved to resign.\n\n\"This young man has a nine-month-old son -- he'll never see his child grow up,\" said local pastor Anthony Williams. \"This young man wanted to be a police [officer.] This young man was a child of God -- he worked in the church and lost his life, unfortunately, so we want justice.\"\n\nVia CBS Chicago\n\nPolice said a gunman had entered Manny's Blue Room Lounge in Robbins early Sunday morning, and shot and wounded multiple people inside the bar. When officers arrived at the scene, Roberson was holding down a suspect on the ground outside the bar, witnesses told CBS Chicago.\n\n\"A Midlothian Police Officer encountered a subject in plain black clothing with no markings readily identifying him as a Security Guard, armed with a gun in the west parking lot,\" state police said late Tuesday. \"According to witness statements, the Midlothian officer gave the armed subject multiple verbal commands to drop the gun and get on the ground before ultimately discharging his gun and striking the subject.\"\n\nIllinois State Police said the investigation later determined that the \"armed subject\" was a security guard and was \"attempting to subdue a subject believed to be involved in the initial shooting\" when he was killed.\n\nAn attorney for Roberson's mother says Roberson was wearing a hat emblazoned with the word \"security\" when he was shot. Gregory E. Kulis, who filed a lawsuit contending the shooting was unjustified and unprovoked, said the police release is woefully incomplete.\n\nFor starters, he said witnesses have told him that they yelled repeatedly both before and as the officer raised his weapon that Roberson was a security guard. Kulis suggested it's possible there was no mention of Roberson's knit cap because witnesses said it came off as emergency workers tried to administer CPR.\n\nAnother security guard at the tavern said the officer jumped onto the bar and waved an assault rifle before running outside and fatally shooting the guard, Kulis said.\n\nKulis said the surviving guard told him that the officer pointed a gun at him until he screamed at him that he was a security guard.\n\n\"That's when he jumped off the bar, waving the gun, and ran outside the door,\" said Kulis, who declined to identify the other security guard.\n\nAn official in a neighboring community has echoed the call for prosecutors to investigate, saying he's concerned race played a role in the shooting.\n\n\"Here is a security guard who is subduing a suspect,\" but the officer \"just sees a black man with a gun and kills him,\" Alderman Keith Price said.\n\nKulis would not say if he thinks race played a role in Chicago-area shooting, but the fact that the officer is white and Roberson was black has prompted some \u2014 including a prominent local African-American newspaper columnist \u2014 to question the officer's thinking.\n\n\"I believe a police officer showing up at a chaotic scene where a white man has a gun would have at least hollered for him to put the gun down before opening fire,\" Chicago Sun-Times columnist Mary Mitchell wrote after the shooting. \"But too often, black men are not given the benefit of the doubt.\"\n\nThe Illinois State Police wouldn't respond to a series of questions from CBS News, including regarding the contradictory accounts of Roberson's clothing, how much time elapsed between the time the officer shouted commands and opened fire, whether video exists of the shooting, whether the officer pointed his gun at another security guard, and how they respond to those who say race played a role.\n\nA spokesman said the investigation is ongoing and no further information outside of the statement would be released at this time.\n\nIn an initial statement, Midlothian Police Chief Daniel Delaney said only that the officer shot \"a subject with a gun.\" The officer has been placed on administrative leave, which is standard in such shootings until the investigation is complete, the chief said.\n\nDelaney later issued a statement Tuesday saying that there were conflicting reports immediately after the shooting about whether Roberson was a suspect or a security guard, reports the Chicago Tribune.\n\nDelaney said in the statement: \"Jemel Roberson was a brave man who was doing his best to end an active shooter situation at Manny's Blue Room.\"\n\n\"The Midlothian Police Department is completely saddened by this tragic incident and we give our heartfelt condolences to Jemel, his family and his friends. There are no words that can be expressed as to the sorrow his family is dealing with,\" the statement says.\n\nKulis said he is trying to gather information about the officer, who he said came to the Midlothian department four years ago from another department and is a member of a SWAT team.\n\n\"Where is the footage?\"\n\nPrice, the alderman, said he learned from witnesses that there are security cameras inside and outside the bar.\n\nFootage from surveillance or body cameras could explain whether Roberson was clearly identifiable as a security guard. Audio could determine what, if anything, was said to the officer before the shooting and whether, as witnesses have told the media, they shouted to the officer before he fired that Roberson was a security guard.\n\nSuch footage could also help investigators determine what kind of charges should be filed against the man who is suspected of firing a gun inside the bar. The man was one of four people who suffered non-life threatening gunshot wounds. Some community members have called for the release of any video, reports CBS Chicago.\n\n\"They say there's footage. Where is the footage? Let due process properly take its place in terms of what happened here,\" pastor Mitchell Lee Hicks told the station.\n\nIf any police bodycam video exists, no state law requires that it be released. The Chicago Police Department releases video within 90 days of a shooting, but that policy does not apply because that agency's officers were not involved.\n\nKulis also said he doesn't yet know how many times Roberson was shot or where on his body he was shot.\n\n\"I talked to the family after they viewed his body and they said they (authorities) did not tell them how many times he'd been shot,\" he said.\n\nIn his $1 million federal lawsuit, Kulis contends that the officer who shot Roberson violated the man's 4th Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\n\"The use of force is considered a seizure, and he needed probable cause to use force and he did not have that,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Aimee Picchi", "title": "A handgun for Christmas: Company buys firearms for every employee", "description": "Owner of small manufacturer in Wisconsin says his aim was a \"memorable\" gift, and employees were trained on gun safety", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-handgun-for-christmas-wisconsin-company-benshot-buys-firearms-for-every-employee-ahead-of-holidays/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/14/b7efd76e-bee6-4a09-a3f1-efc72cf1d095/thumbnail/1200x630/1141528a9fa9e8fbced7f491ad65244b/gettyimages-636139026.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T17:03:48Z", "content": "A Wisconsin manufacturing company gave its employees what may be one of the more unusual corporate Christmas gifts: firearms.

Its soda-brewing machine, the Keurig Kold, fizzled out after less than a year on the market, after consumers complained about its $370 price tag and disappointing flavors.\n\nWhile the Drinkworks home bar costs less than the Keurig Kold, consumers still need to buy individual pods, which adds to the price of at-home cocktails. A four-pack of cocktail pods costs $16 and a four-pack of beer pods is $10, according to CNET. Consumers will also need to buy carbon dioxide canisters, which cost $15 for a two-pack. Each one can make 15 drinks.\n\nMany of its ingredients are sourced from suppliers, such as barrel-strength whiskeys from distillers that haven't yet been diluted water, CNET noted.

Edward Wagner was the long-time former boyfriend of 19-year-old Hanna Rhoden, one of the eight victims, and shared custody of their daughter at the time of the massacre.\n\nEdward Wagner was also charged with unlawful sexual conduct with a minor for having sexual contact with Rhoden when she was 15 years old and he was 20 years old, DeWine's office said.\n\nThe Wagner family lived near the scenes of the killings about 60 miles south of Columbus. They moved to Kenai, Alaska, in June 2017, then returned to Ohio this past spring.\n\nKelly Cinereski, an Alaskan pastor and friend of the family, told the Dayton Daily News he was shocked by their arrests. \"These people wept over dogs, I can't imagine them taking people's lives,\" he said.\n\nThe mothers of Angela Wagner and George Wagner also were arrested in Ohio and charged with misleading investigators.\n\nBoth Edward Wagner and Angela Wagner previously told the Cincinnati Enquirer that they were not involved in the killings.

Wagner also told The Enquirer that her husband, George, and Christopher Rhoden Sr. were more like brothers than friends.\n\nJohn Clark, a lawyer who has been representing the Wagners, has said previously that four of the Wagner family members provided laptops, phones and DNA samples to investigators, and agreed to be interviewed about the slayings.\n\n\"We look forward to the day when the true culprits will be discovered and brought to justice for this terrible tragedy,\" Clark said in a statement Tuesday."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Christopher Brito", "title": "Women wear hoodies at mall to make point about racial profiling", "description": "Rapper Yo Gotti praised them on Instagram, saying, \"These women helped bring light to the double standard we face in our community and across America\"", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/women-hoodies-mall-tennessee-cordova-memphis-wolfchase-galleria-shannon-arthur-yo-gotti-kevin-mckenzie/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/14/e5e9f42f-8f6b-43ba-aab3-a9d261745551/thumbnail/1200x630/3b5b3b0e7afb2493fe6c8c1fcf599c3d/women.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T16:11:27Z", "content": "In a viral social media post, a group of white women challenged a Tennessee mall's unwritten policy banning hoodies and accused the facility of racial profiling.

Her memoir, \"Becoming,\" released Tuesday, already sits on top of best-seller lists. In it, the former first lady details her unlikely path from growing up in a small apartment in Chicago's South Side to living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In a wide-ranging conversation, \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Gayle King spoke to Obama in Chicago about the current state of American politics, overcoming self-doubt, and couples' therapy with Barack Obama. In their first national TV interview together, King also spoke with Obama with her mother, Marian Robinson, about life inside the White House.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 1: \"The presidency isn't ours to own\"\n\nGAYLE KING: It seems that whatever the Obama administration has done, it seems the current administration wants to undo. How do you handle that when you look at the work that you all have done?\n\nMICHELLE OBAMA: You know, the truth is, is that the-- the presidency isn't ours to own... It's the people's jobs. ... It's not how me and Barack feel... Because we occupied that seat for eight years and did the best that we could do. And the next president that is voted in gets to do the same thing. You know, the question that we have to ask, as citizens and as voters, what direction do we want our country to go in? And we-- we saw here that when you sit out, sometimes you get what you want, sometimes you don't. That's the nature of our democracy.\n\nKING: Why do you think Donald Trump won this election? You probably don't spend much time thinking about it.\n\nOBAMA: Because a lot of people came to the polls, and a lot of people didn't. ... Our democracy is clear. It's just sometimes people think, \"My vote doesn't count.\" And that's just so wrong. ... Voting matters. And the people who go to the polls determine how the country is going to be led. The notion that voting doesn't work, that it's fixed. No, it's not. You know? We saw in this midterm people wanted the country to move in a different direction. And they came out in record numbers. And they voted. And that's how it works.\n\nKING: Do you still believe, 'When they go low, we go high?' After all that has happened?\n\nOBAMA: Absolutely. Absolutely. You know, what's the alternative? You know, because going low means you're operating from your place of emotion. You know? It doesn't necessarily mean you're operating from a place of results... More often than not, you don't get results when you go low. You just, you know, get your attitude out. ... And... when you're in the White House, and you have that platform, and that responsibility where every word matters, you know, you're often thinking-- or at least Barack and I often thought, is what we're about to say gonna help? Is it gonna move the needle forward? Or is it just gonna make us feel vindicated in the moment? And you learn that vindication in the moment is so short term. ... Going high doesn't mean you don't feel-- have feelings, and that you don't express feelings... That you don't acknowledge hurt, or pain, or anger. You know, that's not what going high is. Going high means now you-- now you have the feeling. How do you express that feeling in the world? And how do you do that responsibly?\n\nKING: You end your book with, \"Let's let kindness in.\" You still feel optimistic about our country.\n\nOBAMA: Yes.\n\nKING: And we the people. We as a nation.\n\nOBAMA: Yeah. Because I-- I lived in the country, you know? I traveled the country. ... I saw the heart of who we are... Forget race, or party, or ethnicity, or gender. People agree with us or not. People were kind. ... People are worried. People have issues. But everybody's working for the same thing. The same goal. And I got to see that part of America.\n\nPart 2: \"Series of punches\" and almost leaving the campaign\n\nAs first lady, Obama found herself on the world stage as one of the most visible women in the world. But growing up she says she was haunted by self-doubt \u2013 one of the revelations in her memoir. In her conversation with King, Obama describes learning that she was not alone in wondering, \"Am I good enough?\"\n\nKING: You've been out of the White House for 663 days.\n\nOBAMA: Oh my gosh. (LAUGHTER)\n\nKING: How's it going?\n\nOBAMA: It's going okay.\n\nKING: I want people to get a sense, Michelle, of your life.\n\nOBAMA: Uh-huh. Yeah. My life now?\n\nKING: Your life now.\n\nOBAMA: Uh-huh.\n\nKING: And that first day. It's one of those rare moments. I call it Toast-gate for lack of a better thing. Toast-gate.\n\nOBAMA: Yeah. (LAUGH) This is how I open up the book, as sort of the life that I was living months after we had moved out of the White House. ... I was alone for the first time in a long time. ... Because for eight years prior to that, I had lived a life where I was always with somebody. There was always a constant presence in the White House. ... But that day... Barack was traveling, Malia was in college, Sasha was somewhere doing something. And it was just me, and Bo, and Sunny, my dogs. ... And I did what I didn't do for eight years, which was open up my own cupboard, pull out some bread, and make some cheese toast.\n\nKING: Did you remember how to do that?\n\nOBAMA: I remembered! ... I still had cheese toast skills.\n\nKING: Throughout the book there is a lot of, \"Am I good enough?\" ... You're told by a school counselor, \"You're not Princeton material\"... Why did that not destroy you at the time?\n\nOBAMA: Well, because fortunately... it was the direct opposite of everything I had ever been told about myself. ... I had grown up with love and support and encouragement and high expectations. ... But here I walked into this room with a woman who really didn't know me, because it was a big high school, and she had to make a quick assessment. And her assessment could've been-- and I don't know-- was, \"Grade point average? Yeah, you're a good student. You know, your scores are good. You're black. You're here in this public school. Maybe you're stretching.\" She didn't even know my brother went to Princeton. She didn't ask me any questions. ... She didn't try to figure me out. She just decided that the dream I presented was wrong. ... But let me tell you... we could probably go into any room of black women, or people of color, or people who grew up in poor communities, or rural communities, and you'd ask them, \"Has anybody ever told you you couldn't?\" And everyone would raise their hand.\n\nKING: You get to Princeton, and one of the first things you notice is... \"They're not smarter than me.\"\n\nOBAMA: Mmm-hmm. So now I'm expecting brilliance. Genius. And then what I discover is, wow, there's a lot of arbitrariness to this stuff, you know? Because while a lot of students are sort of criticized, there's a debate about affirmative action when it comes to race. What I point out is that I got to Princeton, I realized there's a whole-- all kinds of affirmative action that goes on. There are kids who get in because they're athletes. There are kids who get in because there's a legacy. ... It's just that race stands out. ... But it was important for me to see that.\n\n[OBAMA during the 2008 campaign: \"Are you tired of the way the country is going? Are you mad enough?\"]\n\nKING: Did you feel you were judged differently? Because you write in the book your grace would have to be earned.\n\nOBAMA: Mmm-hmm.\n\nKING: You knew that you-- you felt you could not stumble.\n\nOBAMA: Yeah. Well I-- I had experienced that over the course of the campaign. ... I write in Chapter 17, you know, that chapter was probably one of the hardest for me to write. And it's the hardest, still, for me to read. Because it goes over a painful time in the campaign when I thought I was doing great telling my story, sharing it honestly. But... my whole persona was distorted. This was the time I was called an 'angry black woman.' I was called 'Obama's babies' mama.' I was called someone who didn't love her country. And I-- I-- I-- I-- it's important for me to paint all that. Because people don't remember that. They see Michelle Obama. Now, especially young girls. And they don't-- they don't-- they were too young to know that part of my journey.\n\nKING: Let's go back to 'angry black woman.' How did you process that? ... It's painful.\n\nOBAMA: It's like the punch in the gut that the counselor... it was another series of punches. Someone who judged me without knowing me. It was just happening at a bigger level. ... But I had to draw on the same foundation of, I cannot let one, or two, or a few people's judgements of me control me. And at that point I had thought about getting off the campaign trail. And I--\n\nKING: You went to Barack Obama and said--\n\nOBAMA: Yeah. I was like, \"Look, if I'm not an asset, then just pull me out.\" And he was like, \"No. You are--you're the closer. You know, we need you out there.\" And so I had to get myself together... I'm gonna have to show the world that I do belong. I am good enough to be the first lady. I do love my country.\n\nPart 3: Martial counseling, and her mother, Marian Robinson\n\nMichelle Obama says it was never easy being the wife of a driven politician. The demands of campaigning and politics strained their marriage, she said, and they sought help in couples' therapy. In their first national TV interview together, King also spoke with Marian Robinson, Obama's mother, about her eight years in the White House.\n\nKING: You've had a complicated relationship, it seems, with politics.\n\nOBAMA: Mmm-hmm. Every time Barack came to me with the idea of running for an office, I was just like, \"Please don't do this. Pick another career. You're gifted. Y'all went to college. You got a law degree. Can't you do anything else besides this?\" There's so many ways to save the world. But every time I had to think to myself, that approach is selfish. Because I knew I was married to someone who was gifted and someone who could contribute. And but for the fact that I was married to him... it would be hard on me-- I would want him to run.\n\nKING: Yeah. But he was always a different kind of guy.\n\nOBAMA: He's a different guy--\n\nKING: He's a different kind of dude. There's a great story in the book where you said, you wake up one night, and he's staring into space. Is he thinking about his dad? Or is something bothering him?\n\nOBAMA: (LAUGH) Right.\n\nKING: And what was he thinking about?\n\nOBAMA: Like, income inequality. It's like, really, dude? I thought you were dreaming about me.\n\nKING: So you knew he was different. ... You're very candid about talking about marital counseling.\n\nOBAMA: Mmm-hmm. You know, I-- I tell young couples it's like when you get married, you've got that moment. Those-- those years, if you're lucky, where it's just the two of you. Individuals on your paths. You come together when you need to. It all works until you have kids. Your first joint project where the inequalities are felt, you know... I'm working, and managing child care, and sick kids, and trying to coordinate my job, and he's flittering in... Tension started to-- to arise. And we knew that we needed to have a place where we could really work these feelings out.\n\nKING: Was he like, \"Great, let's go to counseling\"?\n\nOBAMA: Oh, no. Oh, no. No, he was--\n\nKING: \"I can't wait to go.\"\n\nOBAMA: He was-- Barack is a problem solver. It's like, \"I'll buy a book, and we will study--\"\n\nKING: (LAUGH) On relationships.\n\nOBAMA: On relationships. And we still study Chapter 12. You read Chapter 13. And we can figure this out. You know? It's just one of those things. It's like we don't need help from anybody. And I was like-- Because for me I was like, I need to go to somebody who's going to tell you you're wrong-- exactly, and I talk about that. It's like, well, I didn't get that. The period of counseling, for me, was a turning point. Because I learned that... I was still responsible for my own happiness. ... It wasn't his job to solely make me happy. I had to figure out my space in this.\n\nKING: Do you still feel if we need to go back, we would do that? Even--\n\nOBAMA: Absolutely.\n\nKING: --even though that you're so well known now?\n\nOBAMA: Oh, gosh, yes! Yeah. I-- I-- I think counseling is one of those tune up times. ... Marriage is hard. All marriages are hard. And even-- look, I-- you-- you know us. I love my husband.\n\nKING: Yeah.\n\nOBAMA: We have a wonderful marriage. But it takes work.\n\nLazarus Jean-Baptiste/CBS News\n\nKING (to ROBINSON): The whole eight years you were in the White House, I think I could count how many times I saw you on TV. And I got up to one, and then I had to stop.\n\nMARIAN SHIELDS ROBINSON: Stop. (LAUGH)\n\nKING: Yeah. It's just not something that you do. ... But why is it that you didn't want to do interviews, Mrs. Robinson?\n\nROBINSON: I didn't want to say anything that would-- you know how you accidentally say things? I figured if I didn't say anything, then I wouldn't say the wrong thing. (LAUGH)\n\nKING: We don't have to worry about that. ... When your daughter becomes first lady of the United States, and your son-in-law is the president, how do you wrap your brain around that? What are you thinking?\n\nROBINSON: It's pretty difficult. Let's face it.\n\nKING: Uh-huh. Why?\n\nROBINSON: Because I felt like this was going to be a very hard life for both of them. And I want-- was worried about their safety. And I was worried about my grandkids. I mean, that's what got me to move to D.C.\n\nKING: Why did you want her there? Why was it important to you?\n\nOBAMA: Oh, because-- for the girls. You know, I-- I-- I wanted them to come home to family... There was just parts of the girls' lives that I just knew were gonna be okay 'cause mom was there. When I traveled internationally, grandma was there. When I wasn't home at the end of the day, grandma was there. When the kids were still little and they needed to have someone be with them in school. I mean, you think about my girls were being driven around in a motorcade of three cars with at least four grown adults with guns in each of those cars. And I just thought that that's an unnatural way for a little second grader to go to school. Well, mom would ride in the car with her to make it feel like a regular carpool.\n\nKING: You're in the White House where they say, \"Mrs. Robinson, can we get you something? Mrs. Robinson, do you need anything?\"\n\nROBINSON: Right.\n\nKING: Was that a big adjustment for you?\n\nROBINSON: It was a huge adjustment. As a matter of fact, I had talked them into allowing me to do my own laundry.\n\nKING: You were doing your own laundry?\n\nROBINSON: Yes. (LAUGH)\n\nOBAMA: And she taught the girls how to do their laundry. They would go upstairs for laundry lessons. And she was the most beloved figure in the White House. Let me tell you.\n\nKING: I believe that.\n\nOBAMA: And she had a stream of people. The butlers, the housekeepers. They would all stop by, and they would-- grandma's room was like the confessional. You know, everyone would go there and just unload, you know? And then they'd leave. People still visit mom in Chicago.\n\nROBINSON: They were like family.\n\nOBAMA: Some of the staff come and visit. If they're in town in Chicago, they visit her.\n\nKING: Do you feel you have your life back? Do you miss the White House at all.\n\nROBINSON: No. Not at all. (LAUGH)\n\nKING: You have your life back.\n\nROBINSON: You know, I do miss the people. Because they're-- they were like family to me. And... we got pretty close there.\n\nKING: Your mom says she doesn't miss the White House. Do you?\n\nOBAMA: No. No. I mean, the eight years was more than enough. And what I realized over the years is that home is where we are. You know? And the White House happened to be our home for eight years. But we took all that love and energy, and we just moved it to another house. It's still there. And... that's the part of life that's important.\n\nKING: What's the best thing about Michelle Obama that makes you proudest?\n\nROBINSON: Well, now I-- my saying is, when I grow up, I would like to be like Michelle Obama.

May's government or the EU were expected to make the full details of the draft Brexit proposal public this week.\n\nMay's negotiating team handed its 500-page proposal over to cabinet members earlier on Wednesday, after they finally nailed down an agreement with EU counterparts on what has proved the most contentious issue; keeping the border between Northern Ireland (which is Britain) and Ireland (which is Europe) open and unrestricted.\n\nThe proposal from May's team would, according to details leaked to British media, temporarily keep the entire U.K. within the European customs union, in exchange for the EU allowing the Irish border to remain free of physical barriers or checkpoints. That key tradeoff means Britain would still, for an unclear period, be subject to the EU's collective trade rules.\n\nThe trade union mandates tariff-free movement of goods across national boundaries within the bloc, and sets standardized rates for imports from outside the EU. It also sets dozens of other rules for trade within the EU.\n\nMay must convince her own\n\nIt has taken more than two years of agonizing negotiations in Brussels, set in motion by the 2016 public referendum result demanding the U.K. leave the European bloc, to get to this point. With her cabinet's backing secured, May must now win over even more skeptics in her own party.\n\nMany in the divided Conservative Party believe her proposal leaves Europe with too much control over Britain's trade and borders, certainly if the U.K. remains for any considerable period part of the bloc's customs union. More philosophically, and perhaps more importantly from a public perpective, they argue that such a deal would betray the British public's will after the majority vote to leave the EU.\n\nShe insists her proposal delivers on key promises to reduce Europe's checks on British trade and immigration.\n\n\"We will deliver Brexit. We will not rerun the referendum,\" she vowed on the floor of the British Parliament on Wednesday.\n\nShe has framed the choice that faced her senior aides, and which now faces the British Parliament, in stark terms: accept her deal with the EU, which she says is the best one Britain could possibly attain, or reject it and leave Britain susceptible to as-yet-unclear consequences when the divorce happens anyway on March 29, as stipulated by EU rules.\n\nExperts, politicians and pundits have warned for months that such a \"no-deal\" Brexit could cripple trade and the flow of essential goods into Britain, given that the kingdom would suddenly have no trade agreements in place with its most vital trading partner; the other 27 members of the European Union.\n\nWhat May does not often discuss in public is the third option: a rejection of her Brexit proposal, and her leadership entirely.\n\nPossibility of a party rebellion\n\nIf enough senior members of May's party balk at the deal, it could still lead to a challenge for the leadership of the party. In Britain's version of democracy, that means she could theoretically be unseated as Prime Minister and her entire government replaced through a snap election.\n\n(Put simply, in the U.K. the public elects a party to lead the government, rather than a single person to lead the executive branch, as in the U.S. Party leaders are elected internally, and the leader of the party which wins a majority of seats in Parliament [when there is a clear majority] serves as prime minister.)\n\nA senior party member warned hardline Conservative \"Brexiteers\" on Wednesday, that if they fail to back May's proposal, it could backfire on them.\n\nFormer Conservative Party leader William Hague, who voted to \"Remain\" in the 2016 referendum, said the public's decision must now be respected, and warned that rejecting May's proposal in hopes of a better deal would be inherently risky: \"If you don't take this opportunity to leave the EU, to get Brexit over the line, you might never leave at all,\" he told BBC's Radio 4.\n\nA second referendum?\n\nThat last remark from Hague was an acknowledgement of a growing movement in the U.K. -- in the public and among lawmakers from all major parties, including some Conservatives -- for a second public referendum on any Brexit deal eventually agreed on by Parliament.\n\nBoth left-leaning British lawmakers who never wanted to leave the EU, and some ardent backers of the vote to \"Leave\" have pushed for a second referendum, albeit with starkly different motivations.\n\nWhile the Brexiteers are hoping another vote would bolster the mandate for a \"hard\" Brexit (a clean break, with the U.K. leaving all EU customs and trade agreements), many \"Remainers\" believe a second referendum could see the British public completely reverse its 2016 decision and reject any Brexit at all. The EU has left open the possibility of a British reversal.\n\nRemainers point to polls which show a shift in opinion over the last two years, during which time the Brexit movement has been accused of lying about the potential benefits and pitfalls of a divorce from the EU -- and breaking Britain's election laws -- during the bitter campaign ahead of the first referendum.\n\nHague suggested on Wednesday that if May's cabinet had failed to back her proposal, \"it would probably mean a different government.\"\n\nWith the cabinet's backing secured, any potential challenges appeared to be staved off on Wednesday, at least for the time being,\n\nBut senior members of May's cabinet have already left over her handling of the entire Brexit negotiations, including lead Brexit campaigner and former London Mayor Boris Johnson. If anyone from within the Conservative Party was to stage a challenge to May for leadership, his name is high in the betting odds.\n\nThe terms of the divorce still need to be agreed not only by Britain's Parliament (and possibly the public if a second referendum is called), but also by the governments of all 27 other EU member states.\n\nIf a deal is not finalized and put in place by March 29, the British withdrawal from the EU will be triggered automatically (no-deal Brexit) and all standing trade agreements between Britain and the EU will end. Britain's trade with all non-EU nations is also currently controlled to a large degree by EU regulations -- it also currently benefits from the collective bargaining power of membership in the 28-member bloc.\n\nBroad World Trade Organization rules would apply under that scenario, but without specific deals in place, economists say the cost of trade for the U.K. would increase significantly, at least until new agreements are reached."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "11/14: CBSN AM", "description": "Death toll rises to 50 across California; Mega Millions winner yet to claim $1.5 billion prize", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/1114-cbsn-am/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/14/b421fd4c-85fd-45c3-8af7-d48f62a16177/thumbnail/1200x630/68afc7f1afb9dd28664d93d07b7101c9/1114-cbsn-7amfullepisode-1711927-640x360.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T15:20:35Z", "content": null, "fulltext": ""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS News", "title": "Here's how Justice Dept lawyers argue Whitaker's appointment is lawful", "description": "Critics of the Trump administration are already suing over Matt Whitaker's appointment", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/heres-how-justice-department-lawyers-argue-whitakers-appointment-is-lawful/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/07/f74d39d5-62d0-4eef-be49-234c5b414b96/thumbnail/1200x630/a165d8635731d7750f3d9d8b95c87847/1107-en-sessions-pegues-1706637-640x360.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T15:15:22Z", "content": "The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel on Wednesday released the legal advice it gave the White House as to whether a senior Justice Department official like Matt Whitaker could be appointed acting attorney general, CBS News' Paula Reid reports.

Several contractors complained they were not paid, and a process server for one could not even find Whitaker or his company to serve him with a lawsuit.\n\nAfter being appointed last week by President Trump to the nation's top law enforcement job, Whitaker's history as a former federal prosecutor, Republican Party loyalist and critic of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation has come under scrutiny, as have some of his business dealings.\n\nWhitaker is expected to return to his home state Wednesday to speak at a conference at a downtown Des Moines hotel, about two miles from the Ingersoll Avenue apartment building that he once saw as an investment opportunity. After years of rising costs, Whitaker stopped work on the project by early 2016 and sold the building months later.\n\n\"He did not complete the project due to cost overruns and a bad general contractor,\" Department of Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said late Tuesday.\n\nKupec didn't identify the contractor, but a handyman listed in public records as working under Whitaker on the project didn't return a phone message.\n\nCity officials raced to see the project completed to avoid losing federal money, and contractors filed liens seeking compensation for more than $32,000 in unpaid work.\n\nA company formed by Whitaker and two partners, MEM Investment, was awarded a $166,000 city loan to renovate the vacant three-story complex in 2012, through a Department of Housing and Urban Development grant program to promote affordable housing. A reorganization in 2014 made Whitaker the company's sole owner.\n\nAll but $25,000 of the loan would be forgiven as long as the project was completed by 2017 and half of its 22 units were restricted to low-income tenants for five years. But what was once thought to be a $400,000 project for lead testing and site improvements became more expensive as additional work and damage piled up, records show.\n\nWhitaker refinanced his mortgage on the building to get more funding and put an undisclosed amount of his own money into the project.\n\nBeginning in February 2015, city officials said they repeatedly communicated the urgency of finishing the project to Whitaker during meetings, letters and phone calls. But by March 2016, an inspection showed \"there had been minimal, if any, additional rehabilitation work completed since the previous inspection\" several months earlier, city planner Mary Neiderbach wrote to Whitaker on April 1, 2016.\n\n\"In addition, more damage had occurred to the building's interior because of what appears to be a roof leak and missing downspouts on the back of the building,\" she wrote, adding that Whitaker's company \"appears to have abandoned the property.\"\n\nThe letter informed Whitaker that the city was terminating the loan agreement and gave him 30 days to pay back $151,620 that he had been advanced. It noted that the city had to complete the work by the end of 2016 or repay HUD, and that it did not have confidence Whitaker's company was up to that task.\n\nWhitaker did not reply to the city's notice. His lender, Lincoln Savings Bank, soon declared Whitaker's company in default after he ignored demands to pay back a mortgage that had ballooned to $687,000, records show. The bank initiated foreclosure proceedings on the property in July 2016, seeking to be paid back ahead of the city and contractors.\n\nThe contractors included an electrician who filed a lawsuit seeking to collect more than $14,000 in unpaid invoices. A process server said in a court filing that repeated visits to three addresses listed for Whitaker's company and his law firm turned up nothing other than dark, locked offices. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed after both Whitaker and the contractor failed to show up to a scheduled court hearing that had been announced in the newspaper.\n\nWhitaker's company did add value to the building, which it bought for $200,000 in 2012 and sold for $650,000 four years later.\n\nAs part of an exit agreement, Whitaker's company agreed to sell the building to developer Jeff Young, to \"provide a portion of the Lincoln Savings Bank repayment and to settle all contractor liens against the property,\" an August 2016 city memo showed. It's unclear whether the contractors have been repaid in full.\n\nThe memo said Young was expected to complete the project by the looming December 2016 HUD deadline.\n\nKupec said the buyer also assumed Whitaker's loan, and the city didn't take any legal action.\n\nAttorney Jeff Courter, who represented Lincoln Savings Bank, said its foreclosure petition had been resolved but declined to comment further."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "CBS/AP", "title": "\"Ghastly scheme\": Man accused of intentionally driving off pier, killing sons", "description": "Two boys, Abdelkarim, 8, and Elhassan, 13, couldn't swim and were strapped in child seats", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ali-elmezayen-man-charged-with-fraud-after-his-severely-autistic-children-to-their-deaths-2018-11-14/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/14/de6c56f9-cc16-4410-80d0-20558f47ef31/thumbnail/1200x630/38e24da781e7c816b5e0d4e4b9f2334a/boat.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T14:42:58Z", "content": "LOS ANGELES -- An Egyptian man was held without bail Tuesday on federal charges of fraudulently collecting insurance payouts after driving his severely autistic children to their deaths when he sped off a pier into the Port of Los Angeles.

His partner, Rabab Diab, couldn't swim, but she was rescued by a fisherman after surfacing and screaming, \"My kids, my kids.\"\n\nTwo boys, Abdelkarim, 8, and Elhassan, 13, couldn't swim and were strapped in child seats.

He blamed the city, Honda, and Jiffy Lube and others for negligence.\n\n\"In short, there were functionally no precautionary measures taken by any public defendant to this action to prevent a car from plunging into the deep waters below the berth,\" a lawsuit filed in 2016 stated, CBS Los Angeles reported. \"This (also) included a lack of adequate signage or other such warnings to the public.\"\n\nHis lawsuit was tossed out.\n\nThe Los Angeles County district attorney declined to bring charges in the deaths because of insufficient evidence. A police mechanic found evidence that the brake pedal didn't properly work, but couldn't tell if that was the case before the tragedy or because of salt water corrosion.\n\nWhile a county prosecutor said the father's explanation could create reasonable doubt, they suggested police tell federal prosecutors about evidence of insurance and other fraud. Federal investigators said they found that Elmezayen spent about a quarter of his reported $24,000 salary to insure himself, his longtime partner and three sons for $6 million.\n\nElmezayen repeatedly called insurers to confirm they wouldn't automatically investigate a claim made more than two years after a policy was written, federal prosecutors said. The deadly plunge occurred two years and 12 days after the final policy took effect, authorities said.\n\nProsecutors argued that Elmezayen should not be free awaiting trial because he was likely to flee to his homeland. They also argued he still posed a danger to Diab because he had intended to kill her and still pays premiums on her life insurance policy and that of another son, who was at camp when his siblings were killed.\n\nA public defender representing Elmezayen argued that nothing had happened to Diab and the other son in over three years. He asked to have Elmezayen use $250,000 in equity in two houses he owns to secure his bond.\n\nElmezayen and Diab came to the U.S. in 2000 and overstayed their tourist visas, prosecutors said. Both married other partners in hopes of becoming permanent residents. Elmezayen has acknowledged his was a sham marriage.\n\nJudge Alka Sagar said Elmezayen lacked credibility and she denied bail, in part, because of what she called the \"ghastly scheme to obtain insurance benefits.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Holly Rosenkrantz", "title": "Graham says he supports bill to protect Mueller", "description": "Sen.

I mean, you think about my girls were being driven around in a motorcade of three cars with at least four grown adults with guns in each of those cars.

She also describes learning that she was not alone in wondering, \"am I good enough.\" Luckily for Obama, when that school counselor told her \"you're not Princeton material,\" she was armed with having been told the \"direct opposite\" of that for most of her life.\n\n\"I had grown up with love, and support, and encouragement, and high expectations. But here I walked into this room with a woman who really didn't know me, because it was a big high school, and she had to make a quick assessment. And her assessment could've been -- and I don't know -- was, 'Grade point average? Yeah, you're a good student. You know, your scores are good. You're black. You're here in this public school. Maybe you're stretching.' She didn't even know my brother went to Princeton. She didn't ask me any questions\u2026She didn't try to figure me out.

And everyone would raise their hand,\" she said.\n\nBut that self-doubt would creep in at various moments throughout her life -- perhaps most intensely while on the campaign trail with her husband.\n\n\"I write in Chapter 17....that chapter was probably one of the hardest for me to write. And it's the hardest, still, for me to read. Because it goes over a painful time in the campaign when I thought I was doing great telling my story, sharing it honestly.

CBS Pittsburgh, citing a statement from U.S. Attorney Scott Brady, reports that 30-year-old Jeffrey Clark made an appearance in a Washington, D.C. federal courtroom on Tuesday.\n\nClark is facing one federal count of unlawful possession of firearms by a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance, and one count in the District of Columbia of possessing high-capacity magazines.\n\nAccording to court papers, Clark was \"friends\" with the synagogue shooting suspect, Robert Bowers.\n\nClark was arrested after family members told police that he was having agitated outbursts, reportedly telling investigators that Clark said the shooting victims at the Tree of Life \"deserved it.\"\n\nInvestigators allege that Clark is a member of the same social networking site as Bowers, a website called Gab.\n\nAuthorities report that in the hours after the synagogue shooting, Clark's younger brother, Edward, went to an island in D.C. and shot and killed himself. CBS affiliate WUSA reports relatives told investigators that the brothers were involved in the alt-right movement and told them about the brothers' connection to Gab and the Pittsburgh shooter.\n\nUnited States Department of Justice\n\nRelatives told investigators both brothers were part of alt-right movements and that they became interested in guns because they thought there was going to be a civil war, according to court papers.\n\nAmong the posts investigators mention in the criminal complaint, is one which shows the Clark brothers posing with masks on in front of a flag with a skull and crossbones. There's also a superimposed photo of Dylann Roof, the mass murderer convicted of killing people inside a South Carolina church.\n\nAfter the shooting at the Tree of Life, authorities say Jeffrey Clark posted a picture of Bowers on Gab, and underneath it, the post reads in part: \"This was a dry run for things to come.\"\n\nFamily members told police that Clark defended the synagogue shooting suspect, and that he and his now deceased brother had allegedly fantasized about killing blacks and Jews, according to court papers.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, U.S. Attorney Scott Brady issued a statement reiterating that there's no evidence that anyone else had prior knowledge of the Tree of Life attack.\n\nHe goes on to say: \"The United States Attorney's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Pittsburgh want to assure the victims and the victims' families of the Tree of Life Synagogue attack that their safety is of paramount concern and that law enforcement continues to devote all available resources to the investigation and prosecution of this case.\"\n\nIn federal court Tuesday, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Magistrate Judge G.

The truce, announced Tuesday by Palestinian militant groups in the Gaza Strip, came after nearly two days of heavy shelling from both sides that had threatened to descend into full-blown war.\n\nGaza's Islamist Hamas rulers said they would abide by the ceasefire as long as Israel did the same. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was under intense pressure on Wednesday for accepting the truce -- including from his long-time defense chief who resigned his position and indicated a possible political challenge.\n\nIsrael's Home Front Command removed late Tuesday all limitations on southern residents, sending children back to school after two days in shelters.\n\nAt the United Nations Security Council held urgent consultations on Gaza Tuesday, and the U.N. Secretary-General's Deputy Spokesman Farhan Haq told CBS News' Pam Falk that the global body had worked \"very hard\" with Egypt \"to ensure that there is a return to the ceasefire arrangements of 2014.\"\n\nThe U.N.'s Special Coordinator for Middle East Peace Process, \"believes that it is possible to deescalate this current round of violence in the interest of both Palestinians and Israelis,\" Haq told CBS News.\n\nA diplomatic source close to the negotiations told Falk, however, that the \"situation remains very precarious and can blow up again.\"\n\nThe latest violence, which saw seven Gazans killed in 24 hours as the Israeli aerial bombardment flattened buildings and sent fireballs and plumes of smoke into the sky, was the worst between Israel and Palestinian militants since a 2014 war.\n\nSirens began sounding in southern Israel late Sunday, sending tens of thousands running for cover in shelters as around 460 rockets and mortar rounds were fired from Gaza, wounding 27 people, including three severely.\n\nA Palestinian labourer from the occupied West Bank was killed when a rocket hit a building in the Israeli city of Ashkelon.\n\nNetanyahu takes heat, faces challenge from hardliners\n\nNetanyahu was forced to defend his decision to abide by the truce on Wednesday, facing sharp criticism from some Israeli citizens and the resignation of his defense chief, all of whom saw the move as a contrition to Hamas.\n\nIsrael's hardline Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who made it clear on Tuesday that he did not support stopping the strikes, told lawmakers on Wednesday afternoon that he was resigning from his post and calling for early national elections. Lieberman officially announced his move later Wednesday in a televised address.\n\nHe called the acceptance of the truce \"a capitulation to terror.\"\n\nResidents in the Israeli border town of Sderot, which is regularly hit by rockets from Gaza during flareups, were irate that Israel's military was holding its fire.\n\n\"Our government is doing whatever it wants, that's it. It only let us suffer, nothing more. We are third class (citizens) here in Sderot and (so are) the communities at the border with Gaza, not only Sderot,\" resident David Maimon told The Associated Press. \"It's a shame instead of helping us, let us live quietly, they let us suffer. We only suffer, for 18 years we have been suffering.\"\n\nHerzl Zigzag, another Sderot resident, told the AP that he would \"never vote for Netanyahu.\"\n\n\"People here are traumatized. Gaza is victorious, what is this nonsense? It can't continue like this,\" he said.\n\nBut speaking later Wednesday at a ceremony to honor the founding father of Israel, David Ben-Gurion, Netanyahu said that, \"in times of emergency, when making decisions crucial to security, the public can't always be privy to the considerations that must be hidden from the enemy.\"\n\nREUTERS\n\n\"Our enemies begged for a ceasefire and they knew very well why.\"\n\nCeasefire quickly agreed with Egypt's help\n\nIn a statement issued late Tuesday, Egypt called on Israel to cease its \"military action\" in Gaza.\n\n\"Egypt's efforts have been able to achieve a ceasefire between the resistance and the Zionist enemy,\" the Gaza groups said.\n\nThe flare-up began on Sunday with a botched Israeli special forces operation inside the Gaza Strip that turned deadly and prompted Hamas to vow revenge.\n\nThe clash that resulted from the blown covert operation killed seven Palestinian militants, including a local Hamas military commander, as well as an Israeli army officer.\n\nPalestinian militants responded with rocket and mortar fire, as well as an anti-tank missile that hit a bus Hamas says was being used by Israeli soldiers. A soldier was severely wounded in the attack.\n\nSchools were closed in Gaza and in southern Israel on Tuesday as the two sides warned each other they would respond forcefully to any further violence.\n\nAfter an Israeli security cabinet meeting that reportedly lasted some six hours on Tuesday, a statement was issued saying the ministers \"instructed the (military) to continue its operations as necessary.\"\n\nMissile defences intercepted more than 100 rockets from Gaza and most others fell in open areas, though some hit houses and other civilian structures.\n\n\"Close call\" as rockets hit Southern Israel\n\nAshkelon is just eight miles from the Gaza border, and as CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported on Tuesday, that makes it an easy target for Palestinian rockets.\n\nD'Agata and his crew saw the aftermath on Tuesday of one of the Hamas rockets, which hit an Israeli house. It blew a hole in the living room wall, where a woman was watching TV when the warning siren rang out.\n\nShe begged her son to come with her to a reinforced safe room in the house, a move which may have saved both of their lives. Just minutes before the explosion, her son was in the shower.\n\n\"That's a close call,\" Baney told D'Agata.\n\n\"Within two seconds (after air sirens) we heard a huge boom, we saw our curtains flying in the air, windows (broken), and only after a few minutes when we went out, we realised that the missile had hit the building next to us,\" a man who lives near a block of flats hit by another rocket in Ashkelon said.\n\nIsrael hit back with major air strikes, with targets including Hamas's Al-Aqsa TV station and internal security headquarters in Gaza City.\n\nThe military said it struck some 160 targets in the enclave.\n\nIsraeli strikes \"like an earthquake\" in Gaza\n\n\"What happened was like an earthquake,\" said Abu Ayman Lemzeni, who lives near the targeted TV building.\n\nAt least five of the dead in Gaza were claimed as members of various militant groups. Some 26 other people were wounded in the Palestinian territory, according to Gaza's health ministry.\n\nThe escalation came despite Netanyahu's decision to allow Qatar to transfer millions of dollars in aid to Gaza for salaries as well as fuel to ease an electricity shortage.\n\nThe agreements had led to calmer protests along the Gaza border after months of deadly unrest.\n\nSunday's special forces operation and resulting clash upset those efforts, leading to questions over the timing of the covert Israeli move.\n\nIsrael said it was an intelligence-gathering operation and that those efforts must continue to defend the country.\n\nIsrael and Palestinian militants in Gaza have fought three wars since 2008, and protests and clashes along the Gaza border since March 30 have repeatedly raised fears of a fourth.\n\nAt least 234 Palestinians in Gaza have since been killed by Israeli fire, the majority during protests and clashes.\n\nTwo Israeli soldiers have been killed over the same period."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": "Bo Erickson and Rebecca Kaplan", "title": "Anti-Pelosi Democrats confident they can keep her from becoming House speaker again", "description": "Group of House members believes they can force Nancy Pelosi to drop out of the leadership race and make room for new faces", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/anti-pelosi-democrats-confident-they-can-keep-her-from-becoming-house-speaker-again/", "urlToImage": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/07/5097bbf4-f17e-4e58-bfb2-7eb7bfa1200c/thumbnail/1200x630/86e0c9c871e4ed4b3cbdfd01af01d7ac/gettyimages-1058424668.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T07:39:19Z", "content": "WASHINGTON -- Even as newly-elected members of the House arrived in Washington Wednesday for orientation, Democrats jockeyed behind the scenes in the battle over who the new House speaker should be.

They argue that the American people voted for new leadership in the midterm elections and don't want to see the same trio atop the party in the House that's been there for more than a decade.\n\nMoulton and the other lawmakers said they plan to release a letter with enough signatures of members and members-elect who are pledging not to vote for Pelosi that it would become clear she doesn't have 218 votes needed to be elected speaker on the House floor. He wouldn't reveal the number who have signed on so far because, he said, more are signing on by the day.\n\nMoulton said he and his allies are bolstered by at least seven members-elect he who have made firm promises not to vote for Pelosi.\n\n\"The whole point of the letter is to accelerate this process so that it doesn't spill out onto the floor. \u2026 We want to make it clear before it comes to that that she should step aside,\" Moulton said Tuesday. \"We're trying to do the right thing for the party by solving this ahead of time.\"\n\nMoulton has pledged not to run for leadership but said he believes several lawmakers will put their names forward if Pelosi can't win. The group isn't backing or putting forward an alternative to Pelosi; their sole aim is to ensure she's not elected speaker.\n\nCritics of the anti-Pelosi group say it's wrong to try to kick out the highest-ranking woman in Congress in a year that saw hundreds of women run for office and dozens win.\n\n\"I think every single one of us that are part of this effort to forge new leadership are very mindful of the fact that women form a large part of our caucus,\" Rep. Filemon Vela, D-Texas, who opposes Pelosi, told reporters, \"It's difficult to say now but I think every single one of us are motivated to ensure that we have a woman leading the caucus.\"\n\nPelosi's backers are also working to prove she has the necessary support among caucus members. Reps. Rosa DeLauro, D-Ct., is working on a letter from female lawmakers to show their support for the leader.\n\n\"We took the House of Representatives back. It was one individual who worked with many others but as the leader made it happen,\" she told reporters. \"There would not have been an Affordable Care Act without Nancy Pelosi. I was there on economic recovery and we wouldn't have done that. Major, major pieces of legislation that got passed because of the strength of her knowledge, her experience, and the gut about what are the values of this country and what do we need to do. Therefore, she deserves to be speaker of the House.\"\n\nOther backers argue that there's plenty of fresh perspective in the Democratic leadership sitting just below the current trio of Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, D-Md., and Jim Clyburn, D-SC.\n\n\"We're going to have a new generation of leadership. That is going to happen,\" said Rep.

In his opening remarks, the prosecutor told the jury of seven women and five men in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn this is a case about drugs, money, violence, prison escapes and billions of dollars involved in a criminal enterprise.\n\nGuzman seated at the defense table, flanked by his attorneys and assisted by an interpreter, appeared to listen with rapt attention as prosecutor Adam Fels outlined the government's case against him.\n\nGuzman, 61, has pleaded not guilty to charges involving international drug trafficking, conspiracy to murder, gun and money laundering charges. He faces life in prison if convicted of all charges.\n\nFels told the jury that Guzman earned nearly $14 billion as the kingpin of the powerful Sinaloa drug cartel \u2014 using planes, trains, automobiles and even submarines \u2014 to move hundreds of tons of Colombian cocaine into Mexico before shipping it to the United States for distribution.\n\nJane Rosenberg\n\nHe said Guzman shipped so much cocaine into the United States that every citizen would have their own \"line\" of it.\n\nFels said Guzman had his own personal army- and hit squad and carried a diamond-encrusted handgun and a gold AK-47.\n\nThe defense denied Guzman was a drug kingpin. In his opening statement, Defense attorney Jeffrey Lichtman said Guzman was \"more myth than actual legend ...\"\n\n\"They claim he's the biggest drug dealer in the history of the world. It's false. Not true,\" Lichtman told the jurors.\n\nHe said the prosecution was going to be calling \"so called\" cooperating witnesses- \"people who will make your skin crawl when they testify.\"\n\nLichtman called those potential prosecution witnesses \"gutter human beings.\" He said a Guzman conviction would be the \"biggest prize\" for prosecutors.\n\nGuzman's wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, was seated in the rear of courtroom which was packed with reporters, attorneys and spectators.\n\nGuzman craned his neck to look for her as he was escorted into the courtroom by US Marshals. He stood and waved to her with a beaming smile. He was wearing a dark suit, white starched shirt and blue striped tie.\n\nSecurity was tight the courthouse with double layer of metal detectors, one at the entrance and the other on the eighth floor, used to screen everyone entering the courtroom. Outside the building were scores of police, heavy armored vehicles and K-9 units.\n\nThe trial continues Wednesday before Federal Judge Brian Cogan.

What that means is that we can't fight traditionally, the way we have fought,\" he said.\n\nThe commission identified a set of six trends it said had fundamentally altered the strategic environment now facing the United States:\n\nThe return of major-power competition from authoritarian powers like Russia and China;\n\n\n\nThe rise and expanded military capabilities of aggressive regional challengers like Iran and North Korea;\n\n\n\nEvolving and intensifying threats from jihadist groups;\n\n\n\nRising \"gray-zone\" aggression, which includes strong-arm diplomacy and economic coercion, media manipulation and cyberattacks, paramilitary and proxy forces;\n\n\n\nProliferation of advanced technology \u2013 hypersonics and AI, for instance \u2013 that is eroding U.S. advantages and creating new vulnerabilities;\n\n\n\nAnd political dysfunction \u2013 budgetary instability and reduced defense investment.\n\n\n\n\"We have basically been underfunding the Defense Department for quite a period of time,\" Edelman said. \"I think there's been a disposition to believe that we spend so much money on defense [that] we should be able to deal with all comers. But what I think people have lost sight of is that the international environment has just become so much more complicated.\"\n\nThe commission called for an increase in the defense budget of between 3-5 percent above inflation, or else \"DOD should alter the expectations of the strategy and America's global strategic objectives.\"\n\nThe report also recommended an independent commission be appointed to review U.S. cyber policy. \"It is painfully clear that America is not competing or deterring its adversaries as effectively as it should in cyberspace,\" the report said.\n\n\"We've got to match the kind of intellectual firepower they're bringing to the problem with that kind of firepower of our own,\" Edelman told Morell.\n\nPrevious defense strategy reviews had already issued warnings that America was risking national security crises if it did not better maintain or, in some cases, immediately bolster its military and operational capabilities.\n\nThe 2018 commission said, however, that it believed America had already \"reached the point of a full-blown national security crisis.\"\n\n\"In this report,\" Edelman said, \"I think what we had to wrestle with was the consequences of all those warnings having been ignored.\"\n\nThe Defense Department said in a statement that it welcomed the release of the report and said it had \"engaged extensively with the Commission throughout its deliberations.\" It said that the report's description of the security environment faced by the U.S. is \"a stark reminder of the gravity of these issues, and a call to action.\" The Defense Department's statement went on to say it would \"carefully consider each of the recommendations put forward by the Commission as part of continuing efforts to strengthen our nation's defense.\n\nThe commission's co-chairs will testify about their findings before the Senate and House Armed Services Committees about the report's contents later this month."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Family of 4 arrested in grisly slayings of 8 people in rural Ohio", "description": "A family of four was arrested Tuesday in the gruesome slayings of eight people from another family in rural southern Ohio two years ago.

He ran the Memphis Noticias online news outlet and reported on the effects of U.S. immigration policies in the Hispanic community. Duran's lawyers have said he came to the U.S. without permission in 2006 after receiving death threats related to reporting on corruption in El Salvador.\n\n\"It's dangerous for me to return to my country,\" he said in Spanish during a conference call.\n\nDuran had been critical of law enforcement in his reporting. Activists say he faced retaliation for it. Memphis police have repeatedly denied those allegations, saying officers arrested Duran after an order to clear the street was given.\n\nDuran said he was just doing his job as a journalist when he was arrested.\n\n\"I was doing the right thing,\" he said.\n\nIn October, the Board of Immigration Appeals in Virginia denied an appeal in the case. Duran's lawyer, Michelle Lapointe, said he could be deported within two weeks if the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta does not agree to delay his removal and reopen his deportation case. A ruling is pending.\n\nLapointe, who works with the Southern Poverty Law Center, said she will ask for asylum for Duran if the court does agree to open his case because reporters are facing worsening conditions in El Salvador.\n\nDuran was issued a deportation order in 2007 after he failed to show up for court. His lawyers have said that he did not receive notice to report to court before the deportation order was issued.\n\nAfter Duran's April 3 arrest, disorderly conduct and obstruction of a highway charges were dropped. Authorities in Memphis then handed him over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\n\"We would not be in this situation if he had not been targeted for exercising his First Amendment rights reporting the news that was critical of local policies and ICE policies that harmed his community,\" Lapointe said.\n\nDuran was transferred from Memphis to an ICE facility in Louisiana. Duran said he has experienced poor conditions, including bad food and dirty bathrooms with no toilet paper, in ICE facilities in Louisiana.\n\nICE spokesman Bryan Cox denied Duran's allegations. Cox said the facility where Duran is being held in Jena, Louisiana, has been inspected by multiple groups and has passed inspection.\n\nDuran's lawyers have sought his release from ICE custody as they fight his deportation. Duran's longtime partner, Melisa Valdez, said the past months without Duran have been \"a nightmare.\"\n\nShe said Duran is not a criminal and is not a danger to the Memphis community.\n\n\"His arrest and detainment only show the government has displaced priorities,\" Valdez said during the conference call. \"I find it extremely unfair that someone can be jailed indefinitely without committing a crime.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Brothers conquer Ironman triathlons together despite one's cerebral palsy", "description": "Kyle Pease has cerebral palsy, but that doesn't stop him from competing in Ironman competitions with his brother Brent.

More than 40 percent of the population is undernourished \u2014 up to 10.3 million people don't get enough to eat, according to the World Food Programme. And the political, social and health consequences of the famine a generation ago still linger today.\n\nSevere food shortages in the mid-1990s devastated the country. Some 3 million people died, and many others barely survived on a diet of contraband grain or watery gruel.\n\nThere were a number of causes for the famine: Poor weather damaged already limited crops, and economic mismanagement and the end of fuel subsidies further disrupted food distribution. The result was a situation so severe that its impact is still being felt, according to Daniel Jong Schwekendiek a professor at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul who has researched nutrition in North Korea.\n\n\"The food crisis led to the marketization of the North Korean economy that continues until today,\" Jong Schwekendiek said an email. \"As the public distribution system collapsed, people started to engage in the informal economy, including livestock breeding, smuggling, street vending.\"\n\nLong after the worst of the famine, North Koreans continue to bear its marks. Through his research, Jong Schwekendiek found that contemporary South Korean preschool children are up to 3 kilograms (about 6 and a half pounds) heavier than North Korean preschoolers. South Korean women on average weigh 4 to 9 kilograms (8.8 to 19.9 pounds) more than their peers in the North.\n\nHandout / Getty Images\n\nThose differences are the result of \"socio-economic living conditions,\" he said, not any genetic differences between the populations north and south of the Demilitarized Zone.\n\n\"The Korean peninsula has been a homogenous nation for centuries,\" he explained. \"North Korean adults were slightly taller than South Koreans before the division of the Korean peninsula, further suggesting that differing political systems in the two Koreas have caused this shift.\"\n\nAccording to a study published by Sunyoung Pak of Seoul National University in 2010, North Korean children who were born in the late 90s, during the peak of the food shortages, were shorter than those born before and after. The disparity was greatest among those in the mid-teen years.\n\nFor North Korean children who escape to South Korea, their weight catches up within two years. As for their height, that depends on when the child enters South Korea and what diet they are exposed to, according to Lee Soo-kyung, nutrition professor at Inha University in South Korea.\n\n\"To me, they [North Korean children] are forced to suffer twice for something beyond their control: malnutrition during childhood and chronic diseases during their adulthood,\" she said.\n\nDamir Sagolj / Reuters\n\nIn recent years, nutritional conditions in North Korea have improved. The number of North Korean children under the age of 5 suffering from stunting, or short stature resulting from chronic malnutrition, has fallen to about 19 percent, according to UNICEF, down from 28 percent in 2012. But that still leaves 1 in 5 North Korean children under 5 years old stunted.\n\nAnd the gains are not distributed equally around the country. Life in the capital, Pyongyang, presents the most flagrant example of inequality. Those in Pyongyang live quite comfortably compared to the rest of North Korea, and malnutrition is far less common. Stunting affects 10 percent of children in Pyongyang, compared to 32 percent of those in rural Ryanggang considered moderately or severely stunted, according to a UNICEF report published last summer.\n\n\"Although the rate of malnutrition decreased in North Korea, there are still a large number of children malnourished,\" Soo-kyung said. \"For example, Hamgyeong province still showed 'high' level of chronic malnutrition status.\"\n\nOnly 17 percent of North Korea's land is fit for agricultural production and the country still heavily relies on traditional farming methods. Weather patterns have also increased droughts and floods, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Basic necessities such as clean drinking water and basic sanitation are also limited for those in rural areas.\n\nDamir Sagolj / Reuters\n\nPolitical tensions are further worsening the situation. Although humanitarian aid is exempt from international sanctions, they have slowed down aid deliveries and created challenges for the shipment of basic humanitarian supplies, according to OCHA.\n\n\"The absence of a banking channel for humanitarian transfers is one of the unintended consequences of the international sanctions,\" said Russell Geekie, a spokesperson for OCHA.\n\nFewer aid workers are able to go to North Korea due to a U.S. ban on citizens traveling there, further stalling relief efforts.\n\nUNICEF said last January that 60,000 North Korean children could starve due to the impact of international sanctions.\n\n\"There's just too much that undermines these efforts,\" said a longtime aid worker who requested anonymity. \"Sending food is a Band-aid \u2014 it's not the solution. We're just putting Band-aids on a difficult situation.\"\n\nFunding for North Korean aid has dropped significantly, to $31.8 million in 2018 so far, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs' Financial Tracking Service \u2014 down from $117.8 million in 2012. Currently, the 2018 appeal for North Korea is only 24 percent funded.\n\nAmong the countries sending aid to North Korea is South Korea, which pledged $8 million through the United Nations for \"poor conditions children and pregnant women face there, apart from political issues,\" South Korea's Minister of Unification, Cho Myung-gyon said in September 2017."}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "Amazon picks New York and Virginia for second headquarters", "description": "There's a winner in Amazon's nationwide contest for a second headquarters.

Even though their school is in Tokyo and the students born in Japan, the lesson has a distinctive North Korean perspective to it.\n\nAt Korea University, located in the suburbs of the Japanese capital, the 600 or so students are taught that North Korea is their only ally and strongest supporter.\n\n\"This is a really great period for North Korea. It's a good period for us, better than any other time,\" student Ha Minee told CBS News.\n\nSince Korea University's opening in 1957, North Korea has funded the school. Portraits of late North Korean leaders line the walls, and Japan has essentially no control over the curriculum. Korea University is just one of about 60 North Korean schools in Japan.\n\nAccording to Kiho Park, an ethnic Korean based in Osaka who studied in North Korea-funded schools, students were often taught aggression towards the U.S.\n\n\"We learned history of how DPRK\" \u2014 the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the formal name of the North \u2014 \"defeated U.S. Army, and how to make revolution, like fighting,\" he said.\n\nCBS News\n\nJapan has one of the biggest communities of Koreans abroad; around 500,000 registered foreign national residents in Japan are from the Koreas, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, and some estimates range as high as 1 million. Though many of these families have lived in Japan for generations, they maintain Korean cultural traditions and a loyalty to their heritage.\n\nDuring Japan's colonization of the Korean peninsula in the early 1900s, ethnic Koreans were considered Japanese nationals and were brought in for cheap labor. After World War II ended, about three-quarters of Koreans returned home; another 600,000 remained in Japan. During this time, all residents in Japan who were non-Japanese had to undergo alien registration. Unwelcome in Japan, Koreans endured discrimination and poverty and were often denied basic rights. Even today, Koreans in Japan are treated as second-class citizens.\n\nBut why do so many feel closer to the North than the South? From 1955-1960, following the Korean War, Chongryon, a pro-North Korea organization in Japan, was more effective in organizing the Korean community. Chongryon members convinced some Koreans in Japan to move to North Korea, despite staying behind themselves. For many there wasn't much of a choice, since South Korea was unwilling to take in returnees.\n\nFor years, North Korea attempted to lure Koreans in Japan to relocate, promising that a better life awaited them \u2014 a promise at odds with the bleak and impoverished reality of life in the so-called Hermit Kingdom. Between 1959 and 1984, an estimated 90,000 Koreans from Japan were repatriated to North Korea. Many returnees fell victim to political purges in the 1970s, or vanished into labor camps.\n\nYet the North retained a hold on Korean loyalties in Japan by emphasizing that the South had abandoned them decades ago, while the North regularly sent aid, mostly to fund schools.\n\nChongryon runs the schools, which range from kindergarten to university level. North Korea sent money to Chongryon to fund the schools regularly until the 1980s, and then in intervals.\n\nCBS News\n\nThe schools forge a tight relationship with the motherland. Inside Korea University there's even a museum with over 500 artifacts from the North. According to history professor Ha Chang Gun, \"We want them to say yes, we feel like this is ours.\"\n\nPachinko gaming parlor owner Sejun Ko's roots are in South Korea, but his loyalty is with the North.\n\n\"It's like the love between a parent and child,\" he said of North Korea's relationship with Koreans in Japan. \"My parents felt I needed to know the Korean language and history so I went to a North Korean school from elementary school to university.\"\n\nHe works in an industry dominated by Koreans. Gaming parlors featuring pinball-like pachinko machines are a popular form of entertainment and a multi-billion dollar industry in Japan.\n\nBut the schools where Koreans in Japan learned love for the North and hostility to the West may be losing their foothold. The Associated Press reports attendance has been shrinking as the birthrate declines and more people assimilate or take South Korean citizenship.\n\nThe lessons they're teaching are changing, too. For current students at Korea University, it's an exciting moment for North Korea due to President Trump's apparent affection for Kim Jong Un and the historic summit between the two leaders last June.\n\n\"The idea that the leaders of the two countries could meet, embrace, hold hands was historic and previously unthinkable,\" Ha Minee said.\n\nWhen CBSN Originals correspondent Adam Yamaguchi visited Japan recently, optimism regarding North Korea's changing place in the world was present all around.\n\n\"The main objective of the summit wasn't economic, but it was about bringing an end to the war, reunification,\" Ko said. \"If that is achieved, things will\u2026 explosively change, and the economic changes will come as a result as well.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbs-news", "name": "CBS News"}, "author": null, "title": "17 midterm races are still uncalled", "description": "The 2018 midterms aren't over yet.

There's a North Korean art scene flourishing bey\u2026 [+6072 chars]", "fulltext": "Stream the new CBSN Originals documentary, \"North Korea: The Art of Surviving Sanctions,\" in the video player above.\n\nThere's a North Korean art scene flourishing beyond propaganda posters and far from the country's rigid borders \u2014 a scene that can be found in Florence, Italy, the cradle of the Renaissance.\n\nHere, in the city that nurtured Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, Italian art dealer Pier Luigi Cecioni shows off the hundreds of paintings that he's imported from North Korea.\n\n\"We buy these as a company, and then we organize exhibitions and then we try to sell the works,\" he said. Cecioni and his brother Eugenio Cecioni have one of the biggest collections of North Korean art in Europe. They say they acquired the collection before U.N. sanctions were imposed in 2006, stalling North Korea's exports.\n\nAll of these works originated from Mansudae Art Studio, North Korea's massive state-run arts enterprise, based in Pyongyang. Founded in 1959, Mansudae turns out oil paintings, sculptures, portraits, embroideries and landscapes. With 4,000 employees, it is the largest art studio in North Korea, and perhaps even the largest of its kind in the world.\n\nKCNA via AFP/Getty Images\n\nMansudae ensures that North Korean culture and an idealized view of North Korean life is disseminated far and wide, and Cecioni's gallery is an example. Hanging on Cecioni's gallery walls is not just propaganda, but also lighter scenes: paintings illustrating workers with beaming smiles, and soccer players from the 1966 World Cup match where North Korea beat Italy, considered one of the greatest upsets in World Cup history. In another painting, which Cecioni refers to as a \"little strange,\" a herd of goats surrounds a happy family.\n\nAn expert on North Korean art, Georgetown Professor B.G. Muhn, said that the socialist realism of North Korean art has a \"naive, melodramatic quality. That we can't see in contemporary art.\"\n\nCBS News\n\n\"When you look at North Korean art, especially at first, you are struck by the difference it has with other art and the propaganda,\" Cecioni said. \"Even though it's not all propaganda, of course. In large part it's just landscapes, portraits.\"\n\nCecioni, who said he's visited North Korea at least 10 times, began cultivating his relationship with North Korea's art studio back in 2005. The asking price for his pieces range from a couple of hundred dollars for posters to thousands for more valuable pieces, and he said the propaganda pieces are his best sellers. Pyongyang-based artists have also visited Cecioni in Italy, he said.\n\nCecioni said the Mansudae facility reminds him of an American campus. \"There is a soccer field, there is a place for the children, but people do not live there, people go there to work,\" he said.\n\nOver the years, according to Cecoini, the situation in North Korea has visibility improved, noting that now there are far more cars on the roads. He emphasizes that things don't appear to be so bad. \"I do not have the feeling that the people around me are starving or that they are afraid or that they are doing things because if they don't do them they go to jail,\" he said, though it should be noted that the North Korean regime tightly controls what foreign visitors can do and see in the country.\n\nIn Beijing, Ji Zhengtai, a Chinese-North Korean businessman, maintains a gallery which he refers to as Mansudae's official studio abroad.\n\nCBS News\n\n\"These are art pieces; they are not military weapons,\" he said. Ji insists that North Korea has no control over his gallery, Mansudae Art Gallery, and that he owns more than a thousand works.\n\nHe is happy to show off the collection \u2014 like a painting of a tiger whose eyes seem to follow you across the room. But when asked about finances, and whether money is filtered back to North Korea, Ji mostly dodges the question. He also refrains from discussing artwork as a commodity. \"It is vulgar to talk about it this way,\" he said. \"When I started out I did have making money in mind. But after time, I liked the art more and more; my collection became bigger and bigger.\"\n\nNorth Korea's repressive authoritarian regime has been under international sanctions since 2006, when it carried out its first nuclear and ballistic missile tests. A growing list of sanctions restricted trade and choked off access to foreign currency. But through the Mansudae Overseas Project, a part of Mansudae Art Studio continued to help rake in cash for the regime.\n\nIn August 2017, sanctions specifically targeted Mansudae. According to the U.N. report, Mansudae Overseas Project \"engaged in, facilitated, or was responsible for the exportation of workers from the DPRK [North Korea] to other nations for construction-related activities including for statues and monuments to generate revenue for the Government of the DPRK or the Workers' Party of Korea.\" Due to sanctions, a travel ban was set on Mansudae, and their global assets were frozen.\n\nBut years of work by Mansudae not only succeeded in bringing many millions of dollars back to North Korea, it also helped build relationships with other countries around the world.\n\nMansudae has projects in at least 15 countries, but its most lucrative relationship has been with Africa. Enormous bronze monuments throughout the continent brought in an estimated $260 million as of 2016. A North Korean construction firm built the African Renaissance Monument in Dakar, Senegal, which cost Senegal $27 million \u2014 a huge sum for the impoverished nation. At a 160 feet tall, it is the largest monument in Africa.\n\nThe project seems to have brought North Korea more than just much-needed currency. As the monument's director, Georges Diatta, told us, it also brought goodwill.\n\n\"If the Senegalese government accept North Korean society to build this monument, it was because they have got a good relationship,\" Diatta said."}]
