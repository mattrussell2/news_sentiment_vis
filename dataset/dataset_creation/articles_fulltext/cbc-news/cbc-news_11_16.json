He also pleaded guilty to four other charges, including robbery while using a prohibited or restricted weapon and wearing a mask or disguise to commit an offence.\n\nIn June, co-accused Laylin Delorme was convicted on two counts of first-degree murder. He is scheduled to be sentenced next month.\n\nThe third man charged, Colton Steinhauer, faces a double first-degree murder trial scheduled for April 2019.\n\nThe judge noted Friday there was no evidence presented at trial about the nature of the teen's relationship to the two older men, or how he got involved in the robberies. Shelley also said she heard no evidence about any discussions that took place among the trio between the first and second robberies. She said there was no proof beyond a reasonable doubt that G.S. walked into the second store with the idea of committing murder.\n\nSurveillance video shows G.S. had his back turned when Bhangu was shot. The judge said it's possible the teen did not know the shots hit the clerk. Video from the second store shows G.S. had already left the store when Cenabre was shot.\n\n\"I have considerable doubt about his involvement in the planning of the robberies,\" Shelley said. \"Given his age ... I cannot accept that his continued participation by entering the second Mac's store 15 minutes later was the result of a carefully thought out analysis.\"\n\nSentencing date still to be set\n\nUnder the Youth Criminal Justice Act, the maximum penalty for manslaughter is three years in custody. G.S. has been in custody since he was arrested on Dec. 18, 2015, a few hours after the robberies.\n\nOutside court, defence lawyer Akram Attia said he plans to argue that G.S. should get credit for time already served. That could mean the teen would be released from custody soon after he is sentenced.\n\nDefence lawyers Akram Attia and Jacqueline Leblanc say they will now focus on preparing for the sentencing hearing. (Janice Johnston/CBC News )\n\nA date for sentencing will be set on Dec. 7.\n\nAttia said he hopes his young client will be able to turn his life around.\n\n\"He's a young man that's lost the formative years of his life being in custody,\" Attia said. \"We're trying to get him to reconnect with some older family members that I think will be a very positive influence moving forward.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Sarah Petz", "title": "Rogers denies encouraging radio host Dave Wheeler to be controversial on the air", "description": "Winnipeg radio host Dave Wheeler lost his job after repeated warnings, training and a suspension due to his behaviour \u2014 including an incident in 2017 where he allegedly \"attacked\" a colleague and his station \u2014 according to a statement of defence filed by his \u2026", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/dave-wheeler-lawsuit-rogers-defence-1.4909815", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3531673.1460467027!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/dave-wheeler-of-wheeler-in-the-morning.jpeg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T23:40:37Z", "content": "Winnipeg radio host Dave Wheeler lost his job after repeated warnings, training and a suspension due to his behaviour including an incident in 2017 where he allegedly \"attacked\" a colleague and his station according to a statement of defence filed by his form\u2026 [+3707 chars]", "fulltext": "Winnipeg radio host Dave Wheeler lost his job after repeated warnings, training and a suspension due to his behaviour \u2014 including an incident in 2017 where he allegedly \"attacked\" a colleague and his station \u2014 according to a statement of defence filed by his former employer.\n\nWheeler was fired in July from his position as host of Wheeler in the Morning on 92 CITI FM, a station owned by Rogers Media, for his part in an on-air conversation about actor Scarlett Johansson pulling out of the upcoming film Rub and Tug.\n\nHe filed a $1.4-million lawsuit against his former employer in September, which suggested Rogers encouraged Wheeler to be \"edgy\" and \"controversial.\"\n\nIn its statement of defence, filed on Nov. 5, Rogers said Wheeler was told from the beginning of his employment that he was to be \"selective\" in his comments \"and was specifically coached as to acceptable and unacceptable commentary on air.\"\n\nRogers also denied Wheeler's allegations that he was encouraged to be controversial on air.\n\n\"He was entitled to be goofy, loud, raucous and rumbustious but not to be editorially 'controversial,'\" the statement of defence said.\n\n\"In any event, it was made clear to to the plaintiff repeatedly that he was not to conduct himself in the manner which led to his dismissal.\"\n\nDisciplined for 2017 incident\n\nIn addition to being disciplined in 2016, with a one-day suspension over his part in two videos that embodied racist and sexist stereotypes, Wheeler was also reprimanded for an incident that happened in August 2017, according to court documents filed by Rogers.\n\nIn its statement of defence, the company says that on Aug. 18, 2017, the final day of his television program, he \"attacked\" a colleague and the station, released confidential information and complained his ideas were censored.\n\nHe received a written warning on Sept. 15, 2017, for misconduct in that incident.\n\nWheeler and his legal counsel, Matthew Duffy, filed a response to Rogers' defence on Nov. 8, which denied Wheeler was reprimanded by the station for his behaviour, other than agreeing to keep him off the air for a time due to the controversy surrounding the videos he was involved in.\n\n\"At no time was Wheeler punished, admonished, or reprimanded whatsoever for the videos, but rather received praise from Rogers,\" the reply says.\n\nFurther, Wheeler's reply argues that \"at all times leading up to his termination, he received positive feedback, praise, and general support from Rogers.\"\n\nFired after comments about transgender community\n\nWheeler was fired after he took issue on air with the pressure put on Johansson to withdraw from a film.

And they pretend to be a dog. It is not right to agree with them for the sake of their feelings,\" said an image of the conversation that was posted online.\n\nRogers signed Wheeler to a five-year contract on Sept. 15, 2012. He was to get a $7,500 signing bonus and start with an annual salary of $255,000 that would increase by $5,000 each year over the term of the contract, plus semi-annual $10,000 ratings bonuses.\n\nHe signed a second, five-year contract with Rogers in August 2017 \u2014 about 16 months after he was suspended in 2016. His wage jumped to $335,000 per year, plus a one-time $100,000 signing bonus, according to court documents.\n\nIn its statement of defence, Rogers also disputed Wheeler's claim in his lawsuit that he was recruited by the media company.\n\nThe company claims that Wheeler was actually \"anxious\" to join Rogers as his contract with a competing company was almost up.\n\n\"His interview was for a position in Vancouver,\" the statement says.\n\n\"He was unsuccessful in obtaining that position but was then offered a position in Winnipeg which he accepted with alacrity, not having any other alternative.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "World Series MVP Pearce re-signs with Red Sox", "description": "World Series MVP Steve Pearce is staying with the Red Sox.

She sent the teen back to the Waterville youth jail in the Annapolis Valley where he's already spent 12 days since he surrendered to police.\n\nBeach was the judge who originally granted the bail and she made it clear she took the teen's breach seriously.\n\n\"He didn't go out and grab a piece of pizza and come home,\" the judge said. \"This was a deliberate absconding.\"\n\nJudge challenges defence lawyers\n\nBeach also challenged defence lawyers on their arguments that his actions were driven by trauma.\n\n\"There's no evidence before me in this case of any trauma,\" she said.\n\nShe also challenged why, if he was in such distress, those people around him hadn't sought help before he ran away.\n\nBeach will give her decision on bail on Nov. 26.

Sign up here to get it delivered directly to your inbox every weekday.\n\nHere's what you need to know right now from the world of sports:\n\nThe Penguins are in last place. Hard to believe, but look at the low end of the NHL's Eastern Conference standings:\n\nPittsburgh hit bottom last night after a 4-3 home loss to Tampa Bay. The 2016 and '17 Stanley Cup champs have lost seven of their last eight while being outscored by 12 goals in that span. The Lightning's Brayden Point scored a hat trick in 91 seconds of game time (all on the power play, two of them at 5-on-3) and Sidney Crosby sat out with an \"upper-body injury.\" Coach Mike Sullivan said it's not a concussion but suggested Crosby could miss a week. Pittsburgh will probably be fine \u2014 its plus-1 goal differential is better than Montreal's, and the Habs are fourth in the East. Oh, and the Pens still have 65 games left. Way too early to panic.\n\nThe Italian government will chip in for the 2026 Olympics after all. Deputy Premier Luigi Di Maio said last month that the government \"won't provide one Euro\" to the Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo bid. So why the change of heart? Probably didn't hurt that Calgary all but dropped out of the race this week when its citizens voted \"no\" to pursuing the Games. That left only the Italians and Stockholm as finalists. The former has to be considered the front-runner now. Even before this new federal support, the Milan-Cortina bid had financial backing from the regional governments of Lombardy and Veneto \u2014 two of Italy's wealthiest. Stockholm, meanwhile, is trying to pull this off without taxpayer funding. The winner will be announced in June.\n\nHouston pulled the plug on Carmelo Anthony. Rockets GM Daryl Morey announced yesterday the team is \"parting ways\" with the 10-time all-star after only 10 games. Houston reportedly had no immediate plans to cut him, and NBA rules say he can't be traded until Dec. 15. So it could take awhile for 'Melo to find a new team. The 34-year-old is a polarizing figure among basketball fans. Some consider him a star, others think he's overrated. The No. 3 pick in the 2003 NBA draft (LeBron James was already off the board, but Denver could have picked Dwyane Wade or Chris Bosh), Anthony has never been able to help his teams go deeper than the conference finals.\n\nBaseball is trying to be more colourful. Starting next season, players will be allowed more freedom in the colours and designs of their cleats. This is partly a response to the criticism Major League Baseball got for prohibiting the Cubs' Ben Zobrist from wearing black cleats (as a tribute to old-time players) and Cleveland's Mike Clevinger from sporting a tie-dyed pattern and a drawing of Jimi Hendrix. So good job, baseball. That should make the game more fun. Now maybe do something about the endless pitching changes and the ball never being in play anymore.\n\nExcuse me while I kiss these shoes. (Ed Zurga/Getty Images)\n\nHere's your weekend viewing guide\n\nThe weekend is here. That means a lot of sports. This is what you should watch:\n\nFriday night\n\nNBA \u2014 Raptors at Celtics (7 p.m. ET). This was supposed to be the Celtics' year. They made a surprise run to the Eastern Conference final last spring despite being without two of their star players in Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving. With those guys back and second-year man Jayson Tatum emerging as a star, Boston was the pre-season favourite to win the East. But the Celtics are just 8-6 and Hayward hasn't looked like the same player he was before a gruesome lower-leg injury sidelined him for basically all of last season. Toronto, meanwhile, is 12-3 since acquiring Kawhi Leonard over the summer, though the Raptors have lost two in a row.\n\nSaturday morning/afternoon\n\nFigure skating \u2014 Grand Prix of Russia. Yuzuru Hanyu is the best figure skater in the world and he's on his way to becoming one of the best ever. Only 23, he's already got two Olympic gold medals and a pair of world titles. Watch the Japanese star perform his free skate in Moscow, where he's already built up a massive lead with a dazzling short program. If you're up early, CBCSports.ca is streaming the men's free skate live, starting at 5:30 a.m. ET. Or sleep in and catch it on CBC's Road to the Olympic Games show at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nSaturday night\n\nNHL \u2014 Montreal at Vancouver (7 p.m. ET). These were supposed to be two of the NHL's worst teams this season, but they're both holding down a playoff position at this (very) early stage. Montreal is third in the Atlantic Division and Vancouver is second in the Pacific. The Habs' Max Domi has been a big surprise with 23 points in 19 games after coming over in a trade from Arizona. Canucks rookie Elias Pettersson is one of the most talked-about players in the league and already has 10 goals in 15 games.\n\nSunday\n\nCFL \u2014 Division Finals (1 p.m. ET and 4:30 p.m. ET). The winners of these two games will meet for the Grey Cup next Sunday in Edmonton. The early game is the East final: Hamilton at Ottawa. The Redblacks are 3.5-point favourites and well rested after a bye week, but the Tiger-Cats are coming off a 48-8 thrashing of B.C. Out in the West, Calgary is favoured by five points and remains most people's pick to win the Grey Cup after losing the title game two years in a row. This could be the Stamps' year: they had the best regular-season record (13-5) and gave up by far the fewest points. Winnipeg, which got past Saskatchewan last week, also has a strong defence and scored the most points. The winner of this matchup will be favoured to take the Grey Cup.\n\nMonday night\n\nNFL \u2014 Chiefs at Rams (8:15 p.m. ET). We're cheating here (Monday is the exact opposite of the weekend) but this one's just too good not to mention. Two of the NFL's three best teams (New Orleans is the other) and its two top offences square of in what could be a Super Bowl preview (if we're lucky). Expect a lot of scoring. This game was supposed to be played in Mexico City until poor field conditions prompted the NFL to move it to the Rams' stadium, tilting it in L.A.'s favour.\n\nYou're up to speed.

Each year, a week after Remembrance Day, they mark the life and death of Tara Singh Hayer, shot dead in his garage on Nov. 18, 1998.\n\nTara Singh Hayer receiving the Order of B.C. in 1995. (CBC)\n\nWhen the bullets hit him, Hayer, the publisher of a Punjabi-language newspaper in Surrey, B.C., was struggling to get out of his specially-designed car and into his wheelchair. He'd been disabled by a previous murder attempt 10 years earlier.\n\nThis weekend, the 20th anniversary of his death arrives with the crime still officially unsolved. Nobody's paid a penalty for it. His family's anger still seems fresh.\n\n'An incentive to kill the witness'\n\nAs Hayer's son Dave sees it, Canada's justice system allowed his father's killers to achieve their purpose. He said he's still appalled by the fact that, during the Air India trial \u2014 which ended in acquittals in 2005 \u2014 the elder Hayer's account of what he called a confession by one of the accused was ruled inadmissible as evidence.\n\nA former B.C. Liberal MLA who's now retired from politics, Dave Hayer argues Canada's laws \"protect the criminal, not the victim.\" In his father's case, he said, prosecutors told him the court had to protect the accused's right to cross-examine witnesses against them.\n\n\"It's an incentive to kill the witness,\" said Dave Hayer. \"Kill the witness to get rid of the evidence.\"\n\n\n\nLegal experts say it's more complicated than that. Evidence from a witness who has since died may be admitted in a trial in the right circumstances. In Tara Singh Hayer's case, it wasn't. The judge said it \"would be a highly contentious matter consuming many months and with the potential of significantly diverting the trial.\"\n\nThat decision left Hayer's death squarely at the centre of the tangled, unresolved story of Canada's worst-ever mass murder: the 1985 bombing of Air India's Flight 182.\n\nA target on his back\n\nThe killing of Hayer, publisher of the Indo-Canadian Times, was dubbed \"an assassination\" by the RCMP immediately after it was discovered. They knew that Hayer had been shot before \u2014 in 1988, soon after writing in his paper about hearing a confession linked to the Air India bombing.\n\nHayer had told the RCMP that, while visiting a friend in London, England, months after the bombing, he overheard another visiting Canadian, Ajaib Singh Bagri, describing how the bomb was smuggled onto Flight 182.\n\nAn excerpt from Hayer's statement to the RCMP. (CBC)\n\nTara Hayer's account was consistent with other evidence about the placing of the bomb. He swore an affidavit, which was made public but not used as evidence, repeated his account on videotape and indicated he was willing to testify.\n\nBut he also outed the alleged conspirators publicly \u2014 and recklessly \u2014 in angry editorials, calling the bombers \"demons.\" Doing so painted a target on his back.\n\nFour months before the first shooting in 1988, Hayer first named Bagri in print: \"If you remember the Air India flight that blew up in midair,\" he told his readers, \"the police connected to this could be keeping an eye on Bagri ...\" Then, in his July edition, he referred to \"Talwinder Singh (Parmar) and Bagri having a hand in this ...\"\n\nParmar and Bagri were both B.C. residents pushing for an independent Sikh state. Hayer agreed with their goal, but opposed attacks on civilians.\n\nA door from the Air India jumbo jet floats off the Irish coast. (Associated Press)\n\nThen, in August of 1988, his reports became more specific: \"In 1985 in England, Bagri was talking noisily about his involvement in the blowing up of the Air India airplane ...\" A week after that was published, the first gunman arrived and put Hayer in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.\n\n'If I don't speak, I can't ask anybody else to risk it'\n\nHayer's accounts to the RCMP were much more detailed \u2014 but his editorials must have sent shockwaves through the conspiracy. He received multiple death threats. Even before the 1988 shooting, a bomb had been discovered at his newspaper office. His family pleaded with Hayer to be more careful. His son told the Air India Inquiry in 2007 that their appeals were futile.\n\nDave Hayer recalled telling his father, \"Let somebody else, because we already risked enough.\" But the elder Hayer wouldn't back down.\n\n\"Millions of people in the first World War and the Second World War paid heavily to have this freedom and democracy and your right to speak, especially a country like Canada,\" the son recalls his father saying. \"If I don't speak, I can't ask anybody else to risk it.\"\n\nThe cameras died first\n\nThe risks were aggravated by what Justice John Major's inquiry described as a feeble effort by the police to protect their witness. Hayer wasn't the only one to suffer from this but, as Major put it in his 2010 report, \"nowhere are the RCMP's failures to protect its potential witnesses more dramatic than in relation to Tara Singh Hayer.\n\n\"Hayer's family testified as to the difficulty in getting the RCMP to take threats against Hayer seriously, even after two attempts had been made on his life.\"\n\nWhen Hayer was finally killed, the surveillance cameras placed by the police saw nothing. They hadn't been working for months. Nobody fixed them and the family was never even told that they were useless.\n\nAnd that was only one among many embarrassing law enforcement stumbles in the Air India investigation, a debacle marked by erased wiretaps, warnings that went ignored, interagency turf wars and witnesses scared into silence.\n\nThe murder of Tara Hayer \u2014 a journalist killed for what he wrote \u2014 remains, officially, a mystery, although one suspect is already in prison for a different killing.\n\nBagri and his co-accused at the Air India trial were acquitted. Only the bomb-maker, Inderjit Reyat, was convicted. He was released from prison last year and Talwinder Parmar \u2014 named by the Air India inquiry as the leader of the plot \u2014 fled the country and was killed by the Indian police in 1992.\n\nFor the courts and the police, it's all history now.

Watch it here.\n\nClimate change\n\nThe world is falling dangerously short of its global warming reduction targets and Canada is among the worst offenders, say scientists.\n\nA new study published today in the journal Nature Communications finds that current emission reduction efforts in Canada, Russia, China and Saudi Arabia would result in a 5.1 C warming of the planet by the end of this century, if all other nations set similarly unambitious targets.\n\nThe paper, by two Australian climate researchers, tries to reconcile the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5-to-2 C by 2100, with what it terms the \"self-interested bottom-up\" approach being taken by individual nations.\n\nThe city of Toronto skyline is framed by power lines, smoke stacks and storage tanks. The emission levels of Canada's buildings, transportation and agriculture are all well above the G20 average. (Frank Gunn/Canadian Press)\n\nLooking at emission targets through the lens of equity or fairness, the authors find that all industrialized nations, and particularly major oil exporters, are radically downplaying their role and responsibility in climate change, with India the only such country close to being on track to meet the 2 C target.\n\nAustralia, the United States and Brazil are all pursuing policies that will push the planet towards a 4 C temperature rise, while most European nations are producing emissions that would warm the planet by 3 C.\n\nThe gap between government pledges and their actual measures is now so wide, that the authors say warming targets should be set to \"aspirational levels\" of 1.1-to-1.3 C to compensate for all the fudging.\n\nThe findings echo another report released yesterday by the group Climate Transparency, which says that no G20 nation is on track to come anywhere near their 2030 Paris Agreement targets. These large economies, which are responsible for 80 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions, are instead steering the world towards at least a 3.2 C temperature rise.\n\nSaudi Arabia, Turkey and Russia were judged the worst performers \u2014 on track for emissions that would contribute to more than 4 C warming.\n\nBut the group's report card for Canada is hardly better, citing the absence of \"ambitious renewable energy targets and policies.\" It says Canada's emissions level would contribute to global warming of between 3 C and 4 C if the rest of the world behaved similarly.\n\nThe emission intensity of Canada's buildings, transportation and agriculture are all well above the G20 average, and overall the country produces almost three times more greenhouse gas per capita than the average bloc member.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks prior to signing the Paris Agreement For Climate Change at the United Nations on April 22, 2016, in New York City. (Jemal CountessGetty Images)\n\nAll of this comes a little over a month after a dire warning from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that the planet is warming even faster than projected, with the 1.5 C threshold likely to be surpassed as early as 2030, greatly increasing the risk of devastating droughts, wildfires, floods and food shortages.\n\nFor those who wonder what global warming's concrete consequences might be, the European Union's Joint Research Centre has released its own study on the human and economic consequences of a 2 C shift.\n\nThe report predicts an additional 132,000 heat-related deaths across Europe every year, as well as widespread water shortages in southern regions and a potential doubling of the continent's arid climate zone. On the flip side, northern nations are expected to experience much more rain, with flood damage anticipated to rise from 5.3 billion Euro a year to 17.5 billion.\n\nCanada was slammed in a new report for failing to set aggressive renewable energy policies. ( Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\nIf there is any bright spot, it comes in the form of an embarrassing math error.\n\nLate last month, a group of oceanographers published a paper in the journal Nature that applied a novel new method to measure oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It came to the conclusion that the world's seas were absorbing 60 per cent more heat than had been estimated, suggesting it might already be too late to halt global warming.\n\nBut another researcher pointed out a fundamental error in their calculations, and they are now working up a correction. The new calculations are expected to show that the oceans are warming at a rate closer to what the IPCC had already determined.\n\nThe fact that it was a climate science critic who discovered the mistake won't make it any easier to persuade deniers that the Earth is indeed in imminent danger.\n\nHowever, it does mean that the emission reduction targets won't have to be radically revised upwards, placing an as-yet-unattained goal even further out of reach.\n\nWriting for passion, but seldom big profit\n\nIt's tough to live on a Canadian author's average salary, and things are only getting worse, writes reporter Deana Sumanac-Johnson.\n\nThe tale of an impoverished writer, pouring coffee or scrubbing floors to make ends meet, is one of the most pervasive stereotypes of the literary world.\n\nThe story generally has the same, triumphant ending: a single mom on welfare writes the story of a boy wizard that wins over readers around the world (J.K. Rowling), or a loner who works as a janitor writes a scary novel about a bullied teenage girl with telekinetic powers and becomes one of the most popular writers in the world (Stephen King).\n\nNow, imagine if J.K. Rowling was still in need of financial assistance three Harry Potters in.\n\nThat seems to be the reality for many mid-career Canadian writers \u2014 and that includes successful ones who've won major prizes and scored deals with major publishers, but still need a full-time job to survive.\n\nStories like this are nuanced and complex, but they are important to tell, partially because they hit upon one of the great taboos among artists: talking about money.\n\nCharles Foran, for example, whose 11 books earned him the Order of Canada, until recently supported himself through a full-time job that had nothing to do with writing.\n\nCharles Foran is the Toronto-based author of several books, including Mordecai, an award-winning biography of Mordecai Richler. (James Lahey)\n\nTwo years ago, he wrote an essay in which he outlined his tough financial situation (making about $20,000 a year from his writing), despite having written a popular and award-winning biography of Mordecai Richler. The essay was the talk of the town among writers.\n\n\"These were conversations that were being had in private, over inexpensive alcohol, in less-than-fancy bars, but they're not generally had on the page. So I thought, it's time to sort of be a grown up here about this, and speak frankly,\" Foran told me in an interview.\n\nOur piece on The National tonight looks at why Canadian writers are poorer now than they've been in the past (spoiler alert: e-books have little to do with it, but educational copying does).\n\nWe also look at why a healthy literary culture, comprised of writers from all walks of life, is essential to all Canadians \u2014 not just to the tuxedoed set you see at the literary award galas.

(Anushree Fadnavi/Reuters)\n\nAccording to Slashdot.org, Dorsey explained that it seemed like a great idea when he and Twitter's fellow co-founders were starting out \u2014 list your number of followers and have it stand out by making the type a bit bigger than the rest of the text on the page: \"We did not really think much about it and moved on to the next problem to solve. What that has done is we put all the emphasis, not intending to, on that number of how many people follow me. So if that number is big and bold, what do people want to do with it? They want to make it go up.\"\n\nDorsey added that rather than focusing on followers, he thinks the more important numbers are things like how many \"meaningful conversations you're having on the platform.

(CBC)\n\nAs It Happens quickly became a must-listen-to show that entertained and enlightened Canadians while they cooked dinner, washed the dishes and got kids ready for bed. It was the show that kept people sitting in the driveway, unable to leave the car during a story of woe or wonder; a story that made you cry our howl with laughter; a story you knew everyone would be talking about the next day.\n\nFor many, the iconic theme music was the sound in your house as dad got home from work or as you got in the car to go to hockey practice. Or the sound that meant your mom would soon tell you to shush so she could hear a voice coming from South Africa or Berlin, El Salvador or Saskatoon.\n\nThat theme became the sound their own kids and grandkids heard.\n\nIt was, and is, the sound of Canada.\n\nI first came across As It Happens when I was a student, listening to AM radio, bored with pop music and looking for something else. As I spun the dial (yes, we had dials back then), I came across something I had never heard before: The voice of a woman talking to people in such a captivating way.\n\nShe was asking hard questions of politicians, funny questions of cabbage farmers, skeptical questions of people in power. She was cheeky and irreverent and her name was Barbara Frum.\n\nShe had a sidekick, some man with a droll voice and a refined sense of irony \u2014 Alan Maitland.\n\nFrom then on, I was hooked.\n\nAs It Happens co-host Carol Off goes over some notes for a show in her office at CBC in Toronto. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)\n\nIf someone had told me then that one day I would go to live on Mars, I would have shrugged and said, \"Entirely plausible.\" But if someone had told me I would one day sit in the place of that woman and ask those hard, amused, skeptical questions, I would have said \"You're out of your mind.\"\n\nOver the past 12 years of co-hosting the show, with Jeff Douglas doing an admirable job in the role of Alan Maitland, I have thought about Barbara a lot. I met her only once, when she was host of The Journal. But when I'm stumped for how to proceed with an interview, I ask myself, what would Barbara do now?\n\nI channel my inner Frum. And know that I will happily never live on Mars.\n\nWATCH: The story of As It Happens' 50-year celebration tonight on The National on CBC Television and streamed online\n\nA few words on ...\n\nMichael Jackson's young Alberta heir.\n\nQuote of the moment\n\n\"I think there's a lesson we learn about just following through with what you said you're going to do.\"\n\n- Dana Meise of Sherwood Park, Alta., on his 10-year project to hike all 21,000 kilometres of the Trans Canada trail, which he completed in Tuktoyaktuk, NWT this week.\n\nThe final leg of Dana Meise's journey was tough.

Dozens of trailers were also sitting idle in Montreal and Vancouver.\n\nThe Crown corporation issued new contract offers this week aimed at reaching agreements with its approximately 42,000 urban employees and 8,000 rural and suburban carriers.\n\nCUPW said the latest proposals made positive steps, but not enough to put an end to walkouts, which rotated Friday through most of Manitoba, as well as communities in Ontario, B.C., Alberta and New Brunswick.\n\nThe offers were time-sensitive, with Canada Post imposing a deadline of Saturday at one minute before midnight for acceptance.\n\nCUPW wouldn't say whether tentative deals could be reached by then, but said the union would not be held to an arbitrary deadline.\n\nThere is no reason to halt international shipments. Let us solve our issues at the bargaining table. \u2014 Mike Palecek, CUPW president\n\nPalecek was also critical of Canada Post for halting shipments from outside Canada.\n\n\"There is no reason to halt international shipments,\" he said in a statement. \"Let us solve our issues at the bargaining table.\"\n\nThe union said it wants concrete proposals for dealing with an escalating number of work injuries at Canada Post.\n\nHamilton said the corporation has proposed a way for the company and union to work together to identify ways to make the workplace safer, and offered to fast-track a review of workloads to reduce overburdening of carriers, who have seen a rapid increase in the number of parcels they have to deliver while letter volumes have declined.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau warned last week his government will act to end the rotating strikes if there is no significant progress in the negotiations. Trudeau did not specify what type of action might be taken, nor did he provide a timeline.\n\nEarlier this week, eBay called on Trudeau to legislate an end to the dispute in time for Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales events tied to American Thanksgiving that begin Nov. 23.\n\nWith files from the CBC's Jeannie Lee."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "St. Michael's private school alerts police to 3rd incident amid ongoing sexual assault investigation", "description": "Officials at a Toronto private boys' school announced Friday they've notified police about a third \"incident\" as the school continues to deal with a crisis sparked by allegations that students have been assaulted or sexually assaulted on camera.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/st-michaels-college-school-third-incident-1.4909202", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4907650.1542315290!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/toronto-st-michael-s-school-police-presence.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T19:02:09Z", "content": "Officials at a Toronto private boys' school announced Friday they've notified police about a third \"incident\" as the school continues to deal with a crisis sparked by allegations that students have been assaulted or sexually assaulted on camera.

A decade earlier, there had been 139.\n\nThe news industry's challenges have also led to job losses. The memo said news organizations slashed salary spending by 37 per cent between 2006 and 2016, a period that saw the number of workers in the industry fall to 24,000 from 36,000.

Dedicated coverage of public interest news (e.g. legislatures, town halls, courts) has declined,\" the note said.\n\nIn the lead up to the federal budget, the government was bombarded with ideas on how to help the news industry.\n\nA report last year from the Public Policy Forum called for a sales tax on foreign companies selling digital subscriptions in Canada, a fund to help finance reliable news and information with $100 million in federal seed money, a new \"local\" mandate for news agency The Canadian Press and changes to the CBC's online advertising.\n\nUpdate will focus on making economy competitive\n\nMore generally, the fiscal update will focus on making the Canadian economy more competitive, Morneau indicated Friday in Toronto after meeting with private-sector economists.\n\n\"What you're going to see us talking about next week is how we can ensure we can continue to be successful in the face of challenges that we're seeing. We're seeing the economy right now doing well, but we recognize that we need to think about how we're competitive tomorrow and the day after, so that we can create the kind of jobs we want for young people like the ones that are in this room,\" he said at a Kiwanis Boys and Girls Club event.\n\n\"What I heard from the private-sector economists is both a sense that our economy is doing very well right now, but a concern that we think about how we respond to global challenges around trade, U.S. challenges around taxes, and think about the big challenge we have right now in Alberta with the oil-price differential.\"\n\nCrude oil from Alberta hit a record-low price of $14 a barrel this week. Light demand for oil is pushing prices down everywhere, but the benchmark price for American oil is about $50 a barrel higher. Canadian producers are suffering because there's more oil sitting around here than they can physically move to buyers.\n\nMorneau also has been under pressure from business groups to cut Canadian corporate taxes to better compete with the United States, where President Donald Trump has done the same.\n\nBut the finance minister is widely expected to steer in a different direction next week, instead introducing measures to make write-downs on capital investments more generous.\n\nWhen asked about the impact of low oil prices on the federal books, he pointed to the strong national economy but expressed some concern for Alberta."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Bartley Kives", "title": "Winnipeg fails to meet waste-diversion target", "description": "The City of Winnipeg failed to meet its waste-diversion target last year, instead sending a greater proportion of its garbage, organics and recyclables into the Brady Road landfill.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-waste-diversion-target-missed-1.4908806", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4077379.1492699964!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/winnipeg-garbage-and-recycling-bins.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T17:35:49Z", "content": "The City of Winnipeg failed to meet its waste-diversion target last year, instead sending a greater proportion of its garbage, organics and recyclables into the Brady Road landfill.

There are fewer than 1,000 birds in the Maritimes.\n\nHabitat loss, cat predation leading to decline\n\nHabitat loss is one of the factors contributing to the decline of bird species everywhere, including Nova Scotia.\n\n\"That is the main threat to the chimney swift \u2026 and that's really the case for a lot of species at risk.\"\n\nInsect-eating birds are also affected by the global decline in flying insects.\n\nOutdoor cats are also a major threat to birds, with one study by Environment Canada suggesting that cats kill more than 200 million birds a year in Canada.\n\nProtecting bird habitat essential\n\nKeeping cats indoors isn't the only way that people can help protect bird species.\n\nAbbott said Nova Scotians can also help protect the habitat of birds in other places, by opting for things like shade-grown coffee.\n\n\"It's a little more expensive than [sun-grown], but we know that shade-grown coffee plantations are more beneficial to a lot of species.\"\n\nChimney swifts are threatened by habitat loss. There are fewer than 1,000 swifts in the province. (Ron d\u2019Entremont)\n\nAbbott also suggested taking steps to ensure birds like plovers aren't disturbed, such as avoiding walking on dunes and keeping dogs on leash.\n\n\"There's ways that people can help, just by, you know, giving these birds space and giving them safe spaces for nesting.\"\n\nUltimately, part of protecting bird species, Abbott said, is learning how to live more lightly on the land, to allow birds more space to live, too."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Bill Morneau on Financial Literacy Month LIVE", "description": "Finance Minister Bill Morneau holds a media availability to talk about Financial Literacy Month in Canada.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/bill-morneau-on-financial-literacy-month-live-1.4908830", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4908830.1542385501!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/image.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T16:45:00Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "bad url"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Zverev books semifinal date with Federer with straight sets win at ATP Finals", "description": "Alexander Zverev beat John Isner 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Friday.

He was not only a successful filmwriter, but a top script doctor, the industry title for an uncredited writer brought in to improve or \"punch up\" weak screenplays.\n\nGoldman also made political history by coining the phrase, \"Follow the money\" in his script for All the President's Men, adapted from the book by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein on the Watergate political scandal.\n\nGoldman accepts his best screenplay Oscar for All The President's Men in March 1977. (Associated Press)\n\nThe film starred Robert Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein. Standing in the shadows, Hal Holbrook was the mystery man code-named Deep Throat who helped the reporters pursue the evidence.\n\nHis advice, \"Follow the money,\" became so widely quoted that few people realized it was never said during the actual scandal.\n\n'The dean of American screenwriters'\n\nA confirmed New Yorker, Goldman declined to work in Hollywood. Instead, he would fly to Los Angeles for two-day conferences with directors and producers, then return home to fashion a script, which he did with amazing speed.

Weary of academia, he declined the chance to earn a PhD, choosing instead to write the novel The Temple of Gold in 10 days. Knopf agreed to publish it.\n\n\"If the book had not been taken,\" he told an interviewer, \"I would have gone into advertising ... or something.\"\n\nInstead, he wrote other novels, including Soldier in the Rain, which became a movie starring Steve McQueen. Goldman also co-authored a play and a musical with his older brother, James, but both failed on Broadway.\n\nJames Goldman would later write the historical play The Lion in Winter, which he converted to film, winning the 1968 Oscar for best adapted screenplay.\n\nBreakthrough with Butch Cassidy\n\nWilliam Goldman had come to screenwriting by accident after actor Cliff Robertson read one of his books, No Way to Treat a Lady, and thought it was a film treatment. After he hired the young writer to fashion a script from a short story, Goldman rushed out to buy a book on screenwriting.\n\nRobertson rejected the script but found Goldman a job working on a screenplay for a British thriller. After that he adapted his novel Harper for a 1966 film starring Paul Newman as a private eye.\n\nHe broke through in 1969 with the blockbuster Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, starring Newman and Redford. Based on the exploits of the real-life Hole in the Wall Gang of bank robbers, the movie began a long association with Redford, who also appeared in The Hot Rock, The Great Waldo Pepper and Indecent Proposal.\n\nRIP <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WilliamGoldman?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WilliamGoldman</a>.

Some college leaders complained the rules were too complex and could be overly burdensome.\n\nAmong other changes, DeVos's proposal would narrow the definition of what constitutes sexual harassment. It would be defined as unwelcome sexual conduct that's \"so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the school's education program or activity.\"\n\nIt also would allow schools to use a higher standard of proof to determine if a student should be found responsible for misconduct. While the Obama guidance told schools to use a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard, meaning the allegation is \"more likely than not\" true, the new proposal would allow a \"clear and convincing\" standard, meaning the claim is highly probable.\n\nThe department will collect public input on the rules before they can be finalized."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC Sports", "title": "Watch women's alpine World Cup slalom from Finland", "description": "Watch live coverage from the women's World Cup slalom event from Levi, Finland, on Saturday.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/winter/alpineskiing/alpine-world-cup-live-stream-women-1.4905072", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4495638.1516391772!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/women-ski-kronplatz.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T15:53:47Z", "content": "Click on the video players below to watch live action from the alpine World Cup women's slalom event in Levi, Finland.

The two men have been locked in a tense rivalry, with Bennett often criticizing Netanyahu from the right.\n\nBennett had demanded the post of defence minister, after incumbent Avigdor Lieberman resigned this week in protest over Netanyahu's Gaza policies.\n\nA senior Jewish Home official said it became clear after the Bennett-Netanyahu meeting that there \"is a need to go to elections as soon as possible.\" He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was discussing the content of a closed meeting.\n\nThe official said leaders of coalition parties will meet Sunday to co-ordinate the date for early elections.\n\nThe apparent failure of the Netanyahu-Bennett meeting seemed to seal the coalition's fate.\n\nLieberman continues criticisms\n\nThe departure of Lieberman and his Israel Beitenu party had left the coalition with a one-seat majority in the 120-member parliament. Without Bennett's Jewish Home, Netanyahu's coalition would lose its parliamentary majority.\n\nThe political crisis began with a botched Israeli undercover raid in Gaza last Sunday. The raid led to two days of intense cross-border fighting. Gaza's Hamas rulers fired hundreds of rockets at southern Israel, while Israeli warplanes targeted scores of sites in Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu has taken over the portfolio of defence minister after the resignation of Avigdor Lieberman, right, seen in July 2016 photo. (Amir Cohen/Reuters)\n\nAfter two days, Egypt brokered an informal truce between Israel and the Islamic militant Hamas. Netanyahu averted a war, but drew blistering criticism from ultra-nationalists.\n\nLieberman resigned in protest on Wednesday.\n\nOn Friday, he toured southern Israel and accused Netanyahu of being soft on terrorism. He said Netanyahu's Gaza policy is strengthening Hamas.\n\nLieberman alleged that the truce will put southern Israel under a growing threat from Hamas, similar to the threat posed to northern Israel by Lebanon's heavily armed Hezbollah militia.\n\n\"It's impossible that after Hamas launches 500 rockets at the Israeli border communities, the heads of Hamas are actually getting immunity from the Israeli cabinet,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"We are now feeding a monster\" that will only grow if not stopped, he said. \"Within a year we will have a twin brother of Hezbollah, with all the implications.\"\n\nBut on Friday, Hamas kept border protests widely restrained.\n\nThousands of Palestinians participated in a Hamas-led rally along the perimeter fence dividing Gaza from Israel, with most crowds staying 300 meters from the fence.\n\nHowever, Gaza's Health Ministry said 40 Palestinians were wounded, 18 by live fire from Israeli forces. Witnesses said others were wounded in stone-throwing incidents at the usual five protest locations.\n\nNo tire burnings or attempts to breach the fence were reported. Such acts have often triggered lethal Israeli army fire. Since the near-weekly protests began in March, more than 170 Palestinians have been killed.\n\nHamas is pressing for an end to an Israeli-Egyptian blockade that beleaguered Gaza's two million residents since the Islamic group took full power there in 2007.\n\nPrior to the Israeli commando raid that went awry, Israel allowed Qatar to deliver $15 million as a first instalment to help Hamas pay civil servants long overdue salaries. The move was seen as an attempt to defuse tension, but Lieberman also criticized it as yet another measure that will strengthen Hamas.\n\nIsrael's elections had been mandated to occur by late 2019.\n\nNetanyahu, like only David Ben-Gurion before him, is in a third term as Israeli leader. But in addition to this most recent turmoil, he has been named as a suspect in three existing corruption probes.\n\nIn February, police recommended charging him with bribery in the first two.

They did not provide names, but at least two are senior officials closely associated with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nIn an unusual measure against an important security and economic partner, the U.S. Treasury imposed economic sanctions on 17 Saudis, including Saud al-Qahtani, the crown prince's former top adviser.\n\nRiyadh maintains that bin Salman had nothing to do with the killing, even as Turkey and some Western allies, including U.S. President Donald Trump, have said ultimate responsibility lies with him as the country's de facto ruler. Changing Saudi accounts of the killing, including initial denials, have been met with skepticism abroad.\n\nTens of thousands of worshippers at Mecca's Grand Mosque and the Prophet Muhammad's Mosque in Medina, Khashoggi's hometown, joined in prayers, though the imams did not name Khashoggi.\n\nIn Istanbul, mourners raised their hands in prayer outside Fatih Mosque. An imam recited Koranic verses under a tent set up to protect against the rain, and Khashoggi's friends eulogized him.\n\n\"What we heard yesterday from the Saudi public prosecutor is not the justice we were expecting or waiting for, but represents injustice itself,\" said Ayman Nour, a liberal Egyptian politician.\n\nDear Jamal.. rest in peace..

The revelation that the body was dismembered has thus been particularly disturbing.\n\n'Not sinking in with me emotionally'\n\nThe decision to hold prayer services in the absence of a body suggests the family does not expect it to be recovered.\n\nKhashoggi's son, Salah, met the king and crown prince in Riyadh last month to receive condolences along with other relatives. He then departed for Washington after a travel ban was lifted and told CNN on Nov. 5 that he wanted to bury his father in Medina with the rest of the family.\n\n\"We just need to make sure that he rests in peace,\" Salah said. \"Until now, I still can't believe that he's dead. It's not sinking in with me emotionally.\"\n\nKhashoggi's fianc\u00e9e Hatice Cengiz, a Turkish researcher who had waited outside the consulate in Istanbul for hours on the day he was killed, and alerted the authorities and the media when he never left the building, called last week for Muslims around the world to perform the funeral prayer for him.\n\nOn Thursday, she tweeted a selfie of Khashoggi outside the Prophet's Mosque in Medina mosque, writing: \"Dear Jamal.. rest in peace. We will meet in heaven inshallah [God willing]..!\"\n\nCengiz and Khashoggi met at a conference in Istanbul in May and soon decided to wed.

(Dylan Martinez/Reuters)\n\nThe pair purchased an apartment in Istanbul, and Khashoggi was planning to live between there and Washington, where he moved 18 months earlier fearing reprisals for his views. He obtained U.S. residency and wrote for the Washington Post, becoming familiar to many American policymakers.\n\n\"I have left my home, my family and my job, and I am raising my voice. To do otherwise would betray those who languish in prison,\" he wrote in Sept. 2017, referring to intellectuals, activists and clerics arrested under bin Salman.\n\nThe killing of Khashoggi has provoked the biggest political crisis in a generation for Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter and a supporter of Washington's plans to contain Iranian influence across the Middle East.\n\nIt has also tarnished the image of bin Salman, who has pushed social and economic reforms while cracking down on dissent, upending the delicate balance inside the ruling family, and leading the country into messy conflicts in Yemen and Qatar."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Heavy snow makes for 'slick' commute on Alberta highways", "description": "The snow in central and northwestern Alberta has resulted in school bus cancellations and school closures.

He is representing a swath of private, faith-based school boards in their legal fight against Bill 24.\n\nKenney is counting on their support and does not want to alienate them.\n\nThere are 28 private, religious school boards that have not complied with Bill 24.\n\nThis week, Education Minister David Eggen warned the boards that if they do not comply with the law by June 30, 2019, he will cut off their funding.\n\nTactical flaw\n\nThe big flaw with Eggen's tactic, of course, is that we are expecting the provincial election to take place in May. And if the public opinion polls are prescient, the NDP will be defeated, along with its legal and moral power to enforce Bill 24.\n\nThe mutinous school boards are simply hoping to outlast Eggen.\n\nKenney has not said what he will do with Bill 24.\n\n\"The law is the law but we'd have to look at the state of play at that time,\" he said when asked by reporters on Wednesday.\n\nReporters also asked Kenney if he'd kick Carpay out of the UCP.\n\nThis is where Kenney began doing something of a political jig.\n\nHe said he didn't have the authority to remove a member: \"It's our board that deals with expulsions.\"\n\nBut that contradicts Kenney's declaration last month, when he kicked out party member Adam Strashok for having links to white supremacists, that he had \"instructed party officials to cancel Mr. Strashok's membership.\"\n\nSewer rats\n\nWhen pressed on the matter, Kenney dredged up the 2017 comment from deputy premier Sarah Hoffman who said the Opposition was \"spending a lot of time with sewer rats.\"\n\n(Hoffman has never actually explained who she was referring to with the clumsy barb, even though the context of the day pointed to Rebel Media, but Opposition MLAs have happily embraced it as an insult against them.)\n\nKenney said Hoffman apologized and wasn't kicked out of the party, implying the same should apply to Carpay.\n\nComparing the two incidents is a bit of a stretch, to say the least.\n\nKenney is obviously scrambling to change the channel, while the NDP is doing all it can to hog the remote control.\n\nIf nothing else, there is an odd interconnectivity to all of these events.\n\nKenney attacked Hoffman for her \"sewer rats\" comment that was an oblique reference to Rebel Media which is the group that organized this month's conference where a comparison between the Rainbow flag and Nazi swastika was made by Carpay who is leading a legal fight against gay-straight alliances by private faith-based schools who are running out the clock hoping for an election victory in 2019 by the UCP led by Kenney.\n\nA tangled web indeed."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Couple who planned holiday to Paradise spend vacation helping wildfire evacuees", "description": "A Penticton couple vacation-bound for Paradise, California decide to help wildfire victims.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/couple-who-planned-holiday-to-paradise-spend-vacation-helping-wildfire-evacuees-1.4908264", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4908331.1542344063!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/b-c-couple.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T14:00:00Z", "content": "They were headed for a Paradise, Calif., holiday, but a B.C. couple are spending their vacation in a Walmart parking lot helping wildfire victims.

The three Americans returned home on a flight with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Weeks after the summit, North Korea returned the remains of dozens of presumed U.S. soldiers killed during the 1950-53 Korean War.\n\nUnclear if threat is real\n\nKCNA said Kim on Friday observed the successful test of an unspecified \"newly developed ultramodern tactical weapon,\" though it didn't describe the nature of the weapon.\n\nIt didn't appear to be a test of a nuclear device or a long-range missile with the potential to target the United States. A string of such tests last year pushed always uncomfortable ties on the peninsula to unusually high tension before the North turned to engagement and diplomacy.\n\nStill, any mention of weapons testing could influence the direction of stalled diplomatic efforts spearheaded by Washington and aimed at ridding the North of its nuclear weapons.\n\nKim inspects a construction site in Yangdeok, in this undated photo released on Oct. 31 by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). Donald Trump has said he would welcome a second summit with the North Korean leader, although scheduled diplomatic talks between officials from the two countries were postponed last week. (KCNA via Reuters)\n\nExperts say the weapon test was likely an expression of anger by North Korea at U.S.-led international sanctions and ongoing small-scale military drills between South Korea and the United States. It's the first publicly known field inspection of a weapons test by Kim since he observed the testing of the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile in November last year, according to South Korea's Unification Ministry.\n\n\"It's North Korea-style coercive diplomacy. North Korea is saying 'If you don't listen to us, you will face political burdens,\"' said analyst Shin Beomchul of Seoul's Asan Institute for Policy Studies.\n\nEarlier this month, North Korea's Foreign Ministry warned it could bring back its policy of bolstering its nuclear arsenal if it doesn't receive sanctions relief.\n\nShin said the weapon North Korea tested could be a missile, artillery, an anti-air gun, a drone or other high-tech conventional weapons systems. Yang Wook, a Seoul-based military expert, said a \"tactical weapon\" in North Korea refers to \"a weapon aimed at striking South Korea including U.S. military bases\" there, so the North may have tested a short-range missile or a multiple rocket launch system.\n\nDiplomacy has stalled since the Singapore summit, with Washington pushing for more action on nuclear disarmament and the North insisting that the U.S. first approve a peace declaration formally ending the Korean War and lift sanctions.\n\nBut Friday's report from the North was noticeably less belligerent than past announcements of weapons tests, and didn't focus on North Korean claims of U.S. and South Korean hostility. Yang said the latest North Korean test won't completely break down nuclear diplomacy, though more questions would be raised about how sincere the North is about its commitment to denuclearization.\n\nPence cautiously optimistic\n\nU.S. Vice-President Mike Pence, attending a Southeast Asian summit in Singapore, cited the \"great progress\" made on North Korea, but said more had to be done.\n\n\"Nuclear tests were taking place, missiles were flying over Japan, and there were threats and propagations against our nation and nations in the region,\" Pence said of the state of affairs in 2017. \"Today, no more missiles are flying, no more nuclear tests, our hostages have come home, and North Korea has begun anew to return fallen American heroes from the Korean War to our soil. We made great progress, but there's more work to be done.\"\n\nPence stressed that UN sanctions had to remain enforced.\n\nU.S. Vice-President Mike Pence was at a joint news conference at the Istana or Presidential Palace in Singapore on Friday, and outlined progress with reducing tensions with North Korea the past two years. (Yong Teck Lim/Retuers)\n\nThe North said the test took place at the Academy of National Defence Science and that Kim couldn't suppress his \"passionate joy\" at its success. He was described as \"so excited to say that another great work was done by the defence scientists and munitions industrial workers to increase the defence capability of the country.\"\n\nLast year's string of increasingly powerful weapons tests, many experts believe, put the North on the brink of a viable arsenal of nuclear-tipped missiles that can target anywhere in the mainland United States.\n\nWith respect to Lowrance, the Korean Central News Agency said he was detained on Oct. 16 for illegally entering the country from China. It said he told investigators that he was under the \"manipulation\" of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. It was not clear if the North's spelling of the man's name was correct, and past reports from Pyongyang have contained incorrect spellings.\n\nLowrance is believed to be from Michigan.\n\nNorth Korea in the past has held arrested American citizens for an extended period before high-profile U.S. figures travelled to Pyongyang to secure the freedom of those being held. Last year, American university student Otto Warmbier died days after he was released in a coma from North Korea after 17 months in captivity.\n\nLittle is known about the American currently being detained. The detention and subsequent death of Otto Warmbier caused an international incident, but the U.S. and North Korea soon accelerated diplomatic relations.

The Ticats face the Ottawa Redblacks in the East Division final Sunday after beating the B.C. Lions 48-8 in the conference semifinal.\n\n\"When I took this job my wife (Brenda) asked, `How long do you think you'll stay there?\"' Glanville said straight-faced before delivering the punch line with a broad smile. \"I said, `No longer than 15 years.'\n\n\"I love it (in the CFL), I love everything about it. It's great fun, great players, the players play hard. It's just been totally great experience.\"\n\nHe's appeared in movies, driven race cars and served as a television football analyst. But make no mistake, Glanville \u2014 a former linebacker at Northern Michigan University \u2014 is a football coach and always will be.\n\n\"Coaches coach and preachers preach, they take that to the box,\" Glanville said. \"I'll be coaching when they put me in the box.\n\n\"When I was doing TV, Waylon Jennings told me, `Quit TV tomorrow. You know more football than anybody. Don't you dare die without teaching it, don't you dare die with the music inside you.' Watching coaches grow and players play is why you never say, `I'm done.\"'\n\nGlanville, a Detroit native who calls Knoxville, Tennessee, home, took his first coaching job in 1967 as Western Kentucky's defensive coordinator. He spent 20 seasons in the NFL, including nine as a head coach with Houston (1985-89) and Atlanta (1990-93).\n\nTickets for Elvis\n\nIt was with the Oilers that Glanville coined the now famous phrase, \"NFL means `not for long,\"' while chewing out an official for a bad call. Glanville often stands on the sideline dressed in black with sunglasses, he's left tickets at will call for the late Elvis Presley and rubbed many people \u2014 most notably former Pittsburgh coach Chuck Noll \u2014 the wrong way with his words and antics.\n\n\"You can't try to live forever, try to live the moment,\" Glanville said. \"The brave and courageous don't live forever but those who aren't never get to live at all. A cat is supposed to have nine lives and I think I'm down to about four. I've been very blessed.\"\n\nThe Hamilton job reunited Glanville with Ticats head coach June Jones. Glanville was on the Falcons' staff when Jones was a quarterback with the club (1977-81) and the two have worked together in both the NFL (Houston and Atlanta) and NCAA (Hawaii).\n\nBut the CFL presented challenges for Glanville, none bigger than its unlimited motion.\n\n\"You have to be smart enough to throw out a lot of your American coverages,\" he said. \"In the U.S. I'm a full bump-and-run teacher but I don't full press bump and run anybody that's off the line. I treat the motion guy like he's a slotback off the line, then I add four yards in my depth to cover them. You know what? There's a lot of bump-and-run people playing in the NFL that couldn't cover anybody up here. It's different.\"\n\nHamilton finished the regular season ranked third against the pass (247.7 yards per game) and fewest yards allowed (334.3), fourth in rushing yards (101.6), sixth in offensive points allowed (23.6 per game) and eighth in sacks (31). On Sunday against B.C., the unit surrendered just 319 total yards and one touchdown while defensive back Frankie Williams registered a pick-six.\n\nHowever, Glanville takes no credit for that performance.\n\n\"What I tell them (players) is the biggest difference between American and Canadian football is nothing,\" he said. \"It's still who hits who in the mouth, who gang tackles, who hustles. It's your attitude, it's how you play. I don't take credit for one thing we do and I shouldn't because I don't deserve it. There's never a game where our guys don't spill their guts and that's the fun of it.\"\n\nA 'football historian'\n\nLinebacker Larry Dean, who had 106 tackles this season and is a finalist for the CFL's top defensive player award, calls Glanville a \"football historian,\" who delivers sometimes very colorful messages.\n\n\"I can't repeat some of them,\" Dean said. \"We're just trying to get as much knowledge from him as we can. He has different philosophies, different ways to look at things and I just find it interesting to pick his brain and get the skin and bones of it.\"\n\nGlanville credits assistant Ticats head coach Orlondo Steinauer with helping him learn the nuances of Canadian football. But Glanville gushes about the work defensive backs coach Williams Fields and former Ticat Craig Butler, now the team's special-teams and defensive assistant, have done.\n\nHowever football isn't what defines Glanville, who's rubbed elbows with such big-name entertainers as Jennings, Johnny Cash and Burt Reynolds.\n\n\"I was with Johnny Cash when he was dying,\" Glanville said. \"When I walked over to see him I said, `Gee Johnny, how you doing,' and he said, `I've got Parkinson's and it ain't funny.' Waylon Jennings was playing the guitar when I saw him and I said, `Waylon, you're playing the blues.' He looked at me and said, `Coach, sooner or later we all go back to the blues.\"'\n\nBut Glanville took Reynolds' death in September at the age of 82 especially hard. The two worked together in the `17 film The Last Movie Star and became close friends.\n\n\"He taught you humility,\" Glanville said. \"People would line up three blocks for autographs and he never turned anyone down, he never treated anyone badly, he signed every autograph and spoke to every single person. He was bent over and had a hard time walking but he'd never take a double. He was just that type of guy.\"\n\nLike Glanville, Reynolds also enjoyed pushing the envelope when he could.\n\n\"The movie premiere was in Knoxville, because most of it was shot there,\" Glanville said. \"Burt is onstage with the producer and director and they're taking questions. So this guy asks what Burt thought about the people of Tennessee. Burt looked at him and said, `The first thing we've got to realize is we all don't have a chance to live in Georgia.' Now who else would do that? The crowd cheered. Anybody else would've been booed off the stage.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC Archives", "title": "'The Dancer's gone': The day 'Canada's most famous racehorse' died", "description": "The famed Canadian thoroughbred once won the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Queen's Plate in the same year.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/archives/the-death-of-northern-dancer-canada-s-most-famous-racehorse-1.4905195", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4905417.1542222474!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/kentucky-derby-northern-dancer.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T13:30:00Z", "content": "He's been gone almost as long as he was here.

For more than a century, the kilogram has been defined as the mass of a cylinder of platinum-iridium alloy kept in a high-security vault in France. That artefact, nicknamed \"Le Grand K,\" has been the world's sole true kilogram since 1889 .\n\nNow, with the vote, the kilogram and all the other main measurement units will be defined using numerical values that fit handily onto a wallet card. Those numbers were read to the national delegates before they voted. The update will take effect May 20.\n\nScientists at the meeting were giddy with excitement: some even sported tattoos on their forearms that celebrated the science.\n\nSome of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CGPM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CGPM</a> attendees showed off tattoos with Planck and other constants\u2014as DEFINED by the proposed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SIredefinition?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SIredefinition</a>.

Scientists want to keep studying them to see whether their masses change.\n\nThe update will have no discernable impact for most people. Bathroom scales won't suddenly get kinder, and kilos and grams won't change in supermarkets.\n\nBut the new formula-based definition for the kilogram will have multiple advantages over the precision-crafted metal lump that set the standard from the 19th century to the 21st, through periods of stunning human achievement and stunning follies, including two world wars.\n\nA replica of the International Prototype Kilogram stands at BIPM on Wednesday. The kilo and other key measurements have new definitions following a meeting of countries in Versailles. (Benoit Tessier/Reuters)\n\nUnlike a physical object, the formula for the kilogram, now also known as \"the electric kilo,\" cannot pick up particles of dust, decay or be dropped and damaged, but will be easier to share.\n\n\"If we stay where we are, and someone did accidentally drop the kilogram or if there was a contamination that we couldn't control, then the whole system has got no head. We're in chaos,\" said Barry Inglis, a scientist from Australia. \"That's the thing that's really been worrying us, I think, for maybe 15 years or more is just how vulnerable the system is, by depending just on that one little piece of platinum-iridium.\"\n\nThe redefined kilogram is expected to allow for more accurate measurements of very, very small or very, very large masses and help usher in innovations in science, industry, climate study and other fields. In humankind's efforts to quantify and understand the world, stretching back centuries to when ancient Babylonians measured mass with stones, the vote marked a major milestone, enthused scientists agreed.\n\n\"Those units, those constants chosen now, include everything we know, everything we have always known and provide that springboard for us to go pursue those things that we don't know,\" said Jon Pratt of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. He said Friday's gathering \"was just leaving me in a puddle of tears.\"\n\nScientists Yuning Duan and Gert Rietveld celebrate Friday after the vote on the redefinitions. (Benoit Tessier/Reuters)\n\nUpdated definitions for the ampere, kelvin and mole also were approved Friday.\n\nHumanity uses seven main measurements units:\n\nThe metre for length.\n\nThe kilogram for mass.\n\nThe second for time.\n\nThe ampere for electric current.\n\nThe kelvin for temperature.\n\nThe mole for the amount of a substance.\n\nThe candela for luminous intensity.\n\nOf the seven, the kilogram was the last still based on a physical artefact. With time, as the science behind the new kilogram definition becomes more accessible and affordable, the update should also mean that countries won't have to send their kilograms back to France to be checked occasionally against Le Grand K, as they have done, to see whether their mass was still accurate.\n\n\"We future-proofed the system,\" said Martin Milton, director of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.\n\nThe bureau is the guardian of the system, as well as of Le Grand K and its copies, which are stored in a vault that requires three keys, kept by three people, to unlock. Very rarely have they seen the light of day.\n\n\"We put in place a system that doesn't depend on something that is 140 years old,\" Milton said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Tractor-trailer truck destroyed by suspicious fire in Saint-Laurent", "description": "A witness called 911 at around 2:15 a.m. to report the fire on St-Amour Street, near the intersection of C\u00f4te-Vertu Boulevard, police say.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/truck-destroyed-by-fire-1.4908404", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4908416.1542373470!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/destroyed-truck.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T13:12:37Z", "content": "A tractor-trailer truck was destroyed by a suspicious fire early Friday morning in Montreal's Saint-Laurent borough.

It's not going to go away. - Carolyn Lafleche\n\nIt's a tragedy the Lafleche family might have avoided, if not for the events of 2012. That's when Cassidy was sexually assaulted and the once bubbly and outgoing teenager first turned to drugs, her mom said.\n\nLast year, Lafleche said she and Cassidy's father managed to get a court order to have their daughter admitted to Alberta Hospital. After months of treatment she appeared to be on the right track. Then in July, Cassidy's grandmother, who she was close to, died of cancer.\n\nCassidy's cheeks hollowed out and she began acting more aggressively. The demons were back, she was hooked on methamphetamine again.\n\nBarriers to services\n\nAs she sought help for her daughter, Lafleche said she repeatedly encountered roadblocks: health-care workers who failed to see the gravity of Cassidy's situation; the inability to access services for an adult daughter who wasn't in the right state of mind to do it herself; or Cassidy's paranoia that made it difficult to travel to a counselling session by taxi or bus.\n\nIn between 12-hour night shifts, Lafleche tried to schedule appointments and keep a close eye on her daughter. Sometimes, when Cassidy seemed especially anxious, Lafleche took the Wi-Fi cord with her to work, so her daughter couldn't buy drugs on Facebook.\n\nBetter support systems for the parents of drug users would make a big difference, she said. \"This way, us parents wouldn't feel so alone trying to help our children.\"\n\nOn Oct. 28, dressed in a black hoodie, Cassidy and a friend headed out for the evening.\n\nWhat Lafleche has since learned suggests her daughter stopped at two houses that night near 95th Street and 115th Avenue, before returning to her friend's place. At 5 a.m. officers found her without a pulse. Edmonton police are investigating her death.\n\nUpcoming manslaughter trials\n\nSince 2016, city police have laid three manslaughter charges in separate cases related to fentanyl overdoses. Two cases are scheduled to go to trial next year, while the charge in the third case has been stayed.\n\nAnother charge of manslaughter in an overdose death in Edson was stayed; the accused is now awaiting sentencing on trafficking charges.\n\nEdmonton criminal defence lawyer Lionel Chartrand said a manslaughter charge in most cases would be difficult to prove. The prosecutor has to show that a reasonable person would foresee the risk of bodily harm as a result of trafficking fentanyl, he said.\n\nHe described possible scenarios, such as a dealer who knows the person they are selling to has a history of overdosing, or helps a buyer who is already intoxicated consume more by, for instance, injecting them.\n\n\"It would have to be, in my view, more than just a simple sale,\" said Chartrand. \"But that remains to be seen. Some courts may rule that with the present day knowledge of the number of deaths, that a reasonable person would foresee that.\"\n\nDefence lawyer Lionel Chartrand says prosecution departments ask for much more serious penalties, and the courts are hiking jail sentences for fentanyl. (Nathan Gross/CBC)\n\nIn general, said Chartrand, prosecution departments are asking for more serious penalties, and the courts are hiking jail sentences for the trafficking of fentanyl because of its increased danger compared to other drugs. But he disputes that it's an effective deterrent, pointing out that dealers are often struggling with the same issues of mental health, poverty or addiction.\n\n\"Generally, they're not going to think, 'Well, I might get seven years instead of three, so I'm not going to do this,' \" said Chartrand.\n\nIn August, Native Friendship Centres in Edmonton, Grande Prairie, Calgary and Lethbridge received a $400,000 provincial grant to provide culturally sensitive services for treatment and harm reduction.\n\nIt's part of a $5 million investment by the province to help Indigenous communities address the opioid crisis.\n\nAt the federal level, Indigenous Services Canada said it has invested more than $350 million this year, on and off reserves, for culturally relevant mental health and prevention and treatment services for addiction.\n\nIn a statement, Alberta Health Services expressed condolences to the Lafleche family and said it has focused on reducing the harmful effects of addiction by improving access to treatment and expanding programs such as the opening of safe consumption sites.\n\nCassidy Lafleche had a close relationship with her kokum who died in July.

He can't be identified because of a publication ban.\n\nThe petition claims medical and factual evidence prove he can't look after himself or his finances. The Public Guardian may be appointed to take on that role when no appropriate family or friends are willing, able and suitable to act.\n\nFormer B.C. Representative for Children and Youth Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond wrote a scathing report about the youth's time in government care. (CBC)\n\nTurpel-Lafond, who is now a law professor at the University of B.C., wrote about the young man in a 2013 report entitled Who Protected Him? How B.C.'s Child Welfare System Failed One of Its Most Vulnerable Children.\n\nHer investigation painted a horrific picture of his childhood: his parents raised him for two years in an atmosphere of violence, neglect and substance abuse; he then bounced between foster homes; one family kept him locked in a shed; another punished bed-wetting with cold showers and bad behaviour with hot sauce in his mouth.\n\nA succession of foster parents used unsanctioned \"safe rooms\" to punish him. Police were first called to deal with his tantrums when he was eight. He was tasered when he was 11 after he stabbed a group home manager with a knife.\n\nIn the wake of Turpel-Lafond's report, the public guardian hired outside counsel to sue the province and a foster parent on behalf of the youth.\n\nThe case resulted in a settlement last February that included $2.75 million to pay for legal costs and the establishment of a trust fund that is not allowed to dip below $3 million over the course of the youth's lifetime.\n\n'Too easy to blame the child and the youth'\n\nTurpel-Lafond says she believes the settlement is the largest of its kind ever reached in Canada and will likely ultimately be worth tens of millions. She says the money at stake should trigger extra legal scrutiny.\n\nPolice tasered the youth when he was 11 years old during an incident in which he stabbed a group home manager with a knife. (CBC News)\n\n\"There should be a special kind of accountability when you have someone who's been through foster care and been abused. They turn 19 and you go to declare them incapacitated; my feeling is there should be more accountability around how are they doing,\" she says.\n\n\"Someone should be overseeing that as opposed to those who are administering those funds. Checks and balances need to be there. I'm not saying there's problems. It's just too easy to blame the child and the youth.\"\n\nIn a statement, the Public Guardian and Trustee said the office would have an obligation under the law to \"act in the best interests of the adult represented\" if the petition is granted.\n\nThe office won't comment on the specifics of the case, but said that if a person is incarcerated, the Public Guardian would still retain the authority to act in their place.\n\n'Support workers 'shadowed' his movements'\n\nAccording to the court documents, the youth has mostly lived at a Lower Mainland residential facility since 2012. He is the lone occupant. Support workers help him and monitor his activities 24 hours a day.\n\nThe youth was tasered in 2011 by police after he stabbed a manager at this group home in Prince George. (CBC)\n\n\"During his residence there, he was permitted to leave but when he did, two support workers 'shadowed' his movements to monitor his activities to try to ensure his safety,\" the petition reads.\n\n\"(He) engages in high risk behaviour including seeking and taking illicit drugs but not medications prescribed for him, drinking hard alcohol, seeking sexual encounters in public places and walking non-attentively on roads with moving traffic.\"\n\nWhen he turned 19, support and services for the young man were handed from the Ministry of Children and Family Development to Community Living B.C..\n\nThe public guardian claims the youth has overdosed on illicit drugs, engaged in threatening behaviour and committed crimes that have resulted in criminal prosecutions and convictions.\n\nHe was detained and certified under the Mental Health Act in the spring and has been admitted to hospital several times since, most recently in July for a drug overdose.\n\n'A very sweet, personal young man'\n\nThe court file includes letters from two psychiatrists and a family doctor.\n\nOne gives a \"guarded\" prognosis for the future. Another says his \"(intellectual disability), impulsivity and significant deficits in organizing means that he is not able to budget, plan and manage money even on a weekly basis.\"\n\nBut there is hope.\n\n\"It is important to point out that (name withheld) can be a very sweet, personal young man,\" writes another psychiatrist.\n\nTurpel-Lafond says that given the amount of money available for the young man's future care, the system should be able to come up with some creative ways to kindle that kind of possibility.\n\n\"It's expected in our society that we're going to have complex cases. But kids that are abused and maltreated in extreme ways, they don't just recover.

(Yong Teck Lim/Reuters)\n\nDuring the ASEAN summit, Vietnam ratified the reworked deal that remains, the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), bringing to seven the number of countries \u2014 Canada and Japan included \u2014 that start dropping tariffs and embracing common standards as of Dec. 30.\n\n\"CPTPP is something we worked really hard on,\" Trudeau told another student.\n\nAmid tense finish-line gamesmanship at APEC last year, it wasn't a sure thing that Canada would sign on.\n\n\"We got improvements over the deal negotiated by our predecessors because we wanted it to be the right deal for Canadians,\" Trudeau said.\n\nWhat's next at APEC?\n\nTrudeau said Canada's pursuit of win-win trade deals is a \"contrast to others who have a more negative approach to trade.\"\n\n\"Others\" meaning: America? One presumes.\n\nPence is attending both summits, and so far Trudeau has spoken to him once briefly, at a gala event Wednesday night. (He raised, again, Canada's objections to the persistence of steel tariffs now that NAFTA talks are over.)\n\nCanada put itself closer to the centre of conversations about reforming the World Trade Organization by hosting an early meeting of 13 like-minded nations in Ottawa last month. WTO reform has been mentioned by not only Trudeau, but other leaders as a key agenda item at APEC, where unlike at the Ottawa meeting, China and the U.S. will be around the table.\n\nJapan, a key ally in the WTO reform process, has agreed to a bilateral meeting with Canada at APEC, Trudeau's revised itinerary now shows.\n\nHe's also set for face time with his counterpart from Malaysia (which still needs some persuading to ratify the CPTPP) and Australia (which may need more fence-mending to ensure no hard feelings remain from last year's APEC unpleasantness.)\n\nTrudeau's expected to talk about climate change when he meets with Pacific Islands leaders on Saturday afternoon, an on-brand topic for his Liberal government and an easier conversation to have in Papua New Guinea than back in Canada, where conservatives are lining up to fight his carbon pricing.\n\nBut Trudeau's focus at APEC? More salesmanship, it appears.\n\n\"We will be continuing to talk about trade ties,\" he told reporters. \"APEC is an economic summit.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Robson Fletcher", "title": "Eligible voter count in Calgary's Olympic plebiscite 100,000 higher than 2017 civic election", "description": "The count of eligible voters in Calgary's Olympic plebiscite was more than 100,000 higher than in the municipal election just one year earlier \u2014 and it's not clear why.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-olympic-plebiscite-eligible-voter-discrepancy-1.4907708", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4904770.1542209197!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/oly-2026-calgary-bid-20181113.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T12:30:00Z", "content": "The count of eligible voters in Calgary's Olympic plebiscite was more than 100,000 higher than in the municipal election just one year earlier and it's not clear why.

After the vote, the final count was reported as 666,663 enumerated electors.\n\nBut, due to the timing of the Olympic plebiscite, the city wasn't able to do the same thing in its 2018 census.\n\nSo it relied on a provincial tally and, after Tuesday's plebiscite, reported the figure at 767,734 eligible voters.\n\nThe City of Calgary's unofficial results of the Olympic plebiscite, published on Nov. 13, 2018, reported 767,734 eligible voters, which is more than 100,000 higher than the figure reported a year earlier in the municipal election. (City of Calgary/screenshot)\n\n\"The basic difference seems to be that the count of eligible voters is just done very differently at the municipal and provincial levels,\" Lucas said.\n\nWhile the city relies on its census in election years, the province \"maintains a permanent registry of voters,\" Lucas said.\n\nThe provincial count is updated regularly using data from a variety of sources, he said, including Elections Canada, motor vehicle registries and death registries. Elections Alberta also does door-to-door enumeration to ensure the list is as correct and current as possible.\n\n\"If we had to pick one as the more accurate of the two, the provincial permanent registry is probably the one to pick,\" Lucas said.\n\nOther, small factors\n\nPopulation growth would also account for some of the discrepancy \u2014 but only a small part.\n\nThe city grew by about 21,000 people between 2017 and 2018, although not all of those new residents would be eligible voters.\n\nSlight differences in voter eligibility rules at the provincial and municipal level could also play a role, but Lucas said that would be a \"small component,\" as well.\n\nHe said the biggest factor is \"just the way they maintain these counts\" of eligible voters.\n\nAnd while the size of the discrepancy may still be mysterious, Lucas said the fact that the provincial and municipal counts don't exactly match shouldn't be surprising at all.\n\nHe said figuring out how many people are eligible to vote in any given election is \"actually really complicated.\"\n\nMethods vary from election to election and from place to place, Lucas said, so turnout rates \u2014 calculated by dividing the number of ballots cast by the number of eligible voters \u2014 should really be considered as more of a \"general indicator\" than a precise measurement.\n\n\"In this case, it's a real lesson in the difficulties involved in comparing turnout rates across time and across levels of government \u2014 and even across different cities,\" he said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Overbrook residents concerned by afternoon shootings", "description": "People living in Overbrook are demanding solutions after two shootings in less than a year on the same street corner.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/overbrook-shooting-response-meeting-1.4908269", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4908305.1542341903!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/diewke-de-haen-nov-15-2018.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T12:27:54Z", "content": "People living in Overbrook are demanding solutions after two shootings in less than a year at the corner of Queen Mary and Lola streets.

(Henry Nicholls/Reuters)\n\n\"I think it's absolutely vital that we focus on getting the right deal in the future, and making sure that in the areas that matter so much to the British people, we can get a good outcome,\" said Gove, 51, a potential successor to May.\n\nStephen Barclay, a little-known junior health minister, was appointed as the new Brexit secretary, although the status of the role was downgraded from chief negotiator, with May to lead the completion of talks with the EU.\n\n\"He will be doing the domestic role. The PM will be completing the last 10 days of negotiations,\" May's spokesperson said.\n\nTrade Minister Liam Fox, another leading Brexit supporter, also joined Gove in backing May \u2014 but her future remains uncertain.\n\nLeadership challenge imminent?\n\nBy seeking to preserve the closest possible ties with the EU, May has upset her party's many advocates of a clean break, and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which props up her minority government.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that the DUP had demanded May be replaced as prime minister.\n\n\"They've raised some questions with us, they've raised some concerns with us, and yes, we are looking at those,\" May said. \"We are still working with the DUP.\"\n\nPoliticians, officials and diplomats in London openly questioned how much time May had left as speculation swirled that a leadership challenge could come soon.\n\nConservative MP Steve Baker, a prominent euroskeptic, said Friday that rebels in May's party were close to the threshold that would trigger a confidence vote.\n\nIf 48 Conservatives submit letters to the so-called 1922 committee, composed of the party's backbench MPs, May would face a vote, requiring a simple majority of the total votes in order to win.\n\n\"What's happened is people have been ringing me and telling me that they are putting their letters in ... and I think we're probably not far off,\" said Baker, a key figure in the\u200b Brexit-backing wing of May's party.\n\n\"I think it probably is imminent, yes,\" he told BBC TV.\n\nStephen Barclay, a little-known junior health minister, has been appointed as May's new Brexit secretary, although the prime minister will now act as the U.K.'s chief negotiator during the final days of talks with EU leaders. (Kirsty Wigglesworth/Associated Press)\n\nBritish bookmakers William Hill said Friday it had reopened betting on the year May will leave office after briefly suspending bets when speculation about a confidence vote emerged.\n\nRaab is the bookmakers' favourite to replace May as the leader of the Conservative Party, ahead of Johnson, the former foreign minister and the figurehead of Britain's Brexit campaign.\n\nLabour Leader Jeremy Corbyn was favoured as the next prime minister, but this was due to the lack of certainty over May's position as leader of her party, said William Hill's Joe Crilly.\n\nBetting odds for a second vote on Britain's exit from the EU also saw a massive swing as uncertainty looms over whether May's deal would make through Parliament.\n\nThe British pound, which has see-sawed on Brexit news since the referendum, was flat at $1.2837 US on Friday, down almost three cents since a deal was struck on Tuesday.\n\nEU to discuss deal Nov. 25\n\nMany fear Brexit will divide the West as it grapples with both the unconventional U.S. presidency of Donald Trump and growing assertiveness from Russia and China.\n\nJo Johnson, who resigned as a minister last week, said the situation marked the worst failure of British statesmanship since the 1956 Suez Canal crisis, when Britain was forced by the United States to withdraw its troops from Egypt.\n\nAmid the political turmoil, the ultimate outcome remains uncertain. Scenarios include May's deal ultimately winning approval, May losing her job, Britain leaving the bloc with no agreement, or even another referendum.\n\nTo leave the EU on the terms of her deal, May would need to get the backing of about 320 of parliament's 650 lawmakers. The deal is due to be discussed at an EU summit on Nov. 25.\n\nBritish MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who is among the most prominent Brexiteers in May's party, was one of several Conservative lawmakers to call for a vote of no confidence on the prime minister's leadership on Thursday.

(Holly Caruk/CBC)\n\nThe unit is dispatched numerous times a year, but over the past three weeks a string of major incidents has kept the unit busy.\n\nPollock wouldn't say it's any busier than normal because when it comes to police work, there is no normal.\n\n\"The last little bit has been a little more higher profile than we are normally used to,\" he said.\n\n\"We tend to have spikes and valleys like almost anything else within policing.\"\n\nOn the same day as the Bannerman call, there was also another incident in the city's West End where two people briefly barricaded themselves inside a business they'd allegedly just robbed.\n\nThe week earlier police arrested several people after a 12-hour standoff in the Gilbert Park area.\n\nThe crisis negotiation team will often be working from a safe distance away from the scene to establish contact with suspects and help resolve situations peacefully.

You're allowing that individual to express and vent,\" said Pollock.\n\n\"The call that you're attending, there's all kinds of things that have been simmering underneath it, so we do our best to try and figure out what those pieces are.\"\n\nThose simmering emotions lead to high-stress situations for every officer involved.\n\nThe Bannerman incident saw about 100 officers respond, and nine of those were placed on administrative leave to deal with the stress, police said.\n\nAbout 100 officers were involved in the hours-long standoff outside a home near Salter Street and Bannerman Avenue in the city's North End on Nov. 7, which saw police exchange gunfire with someone inside.

The home was previously listed in 2015 for $11 million. Squire says that if this home sells at that price, it would obliterate the current record of $2.7 million.\n\nIn 2012, Premier Brian Pallister \u2014 then an opposition leader \u2014 purchased a $2-million dollar mansion on Wellington Crescent nestled on a 1.7-acre riverside lot with estimated annual property taxes of $38,000. At the time, this was the second-highest residential real-estate transaction in Winnipeg's history.\n\nOwners taking out bigger loans\n\nRob Swan, president of Huntington Homes, a Winnipeg-based custom luxury home builder, says low mortgage rates play a big role in the growth of luxury real estate.\n\n\"Interest rates are low so people are taking out larger mortgages,\" Swan says.\n\nHe says while older generations may have had the goal to pay down the home in 20 years, today many home buyers are more concerned about what they can afford cash-flow-wise from month-to-month and not necessarily expecting to live in the home for the entire mortgage term.\n\nWith 30 years' experience in the industry, he also says building inflation itself is driving many homes over the million-dollar mark.\n\n\"Twelve years ago we built a nice big fancy house with all the toys in it, and maybe it cost somebody seven or eight hundred thousand dollars. And today that same house is going to cost a million two,\" says Swan.\n\nHe says evolving building codes, six-inch framing, tariffs on drywall, cost of land are all behind the increased price tags. In addition, evolving tastes and less conventional trends in home design are having an impact on the pocket book.\n\n\"Technology has gotten better, so people are putting in larger windows because it's not as inefficient from an energy point of view,\" he said.\n\nOld-Tuxedo is Winnipeg's neighbourhood with the highest number of homes assessed at over $1 million. (Imagery 2018 Google, Landsat/Copernicus)\n\nSquire says we tend to think of luxury homes as having dozen of bedrooms and tens of thousands of square feet similar to homes in established neighbourhoods, but the reality is that some of the most expensive homes in Winnipeg are less than 4,000 square feet, but are jam-packed with luxury amenities and designs.\n\nNorth vs. South\n\nIn terms of assessment value for the purposes of property tax, there are just over 670 home in Winnipeg that are above the million-dollar threshold. However, these homes are largely concentrated in the southwestern portion of the city.\n\nIf one splits the city in half using Portage Avenue and Dugald Road as the rough boundary line, only four of the 670 million-dollar homes are located in the north.\n\nHowever, this is likely to change as new developments in The Maples neighbourhood continue to grow."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Riley Laychuk", "title": "Seed royalties at centre of Winnipeg consultation", "description": "It's being touted as a way to boost investment into research for cereal crops, but concerns are being raised about a proposal that could see farmers pay royalties on the grain seeds saved from their crops.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/seed-royalty-discussions-canada-1.4907809", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.1200059.1542332354!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hi-combine-farmers-cp03482813-8col.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T11:00:00Z", "content": "It's being touted as a way to boost investment into research for cereal crops, but concerns are being raised about a proposal that could see farmers pay royalties on the grain seeds saved from their crops.

Put in context: the $500 million haircut amounts to a 0.3 per cent trim from the province's annual spending tab.\n\nThere are several reasons the deficit reduction is so relatively small.\n\nAbout half of the $3.2 billion in \"expense savings\" the government is crediting itself with finding came from cancelling programs that were funded by revenue from the cancelled cap and trade program, so when it comes to deficit reduction, that's a wash.\n\nWhile the headline cuts in the mini-budget involve scrapping the offices of the Ontario Child Advocate and the Environmental Commissioner, as revealed first by CBC News, Fedeli couldn't say how much money the moves will save. Nor would he put a dollar figure on the savings by eliminating the French-Language Services Commissioner's post.\n\nThe government is handing out income tax breaks, and not just to low-income earners. People in the highest tax brackets are getting an income tax break worth $275 million a year.\n\nI asked Fedeli three times in his news conference to explain why he's giving the wealthiest Ontarians a tax cut when the province is in such a deep fiscal hole. Each time, he refused to answer the question directly.\n\nOntario NDP Leader Andrea Horwath speaks to reporters at the provincial legislature. (Christopher Katsarov/Canadian Press)\n\nThe single biggest reason the deficit is trimmed so little: Ford's Progressive-Conservatives do not have the knives out for health care or education spending (at least, not for now).\n\nFedeli's fiscal documents show the government is projecting to spend $61.7 billion on the Ministry of Health this fiscal year. The Liberal government's health budget for 2018-19 was $61.3 billion.\n\nThe Ministry of Education budget is $29 billion, the same amount as the Kathleen Wynne's government was planning to spend this year.\n\nSo why no noticeable cuts to the two biggest-spending ministries in the province? In part, because there are simply no quick ways to cut costs in health and education without laying off a whole bunch of people. If there were, they would have been done by now. Ford's PCs insist they do not want to simply shut down hospitals and close schools, or fire nurses and teachers.\n\nIf it is actually possible to save money in health and education without cutting services (and without cutting jobs as Ford has promised), it will not be easy and it will take time.\n\nNDP Leader Andrea Horwath believes the numbers indicate that a big cut is coming to welfare spending. That's because the $17 billion budget for the newly merged Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services is about $900 million less than what the Wynne government budgeted for the two separate ministries back in March. Minister Lisa MacLeod is promising to reveal her social assistance reforms next Thursday, after previously saying they would be announced on Nov 8.\n\nFedeli takes questions in a news conference after tabling the fall economic statement. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press)\n\nThe 156-page fall economic statement tabled by Fedeli on Thursday contains some strong hints of things likely on the way from the government, perhaps as early as the full budget in the spring.\n\nThe mini-budget devotes three pages to a discussion of business tax competitiveness, with details of how Donald Trump's recent tax reform in the U.S. eliminated the corporate tax advantage that Ontario long had over such states as New York, Michigan, Indiana and Ohio. It clearly sets the stage for a cut to the corporate tax rate, something Ford promised during the election campaign.\n\nThe document re-states the promise made during the campaign and in the throne speech to \"further reduce electricity rates by 12 per cent.\" But there is no timeline for when it will happen, nor any indication of how it will happen. The PCs had suggested they would fund the rate cut in part by sharing the government's Hydro One stock dividend with electricity customers. But the $65 million quarterly dividend the government got in September went straight into provincial coffers.\n\nFedeli did not lay out a \"path to balance\" in the document, so we have no idea when he intends to get rid of the deficit. He has declined to describe the timeline in any terms more specific than prudent and reasonable. Under provincial law, he must put a back-to-balance schedule in the budget next spring.\n\n\"Everyone across the province will be required to make sacrifices, without exception,\" Fedeli said in his speech to the legislature Thursday.

A year later, it had reduced that number by 4.6 per cent, the first time officials say that's happened in \"many years.\"\n\nLast year, the health authority announced it would use an additional $6.4 million in the health-care budget to hire four surgeons, four anesthesiologists, and more support staff for hip and knee surgeries.\n\nBut while wait lists for such surgeries are down, the wait times are still triple the national standard of six months.\n\nGrand Pr\u00e9 resident Edie Lloyd went on the waiting list for a replacement of her right hip in July.\n\n\"I'm to the point where I'm not really doing anything because of the pain,\" said the 59-year-old.\n\nLloyd said she was told she would have a wait time of between eight to 12 months, but she's discouraged she still doesn't have an exact date for surgery.\n\nEdie Lloyd has been on the wait-list for a hip replacement since July. (Submitted by Edie Lloyd)\n\nShe said before her hip pain increased she was an active volunteer, a weekly churchgoer, took an aquafit class three times a week, and attended a weekly yoga class.\n\n\"I'm struggling getting any activity in, which is counter-productive. You're on the teeter-totter of the pain goes up, and your activity level goes down,\" she said. \"Then you get confined and you start to feel depressed, so it just affects everything.\"\n\nThe health authority said it's working on a two-step process to reduce wait times. The first stage is to funnel patients to \"orthopedic assessment clinics\" where nurses and physiotherapists answer questions and help strengthen patients before surgery.\n\nOn Oct. 15, it began the second stage of its plan. Staff encourage patients to get moving in group exercise classes almost immediately after surgery.\n\nMarlene MacInnis had her left knee replaced at the QEII Health Sciences Centre in Halifax on Tuesday afternoon and by Wednesday morning was in a physiotherapy class doing strengthening exercises.\n\n\"That makes me feel good that I did them. I never thought in the world that I would be able to do them the day after, but anyway I was,\" MacInnis said. \"I won't tell you it's not sore.\"\n\nMarlene MacInnis smiles while attending an exercise class the day after her knee surgery in Halifax. (CBC)\n\nPatients are encouraged to wear their own clothes instead of hospital gowns, and staff place them in special recliner chairs soon after surgery to encourage them not to lie down in bed.\n\nPatients typically stay between a day and a half and three days on the unit, but the goal is to be able to send most patients home the same day as their surgery, thus clearing the beds for more patients.\n\n\"They're doing really well, and there's a whole different feel on the unit,\" said Angela Bransfield, the health service manager for an orthopedic unit at the QEII Health Sciences Centre.\n\n\"Before this model they would have had Johnny shirts on, they would have not been up and moving as quickly. We would have been doing therapy in their room with them, and if they were feeling not quite so well maybe we wouldn't make them move that day. But there's more of an incentive to get people moving and have people buy into that.\"\n\nSaxe-Braithwaite moved to Nova Scotia from Ontario specifically to work on changing the system to reduce wait times. The new model, she said, is meant to be a better experience for patients.\n\n\"Seeing the patients and talking to the patients on their way to exercise class actually gives me goosebumps,\" she said. \"It's so rewarding to see patients up in a chair, happy, feeling like they've had a different experience this time.\"\n\nAngela Bransfield is the health service manager for the orthopedic unit at the QEII. (CBC)\n\nThe health authority has hired more than 100 people to implement the model, including four orthopedic surgeons. The surgeons are now all on the job, and the last one who was hired began work in New Glasgow last week.\n\nThe number of hip and knee surgeries being performed has increased by eight per cent, according to the health authority. The latest Health Department data shows July-September wait times were about 18 months. During the same period last year, knee replacements took more than two years, and hip replacements approximately 21 months.\n\nBut news of the new \"wellness model\" does not comfort Edie Lloyd as she waits.\n\n\"The general public don't understand that,\" she said. \"They know they're frustrated and they're waiting, but they don't understand that when they say 'new model,' what that really means. What I really want to know is, is what they're doing working?\"\n\nThe health authority staff say the data they have right now shows \"retrospective\" wait times, but they expect to gather data on how the new wellness model is affecting the number of people on the wait-list and the wait times for individuals.\n\n\"Since we just launched, we're not even a month old in launching the new wellness model. I'd say six months to a year we should start to see some concrete, tangible data,\" said Saxe-Braithwaite.\n\nThe health authority said its overall goal is to achieve the national six-month standard by April 2020, but that some sites such as Cape Breton may reach the goal sooner."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Blair Rhodes", "title": "Girlfriend of slain cab driver angry killer is getting passes from prison", "description": "Kelly-Anne Goode learned last week that Kenneth Purcell's killer has been granted six unescorted temporary absences from prison to be taken over the next year and a half.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/girlfriend-of-slain-cab-driver-angry-killer-getting-passes-1.4907319", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4908233.1542332771!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/kenneth-purcell.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T10:00:00Z", "content": "The girlfriend of a Nova Scotia cab driver who was stabbed to death 13 years ago on Christmas Day is angry that his killer is getting temporary passes from prison.

Women who he said \"were not deemed to be capable, who were judged on their appearance,\" similar to how he felt as a 13-year-old black boy growing up in London.\n\nWorking with Gone Girl novelist and screenwriter Gillian Flynn, they relocated the action to modern day Chicago. In the new film, four wives led by Viola Davis discover a heist-gone-wrong has created a situation where they owe a dangerous politician millions.\n\nWith McQueen's earlier films, Shame and Hunger, there was an uncompromising quality to what he asked audiences to endure. But with Flynn as his co-writer, McQueen softens the blow with a punch of a plot, inviting audiences onto a roller coaster where they gasp one moment and cheer the next.\n\nWorlds apart\n\nAs the four women come to terms with their fate, they're forced to rise to the occasion, quickly finding the courage and skills for an audacious crime. But McQueen widens the view, painting a portrait of a divided city in Scorsese-ian tableaus of crime and corruption.\n\nAt the top of the privilege pyramid are Colin Farrell and Robert Duvall as politicians Jack and Tom Mulligan. Duvall is the the old guard of a racist political dynasty trying to hang on. Farrell plays his ambitious son. Their few scenes together hint at a relationship filled with bitterness and bile.\n\nEdging in on the Mulligan territory is Bryan Tyree Henry as Jamal Manning. Jamal positions himself as the people's savior, but his brother \u2014 played by an ice-cold Daniel Kaluyaa \u2014 shows what the Mannings are willing to do to knock the Mulligans off their perch.\n\nFrom left to right Daneil Kaluuya and Brian Tyree Henry play brothers Jamal Manning and Jatemme Manning. One is an ice-cold killer, the other an ex-criminal with political aspirations. (20th Century Fox)\n\nFrom society dinners, to church potlucks, Widows adeptly captures the uneven mosaic that makes up Chicago. As Flynn told CBC News Widows captures the idea that, \"We live in so many different bubbles today and you could live in your own different space and never meet someone outside of it.\"\n\nMcQueen visualizes that notion as audiences watch Jack Mulligan finish a political rally and drive from a rundown part of the city to his upscale election headquarters.\n\nSean Bobbit, the cinematographer who's worked with McQueen from the beginning, captures the journey in a single shot of a limo's exterior \u2014 the reflections on the tinted window of liquor stores and abandoned buildings quickly giving way to plush urban estates \u2014 a few blocks away but worlds apart.\n\n'Animal instinct'\n\nIn any other film, actors such as Daniel Kaluuya and Colin Farrell would be the main attraction. But for Widows they're just the window dressing. The true engine of the film is Viola Davis, who at 53 is finally getting roles worthy of her talents. With a glare capable of stopping time, she plays Veronica who marshals the women together spitting out the line, \"No one thinks we have the balls to pull this off.\"\n\nBest known for her intensity on the TV show How to Get Away With Murder, Davis told CBC News working with director Steve McQueen challenged her. She said McQueen pushed her to be more vulnerable and feminine, as viewers see in the tender opening moments with her husband played by Liam Neeson.\n\nColin Farrell stars as Jack Mulligan, a politican trying to escape his father's shadow. (20th Century Fox)\n\nDavis is currently riding a wave of success, but to play Veronica, she drew on her early days, growing up poor in Rhode Island. She said she remembers going into the grocery story, \"and you see all of that food on the shelf and you haven't eaten since I don't know when, trust me you start thinking of criminality ... it's that animal instinct to survive.\"\n\nLike any heist film, each of the four characters, Davis, Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki and Broadway star Cynthia Erivo are responsible for part of the plan. Typically in caper films such as Ocean's Eleven, the satisfaction comes from watching the pieces click into place. What makes Widows remarkable is how it makes clear the true cost of each piece.\n\nViola Davis, known for her fiery performances, shows a tender side in moments with her husband played by Liam Neeson. (20th Century Fox)\n\nSteve McQueen has said part of what inspired him to make Widows, was that after 12 Years a Slave he noticed how many talented female actors weren't working.\n\nBy giving Rodriguez, Davis, Debicki and Erivo characters worthy of their talents, McQueen has made one of the most vital films of the year. A movie that sees America in all its fractured fury.\n\nRating: 5 out of 5 stars."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Your smartphone is burning a lot of carbon", "description": "In this week's issue of our environment newsletter, we look at the carbon footprint of your smartphone use, a potential tipping point for sustainable investing and reader tips on greener living.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/what-on-earth-newsletter-smartphone-carbon-footprint-1.4904887", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4907408.1542311046!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/smartphone-use-has-a-big-carbon-footprint.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T09:00:00Z", "content": "This is our weekly newsletter on all things environmental, where we highlight trends and solutions that are moving us to a more sustainable world.

We may even watch an entire movie that way.\n\nIt turns out this common, seemingly innocuous act \u2014 and our internet use more generally \u2014 is leaving a lasting impact on the environment.\n\nIn a study published earlier this year, two professors at McMaster University in Hamilton looked at the carbon footprint of the information and communications technologies industry (ICT), which includes the internet.\n\nAnd it's a Bigfoot-worthy print.\n\nIn the study, the ICT \"universe\" includes computers, phones and laptops; telecommunications structures, such as satellite dishes and routers; and, crucially, data centres, the backbone of the internet. (What it didn't include is the Internet of Things, computers in cars and smart TVs. At the moment, that type of data use is still somewhat new, though the study's authors say it would be figured into future studies.)\n\nMcMaster associate Prof. Lotfi Belkhir and his colleague Ahmed Elmeligi found that ICT is responsible for about 1.5 per cent of worldwide carbon emissions. As a comparison, the energy sector accounts for roughly 27 per cent, while agriculture, forestry and other land use make up 25 per cent.\n\nThe study suggests that by 2040, ICT's carbon emissions could account for as much as 14 per cent, which is roughly where the transportation industry is right now.\n\nIt might surprise you to know that. The findings surprised Belkhir, too.\n\nSmartphones were by far the worst contributors to tech's carbon footprint. That's because of several factors, including the mining activity needed to extract the metals needed to make our phones. For one thing, your phone requires almost 10 times as much precious metals as a laptop or desktop computer.\n\nAlso, we just use our phones way more often.\n\nData can seem invisible to us \u2014 especially if you're on an unlimited plan \u2014 but every email, tweet and video lives on a server. With all the servers humming away in data centres, those giant buildings need to be cooled \u2014 and the emissions are through the roof.\n\nThe increasing prevalence of smartphones is not helping. As the number of users is only likely to grow, Belkhir said we need to rethink how we power communications.\n\n\"What needs to change is the way we're running our data centres,\" he said. One of his study's recommendations: Run those data centres exclusively on renewable energy.\n\nBelkhir believes this is completely doable. He said solar energy is getting ever cheaper, and server farms tend to be located outside urban centres, which are ideal locations for solar and wind installations.\n\nHe said consumers also have a role to play. For one thing, he said we should keep our existing phones longer, which would curtail all that mining activity. A more immediate suggestion, however, is for us to reduce our internet use \u2014 particularly video, which eats up a ton of data.\n\nThat means thinking twice before downloading and watching a movie on our phones.\n\nSaid Belkhir, \"Maybe going with friends to the movies and watching a movie there on the big screen is actually more environmentally friendly than each one of them watching it on their smartphones.\"\n\n\u2014 Nicole Mortillaro\n\nMissed any issues of What on Earth?\n\nYou're reading the fifth issue of our newsletter.

And numbers out of the U.S. are even more eye-popping. The biennial report from the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment calculates that there's $12 trillion US being put to work on investments in renewable energy and other initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change.\n\nThat's music to the ears of Toronto-area investment coach Tim Nash, who said that for too long, his clients had a hard-wired bias against green investments, assuming that anything \"sustainable\" was somehow inferior in the core aim of making money.\n\n\"They just assume performance is going to be worse,\" Nash said this week, \"against all evidence to the contrary.\"\n\nFor a long time, green investing was seen as something only idealistic hippies were into \u2014 not ruthless, profit-hungry hedge funds. But saving the world, it seems, is good for business, which is why the smart money on Wall Street and Bay Street wants in.\n\nEven the capitalists who run Canada's pension plan are getting in on the action. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) has earmarked $3 billion in the past two years to green energy projects.\n\nFor Ben Lambert, CPPIB's interim head of sustainable investing, the reason is simple.\n\n\"Our job is to maximize returns without risk of loss for generations to come \u2026 and the research shows that companies that do well on these sustainability issues extend their corporate life and are more likely to create value over the long term.\"\n\nWhich is why these days, big investors are more likely to put money into an oil company that's readying for a world without oil than they are to gobble up a pollution-belching mining company that has no plan beyond its next quarterly results.\n\n\"It's about doing the right thing and generating returns,\" Lambert said. \"It's a win-win situation.\"\n\n\u2014 Pete Evans\n\nThe Big Picture: Worldwide solar and wind power\n\nIn August, research firm Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported that the combined installed capacity of solar and wind power globally had surpassed one terawatt, or 1,000 gigawatts. (That's roughly the total power capacity of the U.S.) It took about two decades to get here, but Bloomberg NEF estimates it will only take until the middle of 2023 for this figure to double \u2014 and that installing the second terawatt will cost 46 per cent less than the first.\n\nHot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web\n\n\"We think that we as humans should be able to dominate this phenomenon of wildfire. And in reality, we can't.\" A sobering essay in The Atlantic Monthly on the power of wildfires, and why they are likely to intensify in the years ahead.\n\n\n\nPalm oil is a key ingredient in many of our beloved foods, but extracting it is environmentally harmful. A new analysis by Greenpeace says that in the last two years, suppliers to Mondelez \u2014 makers of Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers \u2014 have razed tens of thousands of hectares of orangutan habitat in Indonesia to cultivate palm oil.\n\n\n\nRemember all that xenophobic talk from President Donald Trump prior to the U.S. midterms about the \"caravan\" making its way to the southern U.S. border? This essay in Forbes suggests the migrants may be escaping the effects of climate change in Central America.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of marches, 50,000 Montrealers hit the streets last weekend demanding the new Quebec government increase action to combat climate change.\n\nYou're doing your part\n\n(David McNew/Getty Images)\n\nIn our last newsletter, we asked you to share some of your personal initiatives in reducing your carbon footprint. And you kindly obliged.\n\nHere are some of your examples. We will continue to publish other reader tips.\n\nClaudette Preece of Courtenay, B.C., wrote:\n\n\"We have had a heat pump for 16 years and replaced it last winter with a model that will withstand minus\u201320 temperatures.\n\n\"We installed solar panels about three years ago. Thirty-six of them. We got rid of our hot water heaters and installed a gas-fired hot water on-demand system. We have gone from our 14-year-old gas-driven car to a Mitsubishi PHEV. Wanted one that did more mileage on battery but the waiting list was eight months. This does enough mileage on battery to do all my errands and shopping trips. On long trips, if the engine kicks in, it is to recharge the battery, not to run the engine. Since purchasing it May 1st, we have filled it up with gas about five times, and on none of those occasions was it completely empty.\"\n\nOne reader, who wished to remain anonymous, had a raft of good suggestions, including:\n\nUsing reusable grocery bags, and keeping them in your trunk \" so you never forget them!\"\n\nCarrying a reusable water bottle around at all times, saying there is no need for bottled water, because \"municipal tap water is safe and delicious.\"\n\nShe has LED lightbulbs and low-flow showerheads installed at home.\n\nShe also does clothes swaps, in which she and friends get together and exchange gently used clothing.\n\nShe also made a couple of bigger points:\n\n\"The 3 Rs are real, and \"reduce\" is so important. Shop less. Bring less stuff into your house.\"\n\nAnd:\n\n\"I get out in nature as often as I can, as someone who works behind a desk in an office, to admire its beauty and appreciate it, and improve my physical and mental health.Knowing more about the environment and loving all of its wonderful qualities helps you understand why it must be preserved and protected.\"\n\nAmen to that.\n\nFinally, Ch\u00e9lie Elsom of Salmon Arm, B.C., wrote in to tell us that she has been so \"passionate about plastic pollution\" that she started an online petition.\n\nPetition 1834, which is sponsored by Green Party MP Elizabeth May and slated to be tabled in the House of Commons in January 2019, calls for a \"National Plastic Strategy.\" That includes a ban on \"the manufacturing, distribution and use of all plastics that cannot be recycled\" and a \"Zero Plastic Waste Canada\" by 2030, where all plastic packaging is 100 per cent recyclable, reusable or compostable.\n\nStay in touch!\n\nAre there issues you'd like us to cover?

Released for World Antibiotic Resistance Week, which ends Sunday, the Leger survey of more than 1,500 Canadians aged 18-plus also found that 44 per cent see resistance as of more concern for developing countries.\n\n\"Antimicrobial resistance affects everyone, everywhere, and that includes Canada, where it is an increasingly serious concern,\" said Morris. \"It is truly a global health issue that warrants collective action.\"\n\nBy 2050, drug-resistant infections are predicted to lead to an estimated 2.4 million excess deaths in developed countries alone, according to a recent projection by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which represents nations like Canada, Australia, the U.S. and the U.K.\n\nOther experts have warned that by that date, the annual death toll due to antibiotic resistance will soar to 10 million worldwide \u2014 dwarfing cancer \u2014 and cost the global economy $100 trillion US.\n\n\"Literally the worst thing that could happen is we will end up the way it was in the 1920s and 1930s again,\" before the discovery of penicillin, when more people died from infection than from any other single cause, said Wright.\n\n\"There are people dying today in Canadian hospitals that five years ago they wouldn't have died from [their] infection,\" said Wright.\n\n\"It's not necessarily thousands of people. People aren't dropping dead in the street. There's not a zombie apocalypse,\" he said.\n\n\"But we have people in our hospitals that we haven't been able to treat.\"\n\nAnd it's not just those already with infections that could be affected by resistance, he said. \"It will go back to a time when you can't do an organ transplant because you're going to be immune-compromised for the rest of your life. You're not going to be able to save premature babies, treat leukemia.\n\n\"The things that we think of as absolutely routine today are going to be gone, or if not gone, incredibly risky.\"\n\n'Greatest health-care threat'\n\nBoth Wright and Morris stress that concerted action needs to be taken now to stem the tide of resistance, and that means the federal and provincial governments taking a leadership role to co-ordinate innovative programs to encourage antibiotic development, to find alternative treatments, and to curb misuse and overuse.\n\n\"We're really at this perfect storm level and it filters down to not every Canadian \u2014 not every Canadian is currently affected by this \u2014 but we are getting everyday Canadians getting affected by it now and it will increasingly become worse,\" Morris said.\n\nBarring global war or some catastrophic runaway virus emerging, \"I think the greatest health-care threat moving forward around the world is absolutely antimicrobial resistance.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "School bus cancellations for Ottawa-Gatineau", "description": "Is your child's school bus running today?

It is a rich source of stem cells, similar to those found in bone marrow, and can be used to treat leukemia, lymphoma, immune deficiencies and genetic disorders.\n\nHowever, patients told The Fifth Estate they were not informed that the hospitals have a financial incentive in the cord blood banked in the facilities on their premises.\n\nFollowing The Fifth Estate's investigation, Mount Sinai Hospital said it is changing its practices and will be more transparent about its relationship with Insception.\n\nThe hospital recently put up signs highlighting its financial interest in cord blood collected there, and it changed its website to indicate the same.\n\nFollowing an investigation by The Fifth Estate, Mount Sinai Hospital placed this sign at Insception Lifebank's office on its premises. (CBC)\n\nIn a statement to The Fifth Estate, Sally Szuster, senior manager of communications at Mount Sinai, said a \"process is underway to identity further opportunities to improve the transparency of our business relationship with our cord blood vendor to patients.\"\n\nIn the last decade, hundreds of private companies have popped up worldwide, capitalizing on the billion-dollar stem cell industry. For a one-time fee of more than $1,000 for blood collection, and an annual fee of more than $100, a child's cord blood is stored and earmarked exclusively for the family's use.\n\nEasy decision\n\nWhen Colleen Maurizio, a Toronto resident, was pregnant with her first child, she visited Insception's office in the women's unit at Mount Sinai.\n\n\"I sort of passed by it a number of times on different appointment visits, and I finally went in there one day and got some information,\" said Maurizio.\n\nAfter speaking with the company's representative, she said the decision was easy. She delivered both her children at Mount Sinai and stored the cord blood of her daughters with Insception.\n\nColleen Maurizio banked both her daughters' cord blood with Insception Lifebank at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. (CBC)\n\n\"[Insception] being right in the same area as all the obstetricians gave me a lot of confidence that they are obviously a reputable company.\"\n\nMaurizio, like other parents, was not made aware that a portion of the money she paid to Insception goes to the hospital.\n\nInception's affiliation with Mount Sinai began in 2004 when it was founded by doctors at the hospital. Documents obtained by The Fifth Estate show that Mount Sinai received close to $2.7 million when Insception was sold to an Australian company in 2016.\n\nToday, Mount Sinai receives $50,000 a year from Insception and an additional $125 per cord blood unit banked at the hospital. Through Mount Sinai, Insception has stored more than 4,000 units over the last five years.\n\nInsception also has a satellite office at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. Like Mount Sinai, Sunnybrook and the Scarborough Hospital get a yearly fee from the private company and additional fees per cord blood unit banked in exchange for access to patients.\n\nChanges promised\n\nThe Scarborough Hospital said it has not been disclosing its financial arrangement to patients who bank their cord blood with Insception. However, following The Fifth Estate's investigation, David Belous, the interim executive director of communications and government relations at the hospital, said \"we are going to be working on disclosure to the patients.\"\n\nSunnybrook said it is still looking into the matter.\n\nIn a statement to The Fifth Estate, Mount Sinai said a portion of revenues generated from Insception's Mount Sinai location is \"directed towards supporting clinical research, education, medical equipment and other investments in patient care.\"\n\nTrudo Lemmens, a health law and policy professor at the University of Toronto, says he finds it disturbing that public hospitals are promoting private cord blood banks. (CBC)\n\nTrudo Lemmens, a professor of health law and policy at the University of Toronto, said the hospitals' practices are problematic.\n\n\"They should certainly disclose, in my view, the fact that there is financial benefit,\" he said.\n\nThere have also been longstanding concerns about the medical necessity of privately banked cord blood. For the past decade, the American Academy of Pediatrics has advised that \"private storage of cord blood as 'biological insurance' should be discouraged.\"\n\nUsing hidden cameras The Fifth Estate recorded an appointment between a prospective mother and Insception's clinical consultant at Mount Sinai. The consultant made the case for storing a child's cord blood, giving a list of more than 80 life-threatening diseases cured by cord blood.\n\nWatch The Fifth Estate recording\n\nInsception representative says banking cord blood is an investment 0:55\n\n\"It's an investment for this baby, God forbid, if the baby ever needed it,\" the consultant said. \"[Once] you have it, you can be free and have peace of mind.\"\n\nThe consultant said cord blood has been used to cure more than 45,000 patients over two decades worldwide.\n\nDr. Donna Wall, a leading transplant specialist at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, said \"there is no question [cord blood] is lifesaving.\" However, she said that the majority of transplants and diseases cured are through the public cord blood bank, not private or \"family banks.\"\n\nDr. Donna Wall, a transplant specialist at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, says she would not use a child's own cord blood for treatment of leukemia or a genetic defect. (CBC)\n\nAbout five years ago, Canada joined the world of public cord blood banking. Managed by Canadian Blood Services, the National Public Cord Blood Bank gives patients free access to an international network of 70 registries around the world.\n\nThose who question the medical viability of private banks say there is a much greater likelihood of doctors using cord blood from the public bank over privately stored cord blood.\n\n\"When I do a transplant for a child with leukemia, I don't want that child's own blood,\" said Wall.\n\n\"If a child needs a transplant \u2026 well guess what, their cord blood has the same disorder. So it makes no sense to use it,\" she said.\n\nThe one exception is for families where a sibling or family member has a genetic or malignant condition that could potentially be treated with cord blood.\n\nNot their understanding\n\nTwo mothers who stored their cord blood with Insception at Toronto-area hospitals said their understanding was that, if needed, the blood could be used to treat their children for any condition.\n\n\"When I signed up for it, nobody told me that 'Oh actually, if she was to get leukemia, you can't use her own.'

According to Insception, of the 70,000 cord blood units stored in its facilities in Canada, it has released 14 for transplants since 2004.\n\nFollowing The Fifth Estate's inquiries, Insception also changed its website to state that \"in cases of early childhood leukemia, the child's own cord blood would not likely be used.\"\n\n'How would I have known?'\n\nMaurizio said she feels more needs to be done from the medical side to ensure the parents are making informed decision for their families.\n\n\"Part of me feels a little bit foolish for not having considered these things, but then part of me said how would I have known?\" said Maurizio.\n\nDawson agrees. \"Honestly, as someone who's not from a medical background, how would you even know what questions to ask?\"\n\nLemmens said the situation can be \"emotionally vulnerable\" and daunting for prospective parents. Instead of providing them with the support they need, Lemmens said it looks like hospitals are supporting cord blood banking as a form of \"insurance.\"\n\n\"I find it indeed disturbing that because of the funding they receive for this service they're basically promoting a practice which I would say from a medical perspective doesn't seem to be the best standard of care.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Jessica Deer", "title": "Kahnawake calls federal consultation plan on Indian registration a 'threat of assimilation'", "description": "While the federal government is in the early stages of consultation on what to do with Indian registration beyond recent amendments to the Indian Act, one First Nation community is already speaking out against the process.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/kahnawake-consultation-indian-registration-1.4907553", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4068543.1492032810!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/mohawk-council-of-kahnawake.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T09:00:00Z", "content": "While the federal government is in the early stages of consultation on what to do with Indian registration beyond recent amendments to the Indian Act, one First Nation community is already speaking out against the process.

If a vehicle is used, companies are required to fill out a questionnaire to determine if the driver is an employee or an independent operator.\n\nFood delivery apps have exploded in popularity, allowing customers to order meals from their favourite restaurants and have them delivered for a fee. The app companies rely on an informal network of couriers to deliver the food, and they're usually paid per delivery and sometimes for distance travelled. (CBC)\n\nUber Eats, SkipTheDishes and Foodora all classify their delivery couriers as independent contractors \u2014 a classification that also does not guarantee workers minimum wage, sick days, overtime or paid vacation.\n\n\"There are many benefits to working as independent contractors, including having the flexibility to choose when and how often to earn additional income on their own schedules,\" said the SkipTheDishes spokesperson.\n\n\"Uber makes clear to delivery partners that they are operating as independent contractors. Partnering in this way offers them unique advantages, including when, how, how long and for whom they choose to work,\" said the Uber Eats spokesperson.\n\nThere are currently at least two legal challenges in Canada seeking to change how app companies classify its workers \u2014 a move that would declare them employees instead of independent contractors, and ensure all benefits that come along with that.\n\nIn one case, a delivery driver in Winnipeg filed a lawsuit against SkipTheDishes in July 2018 and is seeking a class-action certification.\n\nAnother proposed class action in Ontario, Heller v. Uber Technologies, hit a roadblock after a judge stayed the claim because the company's contract included a clause that required drivers to resolve any disagreements through arbitration in the Netherlands, the location of one of their major international offices.\n\n\"That is the death of employment law,\" said Lior Samfiru, the labour lawyer who is representing the plaintiff in the Ontario case, arguing it is unrealistic to expect workers to travel 6,000 kilometres to pursue legal action.\n\n\"If employers can require people to fly to a foreign jurisdiction and engage in a costly arbitration, then every employer would do that. And your rights, my rights would cease to exist.\"\n\nSamfiru is appealing the ruling, with a decision expected at the end of November.\n\n\"It's a big deal. It's minimum wage, vacation, severance \u2014 all of these things,\" he said. \"Do we care about that? Do we want people to have those rights? \u2026 I think we do as a society.\"\n\nIf the employer doesn't pay workers' compensation, it will instead fall to \"the taxpayer-funded social assistance programs,\" Macdonald said.\n\n\"So we are picking up the tab for workers, for employers who are not paying their fair share into the system.\"\n\nEven with workers' compensation coverage, couriers like Eddie Lewis still struggle to make ends meet.

But seasoned remote workers and an economist who studies productivity said there's still a negative perception that stands in the way of making those arrangements happen.\n\nGlenn Dutcher, an assistant professor of economics at Ohio University, studies the impact of telecommuting on productivity. He and his research colleagues have found that many people still doubt that remote workers get as much done at home as they would in an office environment.\n\nIn an experiment that explored how telecommuting affects groups where some employees work in the office and others work from home, Dutcher found that productivity of the whole team hinges on whether office-based workers think their remote colleagues are getting things done.\n\n\"The results were pretty consistent. However we looked at it, we found that if they believed that telecommuters were less productive, then they contributed less work themselves,\" said Dutcher.\n\nConversely, if those same subjects trusted their remote colleagues were hard at work, then they worked hard, too.\n\nGlenn Dutcher, assistant professor at Ohio University's department of economics, found that workers perform better on creative tasks when allowed to complete them outside of an office environment. (Suppled by Glenn Dutcher)\n\nAnswering the question of whether telecommuting affects team output is critical, the study authors said. Despite mounting evidence in favour of telecommuting \u2014 from better employee retention to lower costs for office space \u2014 managers still have reservations about allowing employees to work outside the office.\n\nSubtracting the commute\n\nThat's a missed opportunity, said Aiman Attar, who has worked from home for 16 years both for herself and others. She now employs three home-based full-time staffers for her real estate recruiting business AgentC, as well as a number of regular contractors.\n\nAttar said she gets more from her staff, not less, by letting them avoid a time-consuming commute.\n\n\"They're not coming into work stressed from driving, traffic, weather, accidents on the road,\" said Attar. \"You get up, you can take your morning walk, have your shower or your breakfast, and then sit at your desk. The time that you save allows you to do more productive things with yourself. You can spend it on eating healthy; you can spend it on working out.\"\n\nShe said it's a mistake to let trust issues get in the way of letting good candidates work from home. \"You can't go into a relationship with that kind of negative mindset.

If you expect that someone is going to be productive eight hours of the day, you're wrong; it's never going to happen in any environment.\"\n\nDutcher said that a trusting attitude toward remote workers goes a long way. \"Managers have a great deal of influence over the perception of the workers that are working under them.\" Influence that perception of remote workers positively and team productivity won't be negatively affected, he said\n\nSome tasks better completed away from the cubicle\n\nIn an earlier study published in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, Dutcher and his colleagues found that some tasks are better suited to telecommuting than others.\n\nThis experiment found that so-called dull tasks \u2014 in this case, entering lines of numbers and letters into a computer \u2014 were better suited to office environments, said Dutcher. Subjects who were allowed to complete this task from anywhere they chose were less productive than those in the office, perhaps because \u2014 when faced with a mind-numbing task \u2014folding a load of laundry starts to look pretty good.\n\nBut when it came to the experiment's creative tasks \u2014 coming up with lists of alternate uses for everyday objects \u2014 these same workers performed better when given the opportunity to get away from the cubicle, Dutcher said.\n\nGiven that many employees do a mix of office and remote work, he said, \"it probably makes a lot of sense to do the creative work at home and the more mundane boring tasks in the office.\"\n\nThat fits with Wayne Cuervo's experience working for tech giant Cisco for 16 years, where \"there's a culture of empowerment\" around letting staff work from anywhere.

But those changes also have added tens of billions of dollars to the U.S. deficit \u2014 something Canadian officials say they want to avoid.\n\nInstead, any changes to Canada's capital cost allowance rules would be \"balanced\" and \"fiscally responsible,\" said the source, speaking on background.\n\nEver since U.S. President Donald Trump slashed his country's corporate tax rate late last year and accelerated its capital investment write-offs for businesses, pressure has been mounting on Morneau to make similar moves to keep Canadian firms competitive.\n\nWhile Canada's combined federal/provincial corporate tax rate is no longer lower than the U.S. rate, Morneau has maintained the federal portion of it is still competitive. He's also suggested that when Canada did have a much lower corporate rate, it did little to boost business investment.\n\nNo GST hike planned\n\nBut business groups also have pushed Morneau to match Washington's new rules on capital investment write-offs. Trump's new rules mean U.S. businesses are now able to claim 100 per cent of their capital investments right away for assets that have a useful life of less than 20 years.\n\nIn Canada, capital assets are divided into different classes, with different rates of write-offs. Machinery and equipment used in manufacturing and processing receive write-offs of between 30 and 50 per cent over time periods that range from three years up to the lifetime of the asset, depending on the type of equipment and when it was purchased.\n\nA consultant's report drafted for the Business Council of Canada suggested matching the U.S. on its tax changes and paying for it by raising the GST. That's not an option the government is willing to consider, said the source.\n\n\"We're not going to take money from the executive assistant and give it to the CEO.\"\n\nMatching the U.S. tax changes without raising revenue elsewhere would cost the government of Canada about $30 billion over five years, said the source.\n\n\"We're not going to do that,\" said the source.\n\nIt's not clear whether that means Canada's new rules will offer a 100 per cent write-off over a longer period of time, or a write-off of less than 100 per cent over a shorter period of time.\n\nThe Trudeau government's new measures could also target only certain kinds of capital assets. However, the source said the new rules will apply across all sectors of the economy, to avoid putting the government in the position of picking winners and losers.\n\n\"The priority is businesses that have a choice of investing north of the border or south of the border. We looked at what has changed for them (because of the U.S. tax changes) and looked at what we can do to address that,\" said the source.\n\nMoving beyond the American market\n\nThe fiscal update also will include measures on trade as the Trudeau government looks to diversify Canada's foreign markets to reduce its dependence on the United States, which remains Canada's biggest trading partner. The recent tumultuous NAFTA renegotiation talks, and the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed on Canada by Washington under a little-used 'national security' rule, have driven home for the federal government how important it is for Canada to spread out its export footprint.\n\nThe trade section in the fiscal update will also deal in part with fostering freer trade within Canada. Ottawa has been talking with provincial finance and trade ministers about reducing interprovincial trade barriers over the past year.\n\nThe update also will touch on regulations and promoting competitiveness.\n\nMorneau is expected to use the update to repeat the government's message that Canada's economy is strong, and that with the greater trade certainty offered by the negotiation of the new North American trade deal, USMCA, Canadians should feel confident in the economy's ability to deliver jobs.\n\nOctober's annual financial report stated that the economy grew by three per cent in 2017. The Bank of Canada reported that in the second quarter of 2018, growth surged to 2.9 per cent from 1.4 per cent in the first quarter. And at six per cent, the unemployment rate is close to a 40-year low.\n\nCanada recorded a $19 billion deficit for 2017-2018, slightly lower than what was projected. In the last federal budget, the deficit was forecast to fall to $15.1 billion next year before shrinking to $9.3 billion by the 2022-23 fiscal year."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Lorenda Reddekopp", "title": "Ford's move to axe child advocate office 'a nightmare,' children's rights lawyer says", "description": "Child welfare advocates are critical of the Ontario government's announcement Thursday during its Fall Economic Statement that it was shutting down the Children and Youth Advocate's Office.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ford-s-move-to-axe-child-advocate-office-a-nightmare-children-s-rights-lawyer-says-1.4907142", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4907836.1542318918!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/suzan-fraser.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T09:00:00Z", "content": "Youth workers and lawyers are joining with the province's Children and Youth Advocate to call on the Ford government to reconsider its decision to cut the position.

And some believe this is a reminder that there are inherent flaws in journal publication.\n\nThe study was led by Ralph Keeling, a professor in the geosciences research division at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.\n\nUsing a novel method that measures oxygen and carbon dioxide in the air from around the world, the researchers concluded Earth's oceans are absorbing 60 per cent more heat than estimates by the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nI accept responsibility for these oversights. - Ralph Keeling, Scripps Institution of Oceanography\n\nSoon after it was published on Nov. 1, independent researcher Nic Lewis wrote there was a \"major problem\" with the study.

The new calculations are expected to bring the oceans' heat absorption rate more in line with IPCC estimates.\n\n\"These problems do not invalidate the methodology or the new insights into ocean biogeochemistry on which it is based, but they do influence the mean rate of warming we infer, and more importantly, the uncertainties of that calculation,\" Keeling said in a response published on the website Real Climate.\n\n\"I accept responsibility for these oversights, because it was my role to ensure that details of the measurements were correctly understood and taken up by co-authors.\"\n\nNature says it's looking into the matter \"carefully.\"\n\n\"We take all concerns related to papers we have published very seriously and will issue an update once further information is available,\" the weekly journal said in a statement to CBC News.\n\nImperfect system\n\nIvan Oransky, a health journalism professor at New York University and co-founder of Retraction Watch, a website that tracks errors in science journals, believes that, while the error was unfortunate for the authors, part of the issue lies in the amount of faith the public \u2014 and journalists \u2014 put in the peer-review process.\n\n\"Science is done by human beings,\" said Oransky. \"When we start to think about peer review as a magical process that, somehow you put in something that may have some issues, but somehow the peer reviewers find all the problems, and then we should trust everything that's peer reviewed, we're setting ourselves up for failure.\"\n\nHe still believes in the process, but says it's not the catch-all that scientists and journalists believe it is.\n\n\"We need to stop thinking\u2026 that just because something is peer-reviewed means that it's a Good Housekeeping seal of approval,\" Oransky said.\n\nIvan Oransky, a health journalism professor at New York University says the public and journalists put too much faith in the peer-review process. (CBC)\n\nAn important thing to consider, says Keeling, is that peer reviewers aren't necessarily equipped to carefully pore over calculations. They may not even be experts in that field, particularly if the paper spans different disciplines, as was the case with this one.\n\n\"It didn't get seen by every audience that should have seen it, so perhaps we should have sent it to some of these other audiences for review,\" Keeling told CBC News.\n\n\"That would perhaps be a lesson that I take from this: that particularly in a paper like this, it should have been circulated among other colleagues even informally. That would've been helpful.\"\n\nWith division running deep between climatologists and those who believe they are simply being alarmist, there's the danger that other studies will be dismissed as a result of this or any other study where an error has been made.\n\nBut Oransky says that it's hot-button topics \u2014 like climate change, vaccines or GMOs \u2014 that are usually scrutinized far more closely than other topics. This, he says, could be a good thing, but if errors are present, it doesn't invalidate the research or the issue.\n\n\"What happens now is, 'See? The climate change researchers made a mistake.' So you have this logical fallacy that everything that they've ever done is flawed and we can't trust any of it,\" Oransky said.\n\n\"Well, that's not true either.

He lives down the street from the rapper's new mansion in the Bridle Path neighbourhood.\n\n\"When the time comes and I know the dates, I'll walk over and ask him,\" he says.\n\nEven though the El Mocambo doesn't have an opening date, Wekerle promises that several generations of marquee names have already committed to playing the venue, including Ronnie Hawkins and Justin Bieber.\n\n\"I had Gene Simmons opening for New Years Eve, but I couldn't open it that quick,\" he says.\n\n\"But Kiss will be playing there.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Alberta takes historic step to abolish red tape in health care for First Nations children", "description": "Jordan's Principle is named after Jordan River Anderson, a five-year-old boy from Norway House Cree Nation in Manitoba who died in a Winnipeg hospital in 2005 after a dispute between provincial and federal governments over who would pay for his home care.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/trilateral-agreement-enshrines-jordans-principle-in-alberta-1.4907618", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4908029.1542323666!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/jordan-s-principle.png", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:03:59Z", "content": "Alberta became the first province Thursday to commit to fully implementing Jordan's Principle, an agreement intended to end funding squabbles over who pays the health care bills for First Nations' children.

When he was two, doctors said he could move into a special home but the provincial and federal governments could not agree on who would pay for his home-based care. As a result, the boy remained in hospital, where he died in 2005 at age five.\n\n\"It is too bad that Jordan River Anderson had to die,\" Bigstone Cree Nation Chief Clara Moberly said.\n\n\"But because of his sacrifice, finally, we see the fiduciary responsibility of government starting to be met. Finally, we can see positive steps to eliminate the inequality ... that our people have suffered.\"\n\nMoberly noted that many First Nations people feel strongly that treaty relationships are with the federal \u2014 not provincial \u2014 government. But Thursday's signing ceremony, she said, is about creating a new collaborative effort \"to achieve more and be more effective for the children.\n\n\"We can't keep arguing amongst each other,\" she said. \"We have to do this for our children because it's getting pretty hard out there.\"\n\nFrom left: Tyler White, president of the First Nations Health Consortium, Senator Patti LaBoucane-Benson, Alberta Children's Services Minister Danielle Larivee and Federal Indigenous Services Minister Jane Philpott. (Alberta Government/Supplied)\n\nDanielle Larivee, Alberta minister of children's services, said she first became aware of Jordan's Principle 10 years ago when she was working as a nurse.\n\n\"Today is an important day for First Nations children and families, and for Alberta as a whole,\" she said. \"Every child deserves the same chance at a happy and healthy life, no matter where they are born or where they live.\"\n\nThe ceremony in Edmonton was treated as a celebration, including a grand entry, drummers, singers and youth dancers. The memorandum of understanding was signed by Larivee, Philpott and officials representing the First Nations Health Consortium, an organization created in 2017 to implement Jordan's Principle.\n\nUnder the agreement, the department that is first contacted will pay for the service and can later seek reimbursement.\n\nBetween July 2016 and Sept. 30, 2018, a total of 165,000 health requests were approved across Canada for First Nations children under Jordan's Principle. Of those, 8,129 were approved in Alberta.\n\nRequests include mental health supports, medical equipment, speech therapy, education supports and more.\n\nIn June, Larivee announced plans to create a new system to deal with child interventions in Alberta. The full implementation of Jordan's Principle was identified as one of the first actions to be undertaken.\n\nPhilpott thanked Alberta for stepping forward to enshrine the principle in Alberta's health care processes.\n\n\"This first-of-its-kind trilateral agreement sits at the heart of what Jordan's Principle is meant to achieve,\" she said in the news release. \"This ensures that all orders of government and First Nation partners are working together to support First Nations children and families.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Ronald Blum", "title": "Red Sox's Mookie Betts caps off winning year with MVP award", "description": "Boston's Mookie Betts and Milwaukee's Christian Yelich were runaway winners of the Most Valuable Player awards after the 26-year-old outfielders each led their teams to first-place finishes with dominant seasons that included batting titles.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/mlb/mlb-awards-mvp-christian-yelich-mookie-betts-1.4908049", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4908099.1542325119!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/betts-mookie-111518.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-16T00:02:07Z", "content": "Boston's Mookie Betts and Milwaukee's Christian Yelich were runaway winners of the Most Valuable Player awards after the 26-year-old outfielders each led their teams to first-place finishes with dominant seasons that included batting titles.

I've kind of used this pedestal or whatever you want to say to spread knowledge that the game is fun,\" he said Thursday after his runaway victory for the AL MVP award.\n\nMilwaukee's Christian Yelich was close to a unanimous pick for the NL honour. A 26-year-old outfielder just like Betts, Yelich also won a batting championship and led his team to a division title. But while Betts has been with the Red Sox since he signed after the 2011 amateur draft, Yelich didn't join the Brewers until he was dealt to Milwaukee last January by the payroll-paring Miami Marlins.\n\n\"I'm thankful it all worked out because being traded, you never know how it's going to be,\" Yelich said. \"Luckily for myself, it all went amazing.\"\n\nYelich is signed through 2021 and his deal includes a team option for the following season. Betts didn't want to speculate whether he would be a Red Sox lifer, like former Boston MVPs Ted Williams, Carl Yastrzemski and Jim Rice. Betts can become a free agent after the 2020 season.\n\n\"Right now I'm just focusing on the 2019 season coming up,\" he said.\n\nRunaway victors\n\nBetts received 28 first-place votes and 410 points from the Baseball Writers' Association of America.\n\nLos Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout, a two-time MVP, followed with one first-place vote and 265 points. Trout tied the record of four second-place finishes shared by Stan Musial, Williams and Albert Pujols. Trout won in 2014 and 2016, finished second in '12, '13 and '15, and was fourth in 2017.\n\nBetts hit a major league-leading .346 with 32 homers, 80 RBIs, 42 doubles and 30 stolen bases as the leadoff hitter for the Red Sox, who won a team-record 108 games and their fourth World Series title in 15 seasons. Votes were submitted before the postseason.\n\nBetts, second to Trout in the 2016 vote, raised his profile when he fed homeless people on the steps of Boston's Public Library after the second game of the World Series. Unlike some baseball players, he doesn't eschew off-the-field limelight. Commissioner Rob Manfred criticized Trout during the All-Star Game for not making enough of a marketing effort.\n\n\"I definitely think it's pretty cool in some settings,\" he said, \"and in some setting settings I just kind of want to be with my family.\"\n\nBoth batting champions won MVP awards for the first time since San Francisco's Buster Posey and Detroit's Miguel Cabrera in 2012.\n\nNear Triple Crown\n\nYelich got 29 first-place votes and 415 points, and the other first-place vote went to New York Mets pitcher Jacob deGrom, the NL Cy Young Award winner, who finished fifth. Chicago Cubs infielder Javier Baez was second with 250 points, followed by Colorado third baseman Nolan Arenado with 203.\n\nYelich won the first batting title in Brewers history with a .326 average. He set career highs with 36 homers and 110 RBIs and had a 1.000 OPS.\n\n.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChristianYelich?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ChristianYelich</a> turned up the heat in the 2nd half \u2026<br><br>He led all <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MLB?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MLB</a> qualifiers in AVG (.367), SLG (.770) & OPS (1.219) post-ASB. <a href=\"https://t.co/26xZf7oCxV\">pic.twitter.com/26xZf7oCxV</a> \u2014@MLBStatoftheDay\n\nYelich nearly became the NL's first Triple Crown winner since Joe Medwick in 1937, finishing two homers shy of Arenado and one RBI back of Baez. Yelich was especially impressive in the second half, hitting .367 with 25 homers and 67 RBIs \u2014 including 11 homers in August and 10 in September.\n\nMilwaukee reached the playoffs for the first time in seven years, swept Colorado in the Division Series then lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in a seven-game League Championship Series, falling one win short of its first World Series appearance since 2002.\n\nYelich gets a $100,000 bonus for winning, and the price of the 2022 team option in his contract increased by $1 million to $16 million.\n\nYelich celebrated in Southern California with family and friends, including Heisman Trophy winner and Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield. Yelich is from Westlake Village, California, near the site of a recent mass shooting and the Southern California wildfires. He wore a Los Angeles Fire Department cap during TV interviews.\n\n\"Almost everyone had to be evacuated, just from the Thousand Oaks, Westlake, Malibu area,\" he said. \"We were fortunate enough to make it with no damage, A lot of people, unfortunately, were not able to say the same.\""}]
