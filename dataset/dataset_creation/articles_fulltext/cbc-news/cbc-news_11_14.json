People send him stories about their loved ones and he selects one for a portrait.\n\nThomas relaxes in his Fort McMurray studio. (Supplied/Joey Podlubny)\n\nThat first year, at the request of a distant relative, Thomas painted a military chaplain who served during the Second World War.\n\n\"I painted the portrait and sent it off to the chaplain's daughter in Prince Edward Island. She didn't know it was coming,\" he said. Weeks later, he received \"the most touching letter.\"\n\n\"She said she and her sister talk to it when it's hanging up on the wall, and it's like he's there with them again. So it's such an honour to be able to play that role and help people get closer to the loved ones they've lost.\"\n\nThis year, Thomas painted Pte. Beaton Tulk, who served in WW II, but died of a massive heart attack at the age of 44, after he had returned home. He left behind a wife and five children.\n\nThe portrait is now in the mail, headed to Gander, N.L., where Tulk's widow lives.\n\nJustin Trudeau drops by\n\nThomas's introduction as an artist began with a bang when his portrait of Yanick earned a visit from then federal opposition leader Justin Trudeau.\n\nThomas had met Yanick at community events where the elder would pray and was inspired by her kind spirit and generous mentorship.\n\nA few weeks after Thomas painted the mural, Trudeau came to town to canvas with the local Liberal candidate. Thomas playfully invited him to take a #selfiewithelsie in front of the mural \u2014 and Trudeau agreed.\n\nJustin Trudeau, as leader of the opposition in 2014, poses with Thomas, his wife and son, along with local Liberal candidate Kyle Harrietha.

I never tried to re-create something based on what it's actual colour is; it was more about the colour I wanted to give it although, I don't know if I'm as wild as when I first started.\"\n\nRussell has donated works to many, including the families of the four people who died in a 2016 shooting in La Loche, Sask.\n\nHe still corresponds with the mother of the two boys gunned down.

Outside of those hours, pilots have the ability to control lights on airport's longest runway so they can safely land in the dark.\n\nBy pressing the push to talk switch on their radio a specific number of times [generally 3,5 or 7] within a certain time period, pilots can activate the lights and control their intensity, according to Krepski.\n\nHe added the TSB is aware of the audio recordings and will be \"taking a closer look,\" although at this point officials don't know who was doing the clicking.\n\n\"It's too early to say what they mean, whether or not it was the aircraft in question that activated or another aircraft or ground station that activated them or there were multiple attempts to activate due to a malfunction in the system.\"\n\nThe longest runway at the Brantford airport has lights that can be remotely activated by a pilot at night, according to the TSB. (Google Maps)\n\nHe added, \"based on the information we have been able to gather, the lights were on at the time of the crash.\"\n\nThe TSB has quarantined the aircraft and plan to bring it to a facility in Richmond Hill for further examination.\n\n\"We're still getting information together about pilot training and aircraft maintenance, more information about weather \u2026and radar,\" said Krepski.\n\nA 'diligent pilot' who loved his plane\n\nThe crash has shaken the local flying community, especially at the Burlington airport, where Ronald Chamberlain kept his plane.\n\nTim Crawford, a pilot manages business for the airport, said he was \"cross-taxiway neighbours\" with Chamberlain and knew him since 1995.\n\n\"He loved flying and he was an accomplished pilot,\" he said. \"Everyone in the airport community is just shaking their heads, trying to figure out what could have possibly happened to make things end up so tragically.\"\n\nCrawford describes Chamberlain as a \"diligent pilot\" who loved flying so much he'd often take his wife up just for fun.\n\nRonald Chamberlain is shown with his Piper Arrow during a COPA For Kids event in 2015. (copaflight26.com)\n\nThe veteran pilot also made a name for himself at the airport as an active member of the Canadian Owners and Pilots Association (COPA) For Kids program. Chamberlain said they'd volunteer their time and take dozens of kids on flights.\n\n\"Everybody is struggling to deal with the loss.\"\n\nDown on the tarmac, other pilots would sometimes gently tease Chamberlain by pronouncing his plane's call sign \u2014 C-GDUM \u2014 as Charlie, Golf, Dumb. But that plane was his pride and joy.\n\n\"It was immaculate,\" said Crawford. \"It was a fabulous airplane. That was his baby.\"\n\nBrantford a popular stop\n\nNow Crawford is struggling to understand how such an experienced pilot could crash at a familiar airport.\n\nBrantford is home to a restaurant that makes it a popular place for area pilots to stop in for a bowl of soup or a burger, he explained. Chamberlain would probably have flown there \"a thousand times.\"\n\nCrawford has flown there himself on countless occasion and said he's even used the remote lights at night.\n\nTuesday night was cloudy, snowy and moonless. Crawford said he can't understand why Chamerblain would try to land there.\n\n\"No pilot would ever try to make an approach into an unlit airport. It's just not something people do,\" he said. \"Hamilton airport is literally 15 or 17 nautical miles away from Brantford.

While driving along Monkland \u200bAvenue in Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ce, he noticed a swastika painted on a concrete block.\n\nFleischer kept on driving but when he got to the job site, he couldn't shake the regret he felt by doing nothing about the griffiti.\n\nHe told the owner of the house that his machine had broken down and that he'd return tomorrow to finish the work.\n\n\"I went back to Monkland and I erased my first swastika.\"\n\nDozens of hate crimes\n\nHate incidents in Montreal are not uncommon. According to the Montreal police service, so far this year 172 hate crimes have been reported \u2014 71 of those were related to religion. Most of those incidents, 36 of them, were directed at Jews while 33 of them were towards Muslims.\n\nLast year's figures were higher. Montreal police handled 250 reported hate crimes. Of those, 59 were directed towards Muslims and 42 were anti-Semitic.\n\nFleischer is now working at taking his movement global.\n\nIn the coming weeks he plans to release an Erasing Hate app that would let anyone with an iOs or Android smartphone report hate graffiti.\n\nThe app would allow users to send photos and the geolocation of hate graffiti to Fleischer, who would then use his social media presence to find volunteers to remove it.\n\nAlready he's used his large social media following to inspire people to remove hate in Paris and Los Angeles.\n\n\"We remove hate anywhere in the world, free of charge.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Parents, safety group concerned after school district ditches motorcoaches for long trips", "description": "Coaches equipped with seatbelts are being dropped in favour of school buses without seatbelts.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/school-bus-policy-safety-concerns-1.4904814", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3883683.1481047793!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/coach-line-tour-bus.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T23:00:00Z", "content": "Parents in the province are concerned that a new Newfoundland and Labrador English School District busing policy will put their children at risk.

(CBC)\n\nLong said ahead of news of Gallant's announcement that he would not run for the leadership if the race began before next year's federal election, when he plans to run for a second term as MP.\n\nHolt said she's merely responding to Liberals calling her to urge her to think about it.\n\n\"I'm not going to rush into a 'yes' if it doesn't feel like a 'yes.'\"\n\nGallant admitted he was 'jaded'\n\nIn his closing speech before the confidence vote Nov. 2 and again at a news conference later that day and in opinion articles in newspapers, Gallant apologized for not doing a better job as premier.\n\nHe acknowledged that he won the leadership promising \"a new approach\" but became \"too jaded and fell into some of the old adversarial ways of this place.\"\n\nPremier Brian Gallant delivers his speech at the closure of the throne speech debate on Nov. 2. Gallant's Liberal government was defeated and the party leader will now resign from the post. (James West/Canadian Press)\n\nHe said the election result was a wake-up call and he would try to be more collaborative \"no matter which position I'll be occupying.\"\n\nLong and Holt are just two names circulating among Liberals as potential leadership candidates.\n\nLiberal MLAs Roger Melanson and Beno\u00ee\u200b\u200bt Bourque, also seen as possible candidates, did not respond to interview requests Wednesday.\n\nMayor not interested\n\nFormer MLA Donald Arseneault said he had \"no immediate plans as I am enjoying living in Fredericton and Ottawa and looking at politics from a different perspective.\"\n\nMoncton Mayor Dawn Arnold confirmed she has been approached.\n\n\"Yes, it has come up,\" she said in an email. \"However, I am fully committed to the City of Moncton and continuing to move our city forward.\"\n\nFederal Health Minister Ginette Petitpas-Taylor didn't respond to a request for comment on whether she'd jump into provincial politics."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "1 person taken to hospital after Wednesday afternoon fire", "description": "One person was taken to hospital in stable condition after a home fire in Winnipeg's Beaumont area Wednesday afternoon.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/saturn-bay-fire-single-family-home-1.4905953", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4785690.1534300599!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/winnipeg-firefighter.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T22:35:49Z", "content": "One person was taken to hospital in stable condition after a home fire in Winnipeg's Beaumont area Wednesday afternoon.

He's grabbed me, and I couldn't move.\"\n\n\"I didn't know what to do. I panicked a bit inside.\"\n\nThe woman said she started thinking about how to get out of the situation without making a scene.\n\n\"And then his hand moved, and it moved up. And so he put his hand under my arm and he grabbed me. At that point, I was somewhat relieved because I had a big bag over my left shoulder ... so that no one could see that he was groping me still.\"\n\nGraydon then propositioned her, she said.\n\n\"He just kept saying, 'Come back to my apartment' and that he doesn't have sex, he makes love,\" the woman said.\n\n\"So then I said, 'What about your wife, Cliff? I know her,' and he said something to the effect of, 'Never mind her' or 'Don't worry about her.\"'\n\n\"I kept trying to say 'no' in the politest way that I could think of, and I can't remember what made him let go eventually.\"\n\n'I just wanted him to go away'\n\nThe woman's detailed allegation was provided to Graydon by The Canadian Press. Graydon did not respond to numerous messages left via phone, text, email and social media. A woman who answered the phone at his constituency office said she could not provide any help or comment.\n\nGraydon, who recently admitted to making inappropriate comments to female staff, denied any inappropriate physical contact at a news conference earlier this month.\n\n\"I have not knowingly touched anyone inappropriately,\" he said at the time.\n\nNone of the allegations has been tested in a court and the woman has not filed a complaint with police.\n\nTwo other women alleged last month that Graydon had asked them to sit on his lap while they worked as staffers at the Manitoba Legislature. (CBC)\n\nShe said she saw Graydon a few weeks after the rooftop event.\n\n\"He said, 'I hope I didn't embarrass you the other night,' and I said \u2014well I lied \u2014 and I said, 'No, not at all,' because I felt slightly cornered ... and I just wanted him to go away.\"\n\nThe woman said she did not tell any Tory officials until February of this year, when Graydon was in the news for making social media comments about immigrants. That resulted in the party ordering him to undergo sensitivity training.\n\nIn a separate interview, a male colleague who is also a Progressive Conservative confirmed to The Canadian Press that the woman told him in February. He recounted details very similar to what the woman told the news agency.\n\n\"She told me that it was at a party function, that (Graydon) touched her in ways that made her very uncomfortable, that she felt she was trapped and couldn't leave the situation, that he invited her to his apartment, that she objected saying, 'What about your wife,\"' the man said.\n\n\"I was angry.\"\n\nParty officials informed of alleged comments\n\nThe woman and her male colleague both said party officials were informed \u2014 but only of the alleged comments, not of the alleged groping, at the request of the woman \u2014 and sensitivity training was expanded for Graydon, who represents the Emerson constituency.\n\n\"Disciplinary action was immediately taken to the satisfaction of the victim, including the member for Emerson apologizing and undergoing sensitivity training,\" Tory caucus chair Wayne Ewasko said in a written statement Wednesday.\n\nThe woman said she was pleased with the way things were handled.\n\n\"Honestly, I was satisfied after that because I noticed a change in (Graydon's) behaviour and I saw that he was more subdued, not as brash,\" she said.\n\n\"Throughout this whole thing (the Tories) have been, I felt, very protective of me.\"\n\nThe woman said she decided to come forward now because of the recent revelations that Graydon invited two young female staff members, on separate occasions, to sit on his knee. There was also a recent media report that Graydon invited one female staffer to lick food off his face. Graydon said he has no memory of saying such a thing.\n\nGraydon said at a news conference this month he is only guilty of having an outdated sense of humour.\n\n\"People who know me best can verify I have never been accused of anything remotely resembling sexual harassment,\" Graydon said at that news conference.\n\n\"I admit I'm guilty of having a bad sense of humour and sincerely apologize to those who have been offended by my inconsiderate jokes.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Phone scammers pretending to be police are targeting Winnipeggers, police warn", "description": "Winnipeg police are warning the public about phone scammers they believe are targeting local numbers, faking a credit card fraud investigation to swindle money from victims.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-phone-scam-police-1.4905906", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4612049.1535149461!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/cell-phone-with-laptop.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T22:31:52Z", "content": "Winnipeg police are warning the public about phone scammers they believe are targeting local numbers, faking a credit card fraud investigation to swindle money from victims.

The project is more than 90 per cent complete, with first power forecast for late 2019.

In between, he served a period as deputy minister of natural resources, the department that oversees government-owned Nalcor.\n\nFor years, the Lower Churchill Project was one of the most important files on his desk, but it appears some very important information about the cost and schedule for Muskrat was kept from him.\n\nOther government, and even Nalcor officials have delivered similar testimony at the inquiry.\n\nGovernment was simply accepting whatever Nalcor told you, with very little review.

It was news to me.\"\n\nAnd as he has suggested before, inquiry co-counsel Barry Learmonth said it's evidence that Thompson and others were \"naive\" and \"blindly accepting\" of the work being done by Nalcor in the lead-up to the sanctioning of the massive project.\n\nMuskrat has been described as the biggest gamble in the province's history, one that now includes a price tag of nearly $13 billion and uncertainty about how the large debt will be repaid.\n\nIn one of several testy exchanges throughout the day Learmonth said, \"Government was simply accepting whatever Nalcor told you, with very little review.

(Terry Roberts/CBC)\n\nLearmonth countered that government had a duty to scrutinize every move by Nalcor.\n\n'We did good work'\n\nThompson's testimony was similar to other government witnesses in that he said Nalcor was counted upon to provide accurate and timely information on everything from capital cost estimates and construction schedules to communications strategies with the public.\n\nThompson said government and Nalcor were an \"integrated\" team, and government accepted the estimates of Nalcor, just as it would if an independent engineer had provided cost estimates for a new hospital.\n\n\"We were relying at that point on the quality of the work that was going on within the project team in Nalcor and we were satisfied with the kinds of assurances we were being provided,\" Thompson testified.\n\nThompson disagreed with Learmonth's assertion that government was naive in its handling of Nalcor.\n\nHe said there were numerous independent reviews and there were constant meetings between senior government and Nalcor officials.\n\n\"We felt we were doing a credible job in providing independent oversight on the project at that time,\" he said.\n\nAs for the omission of the strategic reserve and the high-risk schedule for first power, answers to these questions are expected later in the inquiry when people like former Nalcor CEO Ed Martin and others are called to the witness stand.\n\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "5 charged after recovery of powwow regalia stolen from Alberta family in Saskatoon", "description": "Most of an Alberta family's valued powwow regalia has been recovered and five people have been charged, after the regalia \u2014 including custom-made jingle dresses \u2014 was stolen in Saskatoon late last month.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/stolen-jingle-dresses-charges-1.4905745", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4888010.1541098943!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/stolen-dresses.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T21:38:34Z", "content": "Most of an Alberta family's valued powwow regalia has been recovered and five people have been charged, after the regalia including custom-made jingle dresses was stolen in Saskatoon late last month.

(Evan Mitsui/CBC)\n\nAsked what he hopes will be the key takeaway from his book, Brown said he wants to expand people's views on the current form of conservatism.\n\n\"I believe you can be a proud, progressive conservative who cares about gay rights and cares about the environment and have a social conscience,\" said Brown.\n\n\"I believe there is a place within conservatism for that Bill Davis style of politics.

Last September, MacDonald was acquitted of seven of the eight drug charges. He was found guilty of the eighth count, a lesser charge of possession of a controlled substance.\n\nDuring the trial, clips from surveillance video in the home showed images of the police officer which raised concerns about theft.\n\nA hidden camera captured the moment an Abbotsford police officer says he took money from a suspect\u2019s home and placed it in his sock as part of a joke, while carrying out a search warrant. 0:45\n\nMacDonald accused the officer of stealing cash, and his lawyer requested the trafficking charges be dropped.

The minister met with Alberta leaders this week and has an upcoming meeting with chiefs in Quebec.\n\nOttawa still plans to push ahead with policy changes around comprehensive claims \u2014 also known as modern treaties \u2014and additions to reserve lands which is currently a cumbersome and lengthy process.\n\n\"The legislative and policy reforms we are committed to will get Ottawa out of the way so that Indigenous nations and governments can accelerate their path to self-determination,\" said Bennett's statement.\n\nTrudeau announced his government's intention to table legislation to create the framework during a Feb. 14 speech in the House of Commons.\n\nHe said that in order to \"truly renew the relationship between Canada and Indigenous peoples\" Ottawa needed to \"recognize and implement Indigenous rights.\"\n\nTrudeau said this required a \"government-wide shift in how we do things.\"\n\nNeeds to be led by First Nations\n\nThe Assembly of First Nations in July called for a pause and recalibration of the process to develop the framework which aimed to provide a path for First Nations to get out from under the 1876 Indian Act and create their own governance structures.\n\nAFN National Chief Perry Bellegarde sent a letter to Bennett on Wednesday again urging the minister to change the existing approach on developing the framework.\n\n\"The lines and directions of our chiefs are quite clear that only First Nations can determine the path to decolonization and reconciliation,\" said Bellegarde, in an interview with CBC News. \"We all want to move beyond the Indian Act, but that will take some time.\"\n\nBellegarde said he wants to government to move forward on changes on issues like comprehensive claims and additions to reserve land.\n\n\"There are pieces that can happen so we want to move our energy and efforts to those things,\" he said.\n\nFormer AFN national chief candidate Russ Diabo, who has organized opposition to the framework, said he has no plans to pull back from the campaign.\n\n\"Our grassroots campaign needs to be stepped up to convince the federal government to acknowledge their mistake in conducting a secret, top-down approach to a new 'nation-to-nation' relationship,\" said Diabo.\n\nCheryl Casimer, a member of the First Nation Summit task group in B.C., said it was \"a bit disappointing\" the promise on the framework will be delayed.\n\nCasimer said the main problem emerged with Ottawa's discussion paper which failed to reflect input from over 100 engagement sessions between First Nations, Bennett and federal officials.\n\n\"Many nations did not see themselves reflected in that document, including B.C,\" said Casimer, whose organization submitted drafting instructions to Bennett's office on how the framework should look.\n\n\"It's not so much First Nations are opposed to the framework itself, because there is no framework...there is no draft, there is nothing.\"\n\nMary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a director of the University of British Columbia's Indian Residential School History and Dialogue Centre, said the federal government needs to take a hard look at how it approached the framework's development.\n\n\"There are going to be some hard questions as to what is going on here,\" said Turpel-Lafond. \"Leaving it in abeyance is not enough of a plan.

Sign up here to get it delivered directly to your inbox every weekday.\n\nHere's what you need to know right now from the world of sports:\n\nCalgary said no to the Olympics \u2014 so what now?\n\nThe people of Calgary have spoken, and they don't want the Olympics. 56.4 per cent of voters in yesterday's plebiscite said they're against the city continuing to pursue a bid for the 2026 Winter Games. It would have been the second time Calgary hosted. In 1988, it was the stage for the Jamaican bobsleigh team, Eddie the Eagle and the Battle of the Brians.\n\nWhat's next for Calgary?\n\nThe plebiscite result is non-binding, so the city council still has to officially kill the bid. But that will almost certainly happen in a vote on Monday. \"This is very clear direction for where we go from here,\" said mayor Naheed Nenshi, who was in favour of the Olympics.\n\nIt's possible Calgary could try for another one down the road, but it would take a lot of work to change the minds of citizens and the council. Both were pretty sharply divided on the 2026 bid.\n\nSports-wise, the next big thing for Calgary is figuring out what to do about the Saddledome. It's the oldest arena in the NHL if you don't count Madison Square Garden, which got a billion-dollar reno a few years ago. The Flames have threatened to move if they don't get a new building, but Calgary doesn't want to foot too much of the bill for it.\n\nWill Canada host the Olympics anytime soon?\n\nThe next available Olympics are in 2030, and no Canadian cities have expressed interest yet. Besides Calgary, Toronto (2024) and Quebec City (2026) kicked the tires on bids before bailing pretty early in the process. Montreal? Still licking its wounds from the financial disaster that was 1976. Vancouver still has a lot of the facilities for a Winter Olympics, but would it want to host again so soon after 2010? Beijing is doing it 14 years apart, though, so it's not impossible.\n\nWhat do the Olympics do now?\n\nCalgary's rejection is a big blow to the International Olympic Committee. The only two candidates left for 2026 are Stockholm and a joint Italian bid involving Milan and the alpine region of Cortina d'Ampezzo. Both are trying to overcome a lack of support from governments that don't want to spend taxpayer money on the Olympics.\n\nThat points to the IOC's larger, more existential problem: fewer and fewer places want to host the Olympics. Going back to Beijing gave off an air of desperation, and when both L.A. and Paris expressed interest in 2024, the IOC took the unprecedented step of awarding them both a Games (L.A. got 2028) before they could change their minds. The IOC has tried to make hosting more palatable by encouraging more austere bids. So far, it doesn't seem to be working.\n\nThe \"yes\" side didn't get the answer it wanted from Calgary voters. (Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press)\n\nQuickly...\n\nAn old boys club got a little less boys-y. The Hockey Hall of Fame added Cassie Campbell-Pascall to its selection committee, making her the first woman in that role. The former Team Canada star, who's now a broadcaster on Hockey Night in Canada, isn't in the Hall of Fame herself. But she's considered a lock to someday get the call.\n\nSouth Korea's Olympic darlings say they were abused. The women's curling team, nicknamed the Garlic Girls, became a national sensation en route to winning a surprise silver medal on home ice back in February. Now the five women are accusing a former Korean curling official of verbal abuse. They also say their coaches held back prize money and tried to sideline their captain after she got married this summer and they found out she planned to start a family. The coaching staff has denied the allegations and an investigation is underway.\n\nDwane Casey is back in Toronto. The Raptors fired Casey last spring after another early playoff exit\u2026 then saw him win the NBA's coach of the year award a few weeks later. Casey landed on his feet in Detroit, and tonight he returns to Toronto as head coach of the 6-6 Pistons. The Raptors are doing just fine without him, off to a 12-2 start under rookie head coach Nick Nurse.\n\nThere's trouble in NBA paradise. They've won two consecutive titles, and another is probably on the way this spring. So why isn't the NBA's best team happy? The Warriors suspended defensive ace Draymond Green for one game after his on-court shouting match with teammate Kevin Durant reportedly escalated in the locker room. Durant can become a free agent after this season, and there was already speculation before this incident that he'll leave Golden State.\n\nOne of football's biggest stars has chosen to sit out the season. All-Pro running back Le'Veon Bell had until late yesterday to accept a one-year, $14.4 million US offer from the Pittsburgh Steelers or else miss the entire year. The deadline passed, and Bell will have a chance to land the long-term contract he wants when he becomes a free agent in a few months. A similar situation is playing out in the NHL, where William Nylander is holding out for a better deal from the Leafs.\n\nThe NFL bailed on its game in Mexico City. A potential Super Bowl preview between the Rams and Chiefs this Monday night was moved out of Azteca Stadium because of poor field conditions. Some players reportedly even said they'd refuse to play for fear of being injured. The game will be played in the Rams' stadium in L.A. instead.\n\nYou're up to speed.

Her treating witness A the same as witness B is what I had asked,\" said Giorno.\n\nHe did not elaborate on how those issues now were being addressed.\n\nConservative Party to release report\n\nA spokesperson for the Conservative Party of Canada said that the report itself will be made public.\n\n\"At this time the review remains with the independent third party reviewer we tasked with conducting it, and we'll release the report once it's been completed,\" said Cory Hann, the party's director of communications.\n\n\"The goal of the review remains the same \u2014 to determine the circumstances around Mr. Dykstra's candidacy and to make any recommendations on establishing a protocol for this type of situation that could aid the 2019 campaign team.\"\n\nThe Dykstra affair drove a wedge through the campaigning Conservative Party. Internal campaign e-mails obtained by Maclean's suggested Dykstra's candidacy was the subject of fierce disagreement among members of the team.\n\nFormer prime minister Stephen Harper even issued a rare public statement, saying that when the allegation against Dykstra was brought to his attention during the 2015 campaign, he \"understood that the matter had been investigated by the police and closed a year prior.\"\n\n\"Given this understanding of the situation, I did not believe that I could justify removing him as a candidate,\" Harper said.\n\n\"Recently, much more information has come to light, including information to the effect that the original investigation may not have been complete. In my view, it is essential that criminal allegations, including this one, be fully investigated and prosecuted if warranted.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Muriel Draaisma", "title": "ROM plans 'Dawn of Life' gallery to tell story of earliest life on Earth", "description": "Toronto's Royal Ontario Museum announced plans on Wednesday to create a \"Dawn of Life\" gallery that will tell the story of earliest life on Earth.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/royal-ontario-museum-dawn-of-life-gallery-early-collection-1.4905326", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4905375.1542221922!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/eusthenopteron.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T20:54:21Z", "content": "Toronto's Royal Ontario Museum announced plans on Wednesday to create a \"Dawn of Life\" gallery that will tell the story of the earliest life on Earth.

The last time Sandra Wakeham worked as a clerk for the department\u2026 [+3556 chars]", "fulltext": "Nova Scotia's highest court has overturned a decision by a provincial human rights board that awarded damages to a woman who couldn't do her job at the provincial Department of the Environment.\n\nThe last time Sandra Wakeham worked as a clerk for the department was on March 9, 2012. She left her job, never to return. She claimed the department failed to accommodate her physical disabilities. A human rights board of inquiry agreed and awarded her $51,000 for loss of past income and $35,000 in general damages.\n\nBut in a ruling released Wednesday, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal said the board of inquiry got it wrong when it found that Wakeham's inability to work was linked to the department's failure to accommodate her.\n\nAccording to evidence at both the inquiry hearing and the appeal hearing, Wakeham's problems began with two car accidents; one in 1999 and the other in 2005. She missed three years of work following the first accident. By 2006, she had pain issues and was consulting about 10 medical specialists.\n\nBeginning in 2009, Wakeham experienced lengthy absences from her job. According to figures supplied to the court by the Environment Department, Wakeham worked 90 per cent of the time in 2008. By 2010, that had slipped to less than 44 per cent. And for the period from April 2011 to February 2012, she was at work only about 10 per cent of the time.\n\nAccommodations\n\nWakeham's family physician filled out forms listing limitations that should be in place for her patient's return to work. She noted Wakeham had reduced ability when it came to sitting, standing, walking, bending/twisting, lifting, carrying, reaching, pushing or pulling.\n\nIn order to accommodate Wakeham, the department agreed to place her in a job with the following restrictions:\n\nNo responding to customers at the front desk.\n\nExclusion of telephone duties.\n\nWork in a quiet location.\n\nSitting for no more than two hours without a break.\n\nNo standing for more than 30 minutes without a break.\n\nNo walking more than one hour without a break.\n\nMaximum lifting of five pounds.\n\nWareham told the department that she developed anxiety because the new restrictions meant she would have to learn new job skills. At any rate, she didn't last long before she was off the job again.\n\nIn appealing the human rights board's decision, the department argued that it was contradictory for the board to find Wakeham was fit to work one day and then unfit a couple of weeks later when she complained about the way the department was treating her.\n\nMedical experts\n\nThe court found the board put too much emphasis on findings made by Wakeham's family physician, even though those findings had no foundation in fact.\n\nThe court said the board failed to consider evidence from medical experts hired by the department to review this case, including forensic psychiatrist Scott Theriault and occupational health physician Kevin Bourke.\n\nIn his review of the case, Theriault found that \"with respect to her cognitive issues I do not see anything that could successfully allow Ms. Wakeham to perform the basic functions of her job, even with accommodation.\"\n\nBourke was equally pessimistic.\n\n\"The likelihood of this employee's successful return to even part-time in her previous role(s) is exceedingly small in my opinion,\" he wrote. \"I have no recommendations in this regard.\"\n\nThe court found the human rights board also failed to weigh whether Wakeham was trying to return to work for financial reasons, because her long absences had exhausted much of her disability payments.\n\nThe court was also critical of Wakeham and the board for the long, drawn-out hearing process in this case.\n\n\"Careful expenditure of scarce public resources would suggest a better solution than the process pursued in this case,\" Justice Peter Bryson wrote for the three-member appeal panel."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Shots fired through front window injure 21-year-old woman", "description": "A 21-year-old woman was injured early Tuesday in a shooting at a home in Somerville, about 20 kilometres north of Woodstock.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/rcmp-investigate-shooting-incident-somerville-1.4905444", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4823257.1536975851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/rcmp.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T19:55:28Z", "content": "A 21-year-old woman was injured early Tuesday in a shooting at a home in Somerville, about 20 kilometres north of Woodstock.

Watch it here.\n\nThe Cold War heats up\n\nThis past weekend in Paris, French authorities did their best to keep Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin apart.\n\nA planned meeting, on the sidelines of the gathering of world leaders to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, was scrubbed at the request of the hosts \u2014 apparently due to concerns that it might overshadow the solemn ceremonies.\n\nAnd the seating arrangements for a working lunch at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace were reportedly changed at the last minute to stop the presidents of Russia and the United States from chatting over the meal of chicken, lobster, and potatoes from the former battlefields of the Somme.\n\nIn the end, the pair had to settle for a quick grip and grin at the Arc de Triomphe, and a promise to sit down together at the G20 summit in Argentina at the end of the month.\n\nBy then, they will have much to discuss.\n\nLike this morning's disclosure from NATO that the Russian military spent three weeks trying to disrupt a massive military exercise in Norway and Finland by jamming GPS signals.\n\nU.S. soldiers from the 2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion are pictured in a LAV-25 armored reconnaissance vehicle during Trident Juncture 2018, a NATO-led military exercise, on Oct. 30 in Norway. (Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTensions were already running high between the alliance and their Russian counterparts. There have been several too-close-for-comfort encounters in the skies over the Black Sea in recent weeks, including a near-collision with a U.S. Navy plane Nov. 5, and a late October incident where Canadian jets intercepted a Russian aircraft near Romanian airspace.\n\nThere are persistent rumours that Robert Mueller is about to drop a round of indictments connected to his probe of alleged collusion between the Kremlin and Trump's 2016 election campaign. The buzz is that they may target the president's son, Donald Jr., his gadfly advisor Roger Stone, or Jerome Corsi, a former Infowars writer who may or may not have had \"prior knowledge\" of hacked Hillary Clinton campaign emails.\n\nAlthough, as Mueller has already charged 26 Russian nationals and three companies in connection with his investigation and elicited only denials from the Kremlin, it doesn't seem likely that Putin is about to cop to any criminal wrongdoing. Even as the Russians have filed a defense in a civil suit brought by the Clinton campaign that characterizes any electoral interference that may possibly have happened as a \"military operation,\" and thereby shielded from foreign legal actions.\n\nThere are also issues of global concern, like the unravelling U.S.-Russia treaty on intermediate-range nuclear missiles. Trump has indicated he intends to pull out , and America plans to modernize its own nuclear arsenal with \"low yield\" bombs that make the Kremlin very uneasy.\n\nAll the while, the Cold War shows signs of rapid heating.\n\nA new report issued today by the U.S. National Defense Strategy Commission \u2014 a non-partisan panel of former national security officials \u2014 includes some dire warnings about how America might lose a major conflict with Russia or China.\n\nHelicopters fly above servicemen running to positions during the joint Russian-Belarusian military exercises Zapad-2017 (West-2017) at a training ground near the town of Borisov on Sept. 20, 2017.

(Associated Press)\n\nCannabis is present in your bloodstream for up to four weeks after consuming, but that doesn't mean you're impaired. The RCMP says there is no reliable test to detect impaired drivers, so imagine the difficulty employers are now facing.\n\nTake the police themselves, for instance. Their \"workplace\" involves the need for clear-headed, split-second decisions when officers are involved in whole range of situations, from high-speed driving to whether to use force. And the workplace policies on cannabis adopted by different forces vary widely:\n\nIn Calgary, cops can smoke cannabis 24 hours before going on duty.\n\nToronto's service says its officers can consume it, but not within 28 days of going on duty.\n\nOntario's provincial force is banning its members from ever smoking pot (an approach very likely to be challenged in court).\n\nIn a similar move to that of the Toronto police, Canada's two major airlines have ordered their pilots to stay away from cannabis for 28 days before flying. But how would they know if someone is breaking the rules, since there's no test to determine when a person last consumed?\n\nLike a lot of businesses, they're relying on others to speak up when something seems wrong.\n\nCannabis is present in your bloodstream for up to four weeks after consuming, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re impaired. (CBC)\n\nThis isn't just an issue for police and pilots. In many provinces, if a job is safety-sensitive (anything from working at heights to driving to sales calls), the employer needs to pull the employee off the job if they're impaired.\n\nMeanwhile, rights legislation in many places restricts an employer from firing someone for coming to work high \u2014 they often have a duty to direct the employee into rehab or counselling.\n\nMany employers are only now realizing this and they're playing catch-up after the green light provided by the government in October for recreational consumption of cannabis. They're rushing to find training on how to handle cannabis-related issues for both themselves and those who work for them.\n\nThen there are the interactions between workers and cannabis-smoking customers. Cabs in Calgary are already smoke-free, so riders shouldn't be hotboxing the taxi with a joint. But drivers are also concerned about being in an enclosed space with those who reek of cannabis. Could that make the driver impaired?\n\nThere are lots of questions, few solid answers \u2014 and lots of potential for problems as employers and employees try to figure all this out with recreational cannabis already being sold legally across Canada.\n\nWatch David Common's story from The National about the problems of pot in the workplace:\n\nIt's been almost one month since marijuana was legalized in Canada, but there are still a lot of questions about how people can consume it. 4:56\n\nA few words on ...\n\nA narrow escape from a deadly California fire.\n\nQuote of the moment\n\n\"Ultimately, the people have spoken.

Later that afternoon, the company also reported damage to a transmission tower near the town of Pulga, close to where the fire is believed to have begun some time that day.\n\nPulga resident Betsey Ann Cowley says the company contacted her in the days before the November 8 to request access to her property to repair transmission lines because \"they were having problems with sparks,\" she said the company told her in an email.\n\nThe so-called Camp Fire is on its way to being the most expensive in the history of the state. (Matthew Henderson)\n\nState records show the first reports of a fire in the area came at around 6:30 a.m. that morning. So far the fire has consumed 125,000 acres and is 30 per cent contained. Fire officials don't expect it to be fully under control until the end of the month at the earliest.\n\nPrior to the 8th, the company had also been warning customers that it may shut off gas and electricity services in the region as a precaution, because the risk of fire was so great. But the company elected not to go ahead with the shut down in Butte County and other areas, citing poor weather conditions.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit launched by Northern California Fire Lawyers in the San Francisco County Superior Court on Tuesday, the company is liable for the damage that ensued, which most recent estimates peg at more than $15 billion US.\n\n\"Despite its own recognition of these impending hazardous conditions, on the day of the Camp Fire's ignition, PG&E ultimately made the decision not to proceed with its plans for a power shutoff,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nPG&E says it doesn't have enough insurance to cover the costs. (Ken James/Bloomberg)\n\nButte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey told KRCR television on Wednesday that attributing the fire to PG&E at this point was \"speculative.\"\n\n\"It's important to remember that the cause (of the Camp Fire) has yet to be determined,\" PG&E said in a statement. \"Right now, our primary focus is on the communities, supporting first responders and getting our crews positioned and ready to respond when we get access, so that we can safely restore gas and electricity to our customers.\"\n\nThe company did warn investors on Tuesday, however, that it had tapped into a $3.3 billion credit facility to shore up cash, and added it is covered for up to about $1.4 billion in liability insurance.\n\nBut those figures combined could be nowhere near enough to cover the costs of the massive blaze if the company is found liable in any serious way.\n\n\"While the cause of the Camp Fire is still under investigation, if the utility's equipment is determined to be the cause, the utility could be subject to significant liability in excess of insurance coverage,\" the company said in the filing.\n\nBloomberg untility analyst Kit Konolige said the bill could be for more than the company is worth. \"Unless mitigated by regulators, we expect PG&E's write-offs could exceed the company's total equity,\" Konolige said.\n\nThat sent shares plunging. The company was trading at $48 a share the day before the fire started.

The province has set a $20 per credit floor price.\n\nFuel suppliers will receive for free about 80 per cent of what they will need.\n\nThe Ecology Action Centre on Wednesday welcomed some aspects of the plan, including putting money raised at credit auctions into a new Nova Scotia Green Fund that could generate between $25 million and $30 million a year for \"low-carbon programming.\"\n\nBut the Halifax-based group also criticized the province's emissions reduction targets from cap-and-trade, saying they aren't strong enough in the face climate change.\n\nSmaller market\n\nUnlike other jurisdictions, the credits generated in Nova Scotia can only be traded within the province, which is why the government is restricting how they can be exchanged and setting limits on how many can be traded. All told, the regulations published Wednesday run 47 pages.\n\nJason Hollett, the executive director of climate change with the Department of Environment, said those rules were needed because of Nova Scotia's unique system.\n\n\"It's important primarily because we understand that the market in Nova Scotia is a lot smaller than what you would see in other cap-and-trade markets,\" he said. \"So the limitations that are placed on purchasing and the regulations are meant to ensure that there are enough greenhouse-gas allowances for all participants in the province.\"\n\nCredits will decrease\n\nThe number of available credits will decrease by roughly one per cent over each of the four years of the program. Companies will be expected to lower their emissions year over year, but those that don't meet their targets will be expected to buy credits from those that do as compensation.\n\nThose trades happen through private transactions between program participants or confidentially through a Nova Scotia government auction. According to the regulations posted Wednesday, there will be a minimum of two auctions a year, starting in 2020.\n\nThe Nova Scotia government has previously said it expects consumers to pay about a penny more a litre for gasoline and heating oil, and about the same amount per cubic metre of natural gas. There's also a potential increase of about one percent on Nova Scotia Power bills starting next year.\n\nThere are no restrictions on credit trades between companies, but Nova Scotia Environment Minister Margaret Miller does have the power to limit trades, cancel deals and block companies from participating in auctions if he feels those companies are not playing by the rules or are trying to manipulate the price of credits.\n\nThe province has set a $20 per credit floor price, but has set aside a percentage of credits in a strategic reserve that can be made available, as a last resort, to companies that need credits but can't find a company willing or able to trade. Those credits will cost $50 each."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Reuters", "title": "U.S. defence secretary defends Mexico border deployment in first troop visit", "description": "U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis defended the deployment of thousands of troops to the border with Mexico as he traveled there on Wednesday, saying the mission was \"absolutely legal\" and justified, and that it was improving military readiness.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/mattis-border-mexico-troops-1.4905259", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4905309.1542220581!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/usa-immigration-mattis.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T19:03:27Z", "content": "U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis defended the deployment of thousands of troops to the border with Mexico as he traveled there on Wednesday, saying the mission was \"absolutely legal\" and justified, and that it was improving military readiness.

They have scoffed at Trump's comparison of caravans of Central American migrants, including women and children, to an \"invasion.\"\n\nMattis, speaking to a small group of reporters traveling with him, rejected criticism and said the deployment was the right thing to do.\n\n\"It's very clear that support to border police or border patrol is necessary right now,\" Mattis said, noting that that was the assessment of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nHe added the deployment was deemed legal by Trump administration attorneys and was improving readiness by giving troops more experience in rapid deployment.\n\n'Dynamic situation'\n\nThe visit took Mattis near the Texas town of Donna, where U.S. troops have set up a base camp near a border crossing point with Mexico. General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, the head of U.S. Northern Command, greeted him as he landed.\n\nMattis said U.S. soldiers were making rapid progress erecting barriers along the border and estimated the first, construction phase of the U.S. military effort could be completed within 10 days.\n\n\"I would anticipate with what we've been asked to do so far, probably within a week to 10 days, we'll have done what's needed,\" Mattis told the reporters. \"Of course, it will be a dynamic situation and there will be new requests coming in.\"\n\nMattis, alongside Nielsen, addresses troops at Base Camp Donna in Donna, Texas. (Phil Stewart/Reuters)\n\nMattis said the U.S. military was also rehearsing helicopter operations to help support U.S. border personnel, potentially flying them to new locations if the caravans of migrants shift direction.\n\nThe deployed U.S. troops are not expected to directly interact with migrants, most are unarmed, and they are only assigned tasks that support U.S. border personnel, including building temporary lodging.\n\nCongressional opposition\n\nTrump's Democratic opponents have threatened to investigate the matter once they take control of the House of Representatives early next year after gaining a majority in the House in the midterm elections.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Homeland Security, told Reuters that Trump had used the military \"as a prop to stoke fear and score political points.\"\n\n\"We will soon be finally able to conduct oversight of this gross abuse and the President's many failed border security policies,\" said Thompson, who is expected to lead the committee when the Democrats take control of the House.\n\nIt is unclear how long the deployment will last. Mattis initially authorized it through mid-December but it could be extended.\n\nMattis estimated about 5,900 troops were participating in the border mission. The U.S. military has offered a breakdown accounting for 5,600 of them, estimating about 2,800 troops in Texas, 1,500 in Arizona and another 1,300 in California.\n\nAsked whether troops' families should expect their loved ones to remain deployed through Thanksgiving or even Christmas, Mattis declined to speculate.\n\n\"We are a 365-day-a-year military. Rain or Shine. Light or dark. Cold weather or hot weather,\" he said, declining to estimate costs of the deployment until he had better data.\n\nMattis is briefed on the U.S. military's border deployment at Base Camp Donna, Texas. (Phil Stewart/Reuters)\n\nTrump railed against illegal immigration to win the 2016 presidential election and has shown no signs of easing up on the issue in the wake of last week's vote.\n\nLast week, he effectively suspended the granting of asylum to migrants who cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, seeking fresh ways to block thousands of Central Americans traveling in caravans from entering the United States.\n\nMattis compared the mission to other deployments in the past, largely comprised of U.S. National Guard, during Democratic and Republican administrations.\n\n\"We determined that the mission was absolutely legal and this was also reviewed by Department of Justice lawyers. It's obviously a moral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen,\" Mattis said.\n\n\"There's nothing new under the sun.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Sedins inducted into B.C.

Not even the people of Calgary.\n\nThe No side won with 56.4 per cent of the vote, a total of 304,774 people cast ballots across the city. 3:43\n\nThese are people who are reminded daily of the positive legacy of the 1988 Olympics in terms of facilities, international reputation, and a sporting culture which has undeniably enriched the lives of its many citizens for more than one generation.\n\nBut history, it seems, is just that, a thing of the past.\n\nRisks seemed to outweigh benefits\n\nWhat counted most in the majority of voters' minds, as this plebiscite demonstrated, was not the potential benefit of hosting the Olympics again, the Paralympics for the first time, or the community building that might result, but the risks associated with such an effort.\n\nThe bid was modest, responsible, and in keeping with a modern vision for the Olympics. The case was made that the Paralympic Winter Games were not hosted in Calgary in 1988 and that this was an opportunity to make the city more accessible and inclusive, and the envy of the world.\n\nThe bid committee planned to refurbish existing venues, utilize past experience in hosting the Games, build contingencies to protect against cost overruns, tighten security \u2014 and renew a strong legacy while stimulating a slumping economy.\n\nAnother Olympics and Paralympics, the advocates argued, would showcase Calgary on the global stage and help bring the city together.\n\nWarning signs in council\n\nInstead, the proposed bid divided the people. You could see it coming as late as Oct. 31 when city council almost abandoned the process. There was name calling and more than one accusation that creative accounting had been done to make the financial arrangements seem more palatable.\n\nOne councillor expressed a reservation to do business with the federal government. Some said they didn't understand the numbers on the ledger and that there were surely other, more pressing, priorities for the city budget.\n\nMore than a few of the politicians were wary of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and a perceived, recent tendency for corruption and irresponsibility when it comes to staging the Olympics.\n\nDoping scandals, greed, fiscal mismanagement and massive security concerns all got a thorough airing out as this debate plodded on. Outspoken Olympians and Paralympians came out to support the bid, but the backlash on social media was most disturbing. Some of these athletes were portrayed as an elite group of entitled, sports people looking to waste a bunch of money on a two-week party.\n\nThese are the same athletes who the city, province, and country eagerly celebrated at previous Olympic and Paralympic Games. They are the very same athletes who have gone on to become civic leaders and major contributors to the health of Calgary's communal narrative.\n\nIt is startling to see something decline in value. It's not as if Calgary is the only city to pass on hosting the modern Games by way of plebiscite. The German cities of Munich and Hamburg have done the same. Boston and Oslo pulled out of bids. Past hosts St. Moritz, Switzerland, and Innsbruck, Austria, have also said no recently.\n\nThe fact is, fewer and fewer cities are enamoured with the Olympics and by extension, the Paralympics.\n\nOpportunity lost, or mistake avoided?\n\nWhereas Canadians held their breath in anticipation of Vancouver being chosen to host the 2010 Games, the majority of people in Calgary, the city that pulled off one of the most successful Winter Games ever, turned their noses up at the prospect of another and more complete chance.\n\nIt's no one's fault and there are no villains here on the yes or the no side. Many will say it's an opportunity lost. Others are firm in their belief that it's a mistake avoided.\n\nThe real loser here is the Olympic movement itself.\n\nThere is little doubt that had Calgary gone ahead with its ambition to bid for the 2026 Games, it would have become the frontrunner to win the competition. Surviving bids from Cortina/Milan, Italy and Stockholm, Sweden have no government funding and few of the infrastructure advantages that Calgary's now abandoned bid had.\n\nAll of which means those who run the Olympics have to take a long, hard, look at themselves and what they're doing to their brand. It's very revealing that they are now held in such low esteem that they desperately wanted Calgary, but as it turns out Calgary didn't want them.\n\nQuestions will immediately surround Calgary's existing legacy. What becomes of the facilities?\n\nWill they be renewed and refurbished? More importantly, what happens to the intangible and infectious Olympic spirit which has characterized the place for the last 30 years?\n\nCalgary is identified as an Olympic city \u2014 it always will be. It is without question one of the landmark hosts in Winter Games history.\n\nThat said, the past is all too often, easy to forget. This result which says no to another Games means the people of Calgary are sending the people in charge of the Olympics a very clear message: Wake up and look to a better future in a hurry."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Tuberculosis screening expanded following Nain outbreak", "description": "With more than two dozen cases of TB in Nain, screening efforts for the disease are being expended to prevent further spread.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/nain-tb-screening-expanded-1.4904809", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3585529.1518545939!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/lung-x-ray.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T18:42:43Z", "content": "Health officials in Nain say screening efforts for tuberculosis are being expanded to prevent further spread of the disease, after dozens of cases have been reported.

The next step is to find anyone else who may have come in contact with the disease, and she said about 600 people have been screened since March \u2014 nearly half the population of Nain.\n\nAbout 500 more people will likely be screened when testing is expanded, she said.\n\n\"We are now at a point where we're very confident that we have done a thorough review of that contact investigation and we're now at a point where we can look at expanding our screening efforts to broaden up to provide all residents of Nain with an opportunity to come in and be screened for tuberculosis,\" said Doody.\n\n'Sleeping' infection can cause outbreaks\n\nProper screening is important, Doody said, because the TB infection can lie dormant in otherwise healthy people for many years. A high burden of latent infection in a community can lead to outbreaks, as people age and their immune systems become more vulnerable to the \"sleeping\" disease.\n\n\"TB is spread, as you know, through the air, so when someone coughs, if they have active disease in their lungs, they cough and the bugs go into the air, so someone can easily breath in those germs,\" Doody said.\n\n\"And then sometimes those germs, depending on the person's immune system, they may go on to develop active disease, or they may stay in their lungs and their body walls off the infection and they lie dormant or sleeping.\"\n\nGussie Bennett, 14, of Nain died of tuberculosis.

He has also worked to forge peace with Eritrea.

Gorilla Doctors, a nongovernmental group, has trained veterinary staff in each of the countries where the mountain gorillas live.\n\nHunting in the national parks is illegal, but nearby residents still set traps to catch other animals, such as antelopes. Those traps can also grab gorillas' arms and legs.\n\nWhen gorillas are found struggling with snares, the vets are called in to clean wounds.

Out of 767,734 eligible voters, 304,774 voted and 171,750 said No.\n\nCoun. Druh Farrell, who was on the No side, said people are craving a vision for their city \u2014 but clearly not one that included an Olympic bid.\n\n\"We should take that and run with it and work with Calgarians on what Calgary looks like in the future,\" she said.\n\nThe results won't be declared official until Friday, with council expected to address the results Monday. City council has the final say on whether Calgary proceeds with a bid.\n\nCalgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi said he believes the 2026 Olympic dream is indeed dead, and he would not support moving ahead with the bid against the public's wishes.\n\nCalgary had received promises of financial support from the federal and provincial governments, the latter of which was tied to a Yes vote.\n\nAlberta Culture and Tourism Minister Ricardo Miranda says the provincial government respects the decision of Calgarians.\n\nSpeaking Wednesday in Calgary, Miranda thanked the government, public and private individuals who worked on the Yes and No campaigns, as well as those who hammered out a proposal and got information to the public 30 days before this week's vote.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Alberta government had made its funding of a bid conditional on a plebiscite and provided $2 million to pay for it. Miranda confirmed the promised $700 million in funding for an Olympic Games would be withheld following the No vote.\n\nHe also tried to calm fears that public funding for the Games would have jeopardized other public projects.\n\n\"One of the things we were really clear about when we made our $700-million commitment was that we will not sacrifice any other projects that were already approved or were potentially being approved,\" Miranda told reporters at the press conference. \"The $700 million was not going to affect those different projects that would be beneficial to the city and the province itself.\"\n\nMiranda called the vote \"a success\" because Calgarians had an opportunity to have their say, which he said was not an easy decision to make.\n\n\"While this may not be the time to pursue an Olympic bid, there will be other opportunities in the future, and when the time is right and those opportunities come, I am confident our community will embrace them,\" Miranda said.\n\nWatch the video below to hear the minister's full comments.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee said that it would continue to work with Milan/Cortina d'Ampezzo and Stockholm in a search for a host city following Calgary's rejection of submitting a bid.\n\n\"It comes as no surprise following the political discussions and uncertainties right up until the last few days,\" a spokesperson for the IOC said in a statement.\n\n\"It is disappointing that the arguments about the sporting, social and long-term benefits of hosting the Olympic Games did not sway the vote,\" the statement added.\n\nFunding questions and changing opinions of councillors likely swayed some people to opposing the bid, political scientist Lori Williams said. The chair of the city's Olympic bid assessment committee, Coun. Evan Woolley, for example, questioned who would cover budget shortfalls earlier this month.\n\n\"That I think had to carry an awful lot of weight in the minds of some people where they just said, 'Look, a lot of uncertainties here, this could cost a lot, we know Ottawa's not going to cover the shortfall,'\" Williams said. \"People just said, 'We don't know enough. We're being asked to commit too much without enough information.'\"\n\nShe said some have suggested the IOC offering to cover those shortfalls, in particular for security costs, from Games revenues may have helped the cause.\n\nHopes for future Canadian Olympics\n\nGripped by disappointment, Canadian Olympic Committee president Tricia Smith remained hopeful that the country will still host the Games in the future.\n\n\"Sport in a positive sense really brings a country together,\" Smith said Wednesday morning. \"I think it's just a part of us, our humanity. So I suspect we will see another bid from Canada.\"\n\nSmith took a red-eye flight back to Toronto after trying to drum up support in Calgary on Tuesday. However, a majority of voters said No to a potential Calgary bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics and Paralympic Games, with 56.4 per cent of those who went to the polls casting a dissenting vote.\n\n\"This was an opportunity for Calgary to really sort of lead the way and show how it could be done, but we have to respect the process and respect the result of the vote,\" Smith told The Canadian Press.\n\nMembers of the \"Yes\" campaign react to the results of a plebiscite on whether the city of Calgary should proceed with a bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics, which was a resounding \"No\". (Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press)\n\nThe group representing Canada's Paralympic athletes also said it was disappointed but respected the decision.\n\nMarc-Andre Fabien, president of the Canadian Paralympic Committee, said a home Games would have \"united the nation\" and energized people across the country. In a statement, he said he's pleased \"the people of Calgary had the opportunity to share their voice.\"\n\nIn Calgary, former Olympic hockey coach and longtime athletics leader Dale Henwood said the city should still try to maintain its position as a premiere winter sport training venue without the promised Olympic cash.\n\n\"Very much disappointed, and I think it's a lost opportunity for us,\" Henwood told Radio-Canada. \"But we now have to look at where we in sport want to go the next six or seven years. We won't be able to do it based on a home Games so we're going to have to find some other ways.\"\n\nOther groups are also upset at the lost funding, like the Town of Canmore, which would have received hundreds of affordable housing units through the construction of an athletes village.\n\nNew bid?\n\nAnother Games bid, however, may not be the solution. The chair of Calgary's bid corporation doesn't think Calgary should immediately shift its focus to chasing the 2030 Winter Games.\n\nScott Hutcheson says the city needs to decompress and re-assess.\n\n\"I don't think it's 2030,\" Hutcheson said. \"I think you've got to put your pencil down for seven years. You don't put it down for three years.\n\n\"Use the work later, but you can't put a city through this every four years. My view would be let it go, accept the result, move on and come back with a bid maybe in seven years.\"\n\nBuilding Calgary\n\nThe vice-president of Calgary Economic Development says he hopes the agency can build on the remaining enthusiasm to further its vision for the city, which involved building up key sectors of the economy, from food to energy.\n\n\"It's really quite exciting over the last few months the number of people that have come together to say, 'I'm behind this. I'm willing to help and these are the things that I can do,'\" Court Ellingson said.\n\nLikewise, Tourism Calgary has turned its attention to forging the city's future, although spokesperson Cindy Ady declined to specify the projects getting underway.\n\nTourism Calgary was involved with the Yes campaign, which Ady said was completely privately funded.\n\n\"We're going to pick our tools back up and go to work on some things that we think are exciting and we think will add a lot of value to Calgary,\" she said.\n\nThe IOC will accept bids in early January and the election of the host city is set to be finalized in June.\n\nPyeongchang, South Korea, served as host of the 2018 Winter Games.

The most recent situation she's heard about was from 2017.\n\nShe said she's heard from at least two women reporting incidents in Manitoba.\n\n\"There may be more reporting that they were sterilized without proper and informed consent, against their will, in Winnipeg.\"\n\nThe most recent Manitoba incident happened in 2009, she said.\n\nThe women in Manitoba were all from Indigenous communities outside Winnipeg, Lombard said.\n\nThe women allege they were coerced into tubal ligations \u2014 the severing, burning or tying of the Fallopian tubes that carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus \u2014 during or after childbirth, or while seeking reproductive health services.\n\nIn many cases, the women were in labour, about to go under anesthetic for a caesarean section or already under anesthesia, Lombard said.

A federal investigation was done in the 1970s, she added, and the subject made headlines again starting in 2015.\n\nOn Monday, Ontario Sen. Yvonne Boyer said she'd like the Senate to do a national study of the issue.\n\n\"If it's happened in Saskatoon, it has happened in Regina, it's happened in Winnipeg, it's happened where there's a high population of Indigenous women,\" Boyer told the Canadian Press. \"I've had many women contact me from across the country and ask me for help.\"\n\nIn the proposed class-action suit in Saskatchewan, each woman is seeking $7 million in damages.\n\nLombard said the suit is also seeking specific legislative changes to end the practice and address the \"utter absence\" of preventative measures, including the criminalization of forced sterilization. Without that, the practice is punted into civil law, Lombard said, although some courts have held it constitutes sexual battery.\n\n\"We want to stop this from happening.

Casey spent the last seven seasons as Toronto's bench boss, but was fired this past May after the Raptors were swept by the Cleveland Cavaliers for the second consecutive year.\n\nIn honour of Casey's return, here's a look back at the five most memorable homecomings in Raptors' franchise history.\n\nThe Good\n\nJose Calderon\n\nThe 6-foot-3 Spaniard recorded a franchise-record 3,770 assists over seven and a half years in Toronto. During the 2008-2009 season, Calderon shot 98.1 per cent from the free-throw line, setting a single season NBA record.\n\nThe point guard was traded to the Detroit Pistons in January 2013 in a three team deal that sent Rudy Gay to Toronto. Calderon was well-liked by Raptors fans, and received a standing ovation during his first game back in Toronto later that same season.\n\nAt halftime, Calderon started walking toward the locker room. The only problem was that it was the wrong locker room.\n\nCalderon finished the game with 19 points on 8-of-12 shooting as the Pistons beat the Raptors 108-98.\n\nMorris Peterson\n\nMo Pete, as he was affectionately known by Raptors fans, spent his first seven seasons in Toronto, playing in 371 consecutive games between 2002 and 2006.\n\nHe'll always be remembered in Toronto for an incredible game-tying three-pointer against the Washington Wizards in 2007.\n\nIn July 2007, Peterson agreed to a four-year, $23 million US contract with the New Orleans Hornets.\n\nThe Flint, Mich., native was cheered by fans in his return to Toronto on Mar. 30, 2008. Mo Pete even kissed the Air Canada Centre floor when he was introduced as part of the Hornets starting lineup.\n\nPeterson scored eight points in 24 minutes, including a pair of three-pointers as the Hornets beat the Raptors 118-111.\n\nThe Bad\n\nAntonio Davis\n\nAntonio Davis was acquired by Toronto in 1999, and played a major role in the Raptors' playoff runs between 2000 and 2002.\n\nThe Oakland, Calif., native drew the wrath of Raptors fans after a 2001 interview with Jim Rome, when he expressed concern about the type of education his children would receive in Canada. He even said he was worried about his kids learning the metric system.\n\nDavis was traded to the Chicago Bulls in December 2003. He played his first game back in Toronto in March 2004 and was loudly booed every time he touched the ball. Despite the crowd's reaction, Davis played well, scoring 18 points and collecting 14 rebounds as the Bulls beat the Raptors 96-91.\n\nChris Bosh\n\nChris Bosh was a five-time All Star (2006-2010) during his seven-year tenure in Toronto.\n\nBut all that starts well doesn't always end well.\n\nBosh suffered a facial fracture toward the end of the 2010 season with the Raptors battling for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. As a result, he missed the final five games of the year, and the Raptors finished the season a game back of the Chicago Bulls for the eighth seed.\n\nBosh joined the Miami Heat that summer in a sign-and-trade agreement. After his departure, Raptors general manager Bryan Colangelo said that Bosh had 'checked out' the previous season. Bosh responded that he'd put his \"heart and soul\" into the Raptors organization.\n\nIn his first game back in Toronto in February 2011, Raptors fans booed Bosh every time he touched the ball, as well as when the camera panned over his face during the national anthem.\n\nBosh scored 25 points on 7-for-16 shooting, going 11-for-12 from the free throw line. The Heat defeated the Raptors 103-95.\n\nFollowing the game, Bosh blew kisses to the crowd as he walked off the floor. When asked if this was a sarcastic gesture, he responded, 'What does sarcasm mean?'\n\nThe Ugly\n\nVince Carter\n\nDuring their first three years in existence, the Toronto Raptors sported a miserable record of 67-179. Then, in the summer of 1998, the Raptors acquired Vince Carter in a draft-day trade.\n\nThe Florida native immediately made the Raptors a formidable opponent. Carter won the Rookie of the Year award in 1999, and led the Raptors to their first playoff series victory against the New York Knicks in 2001.\n\nBut the relationship between Carter and the team soured over the next few years.\n\nIn the summer of 2004, Carter publicly requested a trade. In December 2004, he was dealt to the New Jersey Nets.\n\nMany fans believed that Carter didn't put forth his best effort during his final season in Toronto.\n\nThe numbers seemed to corroborate that assertion.\n\nIn 20 games with the Raptors to begin the 2004-2005 campaign, Carter averaged 15.9 points a game while shooting 41.1 per cent from the floor, and 32.2 per cent from three-point range. In 57 games with the Nets that season, Carter averaged 27.5 points a game, while shooting 46 per cent from the floor, and 42.5 per cent from beyond the arc.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, a report surfaced that he'd told the Seattle Supersonics a play the Raptors were about to run while he was still a member of the team.\n\nIn April 2005, Carter made his long awaited return to Toronto. It wasn't pretty.\n\nRaptors fans booed Carter mercilessly, heckling him during warm-ups, the national anthem, the lineup introduction, and every time he touched the ball. Additional security guards were placed by the Nets bench in order to protect Carter.\n\nDespite the chaos around him, Carter dominated, scoring 39 points on 15-for-26 shooting as the Nets beat Toronto 101-90.\n\nOver the next few years, the North Carolina alumnus was loudly heckled every time he returned to Toronto. The hostility directed toward Carter reached its apex in during a 2007 first round playoff series between the Raptors and Nets.\n\nIn 2014, Raptors fans finally showed their appreciation for Carter, cheering him as he received a tribute video as part of the team's 20-year anniversary celebrations. The tribute clearly struck a chord with Carter, as he could be seen tearing up while watching the tribute.\n\nWatch Vince Carter's emotional reaction to his tribute video"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Cracks force partial closure of bridge over Red River in Winnipeg", "description": "The Manitoba government has closed down part of a bridge in south Winnipeg after cracks showed up in the deck concrete.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/cracks-bridge-red-river-inspection-winnipeg-1.4904709", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4904783.1542210570!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/red-river-bridge.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T15:44:00Z", "content": "The Manitoba government has closed down part of a bridge in south Winnipeg after cracks showed up in the deck concrete.

According to Manconi, Rideau Transit Group (RTG), the consortium building the east-west Confederation Line, has met some key milestones:\n\nOn Tuesday, six trains made 55 successful end-to-end trips along the 12.5-kilometre route, from Blair to Tunney's stations.\n\nStations east of downtown \u2014 uOttawa, Lees, Hurdman, Tremblay, St. Laurent, Cyrville and Blair \u2014 are essentially complete.\n\nTrains have been able to run at their maximum 83 km/h, although they won't operate at that speed.\n\nFare gates and vending machines have been installed.\n\nAs well, RTG is going to launch a \"practice plan\" later this month \u2014 essentially, running the system with a full fleet.\n\nRTG is not contractually obligated to run the practice plan, which would be added to the 12-day testing period that is part of the contract.\n\nMayor still 'confident'\n\nMayor Jim Watson told reporters that he had \"great confidence\" that the LRT would be up and running by the end of the first quarter of 2019.\n\n\"When we finally saw the train run from one end to the other, with the right speeds and the right times for loading and unloading people, it tells me we're coming very very close to having full service by the 31st of March, 2019,\" said Watson, who tweeted a video of a test run.\n\nAll aboard Ottawa's LRT train!

It's unclear whether that lost revenue can be recouped from RTG, which is in theory responsible for any delay-related costs.\n\nBut Manconi said that while the city may go after RTG for certain costs, there's no guarantee the consortium will agree to the city's demands.

It's yet to be established, according to the report, that \"the video surveillance program is in compliance with FOIPOP.\"\n\nBacklogs still mean it takes an average of more than 400 days to resolve reviews, and in the last year acceptance, both full and partial, of the recommendations of those reviews fell from 81 per cent to 67 per cent.\n\n\"The fact that public bodies and municipalities are not required to comply with recommendations is a significant weakness in our access law,\" the report says. \"Currently the burden is on the public to bear the costs of litigation to appeal a public body's decision not to comply with a recommendation.\"\n\nLaws no longer up to task\n\nThe report notes the growing collection of databases that include personal information and the \"urgent need to strengthen and clarify the responsibilities for and monitoring of interoperable health information databases to protect the privacy of Nova Scotians' health information.\"\n\nNova Scotia's privacy standards fall well short of the new standards set by the European Union's general data protection regulation, which Tully predicts will become the standard expected, particularly when it comes to doing business with the EU.\n\n\"Nova Scotians deserve modern access and privacy protections including effective oversight of their rights. Our current laws are no longer up to the task.\"\n\nAs she and her predecessors have done in the past, Tully again calls for order-making power, an idea Premier Stephen McNeil has steadfastly rejected since coming to office in 2013.\n\nTully says order-making power would motivate public bodies to more actively participate in informal resolutions, an approach she introduced that's proved particularly successful in resolving matters.\n\n\"Informal resolution decreases the time to resolve complaints and, of course, improves the resolution of matters to the satisfaction of both parties.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Ottawa sees 1st flu-related death of season", "description": "This winter's flu season, which got underway earlier than normal across Canada, has claimed its first victim in Ottawa.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/flu-season-ottawa-death-1.4904668", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4840013.1537998699!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/on-the-money-flu-shots.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T15:10:05Z", "content": "This winter's flu season, which got underway earlier than normal across Canada, has claimed its first victim in Ottawa.

The forward had been tearing up the American Hockey League with the Belleville Senators, scoring 20 points in just 14 games this season, including a recent six-point game.\n\nOttawa coach Guy Boucher said Batherson will play right wing next to star centre Matt Duchene on the Senators's top line.\n\n\"There are guys who try to tear the door down with their play and he's one of those guys,\" Boucher said following a team practice. \"He's not just knocking at the door. I mean, after his six-point night he was the top scorer in the American League.\"\n\nBatherson is shown when he was 12 years old and a member of the Antigonish Bulldogs peewee AAA team. (Submitted by Batherson family)\n\nBatherson's father, Norm, was a professional player in the minor leagues and was also signed by the Ottawa Senators, but the North Sydney native never played in the NHL.\n\nHe'll be one of several Batherson family members in the stands to watch Drake make his NHL debut. Drake's parents got the good news of his call-up on Monday when their son called home.\n\n\"I knew he had just finished up his practice with Belleville so I said to him, 'What's up?'\" Norm said in an interview Wednesday. \"He said, 'Dad, I'm going up.' After that we were both pretty pumped. He was so excited, as were we.\"\n\nDrake was born in Indiana in 1998 when Norm was playing with the Fort Wayne Komets. When he was very young his family packed up for Germany where his father played pro for seven years.\n\nThey returned to Nova Scotia and eventually settled in New Minas near Acadia University, where Norm was a college star and won a national championship with the Axemen.\n\nBatherson was with the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles in 2017 when he signed a contract with the Ottawa Senators. (Mike Sullivan)\n\nBatherson hit a big growth spurt at the age of 16 and that's when his game really took off. He developed into a top prospect playing in front of many relatives in Sydney with the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles.\n\nAmong his loyal fans is his grandfather, Matt Batherson, a former senior hockey star with the Northside Victorias and Sydney Millionaires. Drake's great uncle, musician Matt Minglewood, also attended many of his Screaming Eagles games.\n\n\"When I look back at where I've come from and all the people who have supported me along the way my whole life, I plan to make the most of this chance for sure,\" said Batherson, the newest Nova Scotian to crack the National Hockey League.\n\nAll Canadian hockey fans became aware of Batherson at last year's IIHF World Junior Championship when he scored a team high seven goals in leading Team Canada to gold.\n\nOn Saturday night, Ottawa will host Sidney Crosby and the Pittsburgh Penguins. Growing up in Nova Scotia, Crosby was Batherson's idol."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Christopher Reynolds", "title": "Bombardier CEO defends layoffs, insists they are necessary", "description": "The comments were the first Alain Bellemare has made about the layoffs \u2014 or potential cuts ahead \u2014 since the multinational company announced major restructuring in its aerospace division last Thursday.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/bombardier-alain-bellemare-layoffs-1.4904580", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4904586.1542200746!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bombardier-quebec-minister-20181112.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T14:20:23Z", "content": "The head of Bombardier Inc. is defending his move to lay off 5,000 workers 3,000 of them in Canada citing efficiency while leaving the door open to more job cuts down the line. \"Yes, it is tough.

The ongoing crisis affecting the Rohingya in Myanmar also came up, according to the release.\n\nA joint statement on marine litter called for a reduction in single-use plastics, a reduction in microbeads in beauty products, and more work on recycling and other efforts to keep plastics out of oceans.\n\nTrudeau also thanked Chinese officials for helping Canadian police fight drug trafficking, including the illegal sale of opioids.\n\nTalks in Beijing laid groundwork\n\nThis was the third \"leaders' dialogue\" between Trudeau and Li.\n\nLast weekend, two of Trudeau's ministers \u2014 Finance Minister Bill Morneau, and International Trade Diversification Minister Jim Carr \u2014 were in Beijing for talks that set the table for the broad range of agreements revealed Wednesday.\n\nTrudeau's trip to Singapore for talks on the margins of the ASEAN summit has resembled more of a trade mission, with an itinerary full of opportunities to meet businesspeople and market Canada's economy abroad.\n\nHe delivered a keynote speech in Canada's pavilion at the Singapore FinTech Festival on Wednesday, helping to promote the 20 companies from three provinces that participated.\n\nTrudeau stopped by the Singapore Fintech Festival on Wednesday to give a speech promoting Canada's tech sector, telling a packed room of about 400 attendees that 'we get the way the world is going.'

It's not a day. It's a continuum of conversations,\" Carr told reporters after Trudeau concluded his meeting with Li.\n\nCarr also said the two leaders talked about Canada's work to lead a conversation about reforming the World Trade Organization.\n\nChina's a relatively new member, and its membership remains controversial.\n\nTwo years ago, the WTO began treating China like a free market economy for things like calculating prices in dumping disputes. Both the U.S. and the European Union believe that's not fair, because China's state-owned companies enjoy advantages that private companies in a true market economy would not have.\n\nChina believes it is playing by the rules laid out when it became a member in 2001, and it has complied with WTO decisions that have not gone its way in the years since.\n\nThe U.S., now unhappy with the WTO for a host of reasons, has blocked the appointment of new judges to the WTO's appellate body, undermining its ability to arbitrate trade disputes.\n\nCanada hosted a meeting of 13 \"like-minded\" countries in Ottawa on Oct. 25 to begin work on changes that could eventually be endorsed by all 164 WTO members.\n\nBut China and the U.S., the two principal combatants in an escalating protectionist trade war that's disrupting supply chains around the world, are not included, at least to start.\n\nImprovements to the WTO would be \"warmly welcomed\" by the Chinese, Carr said. Rather than feeling excluded, Canada's approach of starting with the small group of countries and then branching out garnered \"considerable support\" from Premier Li.\n\nASEAN negotiations within months?\n\nSingapore's prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, also met privately with Trudeau on the margins of the ASEAN summit.\n\nRepresentatives of the two countries exchanged memoranda of understanding on cybersecurity co-operation, and infrastructure and \"smart cities.\"\n\nBecause Canada isn't a member of ASEAN, Trudeau was only invited to two events on the official summit calendar Wednesday.\n\nReporters were not allowed to attend or film the prime minister's remarks at a noon-hour luncheon with the leaders of the 10-country regional trading bloc. But officials shared an audio recording with media travelling with the prime minister this week, to facilitate reporting.\n\nTrudeau met his Singapore counterpart, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, later Wednesday afternoon. The two countries signed agreements on cybersecurity co-operation and urban infrastructure. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)\n\nTrudeau said he hoped Canada would be able to \"move forward\" with plans for a Canada\u2013ASEAN free trade agreement. Exploratory discussions have been underway, but the prime minister suggested those could wrap up by next spring \"so we can move forward to negotiation phase.\"\n\nHe also made a pitch for ASEAN support of Canada's bid to win a seat on the United Nations Security Council for 2021.\n\nIn the evening, Trudeau attended a gala for not only ASEAN members, but also the additional countries that participate in the East Asia Summit, which typically coincides with ASEAN.\n\nThe East Asia Summit \u2014 which includes ASEAN countries plus the U.S. (represented here by Vice-President Mike Pence), Russia (President Vladimir Putin attended meetings earlier), China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand \u2014 is becoming an increasingly important forum for the discussion of regional security issues, such as North Korea's nuclear weapons program.\n\nCanada has been lobbying to join the East Asia Summit.

(Khalil Hamra/Associated Press)\n\nThe two sides had appeared to be on the verge of their fourth war in a decade. Instead, Gaza's Hamas rulers abruptly announced a ceasefire and Israel's Security Cabinet ended a seven-hour discussion with an apparent decision to hold its fire.\n\nThe news was greeted with celebrations in Gaza, with Hamas declaring victory in the latest round of violence, which was triggered by a botched Israeli raid on Sunday that left seven Palestinian militants and a senior Israeli military officer dead.\n\nRecurring border protests\n\nHamas has staged near-weekly border protests since March in an effort to lift the Israeli-Egyptian blockade imposed after the Islamic militant group seized control of the coastal strip in 2007. The blockade has ravaged Gaza's economy, and Israel refuses to lift it unless Hamas disarms, a demand rejected by the militant group, which is pledged to Israel's destruction.\n\nDemonstrators each week have approach the border fence, throwing firebombs, grenades and burning tires at Israeli troops. The Associated Press says Israeli snipers have killed about 170 people, most of them unarmed. Reuters says Israeli troops have killed around 220 Palestinians.\n\nIsrael says it is defending its border against attackers, but it has come under heavy international criticism for shooting unarmed people.\n\nBefore Sunday's raid, Egyptian and UN mediators had made progress in reducing tensions. In recent days, Israel had allowed fuel shipments to increase the power supply in Gaza, which suffers from frequent blackouts, and agreed to additional Qatari assistance to allow Hamas to pay the salaries of its thousands of government workers.\n\nThe standoff has produced repeated rounds of violence in recent years, including indiscriminate Gaza rocket fire at Israeli towns and cities and punishing Israeli military offensives, but Hamas remains firmly in control.\n\n\"We are third-class citizens here in Sderot and the communities on the border with Gaza,\" complained David Maimon, a local resident. \"It's a shame.

The official result will be made available at 3 p.m. MT on Friday, with results by riding posted Thursday at noon.\n\nAfter asking voters for guidance, Calgary's council will likely formally halt the city's bidding process at a meeting on Monday.\n\nThe No side won with 56.4 per cent of the vote, a total of 304,774 people cast ballots across the city. 3:43\n\nWhen Calgary initially announced plans to pursue the 2026 Winter Olympics, it all seemed so perfect. Calgary would recapture the Olympic spirit and excitement that enveloped and boosted the city when it hosted the 1988 Winter Games.\n\nBut for many, this bid never felt like 1988. Whatever the magical feeling was 30 years ago, it never captured voters. And now, Calgary's nascent Olympic bid has finally lurched to an unceremonious end.\n\nSo, what happened?\n\nThose behind Calgary 2026 did a lot of things right. They engaged and mobilized a cross-section of supportive voices. They attempted to showcase the Games as opportunity to revitalize and refurbish the physical legacy of 1988. Organizers also pointed to a successful bid as a needed economic lifeline for a city whose economy has been crippled by falling oil prices.\n\nWrong event at the wrong time\n\nBut as this process evolved, so too did an opposition that grew more mobilized and vocal as decision day approached. With far less money at their disposal than the professional bid committee, a web of critics appear to have effectively delivered their message that this was the wrong event at the wrong time for Calgary.\n\nAnd from an outside perspective, beyond the boosterism of those connected to the Olympic movement, there never seemed to be an overwhelming amount of genuine excitement among everyday Calgarians.\n\nPerhaps that could have been overcome. Most of the concerns surrounding this bid centred on who would pay for the Games. But voters either didn't like or couldn't understand the numbers they were given. Even on the floor of Calgary city council, leading up to this vote, there was confusion about exactly how much each level of government would provide.\n\nVoters were promised this information before being asked to decide whether they wanted an Olympics.\n\n\"What is the number we can take to the citizens of the city of Calgary?\" Coun. Jeremy Farkas asked.\n\nJudging by the results, the 11th-hour funding agreement by the city, the Alberta government and Ottawa, weeks before this vote, provided Calgarians little clarity or confidence.\n\nPast Olympic failures loomed large\n\nThis bid also undeniably fell victim to the unpleasant baggage weighing down the Olympic movement. The cynical narrative is familiar by now. Cities spend billions more than initially proposed to host a two-week party that leaves little long-term positive economic impact.\n\nRobert Livingstone operates the website GamesBids.com and has followed this process closely. He says people are increasingly wise about past Olympic failures.\n\n\"It's so ingrained and people perceive that the Olympic culture is corrupt, often real corruption in some cases. They have seen this big build and the overspend.\"\n\nLivingstone points out the International Olympic Committee has taken steps to mitigate this perception among Calgary voters.\n\nIn the past, the IOC has rarely interacted or visited with potential host cities. But with fewer cities lining up to host the Olympics, the IOC has resorted to actively selling the Games. Its representatives visited Calgary numerous times in recent months, attending town halls and doing rounds of media interviews.\n\nLivingstone also says the IOC, as part of its Agenda 2020, has taken steps to make the Games easier to bid on and cheaper to host. For example, in past Games, the IOC usually insisted on new buildings, often with little long-term practical use for host cities. But Calgary's bid focused on the IOC-supported idea of mostly refurbishing old facilities instead of building new ones.\n\nAgenda 2020 never resonated in Calgary\n\nThe lean bid model may work to counter the Olympic bid narrative, Livingstone says, but it may have actually made a potential bid less attractive for Calgary voters.\n\n\"I think Agenda 2020 is a total disconnect in Calgary,\" Livingstone says. \"Agenda 2020 didn't make sense because in Calgary, they want the venues. They wouldn't stop talking about the NHL arena and how they were going to get at it and the rail link to the airport. But because of Agenda 2020, it was left off [and] not included.\"\n\nSo what now for the 2026 Winter Olympics \u2014 the Games that nobody seems to want?\n\nWhen this process began, there were eight hopeful cities. Only two remain: Stockholm, and a joint Italian bid. And both of those bids face significant internal political hurdles.\n\nLivingstone thinks there could be another host lurking in the background.\n\n\"I really think that the IOC is hoping that Stockholm and Italy just go away and then they can work with Salt Lake City.\"\n\nThe American city, like Calgary, also has an Olympic legacy, having hosted the Games in 2002. Livingstone says the difference in Utah is a genuine enthusiasm to do it again.\n\n\"As they say themselves, they can get this done tomorrow [with] 89 per cent public support. They have the Utah governor already signing off on it. They did a feasibility study, and literally they could host the Games next year.\"\n\nFor many in Calgary, it seems that's just fine.\n\nCalgary, along with the rest of the country, will undoubtedly enjoy the 2026 Winter Olympics wherever they eventually land.\n\nWe will continue to celebrate medals and Canadian achievement, content to let somebody else foot the bill."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "2 teens arrested in death of 17-year-old from Nuns' Island", "description": "Montreal police have arrested two teens, a boy and a girl, in connection with the death of a 17-year-old, whose body was found in a wooded area on Nuns' Island earlier this week.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/2-teens-arrested-nuns-island-teen-death-1.4904590", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4904604.1542200688!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/nuns-island-death-17-year-old.jpeg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T13:15:54Z", "content": "Montreal police have arrested two teens, a boy and a girl, in connection with the death of a 17-year-old, whose body was found in a wooded area on Nuns' Island earlier this week.

The transition period can be extended by joint agreement before July 1, 2020 if both parties decide more time is needed.\n\nCitizens' Rights: EU citizens living in Britain, and Britons elsewhere in the bloc, will continue to have the rights to live and work that they do now.\n\nA political declaration: Stating that Britain and the EU will seek a \"free trade area combining deep regulatory and customs cooperation,\" and \"ambitious, comprehensive and balanced\" arrangements for the services sector. It aims to include: visa-free travel for short-term visits, smooth rail road, air and sea transport and \"comprehensive, close, balanced and reciprocal law enforcement and judicial cooperation.\"\n\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called the deal bad for Scotland's economy. (Stefan Rousseau/Pool via reuters)\n\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Wednesday that the deal was bad for the Scottish economy, adding that parliamentary approval would be difficult to win.\n\n\"It is obvious that [May] can barely unite her cabinet on this deal, and it is also increasingly clear that she will struggle to get a majority for it in Parliament,\" she said in an emailed statement.\n\n\"If this deal is indeed rejected by Parliament, then the U.K. government must return to the negotiating table to secure a better one.\"\n\nMay told lawmakers in weekly question period earlier in the day that the deal means Britain will \"take back control\" of its laws and borders \"while protecting jobs, security and the integrity of our United Kingdom.\"\n\n\"The cabinet will decide on the next steps in the national interest. I'm confident that this takes us significantly closer to delivering what the British people voted for in the referendum,\" May told Parliament.\n\n'A decisive step'\n\nThe ultimate outcome for the United Kingdom remains uncertain: scenarios range from a calm divorce to rejection of May's deal, potentially sinking her premiership and leaving the bloc with no agreement, or another referendum.\n\nThe hours-long meeting led to heightened speculation in the British media, including the possibility of a ministerial resignation or even a leadership challenge to May, which would require at least 48 of 315 Conservative MPs signing off.\n\nThe EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier called the draft deal \"a decisive step toward concluding this negotiation\" and signalled that EU leaders can convene a summit soon to endorse it.\n\nBarnier told reporters Wednesday, \"I consider that we have achieved 'decisive progress\"' \u2014 the announcement that EU leaders had been awaiting from him to call a summit.\n\nBarnier didn't directly address the summit or its possible date, although Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said that a leaders' meeting is penciled in for Nov. 25.\n\nAnti-Brexit demonstrators protest outside Parliament on Wednesday. May has been adamant there won't another referendum on leaving the European Union. (Matt Dunham/Associated Press)\n\nMay repeated her pledge earlier in the day that there would not be another public vote. The Leave vote comprised 51.9 per cent of voters in 2016.\n\n\"We will not rerun the referendum, we will not renege on the decision of the British people,\" she told Parliament.\n\n\"We will deliver Brexit and the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union on the 29th of March 2019,\" she added.\n\nMay said that in the post-Brexit landscape, Britain will be able to strike independent trade deals with countries around the world, but she will need to convince at least some members of other parties.\n\nThe Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), whose seats have helped keep May's government in power, said it would not back any deal that treated the British province differently from the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\n\"If she decides to go against all of that, then there will be consequences,\" DUP leader Arlene Foster said.\n\n'Bungled negotiations'\n\nIan Blackburn, MP from the Scottish National Party, called May \"hamstrung, divided, desperate and looking defeated.\"\n\nOpposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn told the British Parliament the deal follows two years of \"bungled negotiations\" and that May is putting a false choice before MPs, between \"her botched deal or no deal.\"\n\n\"It breaches the prime minister's own red lines,\" he said. \"It doesn't deliver a strong economic deal that supports jobs and industry, and we know they haven't prepared seriously for 'no deal'.\"\n\nThe divorce also needs to be approved by the EU and European Parliaments, while Ireland's Leo Varadkar has promised his own Parliament a vote on the draft deal.\n\nVaradkar told Irish lawmakers on Wednesday that \"we are close\" to \"a legally binding and legally operable withdrawal agreement.\" But he says nothing is guaranteed, and a lot of things can still go wrong.\n\nConservative lawmakers opposed to May since at least when she unveiled her so-called Chequers plan will have to weigh the implications of defeating the deal. The consequences could include May's departure as leader, and a national election they could very well lose to Labour.\n\nA no-deal Brexit would also pitch the world's fifth largest economy into the unknown during a time Western countries are already grappling with the unconventional U.S. presidency of Donald Trump and growing assertiveness from Russia and China.\n\nWith files from CBC and The Associated Press"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "DAPHNE SANTOS-VIEIRA", "title": "Natalie Lim from Vancouver wins the 2018 CBC Poetry Prize for Arrhythmia", "description": "Lim will receive $6,000 from the Canada Council for the Arts and a writing residency at the Banff Centre.

The Alberta government, under Hoffman, exempted Covenant from having to provide access to those services.\n\nCovenant Health's enforcement of its policy has led to increased suffering for patients simply trying to exercise their legal right to an assisted death.\n\nIn 2016, Bob Hergott, a 72-year-old ALS patient who was effectively paralyzed, had to sign his form requesting an assisted death in a bus shelter across the street from his Covenant Health hospital.\n\nAnother ALS patient, 66-year-old Doreen Nowicki, was forced to have her assisted-dying assessment on an Edmonton sidewalk in May 2017 after Covenant suddenly withdrew permission for her to have it by her palliative bed.\n\nIn July 2016, an AHS doctor complained in an email to Hoffman about how one rural patient nearly bled out and died after Covenant Health initially prevented him from accessing assisted-dying services.\n\nNo excuse for inaction, critics say\n\nThe doctor asked Hoffman why Covenant Health, a publicly funded health provider, was allowed to discriminate against patients seeking assisted-dying services.\n\n\n\n\"Is this the type of care that Canadians and Albertans expect and deserve? Where is the dignity for this patient?\" the doctor asked her.\n\nIn her response, Hoffman gave no indication she was prepared to act on the issue.\n\n\n\nIn an emailed statement, the minister told CBC News the doctor subsequently discussed concerns with AHS' lead on the MAID program and that AHS then updated its MAID Guide \"to support better discussions with Covenant Health.\"\n\n\n\nBradley Peter, an Edmonton director of Dying with Dignity Canada, said Hoffman's response was inadequate.\n\n\n\n\"Now that we find out that actually, for two years, this policy has been harming patients, their families, and even the care providers, there is really no excuse at this point as to why this hasn't been dealt with yet,\" Peter said.\n\n\n\nDying with Dignity Canada called for Hoffman and her government to \"immediately rectify\" the situation and end Covenant's policy of forced transfers, including for the assisted-dying procedure itself.\n\n\n\n\"Not a single (other) Albertan should be forced to leave a publicly funded health-care facility to access their human right of medical aid in dying,\" Peter said.\n\n\"This is the 21st century\"\n\nIn response to a CBC News' investigation, Covenant Health said it is reviewing its policy to \"clarify\" its language around the \"exceptional\" cases where patients are allowed to sign MAID forms and have assessments in its facilities.

He then abruptly sent a photo of his genitals.\n\n\"I felt like I could handle it prior to the phone call,\" she said.\n\nThe phone call, which police said they tracked to a Walmart payphone, was from a man telling her he would take advantage of her while getting a massage treatment next time he books.\n\nPanic attack\n\nThe woman chooses to work from home because she is a single parent, and wants to be able to balance time with her family.\n\nThat incident made her take a break from clients at home and, she said, pick up a shifts at a clinic she also sometimes works for.\n\nShe said she felt a panic attack coming on when she was working on a male client following that incident.\n\nShe advertises online, and in a nearby salon. Her ads specify she's not offering \"extras.\"\n\nProfession 'not regulated'\n\nHeather Kew, a long-time professional and vice president of the Massage Therapist Association of Alberta, said the woman's experience is becoming less common, but her group still hears complaints about it.\n\n\"There is this confusion within our profession because we're not regulated,\" Kew said.\n\n\"Often we're seeing people who work in the sex trade using this term or title for themselves \u2026 the public does not understand who is the registered massage therapist.\"\n\nAlberta doesn't have a regulatory body for massage therapists.\n\nLobbying for change\n\nMassage therapy is governed by three main associations: the Massage Therapists Association of Alberta, the Remedial Massage Therapists Association and the Natural Health Practitioners of Canada.\n\nKew said the major massage associations are actively lobbying the government to create a governing body that would protect the registered massage therapist designation.\n\nIn the last few years the amalgamated group known as the Transitional Council for the College of Massage Therapists of Alberta has formed to create governing documents, which were completed this summer.\n\nAssociation hopes for legislation soon\n\n\"The profession is waiting for the government to open up the Health Professions Act and amend that act to include massage therapy,\" Kew said.\n\n\"We are waiting for the government to complete the work it needs to do.\"\n\nShe said it's unclear how long it might take, but they have received positive feedback. They hope the act will be amended in the fall session.\n\nSafety is primary issue: police\n\nStaff Sgt. Bruce Walker with the sex crimes unit said most sexual crimes are underreported. He said for people who work in massage therapy, for themselves or at a clinic, safety is the primary issue.\n\n\"Unfortunately, when you're working from home you're inviting complete strangers into your home,\" he said.\n\n\"There are hundreds of businesses of various types where people do operate out of the homes \u2026 there has to be some sort of understanding and proactive measures put in place.\"\n\nHe said some strategies include keeping a record of who is coming and going in the home, records of health and benefit plans, being wary of folks who want to pay using cash and being clear with clients that a massage is a professional service.\n\nWoman has videos, documentation\n\nThe woman said she does a lot to protect herself. She only takes clients who will fill out her forms and provide previous medical history, she has a video recording system set up in her home and she also writes notes and receipts for each visit.\n\n\"There's many people who, once I tell them there's forms to fill out, they decide they don't want to come for a treatment,\" she said.\n\n\"Or they ask me if they can come without doing the forms and just pay cash. I tell them no, that's a requirement and I feel like that weeds out a lot of people.\"\n\nShe also decides whether or not to take on a client based on the way they speak to her.\n\nHer patient forms even include a line, where she has clients read and initial that they agree to a \"no abuse\" policy, and that requests for \"sexual activity\" will not be tolerated.\n\nWhen she went to school, the woman said some professors did mention that massage therapists are often misconstrued with sex workers, and she did expect to sometimes have inappropriate requests on the job.\n\nBut she didn't expect that saying no to requests for sexual acts would become part of every workday.\n\n'More than once a day'\n\n\"Sometimes it's more than once a day and I feel like it's unfortunate,\" she said.\n\n\"I have to post on my ads that I don't provide those kinds of services which I feel like I shouldn't have to.\"\n\nShe said having a regulatory body in Alberta might help educate the public and weed out massage therapists who might be providing \"extras\" or people who pose as massage therapists.\n\n\"We aren't here for your sexual needs, we're here for health and wellness,\" she said. \"We can't do that if we're pulled down by these people who are trying to take advantage of us.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Boeing didn't disclose control feature eyed in Indonesia crash, U.S. pilots say", "description": "Boeing didn't tell airline pilots about features of a new flight-control system in its 737 MAX that reportedly is a focus of the investigation into last month's deadly crash in Indonesia, according to pilots who fly the jet in the U.S.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/boeing-737-max-anti-stall-system-safety-1.4904544", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4904547.1542191700!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/boeing-controls.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T12:02:47Z", "content": "Boeing didn't tell airline pilots about features of a new flight-control system in its 737 MAX that reportedly is a focus of the investigation into last month's deadly crash in Indonesia, according to pilots who fly the jet in the U.S. Pilots say they were no\u2026 [+3919 chars]", "fulltext": "Boeing didn't tell airline pilots about features of a new flight-control system in its 737 Max that reportedly is a focus of the investigation into last month's deadly crash in Indonesia, according to pilots who fly the jet in the U.S.\n\nPilots say they were not trained in new features of an anti-stall system in the aircraft that differ from previous models of the popular 737.\n\nThe automated system is designed to help pilots avoid raising the plane's nose too high, which can cause the plane to stall, or lose the aerodynamic lift needed to keep flying.

That was the norm, he said. Craddock said when he took vendor-paid trips they were always approved by the CEO, except for the PGA trip.\n\n\"It was a standing principle that where possible we would leverage vendor supported funding to attend conferences and different national or international meetings,\" said Craddock. \"And that was not exclusive to me or to people in my division. That was more broadly within the organization and was, I guess, led by our CEO at the time.\"\n\nThat CEO, Susan Antosh, was removed from her role in October 2017 and was assigned as a special advisor to the deputy minister of health. She was dismissed from that role in March 2018. No explanation has been offered for her departure.\n\nLate 2017 and early 2018 was a tumultuous time at eHealth.

Dell reseller WBM was offering all-expenses paid trips to a conference in Austin, Texas, for Craddock and some eHealth staff.\n\nIn the meeting, Craddock said, it was noted that employees of the Saskatoon, Regina and Prairie North health divisions were also sending staff on the trip.\n\n\"So we discussed the fact that others from the health system were attending this. The offer was made to us and the decision was made that it would be best that we attended as well,\" said Craddock.\n\nWhile eHealth's policy forbids taking vendor-sponsored trips, the Saskatoon Health Region (SHR) policy says it's OK. It says staff may accept \"tokens exchanged as part of protocol/the normal exchange of hospitality between persons doing business together (including lunches and trips, meals, travel, accommodations paid by the vendor).\"\n\nIf I was to walk back in time would I do things maybe differently? Yeah possibly. - Wilbour Craddock\n\nIn an email from the new Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA), which has subsumed all health regions including Saskatoon, a spokesperson defended the SHR policy.\n\nIt said \"an employee taking a vendor-paid trip is not, in itself, considered to be a conflict of interest.\" It said such trips are permitted if they are for educational purposes and that trips are reviewed by management \"to ensure no conflict exists, and then to confirm safeguards are in place to deter any future related conflict of interest.\"\n\nA few days later, the SHA wrote CBC a follow-up email saying it \"agrees that the former regional health authority (Saskatoon) conflict of interest policies need to be revamped and strengthened into one clear, strong provincial conflict of interest policy. This process is underway.\"\n\nCraddock said that at eHealth, part of the justification for accepting the vendor's offer was that it saved taxpayers money.\n\n\"I think that was part of the underlying rationale as to why we leveraged vendor relationships when we did for conference participation,\" he said. \"It wasn't for every single conference.\"\n\neHealth featured in Dell promotional video\n\nCraddock said that because Saskatchewan was such a key account for Dell, the company asked eHealth if it would participate in a promotional video. It was written into the contract between the two entities he said.\n\nWilbour Craddock says as part of eHealth's contract with Dell, the crown corporation agreed to do some promotion of the company. 1:27\n\n\"The commitment was that if we took that on we would do some promotion material with them. So the creation of the video was one of the promotion items that we did. I spoke at a conference at a breakfast session for them. I spoke at another conference out in Vancouver at an evening session.\"\n\nIn the video, Craddock talks about one of the attractions of working with Dell and \"the value of the Federation End-User Computing Solution to their managed service delivery.\"\n\n\"We're looking for partners, not vendors,\" Craddock says in the video. \"We have a lot of vendors but the Federation, we're partnering with them because of the outcomes that we're trying to drive towards.\"\n\nCompanies offer trips to curry favour: expert\n\nMaureen Kilgour, who's an expert in business ethics and corruption, said the practices at eHealth and the Saskatoon Health Region are surprising and troubling.\n\nShe said a public entity agreeing to do a promotional video for a private company is \"sort of weird\" and problematic.\n\n\"You stop seeing the separation between the contractor and the contractee,\" said Kilgour. \"These public sector officials are supposed to be representing the public interest and we're seeing like blurring of the relationship between the people that we in the public would be engaging to provide services to us.\"\n\nMaureen Kilgour, an associate professor of business at the University of Winnipeg, said conflict of interest policy exists to protect the public and public employees. (CBC)\n\nShe said conflict of interest policies are in place to protect public sector employees and the public from corporations seeking undue influence through gifts.\n\n\"Companies offer these things for a reason - because it's part of their own cost of doing business. They're trying to curry favour, build relationships and that's really part of their marketing,\" she said.\n\n\"We know that influence matters right? That's why companies spend so much money on doing that.\"\n\nShe said she was \"shocked\" to see that the Saskatoon Health Region explicitly allows vendor paid trips.\n\nShe said the problem with these sorts of gifts is they don't promote transparency and are liable to abuse or, at the very least, suspicion.\n\n\"We would never know if there was some sort of favourable treatment because of these trips. That's why we always talk about perceived conflict of interest,\" she said.\n\nKilgour said she's not surprised to see that private companies are offering these sorts of trips - it's what they do. But she said politicians and bureaucrats should follow a higher standard.\n\n\"All of these policies are really there to prevent any influence on decision making in the public and really to avoid any risk or even a perceived conflict of interest perceived influence in procurement.\"\n\nRunning the public sector \"more like a business\"\n\nCraddock said attending the Dell conference in Austin made a lot of sense for people in the Saskatchewan health care system.\n\nHe said eHealth and the entire system were big Dell customers.\n\nCraddock sat in on a small group session with Dell founder and CEO Michael Dell and he learned what Dell was planning for the future.

With that financial help, Basu was able to assemble a group of eight sponsors and bring over a refugee from the Middle East within just two months.\n\n\"It's really exciting,\" Basu told CBC. \"There's so many people who are refugees in the world and who need a place to live and are being persecuted.

Any empty spaces would disappear once the year was out.\n\nThat's when Vancouver's Giustra Foundation, along with the U.S.-based Shapiro Foundation and the University of Ottawa Refugee Hub and Jewish Family Services, stepped in and created a fund to help community groups cover the cost to sponsor refugees.\n\nThe aim of the fund was ensure that no spaces would go unfilled because of lack of money. It costs about $18,000 for a private sponsor to welcome a family of four through BVOR \u2014 the rest of the price tag is covered by the federal government.\n\nWith the $3.5 million raised by eight philanthropists, including Vancouver's Aquilini Group and local residents Brian Paes-Braga and Harald and Sharlene Ludwig, groups in 49 communities across the country were able to sponsor refugees.\n\nVancouver businessman Frank Giustra, founder and president of the Giustra Foundation, said he was \"incredibly proud\" of the effort.\n\nIn a written statement, Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen thanked the donors for stepping up.\n\n\"We have seen how the generosity of Canadians has changed the lives of refugees for the better and the success of this initiative is a testament to that generosity,\" Hussen said."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Ariana Kelland", "title": "Couple says witless reasons at root of order to tear down chicken coop in Witless Bay", "description": "They just wanted to raise three chickens, but the town council and a family of complainants had other ideas, says a couple in Witless Bay.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/chicken-coop-witless-bay-1.4903884", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4903888.1542140760!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/gideon-barker-and-jaclyn-humphries.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T11:54:07Z", "content": "There ain't nobody here but three chickens McNugget, Bean and Lentil, to be specific but the Town of Witless Bay has ordered their little, yellow coop must go.

In fact, Barker said, there are two other chicken coops on their street.\n\nBarker said they applied to build a coop in June 2017, a time when the Witless Bay town council was in turmoil.\n\nIts mayor had resigned, council meetings went off the rails, and council matters weren't able to be dealt with because of a lack of members.\n\n\"The council was in disarray. They weren't sitting whatsoever. So, they weren't able to hold a quorum to be able to approve our permit,\" Barker said.\n\n\"We waited three full months and when the weather was beginning to change and our coop was still at our previous house that we had completely moved out of, we were pretty well pressured to bring our coop here.\"\n\nThe couple built the coop without the proper permit.

We just cannot comprehend why this is such an issue and yet, for this council, and for the couple people who we unfortunately live near, this is a big issue.\"\n\n'Not discouraging livestock'\n\nMeanwhile, the town is standing by its decision, saying the coop was built without a permit, on an undersized lot.\n\n\"The town did receive submissions from neighbours who opposed the application for the proposed chicken coop, council reviewed the submissions, and made a decision based on the concerns addressed within them,\" said a statement provided by Witless Bay town council Wednesday.\n\nThe council is adamant Witless Bay is not \"discouraging livestock,\" but it has to be operating within the rules.\n\nJaclyn Humphries feeds her three chickens at the controversial coop outside their home in Witless Bay.

He was ruled brain dead, but his heart was still beating.\n\nIt was a tragedy that set into motion the first successful heart transplant in Canadian history, which marks its 50th anniversary on Saturday.\n\n\"We never had any hesitation,\" said Dr. John K. Wilson, now 93. \"We were ready. The team was ready.\"\n\nA year earlier, in 1967, Wilson had identified a potential recipient for a heart transplant, Charles Perrin Johnston, who had been suffering from heart failure and appeared headed toward an early death.\n\n\"I told him at the time, almost facetiously, 'Hey, maybe we can give you a new heart in a year's time,'\" Wilson remembers telling Perrin Johnston.\n\nCharles Perrin Johnston lived for six years after receiving a new heart in 1968. At the time of his death, no transplant recipient had lived longer. (St. Michael's Hospital)\n\nThe golden age of cardiology\n\nIn December 1967, the South African doctor Christiaan Barnard performed the world's first human-to-human heart transplant \u2014 an earlier transplant had been attempted using a chimpanzee heart \u2014 though the recipient lived for just 18 days after the surgery.\n\nIn Canada, several hospitals were jockeying to become the first to replicate the operation, though early attempts were met with fast deaths or incapacitated patients.\n\nIn May of 1968, Albert Murphy became the first Canadian to receive a new heart, though he died within hours of the operation, performed at the Montreal Heart Institute.\n\nIn the following months, Toronto General and Toronto Western hospitals also attempted heart transplants, though none of the patients recovered.\n\nIn the wake of multiple failures and amidst a growing media frenzy around the race between the three Toronto hospitals, the team at St. Michael's took their shot at the potentially life-saving operation on Nov. 17, 1968.\n\nThe transplant was to be led by Dr. Clare Baker, with Wilson providing support during Perrin Johnston's recovery. Dr. James Yao, Dr. Bernadette Garvey and Dr. John Hart also contributed to the operation.\n\nDr. Clare Baker was the lead surgeon who carried out the operation. Baker died in 2010. (St. Michael's Hospital)\n\n\"We had to have confidence. And if anybody gave the image of being a confident performer, a confident surgeon, a capable surgeon, it was Dr. Clare Baker,\" Wilson remembered about his colleague, who died in 2010.\n\nThat confidence and preparation ultimately translated into a successful surgery.\n\n\"He left the operating room like any other patient, with a beating heart,\" Wilson said.\n\nPerrin Johnston went on to live six years with his new heart. At the time of his death, he was the longest lived male heart transplant recipient in the world.\n\nWhen doctors later asked him how they did it, \"maybe we said more prayers at St. Michael's Hospital,\" Wilson would say with a laugh.\n\nSurgery inspired future doctors\n\nShortly after Perrin Johnston's transplant, Dr. Robert Chisholm arrived at St. Michael's as a medical student. He says the experience of watching Dr. Wilson and Dr. Baker during their breakthrough years altered the course of his career.\n\n\"That two month experienced changed my life,\" said Chisholm, who started his tenure at St. Mike's without a medical specialty. He has now worked as a cardiologist at the hospital since the 1970s.\n\n\"It was a very exciting time because the world was kind of watching us,\" he added. \"We had pretty good success in those early days.\"\n\nDr. Robert Chisholm worked with Dr. John K. Wilson and Dr. Clare Baker as a student in the late 1960s. The experience inspired him to pursue a speciality in cardiology. (Martin Trainor/CBC)\n\nWhile the techniques used in cardiology have advanced considerably since the 1960s, Chisholm says the approach taken by Wilson and Baker should serve as a powerful lesson to their modern contemporaries.\n\n\"The key to their success, I think, was judgment,\" he said. \"And that still applies today.\"\n\nFailed surgeries following breakthrough\n\nFollowing Perrin Johnston's surgery, Baker, Wilson and the St. Michael's cardiology team travelled around the world, sharing their findings at medical conferences filled with doctors still struggling to perform the operation.\n\nIn total, Wilson and the team carried out five heart transplants at St. Michael's, though the last two were unsuccessful.\n\nThey stopped performing transplants after those failures, due to advancements in other areas of cardiology and a need for anti-rejection medications that were not yet developed.\n\nStill, Wilson looks back fondly on his years at the cutting edge of the specialty, knowing that his team's success informed the work of doctors around the world, and elevated the profile of his hospital as a result.\n\n\"We were pretty proud that we were able to present a successful transplant,\" he said. \"We showed that it can be done.\"\n\nAccording to the latest figures from the Canadian Institute for Health Information, 170 Canadians received heart transplants in 2015."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Shane Magee", "title": "Elections NB uses Facebook ads to spur people to run in byelections", "description": "Elections NB has bought geo-targeted Facebook ads in communities across the province where municipal byelections will be held next month in the hopes people will put their names forward as nominees by Friday.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/elections-nb-facebook-ads-byelections-1.4903844", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3574716.1462853023!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/elections-new-brunswick.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T11:00:00Z", "content": "Elections NB is using geo-targeted ads on Facebook in the hopes of garnering more nominations for upcoming municipal byelections.

In 2015, there were 47. Their ranks are shrinking as some drivers quit or are let go by taxi companies for poor performance.\n\nTerry Morier is one of only 18 accessible-cab drivers left in the city. He said the work is gratifying, but the accessible cab system needs to be fixed. (Dave Laughlin/CBC)\n\nThe problem boils down to supply and demand, dollars and cents, and a few unwilling drivers, according to veteran driver Terry Morier, who still gets behind the wheel of one of the few remaining accessible taxis.\n\nHe said the accessible-taxi system is \"not working.\" Wheelchair-accessible vans are more expensive to buy, must be modified to CSA taxi standard and cost more to operate.\n\nThe calls from passengers with disabilities are sporadic and come from across the municipality \u2014 for fares that are sometimes just a few dollars. The result, Morier said, is some drivers don't bother with those calls.\n\nOn Oct. 24, Wendy had catheter surgery at the Victoria General hospital site. It took much longer than expected, and she wasn't settled in her hospital bed until around 8:30 p.m.\n\nHer husband, who also uses a wheelchair, made a promise that left him in a predicament.\n\n\"I can't leave until I find out what's going on with my wife, and the other part is how I'm going to get home,\" said Guy.\n\nWhen he called for an accessible cab, there weren't any, and he was running out of medication. Fortunately, a nurse turned a chair into a makeshift bed for Guy, and a doctor wrote him a prescription he filled at the pharmacy in the hospital.\n\nThe day after the surgery, Wendy was well enough to go home. The couple went by Access-A-Bus, the city's paratransit service, because she had correctly guessed her discharge time when she booked it the previous week. The service requires seven-day advance booking.\n\nWendy White shows her log of calls attempting to get a cab or bus to take her to the hospital. She called 311 to complain when she was unsuccessful. (Elizabeth Chiu/CBC)\n\nTaxi woes cropped up again several days later. Wendy's VON nurse discovered pus seeping from her wound, and her doctor wanted her back at the hospital the next morning.\n\nWendy called the city's two main cab companies, two drivers directly and a private transportation service. But none were available. She also phoned Access-A-Bus. She was told 45 people were ahead of her.\n\nGuy urged Wendy to call 911 for an ambulance, but she refused. Cost was a factor for a couple living on a disability pension. Plus, Wendy said she didn't want to take paramedics from more critical calls.\n\nSo, she motored 300 metres to the bus stop, caught a Halifax Transit bus equipped to lower to curb height, and then navigated around a construction zone near the hospital to have her infected wound checked.\n\nShe wanted to take a cab back home, but her go-to driver had a broken transmission. So, she got herself on another bus.\n\n\"I was extra cautious over any bumps, anything that might dislodge my tubing or my drainage or my catheter or undo stitches,\" she said.\n\nMorier has logged nearly 570,000 kilometres in six years on his wheelchair-accessible taxi. (Dave Laughlin/CBC)\n\nMorier said the couple's situation is \"pretty desperate.\" He's one of the dwindling number of accessible taxi drivers sticking it out. Six years ago, one of his regular clients became paralyzed in a motorcycle accident and asked him to consider accessible-taxi work.\n\nMorier answered the call and invested $70,000 in a van that can accommodate up to two small-power wheelchairs. He works 12 hours a day, or longer, and his van has logged nearly 570,000 kilometres in six years.\n\nHe must accept dispatched calls from Dartmouth, Lower Sackville, Bedford or even further for potentially only a $5 fare.\n\nHe said he would \"go broke\" serving only accessible clients because the calls are infrequent, are from passengers who can take longer to serve, and are spread out over the large municipality \u2014 using more gas and time.\n\nSo, Morier works on a system of pre-booked calls from his 1,500 clients \u2014 114 are in wheelchairs \u2014 while also accepting dispatched calls and fares off the street.\n\nHe said his clients with disabilities are satisfied even though they know \"there are times they just cannot get me, even my regulars.\"\n\nCalling out cabbies\n\nBrian Herman, a co-owner of Casino Taxi, the city's largest taxi dispatch company, said it had 35 accessible taxi drivers at its peak in 2015-16. But now there are only five.\n\nHe said about 20 drivers have quit, while the company \"parted ways\" with about 10 who repeatedly refused calls from people with disabilities \u2014 a violation of Casino's policy.\n\nHerman said the problem is that accessible calls are more costly than conventional fares and cabbies wind up losing money. There are higher expenses, it takes longer to load and unload passengers, and the fares are often smaller.\n\nHe said to increase on-demand availability, the solution lies with the government to provide a subsidy of about $10 or $15 to taxi drivers to compensate for fares that are otherwise money-losing.\n\nMorier believes there are enough accessible-taxi drivers to serve the city's disabled community \u2014 if all of them were doing their jobs properly. The availability issues, he said, won't be easily fixed without incentives to drivers to fulfil their duties.\n\nHe recalls when the province used to offer a grant to modify taxis into accessible vehicles. The province spent nearly $200,000 converting 11 cabs. But in 2013, funding was shifted to not-for-profit community transit groups.\n\nDespite all the challenges, Morier said the gratitude from customers with disabilities keeps him behind the wheel.\n\n\"It makes it worthwhile for me,\" he said.\n\nGerry Post is the executive director of the Nova Scotia's Accessibility Directorate. (Dave Laughlin/CBC)\n\nGerry Post, the executive director of Nova Scotia's Accessibility Directorate, which is charged with implementing the Accessibility Act, said the story of Wendy and Guy White is sad, unfair and raises a health issue. He regularly hears from people in similar predicaments.\n\nBased on 2014 data, Post calculates the cost to the Halifax Regional Municipality for an Access-A-Bus trip is $37, compared to $14.50 for the same trip by accessible taxi.\n\nHe said if the municipality were to supplement Access-A-Bus with accessible taxis, it would double the number of paratransit trips under the same budget and get more accessible taxis on the road by outsourcing to the taxi industry. Post said similar models exist in other Canadian cities such as Toronto.\n\nThe municipality is spending $3.9 million to add 10 new accessible buses and replace 21 in its Access-A-Bus fleet of 40 vehicles over the next three years.\n\nIt has also tried to increase the number of accessible cabs by not limiting their numbers \u2014 unlike conventional cabs, which are capped at 1,000.\n\nA consultant hired by the city has reviewed the city's taxi industry \u2014 including accessibility. A survey was also conducted to gather thoughts from residents, however none of the questions specifically pertained to accessibility. The report and survey results are expected in the coming months.\n\nIn the last two years, the municipality has received 15 accessible-taxi complaints, three regarding availability.\n\nWendy White lodged one, and she also wrote about her experience to the mayor, her MLA, and her councillor."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Elysha Enos", "title": "First he takes Manhattan: MAC's Leonard Cohen exhibition gets international tour", "description": "Montreal's Mus\u00e9e d'art contemporain (MAC) has officially announced the international tour of its blockbuster Leonard Cohen: A Crack in Everything exhibition, which kicks off in New York City in the spring.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/mac-leonard-cohen-nyc-manhattan-tour-1.4904265", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4390260.1510008359!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/cohen-exhibition.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T10:00:00Z", "content": "Montreal's Contemporary Art Museum (MAC) has officially announced the international tour of its blockbuster Leonard Cohen: A Crack in Everything exhibition, which kicks off in New York City in the spring.

One staff member described the intercoms as a \"nuisance.\"\n\nInmates explained how they yelled to the person inside the barrier-free cell \u2014 a cell designed for people with physical disabilities \u2014 but that button also didn't work.\n\nAs a result, inmates resorted to waving their arms through food slots and yelling to get the attention of correctional officers.\n\nIn his memo, Kelly says \"there was no documentation to explain why the intercom was disabled.\"\n\nIn addition, he said supervisory approval wasn't sought, offenders weren't told the intercoms were disabled and the buttons didn't work for \"a period beyond 24 hours.\"\n\nKelly asked for barrier-free cells in living areas to be included in the regular audit of intercoms. There was no directive for other cells to have intercoms turned back on.\n\nUnion reaction\n\nPresident Jason MacLean of the Nova Scotia Government & General Employees Union (NSGEU), which represents correctional officers at provincial jails, said it makes sense to have intercoms in barrier-free cells, but otherwise agrees they are an unnecessary annoyance.\n\nA former jail guard, MacLean also points out that correctional officers do not have the authority to disable intercoms.\n\n\"This has been an issue ever since Central Nova Correctional Facility opened up, and actually it's been such a nuisance and hindrance of getting work done in the other facilities that intercoms weren't part of the plan,\" he said.\n\n\"So if you look at Northeast Nova, there are no intercoms. Why? Because intercoms were being abused.\"\n\nJason MacLean is the president of the union that represents provincial corrections workers. (CBC)\n\nMacLean said chronic understaffing at the Burnside jail, paired with the presence of street drugs, creates an unsafe environment for correctional officers. However, he adds the recent addition of body scanners has made a difference finding contraband.\n\n\"That's been a huge help. There's been a lot of packages found and everything else. It makes it a safer place,\" said MacLean.\n\n'Veil of secrecy'\n\nEven though some progress has been made since Cromwell's death four years ago, Maxwell can't understand why the province continues to limit information. He says that has been the biggest frustration for Cromwell's family.\n\n\"The province's approach to Clayton's death and conditions in the jail in general has been a difficult thing,\" Maxwell said.\n\n\"You know their efforts to keep a veil of secrecy over as much of this as possible, whether it's with us, whether it's with the media, whether it's with the general public has been a frustrating thing to watch for them.\"\n\nThe Canadian Press fought for access to internal reports relating to Cromwell's death and were denied. A review prompted Nova Scotia's privacy commissioner to speak out against the province, which then led to the release of redacted documents.\n\n\"Beth's main goal in this is to achieve change. She wants the system to change. She doesn't want anyone else to go through what she and her family has gone through,\" said Maxwell."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Julia Wright", "title": "'Couldn't believe it': Long-lost sisters reunited by DNA test", "description": "Two New Brunswick seniors have forged an unexpected friendship after a DNA test kit revealed they are long-lost sisters from Prince Edward Island.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/dna-test-sisters-new-brunswick-1.4904225", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4904247.1542152592!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/gladys-craig-and-betty-mcmurray.JPG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T10:00:00Z", "content": "Two New Brunswick women are forging an unexpected friendship after a DNA test kit revealed they're long-lost sisters from Prince Edward Island.

So what are the alternatives? CBC New Brunswick's Maria Jose Burgos explains why beet juice might be a good choice. 2:26\n\nHe said the salt isn't working to melt all the snow on the road. Instead, the salt is creating a layer of brine between the snow and the pavement to prevent snow from freezing to the road.\n\n\"If the snow freezes to the road that's when we're in a position where the day after a storm, we would not have bare roads,\" he said.\n\n\"The salt isn't intended to melt every piece of snow that falls out of the sky.\""}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Canada Post workers back on the picket line in St. John's", "description": "A federally-appointed mediator oversaw negotiations between Canada Post and the union for nearly three weeks, but the talks failed and workers are back on rotating picket lines.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/canada-post-avalon-back-on-strike-1.4904529", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4904531.1542188802!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/canada-post-workers-strike-newfoundland.jpeg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T09:47:39Z", "content": "Canada Post workers at the main sorting station on Kenmount Road in St. John's are out in the wet snow Wednesday morning to stand on the picket line.

They recoiled at the idea of sharing power with ordinary folk, fearing the hoi polloi would just screw things up (see The Federalist Papers #10). So the constitution they produced directed state legislatures to choose their own U.S. senators.\n\nStatewide popular elections for the U.S. Senate are relatively modern and didn't fully evolve until after the 17th Amendment was passed in 1913.\n\nBut as they evolved, U.S. elections still kept more space for raw politics than has survived in many other modern democracies \u2014 including Canada \u2014 and that appears to be a big part of the problem we're seeing now.\n\nCanadian way\n\nElections Canada is the independent supervisor of elections, and independent provincial boundary commissions oversee the drawing of electoral districts across the country. That seems to work for Canada, at least by comparison to the U.S.\n\nIn the U.S., almost everything that matters in elections is controlled in each state by the party in power.\n\nRick Scott, governor of Florida and Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, ignored Nelson's call for him to recuse himself from the recount process. (Reuters)\n\nAnd so in Florida, last week's midterm elections were overseen by Ken Detzner, a former hired gun for the state's beer industry who was appointed secretary of state by Gov. Rick Scott.\n\nScott, who is now also the Republican candidate for the Senate in the election under review, remained Detzner's boss even while Detzner supervised the recount that will decide whether Governor Scott becomes Senator Scott \u2014 to which the other candidate, Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, effectively replied: You're kidding me, right?\n\nNelson has accused Scott of \"using his power as governor to undermine the voting process.\"\n\n\"He's thrown around words like voter fraud, with no proof,\" Nelson told a news conference in Washington on Tuesday.\n\nThe latter part is certainly true. Scott and other Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, have encouraged Americans to believe there's something rotten going on in Broward County.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio of Florida, left, on the trail with gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis. Rubio has alleged there have been rampant violations of election laws in Florida, but legal authorities in the state have found no evidence of any offences.

Nelson told reporters both offices had investigated and found no credible evidence of voter fraud in the election.\n\nNevertheless, he concluded, the setup is ripe for corruption and Scott must recuse himself.\n\n\"Mr. Scott cannot oversee the process in a fair and impartial way and he should remove himself from the recount process.\"\n\nOn Wednesday morning, a lawyer for Scott told a federal judge that the governor will recuse himself from the state panel responsible for certifying the Senate election results. Scott confirmed the news on Twitter.\n\nI recused myself from certifying results on the Elections Canvassing Commission in 2014, and I will do so again this year. This is nothing new. Bill Nelson is confused and doesn\u2019t even know how Florida works- I have no role in supervising/ overseeing the ongoing recount process. \u2014@ScottforFlorida\n\nScott was also effectively overseeing the recount in the gubernatorial race to elect his successor, but that race is less controversial and has reportedly been all but conceded by Democrat Andrew Gillum to Republican Ron DeSantis.\n\nIt's churlish to expect Scott to be thrilled about a recount in an election that he appeared to have won a week ago. But the machine recount is showing the race is much tighter than first thought and so it's likely to push the process to its next stage \u2014 a hand recount.\n\nAndrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida, trails his Republican rival, Ron DeSantis, by more than 30,000 votes. The deadline for the results of the machine recount is Thursday. (Jennifer Lett/South Florida Sun-Sentinel/ Associated Press)\n\nSome in the pundit class have declared Nelson an almost hopeless long shot, and in doing so, have made Scott's complaints about the recount look suspicious \u2014 which isn't helpful to anyone.\n\nRepublicans challenge whether the recount should have proceeded at all, but now that it's happening, it appears to be following clearly defined rules that are not out of step with what happens in other states. And it is those rules that have determined Nelson's shot is close enough to be taken seriously.\n\nSo the effect of both Scott's and Nelson's tactics, as well as the media questioning whether Nelson even has a chance, is to undermine public confidence in the fairness of the election.\n\nTrump revives 2016 tactic\n\nAnd that, again, is to say nothing of the president's behaviour, so let's get to that.\n\nTrump has not only tweeted \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 that many ballots in Florida are missing or forged, he has also called for the recount to stop and for Scott to be declared the winner.\n\n\"An honest vote count is no longer possible,\" he claimed with utter disregard for the millions of voters who might think otherwise and for the military servicemen and women whose votes are still to be counted.\n\nThe Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged.

In casino capitalism, he says, \"What goes up must come down.\"\n\nCertainly if shares were to continue their recent declines, all that money removed from government revenue and used to bid up stocks using share buybacks and dividend payments could simply disappear into thin air. Meanwhile, taxpayers will be left with a bigger national debt and increased calls for cuts to public spending to balance the budget.\n\nAs Keynes observed, the purpose of capitalist markets is not to make a fortune in a matter of weeks or months on stock speculation, but instead to raise money for wise and productive investment in the economy.\n\nNorth America has lost jobs because of high wage costs, but even in lower wage places such as China, companies are investing in automation technology. (Reuters)\n\nAnd that was exactly what was supposed to happen with the tax cuts.\n\nAs sold to the American public, giving the tech giants a tax break would encourage them to bring their money home from overseas tax shelters and allow them to invest in the U.S.\n\nInstead of making iPhones in China, for instance, Apple could spend the money on the research and the machinery to create North American jobs.\n\nWhile the U.S. might have had trouble competing on wages, even companies in China are automating their factories. According to President Donald Trump's MAGA rationale, there is no reason why those factories, the new technology to run them, and the high-paying jobs to make it all happen could not be located in the U.S. instead of China.\n\nIn fact, the name of the bill said it all. When the tax-cutting legislation was presented to Congress at the end of last year it was introduced as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\nYet, despite the plunging U.S. unemployment rate, jobs continue to go abroad while investors get rich on speculation.\n\n'Good for shareholders'\n\nCalculations by the London Financial Times show that so far this year, five of the biggest U.S. technology companies, including Apple and Google parent Alphabet, spent a combined total of $115 billion buying back their own shares.\n\n\"Outlay on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/buybacks?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#buybacks</a> almost doubles, putting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/investors?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#investors</a> among biggest beneficiaries of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Trump?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Trump</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tax?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#tax</a> reforms\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@FT</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/zBbFrQQ3VW\">https://t.co/zBbFrQQ3VW</a> \u2014@don_pittis That's about double the amount those companies spent on share buybacks in the previous year, before Trump's tax cuts kicked in. And it represents only a fraction of the estimated $1 trillion US paid back to shareholders of tech and non-tech companies.\n\n\"Most companies are using cash to buy back stock and make acquisitions, rather than invest in new facilities,\" Allianz investment manager Walter Price told the Financial Times. \"I think this is good for shareholders and management.\"\n\nIn theory, the money that goes to buybacks could eventually return to the economy, and certainly some of it does. For example, shareholders might sell their stocks and spend the money on restaurant meals, recirculating the cash into the economy. Or they could take the money and use it to hire people for a startup business.\n\nFailure to invest in the future\n\nBut according to Rochon, in a \"financialized\" economy neither of those things tend to happen. The very rich who own most of the stock don't circulate much of their wealth into the real economy. And when they sell shares, rather than investing in something entrepreneurial, they tend to use the money to buy some other financial investment in hope of further speculative returns.\n\nRochon says short-termism compounds the problem. Rather than waiting for a long-term investment to pay off at five to seven per cent a year, shareholders and managers \u2014 who are paid bonuses tied to their stock price \u2014 want to see shares rise now. Share buybacks solve that dilemma.\n\nThis photo from the New York Stock Exchange in 1947 shows bulletin clerk Dolores Hennessy changing bid and ask prices. By then, the market had begun to recover from the so-called casino capitalism of the 1920s and '30s. (Dan Grossi/Associated Press)\n\n\"These companies are going to have a problem,\" he says. \"We're going to see old technology, the need for reinvestment, and we're going to look back and say, 'We should have invested 20 years ago instead of buying back.'\"\n\nWhat applies to the individual companies applies to the wider economy as well. Failure by the private sector to invest in new U.S. technology, new U.S. plants, new robots and new jobs will mean the U.S. will find it harder to compete with global challengers, including China.\n\nAnd any of the buyback money that disappears as share prices fall might just as well have been left in the public purse to invest in things like infrastructure and health care and education for the poorest \u2014 things that really could make America great again.\n\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis"}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "Jacques Poitras", "title": "PANB leader calls for House vote if Tories want to frack outside Sussex", "description": "People\u2019s Alliance Leader Kris Austin says the new Higgs government will be making \u201ca wrong move\u201d if it allows shale gas development outside the Sussex area without a vote in the legislature.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fracking-shale-gas-higgs-pcs-austin-peoples-alliance-1.4904357", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4889240.1541173480!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/kris-austin.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T09:00:00Z", "content": "People's Alliance Leader Kris Austin says the new Higgs government will be making \"a wrong move\" if it allows shale gas development outside the Sussex area without a vote in the legislature.

The Gitxsan could then be effectively treated for Long QT syndrome after that discovery.\n\nArbour also sees a need to customize the practices for DNA collection in Indigenous communities so that they maintain control.\n\nOne little-known aspect about most genetic testing projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project or 23andMe, is that they, not the donor, retain ownership of the sample.\n\nIndigenous leaders don't want this to happen in studies of their people.\n\nDNA obtained from an Indigenous individual should be considered \"on loan\" to the researcher just for the purpose of the specific research project, says Arbour. Ownership of the sample should be retained by the individual with the future potential to be stored in a \"tribal-controlled DNA bank,\" she says.\n\nCalls for Indigenous leadership\n\nIndigenous leaders have long recognized the need for Indigenous scientists to take ownership of the research conducted with their DNA.\n\nWriting in the Hill Times last month, Natan Obed, president of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, a national, non-profiit organization representing 60,000 Inuit, said that \"Inuit are the most researched people in the world \u2014 yet with colonial approaches to research \u2026 our role is imagined as marginal and of little value.\"\n\nHe also recently renewed his call for Inuit leadership in the three major Canadian research agencies: the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.\n\nLaura Arbour, one of the lead scientists for the Silent Genome project recently funded by Genome Canada and Genome British Columbia, and her colleagues are trying to develop strategies to better engage Indigenous communities in genomic research. (Brad Lyle, Genome BC)\n\nBuilding capacity for Indigenous leadership in genomic research takes time.\n\nBut real change could come through the work of programs like SING, which stands for the Summer Internship for Indigenous Peoples in Genomics.\n\nThis educational program initiated at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2011 and sponsored by multiple agencies including the National Institutes of Health was geared primarily for Indigenous students in a university undergraduate or graduate degree program in the U.S. but has since spread to Canada and New Zealand.\n\nThe SING workshops aim to give Indigenous students interested in genetic science additional skills and knowledge that would help them move into advisory and leadership roles within genetic research. The workshops of approximately 20 participants have been held annually at multiple U.S. university venues, most recently in Seattle earlier this year.\n\nKatrina Claw, a former SING participant and now a leader of the program in the U.S., says there have been participants from 44 First Nations, including mostly students who are interested in genomic, social and political sciences.\n\nThe SING training workshops include basic scientific methods in DNA sequencing and analysis along with tutorials on the principles of informed consent and ethics relating to DNA data sharing.\n\nFaculty positions\n\nThe Indigenous leader of SING Canada, Kim TallBear, an associate professor in the Faculty of Native Studies at the University of Alberta, says that genomics research must also be taught with the view of correcting the history of disciplinary mistakes made by scientists.\n\nA significant proportion of SING participants enter the program with a background in genomic science or the social and political sciences and with the intention of learning about Indigenous genomics from a \"bioethical and decolonizational perspective,\" said TallBear.\n\nThe goal of the SING workshops is starting to be realized. According to TallBear, Anderson is another great example of someone of Indigenous descent who started with SING as a graduate student, came up through the ranks to become an assistant professor and is already leading discussions around genomic research in Indigenous communities."}, {"source": {"id": "cbc-news", "name": "CBC News"}, "author": "CBC News", "title": "Tree disease leaving 'zombie forest' in its wake, expert warns", "description": "A forester from Bancroft, Ont., says the province could be doing much more to deal with an insidious disease that's killing beech trees across Ontario.", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/beech-tree-disease-death-concerns-1.4902382", "urlToImage": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4900549.1541820550!/fileImage/httpImage/image.PNG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/beech-bark-disease.PNG", "publishedAt": "2018-11-14T09:00:00Z", "content": "A forester from Bancroft, Ont., says the province could be doing much more to deal with an insidious disease that's killing beech trees across Ontario.

This is just money that I am owed.\"\n\nFirst I complained. Then I was fired. It didn't make sense. Because I had been working for them for four years. - Juan Jose Lira Cervantes\n\nUnder Ontario's labour law, independent contractors don't have the same protections as employees.\n\nThey set their own hours and use their own tools, but are not entitled to overtime or vacation pay. In contrast, employees are told when and how to do their work, but are entitled to the minimum wage and overtime pay.\n\nOf the $28,144.54 the company is being ordered to pay Cervantes, $17,539.60 was wages owed for getting below minimum wage.\n\nJuan Jose Lira Cervantes, shown with his eight-year-old son David Lira Pena, has been home since he was taken off the work schedule at Domino's Pizza in April. His wife is now working to support the family while he cares for the four children who still live at home. (Farrah Merali)\n\nThe Ministry of Labour ruling also found that since Cervantes was technically an employee, he was entitled to vacation pay, overtime pay, holiday pay and other benefits, and ordered the company to compensate him.\n\nCervantes also argued he was taken off the work schedule after his employer learned he filed the complaint.\n\n\"First I complained. Then I was fired. It didn't make sense, because I had been working for them for four years,\" said Cervantes.\n\n\"How come all of a sudden I was fired just after I made the complaint?\"\n\nThe ministry found that to be an act of reprisal and said Cervantes must be compensated for that.\n\nThough Cervantes began working for the company in 2013, he can only receive compensation for lost wages and benefits for the past two years. That's because under the Employment Standards Act, an employment standards officer can only issue an order for unpaid wages if the employee has filed a claim within two years of when the wages were due.\n\nOther franchises\n\nIt's not the first time a Domino's Pizza franchise in Ontario has been found in violation of the province's employment laws.\n\nIn February 2017, a worker in Guelph filed a similar claim with the Ministry of Labour, arguing he was doing the work of an employee but was being treated as an independent contractor.\n\nHe was making $5 an hour plus tips. He quit after one week of work.\n\nThe labour minister agreed he too was an employee, and ordered that franchise to compensate him for lost wages.\n\nSimone Ostrowski, with Whitten & Lublin Employment Lawyers, says she's not surprised to hear that even a company as large as Domino's is found to be committing these violations.\n\n\"Certainly in retail and restaurants, it's very common to see the independent contractor versus employee debate,\" said Ostrowski.\n\nToronto labour lawyer Simone Ostrowski said Cervantes's ruling from the Ministry of Labour could have ripple effects across the industry, with other delivery drivers who may be hired as independent contractors. (Farrah Merali)\n\n\"Unfortunately, there's a lot of workers out there in these types of contractor relationships that might not even know that the situation they're in is potentially illegal. And they might not know they have a recourse to complain to the ministry.\".\n\nBased on the arguments listed in the decision, Ostrowski said it's clear Cervantes was an employee and not a contractor, and that this ruling could have have an impact on the industry.\n\n\"I would say that this decision could have ripple effects, perhaps across the entire industry, with respect to delivery drivers who are paid as contractors because the principles are still the same,\" said Ostrowski.\n\n\"They can actually point to this decision and say, 'Look at how the ministry ruled in this case. I'm in a very similar circumstance and you should rule that I'm an employee as well.'\"\n\nCompany won't appeal ruling\n\nUnder ministry rules, the Domino's franchise has 30 days from the time the order is served to file an appeal, but a statement from the company said: \"Our franchisee appeared in front of the Ministry of Labour, responded to the inquiry and will fully comply with the ruling issued by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n\"There are no plans to appeal the ruling,\" said Jeff Kacmarek, vice-president of marketing and new product development with the Domino's Pizza of Canada.\n\nThe Domino's Pizza franchise in Mississauga, Ont., where Cervantes worked for years.

Unfortunately, I think they missed the mark in terms of accessibility and in terms of being able to reach the entire community of Calgary,\" said Sean Crump, head chair and CEO of Universal Access, a company that consults on and certifies accessible buildings.\n\n\"I think architecture is where functionality meets design and if you're not accessible to the entire community I think you've fallen short on the functionality side.\"\n\nCrump uses a motorized wheelchair.\n\nSean Crump said he can't reach the security button to access the elevator from his wheelchair.

And, a security button he needed to use the elevator was out of reach.\n\n\"These oversights, today, are inexcusable,\" he said.\n\nThere were also worries that the sloped sidewalk on the west side of the building is too long, and doesn't feature any handrails.\n\nAnother wheelchair user, Kay Rankin, said she loves the new building and thinks the design is lovely \u2014 other than the self-checkout.\n\nKay Rankin said she can't reach the self-checkout screen from her wheelchair.

Tampa Bay's Kevin Cash was next with five firsts and 57 points.

Milwaukee's Craig Counsell was second with 11 firsts and for 99 points. Colorado's Bud Black was third with 41 points.\n\nSnitker played in Atlanta's minor league system from 1977-80, then worked in the minors as a roving instructor (1981), a manager at rookie league (1996), Class A (1982-84, 1986-87, 1992, 1997-2001), Double-A (2002-05), Triple-A (2006, 2014-16) and a coach at rookie level (1993-94) and Class A (1995). He was with Atlanta as bullpen coach (1985 and 1988-90) and third base coach (2007-13).\n\nHe was managing at Triple-A Gwinnett when he took over Atlanta in May 2016 after Fredi Gonzalez was fired for a 9-28 start.
