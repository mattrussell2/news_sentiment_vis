Dean Heller, winning races for governor and lieutenant governor, and expanding their state legislative majorities.\n\nThe shellacking was 15 years in the making, the culmination of a long-term plan to shift a battleground into the Democratic column. Democrats elsewhere will work to replicate Nevada for years to come. Republicans were humbled.\n\n\u201cThese things can change, but right now Nevada is a blue state,\u201d said Mark Hutchison, the state\u2019s outgoing Republican lieutenant governor. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the Democratic Party has done a very good job in Nevada of getting out the vote and creating an infrastructure that is formidable.\u201d\n\nThe political mastermind behind the Democrats\u2019 ascendency is 78-year-old Harry Reid, the soft-spoken former Senate majority leader who served for decades in Washington before his retirement last year. Despite being treated for pancreatic cancer, Reid has remained active in Nevada politics.\n\nReid started building the state party for the 2004 election, when Nevada was in a tug of war between its Western libertarian roots and the Democratic leanings of recent transplants. The party had no permanent staff in nonelection years; now it has double digits.\n\nSenate Republicans had sent him a warning shot that November by ousting his predecessor as Democratic leader, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota. That led Reid to step up efforts to protect his home flank. He helped make Nevada\u2019s caucuses one of the first-in-the-nation presidential contests and a destination for political spending by national aspirants.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t really matter that his name wasn\u2019t on the ballot, he was all in every day,\u201d said Rebecca Lambe, a longtime Reid aide and Democratic strategist.\n\nReid used the national cash flowing in to build a strong state Democratic Party and bolster a network of pro-immigrant and environmental organizations. They worked with Las Vegas\u2019 potent unions to power a Democratic turnout machine.\n\n\u201cThis is what Democrats need to be doing everywhere. This is the long game,\u201d said Rebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist and former Reid staffer.\n\nNot everything Reid built may be easily exportable.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS FILE - In this April 3, 2018, file photo, former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid speaks during a joint appearance with former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry during a lecture series at the University of Nevada, Reno. He may no longer lead Democrats in the U.S. Senate, but the political machine Reid built to turn Nevada blue is still humming along. Democrats romped up and down the state, ousting Republican Sen. Dean Heller and taking the governorship, lieutenant governor, attorney general and treasurer posts while expanding their state legislative control to supermajorities.(AP Photo/Scott Sonner, File)\n\nNevada has only about 3 million residents, so it\u2019s easy for left-leaning groups to coordinate and have an impact. Most voters are concentrated in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas. It\u2019s a state full of demographic groups that lean Democratic, with 29 percent of its population Latino and only 49 percent white.\n\nLas Vegas\u2019 economy generates lots of working-class, service jobs that can\u2019t be outsourced, making it easier for unions to organize. Most significantly, it\u2019s given birth to the Culinary Union, a 57,000-member political force representing casino workers that helps pad Democratic margins with its voter turnout programs.\n\nBut Nevada Democrats do face obstacles.\n\nThey can only win statewide if they turn out Las Vegas\u2019 transient and diverse workforce. This was one of Reid\u2019s epiphanies in 2004, Lambe said. \u201cThere was a recognition that the electorate didn\u2019t reflect the population of the state.\u201d\n\nOne solution was nonstop voter registration to keep catching new arrivals and adding them to the voter rolls. Doing that, and then turning those hard-to-reach voters out, takes money.\n\nReid is a prolific fundraiser who has been able to keep money flowing to the state. But there is a grim example for Democrats of what can happen when that spigot runs dry.\n\nIn 2014, Reid turned his attention to trying to save Democratic control of the Senate in races outside Nevada. There was no competitive race for governor or Senate to draw Nevada voters\u2019 interest. Door-knocking and voter registration in Las Vegas dwindled. Republicans swept all statewide races, even winning a congressional seat in the heart of Democratic Las Vegas that was called the \u201cCulinary District\u201d because the union had such sway there.\n\nThis year, Reid helped pick candidates and staff for important races and raised money. It\u2019s hard to quantify how the machine is funded because money flows through many different organizations. One measure is that Heller had $35 million spent against him by outside groups, as opposed to $20 million for Democratic opponent, Rep. Jacky Rosen.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Reid Machine\u2019 is synonymous with money,\u201d said Jeremy Hughes, a Republican strategist who advised Heller\u2019s campaign. \u201cIt totally is a resources issue. People believe the Republican Party is the party of large special interests when it is in fact the Democrat Party that had 30 outside special interest groups on the ground. Republicans did not have that.\u201d\n\nNevada Democrats worry that national donors may be overly secure that the state has gone Democratic and they may be less inclined to invest there in 2020, when there is no Senate race on the ballot.\n\n\u201cThe question is, are Democrats going to be able to raise the money when we don\u2019t have a top-of-the-ticket governor and a top-of-the-ticket Senate race,\u201d said Andres Ramirez, a Democratic strategist in Las Vegas and a former Reid staffer.\n\nReid\u2019s hand-picked successor in the Senate, former state Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto, is supposed to take his place as chief organizer and fundraiser for the state\u2019s Democrats. Last week, she was named head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and will oversee the party\u2019s 2020 Senate races. It\u2019s a job that will connect her with many big national donors. But Cortez Masto cannot match Reid\u2019s Senate tenure and connections."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Andy McDonald", "title": "Mark Hamill Confirms Crazy Pitch He Made For Infamous \u2018Star Wars\u2019 Character", "description": "The actor apparently told the idea to creator George Lucas, who promptly rejected it.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mark-hamill-star-wars-boba-fett_us_5bf1d794e4b0f32bd58a985c", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bd60bc11d00008b0030964a.jpeg?cache=vwuou273cm&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T23:34:44Z", "content": "Actor Mark Hamill, aka Luke Skywalker, confirmed an off-the-wall idea he had for 1983s Return of the Jedi regarding the identity of infamous Star Wars bounty hunter Boba Fett: He thought Fett should be Lukes mother.

What is as clockwork as the killings themselves was the attempt to obfuscate the details in order to relieve the officers of responsibility.\n\nIt is troubling that stories like Roberson\u2019s are par for the course, commonplace incidents. White society, generally believing itself to be innocent or off the hook in race conversations, has developed strategies and defense mechanisms to keep itself from reckoning with the constant terror against our lives.\n\nWhen even a more progressive white person is challenged about systemic or individual racism, the commonplace response is usually to capsize into fragility, protecting the intentions of white people over the impact on people of color.\n\nWe have yet to find the limit of mistreatment and violence that will cause the country at large to collectively acknowledge the value of our lives.\n\nWhat has become clear in this shooting and every other shooting since the initiation of the movement in 2013 is that no amount of death changes the collective (majority white) view of black people as disposable objects. Over the years of this civil rights movement, we have yet to find the level of mistreatment and violence that will cause white people, law enforcement and the country at large to collectively acknowledge the value of our lives.\n\nPeople of color and white folks have almost entirely divergent ideas about how race and racism play out. A quick look at the voting trends from the midterm elections solidifies the gap in political priorities. People of color, seeing and calling out patterns of racial violence, particularly over the last five years, are refining a sense of the systemic and institutional nature of oppression. In contrast, many white people remain confident that racism is an unfortunate psychological disposition or antiquated ideological bias, something from the past that doesn\u2019t affect any of us now.\n\nEvery day, white people see themselves as free of prejudice while simultaneously supporting and benefiting from systems that negatively impact people of color. If one isn\u2019t explicitly racist, it is not racism, with white people continuing to value their intentions or feelings over the lived experiences of people of color. The constant stream of explicitly racist violence against black bodies sheds a light on how wrong they are about modern race relations, but they refuse to see it or else they respond callously and call it compassion.\n\nKarl Marx said \u201creligion is the opiate of the people,\u201d but in 21st-century U.S. culture, compassion fatigue is. The violence against black people, particularly in the form of police brutality, has become so commonplace that not only are activists losing the capacity to resist well but it seems even the most liberal of white Americans are losing the ability to care. After black people die or are systematically killed and their killers acquitted, people post \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d sentiments and seem down for the cause, as though their platitudes can actually create social change.\n\nThe frequency of violence and the failure of the justice system to show up on behalf of black people create the context for this normalization and subsequent hopelessness.\n\nBlack lives mattering to black people is important but it is only one part of the journey toward liberation and equality.\n\nEven with the murder of Botham Jean, the Dallas Police Department has turned the case into an issue of police being overworked rather than holding the officer accountable. White people in positions of power feel forced to defend themselves and sacred institutions (church, police state, military, etc.) instead of seeing the flawed systems. They take criticism individualistically and defensively, and they watch each case as though it is one of experience rather than a pattern of learned racial bias and terror.\n\nCouching conversations about black lives in white \u201cvictimhood\u201d means that even when white people do atrocious things, as in the case of Jean or even \u201cCornerstore Caroline,\u201d the response can often equate to \u201cwhy ruin someone\u2019s life over an honest mistake?\u201d when the question ought to be \u201chow can we bring an end to racialized practices that create this precedent and situation in the first place?\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day, in this landscape, to be black is to live in a constant state of trauma and oppression. No one has to say that black lives do not matter for systems (and many individuals) to demonize and end our lives. We simply have to normalize the culture of violence around us, stay silent in the midst of others\u2019 oppression, and assume the innocence of whiteness at all costs.\n\nFor white people, believing and living as though black lives matter requires being moved with empathy toward action that interrupts internalized, institutional and interpersonal manifestations of racism. It requires getting educated, naming double standards, checking gut-level defensiveness and moving through fragility into activism alongside people of color who have lost our lives in movement after movement so that you would care enough to change and check some of your privilege at the door or voting booth.\n\nSince the onset of the Black Lives Matter movement, white supremacy has found more subversive ways of perpetuating violence and oppression against black bodies \u2015 and it is not limited to events like the white nationalist march in Charlottesville or explicitly racialized language and incidents.\n\nBlack lives mattering to black people is important but it is only one part of the journey toward liberation and equality. Black lives have to matter to white people in order to see systemic change and an end to white supremacy."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Andy McDonald", "title": "Barack Obama Makes Surprise Appearance During Michelle\u2019s Book Tour", "description": "The former president compared his cameo to Jay-Z coming on stage during a Beyonc\u00e9 concert.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-michelle-obama-book-tour_us_5bf1c63be4b07573881f833b", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf1d0af200000570602943f.png?cache=p3MUAQxcWb&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T22:06:47Z", "content": "Barack Obama made a cameo during Michelle Obama \u2019s book tour stop in Washington, D.C., Saturday night.

But unlike attorneys general, special counsels do not require Senate confirmation, according to legal experts.\n\nCiting the appointments clause in Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution, Alan B.

Nelson conceded to Scott in a phone call Sunday afternoon.\n\nScott, 65, joins Marco Rubio in January to give the state two Republican senators for the first time since Reconstruction.\n\nScott\u2019s win \u2015 anticipated since the final provisional ballots were counted last week and the margin remained over 12,000 \u2015 means Republicans were successful in ousting Democratic senators in four states carried by President Donald Trump in 2016: Claire McCaskill in Missouri, Joe Donnelly in Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and Nelson in Florida.\n\nBut the GOP failed to beat Sherrod Brown in Ohio, Joe Manchin in West Virginia, Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, Debbie Stabenow in Michigan and Jon Tester in Montana \u2015 Democrats from six other states that Trump carried in 2016 whom he repeatedly campaigned against.\n\nFurther, Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen defeated incumbent Republican Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada, and Republicans lost the seat held by Jeff Flake, who retired, to Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, giving Democrats two pickups. The result is a net gain of just two seats for Republicans despite the most promising Senate map for them in decades.\n\nNelson, 76, has been in the Senate 18 years following six years as the state\u2019s insurance commissioner and, before that, 12 years in the House as a congressman from the Space Coast.\n\nScott is wrapping up his second term as Florida\u2019s chief executive and could not seek a third because of term limits. Scott\u2019s two previous election victories for governor had also been squeakers \u2015 1.1 percentage points each time.\n\nHis win means Florida has thrice elected to statewide office the man who, in the 1990s, ran a for-profit hospital chain that agreed to pay $1.7 billion in fines for systematically defrauding Medicare, Medicaid and veterans\u2019 health programs. Scott invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate oneself 75 times during a deposition in a related civil trial about his role in the fraud committed by Columbia/HCA.\n\nDuring Scott\u2019s first run for governor in 2010, both his Republican opponent in the primary and Democratic nominee Alex Sink used that history in negative ads against him. But Scott was willing to spend freely from his personal fortune of hundreds of millions of dollars and managed to eke out narrow wins against both.\n\nIn 2014, Scott barely won re-election against Charlie Crist, who had been the Republican governor before Scott but later became a Democrat.\n\nIn fact, Scott\u2019s popularity only broke 50 percent on a consistent basis in 2017, after his generally well-regarded handling of Hurricane Irma. That improvement in his polling numbers, in addition to his continued willingness to spend heavily on his own campaigns, made national Republicans believe that Scott had a good chance of defeating Nelson, whose two previous re-elections had been against weak opponents.\n\nAll that, though, was before this summer, when red tide worsened along the southwest coast of Florida and blooms of thick, blue-green algae from Lake Okeechobee began choking Fort Myers on the Gulf of Mexico and Stuart on the Atlantic Ocean. When the freshwater algae hit saltwater at the coast, they die, releasing toxins into the water and air \u2015 and, scientists believe, providing additional food for the naturally occurring red tide bacteria. The result has been millions of dead fish, sea turtles, dolphins and manatees, with their carcasses washing up on beaches and adding to the already-acrid stench of red tide toxins.\n\nMany environmentalists blamed Scott for the calamity. He had slashed budgets for the agencies responsible for safeguarding the water quality in Lake Okeechobee and eased enforcement efforts against polluters.\n\nScott faced protests late this summer at campaign stops in Fort Myers and Venice \u2015 both Republican strongholds. He largely refrained from coastal campaign visits as the red tide spread up Florida\u2019s eastern coast, and then he stopped campaigning altogether after Hurricane Michael struck the Panhandle in early October.\n\nHowever, Scott had the advantage of running for the Senate as a sitting governor. Governors of a state are well known to voters and are able to take credit for day-to-day accomplishments, while senators have nowhere near that level of visibility. The last incumbent senator to lose an election in Florida, in fact, was also defeated by a sitting governor: Democratic Gov. Bob Graham ousted Republican Sen. Paula Hawkins in 1986.\n\nIn the end, the advantage of that bully pulpit combined with the tens of millions of Scott\u2019s own dollars he put into his race was enough to win.\n\nThis story has been updated to include the final vote tally."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Bill Bradley", "title": "Here\u2019s Why Realistic Pokemon Are Creeping People Out", "description": "Pokemon go... far, far away, please.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/realistic-pokemon-from-detective-pikachu-are-creeping-people-out_us_5beb41e1e4b0caeec2bef1ff", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5beb77e01d000085003131b8.png?cache=DorOdhPWYC&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T19:18:13Z", "content": "The \u201c Detective Pikachu \u201d trailer is out, and it\u2019s terrifying!

Here are a few reasons realistic Pok\u00e9mon feel like waking nightmares:\n\nThe uncanny valley.\n\nOne of the most compelling theories speculated on offered by psychologists and designers alike is: We\u2019re in \u201cuncanny valley\u201d territory.\n\nThe term \u201cuncanny\u201d has roots in an essay by Sigmund Freud in 1919 called \u201cDas Unheimliche,\u201d explained Ken Goldberg, a professor and department chair of industrial engineering and operations research at University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\u201cThis idea of the uncanny has a lot of interesting resonance in a lot of classic gothic literature and a lot of art, and it\u2019s used by artists through history,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s where you have something that is normally familiar and then it becomes deeply unfamiliar.\u201d\n\nGoldberg said the term \u201cuncanny valley\u201d came about in 1970 when roboticist Masahiro Mori made a conceptual discovery while looking into how people react to prosthetics. The \u201cmore humanlike\u201d artificial limbs got, Goldberg said, the \u201cmore comfortable up to a point\u201d people were around them.\n\n\u201cAnd then there\u2019s this big dip.\u201d\n\nThe thing was, even though the robotic work so closely resembled human limbs, they weren\u2019t absolutely convincing as human limbs. And that made people feel, well, weird. Think of a classic creep-fest like \u201cPolar Express.\u201d The closer a character in the animated movie appears to a human, the more you feel like Tom Hanks wants to murder you.\n\n\u201cWhen people start talking about using the term creepy, it\u2019s a good signal,\u201d Goldberg said of the critics bemoaning the too-real Pok\u00e9mon appearances. \u201cBecause creepy is the closest thing we have to the emotion of the uncanny, that Freud talked about. We don\u2019t have a word for it in English, but creepy is pretty close. So it could be called the creepy valley, right?\u201d\n\nThe uncanny valley isn\u2019t a perfect theory to explain the eeriness of the CGI Pok\u00e9mon, though.\n\nPeter Lunenfeld, a professor and vice chair in the design and media arts department at UCLA, told me it\u2019s \u201ca little bit odd\u201d that people are bringing up the uncanny valley to describe how they feel about the Pok\u00e9mon, because the concept applies to images that are \u201ctrying to approach a human\u201d and Pok\u00e9mon were never real.\n\nIn this case, he said, the term \u201cuncanny valley\u201d isn\u2019t being used as its definition intended. Rather, it\u2019s acting like a meme.\n\n\u201cYou can identify the uncanny valley now as a meme. It\u2019s not something that has that much relationship to the scientific or academic literature, but they want to invoke why it feels creepy to them,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Lunenfeld, there are different ways into the uncanny valley.\n\n\u201cWalt Disney approaches the uncanny valley from the classic route, which is with the Hall of Presidents and animatronics, whereas somebody like Hugh Hefner approaches the uncanny valley in the opposite direction, where he takes real people, i.e. playmates, and turns them into denizens of the uncanny valley,\u201d he said, reiterating an idea he\u2019d outlined in the essay \u201cThe Factory Model of Desire.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is yet another route to the uncanny valley, where 8-bit characters turn into illustrations on cards who then turn into anime who were then turned into various [3-D generations] of gaming,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe question is, \u2018Why when you get to this moment, literally 30 years after the first thought of [Pok\u00e9mon]\u2026 why is it that this iteration in this particular narrative space breeds this online discussion?\u2019\u201d\n\nPart of the discussion hinges on a character that perhaps better fits the traditional definition of the uncanny valley: Mr. Mime, a humanoid demon-clown-jester-looking Pok\u00e9mon. Of all the characters in the trailer, Mr. Mime is probably the creepiest, and Goldberg explained why.\n\n\u201cThis particular guy... he does look a little like an evil clown and has got this fleshiness to him,\u201d he said. \u201cThe little hairs on his head are particularly troubling people, and that is often a sign. This little bit of realism that goes to far.\u201d\n\nWarner Bros. Mr. Mime, please leave me alone forever.\n\nElizabeth Jochum, an associate professor in art practice and robotics at Aalborg University in Denmark, agreed.\n\n\u201cI think that has to do with the creepy human factor where it\u2019s somewhere in between. We don\u2019t know where to put it. It\u2019s not quite animated, and it\u2019s not quite fantastical, and it\u2019s not quite human,\u201d she said. \u201cThe other thing is we\u2019re trying to understand what it says, but we don\u2019t really understand it.\u201d\n\nWe also went to someone who\u2019s studied what actually makes things creepy, Frank McAndrew, a professor of psychology at Knox College in Illinois. He admitted that Mr. Mime\u2019s face is working against him.\n\n\u201cThe eyes in particular, with the eyebrows going up \u2015 very expressive, very human-looking,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no nose and no lips and no teeth, so once again you\u2019ve got this [conflict]... if you just were to focus on the eyes and the eyebrows you would think it actually is a human being, but then it\u2019s embedded in this other thing where you don\u2019t even know what it is. Think of it as a cognitive tension.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know we don\u2019t like uncertainty,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe want to be able to categorize these things, so we look at something like this and we struggle. Because what the hell is it is it supposed to be? A person? Is it supposed to be something else? We don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nExpectations.\n\nJochum provided us with a few other thoughts on the Pok\u00e9mon heebie-jeebies.\n\n\u201cI found it uncanny for another reason, which had to do with the voice \u2015 which completely did not mix at all with the Pikachu design or with previous kinds of iterations of Pikachu that we know from film or the Japanese anime. In that regard, I think the uncanny is triggered by this dissonance between this cute little animated character and the voice of this middle aged man.\u201d\n\nAgain, Pikachu is voiced by Ryan Reynolds, age 42.\n\nLike the shock of hearing a deep voice come out of a yellow electrified rodent, some of our creeped-out-ness has to do with plain ol\u2019 expectations.\n\nHere\u2019s Jigglypuff from the animation:\n\nHere\u2019s Jigglypuff in the movie:\n\nA lot of the experts we talked with didn\u2019t find the Pok\u00e9mon all that particularly disturbing.\n\n\u201cI gotta say, in the universe of creepy things, I think Pok\u00e9mon are pretty far down the list,\u201d McAndrew said.\n\nBut that\u2019s because he didn\u2019t have a history with them.\n\n\u2033Uncanny literary means \u2018unfamiliar\u2019 \u2015 and is provoked when we are met with something that should be familiar to us but we experience as unfamiliar,\u201d Jochum said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s not about nostalgia, per se, but about the dissonance or discomfort we experience when we encounter something we think we know, but doesn\u2019t match up to our expectations.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the uncanny valley so much, or even the unheimlich (the Germans have the best words for being creeped out),\u201d Lunenfeld said, \u201cas the unhappiness a subset of the Pok\u00e9mon \u2018community\u2019 feels with this 3D-motion-capture-CGI-furred-celebrity-actor-voiced Pikachu. This unhappiness is driven by a mixture of nostalgia and unfulfilled desire.

The uncanny really is a physical response, and it is connected to our fight or flight mechanism. Is it friendly? Can I eat it? Is it going to eat me? Our brain makes very quick decisions about these things, and if we can\u2019t immediately recognize if it\u2019s friend or foe, human or non-human, then we have trouble with it and we stay on our guard.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Igor Bobic", "title": "Bucking McConnell, Sens.

(AP) \u2014 Florida is suing the nation\u2019s two largest drugstore chains, Walgreens and CVS, alleging they added to the state and national opioid crisis by overselling painkillers and not taking precautions to stop illegal sales.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi announced late Friday that she has added the companies to a state-court lawsuit filed last spring against Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, and several opioid distributors.\n\nBondi said in a press release that CVS and Walgreens \u201cplayed a role in creating the opioid crisis.\u201d She said the companies failed to stop \u201csuspicious orders of opioids\u201d and \u201cdispensed unreasonable quantities of opioids from their pharmacies.\u201d On average, about 45 people die nationally each day because of opioid overdoses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS A lawsuit filed by the state of Florida accuses Walgreens and CVS of fueling the opioid crisis.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to pursue those companies that played a role in creating the opioid crisis,\u201d said Bondi, who has been mentioned as a possible replacement by President Donald Trump for recently ousted U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \u201cThousands of Floridians have suffered as a result of the actions of the defendants.\u201d\n\nCVS spokesman Mike DeAngelis called the lawsuit \u201cwithout merit\u201d in a statement Saturday. He said the company trains its pharmacists and their assistants about their responsibilities when dispensing controlled substances and gives them tools to detect potentially illegal sales.\n\n\u201cOver the past several years, CVS has taken numerous actions to strengthen our existing safeguards to help address the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic,\u201d DeAngelis said.\n\nWalgreens said Saturday it doesn\u2019t comment on pending lawsuits.\n\nRobert Alexander via Getty Images CVS and Walgreens are accused of having \u201cplayed a role in creating the opioid crisis.\u201d\n\nUntil a law enforcement crackdown at the beginning of the decade, Florida was known for its so-called pain mills. Drug dealers from throughout the country would send associates to store-front clinics where unscrupulous doctors would write opioid prescriptions for bogus injuries and illnesses. At one point, 90 of the nation\u2019s top 100 opioid prescribers were Florida doctors, according to federal officials.\n\nAfter receiving the prescriptions, the phony patients would buy the pills from Florida pharmacies \u2014 state law says pharmacists must refuse to fill prescriptions they suspect are not for a valid purpose. Most of the opioids would then be taken out of state to be resold illegally at huge markups, creating a drug crisis in many communities throughout the Eastern United States.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Walgreens has dispensed billions of opioid dosages from its Florida pharmacies since 2006. The Illinois-based chain is the nation\u2019s largest drugstore chain and has more than 13,200 stores globally.\n\nThe company distributed 2.2 million opioid tablets from its store in Hudson, a Tampa-area town of 12,000, and in one unidentified town of 3,000, sold 285,000 pills in a month, the lawsuit says. In some stores, its opioid sales jumped six-fold in two years. The company paid $80 million five years ago to resolve a federal investigation that centered on inadequate record keeping of its Florida opioid sales that allowed the pills to reach the black market."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "David Barden", "title": "Camp Fire Death Toll Climbs To 76 As Missing Person List Swells To Almost 1,300", "description": "Butte County Sheriff-Coroner Kory L.

Bernie Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential bid.\n\n\u201cLong story short, I need you to run for office,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez began her remarks. \u201cWe all need to run at all levels of government, but I really hope that many of you join me here in Congress.\u201d\n\nJustice Democrats recruited Ocasio-Cortez to run and played a key role in her upset of Rep. Joe Crowley, a House power-broker, in New York\u2019s Democratic primary in June. Ocasio-Cortez then easily won the seat Crowley has held since 1999 in this month\u2019s general election.\n\nThe group is calling its new campaign #OurTime. The initiative asks Justice Democrats\u2019 army of activists to help identify Democratic House incumbents who are \u201cdemographically and ideologically out-of-touch with their districts,\u201d and identify people who might make good primary challengers to them.\n\nJoining Ocasio-Cortez in backing the #OurTime initiative is Rep.-elect Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.).\n\nJustice Democrats\u2019 inclusion of demographic criteria likely means that even some reliably progressive white Democrats who represent more diverse districts won\u2019t be safe from such challenges in 2020. The group already showcased that approach with its support for Ayanna Pressley, a black Boston city council member who unseated progressive Rep. Michael Capuano (D-Mass.) in a primary in September.\n\nIf I made people mad, they could have put me on the dog-walking committee or whatever. They still might. Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.)\n\nOcasio-Cortez and leaders of Justice Democrats say they are driven by a conviction that most current Democratic members of Congress are not up to the task of enacting the radical solutions to address the country\u2019s \u2015 and the planet\u2019s \u2015 most pressing problems. The most urgent of those crises, they said, include climate change, widening economic inequality and persistent racial injustice.\n\n\u201cThere are some good people who want to push for stuff, but they don\u2019t have the backup right now to do anything big,\u201d said Saikat Chakrabarti, a founder of Justice Democrats who is headed to Washington to serve as Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cSo we need new leaders, period. We\u2019ve got to primary folks.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have folks who are mission-focused, and laser-focused on solving these gigantic problems, we just aren\u2019t going to get them solved in time,\u201d he added.\n\nIt is highly unusual for a member of Congress to support a massive number of primary challenges targeting party colleagues.\n\nBut over the course of last week\u2019s orientation on Capitol Hill for newly elected lawmakers, Ocasio-Cortez demonstrated she has little interest in adhering to traditional congressional norms of comity and deference.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez attended the Sunrise Movement\u2019s sit-in at the office of House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and endorsed the group\u2019s call for a select committee to address climate change that is comprised solely of members of Congress who have not received fossil fuel industry money. The committee envisioned by Ocasio-Cortez and the group would be charged with drafting a Marshall Plan-style \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d to have the U.S. powered entirely by renewable energy by 2035.\n\nThe committee idea has gained support from a handful of sitting House Democrats and newly elected ones. But the proposal and Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s support for it also elicited some public opposition from veteran Democratic colleagues, many of whom have senior committee posts and claim that a new panel is unnecessary.\n\nThe investigative news site Sludge subsequently reported that each of the Democrats quoted as criticizing Ocasio-Cortez had received massive donations during the 2018 campaign cycle from fossil-fuel industry and electric utility political action committees and employees.\n\nTo Ocasio-Cortez, the negative response to the idea of simply creating a committee tasked with drafting legislation only strengthens the case for more primary challenges to veteran incumbents.\n\nThe resistance to the proposal \u201cpoints to the role that fossil-fuel industry contributions play even within the Democratic Party,\u201d she said.\n\nIn another sign of her independence, Ocasio-Cortez has not yet joined the leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus \u2015 which she is joining \u2015 in endorsing Pelosi\u2019s bid for House speaker. That gives Ocasio-Cortez some leverage in the bid to persuade Pelosi to establish the climate-change committee.\n\nThe 29-year-old democratic socialist said she is aware she may already face political punishment for her participation in the sit-in at Pelosi\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cIf I made people mad, they could have put me on the dog-walking committee or whatever. They still might. But I knew that it was worth it,\u201d she said.\n\nIn her remarks to the Justice Democrats, Ocasio-Cortez invited activists considering running for office to take a similar leap in the faith that history would be on their side.\n\n\u201cKnow that they will come after you and that that\u2019s OK because at the end of the day, when you are on the right side of that long arc of history that bends toward justice, we will be able to tell our grandchildren that we fought for what\u2019s right,\u201d she said."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "AP", "title": "California Fire Claims More Lives As Death Toll Rises To 76", "description": "The remains of more people were found Saturday in the decimated town of Paradise and in nearby Concow.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/death-toll-california-fire-2018_us_5bf19024e4b0b84243e32d7e", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf190e21f00000406263775.jpeg?cache=cklho4evr2&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T16:41:31Z", "content": "By SUDHIN THANAWALA and TERENCE CHEA, Associated Press CHICO, Calif.

He also visited Southern California, where firefighters were making progress on a wildfire that tore through communities west of Los Angeles from Thousand Oaks to Malibu, killing three people.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like this in California, we\u2019ve never seen anything like this yet. It\u2019s like total devastation,\u201d Trump said as he stood amid the ruins of Paradise and pledged the full support of the federal government. The president initially blamed state officials for poor forest management in exacerbating the fires and threatened to cut off federal funding.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got our back,\u201d outgoing Gov. Jerry Brown said on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation Sunday. \u201cThere have been some back and forth between California leaders and the president.

Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) won her Midwest district by more than 20 points, even though it's a Trump stronghold. That's a pretty good skill to have for someone running to lead the DCCC.\n\nBut women may not end up with much of a voice in congressional leadership if House Democrats aren\u2019t careful \u2015 a scenario that would come across as both tone-deaf and absurd in the wake of this month\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nThere are eight House Democratic leadership races and, barring something dramatic, the top three posts are already accounted for: Rep. Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) is likely the next speaker, Rep. Steny Hoyer (Md.) is likely the next majority leader and Rep. Jim Clyburn (S.C.) is likely the next majority whip. That trifecta has remained in place for years.\n\nIt\u2019s the next tier of races where women have a real chance at joining leadership, but they are at risk of being pushed out by more influential male colleagues.\n\nThe race for the fourth highest post, assistant Democratic leader, is between two men, Reps. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n (N.M.) and David Cicilline (R.I.). Rep. Cheri Bustos (Ill.) had previously spent weeks laying the groundwork to run for the seat. But right after the midterms, Luj\u00e1n, a top Pelosi ally and chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, jumped into the race and effectively forced her out.\n\nBustos, who is DCCC\u2019s chair of heartland engagement and who just won her Midwest district by 24 points despite it being a Donald Trump stronghold, announced a new bid last week to lead the DCCC. Reps. Denny Heck (Wash.), who led DCCC\u2019s recruitment effort, and Suzan DelBene (Wash.), who is vice chair of the New Democrat Coalition, were already in the race. A day after Bustos announced, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (N.Y.) got in, too.\n\nRep. Barbara Lee (Calif.), a longtime progressive leader, spent weeks building support for her bid for the fifth highest post, chair of the Democratic Caucus. But after the midterms, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), who has been floated as a potential future speaker, jumped into the race. Similarly, after Rep. Katherine Clark (Mass.) spent months wooing supporters in her bid for Democratic Caucus vice chair, Rep. Pete Aguilar (Calif.), who is the whip in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, got into the race.\n\nThat leaves one more race, for co-chairs of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee. There are three seats open and five contenders. Just one, Rep. Debbie Dingell (Mich.), is a woman.\n\nTo be clear, anyone can run for any of these leadership posts. There\u2019s nothing wrong with male lawmakers throwing their hats into races. The problem, if men sweep these seats, is the collective message that Democrats would be sending: that men deserve to hold the highest ranks in the party, even after women just won the House back for them. For the first time in U.S. history, more than 100 women have been elected to the House, and of the 37 seats that Democrats flipped, female candidates won 23.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) is running to lead the House Democratic Caucus. She said there's never been an African-American woman elected to leadership.\n\nThat sentiment isn\u2019t lost on some of the congresswomen eager to join leadership and shape the party\u2019s agenda heading into the 2020 elections.\n\n\u201cI do think in the so-called \u2018year of the woman,\u2019 we as a caucus need to show Democrats across the country that we value women in top leadership roles,\u201d Bustos said. \u201cI think I\u2019m the right person at the right time... The path to the majority went through the heartland and went through my gender.\u201d\n\nIf Bustos wins her DCCC bid, she would be just the second woman to chair the group since its formation in 1866. Rep. Nita Lowey (N.Y.) led the DCCC 15 years ago.\n\n\u201cWe need to have diversity in our leadership,\u201d Bustos said. \u201cHow this turns out at the end of the month is very, very important in terms of what we show the American public.\u201d\n\nLee, who is African-American, said she\u2019s running to lead the Democratic Caucus because she has the experience and background as a 20-year congresswoman. She emphasized that it\u2019s time for more diversity at the top, noting that her caucus has never elected an African-American woman to leadership.\n\n\u201cThat would be a big problem,\u201d Lee said of the prospect of men filling up leadership roles in the new Congress. \u201cThe Democratic Caucus has a chance to make that not happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running for vice chair to ensure that every member has a voice in shaping our agenda,\u201d Clark said. \u201cAnd that certainly includes the perspective of the record number of women in our caucus.\u201d\n\nHow this turns out at the end of the month is very, very important in terms of what we show the American public.

The final decision rests with leadership: the speaker, likely Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), and a handful of figures like Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), who will chair the powerful House Rules Committee and who publicly supports greater debate over the arms trade.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive branch is already required to inform key congressional committees of any major weapons sale 30 days before U.S. and foreign officials finalize terms. Capitol Hill can use legislation to block the deal within that period. Such a bill, even if successful, would likely be vetoed by the president and then might not win over a veto-proof majority of lawmakers \u2015 but the general consensus is that simply initiating such a spectacle makes it harder for a sale to continue and creates pressure for it to be abandoned instead. If there\u2019s no bill, the process automatically moves forward.\n\nWhat some House members and outside groups skeptical of the defense industry want to fix is a discrepancy between the two chambers. In the Senate, any member can force the full body to vote on legislation disapproving of a sale 10 days after a notification comes to Congress if the foreign relations committee has not acted on it. Democrats have used that power repeatedly in dramatic votes over U.S. weapons shipments for a controversial Saudi military campaign in Yemen, and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has deployed it to force debates that draw attention to his libertarian views on foreign policy.\n\nBut in the House, members who introduce similar bills could see them get referred to the foreign affairs committee and then simply never make it to a full floor vote. Critics of the arms trade say this lets lawmakers avoid accountability for deals that can allow weapons buyers to commit war crimes, and that allow the defense industry to reap huge profits off research largely funded by the U.S. taxpayer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m for any more oversight we can add to this process to make sure that the American people\u2019s interests are being represented,\u201d said Dan Grazier of the Project on Government Oversight, which endorsed a September proposal from McGovern and Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) that would recreate the Senate procedure in the House. Such a bill has almost no chance of becoming law under Trump and the GOP-controlled Senate, but it signaled a desire among Democrats that party leaders can act on by enshrining, in their rules for the new House session, the right of any member to demand a floor debate on an arms deal.\n\nOpposition to arms sales is generally seen as a human rights issue, but Grazier pointed to another concern he wants to see raised if there are more debates over such deals: the waivers often involved that effectively mean the trade is subsidized by U.S. taxpayers.\n\nThe development and production of American weapons technology by huge firms like Lockheed Martin and Boeing involves massive support paid for by the U.S. government in the form of testing and research assistance. That\u2019s seen as justified since the government is ultimately the top customer for those companies. Foreign buyers, however, are legally mandated to pay those costs back \u2015 unless the State and Defense departments agree to provide waivers for those costs by saying that forcing a payment would threaten foreign alliances or the specific deal. Over the last five years, such waivers have cost the U.S. close to $16 billion, according to the Government Accountability Office, while private companies and other governments have been able to protect their bottom lines.\n\nMore discussion of the arms trade could also involve more honest conversations about whether it really creates jobs the way Trump says. Experts like William Hartung of the Center for International Policy are doubtful, citing the requirements in many deals to produce in foreign countries and the likelihood that workers in the industry could be more productive in other fields.\n\nAnd without the risk of bills questioning arms sales getting trapped in the foreign affairs committee, where members are particularly susceptible to administration arguments about diplomatic caution and especially deluged with foreign lobbying, activists believe they would gain an advantage.\n\nProponents of the change know it is no panacea, and indeed not even a certainty. Democratic leaders could still turn against it for any number of reasons. The aide mentioned that some veteran lawmakers are wary of allowing any member of the 435-person House to take the step, worried that it could disrupt order when other urgent issues need to be tackled.\n\nDefense lobbyists and those working for other governments are also likely to fight the potential change tooth and nail, focusing on blocking the proposal from becoming reality and working with allies in the Pentagon and the White House. They likely see an opportunity in the fact that some of the most high-profile new Democratic lawmakers who have gained respect for having flipped seats have backgrounds in national security and may be especially willing to talk about maintaining U.S. dominance in the international weapons business.\n\nMeanwhile, the policy wouldn\u2019t hinder other hawkish moves by Trump, like providing intelligence support for the Saudis in Yemen or ratcheting up tension with Iran.\n\nBut advocates are generally hopeful, citing the many ways Democrats can now expand their influence over war and peace. Just last week, Republicans made continuing the U.S. military role in Yemen their first priority of the lame duck session, handily defeating a Democrat-backed bill. That\u2019s the kind of action that will now, presumably, be a thing of the past."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Mary Papenfuss", "title": "Bad To The Bone: Ruth Bader Ginsburg Gets Down In Epic 'SNL' Rap Video", "description": "\"Tell Trump to stay outta her way.

Porter, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, is a progressive who supports single-payer with the backing of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).

Ed Royce, who did not seek re-election. Republicans invested millions behind Kim, a rising star who would have been the first Korean-American woman representative in Congress had she won. She held an early lead of several thousand votes on Election Day, but it evaporated as outstanding ballots continued to be counted there.\n\nDemocrats also succeeded in flipping districts carried by Rep.

In the state\u2019s 48th congressional district, for example, wealthy real estate executive Harley Rouda defeated Rohrabacher by campaigning on progressive issues like Medicare for all, tuition-free college, and a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage.\n\nThe Democratic sweep may have been foreshadowed by the retirements of longtime Republican stalwarts like Issa and Royce last year, but it took local GOP officials by surprise.

White women split their vote between candidates from Trump\u2019s Republican party and their Democratic challengers, according to exit poll data. But in three key races, white women went for Republican candidates, leading to calls on social media for white women to do better.\n\n\n\nHuffPost\u2019s Emma Gray spoke about the role of white women in the election with Corinne McConnaughy, a political science professor whose work focuses on the roles gender and race play in American politics.\n\nEmma found that while white women have long been some of the most ardent defenders of what she calls the \u201cwhite patriarchy,\u201d as a whole they\u2019re actually an incredibly fractured group. \u201cCorinne\u2019s research suggests that [it isn\u2019t] a meaningful social group at all,\u201d she explained.\n\nShe also found that progressive white women who want to \u201ccall other white women in\u201d should begin in the communities they have social ties to and focus their efforts on recruiting sympathetic, but not necessarily politically active, white men to their cause.\n\n\n\nEmma\u2019s interview with McConnaugh is a fascinating read for anyone who has scratched their head over the support of white women for candidates like Donald Trump in the U.S. or Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, despite both men\u2019s record of misogynist comments and support of policies that threaten rights and protections for women and minorities.\n\n\n\nUntil next time,\n\n\n\nEmily\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS A motorist and a woman walks past a building that formerly was the Flipkart headquarters in Bangalore, India, Wednesday, May 9, 2018.
