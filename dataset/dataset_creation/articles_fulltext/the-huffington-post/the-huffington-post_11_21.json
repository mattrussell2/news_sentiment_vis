He won in a district that Donald Trump carried decisively in 2016, one that had not sent a Democrat to Congress in 10 years.\n\nHow this happened is instructive.\n\nRose was not particularly telegenic or charismatic. But he told his conservative constituents they were getting screwed. They already knew that, but he told them why.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t because of Mexicans or immigrants. It was, he said, because the economic system is rigged to benefit special corporate interests and the extremely wealthy. He told them that because of government policies, they were getting the short end of the stick, and that what is needed is better infrastructure and stronger unions.\n\nHe talked about what mattered to them: oppressively long commute times and the opioid crisis, which is destroying lives on Staten Island. And he criticized the incumbent congressman for taking money from the company that manufactures OxyContin.\n\nRose didn\u2019t lecture people, or shame them, or tell them not to be bigots or hostile to immigrants. Rather, like Franklin Roosevelt in the \u201930s, he focused on their local problems, and proposed real solutions.\n\nAnd they responded, in a way that astonished most New York liberals, who had long seen Staten Island politically as their local version of rural Alabama.\n\nBut there was something else at work too. Rose\u2019s arguments probably wouldn\u2019t have been enough to get him elected five years ago. The additional factor now is demographic change: new people with different politics, driven by affordable housing no longer available in Manhattan or Brooklyn, who had moved to Staten Island.\n\nThat phenomenon \u2015 demographic change \u2015 also drove electoral developments in Texas and Georgia. What we have now in this country is the political struggle reflected by these changes. The story everywhere on Nov. 6 was of growing, college-educated, ethnically diverse populations in expanding urban and suburban areas versus declining, rural, nearly uniformly white populations with no more than high school education and limited, fading economic opportunities.\n\nThe latter, used to being in the majority, voted like their lives depended on it, because of their dread that they are facing an inevitable process of being replaced by \u201cthe other.\u201d They have always been there, have felt that fear for a while, but now Trump has given voice and leadership to their fears, as he rails against the same things they dread.\n\nOf course, they are being pushed to the margins not by \u201cthe other,\u201d but by economic changes that are eliminating their jobs. Encouraging them not to dread what is engulfing them only increases their dread; that is why the blue politics of coastal \u201cprogressives\u201d only drives them closer to Trump, and why their support for him remains invariant, no matter what he says or does that outrages the rest of us.\n\nTheir fears are not imaginary. They are like the Luddites in England at the dawn of industrialization. The world is phasing them out, they know it, they feel powerless to stop it, and all the advocacy of people like us only exacerbates their fear and their despair.\n\nMichael B. Thomas via Getty Images Supporters celebrate Republican Josh Hawley's victory over Sen. Claire McCaskill (D) in Missouri.\n\nTrump has nothing remedial to offer them, of course, nothing to ease their plight. In fact, his policies make it worse. But he gives voice and legitimacy to their fears, their resentments and their frustration, which Democrats have long since stopped doing.\n\nJust as Hitler had no economic remedies to offer those in the Weimar Republic who had been ravaged by inflation and the punitive terms of the Treaty of Versailles, so Trump has nothing to offer his base economically. But just as Hitler identified with the simmering resentments of ordinary Germans, raged against their plight, devised scapegoats and promised to restore \u201cgreatness,\u201d so Trump has arisen to rage against the forces his base believes are closing in on and destroying them. He promises them restoration and they love him for that, even as he plunders them.\n\nWhen the marchers in Charlottesville, Virginia, chanted \u201cWe will not be replaced\u201d last summer, and when Trump responded by saying there were \u201cgood people on both sides,\u201d that was what was going on.\n\nMeanwhile, our side of the political divide mostly just sneers at Trump\u2019s voters and calls them racists. Many of them surely are racists, as were many who voted for FDR four times because he saved them economically.\n\nThis is a dangerous time, because the demographic and economic forces that are closing in on Trump\u2019s voters are what propelled him to power. But those same demographic forces are expanding the electoral power of our side. What happened in Staten Island \u2015 and in Georgia, and in Texas \u2015 is moving our way.\n\nTrump probably represents the political death rattle of those populations as they decline. But the politics of death rattles are treacherous, because in the short term they strengthen politically what is fading away economically and sociologically.\n\nScapegoating works, as it did in Germany in the 1930s; the politics of resentment works; demagoguery works. And in the absence of anyone on our side offering sympathy for the plight of these fading populations and policies that ameliorate their plight, they will remain vulnerable and responsive to scapegoating \u201cthe other\u201d and to the politics of hate and bigotry \u2015 in a word, to demagoguery.\n\nWhen that happens, someone will always arise to exploit it and use it like a ladder to climb to power. That someone was Hitler in Germany in the \u201930s. And that someone is Trump in America now. He is not Hitler, but he is as much the result, not the cause, of the political plague afflicting us.\n\nThe question now is how much the plague will destroy and how permanent the destruction will be before demography overtakes it.\n\nEthan Miller via Getty Images Steve Sisolak was elected governor of Nevada this month in one of several key state-level wins for Democrats.\n\nThe danger is too great to sit back and trust to demographic forces. A politics must arise that not only fiercely defends the principles and practices of liberty, democracy, equal rights and remedial justice, but also finds a way genuinely to be sympathetic to the plight of the obsolescent; to identify their real, not their imagined, enemies, as Max Rose seems to have done; and to offer policies that ameliorate what is happening to them and remedy what ails them.\n\nThis is possible, but not if the Democrats stay huddled in their blue bubbles, continuing along the misbegotten Clintonian path, or comforting themselves with the thought that they are more virtuous than those \u201cdeplorables.\u201d If we do stay in those bubbles, then this year\u2019s victory in the House will be wasted, ineffective and short-lived.\n\nFor now, as the results of the Nov. 6 election sink in, there is much to be encouraged about.\n\nMost importantly, Democrats took the House back. That was the single result we had to have, because the political consequences of the Republicans holding their majority in the House would have been disastrous. And it was not a narrow victory: Despite gerrymandering, Democrats have gained at least 38 seats and may end up with as many as 40, providing a comfortable margin.\n\nBut it is a victory that only buys time; what matters now is what we do with it. The Democrats have to do more than wreak vengeance on Trump. They must of course uncompromisingly resist his forays into authoritarianism and bigotry, but even that is not enough.\n\nThey must also identify the real problems facing us, including those facing many Trump voters, and propose coherent policies that will address those problems. They must not only oppose, not only resist; they must govern. Or at least offer a vision of what governing means.\n\nSecondly, Democrats took back seven governorships and hundreds of state legislative seats. This is where political change starts, where political careers begin, where election districts are drawn, voting rights determined, and elections supervised. This is what the Democrats, focused more on national politics, ignored for too long, and where the extreme right began organizing many decades ago. Even though Democrats narrowly lost the governorships in Florida and Georgia, the fact that black candidates came as razor-thin close as they did in those states is inspiring. But only if we take it as a beginning, something to build on, and not just as a moral victory.\n\nAnd Democrats did take the governorships in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, the three states that gave Trump his Electoral College victory. Scott Walker in Wisconsin and Kris Kobach in Kansas (!) went down, and in the wake of Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s remarkable run in Texas, there were many wins down-ballot.\n\nThese state-based victories are very significant \u2015 but again, only if we consider them a first step, and do not relax.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Andrew Gillum narrowly lost his race for the Florida governorship, but the state's referendum re-establishing voting rights for ex-felons may prove critical in the future.\n\nIn what may have been the most significant victory next to winning back the House, we won a referendum in Florida restoring voting rights to 1.4 million people who had been barred from voting because of prior felony convictions. Most of these people are black, and many of the convictions, probably the single largest category, were for nonviolent drug offenses, like possession.\n\nThis was no accident, because the use of criminal convictions, often for petty, nonviolent crimes, arose in the Deep South immediately after the 15th Amendment was passed to give former slaves the right to vote. The South\u2019s reaction \u2015 to use the criminal law and felon disenfranchisement to essentially nullify the 15th Amendment \u2015 spread throughout America and became traditional.\n\nAnd that tradition persisted, unique among Western democracies. By 2000, all but two states had such laws, and 30 percent of black males in the states of the former Confederacy were barred from voting as a result. In Florida, in 2000, hundreds of thousands of people were barred in an election that determined the presidency by 537 disputed votes.\n\nThe drug war, supported by Democrats as well as Republicans (fiercely supported by President Bill Clinton, for example, and by virtually all Democrats in Congress), accelerated this process. In 1968, before President Richard Nixon launched the drug war (almost certainly as a means to target and disenfranchise black people in the wake of the Voting Rights Act of 1965), there were only 200,000 people in federal and state prisons, combined, for all crimes. But by 2000, there were 2.4 million people behind bars, and the largest single category reflecting that increase was nonviolent drug offenses.\n\nOver 80 percent of those convicted for these offenses were black and Latino, although black and Latino people use drugs in no greater proportions than whites. As a result, over 6 million mostly nonwhite citizens were barred from voting. And although there has been significant progress in overturning or moderating those barriers in other states, the state of Florida, with its pivotal role in presidential elections, was not among them. Now it is.\n\nThose 1.4 million newly re-enfranchised voters will have to get organized, registered, and so on. They will have to turn out.\n\nThe re-enfranchisement reform is not self-executing. But even adding several hundred thousand voters, many of them black, to the Florida rolls could transform that state from a perennial red/blue toss-up to a reliably blue zone. Florida \u2015 and the Electoral College map \u2015 may never be the same. This amendment passing in Florida is one of the less discussed results of the 2018 midterms, but it could be the most significant in terms of national politics and the 2020 presidential election.\n\nSo there is, in my view, much to be encouraged about. But the Nov. 6 victories were only a small step, a way of forestalling disaster. There is much work still to be done.\n\nThe midterm results indicate the direction of that work: away from blue-bubble moralizing, away from centrist complicity; toward equal rights and remedial justice and toward a reborn focus on the economic problems shared by most Americans.\n\nIt may not sound possible to do both, to stand fast for equal rights and also for economic relief for all those who are suffering, but it is. Fifty years ago, Robert Kennedy appealed strongly and successfully to both constituencies. But no major national politician since has effectively emulated him. We need to get back to where he was heading, and go there.\n\nWe can do it. We must do it. It is morally the right thing to do, and it is the best political strategy. The results of the last election have given us the opportunity. We dare not squander it."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Carol Kuruvilla", "title": "Judge's Decision Dismissing Female Genital Mutilation Charges Sparks Concern", "description": "Activists are worried that a federal judge's decision to dismiss mutilation charges against Michigan doctor Jumana Nagarwala will send the wrong message.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/judges-decision-dismissing-fgm-charges-sparks-concern-among-activists_us_5bf57f02e4b03b230f9db168", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58efd38f2600004500c45974.jpeg?cache=UQyJ2N3HLC&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T22:09:30Z", "content": "A federal judge has dismissed key charges against a Michigan doctor accused by prosecutors of performing female genital mutilation (FGM) on young girls a decision that has prompted some concern among activists against the practice.

Tehrer told HuffPost that many in the Sahiyo community \u2015 particularly survivors of the practice \u2015 feel the judge\u2019s decision is \u201ca punch in the gut.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people are sort of in shock and disbelief,\u201d Tehrer said.\n\nWatch a Love Matters India video about khatna in the Dawoodi Bohra community below.\n\nThe primary concern among activists is that Bohras who support genital cutting will misinterpret the ruling as proof that the practice is permissible. But Tehrer said Friedman\u2019s ruling had to do with a jurisdictional and technical challenge, pointing out that in his opinion, the judge called the practice of genital cutting \u201cessentially a criminal assault.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implication is that he views this as a criminal activity, but a local criminal activity under state jurisdiction,\u201d Tehrer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important distinction, but the reality is that many people have been using it as proof that we can continue this. That\u2019s not at all what happened.\u201d\n\nThe government is reviewing Friedman\u2019s opinion, The Associated Press reports. Experts are expecting it to be appealed.\n\nThe Nagarwala case is believed to be the first brought under the federal law against FGM, 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 116. Only 27 states currently have laws criminalizing FGM.\n\nNagarwala, a former emergency room physician, was arrested in April 2017, after an FBI investigation uncovered that she allegedly removed clitoral skin from two 7-year-old girls. Prosecutors claimed the girls were brought from Minnesota to Livonia for the procedure.\n\nThe investigation eventually uncovered nine alleged victims of FGM.\n\nMichigan\u2019s law against FGM passed after Nagarwala\u2019s arrest and can\u2019t be used to retroactively charge the doctor or others involved in the case, the Detroit Free Press reports.\n\nShannon Smith, Nagarwala\u2019s lawyer, has maintained that the procedure the doctor performed does not qualify as FGM.\n\n\u201cDr. Nagarwala is just a wonderful human being. She was always known as a doctor with an excellent reputation,\u201d Smith told the Detroit Free Press after the ruling. \u201cThe whole community was shocked when this happened. She\u2019s always been known to be a stellar doctor, mother, person.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization defines FGM as procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. It is primarily a cultural tradition that is practiced by some members of the Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and other faiths, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nMost American Muslim denominations do not practice FGM. In fact, prominent Muslim organizations have openly condemned the practice. But for years, Dawoodi Bohras, a Mumbai-based sect of Shia Islam, have practiced a type of genital cutting called khatna, or khafz. Bohras have long considered khatna to be a religious requirement for women, even though it is rarely discussed by mosque leaders. The social pressure to have daughters undergo the procedure has been quietly passed down from woman to woman over generations.\n\nSupporters of khatna resist having their practice defined as FGM. But Tahrer said although the kind of genital cutting typically practiced by Bohras is not as extreme as other forms, it is still happening to young girls who are not able to give their consent.\n\nIn addition, calling khatna simply a \u201cnick\u201d or a \u201cwiping\u201d of the clitoral hood also dismisses the stories of many survivors who say they are still experiencing physical or emotional harm from the procedure, Tahrer said.\n\nThe WHO and The United Nations Population Fund consider genital cutting to be a human rights violation \u2015 no matter the severity of the particular procedure.\n\nCourtesy of Sahiyo Sahiyo cofounders in Mumbai India displaying an award the organization received for their work on female genital cutting.\n\nBoth Bohra men and women have spoken up against khatna in recent years. At the same time, since Nagarwala\u2019s arrest, some Dawoodi Bohra women have banded together to publicly defend the practice as harmless, and claim that governmental attempts to restrict it infringes on their religious freedom. Tahrer said she\u2019s noticed a movement to dismiss survivors\u2019 stories as attention-seeking attempts to \u201cbadmouth\u201d the community. And the sect\u2019s religious leaders in Mumbai still largely support khatna, Tahrer said, which makes it harder for local imams in India and the diaspora to publicly speak against it.\n\nStill, Tahrer believes the discussions the Nagarwala case have prompted within the Bohra community are a positive development."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Lydia O'Connor", "title": "5 Reasons Why Matthew Whitaker Isn\u2019t Qualified To Be Acting Attorney General", "description": "He may have broken the law by receiving political donations, for one.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/matthew-whitaker-not-qualified-attorney-general_us_5bf59726e4b03b230f9e03bb", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf5c8c4210000b906ca28cc.jpeg?ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T22:07:23Z", "content": "Matthew Whitaker, President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to replace ousted former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, has come under fire for his objections to investigating the president, his suspicious business history and his possible legal violations.

FACT\u2019s origins and funding remain obscure, and the group had no employees aside from Whitaker and existed only on paper, the Post said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very possible that this organization is misusing its status as a charity,\u201d David Nelson, a specialist on nonprofit organizations who reviewed FACT\u2019s tax filings for the Post, told the paper. \u201cIt appears the IRS never gave approval to FACT.\u201d\n\nHe may have broken the law by receiving political donations.\n\nOn Wednesday, the political watchdog group American Oversight called on the Office of Special Counsel to investigate Whitaker for possible violations of the Hatch Act, which restricts political activities by federal employees.\n\nThe complaint cites several political donations Whitaker received while serving as chief of staff and senior counselor in Session\u2019s office, according to his financial disclosure forms. In one example, the complaint notes that Whitaker\u2019s 2014 U.S. Senate campaign committee is still active and that he received four political contributions totaling $8,800 between Jan. 29 and Feb. 22 of this year.\n\n\u201cThe nation\u2019s highest law enforcement officer should be above reproach, but Acting Attorney General Whitaker\u2019s financial disclosures raise potential concerns of both dishonesty and covert partisan conflicts of interest,\u201d Austin Evers, American Oversight\u2019s executive director, said in a statement.\n\nThe filings also show that Whitaker revised his financial disclosure forms at least five times after he submitted them, HuffPost noted Tuesday.\n\nAP Photo/Mary Altaffer Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, framed by a photograph of lower Manhattan, addresses law enforcement officials at the Joint Terrorism Task Force on Nov. 21, 2018, in New York.\n\nIt may not be constitutional for him to act as attorney general.\n\nSeveral Democrats and legal scholars have argued that Trump\u2019s appointment of Whitaker as acting attorney general isn\u2019t legitimate.\n\nOn Monday, Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) filed a lawsuit calling into question Whitaker\u2019s eligibility to take on the role without being in another Senate-confirmed position at the time of his appointment, as all acting attorney generals in the past have been.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel issued a 20-page opinion last week arguing that Whitaker\u2019s appointment is lawful.\n\nUpon Sessions\u2019 forced resignation, several prominent legal scholars wrote in a New York Times op-ed that Whitaker\u2019s appointment was unconstitutional under the Appointments Clause, given that the role of attorney general is a \u201cprincipal\u201d position requiring Senate confirmation.\n\nHe\u2019s already taken a side in an investigation he should be impartial on.\n\nIn a conflict of interest that\u2019s most certainly not lost on Trump, Whitaker has been openly critical of Mueller\u2019s investigation into the Trump campaign \u2015 an investigation he now oversees until Trump taps a permanent replacement.\n\nWhitaker rose to prominence as a contributor on CNN, where he was best known for railing against the Mueller investigation. He insisted on air that nothing would come of it, that Mueller\u2019s budget should be capped, that Donald Trump Jr. was not in the wrong for meeting with a Russian lawyer to talk about Hillary Clinton and that investigating the Trump Organization\u2019s financial ties to Russia crossed a \u201cred line.\u201d\n\nIn a CNN editorial published earlier this month, Whitaker argued that Mueller\u2019s probe could become \u201ca mere witch hunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cMueller has come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing,\u201d Whitaker wrote.\n\nHe\u2019s friends with one of Mueller\u2019s grand jury witnesses.\n\nIn another conflict of interest, Whitaker has a close friendship with Sam Clovis, Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign co-chair who has testified before the grand jury in the Mueller investigation.\n\nClovis has said he and Whitaker became close when they ran against each other in a 2014 Senate primary campaign in Iowa. Whitaker eventually went on to serve as the chairman of Clovis\u2019 campaign for state treasurer.\n\nWalter Shaub, who served as director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics until resigning in July of last year, told Reuters that their relationship should disqualify Whitaker from overseeing Mueller\u2019s investigation."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "David Moye", "title": "Twitter Users Can't Get Enough Of Al Roker's 'Poon'", "description": "When Roker was asked the origin of the dish's name, he said simply, \u201cBecause that\u2019s what my mother told us it was.\u201d", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/al-roker-sweet-potato-poon-twitter_us_5bf5aeb9e4b0771fb6b57827", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf5b9d22100009c06ca28c6.png?cache=fthco5nujg&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T21:34:28Z", "content": "A lot of Twitter users are dishing about Al Roker s favorite holiday dish: poon.

Tigar, who is based in San Francisco, put a stop on Monday to the Trump administration\u2019s ban on refugees seeking asylum outside official points of entry along the U.S. border.\n\nTrump attacked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which would hear an appeal of Tigar\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cYou cannot win, when you\u2019re us, in the 9th Circuit,\u201d Trump said outside the White House when asked about the ruling.\n\nThe president complained that \u201cthey\u201d file suits in the left-leaning 9th Circuit purposefully so that \u201cwe get beaten, and then we end up having to go to the Supreme Court.\u201d In the case of the asylum ban, \u201cthey\u201d refers to the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights.\n\nReferring to Tigar, he said on Tuesday, \u201cThis was an Obama judge.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 21, 2018\n\nTrump\u2019s scorn for the nation\u2019s judicial system isn\u2019t new. The 9th Circuit ruled against the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to enact a travel ban for people from several Muslim-majority countries last year, prompting Trump to sneer at a \u201cso-called judge\u201d in one of the cases.\n\nOver Twitter on Wednesday, the president once again suggested the 9th Circuit was not an \u201cindependent judiciary\u201d by claiming \u201cso many opposing view\u201d cases are filed there.\n\nTrump cited a Fox News statistic on the court in a subsequent tweet on Wednesday, saying the Supreme Court has reversed 79 percent of decisions in cases it takes from the 9th Circuit. According to PolitiFact, the Supreme Court did reverse 79 percent of 9th Circuit\u2019s decisions between 2010 and 2015. But in that time frame, the Supreme Court reversed even more decisions in cases from two other courts, the 6th Circuit and the 11th Circuit.\n\nNotably, Trump has the opportunity to pack the 9th Circuit with some young, conservative judges, as there are currently six vacancies there.\n\nThe squabble between the heads of the executive and judicial branches comes more than a month after a nasty partisan battle to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh left some justices concerned about the Supreme Court\u2019s reputation as an impartial arbiter of justice.\n\nFollowing Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation last month, Roberts stressed the importance of maintaining the judicial system\u2019s independence from what he called the \u201cpolitical branches\u201d of government. The Supreme Court, he said, \u201cwould be very different without that sort of independence.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Curtis M.

DNA evidence also linked him to the crime. The jury, made up of seven women and five men, struggled to reach an agreement in the trial\u2019s final hours, however.\n\nWABC \u2013 NY Karina Vetrano, 30, was jogging in a New York City park in August 2016 when, authorities say, she was strangled and sexually assaulted.\n\n\u201cAfter deliberating for the entire day we are split,\u201d the jury wrote in a letter to Judge Michael Aloise obtained by the New York Post. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like we can make progress.

He denied sexually assaulting her.\n\nLewis\u2019 DNA was found beneath her fingernails as well as on her neck and her cellphone. He had a hand injury that prosecutors said was consistent with punching someone.\n\nNew York Daily News Archive via Getty Images Authorities said Chanel Lewis, who was 20 at the time of Vetrano's death, confessed to carrying out the attack but denied sexually assaulting her.\n\nMembers of his defense team argued that his confession was forced during an hours-long interrogation. They also tried to downplay the DNA evidence, and one of his lawyers, Robert Moeller, told the Times, \u201cPeople\u2019s DNA can end up in places that they\u2019ve never been.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we have said since day one, this case is far from conclusive and the jury\u2019s deadlock proves this,\u201d the Legal Aid Society, which represents Lewis, said in a statement. \u201cThe death of Karina Vetrano is tragic and our hearts go out to her family, but the rush to criminalize our client is not the answer nor is it justice.\u201d\n\nProsecutors said they will retry Lewis, who is scheduled to return to court on Jan. 22."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "HuffPost Video", "title": "Barack Obama Helps Out Chicago Food Bank For Thanksgiving", "description": "Former President Barack Obama is taking time during the holiday season to volunteer at a local Chicago food bank.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-helps-out-for-thanksgiving_us_5bf5becce4b0f8aa9bdd9bdf", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf5d8621f000036062638d3.jpeg?cache=Ua7D2pT3Tk&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T20:21:03Z", "content": "Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.

In it, she pleaded with Eisenhower to \u201csee that justice [was] meted out to all persons involved\u201d in her son\u2019s murder, which took place in Money, Mississippi.\n\nShe received nothing in response \u2014 not correspondence from the White House and not justice for her 14-year-old son.\n\nEisenhower Presidential Museum In a telegram to the White House, the mother then known as Mamie Bradley pleaded with the Eisenhower administration to investigate the brutal murder of her son.\n\nThis is helpful context for understanding the culture of Mississippi. While the state may have been rescued from the scourge of slavery, in many ways it still upholds the character of that era and the repressive years that followed. Mississippi boasts a higher percentage of black residents than any other state, a fact that historians say fueled its long tradition of anti-blackness dating back to the antebellum years. Since the murder of Emmett Till, there have been more lynchings in Mississippi than in all other states combined, according to the Tuskegee Institute\u2019s Department of Records and Research.\n\nAll this is to say that when Mississippi\u2019s Republican Senate candidate, Cindy Hyde-Smith, gleefully invoked hanging to express appreciation for a supporter of hers, she was drawing from a sordid history that is especially potent in her home state.\n\n\u201cIf [the supporter] invited me to a public hanging,\u201d she told a crowd during a campaign stop, \u201cI\u2019d be on the front row.\u201d Hyde-Smith was met with raucous applause. In a separate incident that surfaced later, the candidate was heard endorsing the idea of making it harder for her opponent\u2019s likely supporters to vote.\n\nHyde-Smith, the incumbent senator, will face Democratic candidate Mike Espy, a black man and former U.S. secretary of agriculture, in a run-off election scheduled for Nov. 27.\n\nAnd when President Donald Trump visits Mississippi on her behalf \u2015 which he plans to do on Monday \u2015 he has given us every reason to believe that he will go because of Hyde-Smith\u2019s racist evocations, and not in spite of them.\n\nJust as we reflect on the oppressive periods before ours and rack our brains wondering how so many could allow a culture so based on racism, the same will be said of us years down the line.\n\nTrump\u2019s embrace and exploitation of racial animus rivals even the efforts of his ideological forebears. The strategy in Nixon\u2019s \u201cSouthern Strategy,\u201d of course, was to maintain a pretense of deniability while ascending to the White House on a current of racism. A conflicted Eisenhower still begrudgingly affirmed civil rights protections by sending troops to Little Rock, Arkansas, to enforce the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nDonald Trump has no such interest in pretense.\n\nJust as we reflect on the oppressive periods before ours and rack our brains wondering how so many could allow a culture so based on racism, the same will be said of us years down the line. And when history is written, it will reveal that Donald Trump did not power his rise on his own; he flourished in a media environment that permitted his brand of racism by excusing it as ignorance or cynical politics. By default, we assume Trump and his administration are motivated by political expediency and not racial hatred.\n\nWe are subject to the whim of a journalistic establishment more obsessed with political cordiality than the ugly, bitter hatred beneath it.\n\nBut what if we are wrong? What if the racism we see is not a calculated ploy to achieve some other political goal \u2014 like tax cuts or increased investment in fossil fuels \u2014 but just simply racism? What if, to use a metaphor, there actually are monsters under your bed? How do you train people to see what they\u2019ve long been told doesn\u2019t exist?\n\nThat epitomizes the most pressing dilemma of our time. We \u2014 I\u2019m speaking as a receiver of media and not a creator \u2014 are subject to the whim of a journalistic establishment more obsessed with political cordiality than the ugly, bitter hatred beneath it, even when the hatred is far more determinative of how our political winds blow than the cordiality.\n\nWe as media need to understand the direness of our time. We need to realize that we will be written into American history either as complicit parties unequipped to challenge our worst national impulses or a force more righteous.\n\nWe need to realize that the president of the United States stumping in the lynching capital of the country, on behalf of a candidate who joyously invoked that state\u2019s violent history, must not be treated as politics as usual."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Kimberly Yam", "title": "Biology Student Uses BTS Members To Explain Parts Of The Animal Cell", "description": "Now it all makes sense.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bts-kpop-biology-student-animal-cell_us_5bf596e8e4b0eb6d930af14c", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf5af6b210000b406ca28c0.jpeg?ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T19:50:44Z", "content": "After reading her explanation, it really all makes sense.

Those planning to attend politically mixed dinners were more likely than the rest to expect a fight, but not by all that much \u2015 20 percent said it was at least somewhat likely an argument would break out.\n\nThe poll numbers are broadly consistent with HuffPost/YouGov polling in 2016 and 2017 \u2015 even immediately after the presidential election, only a minority of the public wanted to hash out its consequences over turkey.

Solis/The Associated Press Lonnie Bunch, founding director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, looks at a Ku Klux Klan display in the new Mississippi Civil Rights Museum in Jackson last April. African-American museums and historic sites are flourishing amid increasing interest in black history.\n\nBy Martha T. Moore\n\nBlack history museums and historic sites are flourishing across the South, riding a wave of interest in African-American history that has made a stunning success of the two-year-old National Museum of African American History and Culture in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nAnd in Charleston, South Carolina, construction is set to begin next year on a projected $75 million black history museum that will stand on the former site of Gadsden\u2019s Wharf, the disembarkation point for more than 100,000 Africans brought to America and sold into slavery.\n\nAt a time when attendance at some large museums is flagging \u2014 12 of the 20 biggest U.S. museums saw flat or lower attendance in 2017 compared with 2016 \u2014 the swirl of activity involving black history stands out.\n\nIn Church Creek on Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore, for example, a year-old, 17-acre state-national park memorializing the place where Harriet Tubman was born and enslaved was expected to draw 75,000 visitors in its first year; it attracted 100,000.\n\nMeanwhile, curators have rewritten exhibits at sites such as Mount Vernon and Monticello, the homes of Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. They\u2019ve also added information and buildings to teach visitors about the lives of enslaved people who worked on the plantations.\n\n\u201cRelevant history is inclusive history. Everyone is racing to do that,\u2019\u2019 said John Dichtl, president and CEO of the American Association for State and Local History, based in Nashville. Museums and other institutions \u201care all working on emphasizing the history of civil rights and the history of race relations and the history of slavery. It\u2019s a priority for everyone.\u2019\u2019\n\nHistory professionals cite several factors for the increased interest, including the availability of more federal money, Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, and the 50th anniversaries of many civil rights milestones.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement, controversies over Confederate monuments, protests by NFL players and last year\u2019s violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, also have prompted more Americans to want to \u201cgrapple with these issues of identity, with race, with nationalism and what that means,\u201d according to Brian Carter, president of the Association of African American Museums, based in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cThe country is changing. It\u2019s looking at itself in different ways than it has historically,\u201d Carter said. \u201cMuseums help people make meaning of their own experiences.\u201d\n\nNew federal money also has helped. In 2016, the National Park Service began giving grants to African-American historical sites for personnel, programming and research, though not for construction. This year, the park service awarded $12.6 million in grants to 51 projects in 24 states, up from $7.8 million in grants to 39 projects in 2017.\n\nAnd last summer, the National Trust for Historic Preservation announced a $25 million grant campaign to support important African-American sites \u2014 including the home of jazz great John Coltrane in Dix Hills, New York.\n\nPablo Martinez Monsivais/The Associated Press Former Secretary of State Colin Powell arrives for the dedication of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., in 2016.\n\nRaising the Bar\n\nThe new museums and historic sites would be happy to achieve a fraction of the success of the National Museum of African American History and Culture. That museum, which occupies a prime location on the National Mall, drew 2.4 million visitors in 2017, making it one of the 10 most-visited museums in the United States.\n\nThe museum, which is part of the Smithsonian Institution, \u201craised the bar of awareness around African-American history and museums. It just stimulated wanting to know more,\u2019\u2019 said Michael Boulware Moore, president of Charleston\u2019s International African American Museum. \u201cThis history has largely been muted forever and now this history has been coming out. Now African-Americans, and Americans broadly, are just curious about this.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhen the national museum opened, \u201cwe thought that might have the impact of sucking all the air out of the room. Just the opposite,\u2019\u2019 Moore said. Instead, it has been a catalyst for more presentations of black history, rather than the final word on the subject.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be an oversaturation of African-American history in this country for quite some time,\u2019\u2019 Moore said. \u201cThere are art museums everywhere, and there are history museums everywhere. I see it as really healthy that there will be African-American museums everywhere.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe museum on the Mall also has provided concrete help to other African-American museums. It supports paid internships at museums, including some specifically for students at historically black colleges and universities, and subsidizes professional development conferences for museum personnel. And it provides travel grants for museum professionals to attend the annual conference of the Association of African American Museums.\n\nCivil Rights Tourism\n\nStates also are investing in campaigns to promote civil rights tourism. Prompted in part by the 50th anniversaries of seminal events of the 1960s, 14 Southern state tourism agencies in January unveiled a joint website detailing stops on what they are calling the U.S. Civil Rights Trail.\n\nIt lists about 130 destinations, from the Woolworth\u2019s lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, that was the site of the first sit-in by black students, to a statue of civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer in her birthplace of Ruleville, Mississippi.\n\nThe Associated Press An unidentified white man sits in front of a Greyhound bus to prevent it from leaving the station with a load of Freedom Riders in Anniston, Alabama, in 1961. The Anniston bus station is being restored with state and federal money.\n\nObama declared national monuments at civil rights historic sites in Birmingham and Anniston, Alabama, just before leaving office. Now buildings at those sites \u2014 the A.G. Gaston Motel in Birmingham and the Greyhound bus station in Anniston, where Freedom Riders were attacked in 1961 \u2014 are being restored with local and federal funds.\n\nPresident Donald Trump last month designated his first national monument at Camp Nelson, near Lexington, Kentucky, where blacks fled during the Civil War to join the Union Army and where they and their families lived in refugee settlements and sought emancipation. His administration also has been expanding the African American Civil Rights Network of historic sites and started the process to designate the Medgar Evers home in Jackson, Mississippi, as a national monument.\n\nCivil rights landmarks have been \u201coverwhelmed by the response and interest,\u2019\u2019 said Lee Sentell, tourism director for Alabama, which has had its own civil rights trail.\n\n\u201cThe idea of grouping them under one umbrella has been very well-received because it helps tell the general public that these landmarks are not one-offs,\u201d Sentell said. Instead, the sites \u201ccollectively outline the progression that led to landmark Supreme Court decisions and congressional legislation that dismantled legal white supremacy.\u201d\n\nThe South Carolina African American Heritage Commission last year created a \u201cGreen Book\u201d mobile app that includes 300 historic African-American sites in the state. The app is named for the Jim Crow-era guides for black travelers that detailed safe places to get food and lodging. North Carolina is planning its own Green Book app that will include sites that were in the original guidebook.\n\n\u201cCultural tourism, or heritage tourism, is one of the fastest growing markets in the country,\u2019\u2019 said Jannie Harriot, vice chairperson of the South Carolina commission."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Sara Boboltz", "title": "5 Times Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker Critiqued The Mueller Investigation On CNN", "description": "Now the top Justice Department official, Whitaker oversees special counsel Robert Mueller and an investigation he's railed against.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/acting-attorney-general-matt-whitaker-critiqued-the-mueller-investigation-on-cnn_us_5bf584dfe4b03b230f9dc6e8", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf586d42400009404583724.jpeg?cache=a7dehpxni1&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T19:03:07Z", "content": "Before Matt Whitaker was tapped to replace his boss, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, he was perhaps best known as a commenter on CNN, where he provided a right-wing viewpoint by ranting against the Russia investigation.

Before being named acting attorney general, he was Sessions\u2019 chief of staff. The most logical replacement would have been the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein.\n\nThe legitimacy of President Donald Trump\u2019s appointment of Whitaker has already been called into question, as he has so publicly criticized the very investigation he now oversees at the Department of Justice. CNN paid him $15,000 last year to opine on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into foreign interference in the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign was involved.\n\nTaken together, these Whitaker opinions present what appears to be clear conflict of interest. Here are five examples:\n\nThat time Whitaker said nothing would come of the investigation.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence \u2014 and we would know by now, with as much leaking as there has been \u2014 that there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials,\u201d Whitaker said on CNN in June 2017.\n\nThat time Whitaker suggested capping Mueller\u2019s budget to impede the investigation.\n\n\u201cI could see a scenario where Jeff Sessions is replaced with a recess appointment, and that attorney general does not fire Bob Mueller, but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt,\u201d he said on a CNN panel in July 2017.\n\nThat time Whitaker defended Donald Trump Jr. for meeting with a Russian lawyer to talk about Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cWe have no information right now that would suggest that he knew who this individual was that he was meeting with,\u201d he said on CNN later in July 2017. \u201cThey just knew that they must have been sold the fact that there was some really good information that they needed to hear.\u201d\n\nThe legality of Trump Jr.\u2019s actions \u2015 seeking damaging information on an opposing political candidate from a foreign government \u2015 is extremely murky. The president\u2019s eldest son may have broken U.S. election law.\n\nThat time Whitaker said investigating the Trump Organization\u2019s finances for ties to Russia crossed a \u201cred line.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot have [an] unaccountable prosecutor that pursues whatever they want to pursue,\u201d Whitaker told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo in August 2017. Mueller has reportedly been looking into possible ties between the Trump Organization and Russia as part of his investigation.\n\nThe special prosecutor has handed off one tangentially related investigation \u2015 illegal business dealings by Trump\u2019s former personal attorney Michael Cohen \u2015 to other prosecutors, however.\n\nThat time he wrote the network an op-ed titled \u201cMueller\u2019s investigation is going too far.\u201d\n\nWhitaker said in the editorial, published this month, that the probe could be \u201ca mere witch hunt.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Melissa Jeltsen", "title": "Tamara O\u2019Neal Was Almost Erased From The Story Of Her Own Murder", "description": "In Chicago\u2019s Mercy Hospital shooting, a man killed his ex-fiancee, but news stories homed in on the police officer who died at the scene.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tamara-oneal-chicago-shooting-domestic-violence_us_5bf576a6e4b0771fb6b4ceef", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf577ce2400006f0499ba80.jpeg?cache=mblbgns2xd&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:53:41Z", "content": "Tamara ONeal had just finished up her emergency room shift at Mercy Hospital in Chicago on Nov. 19 when Juan Lopez, her ex-fiance, materialized in the parking lot.

O'Neal was fatally shot by her former fiance in Chicago the day before.\n\nDr. Tamara O\u2019Neal had just finished up her emergency room shift at Mercy Hospital in Chicago on Nov. 19 when Juan Lopez, her ex-fiance, materialized in the parking lot. He knew where to find her. Earlier in the day, he rang the hospital trying to get her on the phone. She told the clerk who took the call to tell him she was busy.\n\nAs recently as September, O\u2019Neal, 38, had planned to marry Lopez. But something caused her to change her mind, and a few weeks before the wedding, she broke off the engagement. On Monday the sight of him scared her enough to dial 911.\n\nIn the parking lot, he claimed to want his engagement ring back, but that was an excuse, another attempt to control her. He revealed his true intentions when he pulled out his gun and shot her six times. Afterward, he ran into the hospital and kept shooting, killing Dayna Less, a 24-year-old pharmacy resident, and Samuel Jimenez, 28, a rookie officer with the Chicago Police Department, before being killed by officer gunfire.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the shooting, when the facts were still being sorted, the media latched onto the policeman who was killed in the line of duty. His death \u2015 understood as the most newsworthy component of the incident \u2015 became the story. Headlines, captions and mobile alerts (including HuffPost\u2019s), focused on him. In The New York Times, for example, O\u2019Neal was not named until the fifth paragraph, as one of the \u201cother victims,\u201d and her relationship to the shooter wasn\u2019t explained until later in the story.\n\nSomehow, a mass shooting rooted in gendered violence was framed as a random act. Even Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel in a news conference said the mass shooting was \u201cthe consequence of evil.\u201d\n\nBut the shooting was not random at all. It was the consequence of domestic violence. And by relegating O\u2019Neal to a supporting part in the story, the media fundamentally misrepresented the nature of the attack. The massacre was a result of her ex-partner\u2019s final attempt to control her.\n\n\u201cWe are not connecting the dots correctly,\u201d said Monica McLaughlin, the director of public policy at the National Network to End Domestic Violence.\n\nThe erasure of O\u2019Neal from the narrative obscures the motivation behind the attack, McLaughlin added, making it harder for the public to recognize the undercurrent of toxic masculinity in American gun violence.\n\nMonte Gerlach Photography via AP Tamara O'Neal in September 2017. Although her killing was the consequence of domestic violence, many news outlets at first minimized her in their reports about a mass shooting.\n\n\u201cViolence against women is a common denominator in many, many, many of these shootings,\u201d she said.\n\nAs HuffPost has reported, most mass shootings in the U.S. involve a man targeting his intimate partner or another family member. And among mass shooters who target the public in random acts of violence, many have histories of abusive behavior toward women. (See: Pulse, Parkland, Sutherland Springs.)\n\nDavid Adams, a domestic violence expert who has studied men who kill their partners, said many homicidal abusers feel a sense of ownership over their wife or girlfriend.\n\n\u201cThey blame their partners for their own problems and, in general, see themselves as victims of unappreciative, selfish partners,\u201d he said. Men who kill their partners as part of a mass shooting may simply want a larger audience to advertise their grievances, he added.\n\nLike many mass shooters before him, Lopez had a history of abusive behavior toward women. He was fired from the Chicago Fire Academy in 2014 after he was accused of inappropriate conduct with female cadets. The same year, his then-wife filed an emergency protective order against him. \u201cI fear that my safety is in jeopardy,\u201d she wrote, stating that he was acting erratically with his firearm and had threatened to go to her job and cause a scene.\n\nFour years later, he followed through on his threat to cause a scene at a workplace, only this time it was to confront O\u2019Neal. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t let it go,\u201d her father, Tom O\u2019Neal, told the Chicago Sun-Times. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t let go and he took her away from us.\u201d\n\nRuth Glenn, the executive director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said she understood the gut instinct among media outlets to emphasize the police officer\u2019s death. Unfortunately, when it comes to gun violence, there is a hierarchy of newsworthiness. A police officer killed in the line of duty makes headlines far more often than a woman slain by her intimate partner. Especially, Glenn said, if she is a woman of color.\n\n\u201c[Police officers] put their lives on the line every day,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you think about it, so does a victim when she has decided that she needs to be away from the violence.\u201d\n\nA mass shooting rooted in gendered violence was framed as a random act.\n\nWomen are at the highest risk of being killed when they leave their partners, said Maureen Curtis, the vice president of criminal justice programs for the nonprofit group Safe Horizon. For many women, their workplaces can become a place of heightened danger, as their partners know when and where they work.\n\nIn 2017, Karen Elaine Smith was teaching an elementary class in San Bernardino, California, when her husband, whom she had recently left, walked in with a handgun and began shooting, killing her and an 8-year-old student.\n\n\u201cThis is one reason why we need to recognize that domestic violence is not just a personal matter and that helping and supporting a victim not only can save her life but the lives of others,\u201d Curtis said.\n\nErasing domestic violence from the story also does a disservice to the police officer slain, said Mark Wynn, a retired Tennessee officer who now travels the country training police on issues related to violence against women.\n\nCalls related to domestic disputes are the most dangerous for police, he said.

While it\u2019s easy to blame it on your last viewing of \u201cThe Shining\u201d or some other terrifying film, the true culprits of our nightmares are the seemingly mundane activities we do every day.\n\nNightmares are different from regular not-so-great dreams because they wake us up suddenly, often during the early hours when we\u2019re well into our rapid eye movement sleep. Nightmares are also not to be confused with night terrors, which typically happen soon after we fall asleep, and which feel very real \u2015 so waking up feels even more terrifying.\n\nNightmares are more common among children than adults, but that doesn\u2019t mean adults don\u2019t experience them. An estimated 50 percent of adults have occasional nightmares, according to psychology experts. Women have them more frequently than men.\n\n\u201cIn general, nightmares aren\u2019t a threat to sleep quality or health,\u201d said Ginger Houghton, a licensed clinical social worker and owner of Bright Spot Counseling in Michigan. \u201cHowever, if the nightmares are consistent and severe enough that a person struggles at work, home or school or if they want to avoid sleep, it\u2019s time to find a board-certified sleep medicine doctor.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the nightmares are consistent and severe enough that a person struggles at work, home or school or if they want to avoid sleep, it\u2019s time to find a board-certified sleep medicine doctor.\u201d - Ginger Houghton, licensed clinical social worker\n\nChances are good this doesn\u2019t describe you: Only about 1 percent of adults have nightmares frequent enough that they need to seek professional help. But that doesn\u2019t mean you should just brush off your bad dream. Dina Merhbi, a registered dietitian in Montreal and founder of the Body Balance Method, said that even one nightmare can increase your fatigue, which may lead to unhealthy habits the next day.\n\n\u201cSleep is a time for the body to relax and reboot for the next day,\u201d Merhbi said. \u201cHowever, nightmares cause a high anxiety state that actually prevents the body from relaxing, and will cause changes in the next day like increased fatigue, heightened senses, [and] increased caffeine and sugar intake.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the long term,\u201d she said, \u201cwith recurrent nightmares, this will impact the energy and mental health of the person and might become a catalyst for depression, anxiety and even health issues such as glucose intolerance and high blood pressure.\u201d\n\nAnd while the link is not fully understood, experts have found a connection between frequent nightmares and mental health problems. Studies have found that people experiencing regular nightmares are at a higher risk of self-harm and suicide.\n\nSo how do you get control over your nightmares? One way is to look at what could be contributing to them. Below are a few things that could be adding to the problem, according to experts:\n\nYou\u2019re dealing with mental health problems.\n\nLuis Alvarez via Getty Images\n\nAccording to John Mayer, a clinical psychologist practicing in Chicago, negative thinking and unresolved issues play a huge role in determining what kind of nightmares, and how many of them, you might have.\n\n\u201cOur brains work like a computer; what goes in equals what comes out,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cSo, if you go to bed with negative thoughts or you\u2019re replaying negatives from your day, boom! Your brain is going to be loaded with negative thoughts to recycle while you sleep.\u201d\n\nOne Finnish study found that people who have severe depression or even just a negative self-attitude were likely to have more nightmares. In fact, 28 percent of their participants who had severe depression also reported having frequent nightmares.\n\nWhile depression is definitely a factor, general stress from everyday life can also have a significant impact on bad dreams and sleep quality. Common circumstances, such as moving, having an upcoming test or changing roles at work, can trigger a nightmare. Grief and other serious issues can also increase your risk.\n\n\u201cStress, unresolved conflicts and personal tragedies all contribute toward generating nightmares,\u201d said Damian Sendler, a clinician who specializes in treating patients with psychological and psychiatric conditions in New York. \u201cNightmares are \u2014 in a way \u2014 the pimples of our imagination. Just as with pimples that show up after there is an excessive accumulation of dirt and bacteria in the skin, nightmares are the byproduct of the mind corrupted by troubles and worries.\u201d\n\nYou have certain personality traits.\n\nSome research has indicated that character traits may contribute to bad dreams. A 2001 study looked at people who were experiencing around two nightmares a month and found that those who are more sensitive are more likely to have frequent bad dreams. Another study discovered that people with artistic and creative interests are also more likely to experience nightmares on a regular basis.\n\nAustrian-American psychoanalyst and sleep researcher Ernest Hartmann found that people with thinner personality boundaries \u2014 those who are open-minded, sensitive and creative \u2014 are more likely to have longer, vivid, detailed and emotional dreams. And that dream content usually \u201cshowed a trend towards correlation with aggressive interaction and nightmare-likeness.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re processing a trauma.\n\nAccording to a 2015 study, nightmares are a major symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder. This can make it difficult to fall asleep again, which can in turn make the whole next day more challenging.\n\n\u201cSome people wake with a sad or scared feeling after nightmares, which can be a difficult start to the day,\u201d said Alex Dimitriu, a physician and founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry & Sleep Medicine. \u201cIf this occurs rarely, it is quite normal. However, regular frequent nightmares can be a sign of either some repressed memory, trauma, or possibly sleep apnea or sleep disturbance.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople with PTSD are most commonly known to experience recurring nightmares, often around the traumatic event,\u201d Dimitriu said. \u201cIn these instances, we always advise seeking professional help.\u201d\n\nYou ate before bed.\n\nAJ_Watt via Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s pretty well understood that late-night snacking isn\u2019t the best thing for your health, but you might not realize it could be the source of your nightmares. Eating a big meal, or even just a snack, increases your metabolism and body temperature. This causes your brain to be more active, and thus could lead to more nightmares.\n\nA 2015 study by the University of Montreal found that 9.5 percent of people had bad dreams after indulging in a late-night meal. Another 2015 study surveyed almost 400 students and had them keep a record of their dreams, and of what they ate, for two weeks. About 44 percent of people reported that ice cream and other dairy products caused bizarre and disturbing dreams. And there\u2019s even some evidence to suggest spicy foods can lead to nightmares.\n\nYou had a nightcap.\n\nWhile drinking alcohol might initially help you fall asleep, your night is going to be anything but restful. At some point, the alcohol metabolizes and the sedative effect wears off, creating fragmented sleep and nightmares, according to the Cleveland Clinic. And thanks to that vodka tonic, your dreams and nightmares will be way more vivid than usual. There\u2019s even a chance you\u2019ll \u201cact out\u201d your dreams or sleepwalk.\n\nYour medication is messing with your sleep.\n\nCertain drugs may also affect nightmares. According to the Mayo Clinic, blood pressure medications, antidepressants, antihistamines (found in sleep aids and allergy medicines) and steroids are some of the typical offenders. Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and cholesterol-lowering medications can also contribute to disturbed sleep and bad dreams.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the 1 to 5 percent of people who take these medications and have nightmares \u2015 and it\u2019s affecting your quality of life \u2015 check in with your doctor.\n\nHow can you prevent nightmares?\n\nAdene Sanchez via Getty Images\n\nIn addition to treating any mental health issues, watching your eating habits before bed and talking to your doctor about medication intake, there are a few things you can do to make sure you get a good nightmare-free sleep. Healthy lifestyle habits like meditation, therapy, exercise and journaling can help improve sleep, which in turn may help with your nightmares.\n\nAlex Tran, a wellness expert and yoga teacher in California, said that meditation helped her clear negative thought patterns from her abusive childhood that she believed were contributing to her frequent nightmares.\n\n\u201cI grew up having nightmares two to three times a week,\u201d she said. \u201cI found yoga in my early 20s, and the physical practice introduced me to the meditative practice. This has allowed me to clear my thoughts while drifting into sleep, get rid of my nightmares and enjoy a peaceful sleep.\u201d\n\nBecause nightmares can sometimes be a sign of an unresolved issue or conflict in your life, Dara Bushman, a licensed clinical psychologist practicing in South Florida, said acknowledging the problem before you fall asleep could also help with prevention.\n\n\u201cFrequent nightmares are often the result of the mind processing a prior event,\u201d she said. \u201cThe mind does not respond to \u2018don\u2019t\u2019 think of something. In fact, when you drive by a car accident, and someone tells you not to look, the first thing someone does is look. You can prevent nightmares by thinking of the uncomfortable stimulus.\u201d\n\nDream expert and author Lauri Loewenberg suggests that nightmares are not something to be feared. Rather, they\u2019re a tool to help you manage and assess your overall well-being.\n\n\u201cThe occasional nightmare may keep you from being able to fall back asleep and have you a bit upset the following day but is typically not harmful,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, it can be very good for you because it is the subconscious alerting you to something that is wrong in your life [like] a difficult, ignored or mishandled issue that needs attention and correction.\u201d\n\nSo next time you find yourself jolted awake after being chased by a monster in your sleep, ask yourself what that monster might represent. It could be the first step to put it \u2014 and the rest of your nightmares \u2014 away for good."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Ron Dicker", "title": "So Jimmy Fallon Was Challenged To Do 25 Pushups...", "description": "The \"Tonight Show\" host tested whether he was fit for duty in a dare from Michael Strahan.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jimmy-fallon-pushups-michael-strahan_us_5bf58538e4b0771fb6b50435", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf58b93220000f905de3ef3.png?cache=p88e1k9twh&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T18:33:12Z", "content": "When guest Michael Strahan prodded Jimmy Fallon into attempting 25 pushups on The Tonight Show Tuesday, we could understand if the host were a bit hesitant.

According to three separate testimonies obtained by Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch, the torture included electric shock, whipping, sleep deprivation tactics and sexual misconduct including forcible kissing, touching and sexual assault.\n\nThe activists showed physical evidence of torture that included red marks on the body, uncontrollable shaking in the hands; some were unable to walk or even stand. One testimony alleged that a woman was hung from the ceiling for a long period of time, and at least one activist attempted suicide multiple times while detained. The activists were also reportedly kept in solitary confinement for at least several months.\n\nHuman Rights Watch reported that it was \u201cunclear whether [Saudi officials] were seeking to force the women to sign confessions or merely to punish them for their peaceful advocacy.\u201d\n\nThe reports come just weeks after Khashoggi, a Washington Post journalist and resident of the U.S., disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.

It signaled to that country\u2019s extremists that their pushing of conspiracy theories was working so effectively that a world leader had signed on.\n\nSimon Roche, a South African white nationalist seen alongside neo-Nazis at the deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year, is the public face of his country\u2019s white genocide hysteria. He\u2019s a leader of the Suidlanders, an organized group of white supremacists who believe that a race war is coming.\n\nIf any one person is the barometer for white supremacist anxiety in South Africa, it\u2019s Roche, and he sees Trump as a champion of his movement.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s tweet, \u201cwe saw a ray of hope,\u201d Roche told CNN. \u201cMaybe there are people out there who know and care and have power and influence. Only time will tell how much is smoke and mirrors, shadows and dust.\u201d\n\nAs a groan-worthy bonus to that interview, Roche regurgitated Trump\u2019s \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d rhetoric when talking about far-right extremist groups in the U.S. and the Charlottesville rally.

I\u2019d only survived thanks to the unbelievable heroism of my crew, so from the moment I woke up in the hospital, my conception of gratitude was forever changed.\n\nI was grateful to breathe. To cry. To have my husband by my side and my life still ahead of me. I spent that Thanksgiving in more pain than I thought possible \u2015 but I was also more thankful than I\u2019d ever been.\n\nIt was then and there that I vowed to myself to find new ways to serve this country \u2015 no longer from the cockpit, maybe, but through other avenues that would allow me to give back to the nation I loved so deeply.\n\nThe important thing isn\u2019t how you serve. It\u2019s that you\u2019re willing to serve in the first place.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: To this day, I\u2019d give anything to be back in the military, flying just one more mission with the crew I was lucky enough to be a part of.

It\u2019s that you\u2019re willing to serve in the first place.\n\nThat\u2019s why this fall I\u2019m reintroducing my 21st Century American Service Act, legislation that would ensure every young American who wants to serve their country has the ability to do so, regardless of their tax bracket or background.\n\nThe truth is, right now, a lot of Americans want to make a difference. But they never get the chance they deserve to change the world.\n\nToday, the acceptance rates for some AmeriCorps programs are close to those of certain Ivy League schools, with droves of people turned away every year. It\u2019s not because the work isn\u2019t there to be done \u2015 but because the resources aren\u2019t there to bring on as many folks as they need.\n\nBut just imagine what this country would look like if all those service-minded Americans who want to donate their time to improving rundown classrooms or giving food to the hungry were given the chance to do so.\n\nTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS Today, the acceptance rates for some AmeriCorps programs are close to those of certain Ivy League schools, with droves of people turned away every year.\n\nThat\u2019s the goal of my legislation.\n\nEveryone who applies to one of these national service programs would be given the opportunity to serve for a year, and those who complete that year would also earn benefits to help pay for college tuition or to pay down student debt.\n\nIt would help every young American who wants an education get one \u2015 and hand anyone who wants to serve the ability to do so, making national service more inclusive by both expanding the number of opportunities available and doubling the annual living stipend for participants. All with the hope of breaking down the barriers to entry that for far too long have kept far too many lower-income folks from becoming public servants.\n\nAfter all, just as we need a strong military to protect our nation, we need civilian volunteers to make sure the country those troops are defending is well-maintained and rebuilt \u2015 that its families are healthy and educated, housed and fed.\n\nThink about all the good that could be done if Americans were encouraged to give back.\n\nThere\u2019s hard data that backs up why this policy would be good for our country (studies have shown that every dollar we invest in national service generates almost $4 in returns to society). But to me, the reason we need this legislation is more qualitative than quantitative.\n\nFrom my months flying combat missions in Iraq to my weekends volunteering at the local food pantry, I know firsthand the feelings of commonality, camaraderie and shared sacrifice that arise among those serving a cause greater than themselves.\n\nThat sense of unity may be just what this nation needs to heal from the bitter, fear-stoked era we\u2019re living through, when it seems like some in power are more interested in tearing us apart than bringing us together.\n\nOver the next few days, countless Americans will volunteer their time and energy, plating slices of turkey and doling out helpings of gravy to those in need. But think about all the good that could be done if Americans were encouraged to give back not only this week but the other 51 weeks of the year, too.\n\nGiving back to a union that has its faults, sure. But it\u2019s a union whose people \u2015 whose service members in every sense of the word \u2015 strive to make it more perfect with every combat mission overseas as well as every hour in the soup kitchen."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Sara Boboltz", "title": "What To Know About The Romaine E.

It contaminates the human food supply several ways, such as through unsanitary irrigation or spraying, flooding, or animals who carry the bacteria onto farmland. A 2006 E. coli outbreak linked to spinach \u2015 which sickened hundreds \u2015 was caused by wild pigs wandering between cow pastures and spinach fields in California.\n\nHow do I know if I\u2019m infected?\n\nPeople who become sick with E. coli experience stomach cramps or pains, mild to severe diarrhea, and sometimes nausea or vomiting.\n\nA fraction of those affected \u2015 5 to 10 percent \u2015 also experience kidney failure, or hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can be life-threatening. Symptoms include a lower frequency of urination, feeling very tired and losing the pink color in your cheeks, the CDC says.\n\nMost people begin feeling sick three to four days after eating or drinking something that has the bacteria in it, although illness can begin anywhere from one to 10 days after consuming the contaminated food.\n\nUsually, symptoms clear up within five to seven days, but the most severe cases can lead to death.\n\nI think I have an E. coli infection. What do I do?\n\nCall your doctor, who may ask you to confirm the diagnosis with a stool sample. You are also asked to report your illness to state health departments, which in turn report to the CDC.

Baby romaine, spring mixes and Caesar salad mixes could all be affected, too.\n\nDon\u2019t order it at a restaurant, either, although restaurants have already been advised not to serve romaine or any lettuce mix containing romaine.\n\nThe CDC also recommends sanitizing your refrigerator by removing all the food, washing and drying removable parts, and cleaning the interior. A guide can be found here.\n\nWhere did the outbreak start?\n\nOfficials aren\u2019t sure yet. That\u2019s why the warning covers romaine all over the country.\n\nWhen can I eat romaine again?\n\nThe CDC has yet to identify any grower, supplier, distributor or brand of romaine lettuce common between those infected.

And many nonprofit organizations have sprung up to advocate the interests of minority groups, becoming recognized as important contributors to more balanced workplaces.\n\n\n\nThe organization I founded in 1994, the Asian American Business Development Center, was established with a mission of recognizing, encouraging and developing executives and entrepreneurs of Asian descent. We\u2019re proud of our heritage, and believe it is important to showcase successful Asian role models in business. We also believe in collective strength, and teamed up with CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion to support culturally sensitive workplaces.\n\n\n\nEncouragingly, younger generations appear to be more welcoming of cultural differences than those that came before. For instance, the millennial group, that much-analyzed \u2014 perhaps overanalyzed \u2014 generation of young adults, has demonstrated a much more open mindset than previous generations.\n\n\n\nLess noticed, perhaps, is the emergence of the next cohort: Generation Z, whose oldest members were born in 1998 and are on the cusp of starting their first jobs. Studies say that this generation will be the most racially diverse group ever. The Census Bureau estimates that by 2020, a tad over half, or 50.2 percent, of children under 18 are expected to come from a minority race or ethnic group.\n\n\n\nThis is the big wave of the \u201cmajority-minority\u201d population, the \u201cnew majority\u201d or the \u201cnew mainstream.\u201d And I can\u2019t help but wonder: Will this multi-ethnic cadre of employees find bosses who look like them? Or will they still be asking the types of questions that I, along with Black and Latino business leaders, have been posing for some time: Why aren\u2019t our corporate leaders a better reflection of our diverse employees, customers and communities?\n\n\n\nWithin my lifetime, there have absolutely been positive changes around inclusion. My organization was privileged to have the support of PepsiCo for our diversity initiatives during Indra Nooyi\u2019s tenure as CEO. We were thrilled to have Xerox CEO Ursula Burns attend one of our annual Outstanding 50 Asian Americans in Business dinners. And Lisa Su, whom we recognized with a Pinnacle Award, occupies a rare spot as the female and minority CEO of a major tech company, AMD.\n\n\n\nBut it\u2019s undeniable that boardrooms and corner suites still lack leaders of color. Many studies support this fact, and one recent confirmation of this was when the BBC ran a story that included a composite photo of the CEOs of the top 100 of the Fortune 500 companies. Unsurprisingly, the image that emerged was that of a Caucasian male.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, there\u2019s widespread agreement that companies with diverse leadership and boards fare better financially than those that don\u2019t. We think that diversity is part of smart business strategy, not about quotas or preferences. In fact, we host conferences and panel discussions each year highlighting the connection between diversity and growth, including our fourth annual Asian American Business Roundtable, scheduled for Jan. 16, 2019, in New York City.\n\n\n\nForward-thinking businesses will not just pay attention to the words spoken about diversity and inclusion, but seek to earnestly translate them into actions. Doing so will put them at the front \u2014 and on the side \u2014 of their incoming workforces.\n\n\n\nAccording to a study by Goldman Sachs, Gen-Z members are not only more racially diverse than any previous generation, but they also embrace ethnic diversity in America more than prior generations. This reality will be a business reality, as well. It is estimated that by 2020, Gen Z will be 30 percent of the workforce, and 40 percent of the consumer market.\n\n\n\nAnd it\u2019s a consumer market not to be taken lightly. Research shows that Gen Z members have spending power amounting to over $100 billion, on par with the GDPs of some countries.\n\n\n\nGen Z may seem like a quiet generation for now, but I believe they will be a disruptive force in a few short years. I only hope we will be ready to lead them."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Ron Dicker", "title": "Robert De Niro And Wife Grace Hightower Reportedly Split", "description": "The couple began dating in the 1980s and married in 1997.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/robert-de-niro-grace-hightower-split_us_5bf56abee4b0771fb6b4aa78", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf56bff210000b406ca289e.png?ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T15:53:37Z", "content": "Robert De Niro and Grace Hightower have gone their separate ways after more than 20 years of marriage, The Hollywood Reporter and several other news outlets have reported.

In December, two sisters penned a petition challenging the Met\u2019s decision to exhibit a painting by the Polish-French modern artist Balthus, showing a 12-year-old girl in repose, her skirt upturned and her underwear exposed. The petition renewed a debate over the kind of conduct (between older, mostly male artists and historically young and female subjects) history is willing to not only condone but exalt.\n\nToday, discussions about artists\u2019 unsavory methods often revolve around sexuality and consent: whether artists abused their power in the process of creating art, engaged in sex that might not have been consensual and then used their creative practice as a shield to protect themselves.\n\nDegas\u2019 statue \u201cLittle Dancer, Age 14\u201d poses a somewhat different idea of dynamics between artist and subject, though one similarly fraught with gendered power imbalances. Laurens posits that it\u2019s highly unlikely Degas sexually abused 14-year-old van Goethem, because Degas was a well-documented celibate, his abstinence rooted in a disgust of womankind. But that disgust, Laurens argues, is a forgotten aspect of the modern art pioneer\u2019s story \u2015 as is his role in ruining the life of a girl whose image helped propel him to fame in the first place.\n\nDEA PICTURE LIBRARY via Getty Images Author Camille Laurens explores the relationship between Degas and van Goethem in her book Little Dancer Aged Fourteen.\n\nWe don\u2019t always know what occurred between painters and their subjects in the privacy of a studio, but some male artists have made it easy to surmise. \u201cHow lovely she was, naked in bed,\u201d French Romantic painter Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix said about one 15-year-old subject. Another artist, Puvis de Chavannes, was known to end his modeling sessions by asking, \u201cWould you like to see the ... of a great man?\u201d Laurens writes.\n\nThese men typify the predatory artist archetype at the center of today\u2019s Me Too conversation, which could be used to describe men like Harvey Weinstein or, allegedly, Terry Richardson. But Degas\u2019 abuse looked different. His is more familiar to pockets of the internet occupied by incels \u2015 heterosexual, cellibate men who breed a distrust of and hatred for women.\n\nLaurens traces Degas\u2019 misogyny back to his youth, when he is thought to have contracted a venereal disease from a brothel. As an adult, Degas fraternized with few women aside from his housekeepers. He feared them, his friends believed, especially with regard to how they\u2019d interfere with the quality of his work. His friend and fellow artist Jacques-Emile Blanche described him as \u201ca misogynist and a surgeon\u201d when he crafted van Goethem\u2019s image. He was a voyeur who adopted the attitude of a father figure, a chauvinist critic who embodied the basics of toxic masculinity.\n\nOver time, Degas\u2019 painted odes to the Paris Opera have taken on the rosy glow of nostalgia, all that tulle and ribbonry obscuring darker intentions. His impressionist ballerinas adorn coffee mugs and hang in dorm rooms, as universally and unequivocally beloved as Claude Monet\u2019s \u201cWater Lilies.\u201d In museums, young girls assume the dancers\u2019 poses for cute photo ops. Yet when Degas painted ballerinas, he saw neither budding talent nor charming naivet\u00e9. He saw \u201clittle rats,\u201d Laurens finds.\n\nGirls who became ballerinas \u2015 at as young as 8 years old \u2015 worked 10 to 12 hours a day, six to seven days a week, under devastating conditions. (One ballerina died after her tutu lit on fire during a rehearsal.) After reaching \u201csexual maturity\u201d at 13, girls were often paid to have sex with men waiting in the opera\u2019s wings. They earned the nickname \u201crats\u201d because the animals were known to transmit syphilis.\n\nFor Degas, the fact that young dancers had sex with old men read not as abuse on the part of the latter but as sin on the part of the former. He assumed girls\u2019 transactions with powerful men meant they could pull strings from behind the scenes, a thought that elicited both horror and fascination. Degas clearly saw something vital in his recurring subjects, who spurred quotes from him like, \u201cI have locked away my heart in a pink satin slipper.\u201d\n\nPicturenow via Getty Images Degas\u2019 odes to the Paris Opera have taken on the rosy glow of nostalgia, but when he painted his subjects, he saw neither budding talent nor charming naivet\u00e9.\n\nDegas\u2019 disdain for women \u2015 and ballerinas in particular \u2015 is writ across \u201cLittle Dancer\u201d itself, whose sculptural features were altered to emphasize van Goethem\u2019s moral degeneracy. Degas subscribed to physiognomy, which presumes that criminal behaviors are passed on genetically and thus manifest in physical features. And so he flattened van Goethem\u2019s skull and stretched her chin so she appeared especially \u201cprimitive,\u201d a visual reflection of an internal state.\n\nMade of pigmented beeswax, clay and metal armature, and dressed in genuine clothing and slippers, the sculpture was initially derided for resembling a common wax doll. The unvarnished ugliness Degas produced was a shock to the 19th-century art world at large. But the insults he endured were benign in comparison with those lobbed at the subject herself, who was described by an art critic as having a \u201csickly, grayish face, old and drawn before its time.\u201d\n\nAttitudes changed over the years, though, as is the case for so much art not appreciated in its immediate era. Degas\u2019 \u201cLittle Dancer,\u201d which the artist worked on for four years, was eventually canonized as an inflection point in art\u2019s evolution toward modernity. It was, as one critic later wrote, \u201cso original, so fearless ... truly modern.\u201d\n\nOf course, van Goethem didn\u2019t reap the benefits of this artistic triumph. Laurens found, searching through the Paris Opera\u2019s account books, that in 1882, a year after the completion of Degas\u2019 sculpture, she was incrementally docked in pay and eventually fired from her dancing post. Laurens reasoned that modeling interfered with her rehearsals until the company eventually got fed up and let her go.\n\nThere are no traces of her life after this point \u2015 no records of marriage, childbearing, arrest or death. \u201cMarie disappeared without a trace,\u201d Laurens concludes. \u201cThe little dancer flew away. Her mortal remains most likely lie not in a sepulcher but a communal grave.\u201d\n\nIn her book\u2019s final chapters, Laurens comes to a grim conclusion: \u201cIf Edgar Degas hadn\u2019t chosen Marie as his model for the Little Dancer, she would probably have stayed on at the Paris Opera. ... By sticking to dance, she would have avoided the descent into hell whose signs are all too clear.\u201d\n\nPicturenow via Getty Images As an adult, Degas fraternized with few women aside from his housekeepers. His friends believed he feared women would interfere with the quality of his work.\n\nLaurens cannot uncover exactly what transpired between Degas and van Goethem between 1878 and 1881, but she does provide a few alarming details, culled from research between 2014 and 2016. For instance, to measure van Goethem\u2019s physical proportions, Degas used a special instrument that sometimes slashed models\u2019 faces, Laurens writes. As artist Jacques-Emile Blanche said, \u201cDegas did not seduce, he frightened.\u201d\n\nWhat Laurens does state with assuredness is that van Goethem is part of an unfortunate pantheon of overlooked artistic subjects \u2015 mostly women, many children \u2015 whose value as human beings was trumped by their role as \u201cmuse.\u201d\n\nOne such woman is Linda, the pubescent subject of Pablo Picasso\u2019s 1905 \u201cFillette \u00e0 la corbeille fleurie,\u201d which sold for $115 million at auction earlier this year. Historians zealously researched the painting\u2019s provenance leading up to the sale, but details of Linda\u2019s life went unaddressed, save for the fact that she probably \u201cdied sadly young.\u201d Like van Goethem, her image was valued over her labor, her suffering and her story.\n\nLaurens\u2019 scholarship seeks to amend history\u2019s gendered bias, undoing the persistent myth that a woman\u2019s greatest accomplishment is inspiring a man\u2019s creative genius. Her objective is simple: Treat van Goethem as a human rather than a catalyst. In that sense, Little Dancer echoes Sarah Weinman\u2019s true-crime novel The Real Lolita, which tells the story of Sally Horner, whose kidnapping and rape inspired Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s infamous novel.\n\nWith Little Dancer, Laurens broaches the persistent contemporary problem: What do we do with beloved artworks with unsavory origin stories? Don\u2019t look away, Laurens urges by example. On the contrary, dig deeper into the work itself and the people who collaborated to create it. It\u2019s tempting to project fantasy onto history, casting humans as geniuses or monsters, temptresses or victims. But art history isn\u2019t as simple as canceling bad actors and celebrating unsung heroes."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Paige Lavender", "title": "Trump Thanks Saudi Arabia For Low Gas Prices After Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s Killing", "description": "Trump said Saudi Arabia is still a U.S ally, despite evidence the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the assassination of the journalist.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-saudi-arabia-oil-prices_us_5bf55699e4b0eb6d930a2d28", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf55722210000b406ca2895.jpeg?ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T13:51:09Z", "content": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday thanked Saudi Arabia for the declining price of oil, one day after he said the United States would back the country even if Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. \u201cOil pric\u2026 [+1888 chars]", "fulltext": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday thanked Saudi Arabia for the declining price of oil, one day after he said the United States would back the country even if Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\u201cOil prices getting lower.

Sometimes a successful day of parenting is seeing your kids go to bed alive, and between their now-hilarious but then-terrifying shenanigans, my constant worry, and the stress of being a litigation attorney, there came a point where it was either booze or Buddhism for me. Inebriate or meditate? Middle age is a crossroads, folks.\n\nThe practice of law isn\u2019t sexy. It\u2019s painfully boring most days, and the only good-looking attorneys are on TV. From the time I was a scrawny, tree-climbing 6-year-old, all I ever wanted to do was play outside \u2015 and yet there I was, sweating in my pantyhose, skirt pinching at my belly, and arguing with a bunch of guys in suits every day. How I became a litigation attorney is not such an interesting tale, but the \u201cunbecoming\u201d is a whopper.\n\nI\u2019d been a good, law-abiding citizen and parent, making carpooling arrangements for soccer tournaments as I hustled to court, buying cupcakes for my kids\u2019 endless stupid homeroom parties, and running from field to field with the occasional trip to the police station for venial sins involving pot and parties. I was stressed and suffocated by all the conventions I\u2019d accepted \u2015 mortgages, marriages, meetings \u2015 after vowing (as only a college kid can) that I would be a rebel \u2015 the non-conformist who took the road less traveled. Restless and unsettled, I barreled into middle age feeling the heat at my back. If I didn\u2019t change my life soon, I\u2019d be some weary old lady with a bucketful of regrets.\n\nThe wallpaper on my computer at work was a panoramic photo of a woman hiking in the Rockies. I wanted to be her, wild and free as the kid I\u2019d been, hallooing down the street on my bike and following my three brothers straight into trouble. Instead, I was listening to some boring adversary drone on during a summary judgment motion while I fantasized about riding horses through the mountains.\n\nI was stressed and suffocated by all the conventions I\u2019d accepted \u2015 mortgages, marriages, meetings... If I didn\u2019t change my life soon, I\u2019d be some weary old lady with a bucketful of regrets.\n\nI hated the aggressive ugliness of litigation; my colleagues couldn\u2019t even eat lunch without trying to one-up each other about whose sandwich was better. So, after 15 years of arguing, I left my law firm and took a job teaching high school English. A roomful of teenagers was a breath of fresh air compared to my compadres in the law. Yet, I was still exhausted and couldn\u2019t escape feeling like a magnet was pulling me to the mountains. Born and raised in Philly, with all the sassy loud-mouthed grit that city gives you, what in the name of all that is cheesesteak and \u201cyo\u201d was I doing dreaming about riding the Rockies?\n\nI can\u2019t tell you the exact moment I thought \u201cno more,\u201d but I woke up after the last day of school in my second year of teaching, called the principal, and quit. My youngest son was going into his senior year of high school and the mortgage was my only debt. It was time. Jump and the net will appear, they say, and I was ready to jump.\n\nThat same day, I booked a horse pack trip in the Rockies. Now I\u2019d done some riding in a tiny round pen on a Jersey farm, but this was cowboy stuff for sure \u2015 six days and five nights in southern Colorado, taking horses up 13,000 feet, and camping under the stars. My plan was to work that summer in a restaurant, go to the mountains, and then open a collaborative law practice when I got back. Money wasn\u2019t a driver for me, because even as an attorney, I never made that much. I hate to shop, I buy used cars and drive them for years, and I\u2019ve never accrued much debt or lived above my means. I spent money on experiences, not stuff, so I wasn\u2019t trapped by debt. But little did I know when I boarded the plane in Philly that August, my life would never be the same.\n\nCourtesy of Phyllis Coletta Phyllis rides Spike on the Colorado ranch in 2005.\n\nI was 48 years old when I packed into the Sangre de Cristo Mountains with cowboys Jake,* Rusty, and Johnny Ray. Hoo-doggie, cowboys are fun. We rode and sang and laughed over the campfire every night, drinking cowboy coffee (\u201cThat\u2019ll put hair on yer chest there, Philly girl\u201d) and stretching out in mountain meadows at night, blanketed by billions of stars. My sturdy horse held me steady in the scariest, hairiest environment I\u2019d ever seen, his beautiful head poking out over 12,000 feet on switchback turns as I clutched his mane and repeated a mantra that would itself hold me for a long time afterwards: Trust the horse. And I did \u2015 as well as the Force and the call in my soul that said I had to be a cowgirl \u2015 pretty much right away.\n\nWhen I returned to Philly, I announced to my big fat Italian family that I was quitting everything and moving to Colorado to be a cowgirl. My boys, bless them, thought it was cool, even badass. Five days after Joey graduated high school, I loaded up my remaining belongings in a Honda CRV and pointed that sucker west. I\u2019d sold my house for a crazy profit and given away most of my stuff. But driving over the Walt Whitman Bridge, to tell you the truth, I was scared as a baby calf.\n\nOut in the wilderness or pushing cattle for miles I was often afraid, and challenged: Do I ask for help? Do I run away? Colorado changed me from the inside out, like a deep cleanse \u2015 a spiritual colonoscopy.\n\nYes, I\u2019d met a cowboy on that fateful trip, and let me tell you ladies, everything you\u2019ve heard about them is true. My life with Jake is a whole other story, equal parts exhilaration and heartache, but when I headed to his 300-square-foot cabin in southern Colorado, all I knew was that I\u2019d traded my pantyhose for jeans and those wretched high heels for boots and spurs. We lived \u201coff the grid\u201d \u2015 only solar electric and no running water (unless we ran to get it) \u2015 on a 3,000-acre ranch with a herd of 50 horses. Every morning I woke to the actual purple mountains majesty, the Sangres turning soft in the dawn. I worked outside, taking \u201cdudes\u201d (like me) out on pack trips or teaching them how to rock climb, hike and mountain bike. I toiled on ranches doing stuff I had no business doing with horses and trucks, and I\u2019m now in a pretty small club of women who have argued before appellate courts and branded cattle. \u201cLife is an adventure or nothing at all,\u201d Hellen Keller said, and I had finally found more than my share of adventure.\n\nThis was all more than a decade ago, and my life has taken many stunning turns since then. Jake and I married, but five years ago he filed for divorce. Then a month after that, I got breast cancer. Here\u2019s what I learned on the ranch, and what kept me steady as I lost my marriage, home, job, sense of self, and some body parts: From epic mountain hailstorms to black bears and bulls, nature is strong and beautiful and can carry us through anything. We are \u2015 all of us \u2015 tougher than we think. I went to Colorado to test my mettle, to get to know my own power \u2015 which had nothing to do with my lawyer smarts or Jersey tough girl persona. I\u2019m grateful that marriage and the mountains kicked my ass because I needed to wake up. Every day on that ranch I learned that it\u2019s all either fear or love, and I had to lean into both. I guess I wanted to feel brave.\n\nOut in the wilderness or pushing cattle for miles I was often afraid, and challenged: Do I ask for help? Do I run away? Can I ride that mare across the pasture, or that mountain bike up an impossible single-track? Colorado changed me from the inside out, like a deep cleanse \u2015 a spiritual colonoscopy. I don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s in store for me now, but I\u2019m finally standing on my own two feet. It only took five decades, but it\u2019s totally worth the wait.\n\nCourtesy of Phyllis Coletta Phyllis embracing the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in 2005.\n\nWhen I\u2019d be out all day pushing cattle, the cowboys would give me a hard time when I had to pee. \u201cCome on Philly girl,\u201d they\u2019d say, \u201cwe\u2019re burning daylight!\u201d And ain\u2019t that the truth? Life is short, and so sweet, and every moment you\u2019re not living your authentic life, you\u2019re burning daylight. If you\u2019ve got a calling in your soul \u2015 no matter what it looks like \u2015 maybe it\u2019s time to live that one real life that\u2019s been following you like a shadow. Here\u2019s the most important thing I learned when I felt alone and exposed in the wilderness or even in my marriage: An aspen grove looks like a multitude of individual trees, but it\u2019s really one big organism, all connected to one root, just like us. We\u2019re not free-standing loners in solitude. We help each other grow, and like an aspen grove, we\u2019re all connected at the root.\n\n*Not his real name\n\nPhyllis Coletta is a recovering lawyer now living in Seattle.

Never before did a state have to address the challenges of a near 100 percent failure of its power grid, water systems and communications infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThese challenges, he added, had been exacerbated by the financial debt crisis facing the territory.\n\nAccording to a report published in Axios earlier this month, President Donald Trump was considering cutting off federal relief money to Puerto Rico because of a belief, unsupported by any evidence, that the Puerto Rican government was mishandling relief funding and using it to pay off its debts.\n\nIn his letter to Congress, Rossello did not address this report directly but stressed that his administration had \u201cworked diligently to ensure full compliance, robust transparency, and accountability in our utilization of federal disaster assistance.\u201d \u201cWe have made clear that federal recovery money should only be used to help Puerto Rico rebuild and recover from the hurricane and not address other fiscal and infrastructure challenges,\u201d he added.\n\nRossello accused Congress and federal agencies of treating \u201cus differently than other U.S. citizens on the mainland\u201d and holding the territory at a \u201chigher standard.\u201d\n\n\u201cFEMA and the Administration put in place burdensome financial procedures that had never been used for any State or Territory before,\u201d he wrote.\n\nA\u00fan bajo estas circunstancias, tanto el Congreso como las agencias federales han requerido de Puerto Rico requisitos m\u00e1s exigentes que los que se les exigen a los dem\u00e1s estados y territorios.

(And, to be perfectly clear, not just any president and Congress, but a president and Congress willing to meet the purity standard that immigration advocates often push, asking for \u201cclean\u201d legislation that meets their demands and derailing bipartisan negotiations that could actually yield sensible legislation.)\n\nBut we shouldn\u2019t have to wait. Immigrants and their advocates have an opportunity now to devise an approach that allows for an actual negotiation between Republicans and Democrats \u2015 perhaps in the form of a bipartisan compromise that allows a segment of the immigrant population (like Dreamers and TPS holders) to be set free from constant deportation fears via legislation that grants them a pathway toward legal permanent residency and eventual citizenship.\n\nThis would be no easy feat. But since when has anything dealing with immigration policy, at any level of government, been easy?\n\nNow, I am by no means advocating that Democrats agree to fully fund Trump\u2019s ridiculous border wall, nor am I willing to sell out my values as a progressive and change agent. But if the GOP is insisting on more funding for DHS\u2019 deportation and immigration enforcement operations, then Democrats might as well ask for something just as valuable in return.\n\nImmigrants and their advocates with political networks, public profiles and relationships on Capitol Hill can\u2019t claim to be the sole gatekeepers of the collective opinions and voices of all undocumented immigrants, Dreamers and TPS holders. That is why it is our duty to pursue any strategy or opening to enact legislation to protect immigrant communities \u2015 even if it doesn\u2019t encompass everything we want.\n\nImmigrants who have to work, go to school and are unable to remain involved in Congress\u2019 constantly shuffling immigration debates are eagerly waiting for something, anything, to give their lives and future in this country some sense of certainty. To pass on an opportunity to negotiate relief for a segment of our immigrant community, especially under such a disastrous administration, would be a disservice to the people we advocate for on a regular basis.\n\nThis is why the immigrant rights movement cannot set red lines before sensible Republicans and Democrats even start negotiations on Dreamer or TPS legislation. Yes, Trump and the GOP have sunk several deals, acted in bad faith and been unfair in their demands for immigration legislation. But Democrats cannot admit defeat and refuse to try again for compromise and instead hope for a future scenario that may never come to pass.\n\nIf there\u2019s a conversation that could lead to a breakthrough deal on immigration policy for Dreamers and TPS holders, then our allies deserve to hear it \u2015 even if nothing comes of it. Because waiting for the perfect deal or perfect conditions to pass any meaningful reform (while Trump uses the judicial system to undermine our victories) will leave millions of immigrants sitting with the same fear and anxiety they\u2019ve experienced for years. And that is not a path to victory for anyone."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Eric Sullivan", "title": "Air Pollution Is Killing Kids, But Trump's EPA Doesn't Seem To Care", "description": "Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler is setting future doctors like me up for failure.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-epa-pollution-health_us_5bf41da3e4b01909c809a8f5", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf43676220000da05de3e87.jpeg?cache=wssf6mkgys&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T11:00:01Z", "content": "As a fourth-year medical student and future family medicine provider, I have a moral obligation as does any doctor to keep my current and future patients healthy and thriving.

It\u2019s for that reason I must speak out against acting Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler\u2019s pending proposal, misleadingly named the \u201cAffordable Clean Energy Rule,\u201d to dismantle the Obama-era 2015 Clean Power Plan, which set the first and only federal limits on carbon pollution from power plants.\n\nI\u2019ve seen firsthand how air pollution harms our communities\u2019 most vulnerable populations. During my pediatrics rotation last year, half of the patients on our ward were young children with asthma from Chicago\u2019s South Side. Some of these kids had been to the hospital so many times they\u2019d lost track, rushed by their parents into the emergency room when they could barely breathe.\n\nWe were thankfully able to successfully treat these children, but their terrifying experiences left a lasting impression on me, and I continue to be deeply troubled by the knowledge that a large number of my cases could\u2019ve been prevented if these kids only had cleaner air to breathe. Study after study has shown the connection between dirty air and asthma exacerbations and that improving air quality has a clear and positive impact on children\u2019s health.\n\nDuring my pediatrics rotation last year, half of the patients on our ward were young children with asthma from Chicago\u2019s South Side. Some of these kids had been to the hospital so many times they\u2019d lost track.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s proposed ACE Rule doesn\u2019t set limits on how many tons of carbon existing coal-fired power plants can emit. Emission standards, set by individual states, would instead be based on making coal-fired power plants somewhat more efficient without specifying any actual emissions targets. This rule will consequently fail to achieve any meaningful reduction in the amount of pollution coming from these power plants. In fact, it could actually increase total pollution if coal-fired power plants that improve their efficiency were to run more frequently.\n\nUltimately, the EPA plans to allow old, failing coal plants that should be shut down entirely to continue operating, thus emitting more dangerous carbon pollution into our air. And this will disproportionately harm the more than 26 million Americans with asthma \u2013 including 6 million children. Indeed, the EPA\u2019s own analysis of its own rule concluded ACE could result in up to 1,400 more premature deaths, 48,000 more asthma exacerbations and at least 21,000 missed days of school annually by 2030. And the EPA doesn\u2019t even attempt to address this discrepancy.\n\nWin McNamee via Getty Images Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler testifies before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on Aug. 1, 2018.\n\nOne of the very first lessons a medical student learns when you get your white coat is the Hippocratic oath, which includes the promise to \u201cdo no harm.\u201d And while Wheeler isn\u2019t a doctor, the agency he heads similarly states that its mission is \u201cto protect human health and the environment\u201d \u2013 a mission that\u2019s explicitly undermined by this new proposed rule.\n\nWhen children come into the emergency room in the midst of a severe asthma attack, the scene is uniformly terrifying: chests heaving, eyes bulging and tiny neck muscles straining, all to get just an ounce more air into their lungs. The ACE Rule will ensure these events don\u2019t just continue to happen but that they will increase, and it will be up to those of us in the medical profession to mitigate the EPA\u2019s mistakes. But doctors aren\u2019t perfect, and we will inevitably fail at some point to reopen a child\u2019s airway. The death of even one additional child due to this ill-informed policy will be not just a tragedy but a callous and preventable crime.\n\nThe EPA is currently reviewing comments submitted on its proposal. The timing for a final, official rule is uncertain, but will most likely come in mid- or late 2019. I implore the EPA to carefully review the input provided by groups like Physicians for Social Responsibility and the American Lung Association.\n\nThe death of even one additional child due to this ill-informed policy will be not just a tragedy but a callous and preventable crime.\n\nACE is neither clean nor affordable. It will increase rather than decrease the amount of pollutants in the air \u2015 pollutants that will inevitably lead to greater adverse health effects and their attendant costs. And it will only exacerbate climate change, slow the transition to cleaner, safer energy sources, and cost thousands of lives.\n\nAs the federal government attempts to undermine our critical environmental and health laws, we can and must take action at the state and local level, pushing leaders to fill the void by putting strong climate and clean energy policies in place so we can finally get a handle on the growing climate emergency.\n\nThe American people deserve an EPA that is focused on its stated mission, and that starts with Wheeler and the Trump administration strengthening lifesaving health and climate protections like the Clean Power Plan, not gutting them.

Satellite images showed gigantic plumes of smoke billowing from the blazes, and it didn\u2019t take long for much of this smoke to settle ominously over densely populated cities like Oakland, San Francisco and San Jose.\n\nThe thick haze shrouding the Bay Area has produced air quality indices surpassing 200 \u2015 a level designated as \u201cvery unhealthy\u201d by the Environmental Protection Agency and on a par with notably polluted cities like Delhi and Beijing.\n\nRecord-breaking levels of toxic particulate matter have prompted air quality warnings leading to the mass closure of schools in the region and the cancellation of many outdoor events. Public health officials have recommended staying indoors or, for those who must venture out, wearing N95-rated particulate-filtering air masks.\n\nFor homeless people, the problem is particularly stark. \u201cPeople living outside are already exposed to pollution and smog at a much higher rate than the average person,\u201d said Williams. \u201cBut imagine adding on top of that an air quality index of 200-plus and no escape.\u201d\n\nThe Bay Area\u2019s housing shortage has hit epidemic proportions over the last few years, and municipalities have not been able to provide adequate services for those pushed out onto the streets. San Francisco alone is home to around 7,500 homeless people, for whom remaining indoors or purchasing costly masks is often not possible.\n\nAuthorities have also not been able to adequately address the current air quality crisis.\n\nDuring the 2017 Northern California Firestorm, Williams and Redwoods bought and distributed 4,000 N95 air masks. At the time, it seemed like a lot. But it turned out to be nothing compared to what they have accomplished in the last two weeks.\n\nSince the Camp fire started on Nov. 8, Mask Oakland said it has collected and distributed more than 85,000 masks. Most were purchased through wholesale suppliers with money donated directly by individuals. Those masks have made a huge difference for thousands of people. But they\u2019re still just fulfilling a fraction of the overall need.\n\n\u201cJust to keep up with this last week of constantly awful air quality, since the masks are disposable, we would need something like 500,000 masks,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSo, our numbers are big \u2014 and they\u2019re bigger than any other entity right now by far \u2015 but they\u2019re still only a drop in the bucket for the actual need that exists in this area.\u201d\n\nWilliams and Redwoods distribute a lot of masks themselves, but they have also partnered with a team of volunteers and other organizations to spread their reach.\n\nDale Smith is an organizer with the San Francisco chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, one of the groups partnering with Mask Oakland. His organization has distributed thousands of masks both from their offices in San Francisco and through mobile distribution.\n\n{\\__/}\n\n( \u2022 - \u2022)\n\n\ud83c\udfad\u207f\u2079\u2075 < \\ u want this?\n\n\n\n{\\__/}\n\n( \u2022 . \u2022)\n\n/ >\ud83c\udfad\u207f\u2079\u2075 ok \u2014 DSA San Francisco (@DSA_SF) November 19, 2018\n\n\u201cWe definitely scaled up our mask distribution thanks to Mask Oakland,\u201d Smith told HuffPost. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have been able to find the amount of masks that we were able to distribute without them.\u201d\n\nMuch of the labor around mask distribution is being done by groups that have a great deal of experience working among the most marginalized communities in the Bay Area. This is true of Williams and Redwoods as well.\n\nDSASF A member of the Democratic Socialists of America distributes masks outside City Hall in San Francisco.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trans and disabled,\u201d Redwoods said. \u201cLife is not easy when the smoke lifts for pretty much any of the people who volunteer for Mask Oakland.\u201d\n\nWilliams is no stranger to systemic adversity either. \u201cI\u2019ve been houseless myself too,\u201d she said. \u201cBut grateful that I had a network of people to keep me under a roof.\u201d\n\nLast year, the farm where Williams worked was burned down in the Northern California Firestorm. She was left unemployed and in a precarious state \u2014 a condition familiar to many of Mask Oakland\u2019s volunteers.\n\nTheir own experiences have left Williams and Redwoods with an acute awareness of the housing and homelessness problems in the Bay Area. It\u2019s this awareness that has prompted them, despite their own difficulties, to devote so much time and energy to helping vulnerable people.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been part of the climate and environmental justice movement since at least 2008,\u201d Redwoods said. \u201cSo I have an understanding of the invisible impact of pollution on the body. There are thousands of people stuck outside in horrendous conditions all over California. If you have capacity to help those with less, you must.\u201d\n\nThe kinds of grassroots, community-based efforts organized by Mask Oakland and others will likely continue to play a crucial role in addressing people\u2019s needs as wildfires and other disasters unfold globally. But those efforts can only go so far. State, county and municipal agencies could be doing much more to address the impact of poor air quality on the Bay Area\u2019s unhoused population. San Francisco is the richest metropolitan area in the U.S. and yet the city\u2019s Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing has distributed only around 1,600 masks.\n\nAs well as working to raise awareness about the need for air masks in the Bay Area, the San Francisco chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America has also been a loud voice demanding more action from the city.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re out here filling the gap and doing more than the city is doing \u2014 and possibly could do \u2014 because they\u2019re just not prepared to deal with this stuff,\u201d said Smith. \u201cI do electoral work too, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s going to take regular people working together to solve issues.\u201d\n\nMichael Short/Bloomberg via Getty Images A man wearing a mask walks past a sleeping homeless person on Nov. 15 in San Francisco.\n\nRandolph Quezada, a spokesman for San Francisco\u2019s homeless services department, told HuffPost, \u201cEnsuring the health and safety of people experiencing homelessness has been and will continue to be our focus.\u201d In addition to the masks, he said that 700 bottles of water have been distributed and 75 additional mats \u2015 essentially places to sleep \u2015 have been added to the shelter system.\n\nThat\u2019s nowhere near enough, activists say. \u201cThere is no excuse for why a group of largely disabled and marginalized volunteers are providing all of this unpaid labor,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe city and the county have got the money. Why don\u2019t they at least purchase the masks and let our amazing network of volunteers and our collaborative efforts help to get them out to the people?\u201d\n\nWith rain in the forecast this week, helping to douse the Camp fire with water and push much of the smoke out of the Bay Area, it\u2019s looking like air quality will improve. But with wildfires predicted to keep burning longer, faster, and hotter in California, the need for disaster preparedness and municipal accountability is greater than ever.\n\nFor more content and to be part of the \u201cThis New World\u201d community, follow our Facebook page."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Melissa Hung", "title": "America Is Ignoring A Huge Part Of Trump's Crackdown On Immigrants", "description": "The deportation of Southeast Asian immigrants is often overlooked.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/southeast-asian-immigrant-deportation_us_5bf43252e4b0d9e7283d855f", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf4349624000039045836c4.jpeg?cache=vzdprguec2&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T10:45:03Z", "content": "President Donald Trump s demonization of Central American migrants took center stage ahead of the midterm elections.

And then suddenly, out of the blue one day, ICE just swoops into your house and cuffs you.\u201d\n\nWhile these types of deportations have taken place for decades, they increased in 2010 under the Obama administration and have skyrocketed recently under the Trump administration. Raids, detentions and deportations targeting Southeast Asian-American communities have surged since the fall of 2017, following the U.S. government\u2019s placement of visa sanctions on Cambodia and three other countries.\n\nPrasad estimates that three to four times as many Cambodian immigrants are now being swept up in ICE raids than in prior years. The San Francisco and Los Angeles chapters of Advancing Justice, together with the law firm Sidley Austin LLP, filed a federal class action lawsuit last year contending that the arrests are unlawful.\n\nIn October 2017, ICE carried out the biggest raid ever on Cambodian-American communities, advocates say, rounding up more than 100 people nationwide over the course of two weeks.\n\nA few weeks later, ICE targeted Vietnamese refugees. Although a signed agreement between the U.S. and Vietnam restricts who can be deported \u2014 only those who arrived in the U.S. on or after July 12, 1995, the day after the normalization of relations between the two countries \u2014 about a dozen Vietnamese refugees who arrived before 1995 were deported last year, according to Mariategue.\n\n\u201cI definitely think a theme of this administration is to deport as many people as possible,\u201d she said.\n\nThere have been similar raids on Somali, Haitian, Cuban and Iraqi Christian immigrant communities as well, Prasad said. \u201cThey\u2019re using sanctions and threatening foreign aid in a way in which other administrations would have said, \u2018This isn\u2019t our biggest diplomatic issue with this other country. We\u2019re not going to alienate this country over a fairly minor policy issue.\u2019 But in the Trump administration, it seems like it\u2019s inverted.\u201d\n\nJohn Moore via Getty Images ICE officers arrest a man during a raid in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nThere seems to be no rhyme or reason to who ICE arrests. It\u2019s a mix of people with convictions that are a few years old and others that are decades old. It\u2019s people with minor convictions and serious ones, people with families supporting children and those without.\n\n\u201cIt really seems completely arbitrary. There is this heightened sense of fear now that people see the raids are picking up,\u201d Prasad said.\n\nChamroeun Phan was detained at an ICE check-in in 2016 for an old crime he had served time for: breaking three windows at a bar. Phan\u2019s family had fled the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia. He was born in a refugee camp in Thailand and resettled in the United States when he was a child.\n\nBy the time of his detainment, he had a 4-year-old daughter. The family was given only five minutes to say their goodbyes while separated by a window, his sister Montha Chum recalled. She remembers her niece holding up her hand to her father\u2019s against the window before they were forced to leave.\n\nChum and others started the #ReleaseMN8 campaign to advocate for Phan and seven other Minnesota men who were slated for deportation to Cambodia. After a year in detention, Phan was one of the few released. Five of the men were deported.\n\nPhan\u2019s detainment taxed the family emotionally and financially. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to pay off credit cards I used to support my brother while he was in detention,\u201d Chum said in a report released by SEARAC on the effects of detention and deportation on women and families from Southeast Asia. Phone calls cost 45 cents a minute, she said, but she had to make them. \u201cWhen you speak to them, it helps them keep their sanity, that they can hear their loved ones\u2019 voices,\u201d Chum explained.\n\nThe experience of fighting for Phan also re-traumatized their parents, bringing up painful memories of the genocide and family separation.\n\n\u201cWe see a lot of parents who are survivors of genocide \u2014 and quite elderly \u2014 going through pronounced periods of depression and re-triggering of post-traumatic stress disorder,\u201d Prasad said. \u201cWe see the children having really serious behavioral issues at school and starting to get in trouble. I know some of them have entered into the criminal system themselves after their parents were deported.\u201d\n\nI definitely think a theme of this administration is to deport as many people as possible. Katrina Dizon Mariategue, Southeast Asia Resource Action Center\n\nThis focus on deporting immigrants and refugees with past criminal convictions without considering their rehabilitation is \u201ca simplistic approach\u201d that \u201cdoesn\u2019t look into the underlying issues about why certain communities have higher incarceration rates,\u201d Prasad said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look into the experience of refugee communities and mental health issues and poverty.\u201d\n\nTraumatized by war and resettled into impoverished communities with little understanding of American culture, many Southeast Asian refugees went down difficult paths. \u201cFor a lot of our community members who came as refugees, they resettled into the United States without a lot of adequate support. They fell through the cracks of the criminal justice system at young ages,\u201d SEARAC\u2019s Mariategue said.\n\nThongsy\u2019s family was torn apart when the U.S. bombed Laos in what is considered one of the heaviest bombardments in history. His sister died from lack of medical care during the war. His mother and older brother fled, leaving behind his father, who had a mental illness and could not flee. Thongsy was born in a refugee camp in Thailand in 1979. In 1981, his family was resettled in Stockton, California, in a neighborhood rife with violence, drugs and gang activity. Like other refugees, they got green cards, but lacking language skills and resources, they couldn\u2019t navigate the complex process of obtaining U.S. citizenship.\n\nThongsy\u2019s mother remarried. His stepfather was verbally and physically abusive. \u201cBecause of war trauma, he would drink,\u201d Thongsy said of his stepfather. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t know other ways to ask for help or to cope with it.\u201d\n\nIcon Sportswire via Getty Images Protesters hold up signs demanding the abolition of ICE and recalling the ordeal of refugees under the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia.\n\nBullied by others, Thongsy started hanging out with other refugee kids from similarly dysfunctional families. At the age of 12, they were drinking, getting high and breaking into cars. When Thongsy was 17 years old, his older brother was shot in the head by gang members outside a convenience store and run over. The murder of his brother sent him into a downward spiral. \u201cAfter his passing, I didn\u2019t know how to deal with the trauma.\u201d\n\nOne night, Thongsy and a friend ran into a group of three people on the street. Recognizing one of them as having fought with his brother, he opened fire, killing one of them and injuring the other two. A month later, he turned himself in. Thongsy took a plea bargain and was sentenced to 27 years to life.\n\nWhile incarcerated, he started going to church and became a born-again Christian. He enrolled in classes, obtained his GED and then a college degree in social sciences, and began facilitating self-help groups and mentoring other prisoners. After 20 years, he was granted parole but was immediately transferred to immigration prison for deportation proceedings. After two months, in February 2017, he was released under an order of supervision with a regular check-in with ICE.\n\nWhen HuffPost spoke to him, he had just had an ICE check-in three days earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s a scary feeling because you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to come out from there or not, if you\u2019re going to get detained and sent to a country where you don\u2019t know the culture or language.\u201d He has no family left in Laos.\n\nThongsy\u2019s only hope now is to receive a pardon from California\u2019s governor, which would allow him to ask for his deportation order to be re-opened. Advancing Justice - ALC is advocating for Thongsy and others in similar situations to receive pardons. The group recently co-sponsored a state bill, AB 2845, with Assemblymember Rob Bonta to improve the transparency of California\u2019s pardon and commutation process. (Currently, petitioners who apply have no way of knowing if their request was received or reviewed.) Gov. Jerry Brown (D) signed the legislation in September."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Arthur Delaney", "title": "Meet The Dollar Store Resistance", "description": "Low-end retailers undercut independent grocers and small-town aesthetics, but some locals are fighting back.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dollar-stores-small-town-businesses_us_5beefe6ae4b0f7192ca9342e", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5be5f3763c00008e030eb77e.jpeg?cache=ago4fjkosl&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T10:45:02Z", "content": "ROCK HALL, Md.

But Carroll didn\u2019t see how a hometown boy such as himself could compete with a faraway corporation\u2019s weirdly low prices on things like bread and milk.\n\n\n\nHe pleaded with the town planning commission, arguing that Rock Hall\u2019s 2011 \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d says local firms are key to the town\u2019s success.\n\n\n\n\u201cI presented my case and re-read the comprehensive plan several times, and they just totally ignored me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey went to take a vote, and I stood up and said, \u2018What about me?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nSo Carroll hired a lawyer to appeal the permit and circulated a petition that garnered more than 600 signatures. And in so doing, Carroll joined the Dollar Store Resistance \u2015 a plucky little movement that barely exists, can\u2019t win, but, by God, it tries.\n\n\n\nDollar stores are popping up all over the country, outnumbering McDonald\u2019s restaurants and Walmart supercenters combined. The low-cost stores are part of a broader transformation of the American retail landscape, which recently has seen the demise of malls and the rise of Amazon\u2019s home delivery service.\n\n\n\nAnd they\u2019re a part of an even bigger, longer, sadder trend: the decline of local business. In the 1980s, independent retailers sold half the goods bought in U.S. stores, but by 2012 the independent share of sales had fallen to about a quarter, according to the Institute for Local Self Reliance, a national think tank that advocates for preserving local economic power.\n\n\n\nOnce or twice every month, someone from a small town reaches out to ILSR for help confronting a dollar store development, said Stacy Mitchell, the group\u2019s director. Laws vary by state, and there\u2019s usually not much that can be done. But Mitchell said there\u2019s a familiar pattern for what happens after the store opens: If the town already has a grocery, that store will lose roughly 30 percent of its business.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe problem is, an independent grocer, because margins are small, losing that 30 percent often puts them in the red and they don\u2019t have any resources to draw on,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThere\u2019s only so long a grocery store can hold on losing money.\u201d\n\n\n\nDollar stores, by contrast, are owned by giant, profitable corporations with annual sales in the tens of billions.\n\n\n\n\u201cA Dollar General \u2015 they can lose money at that new store for a year, two years, until that local grocer closes,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t compete with the grocery part: the toilet paper, the paper good aisle, trash bags, the detergent aisle, snack food, canned vegetables. Lonnie Lisai, independent grocer in Chester, Vermont\n\nA recent Department of Agriculture analysis found that from 2007 to 2015, the overall number of grocery stores in the U.S. increased, but the share of stores that were independent declined from around 46 percent to 43 percent, with independents responsible for only 11 percent of retail food sales. Since they\u2019re technically not groceries, dollar stores were excluded from the analysis, meaning it understates the decline of independent food retailers.\n\nDollar stores are grocery stores. They feed more people than Whole Foods does, Mitchell said, citing her own analysis of federal consumer spending data. There\u2019s usually no fresh produce, but you can get cheap packs of bacon, cans of soup or Velveeta cheese slices without having to drive to a giant facility.\n\nThere are two main dollar brands: Dollar General and Dollar Tree, which also owns Family Dollar. While Dollar Tree exclusively sells items that cost only $1, Family Dollar and Dollar General offer more expensive items. They share essentially the same business model. A core part of their strategy is that their stores are cheap to build and easy to shop in because they\u2019re small, bright and rarely situated on remote highways.\n\nIn their disclosures to investors, both Dollar General and Dollar Tree use the word \u201ccompelling\u201d to describe the dollar shopping experience. Because the stores are so small \u2015 typically less than 10,000 square feet \u2015 it\u2019s easy for customers to walk in, grab what they need and walk back out.\n\nThe key advantage over locally owned competition is that dollar stores have their own distribution networks, just like Amazon and Walmart. Being able to buy on a larger scale means dollar stores can sell products at a far lower price than a smaller retailer can get from its wholesalers. Dollar General operates 15 warehouses around the country and is currently constructing two more. In addition to hiring third-party trucking firms, it has its own fleet of trucks that deliver goods to its nearly 15,000 stores. It opened 1,300 new locations last year and had planned for 900 more this year, mostly in rural towns with fewer than 20,000 residents.\n\nThe epicenter of the dollar store resistance might be Chester, Vermont, where residents\u2019 fight against dollar stores made The New York Times in 2012. They were able to fend off Dollar General until 2016, citing local regulations designed up uphold the town\u2019s \u201ccharacter.\u201d Other Vermont towns have made use of a special state law that allows residents to appeal development projects to regional boards. Vermont has been a beacon to other small towns confronting the spread of low-end retail.\n\n\u201cI still get calls from other states, but our laws are so different it\u2019s hard to give anybody advice,\u201d said Shawn Cunningham, a local activist.\n\nChester\u2019s local grocery store adapted by shifting its inventory and letting go some part-time workers, said proprietor Lonnie Lisai. The store lost about 10 percent of its business.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t compete with the grocery part: the toilet paper, the paper good aisle, trash bags, the detergent aisle, snack food, canned vegetables,\u201d Lisai said. \u201cHowever, it did make us a better store by readjusting our marketing strategy by doing more produce, more dairy, more meats and fresh produce.\u201d\n\nIn Joshua Tree, California, a coalition of local business owners and residents sued San Bernardino County over its approval of a Dollar Store development in 2013. They were ultimately rebuffed by an appeals court in 2016, but Celeste Doyle, owner of an outdoor supply store, said the Dollar General still hasn\u2019t materialized. She hopes it stays away.\n\n\u201cThey would definitely degrade the community and take away from the panache, the gestalt that makes it less of why most people moved here for,\u201d she said.\n\nSometimes dollar stores are beaten decisively. Earlier this year, the town council in Buhler, Kansas, voted against a Dollar General after seeing a local food market run out of business by a dollar store in nearby Haven. And the City Council in Tulsa, Oklahoma, enacted zoning restrictions to prevent new dollar stores from opening.\n\nThe fights can pit different constituencies against each other. Rock Hall Mayor Brian Jones, who was a member of the town council in 2013, said the strongest opposition to the Dollar General came from newer residents who moved to Rock Hall for its marinas and quiet bayfront property.\n\n\u201cThey moved here from cities and towns that already had this stuff, and that\u2019s the last thing they wanted to see,\u201d Jones said. Many longtime residents, on the other hand, are just happy to be able to buy things cheaply.\n\nRock Hall has a population of about 1,200 with a significant number of households that are second homes for people who live here only part of the year. With vintage homes lining its two biggest roads and a tiny commercial area on Main Street, the town is pleasant but not aggressively quaint. Bayside Foods is on the corner of Main and Rock Hall Avenue.\n\nJeff Carroll\u2019s challenge to Rock Hall\u2019s building permit lost in court, and the town\u2019s leaders seemingly did share the town activists\u2019 antipathy for dollar stores. The Dollar General opened in November 2013 across the avenue from Bayside Foods. It\u2019s set back from the road between a chain boating retailer and a Pasta Plus, and it doesn\u2019t seem to detract much from Rock Hall\u2019s local panache.\n\nArthur Delaney The Dollar General in Rock Hall, Maryland.\n\nBayside is still open, but Carroll said he\u2019s lost 30 percent of his business and has reduced his staff from 42 to 25. He no longer offers health insurance or retirement benefits for those who remain.\n\nCarroll said the Dollar General employs six people, with four of them working part time. (Slim staffing with low pay is another key part of the dollar store strategy.)\n\nDollar General declined to specify how many workers it has in Rock Hall but said its stores generally have six to 10 employees.\n\n\u201cWhen we open a new location, we carefully consider how best to meet the needs of our customers, while being respectful of community concerns,\u201d the company said in a statement (attributed to no one in particular). \u201cDollar General offers everyday low prices, value and convenience on quality products; qualities that customers across America are looking for as they look for ways to stretch their budgets.\u201d\n\nOn a Friday in October, the Rock Hall Dollar General had cheaper coffee grounds, cheaper milk and far cheaper canned goods than Bayside Foods had to offer. Bayside had competitive prices on bacon and bread, but Carroll said the discounts he offered for those items made them unprofitable.\n\nBayside had the charm of a local shop, with a butcher, deli and a bakery where people could sit and wait for their orders. The Dollar General had the charm of a prefabricated box store, albeit a small one. What it lacked in food options it made up for with other items, like belts, Budweiser hats and plastic tubs. Several customers said they also shopped at Bayside, especially if they needed something like fresh meat. For that reason, they seemed unconcerned that Bayside might be in an unfair fight.\n\nCarroll is unsure how much longer Rock Hall can support both Dollar General and his local market. The town native said he returned in the early 2000s to be his own boss after having spent a career working for Acme Markets in Pennsylvania.\n\nHe is unsure how much longer he wants to keep working \u2015 at 63, he\u2019s had both hips replaced and underwent back surgery on Tuesday. Before we had lunch in October, he went home to retrieve a pain pill. When we arrived at Waterman\u2019s Crab House, Carroll said, \u201cThis is the end of the road,\u201d because the road literally ended at the water. He was making a point about how tiny the town is. But it kind of seemed like he was talking about himself.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to compete,\u201d he said."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Lee Moran", "title": "Obama \u2018Crashes\u2019 Chicago Food Bank To Help Out For Thanksgiving", "description": "President Donald Trump, meanwhile, flew to his private Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-food-bank-chicago-thanksgiving_us_5bf52054e4b03b230f9cda96", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf5228a2400006f0499ba60.png?cache=BtfLaC5rDV&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T10:34:42Z", "content": "Former President Barack Obama lent a helping hand at a food bank in Chicago on Tuesday.

Alessandro Serenelli, a young man who lived near her family in the Italian town of Le Ferriere, had been pestering her for sex for some time, and had decided to kill her if she refused again. Though he threatened her with a 10-inch awl, she continued to resist, yelling \u201cGod does not wish it!,\u201d even as he began to stab her.\n\nShe died of her injuries a day later. Serenelli later confirmed that he had not penetrated her \u2015 you know, aside from the 14 stab wounds he inflicted on her with the awl. In short, upon her death, Maria remained a virgin. In 1950, she was sainted.\n\nThere is, in truth, no shortage of girls and women who have been murdered by sexually predatory men. What set Maria Goretti apart was that she had successfully defended her hymen with her life. She became a patron saint of rape victims, who, ironically, was never a victim of rape.\n\nIn my Catholic high school, in the early aughts, St. Maria was a role model. Some other Catholic school alumni I\u2019ve spoken to in recent weeks also remember her chaste figure from their studies \u2015 a popular subject for dress-up-as-a-saint days. She died at middle-school age, making her a perpetual peer of adolescents. \u201cOften [a Confirmation name] was chosen because of a saint you really admired,\u201d remembered a woman who went to school in St. Louis, Missouri. \u201cMaria, for Maria Goretti, was by far one of the most popular Confirmation names.\u201d\n\nMy school went so far as to name our chastity club after her, the St. Maria Goretti Club, which the theology faculty encouraged students to join. At that age \u2015 a prickly but impressionable teenager \u2015 I should have been low-hanging fruit for such a club. I was a virgin (both by choice and by circumstance, the circumstance being that no one was asking), and I planned to remain so until marriage (even if, hopefully, someone did start asking). A decade of Catholic schooling had stuffed me full of doctrine and values, and I eagerly rationalized positions I\u2019d later come to find repellent. I believed that faith in God demanded sacrifice, even martyrdom. I believed that protecting innocent life might mean carrying a child to term even if it endangered me, even if the pregnancy was the result of a rape, because that baby hadn\u2019t chosen to hurt me.\n\nBut a chastity club named after an 11-year-old girl who was murdered by a sexual predator \u2015 the very concept broke something in my faith. To me, the chastity club was an overstep, a slip-up that tugged the veil off the Gothic underbelly of Catholic womanhood. I couldn\u2019t fathom why the church would encourage me to die rather than allow a penis into my vagina.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t about protecting innocents, or making virtuous personal choices, I thought; it was a near-complete conflation of women\u2019s intact hymens and our goodness, a value system in which I would be preferred dead rather than a rape survivor.\n\nThe Brett Kavanaugh/Christine Blasey Ford hearings, steeped in invocations of pious Catholic boyhood and plausibly deniable misbehavior, raised a lot of ghosts for American women. I didn\u2019t expect any ghosts to be raised for me; I\u2019ve been lucky to never experience anything like what Blasey Ford did that night in 1982. But when she recalled the laughter at her expense \u2015 \u201cindelible in the hippocampus\u201d \u2015 and the hand over her mouth as two boys attacked her, the images felt familiar somehow.\n\nAfter a childhood of Sunday mornings spent at Mass and school days with regular prayer time, the first time that I really became conscious of the hatred for women encoded in Christian tradition was in middle school. A family friend gave me a little white leather Bible with gold-edged pages for my confirmation, a milestone meant to signal your considered adult decision to enter the church. High on my new religious maturity, I decided to read a chapter of the Lord\u2019s Word every night \u2015 not Bible stories for children, but the Book itself.\n\nGrowing up female and Catholic often means internalizing, or at least conveniently ignoring, a millennia-old edifice of anti-woman doctrine, scripture and lore.\n\nI expected transcendence, but stumbled, as if through a wrong passageway, into horror. Those Bible stories for kids\u2019 anthologies, I quickly realized, had skipped over or heavily edited tales of casual brutality toward and sexual exploitation of women, and the laws that enabled it. In Deuteronomy, for example, I learned that if a man rapes a betrothed virgin in the country, the man should be killed for denying another man his promised bride. If he does so in town, the woman must die too; she didn\u2019t scream loudly enough for rescue, so she must have been complicit. I remember reading that passage vividly \u2015 the tissue-thin page, the matter-of-fact words, my queasy confusion.\n\nNow, thinking of Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s story of struggling with her assaulter\u2019s hand clamped over her mouth as their friends partied nearby, I understand. If a woman\u2019s cry for help is stifled and no one hears it, the rape itself can be erased, or it can become something else entirely: a shared sin, a mutual encounter.\n\nGrowing up female and Catholic often means internalizing, or at least conveniently ignoring, a millennia-old edifice of anti-woman doctrine, scripture and lore. When Deborah Ramirez came forward and alleged that Kavanaugh had exposed himself to her at a Yale dorm party, she recalled that, as a devout Catholic, she \u201cwasn\u2019t going to touch a penis until I was married,\u201d that she felt \u201cembarrassed and ashamed and humiliated.\u201d I understood that fear, a gut-churning revulsion from the contamination of a man\u2019s genitals. Much of this shaming is built into other Christian sects \u2015 Deuteronomy doesn\u2019t belong to the Vatican. But the church takes pride in being built on more than just the Bible, on its ancient traditions passed down in an unbroken line from the early days of the church.\n\nThe most purely Catholic part of my sex education, I always felt, was the invocation of the saints and the Virgin Mary. Evangelical and mainline Protestants might share certain tactics (purity rings, demonstrations in which a piece of duct tape gets less sticky after being stuck to several boys\u2019 sleeves), but these semi-mythical beings are Catholicism\u2019s special little way of recognizing who\u2019s doing godliness better.\n\nThe women saints presented to us as role models were almost universally virgins, starting with the Mother of God. Catholics place a special emphasis on Mary, who is termed the Queen of Heaven and the subject of numerous apparitions to saints around the world. Though she was a mother and wife, Mary is held by the Church to have remained sexually chaste until death; this allowed her to stay pure of sin.\n\n\u201cMy school taught me Mary died never having sinned in her entire life, and that she also never had sex in her entire life,\u201d remembered Stephanie, who went to Catholic school in New York state. Though Catholic girls are often told that sex within marriage is Godly and beautiful, the implication of Mary\u2019s lifelong purity is clear: Sex within marriage is at least just a teeny little bit sinful!\n\nThe church\u2019s saints are meant to intercede on our behalf \u2015 basically, you can pray to a saint, and the saint will use their superior clout to re-pray for you in the afterlife, as if you\u2019re getting spiritually retweeted by a celebrity\u2019s account. Saints are assigned as patrons to certain groups or concerns based on the circumstances of their lives and deaths; St. Blaise, a physician ultimately martyred by beheading, is the patron saint of throat ailments and choking, for example. St. Maria Goretti is not an anomaly in her patronage: The patron saints of rape victims are mostly not rape victims, but women who succeeded at being murdered instead.\n\nSaints Agnes and Lucy were early Roman saints who took vows consecrating their chastity to God and refused the advances of pagan men. Because of their refusals, they were imprisoned, tortured, and ultimately killed. Both were sentenced to be held in brothels and raped, but Agnes was protected when God struck her attempted rapists blind, while Lucy could not be dragged to the brothel even by the force of a team of oxen.\n\nThe Blessed Antonia Mesina was just 16 when she was beaten to death with a rock while resisting an attempted rape in 1935. \u201cAt autopsy,\u201d reads a hagiography on Savior.org, \u201cthe doctors determined that Antonia\u2019s body had not been sinfully violated.\u201d This should be irrelevant to the question of Antonia\u2019s chastity, but it\u2019s carefully noted, as if to guard against any suggestion that she was too impure for veneration.\n\nThe stain of the rapist\u2019s sinfulness transfers so easily to the victim: Her lack of victimhood is also proof of her virtue. In this, as in so many victim-blaming narratives, lies the cruel implication that being raped is blameworthy in itself. Even if you fight, struggle, scream, a man\u2019s success in raping you is also your sin, or at least your failure to be virtuous.\n\nNot every Catholic high school has a chastity club named after St. Maria Goretti. The more I talk to other Catholic school alums, the more I suspect that mine operated at a heightened level of feverish devotion.\n\nMy high school had one of the most Catholic views in the country: The campus of the University of Notre Dame, green lawns and conservative theologians, lay across the street. The university is a staid religious institution, but not as much as my high school. To wit: when I was a junior, Bishop John D\u2019Arcy ordered that the state\u2019s then-governor, Catholic Democrat Joe Kernan, have his invitation to speak at my school\u2019s commencement be withdrawn due to his pro-choice political stance. This year, Kernan was awarded Notre Dame\u2019s prestigious Rev. Edward Frederick Sorin, C.S.C., Award.\n\nI took a compulsory theology class each semester: Morality, Catholic Life, Sacraments. Sex featured in nearly all of them. We were told for many reasons not to have sex before marriage: Because within marriage it would be beautiful and godly; because we should save our virginity as gifts for our spouses; because we would get chlamydia and die; because God made orgasms for the sole purpose of procreation; because Mary could keep it in her pants and so could we.\n\nI didn\u2019t flirt because I was afraid. I didn\u2019t dance too close at prom because I was afraid. I didn\u2019t date because I was afraid. 'I\u2019m being good,' I told myself, and the church agreed.\n\nWe were told explicitly to be like Mary and Maria Goretti, but all Catholics are told this implicitly. The saints are woven into the Church\u2019s fabric, a tapestry of God-approved human figures. If we want to be good, Catholic women hear, we are to be more like these women. Our cultural understanding of morality has evolved somewhat with time, but the Church\u2019s saints remain fossilized in amber.\n\nIn 1950, when Pope Pius XII canonized Maria Goretti, he praised how \u201c[w]ith splendid courage she surrendered herself to God and His grace and so gave her life to protect her virginity,\u201d and told parents to look to her as a model for \u201chow to raise their God-given children in virtue, courage, and holiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a shining example for young people!\u201d applauded Pope John Paul II in a 2002 letter marking the centenary of Maria Goretti\u2019s death.\n\nEven apocryphal saints, like St. Ursula, a virgin martyr alongside her rumored 11,000 virgin martyr handmaidens, might be technically removed from the rolls but remain stubbornly bricked into the walls of the Church. They\u2019re in the names of our churches and schools, evoked in literature and legend. They\u2019re in our own names \u2015 so many Catholics are named after saints, and even if we weren\u2019t, there often is one anyway, like St. Clare, an acolyte of St. Francis of Assisi who fled a future as a wife to become a celibate nun. My friend recently told me that because of her middle name, Rose, she learned about St. Rose of Lima, who tried to disfigure herself so that she could evade marriage and keep her vow of chastity.\n\nTurned one way, these are stories of heroically selfless women. Turned another, these are stories of women who were afraid of men, understandably and mortally afraid, or who at least acted like they were. Being a good girl and being afraid of men, for me, looked like very similar things.\n\nSo in high school, I didn\u2019t go to parties with boys because I was afraid. I didn\u2019t flirt because I was afraid. I didn\u2019t dance too close at prom because I was afraid. I didn\u2019t date because I was afraid. \u201cI\u2019m being good,\u201d I told myself, and the church agreed. Prom chaperones high-fived me for saving room for the Holy Spirit, as if I\u2019d done it out of extreme moral strength.\n\nThe Catholic Church asks its enormous, far-ranging congregation to swallow so much doctrine that seems patently absurd, callous or needless. For some, it\u2019s an untenable amount. Even for those who remain in the church, so many disregard doctrines like the anti-contraception dictum (98 percent of sexually active American Catholic women of reproductive age have used contraception, according to a 2011 Guttmacher Institute report) that there\u2019s a special term for the pick-and-choose faithful: cafeteria Catholics.\n\nMy schooling successfully convinced me that the religion was all or nothing. I tried to be all, but eventually, I chose nothing. By the time I was a year out of Catholic school, attending a secular university, I was no longer a practicing Catholic at all. I identified as lapsed, because once you\u2019re baptized in the Church you are considered Catholic even if you stop practicing. I knew a lot of lapsed Catholics in college.\n\nLapsed suggests failure, defection; gym memberships or insurance policies lapse if we don\u2019t make payments. It\u2019s true, I haven\u2019t been meeting my obligations as a Catholic. But the word I think of, when it comes to my Catholicism, is not lapsed, but latent. It\u2019s there in my blood and my synapses, indelible in my subconscious mind, as if these stories were waiting silently for the right stimulus to stir them into consciousness again.\n\nDespite having lapsed, I\u2019d long been vaguely grateful to my Catholic education for keeping me on the straight and narrow, then for giving me something to rebel against. What I\u2019m really thanking it for, I guess, is for encouraging my fearfulness; I\u2019m offering gratitude for the sense it fostered in me that my sexuality didn\u2019t belong to me, though any sins committed against it did.\n\nMaybe I feel that these lessons protected me, or at least taught me to live in a world that does indeed operate by those rules. They just didn\u2019t teach me to believe in them, in the end. They rigorously trained me and my female friends in the structure and logic of an ideology many of us would turn against with a precise fervor that only derives from familiarity."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Lee Moran", "title": "Michelle Wolf Torches Trump Over \u2018So-Called Comedian\u2019 Insult", "description": "Wolf bashed Trump for his stance on Saudi Arabia in a blistering tweet, which has now gone viral.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michelle-wolf-donald-trump-white-house-correspondents-dinner_us_5bf501a9e4b03b230f9cb196", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf50426200000ac06029529.jpeg?cache=6v11p2tqa3&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T08:10:08Z", "content": "Michelle Wolf pulled no punches early Wednesday after President Donald Trump insulted her on Twitter.

In a fiery opinion issued Tuesday, Judge Carlton W. Reeves said the statute, described as one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country, \u201cunequivocally\u201d violated women\u2019s constitutional rights.\n\nReeves wrote of his \u201cfrustration\u201d that state lawmakers had chosen to pass the law despite the fact that similar legislation has been thrown out by federal courts in other states and that such litigation is very costly for taxpayers.\n\nHe contended the \u201creal reason\u201d for the ban\u2019s passage appeared to be the state\u2019s politically driven desire to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 law that assures a woman\u2019s constitutional right to access safe and legal abortions.\n\n\u201cThe state chose to pass a law it knew was unconstitutional to endorse a decades-long campaign, fueled by national interest groups, to ask the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v.

Mississippi\u2019s only abortion clinic, Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, filed a lawsuit challenging the ban on the same day, and Reeves put a temporary restraining order on the law the following morning.\n\nUnder Supreme Court precedent, states cannot restrict abortions before a fetus is considered viable. According to established medical consensus, viability typically begins at 23 to 24 weeks, Reeves noted in his opinion this week.\n\nThe judge acknowledged, however, that, \u201cwith the recent changes in the membership of the Supreme Court\u201d \u2015 an apparent reference to the additions of conservative Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch \u2015 the future of the nation\u2019s abortion laws has been cast into doubt.\n\n\u201cTime will tell. If overturning Roe is [Mississippi\u2019s] desired result, the state will have to seek that relief from a higher court.

But a vaccine for the disease, which was made available in 1995, has proved very effective in preventing hospitalization and deaths from chickenpox, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe CDC has found that two doses of the vaccine are about 90 percent effective at preventing chickenpox.\n\nMullendore told the Citizen Times that even though some parents may not think chickenpox is a serious disease, the outbreak at Asheville Waldorf should be taken seriously. Two to three out of every 1,000 children infected with the virus require hospitalization, she said.\n\n\u201cTo me, that\u2019s not a mild disease, and if you\u2019re the parent of one of those children, you probably don\u2019t think so either,\u201d she told the paper.\n\nMullendore told CNN that no complications or hospitalizations have been reported from the outbreak at the Asheville Waldorf School.\n\nMajorities of all American religious groups agree that vaccines should be required for schoolchildren, according to a 2016 Pew Research Center study that asked participants about the common childhood vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella. But some religious groups \u2015 particularly white evangelical Protestants and the religiously unaffiliated \u2015 expressed a little less support for requiring the MMR vaccine than others.\n\nSusan Sullivan, a nurse who serves as a consultant to the state\u2019s health departments on vaccine-preventable diseases, told the Citizen Times that pockets of unvaccinated people often serve as \u201creservoirs for disease.\u201d\n\nWhile chickenpox isn\u2019t life-threatening in most cases, the CDC says it can still be dangerous to infants, pregnant women and others with compromised immune systems.\n\nThat\u2019s why Sullivan said getting vaccinated helps protect the larger community."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Ryan J.

Though author J.K. Rowling revealed more than a decade ago that she \u201calways thought of Dumbledore as gay\u201d as she crafted the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d series, director David Yates downplayed that issue. He told Entertainment Weekly in January his film would not depict the character as an \u201cexplicitly\u201d gay man.\n\nSpeaking to The New York Times in an interview published Monday, Law responded to Yates\u2019 remarks and hinted that future \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d films would delve into the specifics of his character\u2019s boyhood relationship with Gellert Grindelwald (played by Johnny Depp).\n\n\u201cPut it this way: This film is not about (Dumbledore\u2019s) homosexuality, nor does his sexuality define him,\u201d Law said. \u201cBut that relationship is certainly a defining element of who he is and what he\u2019s about.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI also don\u2019t think he\u2019s someone who has given his heart or his soul to many people. The aftermath of their relationship left him reeling, and he\u2019s packed his heart in ice, to be honest, and no one\u2019s quite thawed it.\u201d\n\nLaw also said had \u201cno idea\u201d whether a romance between Dumbledore and Grindelwald would materialize in a future film. Still, the actor kept the door open to having his character lead a more authentic life onscreen looking forward.\n\n\u201cI think the world is ready for it,\u201d he said, \u201cand if it isn\u2019t, it bloody well should be.\u201d\n\nLaw previously discussed how Dumbledore\u2019s sexuality would manifest itself, saying in a chat with Entertainment Weekly in July, saying that he, Rowling and Yates had agreed, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to reveal everything all at once.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Sam Levine", "title": "Federal Judge Shreds Trump's DOJ For Seeking So Many Delays In Census Trial", "description": "The Justice Department's conduct in the citizenship question case could be subject to sanctions, the judge suggested.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/census-citizenship-question-trial-delay_us_5bf48e1fe4b0eb6d93095d61", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf48ea02100009c06ca286a.jpeg?cache=pwcq97e73w&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T00:26:28Z", "content": "A federal judge in New York City strongly rebuked the Trump administration on Tuesday over its repeated attempts to slow down a lawsuit challenging the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

The Supreme Court had rejected a very similar request to temporarily stop the litigation just weeks ago, the judge noted.\n\nThe judge, who sits in the Southern District of New York, did not hold back his frustration in his 7-page opinion, noting that the Department of Justice had submitted 12 separate requests to delay the proceedings since the Labor Day weekend.\n\n\u201cUnless burdening Plaintiffs and the federal courts with make-work is a feature of Defendants\u2019 litigation strategy, as opposed to a bug, it is hard to see the point,\u201d Furman wrote.\n\nAll along, the judge has expressed a desire to move the case along quickly, recognizing that any decision he makes is likely to be appealed to higher courts and that the issue needs to be resolved quickly so that the Census Bureau has time to print the census forms.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Furman wrote in his Tuesday ruling.\n\nThe lawsuit \u2015 brought by 18 states, the District of Columbia, several cities and a handful of immigrant groups \u2015 argues that the decision to add the citizenship question was motivated by discriminatory intent. They also say the decision should be set aside on the grounds that it was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nIn this latest effort to stall the proceedings, the Justice Department said that doing so would help conserve judicial resources, an argument the judge dismissed as \u201cgalling.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Defendants were truly interested in conserving judicial resources, they could have avoided burdening this Court, the Second Circuit, and the Supreme Court with twelve stay applications over the last eleven weeks that, with one narrow exception, have been repeatedly rejected as meritless,\u201d Furman wrote. \u201cInstead, Defendants would have focused their attention on the ultimate issues in this case, where the attention of the parties and the Court now belongs.\u201d\n\nKelly Laco, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment on Furman\u2019s ruling.\n\nThe Justice Department appealed this latest motion to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit even before Furman had ruled on it \u2015 a highly unusual move that clearly annoyed the judge, who suggested the department\u2019s conduct in the case was sanctionable.\n\n\u201cDefendants\u2019 motion makes so little sense, even on its own terms, that it is hard to understand as anything but an attempt to avoid a timely decision on the merits altogether,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cThat conclusion is reinforced by the fact that Defendants, once again, appealed to the Second Circuit even before this Court had heard from Plaintiffs, let alone issued this ruling on the motion.\u201d\n\nFurman also noted that the 2nd Circuit had already denied that appeal as \u201cpremature.\u201d\n\nAmy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood, who is leading the case for the plaintiffs, praised Furman\u2019s decision."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "AP", "title": "Democrat Ben McAdams Defeats Republican Mia Love In Utah House Race", "description": "The Salt Lake County mayor's victory over the Republican congresswoman adds to the Democrats' new majority in the House of Representatives.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ben-mcadams-mia-love-utah-house-race_us_5bf4a2cae4b0eb6d93096976", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf4a305220000f905de3eb4.jpeg?cache=oqkak5w2ja&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T00:22:19Z", "content": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) Democrat Ben McAdams has flipped a U.S. House seat in deep-red Utah, defeating incumbent Republican U.S. Rep.

State election officials will certify the results next Monday.\n\nMcAdams declared victory Monday night after a release of ballots gave him a margin his campaign believed was insurmountable.\n\n\u201cThis race was about connecting with Utah,\u201d he said. \u201cThis race was about who was best positioned to serve Utah and working to not get it caught up in a national, partisan election.\u201d\n\nLove did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nHe pitched himself as a solid moderate, and not a typical Democrat, while calling Love a partisan who almost always votes with the president. The strategy was aimed at independent voters who account for nearly four in 10 voters in the largely suburban district, and designed to overcome his built-in disadvantage in a district where registered Republicans in the district outnumber Democrats by nearly 3-to-1.\n\nHe is an attorney who graduated from Columbia Law School and practiced in New York before returning to his home state of Utah. He has been a political figure in the state for a decade. He was elected as one of the few Democrats in the GOP-dominated state Legislature in 2008 and successfully ran for the Salt Lake County mayor\u2019s seat four years later.\n\nHe became known for working with the state\u2019s Republican leaders on issues like homelessness, where he backed a narrow Medicaid expansion to cover treatment and once went undercover as a homeless person when the issue reached crisis mode downtown.\n\nThough solidly conservative, Utah voters have long been uncomfortable with Trump\u2019s brash style and his comments about women and immigrants. That anxiety is especially pronounced in the suburbs of blue-leaning Salt Lake City, and McAdams\u2019 mayoral position gave him solid name recognition with voters.\n\nMcAdams said during the campaign he would not support California Rep. Nancy Pelosi as House Speaker and insisting he\u2019d be able to work with the president. He sharply criticized Love\u2019s support for the GOP-backed tax overhaul and said she had not been available enough to her constituents at town halls.\n\nHe has already signed a letter along with 15 other Democrats vowing to oppose Pelosi.\n\nLove pushed back hard, saying the tax overhaul has been good for people in Utah and defending her approach of meeting with voters in smaller groups, on the phone or online.\n\nShe highlighted the times she\u2019s stood up to the president, like when Trump used an expletive to describe her parents\u2019 home country of Haiti. She tried to separate herself from Trump on trade and immigration.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t appreciate her approach, calling her out by name in a news conference the morning after Election Day, where he also bashed other Republicans who he said lost because they didn\u2019t fully embrace him."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Sarah Ruiz-Grossman", "title": "California Communities Step Up To Get Thanksgiving Meals To Camp Fire Victims", "description": "Celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s is aiming to serve up to 15,000 meals to evacuees, including in shelters.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thanksgiving-meals-camp-fire-victims-california_us_5bf492d2e4b0771fb6b3afcc", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf4970f1d0000250231344a.jpeg?cache=aj2djBUts6&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-21T00:09:54Z", "content": "As Northern California still reels from the deadly, ongoing Camp fire with dozens dead, hundreds still missing and thousands left homeless local communities and groups are stepping up to make sure those displaced will get a Thanksgiving meal this week.

As she learned that hundreds of evacuees were staying nearby, she started a Facebook group and recruited friends to help. As the event grew, local businesses pitched in, some providing transportation to the event, others offering to host and groom evacuees\u2019 pets while they eat, and others still donating food and drinks for the meal."}]
