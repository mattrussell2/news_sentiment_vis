In the eight years since Amazon started adding tens of thousands of jobs, Seattle has achieved the country\u2019s second-highest per-capita income and its 11th-fastest job growth. We host a disproportionate share of America\u2019s best restaurants. The influx of tech workers and tax revenues have led a surge in public spending. Our buses run more often than ever, our light rail system is expanding and our parks are so well manicured that we sometimes forget we can only enjoy them three months out of the year.\n\nIn the \u201ccon\u201d column, however, is the undeniable fact that the city\u2019s boom has come on the backs of its poorest residents. The influx of population \u2014 Seattle grew more in the last seven years than it did during the previous 30 \u2014 has pushed housing prices upward, turning homeowners into millionaires and renters into refugees. Our homelessness crisis is so bad the mayor has declared it an emergency. Our public schools are running the largest deficits since the 1970s. All those fancy new restaurants? Like a lot of other Old Seattle townies, I can\u2019t afford a meal at most of them.\n\nBut the most important thing to know about what has happened to Seattle is that it\u2019s not all Amazon\u2019s fault. Every effect of the company\u2019s expansion was both predictable and preventable.\n\nThis week, Amazon announced that its second headquarters, known as HQ2, would be split between New York City\u2019s Queens borough and \u201cNational Landing,\u201d a made-up name for an existing Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C. The company will reportedly inject at least 25,000 new jobs and billions in investment into each site.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be disruptive, but it doesn\u2019t have to be disastrous. Amazon is a giant, amoral, profit-driven behemoth. There\u2019s nothing its new hosts can do about that. What they can do, however, is pass laws that ensure the company\u2019s effects will be positive.\n\nThere is no such thing as a good or a bad corporation; there are only good and bad laws regulating them. Here are some of the things Seattle did when we became a company town and others that some of us wish we would have done sooner.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images Amazon's Seattle campus.\n\nMake Work Equitable\n\nThe logic behind New York\u2019s and Virginia\u2019s massive subsidies for Amazon ($48,000 and $22,000 per job, respectively) is that the company will have a multiplier effect, forming clusters of tech and service workers around its campuses.\n\nThere\u2019s even evidence this will happen the way legislators want it to. A 2017 study of more than 300 cities found that each new high-tech job created five more in supporting industries. The study also found, however, that the majority of these additional jobs weren\u2019t in high-tech sectors. Each highly paid, highly technical position created three jobs in \u201cnon-professional\u201d occupations. What this means for the HQ2 cities is that, along with five more digits of software developers, they could find themselves with up to 75,000 new waiters, chefs, hairdressers, cashiers and janitors.\n\nVirginia\u2019s minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. Neither the state nor the city of Arlington, where the bulk of Amazon\u2019s investment will go, have policies guaranteeing paid sick leave or family leave for workers. If National Landing doesn\u2019t improve basic working conditions, the primary effect of Amazon\u2019s investment will be the creation of an army of impoverished, insecure workers. If Amazon, a massive, publicly traded corporation, can guarantee its workers a $15 per hour minimum wage, Virginia has no excuse not to match it.\n\nLegally speaking, things look slightly better in New York. The city already has paid sick leave and family leave and a minimum wage heading toward $15 an hour. Where the city falls down, however, is enforcement. A 2017 evaluation found rampant evidence of informal work, wage theft and sexual harassment, especially among female workers and immigrants. Nearly 20 percent of food-service employees hired as \u201ccontingent workers\u201d said they were paid below the minimum wage.\n\nMany of the workers Amazon is hiring for its HQ2 locations will enjoy six-figure salaries alongside luxurious benefit packages. If its new host cities want to make the most of the company\u2019s investment, the least they can do is crack down on the exploitation of the people feeding, clothing and cleaning the homes of its workers.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images A residential neighborhood just a few blocks from Amazon's proposed new campus in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nBuild Lots of Housing\n\nOne of the painful, forgotten truths of municipal politics is that cities do not decide how large their populations will be. Amazon did not ask Seattle\u2019s permission to expand by 35,000 workers in 2010. The 114,000 people who moved here in the last eight years did not apply for visas. It all just \u2026 happened.\n\nBut, although cities don\u2019t control their own growth, they do control how they respond to it. Since Amazon began its rapid expansion, Seattle has built about one new home for every three new jobs. That makes us superstars compared with San Francisco, where the ratio is 1 to 8, but it\u2019s still nowhere enough to meet the need.\n\nThe result is nearly a decade of relentless but mostly invisible gentrification. While plenty of glass-and steel-towers have gone up downtown, the vast majority of the city is preserved in amber by zoning regulations that make it illegal to build anything other than McMansions. That hasn\u2019t stopped tech workers from moving here, but it has pitted them against each other in bidding wars for the homes already here. According to their Zillow application, the two Microsoft employees who moved into my last apartment \u2014 I decided to move out after two years of 10 percent rent increases \u2014 have a combined income of $248,000 per year. The look of my neighborhood didn\u2019t change, but the wealth of its residents did.\n\nAmazon\u2019s new host cities shouldn\u2019t make the same mistake. Even before the company announced its new host cities, Arlington had a housing shortage, steeply rising prices and a local debate about whether to loosen restrictions on building apartments. Across the river, Washington\u2019s lack of affordability is well-documented, and the city is already behind on the estimated 690,000 units of housing it needs by 2045 just to keep up with job growth.\n\nQueens, as part of a city slightly more comfortable with skyscrapers, looks better on this score. The HQ2 site in Long Island City has already built more housing than any other New York neighborhood since 2010. Still, since Amazon\u2019s announcements, calls to halt construction and slow down a planned rezoning are intensifying.\n\nLocal residents\u2019 worries make sense. The neighborhood is already suffering from rapid gentrification, and Amazon\u2019s buildings are sited right next to the country\u2019s largest public housing complex. The mayor\u2019s and governor\u2019s ostensible reasons for inviting Amazon are to lift up local residents, not to displace them with luxury condos.\n\nBut if Seattle\u2019s experience demonstrates anything, it is that refusing to build new housing won\u2019t lessen gentrification pressures. It will intensify them. Amazon workers, like everyone else, want to live close to their jobs. If the city builds as tall and as dense as possible, new apartments could act as a release valve for the influx of new demand. If the city refuses to \u2015 like San Francisco has for decades \u2015 rich techies will simply buy or rent up all the real estate that\u2019s already there.\n\nNo one likes a bunch of soulless new apartment towers going up next door. But in the last two years, as Seattle has added them by the dozen, rents have finally leveled off. We\u2019ve also added fees on developers that pay into a fund to preserve affordable housing. There is still a long way to go, but the city is an object lesson in the principle that you can build your way out of a housing crisis \u2015 even if what you build isn\u2019t always pretty.\n\nElaine Thompson/ASSOCIATED PRESS Protesters at a Seattle City Council meeting. Earlier this year, the city passed a law that would have taxed large corporations, including Amazon, to fund homelessness services. The law was repealed after Amazon funded a campaign against it.\n\nDon\u2019t Forget the Fundamentals\n\nKing County, where Seattle sits, has the third-largest homeless population in the United States. Nearly 50 percent are unsheltered.\n\nLast year, city officials passed a modest tax on large corporations to scale up the city\u2019s response to the crisis. Almost immediately, Amazon officials threatened to halt the company\u2019s expansion and move thousands of jobs to other cities. Then, when the City Council didn\u2019t relent, the company teamed up with Starbucks to fund an effort to repeal the tax through a ballot initiative.\n\nIt worked. Facing a deep-pocketed publicity campaign, the City Council reversed its decision and repealed the law. Somehow, two of the world\u2019s largest corporations convinced voters that mandatory contributions to solving the problems they (partially) helped cause was a bridge too far. Two months later, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced that he was donating $2 billion, or around 1.2 percent of his personal wealth, to ending homelessness and supporting early childhood education. He declined, however, to specify which charities he would give to or how much per year.\n\nIt is an obvious lesson, but one that city leaders must be constantly reminded of: Corporations are not your friends. Amazon has neither a moral conscience nor a mandate for social responsibility. It is simply a company that will, like all others, always put pleasing its shareholders above caring for its community.\n\nCity officials need to keep this fundamental fact at the front of their minds. Amazon\u2019s press release this week highlighted the \u201ccommunity investments\u201d it would make at each of its sites. In New York, it will reserve office space for an elementary school and artists\u2019 workspaces. In Virginia, it will donate funds to improving pedestrian, airport and subway infrastructure.\n\nBut as Seattle\u2019s experience over the past year demonstrates, these community investments are voluntary, contingent and minuscule compared with the effects the company will have. Any attempt by the city to squeeze more funding from the company \u2015 or make its commitments mandatory and ongoing \u2015 will invite massive backlash, including disinformation campaigns and cynical political posturing.\n\nNew York and Virginia already have progressive income taxes, which means they\u2019re better-positioned than Seattle to turn Amazon\u2019s investment into higher tax revenues. But in the future, as the company strains municipal infrastructure and political goodwill, city leaders will need automatic systems to force the company to chip in for mitigating its effects. And if politicians forget this obligation, their voters will have to remind them."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "S.V.

John Kasich, who ran against Trump in the 2016 GOP primaries and seems likely to do so again in 2020. \u201cIf they had said: \u2018We achieved greatness by being the most lying group of low travelers ever,\u2019 well, that that would be a true statement. Beyond that, there\u2019s nothing to give them credit for.\u201d\n\nTrump has told many thousands of falsehoods since taking office in January 2017, but his pace of dishonesties hit some 30 per day in the closing weeks of the midterms as he staged dozens of rallies to help Republicans in House, Senate and gubernatorial races around the country. Each rally typically contained several dozen Trump falsehoods, including some that were easily disproven.\n\nFor instance, Trump frequently claimed that his promised wall on the Mexican border is under construction and that he has received nearly $5 billion for it already from Congress. He claimed he passed a law letting veterans see private doctors in their communities, while others had tried and failed for 44 years. He claimed his military budget had set records, that U.S. Steel was opening as many as eight new plants and that the proper name for the Democratic Party was the \u201cDemocrat\u201d party.\n\nIn fact, Trump has not started building the wall and has not received a dime for its construction from Congress or, that matter, Mexico \u2015 the country that would, Trump promised hundreds of times during his campaign, pay for its construction.\n\nThe \u201cveterans choice\u201d act passed in 2014 under former President Barack Obama. Obama\u2019s 2010 and 2011 military budgets were both bigger than Trump\u2019s, even before adjusting for inflation. U.S. Steel is not opening any new factories, and the Democratic Party\u2019s name, of course, is and for more than a century has been the Democratic Party.\n\nThose claims were mainly about achievements Trump supposedly had already accomplished. Trump\u2019s falsehood about the pending tax cut, in contrast, was invented specifically to give voters a financial incentive to choose GOP candidates, according to a Republican close to the White House who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nI think campaigns are full of lies. Denny Elkins, Trump supporter at rally in Pensacola, Florida\n\nJamieson, whose Annenberg Public Policy Center runs the \u201cFactCheck\u201d operation, said that while Trump\u2019s willingness to lie may be disappointing or even maddening to Americans, the much bigger threat is how foreign adversaries could interpret his words.\n\nTrump\u2019s recent attacks on a New York Times story about continuing advancements in the North Korean missile program, for example, may be seen by that country\u2019s dictator\u2015 whom Trump has repeatedly claimed an abiding love for \u2015 as a license to continue, she said. And Trump\u2019s statements downplaying the significance of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by the Saudi Arabian government has similarly sent the wrong message, she added.\n\n\u201cThe place that concerns me is international affairs, where the consequences are huge and the president can act unilaterally,\u201d Jamieson said. About Khashoggi, she wondered: \u201cHad he not been president, would they have dared to have done that?\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s strongest supporters, meanwhile, did not seem terribly bothered by Trump\u2019s falsehoods about the status of that promised new tax cut.\n\n\u201cIn his defense, he\u2019s a very busy person,\u201d said Denny Elkins, who attended a Nov. 3 rally in Pensacola, Florida, where Trump told the crowd he was working on the tax cut \u201cright now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think campaigns are full of lies,\u201d said Elkins, a technician at the Glass Doctor franchise in nearby Niceville. He added that Trump was working far harder than his predecessor, Obama. \u201cI feel that Donald Trump is the first adult in that office since Ronald Reagan.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Sebastian Murdock", "title": "Gov.

A Georgia federal judge issued a similar ruling as that state worked to resolve a close governor\u2019s race.\n\nIn Florida, the recount of close races and attendant legal disputes over the validity of votes have stirred memories of the 2000 U.S. presidential election, when the U.S. Supreme Court stopped an ongoing recount in the state and sent George W.

He vowed to defend ICE against calls to abolish it, and to carry out President Donald Trump\u2019s order not to exempt anyone from removal if they are eligible for it. He also left open the possibility for families to be split up in the future so parents can be indefinitely detained without their children.\n\nBut much of the hearing was devoted to the family separations that took place while Vitiello was at CBP, where he served as acting deputy commissioner until June.\n\nIt\u2019s true that family separations were a result of increased prosecution of illegal border crossings. But there\u2019s ample evidence the administration was well aware that prosecuting parents would separate families \u2015 something it had considered in order to crack down on illegal border crossings \u2015 and that it was not simply an unintended consequence.\n\nStill, Trump and his administration have attempted to cast blame elsewhere for the immigrant families they separated, most of them under a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for illegal border crossings implemented in April. The stories of children being ripped from their parents\u2019 arms led to a public outcry, the suspension of the policy and a federal judge\u2019s order for the government to reunite the families it split up \u2015 something it was not fully prepared to do, according to the government\u2019s own analysis.\n\nVitiello said that while officials were aware separation \u201cwould have been a consequence\u201d of the prosecutions, the government did not contemplate \u201chaving the systems work backwards\u201d for reunifications. \u201cNobody in the discussions that I was involved in were contemplating that these people would be separated forever,\u201d he said.\n\nVitiello said that \u201cluckily\u201d the president had ended \u201czero tolerance\u201d for parents. However, when asked about the lessons learned from the fiasco, he pointed largely to the lack of preparation to deal with the onslaught of criticism.\n\nCriticism also came up in the context of calls to abolish ICE, a political cause that has not gained sufficient traction in Congress to move forward. As a career Border Patrol officer in the past, Vitiello stressed his commitment to defend ICE personnel from protests, threats and misunderstandings about its mission.\n\nVitiello served as a Border Patrol officer and official for most of his career, and during his confirmation hearing he emphasized his desire to defend ICE\u2019s mission and the agents who carry it out. He indicated he would carry out Trump\u2019s efforts to crack down on unauthorized immigration even if it meant detaining people with longstanding ties to the U.S., arguing that ICE can and should remove the people it encounters if they\u2019ve undergone court proceedings.\n\nVitiello also had to defend heated language of his own. He apologized for a 2015 tweet calling the Democratic Party the \u201cNeoKlanist\u201d party, which he said was a joke he thought he\u2019d sent in a private message.\n\nAs head of ICE, Vitiello could now be in charge of another round of family separations, should the government implement a \u201cbinary choice\u201d policy in which parents can choose to either waive their children\u2019s legal right to be freed from detention or have them be released without them. The Trump administration is seeking to change the policy by modifying the Flores Settlement agreement that bars indefinite detention of immigrant kids, even with their parents.\n\nVitiello said he\u2019s aware health professionals have warned that long-term detention is damaging to kids.\n\nBut he insisted that a \u201cbinary choice\u201d policy would provide due process to parents and speed up legal proceedings so people could be deported more quickly, and would discourage unauthorized immigration. It\u2019s unclear why indefinite detention of families or locking up parents while releasing their children would speed up immigration proceedings, which are largely delayed by backlogs in immigration courts."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Arthur Delaney, Dave Jamieson", "title": "Bernie Sanders, Fresh Off Amazon Wage Hike Win, Targets Walmart In New Bill", "description": "The Stop WALMART Act is designed to pressure America's largest employer into raising pay.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-walmart-minimum-wage_us_5bedc525e4b0443db862a5a8", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bedc58f2600000503847bd6.jpeg?cache=u00huzx3il&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T21:35:56Z", "content": "WASHINGTON Sen.

Now the Vermont independent has set his sights on another low-wage bogeyman and Amazon competitor: Walmart.\n\nIn a bill introduced Thursday, titled the Stop WALMART Act, Sanders is following essentially the same strategy that drove Amazon to say it would raise the starting pay in its fulfillment centers.\n\n\u201cYou have the wealthiest family in the United States, worth $180 billion,\u201d Sanders told HuffPost, referring to the Waltons, who own a majority stake in Walmart. \u201cThey\u2019re paying workers starvation wages.\u201d\n\nThe Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies Act, introduced by Sanders in September, would punish large companies for paying workers poorly enough that they qualify for welfare programs. The shorter version of its name, Stop BEZOS Act, pointed the finger directly at Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.\n\nThe Walmart bill \u2015 more formally, the Stop Welfare for Any Large Monopoly Amassing Revenue from Taxpayers Act \u2015 also ties one high-profile company to an unsavory practice. In this case, it\u2019s stock buybacks, which have surged this year in the wake of the big corporate tax cut that Republicans passed last December.\n\nAnd again the goal is to increase the lowest paid workers\u2019 wages. Under the proposal, large companies would not be allowed to buy back their own stock unless all their workers earned at least $15 per hour and their CEOS earned no more than 150 times what their median employee earned.\n\nA Walmart spokesman said the starting pay for its store employees is at least $11 per hour, and more in certain markets. \u201cWe have increased our starting wages by more than 50 percent in the last three years,\u201d the company said in a statement, adding that its average hourly compensation is $17.50 when benefits like health care are taken into account.\n\nA lot of employers have begun to pay higher wages as the economy has improved over the last few years, forcing companies to compete more for workers. In the cases of both Amazon and Walmart, it\u2019s hard to tell how much their pay hikes are due to company strategy or public pressure or simply market forces. The higher minimum wages being mandated by cities and states are also a factor.\n\nThough the new Sanders bill highlights Walmart in its title, the legislation would apply to any company that meets the criteria it lays out. The bill is unlikely to become law, mainly because Republicans still control the Senate and the White House.\n\nBut not even Democrats necessarily go along with Sanders\u2019 message bills \u2015 not a single senator co-sponsored his Amazon legislation. Some liberals have even argued that the Stop BEZOS Act would make for bad public policy if it passed. (\u201cMy think tank friends,\u201d Sanders said Wednesday.)\n\nStock buybacks have earned much liberal ire this year, as corporate cash has been funneled to shareholders instead of workers. Reducing the supply of a corporation\u2019s stock on the market inflates its value and typically benefits the company\u2019s executives, who are paid at least partially in stock and receive bonuses based on stock performance.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who introduced companion legislation in the House, pointed out that stock buybacks were not even totally legal before a 1982 decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t allowed to engage in manipulation of stock to enrich shareholders and to enrich executives,\u201d he said.\n\nThough Sanders wants both Walmart and Amazon to pay at least $15 per hour, the huge chain\u2019s front-line retail jobs are fundamentally different from the online giant\u2019s fulfillment center jobs. The latter tend to be more physically demanding and come with higher pay. The median materials moving worker earned $14.78 per hour in 2017, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, while the median retail sales employee made just $11.24."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "David Moye", "title": "Country Music Legend Roy Clark Dead At 85", "description": "Clark was one of the biggest country music stars of the 1960s and 70s.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roy-clark-hee-haw-dead-at-85_us_5bedb2c2e4b09f4670081ce6", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bedb4632600005801847bcc.png?cache=5wRjkKzdD2&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T20:28:02Z", "content": "Country music entertainer Roy Clark, who crossed over to the mainstream via the long-running variety show \u201cHee Haw,\u201d died Thursday at his home in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

He got his first one when he was 14 and was playing gigs within in a year.\n\nClark was soon touring with country legend Hank Williams and first played the Grand Ole Opry in 1950, according to his publicist.\n\nClark\u2019s career really took off in 1960 when he was invited to perform in Las Vegas. That was followed by his first country hit, \u201cThe Tips Of My Fingers.\u201d\n\nHis biggest hit overall was \u201cYesterday When I Was Young,\u201d a cover of a French song by Charles Aznavour that Clark turned into a top 20 pop hit in 1969.\n\nClark was a staple on both radio and TV throughout the 1960s, performing on nearly every variety show of that era.\n\nIn 1969, he got one of his own: \u201cHee Haw,\u201d a rural-themed variety show he co-hosted with Buck Owens on CBS.\n\nWhen the network canceled the show two-and-a-half years later, the program moved into syndication and aired until 1992.\n\nIn 1976, he became one of the first country stars to tour the Soviet Union, and in 1983 he was the first country star to open a theater in Branson, Missouri, according to USA Today. Branson has since become a major vacation destination known for its musical venues.\n\nNews of Clark\u2019s death spurred Twitter tributes.\n\nGrowing up watching #HeeHaw, I knew nobody could pick-&-grin like the great #RoyClark.

Growing up, we were taught to think beyond our circumstances and believe that we deserved the best. We were encouraged to enter competitive educational and professional worlds that had not been open to our parents.\n\nOutside of our neighborhoods and social circles, however, we were met with attitudes that we were \u201cexceptions,\u201d not the norm. We learned to ignore or overcome the implication that black people had negative attributes, and we believed in ourselves, nurtured each other and excelled anyway. Michelle Obama did all that, ascended beyond the stereotypes and become a global role model.\n\nShe has become an affirmation of the beauty, talent and strength for all African American women in Chicago and beyond.\n\nNathan Congleton/NBC/Getty Images Former first lady Michelle Obama, author of the new memoir \"Becoming.\"\n\nIt was obvious sitting in the stadium that many people are still inspired by her. The book launch had the feel of a major concert. Throngs of people (mostly women of all different ages and ethnicities) stood in long lines to buy books and souvenirs, including T-shirts, keychains, mugs, keychains and pens. Banners of some of Obama\u2019s quotes were placed throughout, and people took pictures of themselves next to them while holding her book.\n\nObama made it clear that she wrote her book to tell her own story in her own way. She, like a lot of us from predominantly black neighborhoods, seems to feel a need to help people understand that there are loving, nuclear, hard-working families on the South Side and throughout Chicago.\n\nShe talked about how her parents encouraged her and her brother Craig to believe in and express themselves. She described how her mother fought for her to receive a fair education in her neighborhood school as the demographics changed from multiracial to mostly black. She emphasized that there is community and excellence that emerges from these predominantly black sections of Chicago and similar communities around the country.\n\nMichelle Obama is a 'homegirl' who believed she could achieve great things and has become a multi-millionaire, international sensation and global icon.\n\nThese values of believing in yourself, challenging yourself, stepping out of your comfort zone and believing that you belong wherever you want emerged as the strongest messages from Obama\u2019s book launch event.\n\nMichelle Obama attended public schools in Chicago, then went on to Princeton and Harvard law. She, like so many of us who hail from the same racial and economic background, was the first generation to attend any college or the Ivy League. She was a trailblazer in her own right.\n\nMichelle Obama came from a community full of people who had dreams for their children to have better lives than they did. They fought for their children to get the best educations possible and to strive for professional opportunities that were out of reach for many in our parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 generations.\n\nObama became a beacon of hope for black women in America.\n\nThe black community has always known there are thousands of smart, talented, ambitious and accomplished people like Michelle Obama. It just seemed like some people outside of our community could not imagine that as a truth.\n\n\u201cThe world has this perspective that somehow Barack and Michelle Obama are different, that we\u2019re unique. And we\u2019re not. You just haven\u2019t seen us before,\u201d she said in an interview a few years ago.\n\nShe\u2019s right, of course. Many other African American women have walked a similar path. There are plenty of lesser-known black women who are loving mothers and devoted wives, who work hard, take care of themselves and their communities. These women have gone on to contribute to our country in professions that include doctors, lawyers, engineers, civil servants, dentists, business executives, entertainers, and educators.\n\nBut none have the same visibility or impact of Michelle Obama.\n\nShe has ascended to a position where she can make an impact on the entire globe. As first lady, she\u2019s been on the front lines facing ridicule, death threats, lies and trauma. Yet she endured and became a beacon of hope for those of us dealing with our own versions of insults and attempts to marginalize us as black women in America.\n\nAnd she continues to do so outside of her former role. Obama has not forgotten who she is. She celebrates it and encourages other black women to do the same, and to celebrate where they are and where they come from.\n\nMichelle Obama is a \u201chomegirl\u201d who believed she could achieve great things and has become a multi-millionaire, international sensation and global icon. She comes from a community of hard-working, hopeful, forward-thinking people who nurtured and believed in her. She is taking the values and sense of thinking beyond your circumstances that she experienced on the South Side of Chicago and is making an impact on millions all around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichelle Duster is an author, speaker, and writing professor at Columbia College Chicago.

West, Georgia State University/The Conversation\n\nThough we often discuss World War I through the lens of history, we occasionally do it through literature. When we do, we\u2019ll invariably go to the famous trilogy of Hemingway, Faulkner and Fitzgerald \u2013 the authors most representative of America\u2019s iconic Lost Generation. Their work is said to reflect a mood that emerged from the ashes of a war that, with its trail of carnage, left survivors around the world with a despairing vision of life, self and nation.\n\nThe anxiety and hopelessness of the Lost Generation has become embedded in literary and cultural history. But for black artists, writers and thinkers, the war meant something entirely different: It spawned a transformation of the way African-Americans imagined themselves, their past and their future.\n\nWith Africa as a source of inspiration, a \u201cNew Negro\u201d emerged out of the ruins of the Great War \u2013 not broken and disenchanted, but possessed with a new sense of self, one shaped from bold, unapologetically black models.\n\nAaron Douglas. \"Aspects of Negro Life: From Slavery to Reconstruction.\" Oil on canvas, 1934. The New York Public Library, Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, Art and Artifacts Division.\n\nDenying an African legacy\n\nBefore World War I, African-American literature depicted stoic, but constrained, black protagonists. They emulated European codes of class and respectability while rejecting any sort of African legacy or inheritance. In other words, they talked like white people, dressed like white people and accepted the narrative that white men were the source of America\u2019s greatness.\n\nFrom the most well-known 19th-century African-American writer, Frederick Douglass, to his less remembered contemporary, Alexander Crummell, literary black advocacy or racial uplift too often rested on this approach.\n\nStill, in the years leading up to World War I, there were rumblings of the \u201cNew Negro\u201d archetype. For example, in Paul Laurence Dunbar\u2019s 1902 novel \u201cThe Sport of the Gods\u201d and Pauline Hopkins\u2019 serialized novel\u201cHagar\u2019s Daughter,\u201d we see restless, dissatisfied young people who have no desire to become shuffling, servile second-class citizens.\n\nThis defiance, however, would not become widespread in African-American literature until the end of the war.\n\nA \u2018New Negro\u2019 emerges\n\nBlack soldiers abroad during World War I experienced a type of freedom and mobility unattainable back home. In cities from London to Paris, many, for the first time, could travel without the worry of being denied equal lodging accommodations or admission to entertainment venues.\n\nOnce they returned stateside, they became increasingly impatient with Jim Crow laws and codes of racial discrimination. Life, they realized, didn\u2019t have to be this way. In a nation that was now half a century beyond slavery, the fever spread among a new generation of blacks.\n\nA group of soldiers pose from the 93rd Division\u2019s 369th Infantry Regiment, which was nicknamed the \u2018Harlem Hellfighters.\u2019 US National Archives\n\nIn the war\u2019s aftermath, racial tensions heightened \u2013 a reflection of this mood. The summer of 1919 was known as the \u201cRed Summer\u201d for the number of race riots that erupted around the country, with one of the worst in Chicago, where 38 people died.\n\nAnd in black literature, African-American characters no longer looked to the white man \u2013 or his nations \u2013 as models of civilization. In his 1925 anthology entitled \u201cThe New Negro,\u201d writer, philosopher and Howard University professor Alain Locke has been credited with marshaling in the era we now know as the Harlem Renaissance. Locke, in his text, called on a generation of emerging black writers, artists and activists to look to Africa and to black folk culture in the United States and the Americas as a way to mine and explore a new strand of humanity.\n\nWe see this in Langston Hughes\u2019 poetry; in \u201cThe Negro Speaks of Rivers,\u201d he heralds Africa as source of creativity and cultural grounding:\n\nI built my hut by the Congo and it lulled me to sleep / I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.\n\nTwo Jakes \u2013 one black, one white\n\nUnlike the emerging literati of the Lost Generation, blacks, for the most part, weren\u2019t angst-ridden over a post-war world devoid of meaning: they had never internalized the myth of America as a shining \u201ccity upon a hill.\u201d For them, the war brought no end or loss, no disillusionment or void.\n\nClaude McKay. Wikimedia Commons\n\nWe see this difference if we compare Hemingway\u2019s protagonist Jake in \u201cThe Sun Also Rises\u201d (1926) to Claude McKay\u2019s protagonist in \u201cHome to Harlem\u201d (1928), also named Jake. Unlike Hemingway\u2019s lost, sullen and impotent hero who can\u2019t find his way home, McKay\u2019s Jake happily traverses Europe for a period after the war until he realizes he yearns for home.\n\nWhile life is still a struggle and racism persists, McKay\u2019s hero looks to the future with hope; he returns to Harlem where he relishes the many shades of black and brown beauties that he missed in Europe. McKay\u2019s Jake immerses himself in a black world of love and laughter \u2013 a place that loudly celebrates life. He becomes inspired not by the readings and ideals of white thinkers and writers, but through black prototypes in and beyond America. His West Indian co-worker introduces him to Toussaint L'Ouverture and Jean-Jaques Dessalines, the black heroes of the Haitian Revolution, and to the history of great African empires dating back to antiquity.\n\nIn the literary works of black women, a new ethos also emerged. In Zora Neale Hurston\u2019s 1937 novel \u201cTheir Eyes Were Watching God,\u201d the main character, Janie, is daring in her quest for freedom: She leaves the confines of her restrictive community to take up with a younger man.\n\nBlack musicians, artists and writers of the Harlem Renaissance are celebrated as leaders of this transformative era in black history. But Harlem wasn\u2019t alone. Cities such as Kansas City, St. Louis and Chicago also became hubs of black cosmopolitanism.\n\nAbove all, the African-American literary works born out of the ashes of World War I went on to spur the bold spirit of resistance of the African-American protest movement into the 21st century.\n\nWe also see that American literature is not a monolith of interpretation and experiences: In the case of post-World War I literature, even though one generation was lost, another was found."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Ron Dicker", "title": "Ashley Graham: \u2018Kim Kardashian Picked Spinach Out Of My Teeth\u2019", "description": "The model recounts the strange but true story of the reality star's gutsy move on \"The Tonight Show.\"", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ashley-graham-kim-kardashian-picked-spinach_us_5beda92ce4b03af89267eefd", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bedb1223c000091030eb9be.png?cache=7ZrYn2nEiX&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T19:26:54Z", "content": "Ashley Graham has experienced many milestones in her modeling career, including her groundbreaking cover appearance on the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.

He\u2019s gay, maybe, and the product of a rape committed by a school shooter dressed in a skintight rubber suit. Before a Satanist cult led by Sandra Bernhard showed him the proper path toward righteousness, he was full of insecurities, just like you and me. (\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s a bunch of reference material about how to be the Antichrist,\u201d he whines, and we nod our heads in recognition.) But if you can rewind the clock a few years, all it takes to stop the guy is a simple hit and run.\n\nThere\u2019s a compelling conceit nestled in the morass of \u201cAHS\u201d Season 8: What does it take to become the Antichrist? What happens when Rosemary\u2019s baby turns 3, amused by a sudden ability to kill any unfortunate soul (a nanny here, a priest there) who enters his bedroom? Movies like \u201cThe Omen\u201d and \u201cEnd of Days\u201d have chronicled the Antichrist\u2019s origins, but Hollywood is sorely lacking in Antichrist coming-of-age representation. (Their stories deserve to be told too!)\n\n\u201cApocalypse\u201d fills that void, melding threads from previous editions so that little Michael Langdon (played in adult form by Cody Fern), the youngster with blood smeared across his hands in the final scene of \u201cMurder House,\u201d almost fulfills his mortal-ending destiny.\n\nFX Cody Fern in \"American Horror Story: Apocalypse.\"\n\nThe season hopscotches through timelines and scenarios, witnessing Michael ripen with his goth-happy adoptive mother (Kathy Bates) and digress toward the worldwide wipeout that began this saga. Even as an accomplished adult with a cabal of warlock cronies, Michael\u2019s journey is not without its trials, namely the witches (from \u201cCoven,\u201d of course) who pop up at one of the Richard Serra-esque outposts he\u2019s running in present day\u2019s wintry afterworld.\n\nCordelia (Sarah Paulson) reigns as the Supreme Witch. She\u2019s leading what\u2019s effectively a matriarchy, which means Michael deeming to challenge her for top-dog status is just the sort of coup you\u2019d expect from a man whose ego has ballooned to ballistic proportions in the end time. His own success isn\u2019t satisfaction enough, so he has to take what belongs to a woman too.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the bildungsroman built into \u201cApocalypse\u201d favors a masculine journey. \u201cHereditary,\u201d the chilling horror hit that opened in June, has a similar spine. When demon worshippers crown 16-year-old Peter (Alex Wolff) their new king, it\u2019s at the expense of his little sister (Milly Shapiro), who\u2019d been christened the group\u2019s next monarch before their grandmother died. It\u2019s not Peter\u2019s fault. Really, it\u2019s a social evil: The occultists are adhering to sexist scripture that mandates a male ruler \u2015 a slice of actual demonology that writer-director Ari Aster incorporated in the film. Peter\u2019s sister, and entire family, died so he could take the throne as King Paimon.\n\n\u201cApocalypse,\u201d for all its bloated \u201cAHS\u201d greatest-hits gobbledygook and \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d send-ups, lets its women prevail, sort of. The universe is restored thanks to the witches\u2019 time-travel tricks, whereby Mallory (Billie Lourd), tapped to succeed Cordelia as the rightful Supreme, runs over Michael outside of Murder House right as Constance (Jessica Lange) was inadvertently jump-starting his dominion. Thanks to this 11th-hour feat, the coven lives on, absent only Myrtle Snow (Frances Conroy), its czar of one-liners and Grace Coddington hair.\n\nAnd yet the show couldn\u2019t help but slip in a victory for Michael\u2019s team (aka evil men) too. He\u2019s dead, but a new Antichrist is inexplicably born in the season\u2019s final minutes, via minor characters we never cared about \u2015 and yep, it\u2019s another boy. It may only be a matter of time before Miss Robichaux\u2019s Academy comes face to face with another charismatic male beast hungry to please Daddy.\n\nAlex Wolff in \"Hereditary.\"\n\nHere\u2019s what \u201cApocalypse\u201d has going for it: It\u2019s the first season I\u2019ve finished since \u201cFreak Show,\u201d which in the age of Trump feels like a lifetime ago. \u201cAHS\u201d seasons tend to taper off \u2015 read: become too ridiculous or convoluted \u2015 around the halfway mark, and not even the horror buff in me can survive their one-dimensional skein. But after Stevie Nicks showed up to perform \u201cGypsy\u201d in Episode 5 (because why not!), \u201cApocalypse\u201d basically rebooted its plot, doubling down on the Antichrist\u2019s pre-holocaust development, which was always more interesting than the Illuminati talk that undergirded the inciting annihilation.\n\nTherein, it found what previous go-rounds often shortchanged: a compelling thesis \u2015 the Antichrist is just as na\u00efve and misguided as the rest of us. It\u2019s too bad the season\u2019s crossover mythology outpaced that premise, becoming a nostalgia ploy in desperate need of moderation, and then retracting its girl-power mantra at the last second. No one wants a pleasant \u201cAHS\u201d ending, but \u201cApocalypse\u201d gendered its bleakness in a battle of the sexes with a doomed outcome.\n\nPop culture turns its little men into demons because in most traditions the devil is a patriarchal concept. Michael adores his mommy dearest, but it\u2019s his \u201cfather\u201d \u2015 you know, Satan \u2015 he seeks to please, just as Paimon\u2019s followers were adhering to their gospel when seeking a male figurehead. Both \u201cHereditary\u201d and \u201cApocalypse\u201d cloak themselves in feminist garb, presenting the former as a Toni Collette vehicle about grief and the latter as a witchy melodrama about sisterhood. But in the end \u2015 and I say this as someone who thinks \u201cHereditary\u201d is pretty great \u2015 they succumb to the same patterns we always see: Women do the work, yet men manage to win anyway."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Stateline", "title": "Polio-Like Illness AFM Tests An Overstretched Public Health System - HuffPost", "description": "HuffPost Polio-Like Illness AFM Tests An Overstretched Public Health System HuffPost By Michael Ollove.

It is the latest challenge during a time when public health spending has declined.\n\nBy Michael Ollove\n\nThe mysterious, polio-like disease that has struck 414 people \u2014 mostly young children \u2014 across the United States since 2014 comes at a time when the public health system already is overstretched.\n\nReported in 39 states and Washington, D.C., acute flaccid myelitis, known as AFM, causes muscle weakness and in some cases paralysis in the arms or legs, terrifying parents and puzzling medical researchers.\n\nThe disease has flared while state and federal governments largely have stopped making new investments in public health. While some infectious-disease experts think the CDC has taken too long to understand the cause of the disease, no high-profile critic has directly blamed the slow action on low public health funding.\n\nStill, many public health experts argue that the lack of investment further strains a system already stretched thin as it faces multiple challenges, including sharp upticks in sexually transmitted diseases and hepatitis A and C, the opioid epidemic, seasonal flu viruses and frequent natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires.\n\nThe low spending has thrown the U.S. public health system into \u201ccrisis,\u201d according to the Trust for America\u2019s Health, a nonpartisan, Washington, D.C.-based research organization that promotes disease and injury prevention.\n\n\u201cInsufficient funding has hampered the ability of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state and local health departments to keep pace with the new and continuing threats to the health of the American people and to fully fund prevention initiatives,\u201d the group said in a report this year on public health financing.\n\nState and local health departments must frequently shift personnel from one challenge to meet a new one, like AFM this year or the Zika virus a couple of years ago.\n\n\u201cWhen something unusual like this comes up, we don\u2019t have a pot of money to address that,\u201d said Kristen Ehresmann, Minnesota\u2019s director for infectious diseases. \u201cAnd neither does the CDC. We have to put staff on that new issue. You\u2019re constantly taking people off one thing in order to address another.\u201d\n\nCDC funding, three-fourths of which makes its way to local and state health departments, and public and private partners, in the form of grants, has lagged behind inflation since 2009 and has been almost flat since 2014. Notably, the portion of the agency\u2019s budget that goes to states for controlling infectious diseases \u00adhas also remained largely unchanged over the last four years.\n\nThe picture is similar if not worse at the state and local levels. State investment in public health funding ticked upward in the past decade only to fall below 2008 funding levels in 2015. According to the Trust for America\u2019s Health, 31 states reduced their spending on public health between fiscal 2016 and 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Association of County and City Health Officials estimates that since 2008, local health departments have lost 55,590 jobs through layoffs or attrition.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much work, it\u2019s easy to lose focus,\u201d said Laura Power, who teaches epidemiology and internal medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \u201cWhere do we put our effort? There\u2019s only so much money to go around.\u201d\n\nReporting Up\n\nAFM first drew attention in 2012 when the California Department of Public Health learned that a few children were suddenly afflicted with inexplicable weakness in their arms or legs. By the end of the year, 10 cases had been detected in the state.\n\nClinicians were not familiar with the disease; it was not one of the 120 illnesses that medical providers are required to report to their local or state health departments, which then report them to a disease surveillance system housed at the CDC.\n\nThose \u201cnotifiable diseases\u201d include infectious diseases such as meningitis, Legionnaires\u2019 disease and HIV, foodborne illnesses such as E. coli and non-infectious diseases, including cancer and lead poisoning. By reporting them up the chain, state and federal officials are able to see whether outbreaks are localized or widespread.\n\nBy 2014, AFM had been detected in 34 states. The CDC announced Tuesday that the number of confirmed cases for 2018 has climbed from the 72 reported last month to 90 across 27 states. The agency said it is investigating an additional 162 cases of patients with similar symptoms.\n\nAt this point, all states require health practitioners to report suspected cases.\n\nEpidemiological and clinical evidence gathered about the disease led the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, a collection of public health epidemiologists working as technical advisers to the CDC, to issue a case definition of the new disease in 2015 to help clinicians across the country recognize it.\n\nEven without knowing the cause of AFM, the CDC distributed information to local and state health departments and to clinicians on how to identify a possible case and what to look for in MRI tests. The agency also tentatively suggested ways to treat infected patients \u2014 mainly by quickly starting physical and rehabilitative therapy. The CDC said that about half of patients with AFM have recovered.\n\nThe agency also issued instructions on the type of specimens it needs to help understand the cause of the disease.\n\nThe CDC has research laboratories to investigate new diseases, as does the National Institutes of Health and academic medical systems, often operating under federal grants.\n\nTo nail down a cause for AFM, officials are looking to researchers at institutions such as the University of Tennessee Medical Center, the University of Colorado and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nParents and clinicians have criticized the CDC for the time it\u2019s taken to respond to the disease. Even some of the CDC\u2019s own medical advisers have complained. \u201cFrustrated and disappointed \u2014 I think that\u2019s exactly how most of us feel,\u201d Keith Van Haren, a neurologist at Stanford University Medical Center and a CDC medical adviser told CNN earlier this month.\n\n\u2018Nothing Makes You Feel Good\u2019\n\nSome parents have also bitterly complained that the CDC hasn\u2019t reported the deaths of some children from AFM. Nancy Messonnier, director of the agency\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, in a conference call with reporters Tuesday said the CDC could not specify the number of deaths linked to AFM because of a lack of follow-up investigation that it is now trying to correct.\n\nThe CDC said one person confirmed to have had AFM in 2017 died, although a spokeswoman, Kate Fowlie, said in an email, \u201cit is unclear what role AFM played in the death.\u201d She said no deaths among AFM patients have been reported to the agency this year.\n\nSince it appeared six years ago, AFM has spiked every other year, in 2014, 2016 and 2018. Many patients tested positive for an enterovirus known as D68, which was previously associated with respiratory symptoms but not weakness in the arms and legs. The link has led to a supposition that the virus may have mutated.\n\nBut the enterovirus hasn\u2019t been present in all those with AFM, prompting some scientists to investigate whether environmental or genetic factors might be playing a role. Messonnier said the CDC is now also exploring the possibility that the symptoms may be caused by an aberrant immune response to an infection rather than the infection itself.\n\nSome researchers also think that another virus might be a contributor. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible and maybe likely that there may be other enteroviruses that are causing similar symptoms,\u201d said Mike Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n\nBy the time the symptoms appear, those infected might already have rid their bodies of the virus. Or, as Messonnier said, a pathogen may be hiding undetected in the body.\n\n\u201cThis is a tough disease,\u201d Osterholm said, \u201cbecause it doesn\u2019t fit a model of strict cause and effect.\u201d\n\nOsterholm isn\u2019t convinced that a retreat in public health funding has hampered progress in the case of AFM. Public health departments at all levels, he said, are used to dropping everything to meet new public health menaces when they must.\n\n\u201cPublic health just takes on more with less,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury of dropping major efforts.\u201d He added, however, that \u201csuch a system can\u2019t go on forever.\u201d\n\nJohn Auerbach, president and CEO of the Trust for America\u2019s Health, thinks insufficient funding is already consequential. While he pointed out that Congress eventually came up with additional funding to deal with outbreaks of Ebola and Zika in recent years, the money was not ongoing.\n\nWhen the money runs out, he said, experts in diseases such as Ebola and Zika, including epidemiologists and laboratory staff, often are laid off, removing the very people who could best prevent future outbreaks.\n\n\u201cWe know when permanent personnel are well trained in preparedness, they are able to anticipate a risk and take action before a crisis occurs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if there aren\u2019t enough personnel, then you end up only being able to respond to an emergency, rather than prevent its appearance or reduce its impact.\u201d\n\nAs it is, he said, many health agencies can\u2019t do an adequate job to increase the rate of vaccinations or to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds, both of which would contribute greatly to reducing diseases, such as Zika and perhaps AFM, in the country, he said.\n\n\u201cEvery health department would say, \u2018Yes, we could do more, but only if we had the resources,\u2019\u201d Auerbach said."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Andy Campbell", "title": "Police Suggest Security Guard Jemel Roberson Was To Blame For His Own Death", "description": "Illinois State Police says Roberson refused to put down his gun.

Members of the alliance include bold-faced liberal names like Tom Steyer, George Soros and Susan Sandler. Reporters are not allowed into the event.\n\nGara LaMarche, the group\u2019s president, told HuffPost the donors would look intensely at the 2020 map but not focus on which candidates would be best to combat President Donald Trump. Just a single potential 2020 presidential candidate is speaking at the event.\n\n\u201cEveryone recognizes that despite Trump\u2019s numerous vulnerabilities, and despite being a minority president, that it\u2019s possible for him to replicate what he did,\u201d LaMarche said of the group\u2019s donors.\n\nBut he said they were encouraged by the progress made by Florida\u2019s Andrew Gillum, Georgia\u2019s Stacey Abrams and Beto O\u2019Rourke in Texas. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to take a deep look at some red states that have become more competitive,\u201d LaMarche said.\n\nHe also said donors want to develop an agenda to expand voting rights and battle Republican gerrymandering.\n\n\u201cWhen Republicans get into the office, they\u2019re focused on protecting their power and attacking Democratic power,\u201d he said. \u201cSo folks want us to focus on ways to expand access to the ballot.\u201d\n\nSessions at the conference this week include:\n\nThe Midterms: What Happened and What\u2019s Next\n\nThe Progressive Governing Agenda\n\n2020 Vision: Expanding the Progressive Roadmap\n\nExpanding the Electorate and Building Long-Term Power\n\nBuilding Progressive Power in Red States\n\nThreats to Our Democracy\n\nLibrarians and Moms on the Battlefield: The Promise and Pitfalls of the New Activists Fighting for Our Democracy\n\nFixing the Electoral College\n\nEducation: Leading the Way to the Presidency and a Senate Super Majority\n\nHow to Make our Elections Secure by 2020\n\nAfter Kavanaugh\n\nInnovation in Political Messaging\n\nExercising Progressive Power in Congress\n\nActivism Under Siege: How Do We Protect Protest and Safeguard the Right to Free Speech?\n\nFacing Forward: Democracy, Climate Change, and Race\n\nThe Power of Donor Collectives\n\nThe Youth Vote in 2018 and Beyond\n\nUnrigging Our Democracy\n\nInequality and the Future of Progressive Politics\n\nRational Organizing: Empowering Our Communities, Getting to Scale, and Winning\n\nThe Next Generation of Progressive Leadership\n\nDemocracy Alliance formed with the idea of building up the long-term infrastructure of the progressive movement, rather than sending money to campaigns and candidates. Over the years, the network has steered millions of dollars to organizations like the Center for American Progress and Media Matters. But in recent years, it has also been looking more toward local and grassroots groups.\n\nScoring a speaking spot at the Democracy Alliance conference is a big win for a progressive organization, which then has a shot to pitch itself to the donors.\n\nRelatively few elected officials are on the agenda. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (Wash.) will speak on the progressive governing agenda, as will New York City Councilmember Brad Lander. Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a potential 2020 presidential nominee, will speak on using education as an issue to win in red states and develop a Senate supermajority. (The event McAuliffe is speaking at was organized by an individual donor; no 2020 candidate is being given the chance to speak on the main stage at the event.) On Friday, incoming House intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff (Calif.) will speak to the donors. And freshly elected Reps.-elect Lucy McBath of Georgia and Deb Haaland and Xochitl Torres Small of New Mexico will be at the conference\u2019s closing dinner on Friday night.\n\nWhile Steyer won\u2019t be speaking, a staffer from his youth organizing group NextGen America, will be talking about getting more young people to the polls in 2020.\n\nView the schedule below:"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Nina Golgowski", "title": "Man Shouts 'Heil Hitler, Heil Trump' At 'Fiddler On The Roof' Performance", "description": "\"I seriously was thinking he was gonna start shooting,\" one witness said of the incident in Baltimore.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/heil-hitler-trump-at-fiddler-on-the-roof_us_5bed7bebe4b0dbb7ea681990", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5beda49f1d00008500313288.png?cache=Pl1knJMyW7&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T18:48:30Z", "content": "A man yelled \u201cHeil Hitler, Heil Trump\u201d during the intermission of the musical \u201cFiddler on the Roof\u201d in Baltimore Wednesday night, according to witnesses who said they immediately feared that a gunman was in the building.

Of the pharmacies that said they would dispense naloxone, only half had it in stock, according to research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in November.\n\nChain pharmacies were significantly more likely to offer naloxone than independent pharmacies.\n\nA different survey published in JAMA was conducted in Texas, where naloxone is available at pharmacies that have standing orders from prescribers to dispense it. Researchers surveyed 2,317 chain pharmacies with those standing orders and found that 84 percent said they would sell the drug without a prescription. Of those pharmacies, 69 percent said they had naloxone in stock.\n\nResearchers in both studies cited lack of knowledge about the laws surrounding naloxone prescription, insufficient training for pharmacists and stigma as possible reasons that pharmacies aren\u2019t dispensing the life-saving drugs, even though they\u2019re legally allowed to do so.\n\nWe need to continue our efforts to educate and support pharmacists. Talia Puzantian, lead author of the California research\n\nFor example, at least 40 pharmacists in Texas thought that they could only dispense naloxone without a prescription if a patient was actively overdosing, which Kirk Evoy, lead author of the Texas research and a clinical assistant professor the University of Texas at Austin called \u201can especially alarming finding.\u201d If someone overdoses and there\u2019s no naloxone on hand, the correct response is to call 911, not travel to a pharmacy.\n\n\u201cWe need to continue our efforts to educate and support pharmacists,\u201d said Talia Puzantian, lead author of the California research and an associate professor of clinical sciences at Keck Graduate Institute School of Pharmacy and Health Sciences.\n\nIn California, some pharmacists weren\u2019t stocking naloxone because few customers were requesting it and not many doctors were prescribing it, leading to a circular pattern of deprioritizing the drug.\n\nPuzantian pointed to the pharmacists\u2019 successful public health efforts to immunize their communities against the flu as a good model, and noted that because of their access to patient information about overdose risk, pharmacists were \u201cwell poised\u201d to help fight the opioid epidemic.\n\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, the Food and Drug Administration commissioner, has called for a two-day advisory committee meeting to improve Americans\u2019 access to naloxone in December.\n\nIn the meantime, 72,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in 2017, with nearly 50,000 of those deaths attributable to opioids, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nNaloxone in pharmacies remains unreliable even in areas in which there\u2019s been a concerted effort to expand access.\n\nIn New York City, where 1,374 people died of drug overdoses in 2016, the health department\u2019s \u201cI Saved A Life\u201d naloxone awareness campaign directed New Yorkers to more than 700 pharmacies in the city that dispense naloxone without a prescription.\n\nA New York Times examination into that list, however, found that that less than a third of those pharmacies had naloxone on hand and would distribute it without a prescription. The Times, which placed calls to all 720 pharmacies on the list in March, reported that there was widespread confusion among pharmacists about insurance and prescribing protocols.\n\nEvoy said he viewed Texas\u2019 comparatively better results both as a sign of positive steps are being taken to improve naloxone access, and also as a call to action for community pharmacies to better educate and support their staffs."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Hayley Miller", "title": "Gillibrand Slams Financial Incentives Leading To Amazon\u2019s HQ2 Location In NY", "description": "New York's Democratic senator joins Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her criticism of the deal.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kirsten-gillibrand-amazon-new-york_us_5bed9a0ce4b09f467007d9d0", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bed9fad200000c30502937c.jpeg?cache=DKGdN4cKxl&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T17:57:32Z", "content": "Sen.

But May insisted the deal was in the national interest and offered a future relationship with \u201ca breadth and depth of co-operation beyond anything the EU has agreed with any other country.\u201d\n\nLeaders in the Labour Party disagreed.\n\n\u201cTheresa May has no authority left and is clearly incapable of delivering a Brexit deal that commands even the support of her Cabinet, let alone Parliament and the people of our country,\u201d said Jon Trickett, a member of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s senior team.\n\nWhat happens next depends on whether May can survive as prime minister. Assuming she does, she still faces a huge uphill battle to get her Brexit deal through a vote in the Commons scheduled for December.\n\nAt a press conference later on Thursday, May delivered a short, stoic statement that offered no new information on the quickly changing situation.\n\n\u201cServing in high office is an honor and privilege,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is also a heavy responsibility \u2015 that is true at any time, but especially when the stakes are so high.\u201d\n\nThe Brexit negotiations are \u201ca matter of the highest consequence,\u201d she said, touching \u201calmost every area of our national life.\u201d\n\nThe developments threaten to derail the prime minister\u2019s Brexit strategy ahead of a crucial EU summit, which European Council President Donald Tusk confirmed would take place on Nov. 25, \u201cif nothing extraordinary happens.\u201d\n\nWhat happens next depends on whether May can survive as prime minister. Assuming she does, she still faces a huge uphill battle to get her Brexit deal through a vote in the Commons scheduled for December.\n\nShe could withdraw the current deal and ask the EU for an extension of negotiations, but that would likely be fatal for the already embattled prime minister.\n\nIf she is ousted, Britain\u2019s already fraught political atmosphere will be further complicated by a Tory leadership battle. Raab, who just resigned, is expected to try to take May\u2019s place.\n\nMore disruptive still would be a Commons-wide vote of no confidence, which could trigger a general election."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Sara Boboltz", "title": "Trump Names Mar-A-Lago Member And Handbag Designer As Ambassador", "description": "If confirmed, Lana Marks would bring no prior diplomatic experience to her role as the U.S. ambassador to South Africa.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-south-african-ambassador-mar-a-lago-lana-marks_us_5bed856de4b0dbb7ea682f1c", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bed86943c0000a2020eb9a6.jpeg?cache=bq1YAbMeoS&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T16:45:01Z", "content": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced his intention to nominate Lana Marks, a luxury handbag designer, as the U.S. ambassador to South Africa.

Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) is all but announcing her intention to run for House speaker against Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), testing the waters Thursday by slamming Pelosi and foregrounding issues of race.\n\nWhile she stopped short of officially throwing her hat in the ring, Fudge told HuffPost she\u2019s been \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the number of people reaching out to support her potential speaker bid. She thinks the opposition to Pelosi in the caucus is much greater than the 17 Democrats who have signed a letter saying they won\u2019t support Pelosi to be speaker. According to Fudge, if the vote were held today, Pelosi would be well short of the numbers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate Nancy. I think Nancy has been a very good leader,\u201d Fudge told HuffPost. \u201cI just think it\u2019s time for a new one.\u201d\n\nBut you could be forgiven for thinking Fudge hates Pelosi. During the course of our interview, the former Congressional Black Caucus chairwoman made it clear she thinks Pelosi has not been a vocal enough advocate for African-Americans in Congress, she dismissed suggestions that Pelosi had led Democrats back to the majority, and she painted herself as equally liberal as Pelosi.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a pitch because at this point I\u2019ve not decided I\u2019m going to run,\u201d Fudge said, \u201cbut I would say this: My concern about the caucus is the same concern I have about the country. Just as there is this undertone of racism in the country, there\u2019s also that in our caucus.\u201d\n\nFudge pointed to Pelosi\u2019s refusal to endorse in the race for majority whip, a contest between the current No. 3 Democrat \u2015 and CBC stalwart \u2015 Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), and Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.).\n\n\u201cBut she wants our endorsements?\u201d Fudge said of Pelosi. \u201cWho has she endorsed?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not feeling the love,\u201d she added.\n\nFudge pushed back on suggestions that she may just be a stalking-horse candidate for Clyburn or another CBC member to mount a speaker bid \u2015 someone like current CBC Chairman Cedric Richmond (D-La.), for example, or Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.). She said anyone who thinks that doesn\u2019t know her very well. She also shot down a suggestion that her toying with a speaker run could be about combating a narrative that it\u2019s a bunch of misogynist white men who are trying to dethrone Pelosi \u2015 or that the Pelosi opposition is coming exclusively from moderates.\n\nInstead, Fudge said this was about a fresh start in Congress, making sure that Democratic leadership reflects the voters who gave Democrats the majority \u2015 specifically, African-American women. (Fudge pointed out that while women have gotten a lot of credit for ushering in the Democratic majority, white women are still broadly supporting Republicans. She mentioned that Stacey Abrams lost white women by 76 percent in her bid to be governor of Georgia, and that were it not for black women in Alabama, Roy Moore would now be a senator.)\n\n\u201cAnd so I\u2019m saying, what is wrong with acknowledging the fact that the Democratic Party is becoming more young, more black, and more brown?\u201d Fudge said. \u201cAnd letting that be reflected in our leadership.\u201d\n\nFudge also suggested Pelosi is simply unpopular with Democrats. She pointed to polling suggesting that Pelosi has a 17 percent favorability rating, and that more Democrats oppose Pelosi being speaker than those who support her.\n\nFudge ventured that one of the reasons people don\u2019t like Pelosi is because \u201cthey see her as an elitist.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I think to some degree she is,\u201d Fudge continued. \u201cShe\u2019s a very wealthy person. She raises a lot of money from a lot of other wealthy people.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to give her such big credit for winning back the House, and she should be here because she won. She didn\u2019t win it by herself,\u201d Fudge said.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to give her credit for the wins, why is she not responsible for all the losses?\u201d Fudge asked, pointing to the 63 seats Democrats lost in 2010 and the large majorities Republicans held in 2012, 2014 and 2016.\n\n\n\nFudge has taken her own licks from Pelosi\u2019s allies over the last 24 hours. When she first raised the possibility of running for speaker in an interview with Cleveland.com, it was quickly pointed out that Fudge is one of two House Democrats who has refused to co-sponsor the Equality Act, which would extend civil rights protections to people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nFudge said her stance has nothing to do with opposition to those issues, but is due to lawmakers opening up the Civil Rights Act to extend those protections. \u201cIf it were a standalone, I\u2019d vote for it today,\u201d she said, challenging people to find one vote where she has stood against the LGBTQ community. Fudge also said she has always supported marriage equality.\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States is a racist, in my opinion,\u201d Fudge said. \u201cIf we open up the Civil Rights Act, it\u2019s like opening up Pandora\u2019s box.\u201d\n\nAsked why the Civil Rights Act wouldn\u2019t be an appropriate place for those protections, she said she just disagreed with that idea. \u201cI believe that, if we open the Civil Rights Act \u2015 which basically could be done at any time \u2015 but if we open it, I think we open ourselves to problems that we don\u2019t intend.\u201d\n\nFudge also said she would be more bottom-up in her procedural approach than Pelosi. \u201cJust think about what happened,\u201d she said. \u201cOne day after we win back the House, leadership comes out and starts talking about what\u2019s going to be our first bill, what we\u2019re going to do first. Did they talk to anybody?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Team\u2019 means \u2018doing what I want you to do,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nShe offered that the top priority of Democrats might be protections for people with pre-existing conditions, or it might be student debt, or infrastructure, or job creation. \u201cBut nobody, none of the doors I knocked on, none of the people\u2019s hands I shook, said \u2018You should make campaign finance reform your No. 1 issue,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nFudge \u2015 who is a former lawyer, judge, mayor, and chief of staff in Congress \u2015 also thinks she could be just as capable a leader as Pelosi. \u201cThere are a lot of people here who are more than capable, who had lives outside of this institution, who have proven their skills and their capabilities. I\u2019m not the only one.\u201d\n\nAsked about working with President Donald Trump, whom she repeatedly called racist during our interview, Fudge said she didn\u2019t think it would present a problem.\n\n\u201cMind you, I\u2019ve been the mayor of a city,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve sat across from a lot of people that I have to work with.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Jenna Amatulli", "title": "GOP Senator To Trump: \u2018Tweeting A Little Less Would Not Cause Brain Damage\u2019", "description": "The Louisiana Republican dismissed Trump's tweets raging at special counsel Robert Mueller as \"talk.\"", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sen-john-kennedy-to-trump-tweeting-a-little-less-would-not-cause-brain-damage_us_5bed89bfe4b03af89267971f", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bed8d961f0000ff042636a1.png?ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T15:54:45Z", "content": "Sen.

We all know that certain foods have a reputation for causing gas \u2015 as the chant goes, \u201cbeans, beans, they\u2019re good for your heart. The more you eat, the more you ... \u201d \u2015 but there are other contributing foods and factors that could be causing problems. And discovering what\u2019s going on can help you get a grip on it.\n\nHuffPost chatted with experts to get to the bottom of tummy troubles. Below is everything you need to know about dealing with gas and why it\u2019s happening in the first place:\n\nCommon Reasons Why You\u2019re Experiencing Gas Problems\n\nEdelweiss Spykerman / EyeEm via Getty Images\n\nYour diet and lifestyle can obviously have an impact on how your intestines react. Some of the most common culprits of excessive gas include:\n\nYou have an underlying medical condition: According to Russell D. Cohen, a board member of the GI Research Foundation and the director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center at the University of Chicago, some people with certain medical conditions have worse gas than others. This includes those who live with inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn\u2019s disease or Colitis and other gastrointestinal issues, he explained, all of which impact the digestive track or intestines.\n\nYour body is not a fan of lactose: John Tsai, a board-certified gastroenterologist with Austin Gastroenterology, said that it is very common to be intolerant to lactose, which is found in items like dairy products.\n\n\u201cFor the majority of us, the ability to cleave lactose diminishes as we get older. If too much lactose is in the intestinal tract and not broken down, our gut bacteria finish the digestion process and this, in turn, can cause gas, bloating, pain and diarrhea,\u201d he said, adding that reducing or stopping lactose intake will often result in resolution of these symptoms.\n\nYou have a gluten intolerance: \u201cWe estimate that 1 to 2 percent of the population may have an allergy to gluten,\u201d Tsai said, adding that the substance, which is found in wheat, barley and rye, can trigger the body\u2019s immune system to cause inflammation and damage primarily to the intestinal tract.\n\nThis can lead to diarrhea, bloating, malnutrition and multiple serious health issues. Tsai added that the majority of patients who report an issue with gluten, however, are not allergic to gluten, but rather intolerant to it.\n\n\u201cThis can result in the symptoms of gas, bloating, pain and diarrhea,\u201d he said, noting that formal testing can be performed by your doctor to accurately diagnosis a gluten allergy (known as celiac disease) versus a gluten intolerance.\n\nIt\u2019s a side effect of a past surgery: Cohen noted that people who\u2019ve had GI surgeries in the past can often experience increased gassiness.\n\n\u201cImagine your GI system is a pond,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cAfter you have a GI surgery, that pond gets compromised in the part the surgery occurred \u2015 similar to an area where pond scum gathers. Our GI and bowel systems gather that bacteria in one spot, too, if it the area has been compromised.\u201d\n\nYou just gulped some air: Samantha Nazareth, a double-board-certified gastroenterologist practicing in New York City, said that \u201cswallowing air from talking while eating, drinking from a straw or chewing gum\u201d can definitely cause some flatulence.\n\nIt\u2019s specific veggies or your beverage: According to Cohen, certain foods can cause your body to expel more gas while digesting them. \u201cPickled and fermented foods are the No. 1 causes that make you gassier,\u201d he said.\n\nNext in line are cruciferous vegetables like kale, broccoli and cauliflower, which can be frequent contributors to gas. Beans, of course, are also gas-causing culprits.\n\nCohen added that carbonated beverages may also cause a build-up of gas in your body. \u201cIf you can\u2019t shake it, don\u2019t drink it,\u201d he said.\n\nYou\u2019re eating a high FODMAP diet: \u201cThere\u2019s a whole class of foods called FODMAPs that are known to cause gas,\u201d Nazareth said.\n\nFODMAPs, which stands for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols groups, \u201cessentially are short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed and rapidly fermented\u201d in the body, she explained, adding that they can therefore case flatulence. High-FODMAP foods include things like regular milk, dried fruit, artichokes, baked goods made of whole wheat, artificial sweeteners like Xylitol, garlic, onions and cashews.\n\nYou\u2019re backed up: \u201cIn many cases, people who get constipated often get more gas. This is because your body is literally fermenting that food and feces in your body until your bowels sweep everything out,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nAmanda Nighbert, a registered dietitian based in Kentucky, added that addressing constipation in a healthy way can go a long way in helping you to reduce gas. \u201cMake sure you are getting plenty of water daily, adequate fiber and consider [trying] magnesium citrate if constipation is chronic,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a great, all-natural way to treat and prevent constipation.\u201d\n\nYou are eating too fast: Scarfing down your meals and not properly chewing can also increase the likelihood of excess gas or air in your stomach.\n\n\u201cThis will make you feel very gassy and bloated,\u201d Nighbert said. In order to work around this, she recommends trying mindful eating and taking a breather in between bites.\n\nYou\u2019ve changed up your diet too suddenly: Colene Stoernell, a pediatric GI dietitian who offers nationwide online consultations for clients, said that making healthy food swaps are good, however, switching your diet up too rapidly can definitely lead to gas and bloating.\n\n\u201cWhenever you change your eating habits, your body needs time to adjust,\u201d he said. \u201cOne example is deciding to eat more veggies and going from zero to eight servings in a day \u2015 especially the veggies that are known gas producing ones like the cruciferous, broccoli, cauliflower \u2015 which are high in fructans and can cause bloating and gas in sensitive individuals.\u201d\n\nIt could be certain additives in foods: Attention fans of sweeteners in their coffee. Consuming a lot of sugar alcohols \u2015 like Xylitol, sorbitol, and maltitol \u2015 and inulin \u2015 such as chicory root \u2015 may be to blame.\n\n\u201cThe food industry has been adding these items to more and more foods, like ice cream and protein bars, and if you are not used to them or sensitive to them, they can cause a lot of gas and discomfort,\u201d Stoernell said. She added that inulin and sugar alcohols are not absorbed well in the body and can ferment in the gut, which in turn can cause gas and bloating.\n\nHow Do You Deal With it?\n\nJGI/Jamie Grill via Getty Images\n\nAccording to Tsai, gas pains are typically not a sign of a serious medical condition, although the symptoms can be a nuisance that can interfere with daily life and cause embarrassment.\n\nCohen added that if gassiness is combined with other symptoms, you should see a GI specialist. \u201cThose symptoms include vomiting, blood in stool, fevers or illness, sudden weight loss, and for kids, a key symptom is a loss of height growth or weight gain,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd here are a few other ways you can troubleshoot gas in your everyday life, according to Nazareth:\n\n\u201cGet regular exercises and movement to keep things moving along, as moving stimulates the movement in the intestines called peristalsis,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid eating too much and late at night.\n\n\n\n\n\nEliminate FODMAPs for up to eight weeks. Once gassiness goes away, then gradually reintroduce each category one at a time to determine if you can tolerate a specific fermentable carbohydrate. This would be better facilitated with a health care provider, she added.\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice mindful eating, which means coming to the present moment of mealtime. First, identify if you are hungry and eat then, Nazareth said. Sometimes we eat when we are bored, sad or stressed. Take a breath before eating, and also take the time to notice what the food\u2019s texture, smell and lastly the taste. Take the time to chew your food down and only focus on the task of eating.(So no scrolling on social media feeds at the same time, Nazareth said.)\n\n\u201cIf, after all of those attempts, gassiness persists, then you should be evaluated by a physician,\u201d Nazareth added.\n\n\u201cSearching for Normal\u201d is HuffPost\u2019s attempt to answer some of the internet\u2019s most pressing queries: Is it normal to ____?

Its victims accompany factory closings and the cutting of government assistance. They haunt post-9/11 military bases and hollow the promise of Silicon Valley high schools. Just about everywhere, psychiatric units and crisis hotlines are maxed out. According to the most recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are now more than twice as many suicides in the U.S. (45,000) as homicides; they are the 10th leading cause of death. You have to go all the way back to the dawn of the Great Depression to find a similar increase in the suicide rate. Meanwhile, in many other industrialized Western countries, suicides have been flat or steadily decreasing.\n\nWhat makes these numbers so scary is that they can\u2019t be explained away by any sort of demographic logic. Black women, white men, teenagers, 60-somethings, Hispanics, Native Americans, the rich, the poor\u2014they are all struggling. Suicide rates have spiked in every state but one (Nevada) since 1999. Kate Spade\u2019s and Anthony Bourdain\u2019s deaths were shocking to everybody but the epidemiologists who track the data.\n\nAnd these are just the reported cases. None of the numbers above account for the thousands of drug overdose deaths that are just suicides by another name. If you widen the lens a bit to include those contemplating suicide, the problem starts to take on the contours of an epidemic. In 2014, the federal government estimated that 9.4 million American adults had seriously considered the idea.\n\nThere\u2019s an inherent lack of closure to suicide. Even when people write notes, they can reveal so little. Suicides often leave loved ones, acquaintances and co-workers to question themselves for the rest of their lives. And in their own grief, they, too, can entertain dangerous thoughts. \u201cWith suicide you have that added trauma to it,\u201d said Julie Cerel, the president of the American Association of Suicidology. \u201cThe \u2018why\u2019 question of trying to search for meaning when there\u2019s no meaning available\u2014If I only had a note. If I only talked to the last person that they talked to. The \u2018onlys\u2019 can be torturous.\u2019\u201d Last year, Cerel published a study examining the consequences of suicide and found that each one could affect as many as 135 other people.\n\nThe fundamental mystery of suicide has long made it an object of fear and contempt within the medical establishment. Since the 1950s, public health officials have tried hotlines, individual therapy, group therapy, shock therapy and forced hospitalizations. Doctors have taken away people\u2019s shoelaces and belts and checked in on attempt survivors every 15 minutes to make sure they are still safe. They have coerced patients into signing contracts swearing that they would not kill themselves. They have piled on psychiatric medications with ever-more invasive side effects, only to watch the number of suicides continue to climb.\n\nEven now, most mental health professionals have no idea what to do when a suicidal person walks through their door. They\u2019re untrained, they\u2019re under-resourced and, not surprisingly, their responses can be remarkably callous. In an emergency room, an attempt survivor might be cuffed to a bed and made to wait hours to be officially admitted, sometimes days. Finding help beyond the ER can be harder yet.\n\n\u201cYou take someone who is not doing well, shutting down, and throw them in a system that requires them to have the highest problem-solving abilities and emotional regulation,\u201d said Jeff Sung, a psychiatrist colleague of Whiteside\u2019s who works with high-risk clients and trains others to do so. According to federal data, the majority of those in need of mental health services do not receive it.\n\nWhen confronted with the coldness of her colleagues, Whiteside grows exasperated. Because while the dead are invisible to most, she knows them. She gets how suicidal thoughts have their own seductive logic, how there is comfort in the notion that there is a surefire way to end one\u2019s pain. She sees why people might turn to these thoughts when they hit a crisis, even a minor one like missing a bus to work or accidently bending the corner of a favorite book. That\u2019s why suicidal urges are so much more dangerous than depression\u2014people can view death as an answer to a problem. And she knows that many patients of hers will always feel vulnerable to these thoughts. She has described her job as an endless war.\n\nStudent ID of the therapist as a young woman.\n\nWhiteside was born in Colville, Washington, 40 years ago, the first child of parents drawn to adventurous work wherever they could find it: building an oil pipeline in Alaska, raising cattle and conducting child health screenings in rural Washington, driving trucks through the Midwest. By the time she attended junior high, in Minnesota, Whiteside had enrolled in six different schools in three different states. But instead of turning her bitter or shy, all the moving seemed to sharpen her empathic powers. She became one of those canny little people who could intuit when those around her were in pain.\n\nAnd she could be impulsive in her efforts to help. When she was in eighth grade, one of her best friends called her frantic and in tears. The friend didn\u2019t go into detail, but said that she needed to escape her house immediately. So Whiteside planned a rescue. Shortly after midnight, Whiteside snuck out of a window in her family\u2019s basement apartment and stole her mother\u2019s sedan. She didn\u2019t think about the fact that she couldn\u2019t drive legally or that her friend\u2019s house was 8 miles away or that the roads were icy and covered in snow. She didn\u2019t care that she weighed only 80 pounds and could barely see over the steering wheel. She made it past the McDonald\u2019s, down the hill, to the one-lane country road where her friend lived before crashing the car into a ditch in front of the house.\n\nThe older Whiteside got, the clearer it became that she was better at looking after others than herself. In high school, she struggled with her body image along with depression and anxiety. Like her future clients, she found it excruciatingly difficult to talk about what she was experiencing. The idea of asking for help was \u201cthe scariest thing I could imagine,\u201d she said. During one point in college, she sent her mother, who had lost her own brother to suicide, a lengthy letter detailing her ups and downs. \u201cI\u2019m writing you this letter because I often have a hard time saying out loud what I mean,\u201d she confessed. \u201cI am just chicken.\u201d\n\nShe wanted so badly to understand the mechanics of despair, including her own. \u201cEverything I do has to be extreme,\u201d she wrote in her diary. \u201cI go through phases where I absolutely love myself\u2014I go through others where all I can think about is knives and bridges.\u201d At the University of Minnesota-Duluth, she read mental health textbooks and academic journals in her spare time. She was drawn to the field as a practical way of untangling life\u2019s most intractable problems. \u201cI took my first psychology class and I was like, \u2018Oh my God, you can actually change things,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not magic.\u201d\n\nBefore her junior year, Whiteside transferred to the University of Washington so she could learn from Marsha Linehan, a legend in the field of suicide research. Linehan had pioneered a powerful form of treatment called dialectical behavior therapy, or DBT, which trains patients how to reroute their suicidal impulses. It can be grueling, emotionally exhausting work that requires people to spend several hours a week in individual and group therapy, and therapists to do check-in calls as needed throughout the week. Linehan had a principle for all of her students: Clients came first, your own life came second.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t have suited Whiteside better. \u201cI\u2019ve found some semblance of passion,\u201d she wrote in her diary at the time. \u201cI have to think of myself and I have to think of my soul and I have to remember those in most need, those experiencing suffering beyond my imagination.\u201d In a letter of recommendation, Linehan wrote that Whiteside had \u201cbecome unflappable.\u201d\n\nText messages from Whiteside to a patient.\n\nAnd then Whiteside sprinted nose-first into the wall of the modern-day behavioral health care system. She took a clinical internship in the psychiatric department of Harborview Medical Center in downtown Seattle, an under-resourced, grim institution. The main goal, she kept hearing, was triage. She was there to stabilize suicidal patients, nothing more, because no one had the time to do more.\n\nWhiteside was tasked with probing patients for their treatment history and state of mind. There was the man who killed his dog and shot himself in the stomach. The immigrant who set himself on fire. The college student who had been found walking in the middle of a street clutching a teddy bear. Each one, she felt, was desperate for any form of help or kindness.\n\n\u201cI was absolutely insane, completely unconcerned with life,\u201d one former patient from that era said. \u201cThey had no idea what to do with me. But Ursula was looking at me in a way where she was actually waiting for me to respond. \u2026 It wasn\u2019t, \u2018What are your symptoms? What medications are you on?\u2019 It was, \u2018Tell me a little bit about your story.\u2019\u201d Whiteside knew that people who leave the hospital after a suicide attempt are at a greater risk of harming themselves again within 90 days. And yet the doctors at Harborview were only providing referrals for clinics most patients would never visit or putting patients on waiting lists for therapists who might not be right for them. \u201cThese patients were basically at this critical juncture,\u201d Whiteside said, \u201cand we were fucking blowing it.\u201d\n\nAfter her patients left the hospital, she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about them. So she began tracking them down, calling to see if they needed help or just to let them know they were on her mind. She handed out her phone number to patients before they left the hospital. On the back, she\u2019d also leave a personal note. Anything to keep them tethered to the world. For six months, she called a woman who had made an attempt after a breakup. The woman took Whiteside\u2019s calls for a while, until she didn\u2019t. Whiteside still doesn\u2019t know what happened to her.\n\n\u201cIt was almost an existential crisis for her,\u201d says Sarah Stuckey, one of Whiteside\u2019s best friends from the clinical world. \u201cShe\u2019s the velvet hammer in so many ways. She\u2019s this beautiful woman talking in this soft voice about these horrible things. You lose people. That takes a toll. You have very close calls with people. That takes a toll.\u201d\n\nWhiteside was becoming so anxious about her work that she had days when she could hardly sleep or eat. One night after her internship was over, she uncorked a bottle of wine. She drank until she didn\u2019t care if she ever woke up. This scared her. For just a few moments, she realized how it felt to be suicidal.\n\nMonths later, Whiteside met with her therapist to discuss how she could handle these feelings of powerlessness. Whiteside brought up the work of a long-retired psychiatrist and suicide researcher named Jerome Motto. He wasn\u2019t well-known. But Whiteside\u2019s mentor Marsha Linehan was enamored of him because he was the only American to devise an experiment that dramatically reduced suicide deaths. His technique didn\u2019t involve a complicated thousand-page manual to follow or $1 billion in pharmaceutical research and development. All he did was send occasional letters to those at risk.\n\nRight there in therapy, Whiteside found herself spouting out everything she knew about Motto\u2019s approach and career. She began to cry. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat if this is what we should be doing? What if it\u2019s that simple?\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Alanna Vagianos", "title": "Monica Lewinsky Shares New Details Of Her Affair With Bill Clinton", "description": "\"No monkey business happened inside the Oval Office proper,\u201d the former White House intern said in an interview for an upcoming docuseries.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/monica-lewinsky-shares-new-details-of-her-affair-with-bill-clinton_us_5bed757ee4b09f4670078aa1", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bed7f95220000bb04de3ce5.png?cache=V9wJQMKgzi&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T15:00:03Z", "content": "Monica Lewinsky disclosed new details about her White House affair with former President Bill Clinton in an interview for an upcoming A&amp;E docuseries about the scandal. \u201cNo monkey business happened inside the Oval office proper,\u201d Lewinsky said in a clip fr\u2026 [+2073 chars]", "fulltext": "\u201cI\u2019m beginning (just beginning) to consider the implications of the power differentials that were so vast between a president and a White House intern,\u201d she wrote in the essay. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to entertain the notion that in such a circumstance the idea of consent might well be rendered moot.

What I get instead is so unexpected and upsetting I can barely understand it.\n\nMy kid\u2019s bus was attacked by teenagers. They\u2019re now flanked by police cars, getting wounds examined, and giving witness statements.\n\nOver the next half an hour, I piece together what\u2019s happening through texts and phone calls with adrenaline-filled kids in the background. A few stops back, my child says, some teens shot into the bus with Airsoft pistols. Students on the bus hit the floor, unsure if it was the real deal. One person threw a brick into an open window, hitting a kid in the head.\n\nThe bus driver pulled away and went around the corner, pausing to radio dispatch for help. The teens followed on foot, my son tells me, lifting their shirts to flash the Airsoft guns tucked into their waistbands.\n\nThe driver then took the bus about a mile from where the attack had occurred.\n\nI think about how our kids prepare for unimaginable moments from the time they\u2019re tiny kindergartners, making their desks into barricades and hiding quietly in closets. Maybe it\u2019s instinct that tells the kids to hit the deck, or maybe it\u2019s years of hypervigilance and anticipating an inevitable nightmare.\n\nI pull up to my first-grader\u2019s school while still on the phone with my son. I ask him how much longer they are going to be there.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask if I can just walk home, we\u2019re just a couple of blocks from our house now.\u201d\n\nI scan the perimeter of the school for my youngest. I\u2019m too stunned to talk to anyone, and I don\u2019t want to make unnecessary small talk today. I see her and wave. She waits for me to indicate that she can cross the street to where I\u2019m waiting by the car.\n\nI call my partner to tell him what is happening. On the drive, everything is bouncing around in my brain like a game of pinball. Thoughts about why it happened, why someone would do that, and whether our kids are ever safe prevent me from engaging in the usual back-and-forth with my first-grader.\n\nI think about how our kids prepare for unimaginable moments from the time they\u2019re tiny kindergartners, making their desks into barricades and hiding quietly in closets. Maybe it\u2019s instinct that tells kids to hit the deck, or maybe it\u2019s years of hypervigilance and anticipating an inevitable nightmare. Maybe it\u2019s both.\n\nI hope violence never comes to my kids\u2019 schools, but I\u2019m reminded multiple times a year that it can and it might. Even so, I honestly never thought about this kind of thing happening on the bus.\n\nThe drive home takes about five minutes. When I walk through the door, I find my son sitting at the table, watching \u201cFortnite\u201d on his phone, eating a bowl of Frosted Flakes. He doesn\u2019t want to talk about it \u2015 not while he eats and not after. I\u2019m fine, Mom. Well, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m totally overwhelmed by what happened and since he doesn\u2019t want to talk, I go to my bedroom quietly and cry.\n\nPart of me feels like I shouldn\u2019t be so upset. I mean, kids were hit with plastic bullets, not real ones. But I can\u2019t erase the image of terrified kids hitting the floor. I can\u2019t help wondering how much trauma was just slathered onto the existing levels our kids already have \u2015 the trauma that comes from preparing for it, from knowing shootings can happen and sometimes do, from living in an expectation of violence.\n\nOur kids have been conditioned to think anything less than a real shooting is no big deal.\n\nThis is the strange world we live in, where parents have to weigh which acts of violence warrant a reaction and our kids think none do. It\u2019s just a BB gun, Mom. The brick just caused a bump and a little bleeding, Mom. Our kids have been conditioned to think anything less than a real shooting is no big deal.\n\nBut violence of any kind is a big deal. A bus full of school children being terrorized at a stop is a big deal. I don\u2019t want to question myself for thinking that it is. I don\u2019t want my kids to think that any level of that is in any way normal or something they should expect.\n\nThe evening of the incident, we receive a robocall from the school, explaining what happened. The next day, all of the kids on the bus are called out of class to talk with administrators and school counselors about what happened \u2015 a combination session of processing and information-gathering.\n\nA couple of weeks later, I email the principal for an update. He calls to tell me the culprits have all been identified and are going through disciplinary hearings at their schools. It\u2019s harder to get a handle on what is happening through legal channels. Apparently a victim would have to press charges. I\u2019m uncertain if anyone has.\n\nMy middle-schooler probably will ride the bus again. But for now, I\u2019m driving him to school while there\u2019s an investigation. A security officer has been tasked with riding the bus in the interim, and I can\u2019t decide if that\u2019s reassuring or disconcerting. Probably a little bit of both. I don\u2019t want my child caught in the crosshairs if the kids decide to show up again, decide to escalate. A step up from BB guns and bricks is definitely something I don\u2019t want to consider. But, of course, I do.\n\nOur kids need to know what to do in any emergency. They should be prepared to hide or run or get to a safe place or fight back when necessary. But they also need to feel safe, and they definitely need to know that violence at their schools and on their buses and on their walk home is a big deal.\n\nPreparing kids for school shootings is unfortunately necessary, but we need to start having more conversations about what else these drills are teaching our kids about safety, vulnerability and the normalization of violence.\n\nThe weekend after the attack, my son and I listened to \u201cThis American Life\u201d on a long drive. It happened to be the episode \u201cBefore the next one,\u201d which was a chilling look at what is becoming the new normal in school districts across the country: over-the-top, realistic active-shooter drills. After the episode, my kid reminisced about a time in elementary school when the signal went off \u2015 not for a drill but for the real thing \u2015 and how confused and alarmed everyone was. We pieced together that it must have been the time the school was on lockdown during a police chase.\n\nI asked if he ever feels scared about a shooter coming into his school. He said not really, then told me about the vivid fantasies he has about fighting back and escaping and running like hell. \u201cWhat would I do if I were in the bathroom?\u201d he asks. I shudder because I honestly don\u2019t know. I want to scream and pound my fists into the the steering wheel because this is something my kid even needs to think about. \u201cWhat do they tell you to do?\u201d I ask. He says they don\u2019t. So I say his job is to get out. \u201cGet out of the bathroom, get out of the school. Run and don\u2019t look back,\u201d I tell him.\n\nPreparing kids for school shootings is unfortunately necessary, but we need to start having more conversations about what else these drills are teaching our kids about safety, vulnerability and the normalization of violence. I hope to see that conversation happen on a broader, national scale. In the meantime, I\u2019m having more conversations with my own kids about lockdowns and active-shooter drills. I\u2019m asking them about their experiences, how they feel about them, and I\u2019m creating a space for them to talk and for me to listen. I\u2019m hugging them more often, and I\u2019m reminding them that violence is always a big deal and it\u2019s OK to have big feelings about it."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "New York Residents Grapple With Their Gigantic New Roommate, Amazon", "description": "Amazon will bring 25,000 workers with it to NYC. But will this community benefit from those jobs?", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amazon-new-york-jobs_us_5bec4061e4b0783e0a1edc01", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T13:00:14Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "NEW YORK \u2015 Locals are being force-fed a Silicon Valley-sized meal, and all they can hope is that they don\u2019t get poisoned.\n\nThis week, Amazon announced its plans for a gigantic corporate campus in the Queens neighborhood of Long Island City. In a matter of 15 years, this waterfront community of 20,000 will absorb a gargantuan development with 8 million square feet of office space \u2015 the equivalent of three Empire State Buildings, The New York Times points out \u2015 and tens of thousands of daily workers.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon will receive $1.7 billion in incentives from the state and another $1.3 billion from the city, including a taxpayer-funded helicopter pad, just for moving in. In exchange, the company says it will bring around 25,000 new jobs to the area.\n\nAt first blush, Amazon\u2019s promise sounds pretty good \u2015 there are job-seekers all over the state, including in Long Island City, just across the East River from Manhattan.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to apply for a job there!\u201d squealed Jessica Mercado, 32, an operations manager in Long Island City. \u201cI just found out Amazon is coming here, and I was super excited because I already work in the area. I hope that it\u2019s easy to get in, to get hired there.\u201d\n\nBut the tradeoff is a big pill to swallow for the neighborhood, which has already seen rising housing prices, subway overcrowding and rapid gentrification over the last two decades. Amazon\u2019s complex stands to add plenty to that congestion.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just packing more and more people in, more and more residents in, and now you\u2019re gonna add, what, 25,000 workers every day? I don\u2019t see how that works,\u201d said Phil Maurigiannakis, 50, outside a construction shop in Long Island City on Wednesday.\n\nAmazon is great, he said, just not in his backyard.\n\n\u201cI think a facility like that needs a much more suburban neighborhood, farther out, where the roads aren\u2019t crowded, where they can really dedicate the facility to the entire surrounding community. I mean, are they really hiring the local people here?\u201d\n\nHow many of those Amazon jobs will actually benefit Long Island City or the borough of Queens remains unclear.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio argue that the return on investment is 9 to 1 based on the projected job numbers alone. In a joint press release, the two Democrats said the Amazon complex would benefit Long Island City residents directly, including those at the Queensbridge Houses, the largest housing project in the country. Amazon will create an onsite employment center \u201cto connect local residents with jobs and training,\u201d and \u201cexpand tuition-free tech training\u201d to Queensbridge Houses, according to the release.\n\nBut Amazon will draw applicants for many of its open positions from all over the state, and beyond some 1,300 construction jobs, these will be high-end and high-requirement positions, paying an average salary of $150,000, according to a city press release.\n\nNot that locals had any say in the matter. Part of Amazon\u2019s agreement with the city and state will allow it to circumvent City Council \u2015 and Long Island City\u2019s representative on that council, Jimmy Van Bramer \u2015 in the decision-making process regarding the use of local land, according to Curbed.\n\nEssentially, this city, and especially this community, is about to undergo a big experiment it had no say in.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna end well,\u201d said Priya Pe\u00f1a, 21. \u201cThere\u2019s just not enough room for that much growth to happen here. I\u2019m trying to leave before it happens.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s incursion may ruin Pe\u00f1a\u2019s dream of graduating from college and sticking around in Queens, where she grew up, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna have to leave New York City, which fucking sucks!\u201d she said. \u201cI love this city so much, but with all these changes, with all the growth that\u2019s happening, it\u2019s awful for the community.

(AP) \u2014 An Alabama tour bus bound for a Mississippi casino overturned Wednesday on an icy highway, leaving two people dead and 44 others aboard with injuries, authorities said, as a pre-winter storm blasted parts of the South and lower Midwest.\n\nThe National Weather Service says snow and ice fell during the day across parts of Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois. Snow and ice are predicted Thursday and Friday for areas ranging from Ohio and the Appalachian Mountains through Washington, D.C., New York and New England from the storm barreling toward the Northeast.\n\nWitnesses told Mississippi investigators that the bus driver lost control after crossing an icy overpass and the bus rolled over on its driver\u2019s side, coming to rest in median of Interstate 269 in Byhalia around 12:35 p.m., said Mississippi Highway Patrol spokesman Capt. Johnny Poulos. That Mississippi town is about 35 miles southeast of downtown Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nKilled were 70-year-old Betty Russell and 61-year-old Cynthia Hardin, both of Huntsville, Alabama, said DeSoto County Coroner Joshua Pounders. The injured were taken to Memphis-area hospitals, with at least three listed in serious condition Wednesday evening. Officials said the group was bound from Huntsville, Alabama, to gamble at a casino in Mississippi\u2019s Tunica County, about 40 miles to the west.\n\nThe red tour bus with white and gray stripes was later towed from the crash site, its windows mostly missing and a smell of gasoline lingering in the air. Large scratches and other damage were visible on the driver\u2019s side.\n\nPoulos said investigators hadn\u2019t yet concluded how fast the bus was traveling. He said because the road was icy, investigators have no skid marks to evaluate as part of their investigation.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t really tell what the vehicle did,\u201d said Poulos, adding more findings could be available Thursday.\n\nThe bus was operated by Teague VIP Express, based in Anniston, Alabama. The company posted a message on its Facebook page that said: \u201cOur hearts and prayers go out to victims of this tragedy. Please keep everyone involved and families in your prayers.\u201d\n\nThe company has only three buses and three drivers, according to licensing information from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. The agency gives Teague a satisfactory rating and lists no crashes in the last two years.\n\nHowever, agency records show Teague had three buses fail random unannounced inspections in February 2017: One bus was ordered off the road because of worn, welded or missing steering system components and a second bus was ordered off the road because of steering problems and defective or missing axle parts. A third bus was ordered off the road because of a cracked or broken wheel or rim, records show.\n\nA Teague driver was ordered out of service in September 2017 after an Alabama traffic stop found the driver didn\u2019t have the required duty status records, according to the records.\n\nThere was no indication Wednesday\u2019s crash was related to the violations.\n\nFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration spokesman Willam DeBruyne declined to comment on Teague VIP\u2019s safety record. He said a bus is only ordered out of service because of an \u201cimminent hazard.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so egregious that the vehicle cannot be allowed to operate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe coroner declined to describe the causes of the deaths and no autopsies were planned.\n\nIn Washington, National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Keith Holloway said the federal agency hasn\u2019t determined yet whether it will investigate Wednesday\u2019s crash.\n\nIt was the second charter bus excursion to a Mississippi casino town to end in fatalities in two years. A bus carrying Texas senior citizens to a Gulf Coast casino in Biloxi, Mississippi, got stuck on train tracks and was slammed by a freight train in March 2017. The crash resulted in four deaths and 38 injuries. The NTSB found that the probable cause of the crash was the failure of a railroad and the city to work together to improve the safety of a sharply humped railroad crossing where it was well known that vehicles occasionally got stuck.\n\nAround the upper South, meanwhile, the storm spread scattered sleet and light snow. Flash flood watches were posted for parts of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. Freeze warnings were posted as far south as the Gulf Coast. And in Virginia, NASA said, the planned launch early Thursday of an unmanned cargo rocket to the International Space Station had to be rescheduled by one day because of the weather. The unmanned Cygnus cargo craft is now to lift off early Friday from Wallops Island on the Eastern Shore carrying with supplies and research materials for the astronauts aloft."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Lee Moran", "title": "Trump Becomes Twitter Laughingstock Over \u2018Envy Of The World\u2019 Boast", "description": "\"Take it from an outsider: we feel sorry for Americans.\"", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-envy-of-the-world-backfires_us_5bed6075e4b03af892674682", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bed620b2600001703847ba9.jpeg?cache=zflejqzcj1&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T12:34:00Z", "content": "The White House is running very smoothly and the results for our Nation are obviously very good.

Facebook, facing increasing backlash in Washington, hired Definers Public Affairs, a Republican opposition research firm, to discredit anti-Facebook protesters by linking them to figures like Soros, a longtime critic of the social network, the newspaper reported.\n\nFacebook initially worked with Definers to monitor press coverage of the company, but then expanded the relationship in October 2017, according to the report. The public relations firm then reportedly began promoting negative coverage of Facebook\u2019s rivals, including Apple and Google.\n\nDefiners also reportedly targeted Soros after anti-Facebook activists promoted what appeared to be anti-Semitic imagery during a congressional hearing. The firm sent a research document to reporters over the summer alleging that Soros was behind an anti-Facebook movement; his Open Society Foundations, for example, supported a group that his son founded as well as Color of Change, a group whose often partners with an anti-Facebook advocacy group called Freedom From Facebook.\n\nFacebook confirmed that Definers did urge some members of the media to examine the group\u2019s funding, though fiercely rebutted any connection to anti-Semitism.\n\n\u201cThe intention was to demonstrate that it was not simply a spontaneous grassroots campaign, as it claimed, but supported by a well-known critic of our company,\u201d according to a statement. \u201cTo suggest that this was an anti-Semitic attack is reprehensible and untrue.\u201d\n\nTim Miller, a Definers official, expressed his disgust over his company\u2019s actions being viewed as anti-Semitic, stating that the information sent to journalists was all based on public records.\n\n\u201cIm disgusted by the rise of anti-semitism including people who have falsely targeted Soros,\u201d he tweeted Wednesday night. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply deeply personal.

Raab is the second Brexit secretary to quit over May\u2019s plans to leave the EU, the biggest shift in British policy in more than 40 years.\n\nBy leaving now, some suggested that Raab could be positioning himself as a possible successor to May.\n\nBut the prime minister showed little sign of backing down in parliament, where she warned lawmakers they now faced a stark decision - choose to leave with no deal, risk Brexit never happening or back her deal.\n\n\u201cThe choice is clear. We can choose to leave with no deal, we can risk no Brexit at all, or we can choose to unite and support the best deal that can be negotiated,\u201d she said.\n\nShe acknowledged that hammering out an agreement with her cabinet was not \u201ca comfortable process.\u201d\n\nBut she told those lawmakers who believed she could get a deal that did not include a backstop arrangement to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland that they were wrong.\n\nSTRATEGY IN DOUBT\n\nIt was the backstop arrangement, which would see Britain and the EU establishing a single customs territory, that spurred her Brexit secretary and work and pensions minister to resign.\n\n\u201cAbove all, I cannot reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made to the country in our manifesto at the last election,\u201d Raab said.\n\n\u201cThis is, at its heart, a matter of public trust,\u201d Raab said. \u201cI cannot support the proposed deal.\u201d\n\nLess than five months until Britain leaves the EU on March 29, the resignations put May\u2019s Brexit strategy in doubt.\n\nEU leaders are ready to meet on Nov. 25 to sign off on the divorce deal, or Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Edouard Philippe summed up the uncertainty, saying events in London raised concerns about whether the agreement would be ratified. \u201cWe need to prepare ourselves for a no-deal Brexit,\u201d he said.\n\nSome lawmakers in London openly questioned whether May\u2019s government will survive.\n\nOne eurosceptic lawmaker in May\u2019s Conservative Party said more colleagues were either putting in letters to trigger a no confidence vote in her leadership or were increasingly minded to do so. A challenge is triggered if 48 Conservatives write such letters. May could be toppled if 158 of her 315 lawmakers vote against her.\n\n\u2018FALLING APART\u2019\n\nBritain\u2019s opposition Labour Party said the government was \u201cfalling apart.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheresa May has no authority left and is clearly incapable of delivering a Brexit deal that commands even the support of her cabinet, let alone parliament and the people of our country,\u201d said Jon Trickett, a member of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s senior team.\n\nRaab, 44, was appointed to the role of Brexit secretary in July this year following the resignation of his predecessor David Davis, who also quit in protest at May\u2019s Brexit strategy.\n\nAt the heart of Raab\u2019s criticism of May\u2019s deal was the belief that the pursuit of a customs union with the EU would be the \u201cstarting point\u201d for talks on the future relationship with the bloc, \u201cseverely prejudicing\u201d what Britain could achieve.\n\nHe said May\u2019s plan threatened the integrity of Britain and he could not support an indefinite backstop arrangement - to prevent a return to a hard border on the island of Ireland - where the EU had a veto over Britain\u2019s ability to exit.\n\nThe backstop arrangement to come into force if a future trade deal does not prevent the return of a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland has long been the main obstacle not only to a deal with the bloc, but to any agreement of her top ministers.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which props up May in parliament, had threatened to pull its support from the minority government if the backstop meant the province was treated differently from the rest of mainland Britain.\n\n\u201cNo democratic nation has ever signed up to be bound by such an extensive regime, imposed externally without any democratic control over the laws to be applied, nor the ability to decide to exit the arrangement,\u201d Raab said in his resignation letter.\n\nEurosceptics in May\u2019s party have long feared that the prime minister was leading Britain towards a customs union with the EU, something that, they say, would mean a Brexit in name only.\n\nNigel Dodds, the DUP\u2019s deputy leader, welcomed the resignations, praising the ministers for standing up for \u201cthe Union.\u201d\n\n(Additional reporting by Sarah Young, Kate Holton, Guy Faulconbridge; Writing by Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Janet Lawrence)"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Lee Moran", "title": "Jim Carrey Shreds Mark Zuckerberg With Explicit 2-Word Message In Binary", "description": "Carrey is back on the artistic attack against Facebook.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jim-carrey-mark-zuckerberg-binary-message_us_5bed31f7e4b03af89266b745", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bed36ad240000490299b878.jpeg?cache=kctMEDYK7n&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T11:28:35Z", "content": "It translates to: \u201cFuck You.\u201d Carrey also shared a link to a New York Times article documenting how the company\u2019s leaders failed to tackle Russian government-linked activity ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, then sought to obstruct investigations.\u2026 [+166 chars]", "fulltext": "I\u2019m dumping my @facebook stock and deleting my page because @facebook profited from Russian interference in our elections and they\u2019re still not doing enough to stop it.

But they \u2015 and we \u2015 face grave challenges which, if not surmounted, could soon become intractable.\n\nPreeminent now is a looming constitutional crisis. By firing Jeff Sessions and insinuating a constitutionally illiterate puppet as acting attorney general, Trump is preparing to quash or hamstring the Mueller investigation so as to suppress evidence of his own criminal misconduct and that of his associates \u2015 likely including his eldest son. Such an autocratic power grab would pit Trump\u2019s craving for immunity against the democratic imperative that no president subvert the rule of law.\n\nBy itself, this poses an existential threat to constitutional governance. But what makes it so dangerous is an underlying deterioration of our society \u2015 and our democracy \u2015 so severe that the age of Trump could all too swiftly become America\u2019s historic worst.\n\nPut bluntly, America is consuming itself from within. We are riven by tribal hatred and resentment. Lies, insults and unreason corrupt our political dialogue. The lust for partisan dominance paralyzes government and pollutes public policy. Civility becomes weakness; propaganda suffocates fact; fundamentalism suppresses science.\n\nOur faith in basic institutions \u2015 the presidency; the courts; Congress; the media; our schools and colleges \u2015 deteriorates. Climate-driven disasters grow ever more numerous and ferocious. Violence proliferates; a venal gun lobby spreads murderous paranoia. Our common glue crumbles apace.\n\nIn response, contemporary ostriches offer the seductive sedative of historic \u201cperspective.\u201d After all, they tell us, yellow journalism attended our first years; the sainted Thomas Jefferson and John Adams slandered each other; why, in 1856, a pro-slavery congressman pummeled an abolitionist senator with a cane inside the Capitol! Remember the Depression? What about the 1960s?\n\nThis siren song of complacency is insidiously superficial. The agrarian society which spawned Jefferson and Adams was not maddened by social media. Instead of a divisive demagogue, the Depression brought us Franklin Roosevelt. Unresolved resentments from the 1960s \u2015 over race; gender; guns; and culture \u2015 burgeon anew. The existential crisis of the Civil War marked the accession of our greatest president \u2015 and bequeathed racial and geographic fissures now exploited by a leader whose toxic tenure mocks all that Lincoln was.\n\nWhat makes this epoch so incendiary is that our current problems are so multifarious and complex. We are beset by income inequality; global economic change; drastic demographic shifts; and a tsunami of disinformation which mutates disagreement into loathing. We interact with a complex world in ways previously unimaginable \u2015 intensifying dangers that would be irreversible like climate change and nuclear calamity. Our seething contemporary distemper derives from not one division, but many \u2015 racial, geographic, economic, religious, educational, informational, and cultural \u2015 that erode the sense of common citizenship essential to democracy itself.\n\nHeretofore, most Americans viewed rising opportunity, broadly shared, passing from one generation to the next, as the norm. Instead, accelerating income inequality has brought stagnant wages; inadequate health care; the opioid epidemic; the deterioration of family stability; a decline in life expectancy among white Americans; a chasm in political influence between the wealthy and the rest; and a pervasive loss of hope and opportunity among those left behind.\n\nANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty Images Thousands gathered to protest in Washington after President Donald Trump forced the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions last week.\n\nGrowing geographic and class divisions enhance the belief and, increasingly, the reality, that economic and political power belongs to a privileged elite residing in gilded fiefdoms. Gerrymandering and demographic sorting combine with the electoral map to sub-divide America into one-party enclaves whose occupants marinate in mutual alienation. Wealthy donors purchase public policy while financing mendacious media campaigns that exploit tribal resentments to achieve their selfish ends \u2015 joined by a foreign adversary bent on weakening American democracy by choosing America\u2019s president.\n\nInstead of collaborating to arrest our dysfunction, our political parties have become accelerants of disunity \u2015 and, in the case of the GOP, democratic corrosion. Rightly, Democrats address the myriad injustices inflicted on disfavored groups \u2015 the murders of unarmed blacks; discrimination based on gender, ethnicity or sexual preference; callousness toward immigrants and refugees. This demand for equality and universal dignity is essential to genuine democracy \u2015 indeed, to human decency.\n\nBut it cannot, by itself, replace large-scale efforts to create a fair society that embraces all Americans in every state. And at its most insular, the insistence that only members of a disfavored group can grasp that particular group\u2019s grievances defeats the empathy and moral imagination that promotes our shared humanity.\n\nInstead of collaborating to arrest our dysfunction, our political parties have become accelerants of disunity \u2015 and, in the case of the GOP, democratic corrosion.\n\nPurposely destructive to America\u2019s commonweal, however, is the GOP\u2019s insidious reliance on white identity politics. Well before Trump, the party exploited cultural and racial anxiety to attract white voters \u2015 including struggling blue-collar and middle-class Americans whose economic interests they subordinate to that of the Republican business and donor classes.\n\nThis effort combines an increasingly overt racism and xenophobia with the assertion that white Americans are being marginalized and disrespected by the Democrats\u2019 favored subgroups. Indeed, the Republicans suggest, they are subjected to a pervasive racial, economic, cultural and religious shaming: Whether through a suffocating political correctness, the apocryphal war on Christmas, an imaginary flood of non-white immigrants, or displacement in our workplaces or college classrooms, it is whites \u2015 not minorities \u2015 who are the true victims of a discrimination so invidious that, prior to the GOP\u2019s white awakening, they dared not speak its name.\n\nAbsent Republican resistance, the GOP intimates, whites could become a disempowered minority in a multicultural mosh pit as American democracy stabs them in the back. In turn, this racialized rage and paranoia has licensed the now-tribal GOP to attack democratic norms through shameless power politics.\n\nSubverting democracy itself is now indispensable to Republican dominance. That\u2019s the unifying principle for the GOP\u2019s recourse to abusing the filibuster; unleashing money in politics; extreme gerrymandering; blatant voter suppression; stonewalling Merrick Garland; stacking our courts with political partisans; and, in 2016, refusing to acknowledge Russian interference on its behalf. These are the harbingers of a democracy \u2015 and a society \u2015 on the precipice of irreversible decline.\n\nWhich brings us back to Donald Trump.\n\nThis catastrophically unfit president did not force himself on us. He is a product of our own crisis of spirit, abetted by a constitutionally embedded process for electing presidents which has become, however accidentally, anti-democratic. He is not the cause of our societal sickness, but its product.\n\nAnadolu Agency via Getty Images \"He has perfected identity politics in the service of plutocracy.\"\n\nPrior presidential aspirants have been demagogues and racists \u2015 think Huey Long and George Wallace. But only in these debased and fractious times did we elect a man who incited violence at his rallies; threatened to jail his opponent; demonized the media; slandered his opponents; bullied and insulted minorities and women; bragged about sexual assault; lied routinely and transparently; and treated our political institutions with an autocrat\u2019s contempt.\n\nNor has any candidate, including Richard Nixon, exhibited such glaring symptoms of personal pathology \u2015 including a self-absorption so infinite that it obliterates any regard for democratic principles or other human beings.\n\nHis essential character was there for all to see. Even his purported business prowess was a thin veneer concocted on reality TV \u2015 covering a career rooted in recklessness, callousness, dishonesty and baseless braggadocio which bespeak a sociopathy of epic proportions.\n\nNow, as president, he deliberately metastasizes our divisions of ethnicity, sex, race, religion and class to cement the alienation of his followers from their fellow citizens. Spreading meanness is his essential tactic \u2015 he confers dignity on his adherents by demeaning their societal \u201cenemies\u201d while serving the wealthy donors whose passion for tax cuts threatens to shred the social safety net and burden our young with crippling debt. In short, he has perfected identity politics in the service of plutocracy.\n\nAnd autocracy. By further concentrating economic and political power in a privileged few, Trump erodes democracy. His personal and familial self-enrichment corrupts his office and obliterates the legal and ethical safeguards against presidential misconduct. He abuses our military by dispatching combat troops to the southern border in a racist political stunt. He cultivates a cult of personality that encourages magical thinking and casts himself as an indispensable leader whose gifts place him beyond accountability.\n\nHe practices electoral authoritarianism by subverting the right to vote. He undermines faith in our elections through bogus charges of voter fraud. He attacks the media, our courts, law enforcement institutions and the rule of law itself to protect himself from prosecution while pursuing unchecked power.\n\nThat so many Republicans applaud or abet him reflect our slide toward executive immunity and caprice evocative of a banana republic. History tells us that republican virtues, once enfeebled, are not easily revivified.\n\nLittle wonder, then, that Trump now believes that he can ruthlessly strike to place himself above the law \u2015 and that our democracy is too enervated to resist.\n\nWe desperately need Democrats -- because they\u2019re all we\u2019ve got -- to proclaim a creed which appeals to our common humanity.\n\nSo how can Americans restore our social comity and democratic spirit?\n\nNot through a Democratic Party that marshals its forces in a zero-sum game of them versus us, focusing on blue enclaves and treating everyone who reposed their trust in Trump as irretrievably lost. Such Darwinian politics might win elections, but it defeats the ability to govern or to provide a shared vocabulary of hope.\n\nNo doubt salvaging democracy mandates opposing Trump\u2019s excesses without surcease. That means Democrats in Congress and Americans of every stripe must rally to stop Trump from destroying the rule of law \u2015 pursuing justice and accountability for his conduct to the bitter end. Only the trauma of such a divisive battle will prevent the terminal trauma of a president accountable to no one but himself.\n\nBut what then? We desperately need Democrats \u2015 because they\u2019re all we\u2019ve got \u2015 to proclaim a creed which appeals to our common humanity by promoting the collective optimism and security without which no democracy can long survive. That requires more than erecting bulwarks against the crisis Trump would thrust on us \u2015 it demands a determined effort to reanimate American democracy by giving more Americans something better to believe in.\n\nNecessarily, this includes integrating marginalized groups into the fabric of a society that values fairness to all. At a minimum, this means providing early childhood education; universal health care; better schools; affordable college; student debt relief; vocational education for the new economy; consumer protection; higher wages; more equitable taxation; the re-development of depressed areas; curbs on money in politics, monopoly power and financial predation; environmental stewardship; a humane and balanced immigration policy; and a social safety net which includes a decent retirement.\n\nConcurrently, Democrats must facilitate voter participation and ensure the right to vote, making as many Americans as possible shareholders in our democracy. But true democracy cannot be confined to the voting booth \u2015 it must be lived, every day, in the homes and workplaces of Americans empowered to dream for themselves and for their children."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Rebecca Klein", "title": "Experiencing Anti-Semitism Or Racism In School?

There are several factors that determine how a fire spreads across a landscape: wind direction, humidity levels, the moisture content of vegetation, and, as it turns out, wealth.\n\nOver the past five days, the Woolsey fire has turned around 100,000 acres of Ventura and Los Angeles counties into a smoldering hellscape. Photos of Malibu, a coastal city that lay in the fire\u2019s path, show palm trees and multimillion-dollar mansions going up in flames. The fast-moving fire, driven by Southern California\u2019s relentless Santa Ana winds, proved to be a major challenge for firefighters who were unable to control much of the blaze.\n\nThere was, however, one neighborhood that was saved. If you drive about 10 miles north of Malibu and head east on Highway 101, you\u2019ll hit the city of Hidden Hills, a gated community that\u2019s home to many famous celebrities, including hip-hop artist Kanye West and his wife, reality television star Kim Kardashian.\n\nJust like in many of the towns and neighborhoods in this region, Hidden Hills residents were ordered to evacuate their homes as the Woolsey fire approached. But unlike thousands of others, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian did not have to leave their fate up to erratic winds and unpredictable floating embers. They had other options. They called in a team of private firefighters who saved their $60 million mansion and many of the other houses in their neighborhood.\n\nPascal Le Segretain via Getty Images Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are seen in Paris on June 21, 2018.\n\nNow, before going any further, let\u2019s stress a crucial point: In no way is what follows an indictment of this particular action. The fact that this Hidden Hills neighborhood was spared from incineration is a good thing. If any of us had the means to do something similar, it\u2019s likely that we would. But that is the crucial point: if we had the means. The vast majority of us don\u2019t. And therein lies the concern.\n\nUnder capitalism, wealth has always been a determining factor for life outcomes. The wealthiest among us have access to better hospitals, better schools, better grocery stores \u2015 the list could go on for quite some time. Despite our societal penchant for privatized services only available at a premium, though, there are certain realms that remain strictly removed from market forces. Or at least, we thought they were.\n\nAs it happens, there was a time when firefighting was a private, for-profit industry. Through much of the 19th century, firefighting in most big cities was done through private fire brigades \u2015 referred to colloquially as \u201cgangs\u201d \u2015 that would compete with one another to respond to fires. Whichever brigade arrived first would be paid by insurance companies to put out the flames. This competition-based model resulted in territorial disputes and the incentive for brigades to sabotage one another, resulting in many homes and buildings burning down unnecessarily.\n\nAnother common practice at the time was for insurance companies to issue \u201cfire marks\u201d \u2015 metal plaques that would be placed on the outside of property covered by an insurance company.\n\nThese practices started to disappear around the time of the Civil War, when the government began to take over firefighting services. As a society, we had decided that protection from fire should not be commodified \u2015 that it should be a service provided to everyone equally, regardless of wealth or status.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS A firefighter battles a fire along the Ronald Reagan Freeway, aka state Highway 118, in Simi Valley, California, Nov. 12, 2018.\n\nIn another disturbing trend, some insurance companies are offering private wildfire defense services to policyholders who are able to pay a premium. If you\u2019ve got a few thousand dollars to spare, you can sleep a little easier in fire country. And California\u2019s fire country has never been so active.\n\nThe state that was once infamous for its active fault lines has become the land of megafires. With forests that are now filled with trees as flammable as the kiln-dried timber found in lumberyards, what we consider to be fire season has been steadily extended. Last year\u2019s record for the most destructive fire in California\u2019s history was broken this year by the Camp fire in Butte County, which broke out around the same time as the Woolsey fire to the south, and incinerated the entire town of Paradise. This year California also broke 2017\u2019s record for the largest fire in state history.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images An American flag stands among burned rubble in Paradise, California, on Nov. 13. The Camp fire north of Sacramento has killed at least 42 people, injured three firefighters and destroyed 6,500 homes.\n\nThere are a number of factors at work here. Wildfire has always been a normal feature of California\u2019s ecosystems, but a century of misguided fire suppression policies has led to massive buildups of dead litter on the forest floor \u2015 what firefighters call \u201cfuel.\u201d Historically, smaller blazes would clean up this dry vegetation, reducing the fuel load that wildfires use to spread. But these buildups have now led to wildfires burning hotter, faster and longer than ever in the state\u2019s recorded history.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the unprecedented levels of property destruction is the increased amount of development in the wildland-urban interface. This refers to the zone of transition between unoccupied land and human development. There has been more and more development in these areas in recent years, resulting in more homes being destroyed from wildfires.\n\nFinally, perhaps one of the most pressing factors contributing to these megafires is climate change, as rainfall declines and dry winds increase, making wildfires worse. The period between autumn 2011 and autumn 2015 was the driest in California\u2019s history.\n\nWe\u2019ve already reached a 1 degree Celsius increase of average global temperatures, and at this rate, we may be on track for 4 degrees. With climate-fueled disasters growing in severity and frequency, we must examine how these catastrophes will ramify socially and politically.\n\nDecades of neoliberalism have taught us to think of the world purely in terms of individuals.\n\nAs we saw after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005, the contours of a disaster tend to reflect pre-existing divisions \u2015 which are often shaped along racial and class lines. African-American and low-income communities in New Orleans were largely abandoned by recovery efforts, prompting Kanye West\u2019s famous declaration that \u201cGeorge Bush doesn\u2019t care about black people.\u201d\n\nMore recently, the uneven effects of disasters became painfully clear after some people in Puerto Rico were left without power for almost a year after Hurricane Maria hit. And as we learned most recently in California, undocumented immigrants affected by wildfires do not have the same access to Federal Emergency Management Agency relief funding as citizens or permanent residents.\n\nSo, in light of what we know about how disaster relief and recovery play out socially, perhaps it is not all that surprising to hear about the ultra-rich purchasing private firefighting services to protect themselves and their wealthy neighbors. And the point is certainly not to pick on Kanye West, Kim Kardashian or any of the other celebrities and wealthy individuals who have the means to avoid the worst effects of these disasters.\n\nDecades of neoliberalism have taught us to think of the world purely in terms of individuals, but stories like this one cannot be fully grasped at the level of the individual. We must think about them systemically.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS A child's slide and swingset stand behind a home destroyed by the Woolsey fire on Dume Drive in the Point Dume area of Malibu in Southern California, Tuesday, Nov. 13.\n\nThe real injustice in this story is structural inequality. It\u2019s good that Kanye West\u2019s neighborhood was saved. What\u2019s concerning is the context. Wealth shouldn\u2019t mean the difference between a home that burns down and a home that doesn\u2019t. A society where wealth allows one neighborhood to be saved, while a poorer neighborhood goes up in flames because the people there weren\u2019t able to purchase the same resources, is inherently unjust.\n\nAs outlined above, there are innumerable examples of services that are class-restricted or class-limited. But that\u2019s what makes this particular example so important \u2015 it forces us to examine the very nature of privilege within class society. If private firefighting is off-limits, then why not health care? Or education?\n\nThe ultimate realization we are compelled to confront, in the face of private firefighting in Hidden Hills, is one that has plagued class society from its inception. It is a dark and uncomfortable realization, but it is nonetheless threaded through almost all aspects of class society. If we are OK with the wealthy having access to forms of disaster protection that are unavailable to the poor, then we\u2019d have to admit that we, as a society, believe the life of a rich person is worth more than the life of a poor person.\n\nAs climate change bears down on us, we are going to be confronted with this realization over and over. As a society, are we OK with allowing wealth to determine who survives and who dies? As climate change displaces millions \u2015 both internally and as refugees fleeing other countries \u2015 are we OK with a response that consists of gated communities and private security forces? These will be the questions guiding society through the latter parts of the 21st century and beyond.\n\nFor more content and to be part of the \u201cThis New World\u201d community, follow our Facebook page."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Dominique Mosbergen", "title": "Thousand Oaks Bar Owner Says It May Not \u2018Feel Right\u2019 To Reopen After Shooting", "description": "Brian Hynes said he's unsure about reopening the Borderline Bar & Grill, though he's expressed hope that the bar can come back \"stronger\" than ever.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/borderline-bar-thousand-oaks-brian-hynes_us_5bed166ee4b09f467006ab39", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bed2eee2600000503847b88.jpeg?cache=UZ7L4LFbzx&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T10:38:41Z", "content": "The future of the Borderline Bar &amp; Grill, a popular watering hole and safe haven for many in the Thousand Oaks, California, community, has been thrown into doubt following a mass shooting at the dance hall that left 13 people dead.

It is now the largest outbreak that the DRC has ever seen \u2015 with 341 probable and confirmed cases \u2015 and the third largest Ebola outbreak in history. And it\u2019s continuing to expand.\n\nWhile the risk of it spreading globally remains low, the threat for the country and its neighbors is very high. Constant incidents of rebel violence in the war-torn region, the resulting community protests and community resistance to medical intervention have hampered the ability of the World Health Organization, the DRC\u2019s Ministry of Health and various non-governmental organizations to respond.\n\nIn response to an Aug. 24 incident, the U.S. pulled response team members back from the epicenter in North Kivu to the DRC capital of Kinshasa hundreds of miles away. The American response effort is now concentrated in Kinshasa and neighboring countries, and U.S. officials said in a briefing Wednesday that the situation is currently too dangerous for them to go back to North Kivu.\n\nContainment efforts in this outbreak have also been made more difficult because a majority of the newest cases are not appearing among known contacts of other Ebola patients, said Dr. Peter Salama, the WHO\u2019s head of emergency response.\n\nIn fact, over the last 30 days, two-thirds of the reported cases of the infectious disease have come from unknown contacts, according to Pierre Rollin, a top Ebola expert at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That\u2019s 85 cases out of 129.\n\nLast week, Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, warned of the possibility of an \u201cendemic\u201d version of Ebola \u2015 where the virus is not extinguished but continues to spread over an indefinite period of time among the population of North Kivu. Public health officials have argued that everything must be done to prevent the horror of continuous transmission of Ebola \u2015 a situation that has never previously been seen.\n\nThis [Ebola outbreak] is going to get out of control fast. ... We are on the edge of crisis. J. Stephen Morrison, director of CSIS's Global Health Policy Center\n\nYet under a best-case scenario, Salama said the outbreak could be stopped within six months at the earliest. That\u2019s a significantly different assessment from that being made by the CDC.\n\n\u201cWhere we absolutely agree, this is arguably the absolutely most difficult context that we\u2019ve ever faced for stopping an Ebola outbreak,\u201d Salama told HuffPost. Global health leaders have had to re-evaluate many of the usual control tactics for battling the hemorrhagic fever, he said, because they\u2019re now dealing with a massive displaced population in a war zone \u2015 a situation that Salama has repeatedly described as a \u201cperfect storm.\u201d\n\nRon Klain, the Ebola czar under then-President Barack Obama, disagrees with that last characterization of a \u201cperfect storm.\u201d While Ebola has never been fought in a war zone before, he argues that this is the \u201cnew normal,\u201d not a one-off situation, in an era of increasing outbreaks of the highest risk.\n\n\u201cWe are going to increasingly see these disease outbreaks in troubled areas with histories of conflict, with refugees nearby, with difficult political situations because that\u2019s what more and more of the world itself looks like,\u201d Klain said.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just treat this as some sort of flukish perfect storm of horrible facts that we\u2019ll just have to deal with this one time and not ever again,\u201d he said.\n\nSalama acknowledges that 80 percent of serious disease outbreaks are occurring in fragile state settings. And his more optimistic take on controlling the Ebola outbreak comes with this caveat: \u201cas long as the security holds.\u201d\n\nWar Zone Nightmare\n\nSince the outbreak began in North Kivu at the end of July, attacks by rebel groups and community demonstrations have hampered the public health response, repeatedly driving response workers into lockdown and stopping vaccination efforts and contact tracing.\n\nThere have been at least 20 major security incidents of various kinds since the start of the outbreak, including one this past weekend, Salama said at a briefing Wednesday morning at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). All of these incidents have \u201cset us back,\u201d he said.\n\nJeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow for the Washington-based Center for Global Development who previously led parts of the 2014 Ebola response for the Obama administration, stressed that no matter how effective the current response is, each rebel attack derails containment efforts.\n\n\u201cEvery time we\u2019re seeing one of these attacks, case monitoring is badly disrupted and drops off, people flee, and you see a corresponding increase in cases the following week,\u201d Konyndyk said. \u201cThat means no matter how much progress we think is being made, it\u2019s only as durable as the security situation allows it to be.\u201d\n\nRead more about the security situation in North Kivu here: \u201cExperts Said A War Zone Ebola Outbreak Would Be A Nightmare. It\u2019s Been Even Worse.\u201d\n\nThe violence has led to a wave of new cases that began at the end of September. U.S. government and WHO officials say there has been increased coordination with the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a peacekeeping force has been deployed in the area for years. MONUSCO (an acronym based on its name in French) is the U.N.\u2019s largest peacekeeping mission, yet many are still concerned that the region\u2019s violence will continue.\n\nThe threat of further attacks and protests in the lead-up to what were already expected to be contentious presidential, regional and legislative elections in the DRC on Dec. 23 is worrying global health leaders.\n\nJ. Stephen Morrison, the director of CSIS\u2019s Global Health Policy Center who led a panel discussion at the think tank\u2019s event, told HuffPost that \u201cwe are kidding ourselves\u201d if people think the situation is going to improve soon.\n\n\u201cThis [Ebola outbreak] is going to get out of control fast. Just look at the pattern of ADF hits and our inability to stop it,\u201d he argued, referring to one of the two rebel groups responsible for the vast majority of the violence. \u201cWe are on the edge of crisis.\u201d\n\nThe ultimate fear \u2015 what Salama called a \u201cgame-changer\u201d \u2015 would be a directed attack against outside workers with the WHO or the NGOs who came to help. There have already been multiple attacks on local responders, including volunteers with the Red Cross, and two unarmed members of the DRC\u2019s Medical Immediate Response Unit were killed.\n\nSince the North Kivu region is currently labeled a Level 4 U.N. security threat, some sort of direct attack on outside medical responders would trigger a Level 5 label and result in evacuation of those forces \u2015 which would be catastrophic for efforts to contain the outbreak.\n\nThat\u2019s a frightening scenario, said Rear Adm. Tim Ziemer, who is currently serving as the U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s acting assistant administrator in the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance.\n\n\u201cWe probably ought to be having a side meeting at a very high level to address what are the implications of that and what does that require all of us to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be blind and turn our back on this current challenge, as turning our back on it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to go away,\u201d he added.\n\nZiemer previously served as the head of global health security at the National Security Council, which is coordinating the U.S. response to the DRC outbreak. Observers have argued that national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s decision to reshuffle that agency earlier this year diminished the power of global health security experts in the Trump White House.\n\nThe State Of U.S. Leadership\n\nWhile global health experts still commend the U.S. for its financial and logistical response to the outbreak \u2015 and credit it with the experimental but already invaluable Merck vaccine against Ebola, which more than 30,000 people have received in this outbreak alone \u2015 some wonder whether there is a new status quo in global health leadership.\n\n\u201cThey are leading from behind,\u201d said Klain, noting the U.S. deference to other stakeholders on issues of security and the on-the-ground situation in North Kivu.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same kind of leadership from the U.S. in a global health crisis that we have seen previously in Democratic and Republican administrations,\u201d Klain added, citing Obama\u2019s Ebola response and George W. Bush\u2019s efforts to fight HIV/AIDS in Africa. \u201cFor an administration that likes to talk about \u2018America first,\u2019 their approach to Ebola has been \u2018America is one of many.\u2019\u201d\n\nWe can\u2019t be blind and turn our back on this current challenge, as turning our back on it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to go away. Rear Adm. Tim Ziemer, a senior USAID official\n\nThe fact that U.S. response teams aren\u2019t at the epicenter of the outbreak now is reflective of a \u201cBenghazi hangover,\u201d Konyndyk argued, suggesting that no one in the current administration who is focused on the outbreak has enough influence to lobby Bolton, much less President Donald Trump, on this critical issue.\n\n\u201cThere is no substitute for being there,\u201d Konyndyk said.\n\nThe lack of an overarching global leadership beside the WHO is also concerning to him. \u201cAt a certain point, a response becomes more complex than what WHO can manage on its own,\u201d Konyndyk said.\n\nIndeed, during the 2014 West Africa outbreak, the WHO was excoriated for its foot-dragging. U.S. attention and resources were ultimately pivotal to ramping up the global response. And still, that epidemic killed 11,300 and infected 28,600 more.\n\nMorrison hopes that global leaders aren\u2019t fretting away the time like they did from February to August 2014 before taking definitive action.\n\nAt The Ebola Epicenter\n\nIn the epicenter of the outbreak, the city of Beni, the spread of Ebola has been driven by transmission of the illness in the \u201ctradi-modern\u201d facilities, according to Salama. Practices in these 300 or so health care centers, which combine traditional healing with modern medicine, are not optimal. Workers are reusing needles and there are no records of whom they treat.\n\nA concurrent malaria outbreak is driving many \u2015 especially children \u2015 to the health centers. The WHO theory is that there they come into contact with infectious Ebola patients or are given injectables with the same needles used on Ebola patients. Without records, tracing contacts among the population of those exposed through the tradi-modern system is extremely difficult.\n\nThat\u2019s a critical insight about the spread of the disease, but the WHO first suggested it almost a month ago to STAT. Given all the other challenges of fighting Ebola in an unstable urban community of 200,000 people, it\u2019s not clear this theory is enough to quell the outbreak anytime soon.\n\nKlain said it also sounds like something he\u2019s spotted over the last few weeks in the WHO\u2019s public statements: \u201cthe beginning of a hint of excuse-making.\u201d That\u2019s a shame, he said, considering the organization has made massive strides since its fatally slow response in 2014 and that until recently it \u201cshould be commended\u201d for its forthrightness about the severity of the DRC situation.\n\nThe bottom line is that this Ebola outbreak is still expanding, not contracting, into new areas \u2015 a total of 14 health zones of significant geographic size, as of Wednesday\u2019s Ministry of Health report \u2015 and infecting new, unidentified people.\n\n\u201cRight now, the position of global public health authorities should be we have an outbreak that is spreading in every conceivable way it can spread and we don\u2019t have a grip on it,\u201d Klain said. \u201cAnd until you have a grip on it, you just don\u2019t.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Luke O'Brien", "title": "Montana Judge: Neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin Can\u2019t Hide Behind First Amendment", "description": "The Daily Stormer publisher and his alt-right trolls suffer another setback in court.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/neo-nazi-andrew-anglin-first-amendment-judge-whitefish_us_5becc692e4b0dbb7ea66fa14", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a612dc71f00009a00db96d1.jpeg?cache=qhqMp44g32&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T02:19:58Z", "content": "A Montana federal judge on Wednesday ruled that a Jewish woman\u2019s lawsuit against Andrew Anglin, the publisher of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website, cannot be dismissed on First Amendment grounds, dealing a major blow to Anglin, who had hoped to use a free sp\u2026 [+5064 chars]", "fulltext": "Andrew Anglin Andrew Anglin gives the Nazi salute in Rome.\n\nA Montana federal judge on Wednesday ruled that a Jewish woman\u2019s lawsuit against Andrew Anglin, the publisher of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website, cannot be dismissed on First Amendment grounds, dealing a major blow to Anglin, who had hoped to use a free speech defense to shield himself from liability for an anti-Semitic harassment campaign he orchestrated.\n\nTanya Gersh, a real estate agent in Whitefish, Montana, sued Anglin in April 2017 claiming invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of \u201cemotional distress\u201d and violation of a Montana anti-intimidation law. The lawsuit accuses Anglin of using his website, which is a key radicalization hub for the white supremacist movement, to target Gersh, who had become involved in a real estate dispute with Sherry Spencer, the mother of white nationalist Richard Spencer.\n\nGersh and her family, including her 12-year-old son, received more than 700 threatening and harassing communications from Anglin\u2019s readers, whom he has dubbed his Stormer Troll Army.\n\n\u201cDay of the rope soon for your entire family,\u201d said one.\n\n\u201cSix million are only the beginning,\u201d said another.\n\nThe trolls played Gersh recordings of gunshots when she answered her phone. Anglin posted images of her and her son superimposed over the gates of Auschwitz and threatened to hold an armed neo-Nazi march through the small ski town where Gersh lives. When Gersh sued Anglin a few months later with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, he went on the run. According to his attorney, Marc Randazza, Anglin is now based in a secret overseas location.\n\nRandazza, who represents numerous other far-right extremists and often resorts to their trollish tactics in the courtroom, filed a motion a year ago to dismiss the Gersh case on the grounds that everything Anglin had published on his site \u2015 such as contact information for Gersh and her family, along with instructions on how to harass her and content with which to harass her \u2015 was protected speech. Randazza contended that Anglin could not be held liable for the speech of others, even it was unprotected.\n\nIn May, however, a magistrate judge found that Anglin\u2019s \u201ctroll storm\u201d deserved no First Amendment protection and recommended that the motion to dismiss be denied. On Wednesday, Chief Judge Dana L. Christensen of the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana agreed with the magistrate judge and denied the motion.\n\nIn his order, Christensen shot down Anglin\u2019s argument that Gersh is a limited public figure and that Gersh had \u201cinjected herself\u201d into a matter of public concern by arguing with Sherry Spencer over the sale of a building in Whitefish owned by Spencer.\n\nChristensen found that Anglin\u2019s speech \u201cinvolved a matter of strictly private concern\u201d and that Anglin\u2019s argument that it was of public concern may have been intended to mask an attack over a private matter and insulate the neo-Nazi from liability for exploiting his readers\u2019 prejudices to target Gersh. Publishing information about an alleged real estate dispute that Gersh did not initiate and giving her contact information did nothing to inform the public about a matter of public concern and was instead based on Anglin\u2019s \u201cpersonal hostilities,\u201d according to the judge.\n\nThe harm alleged by Gersh is precisely the type of harm not only anticipated but requested by Anglin in his Daily Stormer posts. U.S. District Judge Dana L. Christensen\n\n\u201cAnglin launched a campaign of unrelated personal attacks on a Whitefish realtor, her husband, and their son because of a perceived conflict between Gersh and the mother of Anglin\u2019s friend, another white supremacist,\u201d Christensen wrote. \u201cAlthough Anglin drew heavily on his readers\u2019 hatred and fear of ethnic Jews, rousing their political sympathies, there is more than a colorable claim that he did so strictly to further his campaign to harass Gersh.\u201d\n\nFor the same reason, Christensen also found that Anglin could be held liable for authorizing and directing his readers\u2019 threatening and harassing messages to Gersh, who at one point was so terrified that she considered fleeing Whitefish with her family. Anglin knew what his readers were doing. In a series of posts over several weeks, he urged them to keep it up.\n\n\u201c[T]he harm alleged by Gersh is precisely the type of harm not only anticipated but requested by Anglin in his Daily Stormer posts,\u201d Christensen wrote.\n\nHuffPost has reached out to Anglin and Randazza for comment and will update this article if they respond.\n\nA serial harasser and slanderer, Anglin routinely advocates violence against Jews, minorities, women, journalists and other groups. He has bragged on The Daily Stormer about his influence on Dylann Roof, who killed nine black people in a Charleston, South Carolina, church in 2015. He has called for \u201can end to what is known as the United States of America.\u201d\n\nFor Anglin and the entirety of the far-right, which has for years relied on its ability to use the internet and social media to form harassment mobs and terrorize their perceived enemies, the Gersh case is a pivotal lawsuit that could determine whether the extremists can continue to use the First Amendment as cover for their malevolent actions."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Carla Herreria", "title": "Trump Endorses Bipartisan Criminal Justice Reform Bill", "description": "The bill, backed by Trump's senior adviser Jared Kushner, would bring major changes to the federal prison system.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-criminal-justice-reform-bill_us_5becac70e4b03af892664e4e", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5beccd5f2100005204ca2698.jpeg?ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T02:13:12Z", "content": "President Donald Trump has announced his support for a bipartisan prison reform bill that would overhaul prison sentencing laws in the U.S. Trump endorsed the so-called First Step Act at the White House on Wednesday, saying the bill would \u201cmake our communitie\u2026 [+2750 chars]", "fulltext": "Trump endorsed the so-called First Step Act at the White House on Wednesday, saying the bill would \u201cmake our communities safer and give former inmates a second chance at life after they have served their time.\u201d\n\nThe bill, which Trump\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner has been advocating for months, also \u201cincludes reasonable sentencing reforms while keeping dangerous and violent criminals off the street,\u201d Trump added.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all better off when former inmates can receiver and re-enter society as law-abiding, productive citizens,\u201d the president said.\n\nThe bill is one of the first major overhauls of prison sentencing laws in decades.

Brands like Adidas, Rothy\u2019s and Veja are just a few that are incorporating materials made of recycled plastic in their shoes. Plastic isn\u2019t great for the environment: It\u2019s harmful to wildlife and coral reefs, and there\u2019s a good chance we humans are consuming plenty of it ourselves.\n\nBy repurposing plastic waste, brands aim to give it life beyond the landfill and prevent it from causing more harm than is already done, all while putting their products in a positive light.\n\nTurning plastic bottles into sneakers isn\u2019t a one-step process. To find out exactly how it\u2019s done, we asked experts for some insight.\n\nWhere does the plastic come from, and how does it become shoes?\n\nThere are a number of steps involved in the process of turning plastic \u2015 bottles or otherwise \u2015 into the fibers used to create knit shoes, like the ones made by Rothy\u2019s or Adidas x Parley.\n\nFirst, the plastic needs to be collected. (There\u2019s more than 6 billion metric tons of plastic waste in the world, according to a 2017 article published by National Geographic, so brands using it as their raw material have a generous supply.) Veja, a French footwear brand with a focus on company transparency, uses plastic collected from the streets of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo to create the B-Mesh fabric used on some of its shoes. Rothy\u2019s, an American footwear brand, gets recycled plastic from a U.S. supplier that sources it from all over. That plastic is then turned into the brand\u2019s proprietary yarn, used for the uppers of all its shoes. Parley, which has partnered with Adidas since 2015, uses ocean plastic \u2015 collected from beaches and coastal communities before it reaches the ocean \u2015 to replace virgin plastic in the production of Adidas x Parley sneakers.\n\nOnce the plastic has been gathered, the process of turning it into long strands of yarn can begin. As Erin Lowenberg, creative director at Rothy\u2019s, explained, plastic is heated into chips, then reduced to form small pellets, which are then extruded through machines to become \u201creally long, easy fibers that become soft but also very durable,\u201d she said, comparing it to dental floss.\n\nVeja\u2019s manufacturing process (you can see a glimpse of it in the video below) is similar: The plastic is collected, sorted and then turned into plastic flakes, which then become polyester fiber through an extrusion process, the brand\u2019s co-founder, Fran\u00e7ois Ghislain Morillion, told HuffPost via email.\n\nHow much plastic is actually used to make a shoe?\n\nWith so much waste in the world, how much of a dent do companies using recycled plastic actually make?\n\nAccording to Adidas, every pair of shoes made with the Parley Ocean Plastic prevents 11 bottles from making their way into the oceans. The sportswear brand sold 1 million pairs of Parley shoes in 2017, an Adidas representative confirmed to HuffPost via email. According to its website, that means it retrieved at least 11 million bottles from coastal areas. The rep also told HuffPost that the brand aims to sell 5 million pairs of its Parley shoes in 2018 and 11 million pairs in 2019.\n\nLowenberg said Rothy\u2019s has already used almost 20 million bottles in the production of its shoes, which is impressive considering the brand has only been selling them for about two years. Looking at things on a smaller scale, Morillion said each pair of Veja sneakers made with B-Mesh uses three water bottles on average.\n\nIs recycled plastic a good long-term solution?\n\nUsing plastic waste to create new, useful products might seem like a great solution right now, but some have questioned whether the immediate benefits will have a lasting positive effect.\n\nPlastic is plastic. As Morillion said, \u201cUsing recycled polyester lessens our dependence on petroleum as a source of raw materials but is not a biodegradable material, like organic cotton or leather.\u201d\n\nEven if plastic is being repurposed into new things like sneakers, there\u2019s always a chance it will end up back in landfills, once again creating waste. (Then there\u2019s the issue of microplastics \u2015 small plastic pieces that are less than 5 millimeters long \u2015 which are also said to be harmful to our oceans and wildlife.)\n\nC\u00e9line Semaan, founder of Slow Factory, an innovation lab focused on sustainable practices, and a member of the board of directors of AIGA NY, told HuffPost that, in the short term, collecting plastic and turning it into knits and fabrics, like the varieties used in footwear, appears to be helpful. But in the long term, she argued, it might not be.\n\n\u201cIf we are going to look at it like the Earth is going to end next week, yes, it\u2019s a great idea. But if we are looking at it in terms of longevity and what happens next, that\u2019s when it\u2019s problematic,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is helpful to remove the bottles and the plastic from the ocean that was not supposed to be there in the first place. These efforts are and should be rewarded.\u201d\n\nThe problem, she suggested, is when the cycle ends with the production of a new product that comes with no intention of repurposing it multiple times.\n\n\u201cIt is problematic,\u201d Semaan said. \u201c[Plastic] itself is a toxic material. Whatever we do with it is going to be problematic unless we think about it in a way that it\u2019s going to be circular, to be reused again and again and not end up in landfills.\u201d\n\nOne of the most innovative things a company can do, Semaan suggested, is take responsibility for the materials and products it puts out into the world and ask consumers to return them so they can be recycled or disposed of responsibly.\n\nAccording to Lowenberg, Rothy\u2019s is working toward that. Thinking about long-term solutions, she said, is part of the brand\u2019s business model, though she acknowledged that the global issue of plastic waste won\u2019t be solved by a single company. For their part, though, Rothy\u2019s shoes are completely recyclable, and customers can return them through the brand\u2019s partnership with PLUSfoam to make sure they\u2019re disposed of properly.\n\nAdidas has a \u201cTake Back\u201d program in place as well, allowing customers to return their used Adidas shoes at participating locations so they can be properly recycled and potentially reused. (It should be noted that the \u201cTake Back\u201d program isn\u2019t currently an option in every Adidas store.)\n\nThough Veja doesn\u2019t currently have a recycling program in place \u2015 its shoes are made of different materials, which have different recycling processes \u2015Morillion said the brand is \u201cactively looking for solutions to devise a \u2018cradle to cradle\u2019 solution to reach 100 percent recycling.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor us, recycled plastics are just a part of the solution,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen talking about plastic and its effect on our planet, debates will always arise. Solutions to large-scale problems are seldom perfect. Repurposing recycled plastic is no exception. But it\u2019s a start."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Sarah Ruiz-Grossman", "title": "Ryan Zinke Says CA Wildfires Are Getting Worse But Won\u2019t Say \u2018Climate Change\u2019", "description": "The interior secretary said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of reasons for a fire\u201d and \u201cnow is not the time to point fingers.\u201d", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/interior-secretary-ryan-zinke-california-fires-climate-change_us_5beca3e1e4b09f46700663f7", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5beca5372600005801847b67.jpeg?cache=L1yEa3gtoM&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-15T00:29:48Z", "content": "After Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke visited Northern California communities hit by the Camp fire, the deadliest in state history, he acknowledged that wildfires are getting worse in the Golden State but managed to not say the words \u201cclimate change\u201d once. \u201c[Fi\u2026 [+3332 chars]", "fulltext": "After Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke visited Northern California communities hit by the Camp fire, the deadliest in state history, he acknowledged that wildfires are getting worse in the Golden State \u2015 but managed to not say the words \u201cclimate change\u201d once.\n\n\u201c[Fire] season is getting longer, the temperatures are getting hotter,\u201d Zinke said at a press conference Wednesday with California Gov.
