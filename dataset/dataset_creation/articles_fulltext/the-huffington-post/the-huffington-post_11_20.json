About 80 percent of those who joined the caravans this year came from Honduras, where chronic violence and political crisis have forced them to flee for safety.\n\nTrump even said at one point that he might send as many as 15,000 troops to the border, far exceeding the number of people in the caravans."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Kimberley Richards", "title": "Teigen Asks Michael B.

What happened next is reportedly recorded on an audiotape possessed by Turkish intelligence and shared with the U.S., which captures in horrific detail the utter contempt for human rights that Khashoggi decried.\n\nAwaiting Khashoggi was a 15-man Saudi death squad studded with agents tied to the crown prince, including its leader, Maher Mutreb. The murder was neither random nor merciful: The killers severed Khashoggi\u2019s fingers, cut off his head and dismembered his body with a bone saw. One of them, a doctor of forensics, advised listening to music on headphones to ease the stress of butchery. Thereafter, depending on the account, the murderers either gave the dismembered corpse to a \u201clocal cooperator\u201d or dissolved it in acid before flushing it down a drain.\n\nThat MBS ordered this atrocity is beyond serious doubt. Since his accession, he has pushed to arrest, kidnap or otherwise forcibly repatriate dissenters living abroad.\n\nThat his targets included a middle-aged journalist is confirmed by intelligence intercepts. Days before the murder, at the direction of MBS, his brother \u2015 the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. \u2015 advised Khashoggi to obtain the marriage documents from the Saudi consulate, assuring him of his safety. Shortly after supervising the assassination, Mutreb called a top aide to MBS, Saud al- Qahtani, saying \u201ctell your boss\u201d that the mission was accomplished. Given that MBS rules with absolute authority, the CIA concludes that such a complex and risky operation \u2015 involving 15 agents flying on government aircraft to execute a perceived enemy at a Saudi consulate on foreign soil \u2015 would proceed only at MBS\u2019 specific direction.\n\nNor would any serious observer put it past him. Granted, MBS initially swathed his megalomania in cosmetic reforms, such as allowing women to drive. Having forgotten his rapturous declaration that the Iraq war would democratize the Middle East, Thomas Friedman predicted that MBS\u2019 reforms, if successful, \u201cwill not only change the character of Saudi Arabia but the tone and tenor of Islam across the globe,\u201d and praised his \u201cfirehose of new ideas for transforming his country.\u201d The real firehose was Saudi Arabia\u2019s $27 million lobbying campaign to beatify MBS in Washington.\n\nFAYEZ NURELDINE via Getty Images That Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of Washington Post writer Jamal Khashoggi is beyond doubt.\n\nBut MBS was so profligate in acts of ruthless impulsivity that he revealed himself as a dangerously destabilizing force in an all-too-volatile region. To seize power, he brutally deposed his cousin, then arbitrarily arrested scores of relatives, subjecting them to extortion, abuse and, in one case, death from torture.\n\nHe kidnapped the Lebanese prime minister, forcing his resignation in a pathetic hostage video after subjecting him to physical abuse; imprisoned human rights activists, including women who had campaigned for the right to drive, and when Canada protested their fate, he expelled its ambassador. He roiled the region by organizing an ill-considered blockade of Qatar.\n\nMost terribly, he has conducted a ghastly military campaign against Iranian proxies in Yemen, a rolling war crime that escalated the slaughter and starvation of civilians into the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disaster \u2015 all while spending vast sums acquiring yachts and artistic masterpieces.\n\nDespite all the damning evidence of his character, Donald Trump now says of MBS \u201cmaybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t,\u201d announcing that the U.S. would impose no further sanctions on Saudi Arabia or the crown prince for Khashoggi\u2019s murder. The capitulation is a low point of his presidency, exposing the limitlessness of Trump\u2019s moral, psychological and geopolitical failings.\n\nHow did we get here? In any normal presidency, an autocrat so devoid of external or internal constraints would provoke extreme caution \u2015 and require unrelenting scrutiny of his role in Khashoggi\u2019s murder.\n\nInstead, from the beginning the callow princeling Jared Kushner fantasized that he and MBS could remake the Middle East, commencing intimate communications sometimes conducted outside normal channels. At Kushner\u2019s urging, Trump made Saudi Arabia his first foreign visit, gorging himself on flattery as Kushner and MBS oversold the Saudis as indispensable allies against their mutual b\u00eate noire, Iran. Thus began America\u2019s slide into the cesspool of complicity with the vicious mad prince.\n\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters Trump made Saudi Arabia his first foreign visit as president. He and his son-in-law Jared Kushner met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nReportedly, MBS has bragged that he has Kushner in his pocket \u2015 indeed, that Kushner gave him intelligence information that helped him target domestic enemies. The course of events provides abundant affirmation.\n\nRemarkably America remained passive when MBS hijacked Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, jailed human rights activists and rebuked Canada. Trump supported MBS\u2019 blockade against Qatar and, reprehensibly, his despoliation of Yemen. The series of Saudi lies about Khashoggi is so transparent that they convey but one truth: that MBS regards Trump and Kushner with the same contempt he holds for human life.\n\nHere\u2019s the preposterous sequence of Saudi untruths as compiled by the BBC.\n\nOct. 3: Khashoggi left the consulate alive.\n\nOct. 8: Reports of his death are baseless.\n\nOct. 15: As relayed by Trump himself, Khashoggi may have been murdered by \u201crogue killers.\u201d\n\nOct. 19: The journalist died during a fistfight with 15 Saudis who, in their collective bemusement, tried \u201cto conceal what happened.\u201d\n\nOct. 20: The \u201cmurder\u201d (such an ugly word) was a mistake unknown to senior Saudi officials.\n\nOct. 25: It was a premeditated killing carried out without the knowledge of MBS.\n\nNov. 15: The killers made a spur-of-the-moment decision to conceal Khashoggi\u2019s accidental death by spontaneously cutting him into pieces \u2015 no doubt prompted by the accidental presence of a coroner with a bone saw. After all, the Saudi foreign minister said philosophically, \u201csometimes mistakes happen.\u201d\n\nDo they ever. Fortuitously for MBS, the top Saudi prosecutor has ordered up the death penalty for five of the murderers \u2015 a diversionary show trial designed to silence all 15 participants by execution or intimidation. To further enlist America in his cover-up, MBS informed Kushner and national security adviser John Bolton that Khashoggi was a security threat and, according to The Wall Street Journal, told Kushner in a rage that he would \u201clook elsewhere for foreign partners\u201d if he were \u201cbetrayed by the West.\u201d Effectively, MBS demanded from the United States the absolute immunity from consequence that Trump desires for himself.\n\nIn compliance, Trump signaled that MBS need only to maintain oil prices and stand by the Saudi\u2019s illusory $110 billion arms purchase from the U.S. \u2015 bartering our humanity for cash. Thus, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s proposed confrontation with MBS degenerated into a craven 15-minute photo opportunity awash in joviality.\n\nTrump\u2019s cosmetic sanctions against 17 Saudis implicated in the gruesome plot, a palliative meant to further insulate MBS from congressional outrage, accompanies a coldblooded calculation worthy of a Mafia don \u2015 and morally repulsive in an American president. For years, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has sought to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a political opponent who has long been a legal resident of the United States. According to NBC, Trump has considered facilitating Gulen\u2019s extradition should Erdogan ease Turkey\u2019s pressure on MBS over Khashoggi. In short, Trump would send one legal U.S. resident to almost certain death in Turkey to help MBS conceal his murder of another.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nTrump\u2019s entire response to the murder has consisted of lying and dissembling to protect MBS. Tuesday\u2019s statement once again feigned ignorance of the CIA\u2019s finding that MBS ordered the assassination \u2015 even though Trump has seen the evidence. Worse, he absolved MBS and his regime of any further consequences. Through these cynical and deliberate acts of dereliction, America\u2019s president has become an accessory after the fact to Khashoggi\u2019s murder.\n\nIn moral terms, Trump is telling MBS that he can flout human rights, undertake dangerous regional adventurism, repress dissent and murder those who displease him with impunity. But even as realpolitik, Trump\u2019s complicity is feckless.\n\nAs usual, our presidential apprentice is bargaining against himself: The Saudis need our military hardware, the best in the world, and America is energy self-sufficient. An end to military assistance would ground the Saudi air force; the threatened oil boycott would wind up benefiting America and devastating the Saudi oil industry. Moreover, once King Salman dies, some within the Saudi royal family reportedly hope to replace MBS with a saner man, his uncle. Given all that, any competent president would figure out how to use our leverage to separate the interests of Saudi Arabia from those of Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nAs matters stand, Congress must take the lead. One obvious measure is to cut off support for the murderous Saudi campaign in Yemen \u2015 a horror that bears America\u2019s fingerprints \u2015 and support a U.N. inquiry into war crimes by both sides. If America saves innocent lives by kneecapping Saudi brutality, Jamal Khashoggi will not have died for nothing.\n\nBeyond that, Congress must act to strip the cover from MBS. Specifically, they should push for an international investigation into Khashoggi\u2019s murder; commence a congressional investigation into the Trump administration\u2019s dealings with MBS, both in response to Khashoggi and since the onset of the administration; and suspend Americans arms sales to Saudi Arabia until these inquiries conclude."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": null, "title": "Thousands Of Northern California Fire Survivors Take Refuge In Tent Cities", "description": "These Northern Californians have lost their homes to the Camp Fire inferno.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thousands-of-northern-california-fire-survivors-take-refuge-in-tent-cities_us_5bf495e6e4b0771fb6b3b1f3", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf497be260000cf03847d4c.jpeg?cache=scx8zxuog6&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T23:26:50Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "Tap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "HuffPost Video", "title": "Millie Bobby Brown Becomes UNICEF\u2019s Youngest Goodwill Ambassador", "description": "In addition to starring on \u201cStranger Things,\u201d Millie Bobby Brown is now a UNICEF goodwill ambassador.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stranger-things-star-millie-bobby-brown-is-a-unicef-goodwill-ambassador_us_5bf496eee4b02454d6032f96", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf496ee24000039045836e6.jpeg?cache=GTD922zyXp&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T23:19:50Z", "content": "Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.

And because marijuana remains a Schedule I substance under federal law, the U.S. government maintains there is no way to use cannabis lawfully.\n\nIn 2016, a federal appeals court ruled that this prohibition did not violate the Second Amendment rights of a Nevada medical marijuana patient who was turned down by a gun store after trying to buy a firearm in 2011.\n\nRoman\u2019s suit, filed last week, alleges that federal law violates his Second Amendment right to gun ownership and his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination (because federal firearm transaction forms require medical marijuana patients to report that they use the drug \u201cunlawfully,\u201d even when it\u2019s sanctioned under state law). The complaint specifically names acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker and the directors of the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, where the suit was filed, declined to comment on the case.\n\nYou have alcoholics who are not prohibited from owning firearms. John Weston, attorney for plaintiff Matthew Roman\n\nAttorneys for Roman say the restriction on gun ownership for medical marijuana patients is in part the result of decades of \u201ccannabis propaganda,\u201d which they argue has led to inaccurate claims about the herb being associated with violent behavior.\n\nThe federal government is \u201cadvancing an interpretation of the law which automatically assumes that medical marijuana patients, by operation of the method of treatment for their illnesses, are prone to engage in gun violence in the same manner as those adjudicated mentally ill or those who have been convicted of a felony,\u201d the complaint alleges. Ex-offenders and individuals who have been adjudicated as mentally \u201cdefective\u201d or committed to a mental institution are also legally barred from gun ownership.\n\nThe complaint goes on to note that federal law treats marijuana differently than it does other approved treatments for PTSD, such as Ambien, as well as legal recreational drugs like alcohol \u2015 both of which are known to carry more substantial risks than cannabis.\n\n\u201cYou have alcoholics who are not prohibited from owning firearms,\u201d attorney John Weston told HuffPost. \u201cAmbien has side effects that are arguably much worse than those of medical marijuana, and yet a person who\u2019s being prescribed Ambien for this same condition has the absolute constitutional right to own a firearm for self-defense in his home.\u201d\n\nThe question, Weston said, is why the federal government is \u201cpicking on medical marijuana ... when it\u2019s much less harmful than any of the other medicines you can use to treat this condition.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Photographs of marijuana plants on the wall of a Pennsylvania medical marijuana dispensary. A Philadelphia-based doctor and cannabis patient is challenging a federal law that bars legal medical marijuana users from gun ownership.\n\nThe strict nature of Pennsylvania\u2019s medical marijuana law, which carefully controls the drug \u201cfrom seed to consumer,\u201d should be enough to tamp down the government\u2019s concerns about the plant\u2019s potential nexus to crime, Weston added.\n\nIn light of that, he expressed confidence that Roman\u2019s suit would have a better chance than the previous 2016 ruling, issued by 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. Victory could take a number of different forms, said Weston, ranging from a narrow ruling affecting only Roman to one that could more broadly upend federal firearms restrictions on medical marijuana patients.\n\nFor cannabis advocates, a change to rules about medical marijuana and gun ownership is long overdue.\n\n\u201cThere is no credible justification for a \u2018marijuana exception\u2019 to the U.S. Constitution,\u201d Paul Armentano, deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said in a statement to HuffPost. \u201cResponsible adults who use cannabis in a manner that is compliant with the laws of their states ought to receive the same legal rights and protections as do other citizens.\u201d\n\nArmentano went on to urge Congress to pass legislation to federally decriminalize marijuana \u201cin a way that comports with both public and scientific opinion, as well as its rapidly changing legal status under state laws.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Brittany Nims", "title": "Cyber Monday Deals On Nintendo Switch Bundles, Games And Accessories - HuffPost", "description": "HuffPost Cyber Monday Deals On Nintendo Switch Bundles, Games And Accessories HuffPost The hunt is on for some of Black Friday and Cyber Monday's best gaming deals, and that includes sales on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One X, Xbox One S and, of course, the Ninte\u2026", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/where-to-get-a-nintendo-switch-cheap-on-black-friday-cyber-monday_us_5bf46f2ce4b0eb6d93091502", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b4ccac119000027004fb9d6.jpeg?ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T22:27:00Z", "content": "The hunt is on for some of Black Friday and Cyber Monday \u2019s best gaming deals, and that includes sales on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One X, Xbox One S and, of course, the Nintendo Switch.

Khashoggi is believed to have been killed soon after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. His body was then dismembered and disposed of.\n\nIn his statement Tuesday, Ryan called on Congress to take action against Saudi Arabia despite Trump\u2019s reluctance to take any further punitive steps against the kingdom.\n\n\u201cIn this failure of leadership from President Trump, it now falls to Congress to stand up for America\u2019s true values and lasting interests,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe Senate is expected to take up a bill next week from Sens.

Park, a DACA recipient from the Flushing neighborhood of New York City, told HuffPost that it took some time for the achievement to sink in.\n\n\u201cI felt still \u2015 just an incredibly still silence. I felt neither happy nor sad. I think I didn\u2019t actually register that I had won this thing until a few hours after and everything had calmed down and I began to settle into my emotions,\u201d he said. \u201cThen the stillness gave way to a wave of gratitude, thankfulness and love for my parents, my community, the city of New York and my country.\u201d\n\nThe molecular and cellular biology major boasts a resume that\u2019s nothing short of remarkable. In addition to his responsibilities as a student, he juggles volunteering for his nonprofit organization Higher Dreams, which provides resources to undocumented students looking to go to college, and the Harvard Phillips Brooks House Association Chinatown Citizenship program, which offers naturalization assistance in Boston.\n\nAnd as if that weren\u2019t enough, he serves as the managing editor of The Harvard Undergraduate Research Journal as well as a research assistant at the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT. He\u2019s also a chapter leader of Define American, a nonprofit media and culture organization that aims to challenge the media\u2019s depiction of immigrants.\n\nWhile Park\u2019s professional aspirations lie in the medical field, so much of his extracurricular work around immigration draws from his life experience. He moved with his family from South Korea to the U.S. when he was 7 years old. His father took up jobs in Korean restaurants, and his mother worked in nail salons.\n\n\u201cSo if you\u2019ve ever eaten at a Korean restaurant or received a mani-pedi in New York City, congratulations. Like it or not, you may have partially subsidized the education of what Fox News would call an illegal alien,\u201d Park quipped during a speech in front of Harvard\u2019s class of 2018.\n\nHis status affected his navigation of society, and he wasn\u2019t always so open about his immigrant background. He revealed to HuffPost that growing up, he was instructed to avoid \u201cfooling around next to police or other law enforcement\u201d and to never disclose where he\u2019s from so as to not invite discussion of his immigration status.\n\nToday, Park is an outspoken advocate for the undocumented community, and he said he feels that the mainstream media is due for a much more nuanced, complex discussion around immigration. The topic is often cast as a Latinx issue, yet Asian-Americans are the fastest growing immigrant population in the U.S., and he pointed out that the term \u201cundocumented immigrant\u201d doesn\u2019t often conjure images of Korean-Americans like him. Yet the experiences of the unauthorized population shouldn\u2019t be boiled down to just race or ethnicity, he said.\n\n\u201cImmigration in America has always been racialized. Latinx folks are disproportionately affected by immigration enforcement, but I think being undocumented as a social condition affects all undocumented immigrants in some very common, intersectional ways,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is always that fear and feeling of not really being able to tell our full story or living in our truth. I think it\u2019s important to complicate prevailing narratives regarding undocumented immigrants.\u201d\n\nHe added that telling authentic stories of the undocumented population is particularly crucial \u201cat a time when the president of the United States is weaponizing immigrant narratives for an incredibly harmful agenda.\u201d\n\nWith the scholarship, Park has an education at Oxford University in England to look forward to after graduation. He has some solid advice for other undocumented students who may be having a difficult time under the current administration: Never forget your roots.\n\n\u201cKeep going. And understand that your story is beautiful and powerful,\u201d he said. \u201dWhen things become difficult, think of your community \u2015 your family, friends, mentors and partners.\u201d\n\nHe said that visits to his father in the restaurants where he worked always kept him grounded."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Cole Delbyck", "title": "\u2018Harry Potter\u2019 Cast Sends Evanna Lynch Love For \u2018Dancing With The Stars\u2019 Finale", "description": "Emma Watson, J.K.

It just recently started getting attention online.\n\nThe site spoke to an anonymous couple who use the pseudonyms Kate and Tom and live in the suburbs of a city in the northeastern United States. The two, who are both in their 40s, are both highly educated but have not paid off their students loans. They make a combined income of about $160,000 a year. Tom also bartends on the side for extra cash. They have three children who will all attend private school next year, bought a $360,000 house in 2007 and have about 15 credits cards, according to Kate. Tom said they have 10 or 11 credit cards \u2014 eight of which are maxed out.\n\nThey are also drowning in debt.\n\nKate told the website that the family shops at Goodwill, that they don\u2019t \u201chave fancy things in our house at all\u201d and grow vegetables that they eat in their yard. Yet despite growing some of their own produce, Kate admits the family drops a whole lot of money on food \u2014 especially vegan items and organic produce.\n\n\u201cOn a Friday night, we\u2019ll go to Whole Foods, and my son Luke will get a $15 thing of sushi and a smoothie. It\u2019s kind of crazy that we haven\u2019t reeled this in,\u201d Kate admitted.\n\nOther shocking confessions include buying their son a tuxedo for prom instead of renting one \u201cbecause we didn\u2019t have the cash\u201d \u2015 but did have a Nordstrom card to put the suit on; borrowing $40,000 from Kate\u2019s parents, who make less money than they do; and cashing out Tom\u2019s 401(k) to pay off some of the debt.\n\nThe wad of money they got from the 401(k) helped, but they were eventually taxed on it. The $40,000 they got from Kate\u2019s folks also made a dent, \u201cBut then we did it all over again,\u201d Tom admitted.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re in exactly the same place now. That\u2019s what bothers me the most.\u201d\n\nThe situation has left Kate depressed, she says. Throughout the piece, she begs Tom to file for bankruptcy, but he won\u2019t. She says things have gotten really hard and, crying, discloses that she contemplates divorce \u201cso I can help myself,\u201d but also says she\u2019s doesn\u2019t think the couple can afford to get one.\n\n\u201cFrankly, what I imagine is one of us will die from stress, and the life insurance will pay things off,\u201d Kate said.\n\nThe candid piece got mixed reactions on Twitter:\n\nA scary reality I\u2019m sure for many.

He plays Ed Reiss, the on-again, off-again lover of sharp-tongued drag performer Arnold Beckoff (Urie). When the first of the show\u2019s three acts begins in 1974, Ed is a closeted schoolteacher who frequents Manhattan gay bars and is aloof to all forms of intimacy. By the last of the three acts, set in 1980, the character has opened himself up to forming a chosen family with a same-sex partner.\n\nGrowing up in North Carolina, Horton had dreamed of performing in theater. He\u2019d cast his thespian dreams aside for a bit, taking a job in finance after college, but then returned to acting in 2001. He\u2019d been primarily focused on film, with roles in \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d and \u201cAnnabelle,\u201d among other movies.\n\nStill, he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the \u201cTorch Song\u201d script, which he received before auditioning for the 2017 off-Broadway production of the show. \u201cHonestly, it came out of nowhere. It wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d read when I was younger,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when they sent it to me, I was fascinated by it [and] I knew it was going to be amazing.\u201d\n\nHorton spoke to HuffPost about why the acclaimed show\u2019s queer-inclusive themes \u2015 ahead of their time in 1982 \u2015 still resonate 36 years later.\n\nWhat challenged you the most about the story?\n\nI think, for me, the hardest part was making sure I placed myself in that time period. I struggled a little bit with, \u201cWhy does Arnold love Ed the way he does?\u201d Because in 2018, Ed is not lovable. His conflict is so strong and his indecision is so apparent that someone like Arnold wouldn\u2019t give Ed the time of day in 2018.\n\nWhat resonated most with you about the role of Ed?\n\nHis being unabashedly honest, all the time, to a fault. No matter how conflicted he is, no matter how frustrated his view of the world is or his relationship with Arnold is, he\u2019s always honest. And I think Arnold knows he\u2019s always going to get honesty from him.\n\nMatthew Murphy \"No matter how conflicted he is, no matter how frustrated his view of the world is or his relationship with Arnold is, he\u2019s always honest,\" Horton (left, with co-star Michael Urie) said of his \"Torch Song\" character, Ed.\n\nEd starts off focused on hiding his sexuality, but by the play\u2019s end, he learns to embrace his authentic self. How did you find your way into that mindset?\n\nI needed to understand what it was like to be a closeted gay man during that time period. I read books on Stonewall. I interviewed a friend of mine who is about 55 years old, had a wife and kids and at around 35 or 40, realized he was living a lie. He\u2019s an openly gay man now. Also, I\u2019m working with a predominately gay cast. I learned, I listened, I absorbed and I loved.\n\nArnold may be the protagonist of \u201cTorch Song,\u201d but it\u2019s Ed who undergoes the biggest transformation by the end of the show.\n\nOne of the things that attracted me to the role is the journey Ed takes. He starts off saying a lot of things that in 2018 seem pretty ignorant and, in some ways, cruel. I\u2019d come off stage some nights and just be wrecked because the audience hated him, and I understood why. I understood how difficult it could be to watch someone resist something that we know that they want. But I found that, by the second act, if I could allow myself to really open up to the situation, this family and who Arnold is \u2015 because he\u2019s an amazing human being and someone I want to be with \u2015 I could get back on the audience\u2019s side a little bit.\n\nAndrew Eccles \"It\u2019s important to tell stories like this. Challenge norms. And, you know, keep people thinking,\" Horton (second from left) said of \"Torch Song.\"\n\nWhat\u2019s the best advice Harvey Fierstein gave to you?\n\nHe said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t go home completely embarrassed, you\u2019re not doing it right.\u201d\n\nWhat does it mean to you to be presenting this show at such a politically charged time in the world?\n\nIt\u2019s really exciting and I\u2019m proud to be a part of it. It\u2019s important to tell stories like this. Challenge norms. And, you know, keep people thinking. One of the great things about our play is that it touches everybody. People walk away from our play and think, \u201cI\u2019m not alone.\u201d Everybody has a family \u2015 good, bad, whatever it is. We all have mothers of some sort, right?\n\nWe need to make sure we\u2019re not allowing certain voices to push us down \u2013 push our communities down. Keep our foot on the pedal and make sure we continue the momentum we have. \"Torch Song\" star Ward Horton\n\nWhat do you think \u201cTorch Song\u201d has to say to a modern audience?\n\nI think it says we\u2019ve come a long way, but reminds us how easily we could slip back into particular ways of thinking. The reactions are different than they were 35, 40 years ago. Harvey was able to put something on stage and imagine what the future could be. People went to the theater and they saw the future. They saw a family, a gay man who adopts a gay son and [together] they live life like a traditional family. And now it doesn\u2019t seem so crazy, does it?\n\nI think that\u2019s the importance of a play like this. It feels like, in the past couple of years, we\u2019ve taken a step back, and I think that shows we need to fight harder. We need to make sure we\u2019re not allowing certain voices to push us down \u2015 push our communities down. Keep our foot on the pedal and make sure we continue the momentum we have.\n\nWhat would you say to an audience member who told you that he or she didn\u2019t support marriage equality and other LGBTQ rights?\n\nI would give them a hug. I would hug them and thank them. Because for someone with opposing views to come to our play, it shows they\u2019re making an effort. I feel like that\u2019s what we need right now. And, after watching our play and having the views they have, they would definitely need a hug!"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Sara Boboltz", "title": "House To Investigate Ivanka Trump\u2019s Use Of Personal Email For Official Business", "description": "Rep.

By the next morning, she had found images of the burned-out home in the town of Paradise where her 79-year-old mother, Vivian Fahlgren, lived with her two cats, Darla and Corby.\n\nMorris, who lives almost 3,000 miles away in Audubon, Pennsylvania, spent the morning calling shelters and law enforcement offices near Paradise, trying to find out if her mom was OK. Her mother had never had a cellphone and stayed relatively isolated from her neighbors. Morris couldn\u2019t get through to anyone who had seen her or heard of her whereabouts.\n\nFinally, after hours of calls, Morris saw that her mom had been accounted for on the Red Cross website, but she had no idea where she was or how to find her. The Red Cross told her three separate times that her mother had been moved to the \u201curgent list\u201d of people to find, but still, no one could give her any information.\n\nThen, on Saturday, more than a week after the fire wiped out Paradise and its surrounding towns, Morris\u2019 aunt Dianne saw a HuffPost story about the evacuees displaced by the wildfire.\n\nOne of those evacuees was Fahlgren \u2015 with Darla and Corby in tow.\n\nMorris contacted HuffPost via email. \u201cLooking for my mother, Vivian Fahlgren, fire victim,\u201d the email subject line read.

Because Penchansky gets her health care coverage through the military, she had to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket to have the procedure.\n\nRose Penchansky was on the fence about whether to say something.\n\nShe was on her computer, scrolling through a closed Facebook fan group for the Hulu show \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d shortly after the midterm elections and came across a post about the news that Alabama\u2019s voters had just passed an amendment giving \u201cunborn children\u201d the \u201cright to life in all manners and measures appropriate and lawful.\u201d It reiterated the fact that the state doesn\u2019t protect abortion rights or fund the procedure \u2015 something that could set the stage for abortion to become illegal in Alabama if Roe v. Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court.\n\nPenchansky, 33, watched members of the group debate about which abortions should be legal and which shouldn\u2019t. But after reading one too many strident posts about how abortions should be illegal or illegal after the first trimester, she knew she had to speak up about her second-trimester abortion, scheduled for just a few days later.\n\n\u201cThey did an in-depth ultrasound and discovered the baby had hydrops fetalis, pleural effusions, edema and cystic hygroma, and increased risk of Down\u2019s Syndrome and Turner\u2019s Syndrome,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey did emergency amniocentesis. All of that was the easy part.\u201d\n\n\u201cI decided to terminate, my husband agreed,\u201d she continued. This is where it became difficult.\u201d\n\nPenchansky lives in Tennessee, and if she had had health insurance through her employer, she likely would have had coverage for the abortion. But because her husband is in the military, she instead gets her health care through Tricare Prime, the military\u2019s health management organization for family members of military personnel.\n\nAnd because of a federal law that bans the use of federal funds for abortions for fetal anomalies, the second-trimester termination would cost $6,000 to $10,000 out of pocket \u2015 something her family couldn\u2019t afford.\n\n\u201cWhen the government starts taking a woman\u2019s right away and dictating how they can use their body, so begins the slippery slope into Gilead,\u201d Penchansky wrote, referring to the name of the \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d society that enslaves fertile women. \u201cThis is happening to me right now.\u201d\n\nA federal ban on abortion funding affects millions of Americans\n\nThe federal government has banned the use of federal funds for abortions since 1976, under what is known as the Hyde Amendment. It blocks states from using federal funds from Medicaid, Medicare or Children\u2019s Health Insurance programs to pay for abortions except in two instances: when a woman\u2019s life is in danger and when the pregnancy results from rape or incest.\n\nThis amendment has been used as the basis for more laws that prevent federal funding for abortion, said the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights advocacy organization. This includes laws that prevent the military from paying for abortions for fetal anomalies and extend to anyone employed by the federal government, anyone who gets health care through Veterans Affairs or the Indian Health Service and people in federal prisons or immigration detention centers.\n\nThese abortion restrictions affect millions of lives, Guttmacher notes. Tricare covers more than 9 million military members and their dependents, and the Federal Employee Health Benefits program for civilian federal employees covers more than 8 million people and their dependents.\n\nBecause Penchansky was young and healthy and had a previous uncomplicated pregnancy and birth, she didn\u2019t qualify for first-trimester screening tests covered by Tricare. It wasn\u2019t until she was 17 weeks along in her pregnancy that she received the results of her first fetal screening of any kind: the quad screen, a blood test that can detect signs of chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus, as well as some conditions in which the brain and spinal column don\u2019t develop properly.\n\nThe results weren\u2019t good. It showed that her baby had an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities and that she needed to see a specialist right away. But there was added urgency for her. Because she got her health care through the military, which doesn\u2019t cover abortions for fetal abnormality, the longer she waited, the more expensive a termination would be.\n\nShe moved as fast as she could. A week later, an in-depth ultrasound with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist revealed that half her baby girl\u2019s heart hadn\u2019t developed, she had a large fluid-filled cyst running from her head all the way down her spine and there were large accumulations of fluid in the chest cavity affecting both lungs.\n\n\u201cI pretty much had a mental breakdown in the office,\u201d Penchansky told HuffPost. \u201cMy son was with me, and I was really losing it.\u201d\n\nStill, she held on to hope for her daughter that the amniocentesis, a test that can diagnose abnormalities or birth defects, would have promising news.\n\n\u201cI told [the doctor] I wouldn\u2019t terminate unless I knew what was wrong with the baby,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to just base it off of an ultrasound.\u201d\n\nThe results came back at week 20. Her baby was diagnosed with Turner syndrome, which the doctor had suspected because of the large spinal cysts and accumulation of fluid in her body. The chromosomal disorder, in which a female fetus has only one X chromosome instead of two, results in miscarriage 99 percent of the time.\n\nThe doctor talked to Penchansky about the \u201clethal nature\u201d of the combination of the baby\u2019s Turner syndrome, half-formed heart and growing cysts, according to a medical record of the appointment.\n\nShe decided to end the pregnancy as soon as possible rather than prolong the baby\u2019s suffering or expose herself to the risk of delivering of a full-term baby with extremely large cystic growths.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to bring a baby into the world that has a 1 percent chance of making it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m either going to watch her pass away early on, or she\u2019s going to suffer.\u201d\n\nAn abortion that far along is an anomaly in the U.S. Only about 1.3 percent of abortions performed in this country happen after 21 weeks gestation.\n\nHow abortion restrictions make a tragic situation stressful\n\nThe federal restrictions on abortions for fetal anomalies, in combination with state laws that continue to close abortion clinics or make the window of legal abortion smaller, mean more pressure on women and their families in what are already difficult circumstances.\n\nDr. Neil Silverman, a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles, wasn\u2019t involved in Penchansky\u2019s case but reviewed her anonymized medical records.\n\nHe said that women like her are dealt a severe blow when they receive news about fatal fetal anomalies and that the situation is made worse by the \u201cexternal forces\u201d like gestational age cutoffs for abortions, restrictions on medical counseling and waiting periods for abortion that encroach on discussions between patients and doctors.\n\n\u201cI feel strongly that what I might do personally is not what any given woman or family might do, and counseling needs to be able to take all options into consideration, not just pregnancy termination,\u201d said Silverman, who specializes in high-risk pregnancies. \u201cThat said, termination can\u2019t be limited by external forces from the critical patient-physician discussion.\u201d\n\nPenchansky agreed. She said the lack of health insurance coverage for the procedure turned an already trying and difficult period of life for her into something stressful and expensive too.\n\nAfter deciding to terminate, she listened to her baby\u2019s heartbeat with a Doppler fetal monitor every day, but now with the hope that the baby inside her would die before her scheduled abortion.\n\n\u201cIf I can\u2019t find a heartbeat, I can go down to labor and delivery on the Army base,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey can check, confirm, and then [I] wind up with the dilation and evacuation on the Army base \u2015 and Tricare will pay for it.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t end up happening.\n\nInstead, she went through with the abortion \u2015 an induced birth, because she was so far along and the baby\u2019s heart was still beating \u2015 on Nov 15. But by the time she gave birth, the baby no longer had a heartbeat.\n\n\u201cMy body thinks I have a baby to feed, my belly is still swollen, and I have typical bleeding,\u201d wrote Penchansky in an email to HuffPost a few days after the procedure. \u201cI have moments where I keep busy and don\u2019t think about it, and moments where something triggers me and I break down.\u201d\n\nBut in addition to grieving the loss of their very much wanted baby girl, she keeps ruminating on the cost of the abortion.\n\nPenchansky said she believes that if she could have had a screening test like a nuchal translucency scan in the first trimester, the problems would have been caught sooner \u2015 and she could have easily afforded a $1,000 first trimester abortion at a local Planned Parenthood. In the end, her parents ended up lending her $10,000 for the second-trimester abortion.\n\nSilverman said that it was difficult to say at this point whether the baby\u2019s issues would have been visible in a first-trimester ultrasound but that it was possible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very likely that with a large fluid collection like a cystic hygroma seen in the second trimester, that the nuchal translucency typically measured on ultrasound in the first trimester as a screening test might have been enlarged as well,\u201d he said. This would have then triggered more diagnostic testing like chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis earlier, which would have found the Turner syndrome faster.\n\nKevin Dwyer, a spokesman for Tricare, didn\u2019t comment directly on Penchansky\u2019s case but said that the health plan complies with federal laws banning abortion except when the mother\u2019s life is in danger or the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.\n\nHe also said that Tricare\u2019s schedule for ultrasounds and other prenatal care is in line with guidelines published by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which recommends a first-trimester ultrasound only if the mother has certain symptoms or risk factors.\n\nLike many other military family members during deployment, Penchansky went through all this without her spouse by her side. He is stationed in Texas and didn\u2019t go home for the termination.\n\nThey decided that together, she explained, because it took him one year to qualify for the specialized military training that he\u2019s doing now. Instead, her sister and brother-in-law went to be with her and care for her 5-year-old son while she was in the hospital.\n\nHer boy is old enough to know she was pregnant but too young to understand why the pregnancy ended without a baby sibling for him. In the weeks leading up to the induction, Penchansky tried explaining to him several times that the baby in her belly was very sick and that she needed to go to the hospital to take the baby out.\n\n\u201cI asked him if he understands, and he says \u2018yes,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut then he tells his speech therapist that we\u2019re having a girl.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Antonia Blumberg", "title": "Mississippi GOP Senator Posted A Photo Of Herself Wearing Confederate Hat", "description": "Sen.

But before you embark on a home-cooked Thanksgiving meal, there\u2019s one very important thing you need to do: Make a recycling plan.\n\nPeople often recycle incorrectly or fail to recycle at all, said Rebecca Benner, the director of science and strategy at The Nature Conservancy in New York. And Thanksgiving certainly presents the opportunity to create a lot of waste.\n\n\u201cThe consequence of not recycling is that your waste ends up in landfills and produces toxic gases that harm the planet and lead to more climate change, which in turn has huge numbers of consequences,\u201d said Benner. \u201cIt\u2019s also really important to check with your local agency to see what they do and don\u2019t recycle because you can contaminate an entire batch of recycling if you stick something in there that can\u2019t be recycled.\u201d\n\nLook Up Your Community Guidelines\n\nBefore Thursday, look up your community\u2019s recycling information. Not every municipality accepts the same recyclables, so it\u2019s important to learn which items are accepted in your area. You can also find options for responsibly disposing of less common types of materials, though they may require driving to a specific location or coordinating a pickup.\n\nSome things to keep in mind around Thanksgiving include the importance of scrubbing food grease off aluminum pans and tins, removing wood or plastic accents on otherwise recyclable items and repurposing things that can\u2019t be recycled like stained napkins and tablecloths. If after consulting online resources, you\u2019re still not sure about what you can and cannot recycle, try calling your local recycling service ahead of Thanksgiving Day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to do recycling the wrong way than it is to do it the right way,\u201d Benner said, noting that recycling companies often change the rules around what is and isn\u2019t accepted and don\u2019t always communicate these changes very well. \u201cSometimes, it just takes a lot of conscientious research or contacting your local recycling company to make sure that you\u2019re actually putting in the things that they take.\u201d\n\nMaren Caruso via Getty Images There are many steps you can take toward having a sustainable Thanksgiving.\n\nOf course, you can take further steps toward having a sustainable Thanksgiving. \u201cObviously the best thing you could do is minimize the number of things you even need to recycle because recycling still takes energy,\u201d said Benner.\n\nBeyond Recycling\n\nOne positive step is using real plates, cutlery, cookware and serving platters. Investing in a large roasting pan that you don\u2019t have to throw away is a great way to save yourself from having to buy new disposable ones, especially if you think you might host Thanksgiving again in the future or want to roast a chicken at some point during the year.\n\n\u201cAs a working mom who has lots of people over for Thanksgiving, the idea of washing my dishes is sometimes more than I can handle, but I always try to use reusable dishes,\u201d Benner noted. \u201cAnd if you have a dishwasher, even better because that actually saves on water as opposed to hand-washing the dishes.\u201d\n\nIf you do end up using disposable aluminum pans, you can wash them and try to reuse them again or even convert them to foil covers for leftovers (while following health guidelines of course).\n\nIf you can\u2019t go with reusable dishes, Benner recommends compostable forks, knives, plates or cups rather than the single-use plastic options.\n\n\u201cPlastics end up in our oceans, they end up in animals, and they kill off water systems. It\u2019s great that we\u2019re capable of recycling some plastics because at least we can do something with the stuff that can\u2019t break down,\u201d said Benner. \u201cBut it\u2019s still very energy-intensive. So in my house, everything is at least semi-compostable, and there\u2019s a plethora of options out there now that are more sustainable in nature so they break down more readily.\u201d\n\nThe Food Waste Issue\n\nAnother way to be more eco-conscious around the holiday is to calculate your Thanksgiving travel carbon footprint and offset it by contributing to a program like Carbon Fund or Terrapass. And then of course, there\u2019s the food waste component.\n\nBenner also recommends being realistic about how much food your guests actually will need, cooking with local, organic ingredients whenever possible, minimizing meat (and going free-range with your turkey), turning your cooking scraps into soups or other easy dishes you can freeze, and of course, embracing the leftovers game.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that we waste 30 to 40 percent of the overall food supply \u2015 that\u2019s about 133 billion pounds of food a year and that\u2019s the singular biggest source of waste to our landfills which produce tons of methane, which is a major factor in climate change,\u201d said Benner. \u201cSo if we can lower food waste, eat our leftovers, make the portion sizes more reasonable for the number of people coming, we can do a huge amount toward having a more sustainable Thanksgiving.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Cole Delbyck", "title": "Ariana Grande\u2019s \u2018Thank U, Next\u2019 Music Video Is Inspired By Iconic 2000s Rom-Coms", "description": "\"Mean Girls, \"13 Going on 30\" and \"Legally Blonde\" all get a shoutout.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ariana-grandes-thank-u-next-music-video-is-inspired-by-iconic-2000s-rom-coms_us_5bf443dee4b0c097a8e0797f", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf447a42400006d0499ba32.png?cache=JJgSnfO0Rf&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T19:23:18Z", "content": "Our most pop-culturally literate pop star Ariana Grande has apparently turned the forthcoming music video for her smash single \u201cThank U, Next\u201d into a master class for iconic 2000s romantic comedies.

But Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea has stressed that the list is raw data and does not necessarily paint an accurate picture of who is missing.\n\nTo describe the task of getting a precise count as \u201cdifficult\u201d would be a wild understatement, Honea told HuffPost.\n\nCayce Clifford for HuffPost Cal Fire and police teams transfer the remains of a fire victim, who was found in a Paradise, California, residence, into a hearse on Nov. 16, 2018.\n\n\u201cIt would seem that it would be very simple \u2015 just call in and give us the names,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cBut given how chaotic this situation has been, the magnitude of the situation, the number of people that we\u2019ve had to evacuate \u2014 it\u2019s nowhere near as simple a task as one might think it is at first blush.\u201d\n\nThe weekend\u2019s dramatic increase in the still-missing count came after officials went back through the massive volume of emails and 911 calls that poured in during and after the inferno swept through Paradise and the surrounding area. In the early stages of the fire, overwhelmed dispatchers simply took down the caller\u2019s name, the caller\u2019s contact information and whom a caller was looking for. The sheriff\u2019s office has since ramped up its resources and combed through those communications, compiling a master list of every person flagged as unaccounted for.\n\nThe list is constantly changing. It has included duplicate names and even people who died years earlier. Those who called to report someone as missing don\u2019t always call back when they\u2019ve located that individual. In \u201cmany, many cases,\u201d Honea said, people on the list have turned out to be safe, completely unaware that someone was worried about them.\n\n\u201cThat, I think, owes to the fact that the normal course of how people stay connected with their circle of friends and family has been disrupted,\u201d Honea said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been evacuated. Their text messaging, cell phones, landline phones, email, all of that has been disrupted.\u201d\n\nCayce Clifford for HuffPost A member of the Tuolumne Sheriff Search & Rescue team searches for human remains at a home in Paradise.\n\nThe character of the community in Paradise and surrounding towns like Magalia and Pulga has made this search particularly challenging. Many residents chose to settle down in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas for the isolation. Some of them are notoriously private; many wanted to live off the grid. They include a lot of lower-income retirees. As a result, a significant number of residents lack cell phones, as well as family and friends in the area whom they might get in touch with after they\u2019ve evacuated.\n\nHonea reasoned that it would be best to put every possible name on a list, push it out to the public and work through it by asking the community for help locating people. The alternative would have been to tackle it internally.\n\n\u201cMy thought process was progress over perfection,\u201d Honea said. \u201cThe list will fluctuate up and down. As we get more data pushed into it, you\u2019ll get more information.\u201d\n\nSome 5,000 firefighters continue to battle the Camp fire, which as of Tuesday morning was 70 percent contained. Since Saturday, Butte County officials have also managed to confirm the whereabouts of hundreds of people who were previously unaccounted for. As of Sunday evening, just shy of 1,000 people were on the list, down nearly 300 from one day earlier. And by Monday evening, the count of the missing stood at 699.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll feel good again,\u201d Honea said Monday evening. \u201cBut I\u2019m encouraged by the drop. \u2026 I\u2019m optimistic about the process that we have going and I feel like we are getting our arms around it.\u201d\n\nMembers of the sheriff\u2019s search and rescue team, as well as volunteers, continue going from property to property, using tools and cadaver-sniffing dogs to search for human remains. The death toll from the Camp fire rose to 79 on Monday, after officials discovered the remains of two more people.\n\nThe fire has scorched more than 150,000 acres and destroyed nearly 17,000 structures, including 12,637 residences.\n\nCayce Clifford for HuffPost Eris, a member of the Butte County Sheriff's Search & Rescue K9 unit, walks with handlers through a devastated home in Paradise, searching for remains.\n\nThe Camp fire is by far the most destructive wildfire in California\u2019s history, topping the 2017 Tubbs fire, which torched some 5,600 structures and killed 22 people. Fourteen of the state\u2019s 20 most-destructive fires on record have occurred since 2003.\n\nAdditionally, 15 of the state\u2019s 20 largest fires on record have occurred since 2002. The Mendocino Complex fire, which burned more than 450,000 acres north of Santa Rosa in July, surpassed last year\u2019s Thomas fire as the largest wildfire in California\u2019s history.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke have both traveled to California to see the destruction from the Camp fire. Trump has blamed the state\u2019s wildfires on everything from a lack of raking to a nonexistent shortage of water to fight fires to \u201cbad environmental laws.\u201d\n\nDuring his visit last week, Zinke said, \u201cThis is not the time for finger pointing.\u201d He repeated that line in a Sunday interview with Breitbart News, only to turn around and blame \u201cradical environmentalists,\u201d as he often does, for the disaster.\n\n\u201cI will lay this on the foot of those environmental radicals that have prevented us from managing the forests for years,\u201d said Zinke. \u201cAnd you know what?

Then, this past October, The New York Times obtained a memo indicating that the administration was considering narrowly defining gender \u201cas a biological, immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth.\u201d Anyone wishing to challenge their officially-assigned sex would have to have the matter resolved by genetic testing.\n\nThose opposed to recognizing gender identity sometimes call it a form of \u201cradical gender ideology\u201d or \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d gone too far.\n\nBut recognition of transgender identity is no recent phenomenon: Some doctors acknowledged gender nonconforming people far earlier than most might realize. Perhaps the most important pioneer was German physician Magnus Hirschfeld, who was born 150 years ago, in 1868. As a historian of gender and sexuality in Germany, I\u2019m struck by how he paved the way for the legal recognition of gender nonconforming people.\n\nMagnus Hirschfeld, on the right, sits with his partner, Tao Li, at the fourth conference of the World League for Sexual Reform in 1932. Wellcome Images, CC BY\n\nHirschfeld\u2019s \u2018sexual intermediaries\u2019\n\nIn recent years, the medical and psychological professions have come to a consensus that sex assignment at birth is inadequate for understanding individuals\u2019 sexual and gender identity \u2013 and that failure to recognize this fact can have a devastating impact.\n\nMagnus Hirschfeld was the first doctor to openly research and advocate for people whose gender did not correspond with their sex assignment at birth.\n\nHe\u2019s often remembered today as an advocate of gay rights, and in the early 20th century, his activism played a major role in nearly overturning Germany\u2019s law criminalizing male same-sex relations.\n\nBut Hirschfeld\u2019s vision extended much further than homosexuality. He defined his specialty as \u201csexual intermediaries,\u201d which included everyone who did not fit into an \u201cideal type\u201d of heterosexual, cis-gendered men and women.\n\nAccording to Hirschfeld, sexual intermediaries included many categories. One type was cis-gendered people who were gay, lesbian or bisexual. Another consisted of transvestites: people who comfortably identified as their assigned sex but who preferred to dress in the clothing assigned to the other sex. Yet others were \u201ctrans\u201d in a more radical direction, like those who wanted to live fully as their non-assigned sex or longed for sex-change surgery.\n\nA relentless advocate\n\nAs a gay man, Hirschfeld was aware of the legal and social dangers sexual intermediaries faced.\n\nSince sexual intermediaries often turned to their doctors for help, Hirschfeld worked to educate the medical community. He published medical journals including the \u201cYearbook on Sexual Intermediaries\u201d and the \u201cJournal of Sexual Science.\u201d In 1919, he founded the Institute for Sexual Science in Berlin to promote further research.\n\nIn court he gave expert testimony on behalf of men who had been accused of violating Germany\u2019s law banning male same-sex relations.\n\nHe even co-wrote and made a cameo appearance in the world\u2019s first feature-length movie featuring a gay protagonist: the 1919 silent film \u201cAnders als die Anderen\u201d (\u201cDifferent from the Others\u201d).\n\nNor did Hirschfeld shy away from political engagement. In 1897, he founded the \u201cScientific Humanitarian Committee\u201d to advocate for gender and sexual rights.\n\nThen, from 1897 to 1898, Hirschfeld worked to decriminalize male same-sex relations in Germany. He collected over 5,000 signatures from Germans willing to be publicly identified with the effort, including such luminaries as Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann. A bill decriminalizing male homosexual acts gained only minority support when it was introduced in Parliament in 1898, but a new bill was reintroduced after the First World War. In the more progressive environment of the Weimar Republic, the bill advanced to parliamentary committee, only to stall when the Great Depression hit in 1929.\n\nImportantly, Hirschfeld\u2019s advocacy extended well beyond the decriminalization of gay male sex.\n\nLike most European countries, Germany had \u2013 and still has \u2013 an \u201cinternal passport,\u201d a government-issued ID that citizens are expected to carry with them. Germans whose passport indicated \u201cmale\u201d but who dressed in female clothing were subject to police harassment or arrest for disorderly conduct.\n\nTogether with a colleague, Hirschfeld in 1910 convinced the Berlin police to accept a \u201ctransvestite certificate,\u201d signed by a doctor, to nullify such charges. After World War I, he convinced the Prussian judiciary to permit legal name changes from gender-specific names to gender-neutral names, which enabled trans people to present as the gender that was most true to themselves.\n\nNot all sexual minorities in Germany endorsed Hirschfeld\u2019s views. Early twentieth-century Germany was a politically and culturally diverse place, and that diversity extended to same-sex and gender-nonconforming people.\n\nSome gay men, for example, argued that far from being an \u201cintermediary\u201d sexual type, they were the most masculine men of all: After all, they didn\u2019t form close bonds with women. The vision of these \u201cmasculinists\u201d had little room for lesbians, bisexuals, or trans people.\n\nA life\u2019s work goes up in flames\n\nBy contrast, Hirschfeld\u2019s approach was all-inclusive. In his view, all \u201csexual intermediaries\u201d \u2013 whether L, G, B, T, Q, or I in today\u2019s parlance \u2013 were worth recognizing and protecting. He once calculated that there were 43,046,721 possible variants of human sexuality. That was simply another way of saying that the human species was infinitely diverse.\n\n\u201cLove,\u201d he said, \u201cis as varied as people are.\u201d\n\nWhen the Nazis came to power in 1933, Hirschfeld, who was Jewish, was on tour lecturing on sexual science. From abroad, he watched newsreels of his Institute for Sexual Science set aflame by Nazi Storm Troopers. Thousands of unique medical records, publications, photos and artifacts were destroyed.\n\nStudents organized by the Nazi party parade in front of the building of the Institute for Sexual Research in Berlin prior to pillaging it on May 6, 1933. United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\n\nHirschfeld died two years later, and materials confiscated by the Nazis became evidence against gender and sexually-nonconforming people in the Third Reich. Male same-sex relations weren\u2019t decriminalized in East Germany until 1968, and in West Germany until 1969. Full legal equality had to wait even longer.\n\nNearly a century after Hirschfeld\u2019s institute burned, only tentative progress has been made in ending discrimination based on gender identity. And that progress is at risk.\n\nYet no bureaucratic definition of \u201csex\u201d will change what Hirschfeld so clearly demonstrated over 120 years ago: Trans people exist."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Hayley Miller", "title": "Trump: U.S. To Stand By Saudi Arabia Even If MBS Ordered Khashoggi Killing", "description": "\"It could very well be\" that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \"had knowledge of this tragic event,\" the president said.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-saudi-arabia-jamal-khashoggi-statement-mohammed-bin-salman_us_5bf4495fe4b0a7286a0e3d8b", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf1b1c124000060045835ea.jpeg?cache=tl4wwbti5o&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T17:59:46Z", "content": "The world is a very dangerous place!

Critics were vexed by her hefty appetite for violence and gore, which targeted women as much as men.\n\nIn one her more memorable strips, a cartoon version of Julie is drinking street beers with her pen pal when he chops off his penis and hands it to her like a bouquet of flowers. \u201cHum it\u2019s just like sausage,\u201d she says after chomping down on its meat. In another, Julie recounts a dream in which she masturbates with a cookie.

A dog eventually slurps up her insides.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t a woman like they wanted,\u201d Doucet told the crowd, the \u201cthey\u201d referring to the feminist community prominent at the beginning of her career.\n\nThirty years after her debut, however, she was surrounded by people who wanted her \u2015 by comic nerds in thick-framed glasses, tatted-up millennial women and a sprinkling of kids doodling in their seats. Over the years, she has become a legend in the niche community of underground comics, and the afternoon\u2019s gathering was proof.\n\nDrawn + Quarterly A strip from Doucet\u2019s series of semiautobiographical comics, \u201cDirty Plotte.\u201d\n\nThe crowd had gathered to celebrate the new book Dirty Plotte: The Complete Julie Doucet, a compilation of her drawings made from 1988 to 1998, accompanied by essays, interviews and testimonials from fans and friends. When Doucet finally addressed the crowd, the audience arched collectively forward, teetering on the edge of seats not only to get a closer look at the comic mastermind but also, more practically, to hear her. The artist who castrates, menstruates, self-mutilates and masturbates with reckless abandon on the page is incredibly shy in person.\n\nShe speaks in a honeyed whisper, her cheeks caught in a state of perpetual blushing. During her interview with critic Anne Elizabeth Moore, the author of the biography Sweet Little Cunt offered little more than big smiles and barely audible snippets of sentences. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about menstruation,\u201d Moore said, starting the talk off with one of Doucet\u2019s favorite subjects for drawings. \u201cWhat is there to say?\u201d she responded innocently.\n\nAt that moment, a projection of one of her comics, titled \u201cHeavy Flow,\u201d appeared on the wall over her head. Created in 1989, if features Julie squatting atop her bed as the stain between her legs starts to leak through her underwear onto the sheets. \u201cHo no fuck ... fuck,\u201d the cartoon exclaims, the figure tugging frantically on her hair and clutching her crotch in a futile attempt to catch errant dribbles.\n\nA few panels later, a supersized Julie is hulking through New York City like Godzilla riding the crimson wave. Snot and spit spew from every possible hole as black blood gushes like lava from her crotch. It is one of the most graphic, grotesque and accurate depictions of a gnarly period I\u2019ve ever seen. Below this triumphant vision of female monstrosity \u2015 a glorious middle finger to the woo-woo rhetoric of moon cycles and goddess flows \u2015 Doucet sat quietly, her smile communicating naivet\u00e9 more than mischief.\n\nDrawn + Quarterly Doucet\u2019s penchant for ugly truths and uglier fantasies, which once made her a pariah in feminist circles, is now considered a superhuman strength.\n\nBorn in 1965, Doucet grew up in an upper-middle-class suburb outside Montreal. A fearless tomboy who loved to draw, she said she felt more comfortable in the company of boys at the time than the crowds of her all-girls Catholic high school.\n\nShe began making comics as a college student at the University of Quebec at Montreal, quickly identifying bodily functions as her muse. Menstruating was \u201cinspirational,\u201d she said. It packs pure visual force in her panels, a splash of red across the otherwise mundane happenings of everyday life.\n\nDoucet didn\u2019t think anyone would ever see her work at first, so she amused herself by conjuring the wackiest, lewdest stories her imagination could muster. Totally uncensored, she recognized no limits or taboos. Her methods were \u201ccompulsive,\u201d she explained. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was communicating with other women. It was about myself.\u201d\n\nHer very first published comic was for a student anthology in 1986. In it, a character named Dulie Joucet strips down naked, hacks off her breasts and slices open her belly \u2015 a play on the artist showing her guts. Shortly after that, Doucet dropped out of school and went on welfare, determined to focus on making more comics and showing them to whoever was willing to look. In 1988 she drew the first edition of \u201cDirty Plotte,\u201d a stapled storm of fever dreams that ran every month in Factsheet Five, a sort of zine culture directory famous in the 1980s and early \u201990.\n\nAt the time, the underground comic scene was predominantly male, with an anything-goes attitude that elevated mostly heterosexual male fantasies. (Think: Robert Crumb, Jack Jackson.) But there was a small contingent of influential female voices, including Aline Kominsky-Crumb, who eventually noticed Doucet\u2019s work and asked her to contribute to the anthologies Wimmen\u2019s Comix and Weirdo. Like Doucet, Kominsky-Crumb is well known for recounting the most intimate, sordid and sometimes humiliating details of her life in images. Doucet might have initially considered herself deviant, but she was beginning to realize that other women sought to commit the same sorts of social violations she did.\n\nIn 1989 Doucet began publishing \u201cDirty Plotte\u201d with publisher Drawn + Quarterly (the company also responsible for her 2018 book), and the fan letters rolled in. Readers \u2015 women and men \u2015 thanked Doucet for vocalizing thoughts and experiences they\u2019d long kept silent, so she started publishing their testimonials alongside her work.\n\n\u201cI really love your comic books,\u201d wrote Jessica. \u201cSo much so, in fact, that I wanted to write you and tell you what my penis is named. Except, I don\u2019t have one (a penis).\u201d\n\n\u201cMy god this shit\u2019s disturbing,\u201d a fan named Rob wrote, \u201cbut then again, that\u2019s probably why I like it so much.\u201d\n\nDrawn + Quarterly Doucet demonstrates how one person\u2019s usually hidden vulnerability and vulgarity can be a beacon of support when experienced in the open.\n\nDoucet also invited readers to send her appropriately NSFW goodies: dick pics, photos of tattoos, images of themselves she could then maim and dismember on the page. An Australian fan named Robert sent a paper-doll-type drawing of himself in glasses and nothing else. A hatchet, saw and various knives floated around him. Dotted lines suggested the best places to operate. \u201cI never could draw hands and feet,\u201d he wrote. \u201c(cut em off.)\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, the fan letters got weird. \u201cI like your mag because you look like my sister,\u201d one reader said. Another begged her to castrate him before he masturbated on her drawings again.\n\nIt was the unfortunate nerd-bro tenor of the comic scene that led Doucet to quit comics in 2006. \u201cI was quite sick of the crowd, the all-men\u2019s crowd,\u201d she told Vulture this year. \u201cMen tend to be very obsessive about comics and not be interested in anything else but comics. That drove me crazy.\u201d Since, she has dabbled in other art forms, from collage to short film, but never returned to her signature medium. She would return to comics, she told me, only if she had something new to say.\n\nA lot has changed since she joined and then left the underground scene of the \u201980s and \u201990s. Her penchant for ugly truths and uglier fantasies, which once made her a pariah in feminist circles, is now considered a superhuman strength. Shameless in the best of ways, Doucet demonstrates how one person\u2019s vulnerability and vulgarity, more often confined to bedrooms and diaries than projected to crowds, can be a beacon of mutual support when experienced in the open. Even her introversion has a defiant streak, the perfect polar opposite of her spare-no-detail drawings. She always expresses precisely what she wants to \u2014 no more, no less.\n\nOf all the nasty shit Doucet has put on paper, there\u2019s only one comic she has ever regretted, she said. It\u2019s called \u201cMy First Time,\u201d from 1993, detailing the not-so-special way she lost her virginity to a scraggly, older artist. \u201cI guess this is it!\u201d 17-year-old Julie thinks as the man pumps into her until he comes.

It can be both exciting and scary to see your kids grow up, make their own decisions and build friendships. And if a bully enters the picture, it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what to do.\n\nHuffPost spoke to experts with backgrounds in anti-bullying initiatives about the signs many children display if they\u2019re being bullied at school, at extracurricular activities, online or elsewhere. These experts also shared helpful advice about what parents can do to resolve the situation.\n\nWhat are the signs of bullying?\n\nIt\u2019s important for parents to keep in mind that there\u2019s \u201cnothing that\u2019s an absolutely 100 percent tell\u201d that a child is being bullied, said Elizabeth Englander, founder and director of the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center at Bridgewater State University.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that suggests a child might be in distress is if they are having problems sleeping or having problems eating, and those kinds of problems happen with lots of different issues,\u201d she said.\n\nOf course, these sorts of symptoms are important for parents and caretakers to follow up on whether they\u2019re associated with bullying or not. Many of the signs of bullying our experts shared are rooted in one thing: change.\n\nIrene van der Zande, founder and executive director of Kidpower, a nonprofit focused on child safety, told HuffPost that kids who are being bullied often display a change in behavior. For example, they might be more fearful or aggressive.\n\n\u201cThat can be a symptom of bullying,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re acting out what is happening to them at school.\u201d\n\nIf school is where the bullying takes place, parents might find that their kid feels well during the weekend and sick during the week, van der Zande said. She also noted that if a child suddenly gets embarrassed about something that wouldn\u2019t normally trigger such feelings, it might be a reflection of \u201csome hurtful teasing\u201d the child is experiencing.\n\nParents should pay attention if they find that their child is now dismissing friends they used to hang out with or rejecting activities they used to enjoy, said Julie Hertzog, director of PACER\u2019s National Bullying Prevention Center. Changes in sleep patterns can not only be harmful for children, but also a sign of the child\u2019s distress, she added.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to be aware of the language kids might use.\n\n\u201cThey might not say, \u2018Someone is bullying me,\u2019\u201d Hertzog said. \u201cThey might use the word \u2018drama,\u2019 like, \u2018There\u2019s drama at school.\u2019 There might be that eye roll or they might say, \u2018Nobody likes me at school.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat about cyberbullying?\n\nCyberbullying is just one part of the general bullying landscape, but the anonymity that comes with online communication and the inexperience many adults have with kids\u2019 social media platforms mean it often earns extra attention in our technology-filled society. Since many kids, even those in elementary school, now have cell phones and other devices, it\u2019s even more difficult for the adults in their lives to access certain spaces in which the child might be facing disrespect or teasing.\n\n\u201cHistorically, before kids had a phone in their hand, [bullying] happened in places where adults weren\u2019t; it was out of sight of adults,\u201d Hertzog said. \u201cNow it happens with a phone in their hand, sitting there right in the classroom, in an inappropriate text or a group chat ... in places that we don\u2019t, as adults, have access to. It follows that same premise that bullying happens outside of adults.\u201d\n\nAs a result, PACER\u2019s National Bullying Prevention Center offers several resources specifically on cyberbullying, including advice for teaching kids about cyber safety and how to document the abuse they encounter. Kidpower and the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center also feature helpful guides and technology agreements for adults navigating this landscape with the kids in their lives.\n\n\u201cThey might not say, \u2018Someone is bullying me.' They might use the word \u2018drama,\u2019 like, \u2018There\u2019s drama at school.\u2019 There might be that eye roll or they might say, \u2018Nobody likes me at school.\u2019\u201d - Julie Hertzog, director of PACER\u2019s National Bullying Prevention Center\n\nBark.us focuses on keeping children safe online through its parental control technology that monitors the content on kids\u2019 devices. Chief Parenting Officer Titania Jordan told HuffPost that cyberbullying can come in the form of hurtful rumors, impersonations through social media accounts, relentless teasing, explicit images being shared without consent and more. She advised caretakers to encourage kids to reconsider the content they share online.\n\n\u201cWhen you leave school, you don\u2019t leave that behind. When you leave a party, you don\u2019t leave that behind,\u201d she said. \u201cIt follows you because you have a device that receives constant communication.\u201d\n\nSo what can parents do?\n\nWhether the teasing and disrespect occurs in the classroom, at a sports game, online or elsewhere, there are helpful actions parents can take to be proactive about bullying and address it head-on.\n\nHertzog recommended that parents speak to teachers, since they often spend more time with their kids than anyone else during the week. Educators can fill caretakers in on any changing behaviors they might be seeing among students.\n\nHertzog also offered a helpful example of what her family did when her now-adult son, who has Down syndrome and is the inspiration behind much of her work with PACER Center, started kindergarten. She helped teach students at her son\u2019s school about him and his medical history and made sure she got to know the staff. She soon learned that there is \u201can incredible amount of empathy in kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt really became about social inclusion and friendship,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat started as trying to prevent bullying became a beautiful representation of what happens when you provide a structured program, structured content for kids.\u201d\n\nIf parents get word that their child is having issues with bullying, it\u2019s crucial, as van der Zande noted, that they manage their emotional and impulsive reactions, and instead learn how to help in the most effective way.\n\n\u201cIf you run down to the school in your pajamas the minute that your child tells you somebody was mean to them at school,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have less credibility at school and you\u2019re also going to have less credibility with your child.\u201d\n\nEvery expert we spoke with agreed that one of the most important things parents can do is build a foundation so if something is happening at school, on the soccer field or online, their child will feel comfortable coming to them for help and sharing their problems. Kids will go to \u201cpeople they find helpful and supportive,\u201d said Englander.\n\nFor a starting point, van der Zande suggested asking, \u201cIs there anything that you\u2019ve been wondering or worrying about that you haven\u2019t told me?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the first words out of your mouth are, \u2018Thank you for telling me,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThen you listen, and then you say, \u2018Thank you. You\u2019re doing a really good job of explaining this.\u2019 You look for what the child did that was right. You don\u2019t tell them what they did that was wrong.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Alexander C.

Council Speaker Corey Johnson already co-sponsored the legislation, and Councilman Peter Koo, a lawmaker from the Flushing area of eastern Queens, said he would be the bill\u2019s next co-sponsor.\n\nThe bill takes a more ambitious approach than what was set out in August under a first-of-its-kind agreement between the city\u2019s real estate lobby and affordable housing advocates to support legislation that would mandate 80 percent cuts to big building\u2019s pollution by 2050. If the same coalition backs the legislation, it\u2019s expected to pass sometime in the coming months.\n\nThe Real Estate Board of New York, the city\u2019s powerful and deep-pocketed landlord lobby, declined to comment on the specifics outlined by Constantinides\u2019 office and said it had yet to receive a copy of the bill. But in a boilerplate statement to HuffPost, REBNY President John H. Banks said the group remains \u201ccommitted to working with the city to address our shared sustainability goals, and look forward to reviewing the legislation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a lively hearing in December,\u201d Constantinides said, referring to debate on the bill next month. But on its hopes of passing, he said, \u201cI feel very confident right now.\u201d\n\nAlexander C. Kaufman / HuffPost New York City Councilman Costa Constantinides, flanked by housing advocates and environmentalists, announces the introduction of his bill three months after he first said he'd draft legislation to cut emissions from big buildings 80 percent by 2050.\n\nStarting in 2022, the new legislation proposes cutting pollution 40 percent by 2030, a timeline roughly twice as fast as the original agreement brokered by the Urban Green Council, a nonprofit linked to the U.S. Green Building Council that published the framework as a report three months ago. It\u2019ll establish a new Office of Building Energy Performance under the Department of Buildings and set up a 27-member advisory board to guide future emissions cuts through 2050.\n\n\u201cWe can be stricter in requirements, but at this point, we can\u2019t be any looser,\u201d Constantinides said.\n\nThe bill offers protections for the city\u2019s dwindling stock of roughly 990,000 rent-regulated apartments, sparing landlords who own those buildings from expensive retrofit requirements that could be legally passed onto tenants in the form of rent increases of up to 6 percent a year. Instead, the legislation proposes requiring the same auditing for to all buildings over 25,000 square feet that buildings over 50,000 square feet already undergo, a step that avoids rent hikes but increases pressure to decrease energy use in the structures.\n\nThe legislation could change next year if the new Democratic majority in both houses of the state legislature passes stronger tenant protections by the time the state\u2019s rent regulations expire in June.\n\n\u201cWe can retrofit the bill to reflect that,\u201d Constantinides said. But said the city won\u2019t wait for Albany to enact the legislation.\n\nThe bill\u2019s ambition matches that of universal health care proposals like Medicare for all, whereas the original agreement was closer to the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, said Pete Sikora, a senior adviser to the grassroots nonprofit New York Communities for Change.\n\n\u201cI gotta hand it to him: It\u2019s awesome,\u201d Sikora said of Constantinides, noting that the legislation matches the urgency set out by last month\u2019s United Nations report warning that world governments must halve emissions in the next 12 years to avoid catastrophic global warming.\n\nThis rises to the challenge of the U.N.\u2019s report. It\u2019s truly amazing and desperately needed. Pete Sikora, senior adviser to New York Communities for Change\n\n\u201cThis rises to the challenge of the U.N.\u2019s report,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s truly amazing and desperately needed.\u201d\n\nThe bill follows two attempts by Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) to mandate emissions cuts from privately owned buildings, first in 2016 and then again in 2017. The plans went nowhere. In September 2017, the mayor released his second, more-detailed plan without coordinating with his usual environmental allies on the City Council, alienating legislators who were drafting their own bills to cut emissions. They refused to back de Blasio\u2019s proposal.\n\nYet de Blasio has indicated support for Constantinides\u2019 bill.\n\nThe only policy similar to the proposal is a cap-and-trade regulation in Tokyo that allows big commercial landlords in the Japanese capital to buy and sell a limited and shrinking number of CO2 pollution permits.\n\nThe New York City legislation, like other climate policies the city has adopted, is likely to ripple far beyond the five boroughs, which combined have a gross domestic product big enough to rank among the world\u2019s top 20 economies.\n\nIn January, Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) announced a city lawsuit against five major oil companies over infrastructure damage from climate change. A federal judge tossed the suit in July, but California and seven other big states signed onto the city\u2019s appeal last Friday.\n\nThe mayor also started the process of divesting roughly $5 billion in fossil fuel investments from the city\u2019s five pension funds earlier this year, a move other cities quickly followed.\n\nAsked whether the bill will have any bearing on the controversial deal to lure Amazon to open a new headquarters in Long Island City with $3 billion in state and city tax breaks, Constantinides said, \u201cEvery building in the city of New York will have to comply with this standard.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere will be no carve-out,\u201d he said."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Carly Ledbetter", "title": "Here\u2019s How Meghan Markle\u2019s Half-Sister Is Plotting To Upstage The Royal Birth", "description": "Samantha Grant has a plan.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meghan-markle-samantha-grant-tell-all-book_us_5bf42860e4b01909c809be6b", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bc744701d000055003090d6.jpeg?cache=n2g0uotz9o&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T17:25:50Z", "content": "Great things are on the horizon and I have a voice and platform to put to good use really to benefit others and bring about change, said Grant, who has multiple sclerosis.

He\u2019s planning to redevelop the area by adding a hotel, apartments, space for outdoor recreation businesses and a path along the river.\n\nIt\u2019s an unusually ambitious project for a sleepy town of about 20,000, known mostly for an airport where the glitterati disembark on their way to Telluride. And the project is attracting an unusual amount of attention, because it\u2019s in a federally approved \u201copportunity zone\u201d where investors can get a tax break for spending money on certain businesses and property.\n\n\u201cThere are now investors reaching out to us from all around the East Coast,\u201d Dragoo said.

The zones are expected to attract billions of dollars from people eager to reduce their tax bill on money they\u2019ve made selling stocks, bonds or property.\n\nNationally, there are over 8,700 such census tracts, nominated by states for their combination of economic distress and growth potential and approved by the U.S. Treasury Department and IRS earlier this year.\n\nBut as investors start to open their wallets, some local leaders and national economic development experts worry most of the cash will be spent in booming cities. When it does flow to rural places, they warn, it\u2019s more likely to flow to real estate projects such as Dragoo\u2019s rather than to local startups desperate for capital.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried that none of this money is going to flow where it\u2019s really needed,\u201d said Paul Major, president and CEO of the Telluride Foundation, a philanthropic organization that focuses on Western Colorado. \u201cYou can see 99 percent of the money going to urban redevelopment projects and accelerating gentrification.\u201d\n\nFor instance, one of Amazon\u2019s chosen sites for its new headquarters is in an opportunity zone in Queens that\u2019s close to a low-income census tract but is already dense with pricey condos.\n\nBebeto Matthews/The Associated Press A sea gull flies off a former dock facility in the Long Island City section of Queens, New York, an \u201copportunity zone\u201d that was selected by Amazon as the site for one of its new headquarters.\n\nPast tax incentives intended to spur growth in distressed areas, such as the New Markets Tax Credit program, have had mixed success. About 83 percent of New Markets money from 2001 to 2015 went to cities, according to research by Rebecca Lester, an assistant professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business who studies tax policy.\n\nThat may be because more people live in cities, because city projects are better-known, or because urban economies are stronger, Lester said. But she expects opportunity zone money to end up even more concentrated in cities than New Markets money, because there are fewer restrictions on how the money can be spent.\n\nEconomic developers in rural Colorado remain hopeful that with enough preparation and marketing savvy, they can attract investment dollars \u2014 and not just to large, downtown real estate deals.\n\n\u201cThe money has always flowed to the cities, so that\u2019s something that we\u2019re used to,\u201d said Deana Sheriff, economic recovery coordinator for the West End Economic Development Corporation, which works in the outer reaches of Montrose County. \u201cWe just have to work a little harder to make sure our voices are heard as well.\u201d\n\nThe Latest, Greatest Economic Incentive\n\nUnlike other economic development incentives, opportunity zones aren\u2019t a program with a federal, state or local approval process for projects. Congress created some parameters \u2014 for instance, investors can\u2019t just buy a building in a zone, they must improve it.\n\nBut the program is designed to give investors a tax break simply by investing in a given area. \u201cYou could rehab affordable housing and turn it into luxury condos and still get an incentive,\u201d said Brady Meixell, senior research assistant at the Urban Institute. \u201cThere\u2019s no rule against that.\u201d\n\nTo get the tax benefit, people must invest their capital gains in an opportunity zone fund, which in turn invests in businesses or property in a zone. Investors can defer paying taxes on their gains right away. They earn a 15 percent tax cut on those gains if they hold on to their shares for seven years.\n\nAnd if they hold on to their shares for 10 years, they don\u2019t have to pay income taxes on money they make when the shares increase in value.\n\n\u201cThose tax benefits are huge,\u201d said Chris Montgomery, founder and managing director of Four Points Funding, a real estate investing group based in Steamboat Springs, at a recent conference for economic developers in Estes Park, Colorado.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not big enough to make a bad investment good,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they\u2019re really significant.\u201d\n\nThe IRS released some guidance last month but has yet to clarify all the details of the tax break. Until it does \u2014 probably early next year, lobbyists say \u2014 many investors are holding off on taking an equity stake in a business or building a structure in an opportunity zone.\n\nIn hot real estate markets such as the Denver area (Montrose is located on the other side of the state), however, opportunity zones already have set off a fundraising frenzy.\n\nAndrew Klein owns 750 acres in an opportunity zone in Aurora, not far from Denver International Airport. The land around the airport, once home mostly to prairie dogs, is now filling up with subdivisions, hotels and business parks.\n\nKlein\u2019s company, Westside Investment Partners Inc., is planning to construct industrial buildings that could house businesses such as data centers and logistics companies.\n\nHe said he\u2019s talked to many investors, from wealthy Coloradans to national groups that handle family fortunes. The people he\u2019s talked to are, collectively, willing to spend some $100 million on his project, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m currently out in New York City meeting with people who want to develop in opportunity zones,\u201d he said when he spoke to Stateline last week.\n\nYuriy Gorlov, a vice president of the Aurora Economic Development Council, said that some local landowners and developers are putting together seven- and eight-figure investment funds.\n\nThe money flowing in will help accelerate development around the airport, he said. \u201cInstead of taking the next 20 years to build out a large swath of land out there, maybe it\u2019ll take 10 years.\u201d\n\nRural Investment\n\nRural Colorado presents investors with fewer obvious moneymaking opportunities. While Denver and other cities along Colorado\u2019s Front Range have rapidly added people and jobs in recent years, many rural places are shrinking as farming and some mining jobs disappear.\n\nRecognizing that rural places such as Montrose County need a boost, the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade gave the federal government a list of opportunity zones skewed toward rural areas.\n\nOnly 40 percent of the state\u2019s 126 zones are in the Front Range, according to Jana Persky, strategic initiatives manager for the development office.\n\nPersky has been crisscrossing the state for months, speaking at conferences and meeting with local leaders to explain the opportunity zone incentive and encourage communities to start promoting themselves and lining up projects to pitch to investors.\n\n\u201cInvestors are finding it,\u201d she said of the incentive. \u201cWe want to make sure that communities are equally informed and equally prepared.\u201d\n\nMontrose hasn\u2019t had to do much to market itself, thanks to a July Forbes article that name-dropped the county and called opportunity zones \u201cthe most unbelievable tax break ever.\u201d\n\nStateline\n\nAfter the article was published, \u201cthe phone started ringing off the hook,\u201d Montrose\u2019s mayor, Roy Anderson, said, adding that he expects multiple businesses to relocate to the town in the next six to nine months, partly because of the opportunity zones.\n\nSmaller towns west of Montrose haven\u2019t gotten as much attention. Sheriff of the West End Economic Development Corporation is working with three tiny communities in a remote and rugged region near the Utah border: Naturita (population 500), Norwood (600), and Nucla (700).\n\nBoth Nucla and Naturita\u2019s main streets look like stretches of highway, Sheriff said. \u201cThe town of Naturita literally does not have sidewalks.\u201d The towns are hoping their zone designations will lead to improving sidewalks and renovating buildings.\n\nHer office also is compiling data to convince investors that there\u2019s demand for housing in the area. \u201cWe\u2019ve got folks that want to move into the region, but there\u2019s simply no place\u201d to house them, she said.\n\nIn many rural places, investors likely will have to take advantage of not just the opportunity zone but layers of other incentives to make money, economic development experts say.\n\n\u201cDeals aren\u2019t just going to surface,\u201d said Major of the Telluride Foundation. They\u2019ll need to be put together using everything from foundation grants to state job training assistance, state tax credits, and a state and local program that pays companies up to $10,000 for every new job created, he said.\n\nCommunities may need to go the extra mile to draw investment to needed projects that aren\u2019t particularly lucrative, such as a day care center or affordable housing, Major said. \u201cAre there parcels of land that nobody thought about, that the town owns? The town could donate that to do a housing project that opportunity zone capital can invest in.\u201d\n\nBusinesses Need Not Apply (Yet)\n\nThe architects of the opportunity zone incentive intended capital gains to flow to businesses as well as real estate. But investors have shown less enthusiasm in taking an equity stake or partnership interest in businesses.\n\nThis is partly because it\u2019s harder to make money that way and partly because the IRS has yet to finalize how such investments must be structured.\n\nAccording to the IRS rules so far, investors must put their money into businesses that generate half their gross income within the zone. That\u2019s a problem, because investors are most interested in growth businesses that sell regionally or nationally, said Montgomery of Four Points Funding.\n\nEven though he\u2019s hoping his fund will invest in real estate and businesses, he said it\u2019ll likely invest more in real estate.\n\n\u201cMost people that are raising money are doing it just for real estate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an easier path forward.\u201d\n\nMajor noted that it\u2019s hard to make a profit investing and growing a business, particularly in a rural area. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to have a Google, or Amazon, or a Facebook in a distressed, rural community.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re going to have is small, medium-sized businesses that grow slowly.\u201d\n\nMajor has been helping Natalie Binder, a vacation rental manager based in Telluride, look for funding for her passion project: a camp near Nucla and Naturita that could become a destination for people who want to escape Colorado\u2019s increasingly crowded mountain towns.\n\nShe\u2019s envisioning cabins, platforms for tents, a vintage bus used as a check-in desk, and funky art made of junk \u2014 \u201ckind of like a Burning Man meets Marfa meets Colorado,\u201d she said, adding that she reached out to some investors working on opportunity funds, but they didn\u2019t bite.\n\n\u201cThey were too busy to even talk,\u201d she said. She\u2019s hoping to find investors who are interested in the project with or without the zone designation.\n\nIf the final IRS rules skew the incentive almost entirely toward real estate, \u201cthen that\u2019s a big failure,\u201d said John Lettieri, president and CEO of the Economic Innovation Group.\n\nThe Washington, D.C.-based organization, created by Napster founder Sean Parker, came up with the opportunity zone idea and lobbied Congress to include the incentive in the tax law.\n\nBut real estate development can be beneficial, Lettieri said, if it sets the stage for businesses to move to and expand in distressed communities. \u201cFor many of these communities, the built environment is the first step to broader economic growth.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why Montgomery sees potential in Dragoo\u2019s project, which would cluster apartments, businesses and amenities such as restaurants \u2014 creating an attractive place for people to live and work."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Ron Dicker", "title": "Martha Stewart's First Uber Ride Is A Recipe For Disaster", "description": "The lifestyle maven said \"the car was a mess inside and out!!!!!!!!\" and Dictionary.com teased her for it.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/martha-stewart-uber-first-ride_us_5bf41bfee4b0376c9e68fc6a", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf424692200004305de3e81.png?cache=M44L0JvUdy&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T17:16:09Z", "content": "The 77-year-old doyenne of domesticity wrote in a now-deleted Instagram post that when she first ordered the \u201cmost expensive version\u201d of Uber to pick her up in front of Tiffany\u2019s in New York City, the car didn\u2019t show up.

In other words, it\u2019s fantastic.\n\nMost period pieces about royal courts result in inspirational folly (\u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d) or shadowy theatrics (\u201cThe Other Boleyn Girl\u201d). But \u201cThe Favourite\u201d does not adhere to convention, which will come as no surprise to anyone familiar with its director, Yorgos Lanthimos, a Greek satirist who targeted the nuclear family structure in \u201cDogtooth,\u201d coupledom in \u201cThe Lobster\u201d and quotidian destiny in \u201cThe Killing of a Sacred Deer.\u201d Queen Anne\u2019s reign is hardly a predictable arena for Lanthimos\u2019 twisted humor, but it turns out he is the perfect person to prod the stateliness expected from palace confines.\n\nThat much is evident from the film\u2019s opening scene, in which Anne (Olivia Colman) gifts her most treasured courtier, Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz), a castle. Sarah, a top-ranking military officer\u2019s wife, says the gesture is much too generous, considering their kingdom is embroiled in a controversial and expensive war with France. \u201cWe won,\u201d Anne protests. Sarah informs her that, actually, no, the fighting is to continue. \u201cOh,\u201d Anne responds, eyeing the floor with sudden bemusement. \u201cOh. I did not know that.\u201d\n\nEmma Stone in \"The Favourite.\"\n\nA back-and-forth this droll is quintessential Lanthimos, even if Lanthimos is not credited on the movie\u2019s screenplay. (Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara wrote it.) \u201cThe Favourite\u201d spends its first half-hour doubling down on such whimsy. Politicians race ducks to pass the time, Anne commands an attendant to look at her and then scolds him for doing so, vassals perform ridiculous (and anachronistic) choreographed dances, and Sarah tells a scheming House of Commons dandy (Nicholas Hoult) that she cannot take him seriously when his mascara is running. Nearly every line is a delicious barb, presenting the assumed austerity of the 18th-century British crown as little more than a buffet of sensationalistic machinations. Anne\u2019s verdict on raising landowners\u2019 taxes to extend the war \u2015 a decision with devastating implications for her constituents \u2015 rests on whether Sarah (who supports the hike) or the mascaraed statesmen (who, in a rival move, wants a treaty) better appeals to her image-conscious insecurities.\n\n\u201cThe Favourite\u201d spends its two-hour runtime cascading head-on into a delicious hurricane, and around the 30-minute mark, Anne finds herself judging a very different contest. The ongoing war is relegated to the background, Lanthimos twisting the genre\u2019s hallmarks \u2014 lavish costuming, a feuding parliament, a vulnerable monarch \u2014 to chronicle an indecisive ruler caught in a battle of manners waged by Abigail (Emma Stone), a fresh-faced scullery maid dropped on the castle\u2019s muddy lawn in the film\u2019s inaugural moments. She is desperate to escape servitude. One night, when Abigail isn\u2019t either scrubbing a floor or sleeping on one, she spies Anne and Sarah in a dim corridor, discovering they are, well, more than friends. Pinpointing the queen\u2019s sapphic proclivities as a way to curry favor, Abigail launches a fight far more intriguing than the one Sarah\u2019s husband is off leading: that of a viper so anxious to achieve aristocracy that she\u2019s willing to pit herself against the master of manipulation.\n\nFox Searchlight Nicholas Hoult in \"The Favourite.\"\n\nAnne takes a liking to Abigail, who knowingly ignites the queen\u2019s attention by concocting an herbal remedy that soothes Anne\u2019s gout. But Sarah catches on quickly, striking back first with a soft verbal vengeance and then with an all-out antagonism. Forget the duck races or the battlefield horrors. The real tournament is the one unfolding between a woman clawing her way to power and another woman refusing to have hers displaced. Anne is as much a bystander as she is a benefactor; having lost her husband and suffered 17 failed pregnancies, she is susceptible to depression and guilelessness. No matter how many corseted paramours enter her boudoir, Anne\u2019s life is largely one of solitude, indigestion and steep responsibility \u2014 hardly an easy cocktail to swig.\n\nLanthimos knows how to milk those dynamics for maximum impact. \u201cThe Favourite\u201d is both an uproarious comedy and a sneaky thriller, as the love triangle yields tart bonhomies as much as it does what-will-they-do-next chicanery. The film is wise to emphasize the palace\u2019s overwhelming grandeur, as Lanthimos and cinematographer Robbie Ryan (\u201cAmerican Honey,\u201d \u201cPhilomena\u201d) often frame characters as small figures within the vast rooms and courtyards that envelop their drama. There\u2019s a slick punk-rock sensibility to a movie that looks this beautiful but lets its regal subjects delve so brazenly into matters of the vulva. Even the routine fisheye lenses, an indulgence that seems to serve no narrative purpose, are forgivable when everything else is so purposefully plotted and captivatingly captured.\n\nIt also helps that the three central performances are pitch-perfect, especially that of Colman, who worked with Lanthimos on \u201cThe Lobster\u201d and won a Golden Globe for \u201cThe Night Manager.\u201d She affixes in Anne a permanent state of confusion, broken only by the fleeting self-satisfaction that accompanies her mistresses\u2019 cajolery. But no matter where Sarah and Abigail stand, we know Anne as a person of deep dimension, someone thrust into leadership despite personal strife. Colman is equal parts hilarious and heartbreaking, an ideal partner for Weisz\u2019s steely resolve and Stone\u2019s anxious cunning.\n\nFox Searchlight Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz in \"The Favourite.\"\n\nOne telling throughline tackles how the two women treat the pet rabbits Anne keeps \u2014 17 in total, each representing one of her late children. Farce and pathos intermingle, the former giving way to the latter in affecting bursts. By the time the movie reaches its climax, the dangerous liaisons leave behind an air of melancholy, sending us out on a somber note that thankfully doesn\u2019t dehydrate all the soapy amusements preceding it.\n\nAre the details historically accurate? Who cares. (For what it\u2019s worth, historians have speculated about Anne\u2019s sexuality, and we know the real Sarah and Abigail competed to be her right-hand adviser, whatever that might have entailed.) Someone or another will always put courtly tales to the smell test, but Lanthimos achieves something that defies such rigors: a story that presents power as a seductive force, even an addiction. Women outmaneuver the men in congress, and they outmaneuver one another as well \u2014 an equal-opportunity arms race to ensure that those accustomed to privilege do not let themselves fall by the wayside.\n\nIn keeping, \u201cThe Favourite\u201d is a poignant yarn, rechristening a fascinating filmmaker whose reputation continues to soar. It\u2019s also the most fun you\u2019ll have in a movie theater this year."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Marina Fang", "title": "Walmart Drops Mississippi GOP Senator After Joking About Public Hangings", "description": "The retailer joins two other corporate donors seeking refunds from Sen.

No Sun,\u201d the new album \u2015 released on Friday \u2015 also features longtime Smashing Pumpkins guitarist Jeff Schroeder. It coincides with a 30th-anniversary tour that kicks off Nov. 28. For the outing, Smashing Pumpkins will dive into their entire catalog, tapping into new material, as well as the hit \u201990s albums released before their split, including \u201cSiamese Dream\u201d and \u201cMellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\u201d\n\nCorgan called it a \u201ctriumph\u201d that they\u2019re even back together. \u201cThe fact that we were just able to get in a room and make music is the victory in and of itself,\u201d he said.\n\nPrior to the album release, we caught up with Corgan via phone about repairing old wounds, making new music and what\u2019s next.\n\nSo, it\u2019s just a week or so ahead of the new album release. Is that something that\u2019s old hat to you at this point, or do you still get the jitters or excitement around it?\n\nIt\u2019s always a bit nervy because the reaction is never what you think it\u2019s going to be, even if you think you know what you think it\u2019s going to be. There\u2019s always some wrinkle in there that surprises you, you know?\n\nHow are you feeling about this album, having reunited with some of the guys and everything?\n\nI mean, from an internal point of view, it feels great just to make music with them again, and it was such a relaxed environment because of all the years, the work that we had done, we just kind of went right back into that so that was a really pleasant time, and rewarding. You know, we\u2019d managed to do something that we thought would never happen. The response has been really positive, and I just always raised a little bit of an eyebrow because when people start talking about what it reminds them of past or present, I always get like, eh, you know. I know that\u2019s an inaccurate read. But you\u2019re oftentimes put in a position of sort of having to answer for a perceptional thing that you don\u2019t agree upon.\n\nFor you, what does it represent to you, the new album?\n\nI think it\u2019s a triumph that we were able to get in the room, as maybe grandiose as that sounds. I mean, the fact that we were just able to get in a room and make music is the victory in and of itself. The blessing is that we were able to make good music. And I think the thing that I did that was good was I just let it happen. I didn\u2019t try to say it has to be like this, or it can\u2019t be like this. I just let the music that we make together be what it is.\n\nI didn\u2019t try to elevate it or weigh it down under some conceptual artifice. I just let it be, and that\u2019s where [producer] Rick [Rubin] really comes into play. He picked great songs and emphasized making sure that those songs came through clearly in terms of their messaging and the musical sort of statement behind them. And I know this isn\u2019t a great word for rock and roll, but it just feels really relaxed to me. Which is the opposite of what you would think, you know, after all these years, and at this point.\n\nLinda Strawberry Smashing Pumpkins scored hit songs in the '90s with \"1979\" and \"Tonight Tonight.\"\n\nWhat did Rick Rubin bring to the fold?\n\nWell I mean, the biggest thing is, we thought we were just going to do one song and he wanted to do eight. So, we suddenly found ourselves sort of thrown into a deeper kind of thing than we had expected. And the first thing that hits you is like, wait, we haven\u2019t worked under this kind of stress. ... We haven\u2019t been in this kind of stress in the recording studio since 1999.\n\nSuddenly, you\u2019re kind of like, wait, I\u2019m not sure we necessarily want to jump into the deep end of the pool so quick. We just managed to put this thing back together to tour, which is a fragile thing in and of itself. And now we want to suddenly be in the studio for the long days sort of picking songs and everybody, of course, has a seat at the table. ... There was no stress. It was weird. It was just like we just kind of rolled our sleeves up and said, \u201cFine, OK.\u201d And we just went to work. ... We released so much music in the decade-plus that we were together that we just reverted back to our old kind of job descriptions.\n\nWhat do you think it was about this time, this year, that made it happen for you guys to come together?\n\nThat\u2019s hard to say because for two years, James and I had been kind of reconnecting and speaking again and just to rebuild the personal relationship to where you could talk about business and it wasn\u2019t this kind of anxiety thing of, \u201cOh, if I say the wrong thing, this is going to blow up.\u201d Get it back to a place, the family, where you can kind of be your messy self and it\u2019s OK. I think that\u2019s a two-way street, you know what I mean? Nobody\u2019s perfect in the room here. The process of just kind of repairing the personal relationships to where they could sustain a long tour and actually talking about a plan beyond four months. ... Sitting at a table with your bandmates is saying, \u201cOK, what do we really want to accomplish here?\u201d\n\nJames came out recently in an interview and said he didn\u2019t think new music was necessary. If you read that the wrong way, it almost sounds dismissive, but that\u2019s not reflective of his attitude. His attitude is more kind of like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m cool if you guys want to do music and I\u2019m cool if you didn\u2019t want to do music. You know I\u2019m kind of cool with however way this is going to go.\u201d For me, it has to be about new music or I just don\u2019t see why you would call it a band. Then it\u2019s more like one of those shows where they put the same cast together, like \u201cMurphy Brown\u201d or something. I\u2019m really not interested in that, even though I realize we\u2019re in a culture that sort of celebrates those things.\n\nLaura June Kirsch Corgan says there were many times he nearly gave up on music.\n\nAt the same time, there is that nostalgia aspect to a band that\u2019s been on and off for some 30 years. What\u2019s your relationship like with that part of your history?\n\nI fought it for many years and I lost. What do you get in my surrender? A, I accepted the public\u2019s expectation without complaint. Then B, from my Piscean brain, it gets into, OK if that\u2019s the way that it is, is there a way that you can embrace this that feels good and positive? And not grumbling under your breath like, well, this is the way I\u2019ve gotta do it. Once I was able to accept it, I got on with the business of, well how would I approach this in a way that I feel really positive about. What I really found, particularly with the live side, was creating a staging and a narrative form around the music that allowed me to express my ideas in the present without having to compromise the music of the past.\n\nAnd finding that balance point. Honestly, it was Roger Waters, both professionally in the way that he staged Pink Floyd\u2019s music, but also talking to him privately a few times. He really helped me kind of see his visions. I was able to kind of adapt some of that to myself and, in my way, feel like I was breathing new life into something.\n\nAt the same time, you\u2019ve continued to put out new music. You have your solo record. Different band members. To what do you owe your longevity in the business? A lot of people just give up or move on.\n\nWell, I almost gave up many, many times. This might sound like an odd answer but it\u2019s really thinking a lot about my ancestors. I came from really poor people. Immigrant people. If I was to sit at a table with them, I mean, they\u2019re long departed, and tell them, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m just going to blow all this off because I just don\u2019t like the way it feels.\u201d They would laugh at me, you know? They were a tougher breed of people than I am. And I\u2019ve oftentimes tried to think through their eyes how they would view the opportunity. If you\u2019re going to throw away an opportunity, fine, but at least know what opportunity you\u2019re throwing away. And I think when I really examined the opportunity, and I realized there was still a lot of good to be done, including helping bring my band back together, and really heal a wound that really needs to be healed. Not just for us, but even for a lot of fans.\n\nI just had to grow up and really appreciate, really only in America could you have this wild life that I\u2019ve had. Billy Corgan\n\nThey felt very grieved by the situation. ... But if they look up to you and you can\u2019t do the thing that they\u2019re asked to do all the time in their own lives, which is, you know, mend fences and move forward, particularly within a family, it\u2019s very painful for them. Because on some sort of meta-level, they see you as part of their family. When you can\u2019t put your family back together, it\u2019s aggrieving to them. It\u2019s like, how is this possible? You guys just can\u2019t get in a room and just kind of get over it?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of dreamy stuff in there, but the point being, I just had to grow up and really appreciate, really only in America could you have this wild life that I\u2019ve had. And live this crazy dream and also be willing to throw it away, jump up and down on it. It still survives, you know? There\u2019s something pretty magical about that.\n\nIt is wild, just looking at your career. I can\u2019t even imagine what it was like. The rise to fame, what kind of toll or excitement did that bring to you, looking back on it now, 20, 30 years later?\n\nWell, I mean, just to give you context, \u201992 we were playing a solo club, and four years later we\u2019re playing Madison Square Garden, sold out. There is no way to prepare yourself for that kind of rise. And certainly our family backgrounds weren\u2019t much help. Broken homes. Although James came from a two-parent home, so I don\u2019t want to throw him under that bus. When you start off and your aspiration is to sell out the local club and then you find yourself on MTV and there\u2019s tabloid articles about you dating supermodels and it\u2019s all kind of like, wow, this is pretty wild. This is right at the dawn of the digital age. We found ourselves stumbling into this new technology, not really understanding not only how it would change the way people interacted and saw one another, but also change the music business and send it on a downward spiral for about 15 years.\n\nKMazur via Getty Images Corgan and Iha perform at the Tibetan Freedom Concert in 1996.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like riding the crest of a massive wave and it is the wave of your generation. As anybody who accomplishes something in a particular generation, they get the benefit of that wave. When that wave crests and starts to come down, it didn\u2019t just come down to its natural place to make way for the next generation, it crashed even further because of the changes in technology and streaming. File sharing. We found ourselves on the back end of a lot of weird stuff. Suddenly, from a lot of resources to not a lot, because the music business was bottoming out.\n\nNapalm Records The new album's cover art.\n\nWhat\u2019s the vibe being on the road together again?\n\nI think that the best way I can describe it is, it was such a long winter for all of us that it feels nice just to be in the sunshine a bit. ... I think for the three of us just to be in the room and it to be very warm and have the sense that the 30 years has added up to something, that the music has endured. To see a lot of young people coming to shows is like, that\u2019s the ultimate compliment. And certainly our, not to be too insidery, but we look at our Spotify numbers and stuff and it\u2019s crazy. Like, the younger generation is almost equal to the older generation that listens to the band. Which is wild. Because we\u2019re like, wow, you know, this means there\u2019s a future, you know? It\u2019s not just this diminishing set of returns for an audience that, as we all do as we get older and have kids and stuff \u2015 music is less of a centerpiece of our focus. So it\u2019s great. It just feels really nice. Not words you would normally associate with Smashing Pumpkins, \u201cwarm and nice.\u201d It\u2019s a cuddly period, let\u2019s put it that way.\n\nDo you think this period will continue and for how long? I know it\u2019s hard to predict, but do you think the momentum will continue?\n\nI think, ultimately, there\u2019s the choice that needs to be made. It doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be made tomorrow. You can be that band that people would like you to be for a very long time. There\u2019s plenty of indication now in the culture that people are willing to see bands all the way into their 70s. So you could chart a path forward and say, well, as long as we keep playing these songs in these ways for as long as we can, we\u2019re able, there\u2019s the path there.\n\nI\u2019m much more interested in whether or not we can once more tap a deeper vein, creatively, and come up with work that is not only as contemporaneously received well, but we actually start to lean our influence back into the culture and have something more to say than, like, oh, I like your new album and that\u2019s cool. You know? In essence, we go to being received to having an influence."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Nina Golgowski", "title": "Reports: Sister Of 5-Year-Old Baltimore Shooting Victim Fatally Shot In July", "description": "The child was rushed to a hospital after being caught in a shootout, police said.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shooting-victims-sister-wounded-baltimore_us_5bf40dcae4b0376c9e68d07e", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf41f43240000040499ba1b.png?cache=000My8hKRR&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T16:01:33Z", "content": "A 5-year-old girl who was shot in Baltimore on Monday evening is reportedly the sister of a 7-year-old girl who was fatally shot in a similar shooting in July.

The question is whether she\u2019ll be able to get the 218 votes needed in January, when the full Congress votes.

Read the full letter below:\n\nOPEN LETTER TO HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS\n\nWe write in response to recent discussions in the press about the upcoming election of a Speaker of the House Of Representatives, in particular whether Nancy Pelosi has sufficient support in your caucus to win the post. We understand and respect the fact that you are all much better informed about your internal deliberations than any of us, that this is your matter to decide. That is as it should be.\n\nHowever, as long time supporters of your caucus, and given the affection, and more importantly the respect, we have for Nancy, we feel compelled to share our view.\n\nObviously we don\u2019t have to explain to your group the enormous value Nancy brings as Leader. Her effectiveness was the single most important element in achieving passage of the ACA. Moreover, from a public perspective, the Caucus has had seamless unanimity as our country labors under the Trump/McConnell/Ryan assault on our democratic institutions, never-ending scandals, gross incompetence, and so much more.\n\nBecause of her diligence, her powers of persuasion, her enormous effectiveness and her adherence to our values, we have provided a portion of the financial resources required to be competitive cycle after cycle. We look forward to a day when we achieve the reforms necessary to reduce greatly the impact of money in elections. But until that day we must do what is required to contest the Republicans on an equal playing field.\n\nWhen it came to funding this recent effort to retake the Majority, would we have contributed anywhere near as much as we did if Nancy was not the Leader? We think not.\n\nWe do not mean to suggest that our support is personality driven rather than intended to facilitate the adoption of public policies consistent with our values. We fund these efforts because we want to give our kids and grandkids the same America our parents gave us.\n\nBut we do believe the competence and effectiveness of the Leader is a critical component in motivating us to reach in our pockets. On that basis it is hard to imagine a replacement for Nancy engendering the same level of confidence at this critical time. Your recent success in winning the majority is only a first step in changing our country\u2019s direction. As critical as it was, the coming cycle is even more so.\n\nInserting ourselves into internal House Politics is not something we would normally do. But if we lose Nancy, and the new Leader can only raise half the funding, the Republicans will not reduce their funding and we will be back to the structural disadvantage that prevailed for many years.\n\nAgain, we respect the fact that this is your prerogative, but are hopeful you will take our views into consideration as you make this most important decision.\n\nOne final point - we did not share with Nancy our intention to write this note, secure in the knowledge she would likely have forbade its publication!"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Carly Ledbetter", "title": "Amy Schumer Shares Another Pregnancy Pic To Explain Why She's Bumping Tour Dates", "description": "The comedian recently announced she's suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amy-schumer-canceling-dates-pregnancy-pic_us_5bf41b5ae4b0376c9e68fbc4", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf420581d0000e201313417.png?cache=LhtPKFETZS&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T15:48:04Z", "content": "Amy Schumer revealed a photo of her stomach to explain to fans why she won\u2019t be able to make a few West Coast dates on her comedy tour.

Just three days after the funeral she\u2019d planned with her siblings, the 50-year-old returned to work at the Toys R Us store she managed in Boynton Beach, Florida. She had to liquidate all its inventory and her 30-year career.\n\nThe bedlam of the going-out-of-business sale made it feel more like the holidays than springtime. Garcia was on her feet for 12-hour days, six days a week, with no overtime pay and no future at the company. What kept her going was the possibility of Toys R Us finding a buyer and at least some of the stores being saved. But she also felt a basic sense of commitment to the retailer, even in bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the loyalty we had to the company,\u201d explained Garcia, a mother of three who started her career at a Toys R Us in New Jersey in 1988. \u201cI think we did it for each other, too. We were all going through difficult times not knowing where we would go or how we would manage.\u201d\n\nOnce the store\u2019s fixtures were going out the door, the reality began to set in. Toys R Us\u2019 creditors rejected any offers to purchase the company. Garcia\u2019s store closed June 30. There were no jobs and, worst of all, Garcia believed, no severance pay for her employees, many of whom still hadn\u2019t found new employers. The sense of commitment, she realized, only went in one direction.\n\nGarcia is now at the center of a battle that could have long-lasting implications for retail workers. She and other Toys R Us veterans have been trying to squeeze severance pay out of the private equity groups that bought the retailer, as well as the investment firms that held its debt.\n\nTheir campaign has already yielded results. On Tuesday, two of the company\u2019s owners, the private equity groups Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Bain Capital, announced that they would each put $10 million into a financial assistance fund for the workers. The distribution of the money will be overseen by Kenneth Feinberg and Camille Biros, high-profile lawyers known for their experience administering compensation funds. The amount workers receive will be based on their length of tenure at the company.\n\nKKR and Bain called it \u201ca unique set of circumstances that called for a unique solution\u201d and urged other stakeholders to chip in money.\n\nStill, the Toys R Us workers are demanding a much larger fund, totaling $75 million, to be shared among the laid-off workforce of more than 30,000. They also want to draw public attention to retail\u2019s looming private-equity problem and make sure all retail workers \u2015 most of them women, and many living paycheck to paycheck in a largely non-union industry \u2015 enjoy some basic protections if their companies go under. They have taken their fight to corporate lobbies, Congress and the courts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think private equity firms should be able to buy a company, load it up with debt, liquidate it and have nothing for the workers,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cWe did all the work in the stores and in the warehouses\u2026. We shouldn\u2019t walk out empty-handed.\u201d\n\nThe way these workers see it, Toys R Us wasn\u2019t solely a victim of Amazon and the Digital Age.\n\nJulio Cortez/ASSOCIATED PRESS Cheryl Claude, an assistant manager at the Toys R Us store in Woodbridge, New Jersey, holds a sign in front of the Totowa, location on June 1, after the company announced that employees will not get severance packages once the stores are closed.\n\nBain and KKR, along with the realty trust Vornado, bought Toys R Us in a leveraged buyout in 2005. The deal loaded the company up with around $5 billion in debt. Toys R Us was on the hook for annual interest payments of $400 million in the years leading up to its demise. Those obligations would have made it hard for the foundering retailer to invest in its workforce, upgrade its stores and adapt to online shopping. The chain was in business for 60 years and had 735 stores when it announced plans to close.\n\nToys R Us is far from the only brick-and-mortar retailer saddled with debt through a leveraged buyout. Even if sales and the economy on the whole are humming, Bloomberg predicts the so-called retail apocalypse will accelerate as these debts come due. Delinquent loans could endanger a sector that employs 16 million Americans, many of them earning close to the minimum wage with little or no money saved.\n\n\u201cClearly, this is not unique to Toys R Us,\u201d said Eileen Appelbaum, an economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research who has studied the effects of leveraged buyouts on retail and grocery workers. \u201cWe\u2019re only talking about this because [the workers], like the Parkland kids, protested. They said, \u2018We built this, we\u2019re entitled to severance and we want it.\u2019 That\u2019s why people know the Toys R Us story.\u201d\n\nBecause of the way bankruptcy laws are written, low-level employees tend to be last at the trough, behind a long line of creditors, when a company like Toys R Us goes under. Meanwhile, executives often make out just fine. Former Toys R Us CEO Dave Brandon received a $2.8 million \u201cretention\u201d bonus just before the retailer filed for bankruptcy late last year, part of a total compensation package that topped $6 million in 2017.\n\nAll store workers got was a 60-day heads-up that they would be losing their jobs. But even that wasn\u2019t a courtesy. It was an obligation under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, a federal law that requires advance notice for employees hit by mass layoffs.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to see Toys R Us become a tipping point in this,\u201d said Carrie Gleason, policy director at the Organization United for Respect, a retail worker center advocating for former Toys R Us employees. \u201cYou\u2019ll see moms in hearings about bankruptcy reform. You\u2019ll see state-level severance funds created. These women are powerful voices about the real-world impact when there are no rules.\u201d\n\nGarcia realized she wasn\u2019t alone when she saw a video on Facebook of laid-off Toys R Us workers talking with Sen. Bernie Sanders in his office on Capitol Hill. The Vermont independent and former presidential candidate was pillorying the private equity groups for not providing severance pay. In the video produced by Sanders\u2019 office, workers tearfully recounted their own financial hardships.\n\n\u201cIt was my same scenario,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cOnce I saw that video clip, I thought, \u2018Oh, no, I have to be part of this. It\u2019s an important fight.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe campaign took on the name Rise Up Retail, which is funded by the Organization United for Respect and the liberal advocacy group Center for Popular Democracy. Through Rise Up Retail, Garcia met fellow Toys R Us veterans agitating for severance pay, like Maryjane Williams.\n\nMichael Starghill for HuffPost Maryjane Williams, after 20 years with Toys R Us, took a lower position and a $15,000 pay cut for a position at another big-box store.\n\nWilliams lost her job after two decades with the company, helping run Toys R Us stores in New York and later Waco, Texas, where she now lives with her husband. After the layoff, she had to take a lower position \u2015 and a roughly $15,000 pay cut, she estimates \u2015 at another big-box store. She landed the job because a previous supervisor at Toys R Us helped her out.\n\n\u201cI worked for the company for 20 years,\u201d said Williams. \u201cAt the age of 50, where am I going? What am I going to do?\u201d\n\nI worked for the company for 20 years. At the age of 50, where am I going? What am I going to do? Maryjane Williams\n\nMany of the workers bonded over their common experience at Toys R Us. The company was different from other retailers, and not just because of its iconic giraffe and jingle. Working in a store devoted exclusively to children meant that managers and longtime hourly employees literally watched their customers grow up. As a kid once explained to Garcia, Walmart and Target may have toys, but those are mom\u2019s stores: \u201cHe said, \u2019I love Toys R Us because this store is for me.\u2019\u201d\n\nPart of that shared experience is less rosy. Former Toys R Us employees have plenty of anecdotes about how their stores went downhill after the leveraged buyout. In some locations, the company cut the number of managers and moved full-time workers to part-time, even though the amount of work remained the same, according to Williams. The frequency of floor cleanings was cut back, making some stores dingy. Williams said the air conditioning in her Texas store \u201cwas out half the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could see the effects of the debt,\u201d she said.\n\nIn June, a group of workers met in New York to protest outside the offices of KKR, Bain and Vornado, and deliver petitions to the firms demanding severance. All told, 75 workers from 14 states made the trip, according to Garcia. The workers hatched a plan to hold a silent protest in their stores before they closed so that customers would realize they were being let go without a parachute.\n\nThe participants all wore signs on their store uniforms shaming ownership for the lack of severance. Garcia\u2019s said, \u201cI worked 30 years and I get nothing.\u201d She encouraged all the workers in her store to wear one. Roughly 40 of them did.\n\nThe group tried pressuring the private equity firms through the pension funds that invest in them. The workers succeeded in getting Minnesota\u2019s pension plan to stop investing in KKR until it pledged money for the severance fund. They met with more than a dozen pension funds to persuade them to pull their money out of the firms.\n\nMichael Starghill for HuffPost Maryjane Williams is among former Toys R Us employees who are agitating to get severance pay for laid-off workers.\n\nLately, the workers have turned their sights on Toys R Us\u2019 main creditors: the firms Solus Alternative Asset Management, Highland Capital, Franklin Mutual Advisers, Angelo Gordon and Oaktree Capital. In August, The Wall Street Journal reported that those firms essentially blocked a Toys R Us reorganization effort that might have salvaged some stores.\n\nOaktree Capital was the only firm to comment when asked whether it planned to contribute to the severance fund. A spokesperson said the firm did not have \u201cany role or influence whatsoever\u201d in the decision to liquidate the retailer, and that it wouldn\u2019t be fair to its investors to put up money \u201cto compensate for losses that our funds and our clients had nothing to do with creating.\u201d\n\nThe severance campaign\u2019s political support has continued to grow. In October, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a potential 2020 presidential candidate, sent a letter to the creditors asking why they did not try to reorganize the company. She dashed off a separate letter to Vornado recommending the company chip in to the severance fund.\n\nJust days earlier, Garcia had taken part in yet another protest in Manhattan, in the lobby of Solus, the largest holder of Toys R Us debt. Solus is reportedly considering relaunching the Toys R Us brand and may soon have pop-up-style shops inside Kroger grocery stores. But it isn\u2019t clear how former Toys R Us workers like Garcia figure in that plan, if at all.\n\n\u201cI think in the retail industry, we\u2019re undervalued, the workers,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThis fight is for everyone, not just myself. And it\u2019s not just about money. It\u2019s for everyone who worked for Toys R Us and put years into the company. It\u2019s important to me that our voices get heard.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Ron Dicker", "title": "Jada Pinkett Smith Says She Pulled Knife On Drunk Boyfriend", "description": "A harrowing \"Red Table Talk\" about her father beating her mother led to the actress's revelation.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jada-pinkett-smith_us_5bf3dd3fe4b0376c9e6874cb", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf3fd10240000040499ba0a.png?ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T13:44:49Z", "content": "Jada Pinkett Smith was armed and ready when she felt threatened.

Like most Americans, I would eat myself sick.\n\nBut seven years ago, throat cancer stole my ability to eat. After a 15-hour surgery rooting through arteries and nerves, I was left with a crater in my right temple and an inability to swallow even a sip of water. The doctors surgically installed a permanent feeding tube next to my bellybutton so I could pump liquid protein and receive all of my nutrition. I had survived the surgery and the cancer had been removed, but I was far from OK.\n\nI had never had a complicated relationship with food \u2015 rather, it had been a reciprocal love affair. I relished cooking, entertaining and being served the finest, freshest food available.\n\nThe natural rhythm of my day, from coffee to 5 p.m. wine, suddenly was gone. I was the one who had to shop for and cook for my family, and I longed for the feel of food in my mouth, as well as for the joy of breaking bread with friends and family. Depression blossomed. I lost my sense of humor, and the enthusiasm I\u2019d had for my lucky life as a stay-at-home mom who was married to a great man. I lost all sense of joy.\n\nWe are what we eat, the saying goes, but we are so much more. What we consume, what we choose to think about, affects our souls deeply. It can mean the difference between happiness and suffering.\n\nHolidays were the worst, especially Thanksgiving. All the Thanksgivings I\u2019ve hosted in my wonderful old house have blended together in my memory because my family does the exact same thing every year \u2015 and it\u2019s based on the overabundance of food, stemming from our Italian heritage.\n\nMy first Thanksgiving without being able to eat was disturbing, overwhelming and completely unraveling. The challenge of not eating on a day that has always been focused on food seemed insurmountable. I sulked and stayed in my room for most of the time. I could hear the din of laughter in the dining room, the joy that comes from food and coats the pain and injustice of life. I cried, and then went downstairs to try to show that this giant problem was really no problem at all.\n\nIn the seven years since my stomach tube was put into place, I have listened to many sermons, taken hundreds of yoga classes, studied spiritual awakening books and been in therapy. I\u2019ve learned to try to let go of fear, commit to unconditional happiness, love what is and not be controlling. The message is loud and clear in our contemporary spiritual supermarket: clinging to an idea or having an expectation can kill a moment, or a day or a lifetime.\n\nHowever, implementing those beliefs is not as easy as intellectually understanding the concepts behind them. It takes discipline and meditation and intention. Inspired by my children, I decided to do the work. They needed a real mom, not a zombie mom. I forced myself to climb my way out of a very deep hole and to find a new way of thinking and living.\n\nBut Thanksgiving was still the day I seemed to forget everything I thought I\u2019d learned.\n\nGradually, over the years, I came to realize that I could, in fact, consume other things. I could consume things in my surroundings \u2015 my comfortable home, or intellectually stimulating creative endeavors that fed my mind, like painting or reading a great book. We are what we eat, the saying goes, but we are so much more. What we consume, what we choose to think about, affects our souls deeply. It can mean the difference between happiness and suffering. There is this choice.\n\nThe walls of my favorite holiday tradition began to crumble, and new ones began to be built.\n\nThere is also a physical element of being deprived of eating with my mouth. With every small bite of food or sip of wine, the body releases chemicals that makes us feel good. But feeding the brain with appreciation for sunsets, flowers and friendships \u2015 delicacies for our soul \u2015 produces the same good chemicals. I have come to believe that the diet of my thoughts can and must be selected very, very carefully.\n\nWith my decision made \u2015 and that\u2019s the key, making the decision \u2015 there has been progress. But to conquer the fortress of Thanksgiving, I had to practice for seven years to stop fantasizing about something that wasn\u2019t going to happen. It took training, as for a marathon. Slowly, though, the walls of my favorite holiday tradition began to crumble, and new ones began to be built.\n\nSo last Thanksgiving I decided I was going to have a zero-calorie, zero-resentment version of the old tradition. It would be a spiritual banquet for me.\n\nI began the tradition by remembering that Thanksgiving is not a national holiday founded on food. It\u2019s about gratitude. My family typically has been especially grateful for the appetizers \u2015 fresh ricotta cheese, mozzarella made the day before by an old Italian man who learned from his mother, prosciutto and bread and dried peppers soaked in oil and hot pepper flakes. Things that would be a meal on any other day. But last year, I thought about them with my new focus. I thought about how it was the only time of the entire year where my brother and sister stood around the table in my home to be with my family for two days.\n\nI began the tradition by remembering that Thanksgiving is not a national holiday founded on food. It\u2019s about gratitude.\n\nWhen the appetizer frenzy began early in the day and the long kitchen farm table was loaded with treasures from Arthur Avenue, my loved ones became my treasures.\n\nI was nourished by the fact that I\u2019d brought everyone together. When they were loading up their pieces of bread with fresh ricotta, I loaded up on their joyful energy. My son gave me several warm gravy hugs during the day; my daughter\u2019s personality, as she peppered the day with a few sarcastic comments, made me smile. I drank in the love of my husband like I was slowly sipping a full-bodied Barollo. I was aware my stomach remained empty, but I did not focus on it. Better for me. No one acknowledged my ongoing struggle with food, and I simply stopped feeling mad about that.\n\nMy banquet was all easily digested, no bloating or weight gain. At the end of the day, I felt full in a new way. I had feasted on the joy of sitting with my sister and brother, people I started out my life with and with whom I felt a tribal communion, beings who had inhabited the planet with me for my entire life. Our collective experience was all the nourishment I needed. A silent prayer of gratitude was the dessert.\n\nI\u2019d won the lottery, beaten impossible odds, and I still got to be here to see and feel it all. That was grace, no matter what I thought my life should be. And this is exactly how I plan to enjoy my Thanksgiving this year: full of gratitude."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Kevin Robillard", "title": "Rep.

He upset an incumbent accused of corruption in a Democratic primary in 2014 while downplaying his heroics as a Marine in Iraq. His support from top military officials \u2015 he served as an aide to former Gen. David Petraeus \u2015 and willingness to buck his own\u2019s party\u2019s leadership made him the subject of national magazine profiles and 2020 presidential speculation. He was the very image of a Democratic rising star.\n\nNow, as that willingness to criticize top Democratic officials reaches its peak with his leadership of a coup against likely House Speaker-in-waiting Nancy Pelosi, Moulton is feeling the backlash. At a town hall in his district on Massachusetts\u2019 North Shore on Monday night, activists confronted Moulton with accusations of sexism and ageism, mirroring the assault he\u2019s facing from Pelosi allies in Washington.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m totally pissed off,\u201d said Linda Christian, 80, a retired lawyer who sharply questioned Moulton at the event. \u201cI voted for him. I like this man. I think he\u2019s shown, if not animus, stupidity.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe feels women are disposable, and elderly people are disposable,\u201d she continued.\n\nMoulton said sticking with the party\u2019s core House leadership \u2015 including the 78-year-old Pelosi and Reps. Steny Hoyer, 79, and James Clyburn, 78 \u2015 would be ignoring the lessons of the Democratic wave in the 2018 midterm elections, at least as he understands them.\n\n\u201cThe American people cried out for change in this election,\u201d Moulton said at the town hall, referencing the LGBTQ people, military veterans and people of color who won seats in the House this month. \u201cI think if our party answers that call for change with the same status quo leadership team we\u2019ve had in place since 2006, we\u2019re failing the American people.\u201d\n\nBoston Globe via Getty Images Activists supporting Nancy Pelosi's bid for speaker of the House are causing problems back home for Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts.\n\nNot all of the more than 100 constituents who filled this 17,000-person city\u2019s town hall were there to lambast Moulton. A roughly equal number expressed support for his stance against Pelosi\u2019s continued leadership of House Democrats. But the hourlong event focused almost exclusively on the speakership battle \u2015 a lone question from a city council member about sewage overflow notwithstanding \u2015 and the fracas shows the political risk of Moulton\u2019s decision to lead the anti-Pelosi forces. Activists in his district and operatives across the country who once supported him are now talking of recruiting a primary challenger to him in 2020.\n\n\u201cIf we could do a CrowdPac for Susan Collins\u2019 challenger, why couldn\u2019t we do one for a challenger to him?\u201d asked Bambi Snodgrass, who helped organize the pro-Pelosi protest and said she had knocked on more than 1,000 doors for Moulton\u2019s campaigns.\n\nMoulton and the other Democratic rebels opposing Pelosi on Monday released a letter with 16 signatories pledging to oppose their party\u2019s leader both in the Democratic caucus vote and on the floor of the House. Roughly nine other Democrats \u2015 many of them military vets who unseated GOP incumbents with Moulton\u2019s support \u2015 have also said they wouldn\u2019t support her. The exact size of the Democratic caucus is still uncertain, but there\u2019s likely enough opposition to cause problems for Pelosi.\n\nWhile grassroots conservative activists largely backed tea party and House Freedom Caucus challenges to John Boehner\u2019s leadership, grassroots progressives like Snodgrass and the other protesters seem more likely to back the Democratic Party\u2019s established leadership. Indivisible, the network of local progressive groups that has played a major role in encouraging and organizing Democratic energy during the Trump era, endorsed Pelosi for speaker last week. That\u2019s a potential problem for Moulton and the other rebels, who largely hail from the center of the political spectrum. Just two of the anti-Pelosi letter\u2019s signatories are members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\nThe Democratic Party appears split on the Pelosi question. A CBS News poll released on Monday night found 49 percent of Democrats want Pelosi to continue as speaker, 40 percent would prefer another Democrat and 10 percent are undecided.\n\nThe divide was visible in Amesbury.\n\n\u201cThe implication, that just because I\u2019m a white man, that I\u2019m being sexist just because I\u2019m opposed to 16 years of two people basically running the Democratic side of Congress, I resent that,\u201d one man said at the town hall.\n\nPelosi, meanwhile, has steadfastly insisted she feels no threat from the second-term Moulton and his allies, including Ohio Reps. Tim Ryan and Marcia Fudge. \u201cI will be speaker of the House no matter what Seth Moulton says,\u201d she boasted last week.\n\nDemocratic sources said Pelosi\u2019s team has dispatched California Rep. Ted Lieu, a veteran and Pelosi ally, to lobby the freshmen military veterans who Moulton helped recruit, including Reps.-elect Jason Crow of Colorado and Jared Golden of Maine.\n\nMoulton expressed confidence the newly elected members would keep their campaign trail promise not to back Pelosi, and predicted a quiet plurality of the Democratic caucus would prevent her from rising to a second stint as speaker."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Lee Moran", "title": "\u2018Morning Joe\u2019 Supercut Nails Utter Hypocrisy Of Ivanka Trump\u2019s Emails", "description": "\u201cThis is the same Ivanka Trump who is related to Donald Trump?\" asked host Joe Scarborough.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ivanka-trump-email-morning-joe-supercut_us_5bf3f7b8e4b0376c9e68a5ad", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf3fc411f0000060626383c.jpeg?cache=5UONq8CY40&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T13:20:51Z", "content": "\u201c Morning Joe \u201d hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski cut to the chase in dissecting White House adviser Ivanka Trump\u2019s reported use of personal email for government business.

He claimed in February that drug testing \u201cbenefits the unemployed by helping to assure future employers that unemployment claimants ... are truly able and available for work.\u201d\n\nRight before Election Day, while most Americans were distracted by whether a blue wave was going to engulf Congress, the Trump administration moved to place yet another obstacle between the needy and one of the programs that they rely on to get by. The policy change is supposedly about helping people become work ready, but in reality, it\u2019s about stigmatizing the assistance they need.\n\nIf adopted, the Department of Labor\u2019s proposed rule would let states impose a drug test on people who lose their jobs and need unemployment insurance to get through the dry spell.\n\nThe rule will now undergo a comment period before it can take effect. If it does, it will be the first time states are allowed to force virtually any jobless residents to pee in a cup in return for their unemployment checks. This would fulfill a longtime GOP wish. After a compromise in 2012, Congress allowed states to impose drug tests only for those who lost their jobs because of a positive result or were searching for jobs in workplaces where tests are legally required. Republicans argued then this was far too restrictive, and they may now get want they originally wanted.\n\nUnemployment isn\u2019t the only program that might soon be subject to drug tests. This year The Associated Press reported that the administration was mulling a proposal to let states drug test certain food stamp recipients \u2015 even though the Department of Agriculture has repeatedly made it clear that letting states do that would violate current law.\n\nThe policy change is supposedly about helping people become work ready, but in reality, it\u2019s about stigmatizing the assistance they need.\n\nThe idea behind these tests, at least on the surface, is to help people solve a problem that can prevent them from holding down a job: substance abuse. Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) called drug testing in unemployment insurance an \u201cimportant reform to help qualified unemployed workers in their quest to find a new job,\u201d and Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) claimed it \u201cbenefits the unemployed by helping to assure future employers that unemployment claimants re-entering the workforce are truly able and available for work.\u201d\n\nBut for that to be true, the drug tests would have to be designed to identify people with addictions and connect them with treatment and other help, to get them on the road to recovery and eventually back to work. That\u2019s not how drug testing for public benefits has operated so far. Instead, it has become one more in a series of blockades Republicans have erected between poor people and the help they need, one that comes coupled with a healthy dose of shame.\n\nUntil the 2012 compromise, the only program in which states could impose drug tests was Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or cash welfare. The experience is instructive. Over the past four years, states have drug tested a share of the population that gets TANF benefits and come back with a minuscule number of positive results. In some years, some states have uncovered exactly zero drug users. For all that, they\u2019ve spent millions of dollars to administer the tests \u2014 money that could otherwise go to poor people.\n\nThere is no guarantee that a positive result gets someone in treatment. In Arkansas, for example, zero people who tested positive ended up receiving drug rehabilitation assistance. Worse, people fail to take a test or refuse to do so and lose their benefits.\n\nAnd that gets at the real purpose of the tests: deterring people from applying for public benefits. When people lose benefits because they didn\u2019t take a test, states aren\u2019t going to offer them any extra help or treatment to kick a possible drug problem. Those people simply fall through a crack and disappear. They will be left worse off financially and in no better shape to find a job if they needed help getting one.\n\nThe real purpose of the tests: deterring people from applying for public benefits.\n\nIf we really want to help people who may be struggling with addiction or substance abuse, taking away resources is a poor way to go about it. Giving someone a financial bridge and food to eat can help them stabilize their lives, which makes it far easier to seek treatment, if that\u2019s what they need. Without those stabilizers, it becomes more likely that they may face homelessness, hunger and hardship, all of which make getting clean and getting back to work far more difficult.\n\nWhat drug tests are really about, then, is stigmatizing the poor and the benefits they rely on. Insisting that we need to impose a drug test to be eligible for unemployment benefits or food stamps implies that there is a contagion of drug addiction among recipients that has to be rooted out. But in reality, poor people aren\u2019t using drugs at vastly higher rates than others. Research has found that drug use rates among those who receive public benefits are the same as or only slightly higher than in the general population. That\u2019s true of food stamp recipients, who aren\u2019t much more likely to have drug dependence problems than everyone else.\n\nIt\u2019s already often humbling, if not humiliating, to have to ask for government assistance to make sure you and your family are healthy, fed and safe. If one of the conditions of getting the assistance is peeing in a cup, many people may decide it\u2019s not worth the bother, that they won\u2019t let themselves be subject to such an ordeal. This punitive measure simply pushes people away.\n\nThat\u2019s almost certainly the real aim of these new rules. Coupled with other recent changes to public programs \u2014 imposing work requirements, for example, and cutting and restructuring agencies in ways that threaten their very existence while trying to claim that poverty isn\u2019t actually a problem in this country \u2014 the Trump administration has made it pretty clear that it would rather not extend an open hand to this country\u2019s poor. It has made enrolling not just more complicated but more demeaning. If states get the green light to impose drug tests on a bunch of new programs, it will be one more way of vilifying the safety net while keeping it even farther out of reach."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Willa Frej", "title": "Clapper Calls Trump\u2019s Bin Laden Criticism A \u2018Slam At The Intelligence Community\u2019", "description": "The president thinks retired Navy Adm.

And in the age of the Me Too and Time\u2019s Up movements, one fundamental lesson is the importance of our bodies and bodily autonomy.\n\n\u201cBody awareness talks are the earliest conversations parents can have with young children to support their health and safety,\u201d sex educator Melissa Carnagey said. Conversations about body parts and bodily autonomy lay the foundation for understanding consent and sexual misconduct.\n\nTo inform these early discussions, HuffPost spoke to Carnagey and sex educator Lydia M. Bowers about the best ways to explore the topic of private parts and bodily autonomy with young kids.\n\nHere are their expert-backed guidelines and tips for parents and caregivers to keep in mind.\n\nUse The Proper Terms For Body Parts\n\n\u201cBody parts are body parts are body parts,\u201d Bowers said, emphasizing that \u201cpenis,\u201d \u201ctesticles,\u201d \u201cvulva\u201d and \u201cvagina\u201d are not bad words. Parents should become comfortable using these terms or the corresponding words if they speak a language other than English at home.\n\n\u201cOften without hesitation, caregivers will use accurate terms for body parts like elbow, knee and nose, so parts like the penis, vulva, vagina and anus should be no different,\u201d said Carnagey.\n\nThere are several reasons children should learn the proper terms for private parts instead of nicknames. One is that having the right language and context helps kids communicate clearly about their bodies. This is important in the context of telling a doctor or caregiver where something hurts or itches.\n\n\u201cWhen we avoid saying words, we instill a sense of shame, of something to be avoided or hidden.\u201d - Lydia M. Bowers, sex educator\n\n\u201cUsing accurate terms also better prepares them to talk confidently about changes they may experience to their body as they grow, especially to medical providers or in settings where they may be learning about their health,\u201d Carnagey added.\n\n\u201cWhen we avoid saying words, we instill a sense of shame, of something to be avoided or hidden,\u201d Bowers said. She added that using the correct terms is useful in teaching kids how to keep their bodies clean and healthy. \u201cFor proper hygiene, there\u2019s a difference in how the bottom or the penis or the vulva are wiped and washed.\u201d\n\nAvoid Cutesy Language\n\nAlthough it is tempting to use euphemisms and cutesy language when talking to little kids about their bodies, this can lead to problems.\n\n\u201cOne issue is that there are so many alternate terms and many of them have other meanings. This can be risky because it can lead to a child being misunderstood by others, especially if they have experienced unsafe touch to that part of their body and need to report it,\u201d said Carnagey.\n\nKids should be able to identify body parts as private and correctly name them so that they can communicate if they\u2019ve been touched inappropriately.\n\n\u201cWe sometimes give nicknames for body parts \u2015 like \u2018piggies\u2019 and \u2018noggin.\u2019 But just like we also teach children those parts are actually called \u2018toes\u2019 and \u2018head,\u2019 they need to know real private-part terms as well,\u201d Bowers explained. \u201cIf we\u2019re using cutesy names because we\u2019re embarrassed or ashamed to say the actual terms, we\u2019re perpetuating the idea that some body parts are dirty, bad or shameful.\u201d\n\nPromote Bodily Autonomy In Everyday Situations\n\n\u201cCreating a home culture where everyone\u2019s body boundaries are respected is an important step,\u201d Carnagey said. Parents can do this by not forcing their kids to share affection with others and by getting in the habit of asking for touch \u2015 for example, saying \u201cMay I give you a hug?\u201d rather than \u201cGive me a hug.\u201d\n\nCarnagey advised that parents not dismiss unwanted touch between siblings or family members as play.\n\n\u201cIn our home, for example, we have an agreement that no one should have to repeat \u2018no\u2019 or \u2018stop\u2019 before the boundary is respected,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt may take some reminding and redirecting at first, but when it\u2019s consistently practiced, children become more mindful of the boundaries of others and come to expect theirs to be respected as well.\u201d\n\nParents and caregivers can promote bodily autonomy in everyday circumstances like mealtimes. \u201cWhen a child says that they are full or finished eating, avoiding a power struggle by not forcing them to take one more bite or finish their plate honors what their body is telling them,\u201d said Carnagey.\n\nBowers pointed out that there are opportunities to teach these lessons while reading books or watching movies. Parents can say things like, \u201cShould that prince have kissed the princess when she was sleeping? She wasn\u2019t able to say yes or no.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, there are times that parents should not insist on asking for permission, however, like when changing diapers, taking kids to the doctor to receive medical care and bathing young children before they\u2019re able to do it on their own.\n\n\u201cIf we ask a child, \u2018May I change your diaper?\u2019 and they respond with \u2018no,\u2019 we\u2019re left with two options. Either we violate their consent or we leave them in a dirty diaper, which is a health and safety hazard,\u201d she explained. \u201cInstead, we talk through with them. \u2018It\u2019s time to change your diaper. Your body did its job to get that out, and now we\u2019re going to take off the dirty diaper. I\u2019m going to use this wipe. \u2026\u2019 We can still show them that their body is worth respect, that we will be intentional and inform of the process.\u201d\n\nUse Books And Videos\n\nEducate to Empower Publishing Many children\u2019s books \u2014 for example, Jayneen Sanders\u2019 My Body! What I Say Goes! \u2014 promote themes of bodily autonomy and safety.\n\nEducate2Empower Publishing, Sanders\u2019 publisher, is a great resource for families because it is an imprint specializing in children\u2019s books on body safety, consent, gender equality, respectful relationships and social and emotional intelligence.\n\nCarnagey\u2019s Sex Positive Families website features a reading list of over 100 books on sexual health for children and families, including many that tackle consent and bodily autonomy.\n\nBeyond books, the Animated Child, an enrichment center in Virginia, offers a video version of My Body! What I Say Goes! and others on consent and safety. Amaze produces useful videos to inform these kinds of conversations as well.\n\nTeach Kids To Trust Their Instincts\n\nThere are ways to help kids learn to trust their instincts, which can be a fundamental step in teaching bodily autonomy and contextualizing difficult experiences.\n\n\u201cBeing in the habit of checking in and making space to hear from them how they are doing in a moment is a great way to help increase their body awareness and language around their experiences.\u201d - Melissa Carnagey, sex educator\n\nCarnagey suggested teaching kids to identify their feelings. Parents and caregivers can do this by asking questions like \u201cHow are you feeling right now?\u201d or pointing out when they notice shifts in body language with statements like \u201cI see that you\u2019re frowning. Tell me what you\u2019re feeling.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Peter Yeung", "title": "What Life Is Like In Hong Kong, The Most Expensive City To Live In The World", "description": "People are sleeping in \"coffin\" apartments, illegal shacks and McDonald\u2019s restaurants.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hong-kong-most-expensive-city-housing_us_5beeb701e4b0860184a79215", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5beeee1d1d0000e2013132f9.jpeg?cache=4rtjci9z27&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T10:45:13Z", "content": "As she did every day, a 56-year-old homeless woman with short black hair and black-rimmed glasses, named by police simply as Lai, walked into her local 24-hour McDonalds in Hong Kong and took a seat at a booth.

Lai was pronounced dead at the scene. At 11:30 the next morning, her body was taken out through a back door. By 1 p.m., the McDonald\u2019s was back open for business as usual.\n\nLai was one of Hong Kong\u2019s McRefugees: those seeking shelter in 24-hour fast-food joints in a city where finding somewhere to live can be a serious challenge. For the last eight years, U.S. planning consultancy Demographia has ranked Hong Kong the most expensive city in the world to live in on a scale calculated by dividing the median house price by the median household income.\n\nIn Hong Kong, property costs 19.4 times the average household income. Compare that with 9.4 times in Los Angeles and 9.1 times in San Francisco \u2015 cities infamous for their housing crises \u2015 and the extent of the problem becomes apparent.\n\nTyrone Siu / Reuters One of Hong Kong's McRefugees sleeps at a 24-hour McDonald's with an alarm clock nearby to wake him up.\n\nA Stark Divide\n\nWhen it comes to housing, Hong Kong is a land of extremes. At one end is the opulence \u2015 the average price of property had reached almost $3,200 per square foot by February, and a four-bedroom house recently sold for $177 million. Since 2003, home prices have risen 430 percent. Renting is also exorbitant. Almost half of the city\u2019s apartments cost more than $2,550 a month, according to a report by Hong Kong real estate agency Midland Realty, which is 122 percent of the average individual\u2019s salary.\n\n\u201cHong Kong only builds for the rich. They need to care for real people,\u201d says Chan To, 30, a skinny man with flecks of gray in his hair who has been homeless since he lost his job as a chef last summer. Like Lai, Chan sought refuge in McDonald\u2019s, sleeping in various outlets every night for the last four months, he says.\n\nIt\u2019s not just fast-food restaurants that provide precarious shelter. Hong Kong\u2019s vulnerable communities have been forced to resort to footbridges over busy, polluted roads, illegal shacks and the infamous \u201ccoffin cubicles,\u201d where dozens of residents might be crammed into minuscule rooms also known as \u201ccage homes.\u201d Meanwhile, more than 200,000 Hong Kongers now live in subdivided apartments, former single flats split into several smaller ones with shared facilities, according to official statistics.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Cheung Chi-fong, 80, sleeps in his tiny \"coffin cubicle,\" where he cannot stretch out his legs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so uncomfortable,\u201d says Laurie, a single mother who has lived in a subdivided unit with her 9-year-old daughter for two years. They have no private bathroom or kitchen.\n\nLaurie, who asked to withhold her full name, works as a cleaner in a hotel and lives in an eighth-floor walk-up in the Mong Kok neighborhood. She earns $1,400 a month, more than a third of which goes toward rent. The kitchen is often packed with large families, and she had to buy her own refrigerator because the landlord refused. \u201cSome people shout loudly, and so we can\u2019t sleep well,\u201d she says. \u201cMy girl always asks me when we are going to leave. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nA significant number of these subdivided apartments are in breach of safety regulations, says Yip Ngai-ming, a professor of housing and urban studies at the City University of Hong Kong. \u201cThey have been converted for a use that they weren\u2019t designed for. The way they\u2019ve been divided, fire doors aren\u2019t in the proper place. Lots of it is being done illegally.\u201d\n\nThe deadly nature of the problem was underlined last year when a fire that started in a subdivided unit, one of 17 on the same floor, spread through a building and killed three people.\n\nSolving The Housing Shortage\n\nFor many, more public housing is central to resolving Hong Kong\u2019s problem.\n\n\u201c[The government] must build more public housing,\u201d Wong Shek Hung, the Hong Kong manager for Oxfam, tells HuffPost. \u201cRight now, the supply is limited. Families are waiting too long to be housed. ... I have witnessed some cases of people living in public toilets \u2015 and even some in the airports.\u201d\n\nSociety for Community Organization A young family in one of many poorly maintained subdivided apartments in Hong Kong. The average wait for public housing is 5.5 years.\n\nHong Kong has approximately 815,000 public rental homes and the average wait for general applicants is 5.5 years. The government has committed to building a further 280,000 public apartments by 2027 but has admitted it\u2019s likely to miss its target by tens of thousands of units.\n\nLast year, the government appointed a panel of housing experts from disciplines including planning, engineering, architecture and social services to consider ways to meet housing needs in Hong Kong. The panel has explored a range of potential options, from developing brownfield sites to creating underground caverns. Its report is due in the coming months.\n\nOne of the most radical ideas, however, was put forward separately last month by Carrie Lam, head of the Hong Kong government. Lam has proposed building artificial islands covering approximately 1,700 hectares (4,200 acres) to house up to 1.1 million people to the east of Lantau Island, the largest of Hong Kong\u2019s islands. The aim is to create 260,000 to 400,000 residential homes, 70 percent of which would be for public housing, according to government statistics.\n\nOur Hong Kong Foundation Rendering of Carrie Lam's proposed artificial islands plan.\n\nBut the plans won\u2019t tackle the imminent housing problem, says Brian Wong of the Liber Research Community, an independent nongovernmental organization focused on land and development research. Reclaiming land from the sea is expensive, environmentally destructive and could take decades to be completed, he says.\n\nIn the shorter term, some believe that rent controls could help relieve the pressure on the overheated market. \u201cThe supply has shifted towards the private market, without any control on rent, which has been rocketing,\u201d says Angela Lui, a social worker at the homelessness charity Society for Community Organisation. \u201cIt\u2019s become crazy. This might not solve the underlying problems with public housing, but it would certainly improve a lot of lives.\u201d\n\nFor now, people like Chan must wait in the hope that the government implements a solution that will provide some genuine help soon. Every morning, Chan is woken up by McDonald\u2019s staff at 7 a.m. before visiting a public library to read newspapers and search for jobs. On better days, a local church provides a free meal. Other times, he\u2019s forced to eat leftovers discarded by diners.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so embarrassed when people look at me,\u201d he says.\n\nFor more content and to be part of the \u201cThis New World\u201d community, follow our Facebook page."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Michael Hobbes", "title": "The 2018 Midterms Were A Preview Of 2020\u2032s Policy Ideas", "description": "What the wins and losses of this year\u2019s ballot measures mean for the political debates of the future.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-2018-midterms-were-a-preview-of-the-policy-ideas-of-2020_us_5bf343a1e4b0376c9e67ef28", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf344eb240000300499b9e9.jpeg?cache=Oaic9xWybx&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T10:45:13Z", "content": "America is a big and complicated country in which elections rarely provide straightforward narratives.

This month\u2019s midterm elections were the simultaneous story of booming turnout and suppressed votes, a blue wave among women and a red shift among white men.\n\nBallot initiatives, the country\u2019s laboratory for policy ideas, are even harder to transform into simple lessons or clear takeaways.\n\nVoters in California, for example, banned animal cruelty and preserved a gas tax increase, while at the same time rejecting rent control and declining to cap the profits of dialysis companies. In Florida, voters approved stunningly progressive environmental and voting rights reforms alongside stunningly regressive taxation and tough-on-crime laws. Culture war battlegrounds \u2015 including trans rights, gun control and police violence \u2015 somehow became technocratic ballot measures that attracted little controversy and bipartisan support.\n\nThey are also glimpses into the future. From content to messaging to funding, the 2018 midterms offer a preview of the policies \u2014 and the debates accompanying them \u2014 that are likely to dominate the 2020 campaign.\n\nSpencer Platt via Getty Images Ohio leads the nation in drug overdoses. Issue 1, which voters rejected by a wide margin, would have downgraded drug possession to a misdemeanor and invested more funding in treatment programs.\n\nBig Ideas and Comprehensive Reforms\n\nOhio\u2019s Issue 1 was going to overhaul the entire criminal justice system at once. First, the measure would have downgraded simple drug possession from a felony to a misdemeanor, capping the maximum penalty at six months of jail time. Second, it would have prevented courts from imposing prison sentences for probation violations. Third, the money it saved by reducing incarceration rates would have been poured into to drug treatment and rehabilitation programs.\n\nIt was stunningly ambitious, a constitutional amendment that would have transformed crime classification, sentencing and budgeting at the same time.\n\nIt was also, it turns out, too much for Ohio voters. The measure lost by nearly 30 percentage points.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a blue wave here,\u201d said Dennis Willard, the communications director for the Yes on Issue 1 campaign.\n\nStill, the initiative offers a model that can be replicated in other states. And its loss provides a guide to the likely political opposition the proposals must overcome.\n\nOne of the reasons for Issue 1\u2032s loss, Willard said, was the coalition of judges, prosecutors and sheriffs that formed against it. The initiatives drug sentencing provisions also became linked to the governor\u2019s race, with entire segments of campaign debates dedicated to arguing over their implications for Ohio\u2019s opioid epidemic. Both of these hurdles could be better anticipated and addressed by the campaigns for similar measures in other states.\n\nOther defeated ballot initiatives also simply might fare better in other states. Maine, for example, proposed a tax on high earners to support universal home health care for the elderly and persons with disabilities. Nevada tried to end its state energy monopoly. Oklahoma attempted to dedicate its oil and gas revenues to a \u201cstabilization fund\u201d that would have been helped smooth out government spending in the next recession.\n\nThis blueprint \u2015 if at first you don\u2019t succeed, find a friendlier political environment \u2015 has already blazed a path for dozens of other policy ideas over the years. Automatic voter registration, for example, began with a single campaign in Oregon. Minimum wage hikes and medical marijuana initiatives began as pilot ideas in a few cities, then expanded to entire states.\n\nTurnout in 2020 is likely to be high, with the dynamics of 2018 even more amplified. As they look ahead, campaigners see perfect conditions for testing out big ideas and making second attempts at ones that have already been floated. Willard points out that only five states have reclassified drug possession as a misdemeanor since 2014. The attempt in Ohio has created a sense of urgency and possibility for other states to try the same idea again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like moving a glacier,\u201d Willard said. \u201cThe status quo is the status quo because it provides the greatest amount of comfort to people in power. So when you\u2019re fighting to change it, you\u2019re fighting the power structure.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why, he said, \u201cYou have to be willing to fight even if you know you might not win this time.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Grassroots campaigns weren't enough for Washington state's Initiative 1631, which would have imposed a tax on carbon. After a well-funded campaign funded by oil and gas companies, the initiative lost decisively.\n\nMore Aggressive Actions By Corporations\n\nCorporations did not get everything they wanted in midterms, but they got pretty close.\n\nOil and gas companies spent $31 million to crush Washington state\u2019s (second) attempt at a carbon tax. In California, dialysis companies poured $111 million into killing a measure that would have capped their profits at 15 percent. Efforts to protect groundwater from mining companies (Montana) and salmon from extractive drilling (Alaska) went down in flames following well-funded corporate campaigns. In perhaps the night\u2019s most brazen victory, a Disney-led coalition of casino owners in Florida managed to make competition in their sector illegal altogether.\n\nThis, too, is a glimpse of things to come. While corporations often tout their charitable contributions and claim that they\u2019re willing to work with lawmakers to address pollution, homelessness or health issues, their actions demonstrate that they will battle any effort to make these contributions mandatory.\n\nEarlier this year in Seattle, Amazon and Starbucks led a successful campaign to repeal a tax on corporations that would have funded homeless services. In California, beverage companies retaliated against municipal soda taxes by sponsoring a ballot measure that would have required a two-thirds majority to raise any local taxes. If legislators hadn\u2019t bargained to keep it off the ballot, the measure could have threatened local funding for libraries, parks, police and fire departments.\n\nTogether, the message these efforts sent is chilling: Corporations are willing to sacrifice the public interest for their own. And in the future, they\u2019re only going to get more aggressive in doing so.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS A Reconstruction-era law that allowed split jury verdicts was overturned in Louisiana. The campaign attracted bipartisan support.\n\nVoters Will (Sometimes) Support Initiatives That Cut Against Their Political Grain\n\nOne of the most notable wins for progressives in the midterms was Washington state\u2019s \u201cde-escalation\u201d initiative. Under the new law, police officers will receive mandatory training on how to handle suspects non-violently and constructively engage with citizens suffering from mental illness. The measure, which takes its inspiration from the Black Lives Matter movement and was promoted by family members of police violence victims, also updates the law to make it easier to prosecute law enforcement officers for wrongful deaths.\n\nBut the most notable thing about the measure is not its structure or content. It\u2019s that it passed with nearly 60 percent of the vote. Washington may have a reputation as a blue state, but it includes large rural and suburban populations. Many of the same voters who approved the police violence ballot measure also cast ballots to empower Republican legislators and decisively rejected a carbon tax.\n\nSo, in a country where 65 percent of conservative voters oppose the Black Lives Matter movement, how did a ballot measure so clearly inspired by it win bipartisan support?\n\nJack Sorensen, a spokesman for De-Escalate Washington, said the campaign deliberately tried to deliver a unifying message, highlighting the initiative\u2019s support among police officers and its relevance in rural areas, where several police killings had taken place. When the Spokesman-Review, a newspaper in deep-red Eastern Washington, wrote an editorial opposing the measure, Sorensen worked with a retired local law enforcement official to write an Op-Ed supporting it.\n\nThe measure\u2019s campaign also got lucky. Though the measure attracted opposition from some police unions and other law enforcement groups, none were bankrolled by billionaire donors or corporate interests. Unlike the state\u2019s carbon tax initiative, voters received information about the police de-escalation measure that was proportionate to its impacts and accurate about its effects.\n\nSo it was with many of the other cross-aisle ballot initiatives that won on election night. Victorious medical marijuana and Medicaid expansion measures didn\u2019t attract deep-pocketed opposition. Right-wing donors didn\u2019t coalesce around voting-rights expansions. Florida\u2019s felon re-enfranchisement initiative was supported by everyone from John Legend to the Koch brothers.\n\nIn a country where the channels for misinformation are proliferating and where a significant plurality believes in conspiracy theories, the greatest challenge for campaigners may be keeping their issues out of the headlines long enough for voters to make up their own minds.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Florida's Initiative 4 restored voting rights to 1.5 million felons.\n\nBlue States Keep Expanding Voting Rights, Red States Keep Clamping Down\n\nOn the surface, 2018 was a great year for voting rights and election regulations. Florida re-enfranchised 1.5 million felons. Colorado, Missouri and Ohio restricted gerrymandering. Maryland adopted Election Day voter registration and Nevada made it automatic. Michigan approved a comprehensive voting-rights measure that included no-excuse absentee ballots.\n\nDig a little deeper, though, and you find the opposite trend holds true, too. Voter ID laws passed in North Carolina and Arkansas, backed by nearly 80 percent of voters in the latter state. North Dakota approved a symbolic measure stipulating that all voters must be citizens. Montana passed a bizarre ballot initiative restricting voters from handling each others\u2019 ballots. All these measures are attempts to crack down on \u201cvoter fraud,\u201d an idea that has captured the Republican imagination despite no evidence that it\u2019s a systematic problem.\n\nBetween the platitudes of a voting-rights resurgence and a crackdown, what America appears to be experiencing is a bifurcation. In blue states, lawmakers are easing registration provisions and expanding the times and methods of voting. The first legislative project for the newly minted House Democratic majority may well be a nationwide law making it easier to vote.\n\nBut these policies are themselves a reaction to a countervailing and ongoing trend among GOP legislators. Between 2010 and 2018, 24 states passed restrictions on voting rights. The midterm elections were marred by long lines at voting machines, court battles and brazen attempts to disenfranchise the poor and people of color.\n\nThis divide is only going to get worse. Just as the current wave of voting rights legislation is a reaction to GOP attempts to curtail it, red states will likely resist, obstruct or find new workarounds to Democratic efforts to expand the franchise. While the Florida felon re-enfranchisement measure passed with broad support, other voting-rights expansions have lost in the face of nationally coordinated, well-funded opposition campaigns.\n\nDemocrats watched the midterm elections and heard a call to expand voting rights. Republicans, and their donors, may have heard a call to restrict them."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Dominique Mosbergen", "title": "Stacey Abrams: Georgia Gubernatorial Election Was Neither Fair Nor Free", "description": "The former Democratic nominee for governor has vowed to fight voter suppression in her state.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stacey-abrams-georgia-election-not-free-fair_us_5bf3c11be4b0d9e7283c9c31", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf3d66a1f0000d205263828.png?cache=ugoppdgoz0&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T10:36:46Z", "content": "Georgias hotly contested election for governor was neither fair nor free, former Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams said in a Monday night interview.

[And] she became very emotional.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was in tears, she was crying, visibly shaking because she realized what they were saying \u2014 and that is that she had been being used by D\u2019Amico and by Bobbitt. She had been set up,\u201d Gerrow said.\n\nMcClure, 28, D\u2019Amico, 39, and Bobbitt, 34, are facing charges of theft by deception. If convicted, each faces up to 10 years in prison.\n\nProsecutors said the trio concocted a story about Bobbitt giving his last $20 to McClure after she ran out of gas on the I-95 outside of Philadelphia. The story was shared \u2015 and promptly went viral \u2015 via a GoFundMe campaign launched last year under McClure\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cI wish that I could do more for this selfless man, who went out of his way just to help me that day,\u201d the campaign description read.\n\nSome 14,000 people ended up donating to the campaign; more than $400,000 was ultimately raised.\n\nBurlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina said earlier this month that the trio would\u2019ve likely made off scot-free with the money had Bobbitt not sued McClure and D\u2019Amico for mishandling the funds. Bobbitt claimed in his August lawsuit that he\u2019d only received a fraction of the money raised. He accused the couple of spending a large portion of the funds on gambling, traveling, shopping sprees and a BMW.\n\nIt was only when authorities looked into Bobbitt\u2019s claims that the trio\u2019s alleged swindle was uncovered. Prosecutors said a text message that McClure had sent to a friend had led to their downfall. In the text, McClure allegedly admitted that the GoFundMe story was \u201ccompletely made up.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS This November 2018 combination photo provided by the Burlington County Prosecutors office shows Johnny Bobbitt (left), Kate McClure (center) and Mark D'Amico (right).\n\nGerrow, McClure\u2019s attorney, has acknowledged that his client was involved in spreading the false story about Bobbitt. He claims, however, she was \u201cfed\u201d the story by D\u2019Amico and had only agreed to go along with the plot out of a genuine desire to help Bobbitt, who \u2015 and this is one of the few elements of the story that is true \u2015 was homeless and had served in the Marine Corps.\n\nThe story about the gas money was \u201cpuffing\u201d on McClure\u2019s part, an \u201cexaggeration trying to help this veteran,\u201d Gerrow told ABC News. He added that the GoFundMe campaign \u201cjust took off\u201d in a way McClure had not expected.\n\nIt was Bobbitt and D\u2019Amico, Gerrow claimed, who then took the scam to the next level. He told the Burlington County Times over the weekend that the men had conspired together to \u201cuse\u201d McClure to raise funds that would \u201cfeed Bobbitt\u2019s heroin addiction and D\u2019Amico\u2019s compulsive gambling.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey needed her for the story. But there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that Bobbitt and D\u2019Amico were the ones who invented it,\u201d Gerrow said.\n\nOn Monday, the attorney shared an unverified recording with Good America America that he claimed proves McClure had been duped into participating in the plot. Gerrow said his client had secretly recorded a heated exchange with D\u2019Amico in the wake of Bobbitt\u2019s lawsuit.\n\n\u201cYou started the whole fucking thing. You did everything. I had no part in any of this, and I\u2019m the one taking the fucking fall,\u201d a woman identified by Gerrow as McClure says in the recording.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t go to jail for lying on TV, you dumb fuck,\u201d a man, allegedly D\u2019Amico, replies.\n\n\u201cBut who made me lie on TV?\u201d the woman says.\n\n\u201cWho cares?\u201d the man snaps back.\n\nA twist in the #GoFundMe scheme involving a New Jersey couple & a homeless man.

Mycoskie told HuffPost that he conceived of the idea after receiving a call from his wife, Heather Lang, who was at their home near Thousand Oaks.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018I\u2019m not dropping our son off at school this morning, and I don\u2019t know if I ever will.

Tigar issued a temporary restraining order after hearing arguments in San Francisco. The request was made by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights, which quickly sued after President Donald Trump issued the ban this month in response to the caravans of migrants that have started to arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump issued a proclamation on Nov. 9 that said anyone who crossed the southern border would be ineligible for asylum. The regulations, which will remain in place for three months absent a court order, could potentially make it harder for thousands of people who enter the U.S. to avoid deportation.\n\n\u201cIndividuals are entitled to asylum if they cross between ports of entry,\u201d said Baher Azmy, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be clearer.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, tens of thousands of immigrants each year have shown up in the Arizona desert or on the north bank of the Rio Grande in Texas, surrendered to immigration agents and requested asylum. The Department of Homeland Security estimates around 70,000 people a year claim asylum between official ports of entry.\n\nTrump has argued that the recent caravans are a threat to national security.\n\nAround 3,000 people from the first of the caravans have arrived in Tijuana, Mexico, across the border from San Diego, California. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Monday that it closed off northbound traffic for several hours at the San Ysidro crossing. It has also installed movable, wire-topped barriers, apparently to stop a potential mass rush of people.\n\nAs of Monday, 107 people detained between official crossings have sought asylum since Trump\u2019s order went into effect, according to DHS, which oversees Customs and Border Protection. Officials didn\u2019t say whether those people\u2019s cases were still progressing through other avenues left to them after the proclamation.\n\nDHS has said it wants asylum seekers at the southern border to appear at an official border crossing. But many border crossings such as San Ysidro already have long wait times. People are often forced to wait in shelters or outdoor campson the Mexican side, sometimes for weeks.\n\nACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said that some people seeking asylum cross between official ports because \u201cthey\u2019re in real danger,\u201d either in their countries of origin or in Mexico.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t condone people entering between ports of entry, but Congress has made the decision that if they do, they still need to be allowed to apply for asylum,\u201d he said.\n\n___"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Reuters", "title": "Khashoggi Murder Reportedly Prompts Some Saudi Royals To Turn Against MBS", "description": "Dozens of princes and cousins want to see a change in the line of succession.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jamal-khashoggi-murder-mohammed-bin-salman-family_us_5bf3ad63e4b01909c808d4ae", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf3b0202600000503847cf7.jpeg?cache=wybfsa18ya&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T07:02:45Z", "content": "LONDON (Reuters) - Amid an international uproar over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, some members of Saudi Arabias ruling family are agitating to prevent Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from becoming king, three sources close to the royal court sa\u2026 [+8350 chars]", "fulltext": "LONDON (Reuters) - Amid an international uproar over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, some members of Saudi Arabia\u2019s ruling family are agitating to prevent Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from becoming king, three sources close to the royal court said.\n\nDozens of princes and cousins from powerful branches of the Al Saud family want to see a change in the line of succession but would not act while King Salman - the crown prince\u2019s 82-year-old father - is still alive, the sources said. They recognize that the king is unlikely to turn against his favorite son, known in the West as MbS.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Some members of the Saudi royal family are agitating to prevent Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from becoming king.\n\nRather, they are discussing the possibility with other family members that after the king\u2019s death, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, 76, a younger full brother of King Salman and uncle of the crown prince, could take the throne, according to the sources.\n\nPrince Ahmed, King Salman\u2019s only surviving full brother, would have the support of family members, the security apparatus and some Western powers, one of the Saudi sources said.\n\nPrince Ahmed returned to Riyadh in October after 2-1/2 months abroad. During the trip, he appeared to criticize the Saudi leadership while responding to protesters outside a London residence chanting for the downfall of the Al Saud dynasty. He was one of only three people on the Allegiance Council, made up of the ruling family\u2019s senior members, who opposed MbS becoming crown prince in 2017, two Saudi sources said at the time.\n\nNeither Prince Ahmed nor his representatives could be reached for comment. Officials in Riyadh did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment on succession issues.\n\nThe House of Saud is made up of hundreds of princes. Unlike typical European monarchies, there is no automatic succession from father to eldest son. Instead, the kingdom\u2019s tribal traditions dictate that the king and senior family members from each branch select the heir they consider fittest to lead.\n\nSenior U.S. officials have indicated to Saudi advisers in recent weeks that they would support Prince Ahmed, who was deputy interior minister for nearly 40 years, as a potential successor, according to Saudi sources with direct knowledge of the consultations.\n\nThese Saudi sources said they were confident that Prince Ahmed would not change or reverse any of the social or economic reforms enacted by MbS, would honor existing military procurement contracts and would restore the unity of the family.\n\nOne senior U.S. official said the White House is in no hurry to distance itself from the crown prince despite pressure from lawmakers and the CIA\u2019s assessment that MbS ordered Khashoggi\u2019s murder, though that could change once Trump gets a definitive report on the killing from the intelligence community.\n\nThe official also said the White House saw it as noteworthy that King Salman seemed to stand by his son in a speech in Riyadh on Monday and made no direct reference to Khashoggi\u2019s killing, except to praise the Saudi public prosecutor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday called the CIA assessment that MbS ordered Khashoggi\u2019s killing \u201cvery premature\u201d but \u201cpossible,\u201d and said he would receive a complete report on the case on Tuesday. A White House official referred Reuters to those comments and had \u201cnothing else to add at this time\u201d.\n\nThe Saudi sources said U.S. officials had cooled on MbS not only because of his suspected role in the murder of Khashoggi. They are also rankled because the crown prince recently urged the Saudi defense ministry to explore alternative weapons supplies from Russia, the sources said.\n\nIn a letter dated May 15, seen by Reuters, the crown prince requested that the defense ministry \u201cfocus on purchasing weapon systems and equipment in the most pressing fields\u201d and get training on them, including the Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system.\n\nNeither the Russian defense ministry nor officials in Riyadh immediately responded to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nU.S. ROLE KEY\n\nThe brutal killing of Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the crown prince, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month has drawn global condemnation, including from many politicians and officials in the United States, a key Saudi ally. The CIA believes the crown prince ordered the killing, according to U.S. sources familiar with the assessment.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s public prosecutor has said the crown prince knew nothing of the killing.\n\nThe international uproar has piled pressure on a royal court already divided over 33-year-old Prince Mohammed\u2019s rapid rise to power. Since his ascension, the prince has gained popular support with high-profile social and economic reforms including ending a ban on women driving and opening cinemas in the conservative kingdom.\n\nHis reforms have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, a purge of top royals and businessmen on corruption charges, and a costly war in Yemen.\n\nHe has also marginalized senior members of the royal family and consolidated control over Saudi\u2019s security and intelligence agencies.\n\nHe first ousted then-powerful crown prince and interior minister Mohammed bin Nayef (MbN), 59, in June 2017. Then he removed Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, 65, son of the late King Abdullah, as head of the National Guard and detained him as part of an anti-corruption campaign.\n\nSome 30 other princes were also arrested, mistreated, humiliated and stripped of their wealth, even as MbS splashed out on palaces, a $500 million yacht, and set a new record in the international art market with the purchase of a painting by Italian Renaissance engineer and painter Leonardo Da Vinci.\n\nThe entire House of Saud has emerged weakened as a result.\n\nAccording to one well-placed Saudi source, many princes from senior circles in the family believe a change in the line of succession \u201cwould not provoke any resistance from the security or intelligence bodies he controls\u201d because of their loyalty to the wider family.\n\n\u201cThey (the security apparatus) will follow any consensus reached by the family.\u201d\n\nOfficials in Riyadh did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe United States, a key ally in economic and security terms, is likely to be a determining factor in how matters unfold in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi sources and diplomats say.\n\nTrump and his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner have cultivated deep personal relationships with the crown prince. One Saudi insider said MbS feels he still has their support and is willing to \u201croll some heads to appease the U.S.\u201d\n\nBut Trump and top administration officials have said Saudi officials should be held to account for any involvement in Khashoggi\u2019s death and have imposed sanctions on 17 Saudis for their alleged role \u2013 including one of MbS\u2019s closest aides.\n\nU.S. lawmakers are meanwhile pushing legislation to punish Riyadh for the killing, and both Republican and Democratic senators have urged Trump to get tough on the crown prince.\n\nKing Salman, 82, is aware of the consequences of a major clash with the United States and the possibility that Congress could try to freeze Saudi assets.\n\nThose who have met the king recently say he appeared to be in denial about the role of MbS in what happened, believing there to be a conspiracy against the kingdom. But they added that he looked burdened and worried.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Amid an international uproar over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Saudi King Salman expressed support for his son, the crown prince, who is accused or orchestrating the slaying.\n\nALLEGIANCE COUNCIL\n\nWhen the king dies or is no longer be able to rule, the 34-member Allegiance Council, a body representing each line of the ruling family to lend legitimacy to succession decisions, would not automatically declare MbS the new king.\n\nEven as crown prince, MbS would still need the council to ratify his ascension, one of the three Saudi sources said. While the council accepted King Salman\u2019s wish to make MbS crown prince, it would not necessarily accept MbS becoming king when his father dies, especially given that he sought to marginalize council members.\n\nOfficials in Riyadh did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Saudi sources say MbS has destroyed the institutional pillars of nearly a century of Al Saud rule: the family, the clerics, the tribes and the merchant families. They say this is seen inside the family as destabilizing.\n\nDespite the controversy over Khashoggi\u2019s killing, MbS is continuing to pursue his agenda.\n\nSome insiders believe he built his father a new but remote Red Sea palace in Sharma, at the Neom City development site \u2014 thrown up in a record one year at a cost of $2 billion \u2014 as a gilded cage for his retirement.\n\nThe site is isolated, the closest city of Tabouk more than 100 km (60 miles) away. Residence there would keep the king out of the loop on most affairs of state, one of the sources close to the royal family said."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Ed Mazza", "title": "Colbert Ends 10 Seconds Of Stunned Silence With A Blistering Response To Trump", "description": "The \"Late Show\" host says there's one thing he wants from the president.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-colbert-donald-trump-wildfires_us_5bf37957e4b0d9e7283c6cb7", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf3868e2000007c060294c4.jpeg?cache=tfDsuAOaje&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T04:29:14Z", "content": "Stephen Colbert isn\u2019t silent often, but he went quiet for nearly 10 seconds after playing a clip of President Donald Trump visiting California as the state battles some of the worst wildfires in its history.

Somewhere that is recently legal doesn\u2019t have the same supply as let\u2019s say California, but the demand will be very high.\n\n\u201cI imagine that we will see these shortages for a number of years while the producers catch up with the ever-growing demand.\u201d\n\nOthers like Hannah Davis of Mammoth Distribution, which distributes cannabis products all over California, believes retailers are prepared for the lift in sales.\n\n\u201cWe expect sales to double this week, but we\u2019re seeing our retailers stocking up so, hopefully, it\u2019s not an issue,\u201d she said. \u201cI do expect people to make larger purchases to share with friends.\u201d\n\nAnd what are they sharing?\n\nDennis Hunter of Cannacraft, a California-based brand of medical cannabis products, says he\u2019s seeing high sales in \u201cdiscreet\u201d cannabis products like edibles and soft gels that can be consumed under the radar at family functions.\n\n\u201cThanksgiving is a mixed bag of emotions; some customers are looking to cannabis for stress relief during the busy holiday and others are in the giving spirit and looking to share products they love with their loved ones,\u201d Hunter said.\n\nBut with great pot comes responsibility. There is the risk that some people might overindulge, especially if they aren\u2019t used to being stoned, according to Rosie Rothrock, VP of Marketing at Caliva, a San Jose based retailer.\n\n\u201cStart low in dosage and go slow,\u201d she advised. \u201cPatience is the key to enjoying cannabis and finding what\u2019s right for you!\u201d\n\nAlthough people have been smoking marijuana for decades, having it be legal at Thanksgiving time could present some unintended consequences, according to Dr. Juli Crockett, the director of compliance of MMLG, a Los Angeles-based cannabis consultancy that advises clients on licensing, compliance, investment and business planning."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Nick Visser", "title": "Shooting At Chicago Hospital Leaves 4 Dead, Including Police Officer", "description": "A gunman who opened fire at Chicago\u2019s Mercy Hospital also died after shooting two hospital employees and an officer.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chicago-mercy-hospital-shooting-death-toll_us_5bf36c20e4b0d9e7283c6a34", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf370bd3c0000f9030ebb38.jpeg?cache=HWRleFsOMt&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T02:38:32Z", "content": "Four people were killed during a shooting on Monday at Chicago\u2019s Mercy Hospital &amp; Medical Center, including a city police officer and two hospital employees, authorities said.

The team also administered more wellness checks on homeless residents and added additional beds to the shelter system last week, Quezada said.\n\nBut these efforts won\u2019t be enough. The city has about 2,300 beds total in its shelters, according to Quezada. Meanwhile, San Francisco had about 7,500 homeless people, including more than 4,300 who were unsheltered or living outdoors, according to its latest count in 2017. And not all shelters are open 24 hours a day, prompting city officials to direct people to centers that are open all day, as well as other public places like libraries.\n\nHolmes said members of her group in Sonoma had \u201cdefinitely\u201d seen the recent air pollution affecting the homeless people they serve.

The region\u2019s available housing stock has once again shrunk as the Camp fire burned through about 10,000 homes around Paradise, making it that much harder for the currently homeless to find affordable housing to move into.\n\nAfter last year\u2019s deadly fires in Sonoma and Napa burned more than 4,500 homes around Santa Rosa, the area\u2019s number of homeless people rose about 6 percent \u2015 the first increase after years of decline, Holmes said.\n\n\u201cThe reason they can\u2019t escape [air pollution] is because there is not enough low-income housing,\u201d said Steptoe, noting that the Bay Area\u2019s notoriously high housing prices make it hard for homeless people to access affordable housing. \u201cPeople can\u2019t even afford housing who have jobs.\u201d\n\nRains are expected to come by mid-week, which could offer some respite from the fires and improve air quality.

The bureau only publishes aggregated information, and the law requires that it only be used for statistical purposes.\n\nBut in a recently disclosed June email, a top aide to John Gore, then the acting head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, advised him to give an ambiguous answer to a legal question from a member of Congress about protecting census data.\n\nIn 2010, the Justice Department\u2019s Office Of Legal Counsel, or OLC, authored a memo saying that the Patriot Act did not compel the secretary of commerce to give law enforcement access to census answers that would otherwise be kept confidential. Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.) asked Gore if the DOJ still agreed with that opinion and whether any federal law could require the Census Bureau to turn over confidential census data to law enforcement.\n\nJ.

Kelly Laco, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment on the exchange. A spokesman for the Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSasha Samberg-Champion, a former senior attorney in the Civil Rights Division\u2019s appellate section, cautioned against reading the email to Gore as an indication of whether the Trump administration would ultimately revisit the OLC opinion.\n\n\u201cIf OLC actually revisits the 2010 opinion, that will be a big deal,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cI\u2019m hesitant to do much tea leaf reading regarding the Civil Rights Division declining to signal DOJ\u2019s intentions one or the other here. What I will say is that it was presented with the opportunity to be reassuring and declined to provide such reassurances.\u201d\n\nIt makes sense that Gore would give a noncommittal answer on the question because it was outside the scope of his division, said Justin Levitt, a former Justice Department official who is now a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. Still, he said, \u201ca different Administration might have thought it more important to tuck in more assurances that there\u2019s been no change.\u201d\n\nOLC clearly interpreted federal law to require broad protections for the confidentiality of census data, said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a census consultant who formerly worked as staff director of the House Census and Population Subcommittee. It\u2019s alarming the Justice Department may see wiggle room, she said.\n\n\u201cThis should have been a slam-dunk no-brainer for the Justice Department to reaffirm that interpretation.

Getting as many people as possible to respond to the census is critical because census data is used to determine how billions of dollars in federal funds are allocated and how electoral districts get drawn.\n\n\u201cAny suggestion that census responses are not protected by an impenetrable wall from use by other government agencies could threaten the entire enumeration,\u201d Lowenthal said. \u201cThe guarantee of ironclad confidentiality of personal census responses is a cornerstone of a successful census. If that cornerstone is removed, the entire enterprise could come falling down.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has maintained it can get an accurate census count despite concerns over the citizenship question. John Abowd, the Census Bureau\u2019s chief scientist, testified in a federal trial last week that the bureau\u2019s extensive plans to follow up with people who don\u2019t respond to the census would ensure as accurate a tally as possible.\n\nIn the 1940s, the U.S. government used Census Bureau data to target Japanese-Americans for incarceration. The episode, which the bureau apologized for decades later, prompted it to strengthen its confidentiality protections.\n\nThe 2010 OLC memo came just ahead of the nation\u2019s first decennial census following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Lowenthal said there was concern that the government could use some of the provisions of the Patriot Act to obtain information collected through the census, but the memo makes it clear that the law could not be used in that way. In the memo, OLC says the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division believed the secretary of commerce could be required to produce confidential census information under Section 215 of the law, but OLC did not agree, concluding the census information was protected.\n\nThe guarantee of ironclad confidentiality of personal census responses is a cornerstone of a successful census. If that cornerstone is removed, the entire enterprise could come falling down. Terri Ann Lowenthal\n\nThe email to Gore was \u201creally bad,\u201d said John Thompson, who served as director of the Census Bureau from 2013-2017 and worked there for decades before that.\n\n\u201cHow can the Census Bureau promise respondents that their information will be safe,\u201d Thompson, who served as an expert witness for the plaintiffs in the New York case, asked in an email.\n\nLeaving the door open to not protecting data would be strongly at odds with the position of the Census Bureau. In May, Ron Jarmin, the bureau\u2019s acting director, wrote a blog post unequivocally saying that individual census responses are protected from being shared with law enforcement.\n\n\u201cI know that one important concern is how the census data will be used and there is often a question of whether the Census Bureau shares information with law enforcement agencies like the FBI, ICE or even the local police,\u201d Jarmin wrote. \u201cI assure you that this does not happen and it is prohibited by Title 13. Title 13 makes it very clear that the data we collect can only be used for statistical purposes and cannot be shared for nonstatistical purposes \u2014 including law enforcement.\u201d\n\nIn light of the email, the Trump administration should provide new assurances about the confidentiality of census responses, said Vanita Gupta, the former head of the Civil Rights Division under President Barack Obama and current president and CEO of the Leadership Conference Education Fund."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Lydia O'Connor", "title": "Ivanka Used Personal Email For Government Business Hundreds Of Times: Report", "description": "\u201cShe was the worst offender in the White House,\u201d one insider told The Washington Post of Trump's eldest daughter.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ivanka-trump-private-email-government-business_us_5bf34be4e4b01909c8089a47", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf351712400003604583680.jpeg?ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-20T00:30:19Z", "content": "Ivanka Trump, the eldest daughter of President Donald Trump and his official adviser, used a personal account to send hundreds of emails last year related to government business, according to sources who spoke with The Washington Post.

Perhaps more concerning, her use of a private email server may increase the risk of sensitive information falling into the wrong hands.\n\nMany of the details in the emails were related to Trump\u2019s official work schedule, travel details and meeting arrangements with public and private sector workers."}]
