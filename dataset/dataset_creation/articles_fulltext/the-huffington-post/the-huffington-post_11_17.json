That group suggested that the animals may be suffering from distemper, a serious viral disease that can be transmitted to other animals, including dogs.

It is offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to the conviction of the person who shot the animal.\n\nMarine Animal Rescue The dolphin, found floating in the surf in Manhattan Beach, California, died from a gunshot wound.\n\nMarine Animal Rescue founder Peter Wallerstein told NBC News that he got a call last week from someone who spotted the dolphin floating in the surf. He retrieved the animal\u2019s body and then contacted authorities in the hopes of opening an investigation into who did this, although he admitted that \u201cwe very rarely find these people.\u201d\n\nWallerstein told BuzzFeed News that his organization frequently sees sea lions that have been shot because they steal bait off boats and otherwise interfere with fishing.

It\u2019s an \u201cact of brutality,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier this year, a similar incident in Mississippi made headlines when a pregnant dolphin was found fatally shot on a beach in April. The unborn calf did not survive. Federal authorities announced in July that they were looking for information on whoever was responsible.\n\nSince dolphins fall under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, a person found responsible for killing one could face up to $100,000 in fines and one year in prison.\n\nAlthough Wallerstein noted that dolphins normally don\u2019t interfere with humans fishing, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in July that the wild animals sometimes learn this kind of behavior when people feed them. That teaches them to start approaching boats in search of food, which can lead to conflict with fishermen."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Jenavieve Hatch", "title": "Camp Fire Survivors Are Now Refugees In Their Own Country", "description": "In makeshift refugee camps, survivors of Northern California's Camp fire face homelessness, norovirus and loss.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-wildfires-camp-fire-survivors_us_5bf0546fe4b07573881ef978", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf05eb81d00008800313339.jpeg?cache=miYwjq5fQi&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T21:35:36Z", "content": "CHICO, Calif.

End-of-days stuff.\n\n\u201cWe might be back, it won\u2019t be that big a deal,\u201d Gonzales, 28, told his fiancee as they packed a bag of clothes.\n\nHe thought he was only evacuating temporarily. Like so many residents of Paradise, California, who have been displaced by the ongoing Camp fire, he hoped that perhaps his family\u2019s home could be saved. But as the hours passed, and refugees poured out of Paradise in cars and buses and on foot, it became clear that the wind-driven fire was moving faster and faster.\n\nThat night, Gonzales gathered his family. \u201cWe should start to be OK with the fact that maybe our stuff is gone,\u201d he told them.\n\nNow, just over a week later, the blaze that drove Gonzales out of Paradise has killed at least 71 people and become the most destructive fire in California history. More than 1,000 people are believed to be missing. And as the adrenaline of the evacuation has faded, the grim reality of indefinite displacement has set in.\n\n* * *\n\nNeighbors saved Vivian, too. Her next-door neighbors\u2019 son woke up the 80-year-old Paradise resident and drove her, and her two cats, out of town before the fire hit. She believes she would not have survived the wind-driven, fast-moving flames if her neighbors hadn\u2019t helped.\n\n\u201cWithout them, I would have been ash,\u201d she said. \u201cI grabbed the cats, my toothbrush, my comb, and put on my sweats, and got in the car. That was it.\u201d\n\nA week later, she found out her house was gone.\n\nVivian now sleeps next to her two crated cats on a cot at the makeshift shelter at East Ave Church in Chico. Despite the grief of losing her house, she has found some gratitude in not being one of the hundreds of evacuees sick with the norovirus that\u2019s plaguing the shelter and many others in town.\n\nLibby Andresen, another woman in the East Ave Church shelter, has not been as lucky. She shares a mattress with her elderly mother, and told HuffPost that they\u2019d been moved through the shelter twice to avoid getting the virus. By Thursday, a week after Andresen lost her Paradise home in the fire, she was bedridden and sick.\n\nBefore the medical team was able to provide assistance and a barrier, and before the National Guard sent in medical and quarantine tents on Friday morning, there was \u201cno dignity for anyone,\u201d Andresen said, as more and more people began throwing up and getting diarrhea, two of the norovirus symptoms. Volunteers had to help clean up, and later bleach, the floors that had been contaminated with human waste. Several evacuees have taken to wearing adult diapers as a precaution, as portable toilets become filthy and inaccessible.\n\nMedical staff from the shelter told HuffPost that while many evacuees showed symptoms, they had not yet confirmed whether they had norovirus.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the first person got sick, we quarantined them as best we could in these very austere conditions with the very limited resources at our disposal,\u201d Elisabeth Gundersen, a volunteer registered nurse, told HuffPost.\n\n\u201cWe did a lot of grassroots fundraising to purchase the necessary supplies to quarantine folks and we also submitted requests to the Department of Public Health and to CalMat. Understandably both agencies were completely overwhelmed and did their very best to meet our needs as quickly as they could, but resources were a challenge for everyone,\u201d she said.\n\nCayce Clifford for HuffPost The entire city of Paradise is still blocked off to residents. Meanwhile, much of Butte County's wildlife is trying to survive as well.\n\nCayce Clifford for HuffPost Ridgewood Mobile Home Park, a community of senior residents in Paradise, was completely destroyed. Theresa, from the state's forestry and fire protection agency, assesses the damage.\n\nCayce Clifford for HuffPost More than 27,000 Paradise residents have been displaced.\n\nA week ago, the East Ave Church shelter had a \u201csummer camp feel,\u201d one volunteer told HuffPost. But that sense of optimism has faded, as victims get sicker and more tired and come to terms with the loss of homes, possessions and loved ones.\n\nOn top of the loss of possessions and personal space, the physical illness and the lack of access to medical care, victims will face long-term trauma, a survivor of another major California fire told HuffPost.\n\nThe Camp fire victims \u201care not going to have a fucking clue how traumatized they are\u201d for some time, Caz Tomaszewski said Tuesday. Tomaszewski lost his home in 2015 to the Butte fire in Calaveras County. He still experiences symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder from trying to save his home.\n\n\u201cA fire fucks up a person\u2019s head in way different ways than you\u2019d expect,\u201d he said. \u201cMost people assume it\u2019s losing all your shit and having to run for your life that does it... But more than that it\u2019s losing all routines, all familiarity, all safe places, every place that is yours to be, and your community to boot.\u201d\n\nAnd, Tomaszewski said, \u201cit\u2019s being steeped in everybody else\u2019s loss.\u201d\n\nGonzales\u2019 nephews and nieces, used to spending their days traipsing in the woods outside their home, are growing bored and confused. Libby wants to salvage her wind chimes. What Vivian wants more than anything is to take a shower in her own house.\n\nThen she remembers it\u2019s not there anymore.\n\n* * *\n\nFor the many displaced residents, the physical struggle is far easier to deal with than the stress of waiting to learn about the state of their homes, or, worse, their loved ones.\n\nCayce Clifford for HuffPost Willy's dog, Misty, was hit by a car while they evacuated Paradise on Nov. 8.\n\nCayce Clifford for HuffPost No mobile homes in the Ridgewood Mobile Home Park were saved in the Camp fire.\n\nCayce Clifford for HuffPost East Ave Church in Chico has become a makeshift evacuation center.\n\nThe streets to Paradise and the neighboring towns are still closed to everyone except emergency personnel and members of the press, and thousands of evacuees eagerly await news of their homes as the county updates the addresses of destroyed property. Most homes and businesses in Paradise and Magalia are active crime scenes, law enforcement officers told HuffPost on Thursday. Officials from Cal Fire, the state department of forestry and fire protection, have been assessing the damage and searching for human remains.\n\n\u201cWe got so, so lucky. No one was hurt or left behind,\u201d Gonzales, who is now staying with family friends in Lincoln, about 90 minutes south of Chico, told HuffPost.\n\n\u201cBut finally seeing [our home on the list of destroyed structures] was just stomach-sinking, throat-closing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe house had this little archway that the kids had painted pink and purple last week... That\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s there now. There was so much house, and it\u2019s so gone now. Not much can prepare you for that.\u201d\n\nJenavieve Hatch, a HuffPost reporter from Sacramento, is reporting on the scene in California this week with photographer Cayce Clifford, talking to people affected by the Camp fire.

How deep can political corruption run? How does a person overcome tragedy alone? And what should you do with your dog before the big heist?\n\nViola Davis answers all three, playing a Chicago lobbyist named Veronica whose career-criminal husband (Liam Neeson) dies on the job. Two menacing mobsters (Brian Tyree Henry and Daniel Kaluuya) demand she settle his $2 million debt, leaving Veronica and her fellow widows scrambling to execute the heist their spouses could not. Suddenly without a family and finding herself face to face with crooked lawmakers, Veronica has one comfort left: her fluffy dog.\n\nDespite her no-frills moxie, Veronica loves little Olivia, a cute West Highland White Terrier that becomes a vestige of the days before everything went to shambles. Olivia, a role brought to life by the same talented thespian that played Jesse Plemons\u2019 pup in \u201cGame Night,\u201d humanizes Veronica as she sinks further into the crime world. She cares for the dog so much that she thinks to take it to a kennel on the night of the heist, just in case she doesn\u2019t make it out alive. Action movies don\u2019t usually let us consider such logistics, preferring to focus on the wham-bam of it all, but \u201cWidows\u201d pauses to treat Olivia as the one constant amid Veronica\u2019s trauma. (\u201cIt softens her,\u201d director Steve McQueen recently told me.) The pooch gets some good laughs, but she\u2019s also an important narrative fulcrum, playing a key part in the film\u2019s biggest twist. And that, my friends, is the work of a very good girl. \u2015 Matthew Jacobs\n\nSoup For Breakfast\n\nSMarina via Getty Images\n\nYou might have noticed, East Coasters, that it got really fucking cold all of a sudden, making the already daunting task of getting out of bed in the morning exponentially more agonizing. But on the other hand, soup. Morning soup. It\u2019s here to help.\n\nJust think of it: the warm feeling you get from that first sip of coffee, combined with the savory surprise of vegetables, lentils, chicken stock, beef, or whatever else you fancy. I\u2019ve been opting for miso soup this week, simply mixing miso paste in hot water and sprinkling in some scallions if I feel crazy. Sip it from a mug and you\u2019re having tea and food at the same time. Do you know how warm and full I feel before 8 a.m.?\n\nWhile I haven\u2019t yet experimented with very many morning soup options, the cold, sad times ahead promise plenty of opportunities for soup play. Sweet breakfast is a scam and we\u2019d all be better off if we loosened up a bit and drank more meat before sunrise.\n\nBone broth is for assholes. Soup is the liquid food of the people. \u2015 Priscilla Frank\n\nThe Season 13 Finale Of \u2018It\u2019s Always Sunny In Philadelphia\u2019\n\nThe season 13 finale of \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny In Philadelphia\u201d is more than a week old now, but I still can\u2019t get past the episode\u2019s deeply emotional five-minute dance number performed by Rob McElhenney\u2019s character Mac and professional ballerina Kylie Shea.\n\nThe dance is an interpretation of Mac\u2019s complicated feelings about his sexuality, and serves as a way for Mac to come out to his father Luther (Gregory Scott Cummins). As he says in the episode, \u201cThere\u2019s like this storm inside of me and it\u2019s been raging my whole life, and I\u2019m down on my knees, and I\u2019m looking for answers, and then God comes down to me and it\u2019s a very hot chick and she pulls me up and we start dancing.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Vulture, McElhenney said Mac\u2019s explanation for the dance was meant to be funny in that it\u2019s \u201cintensely confusing.\u201d That\u2019s a pretty standard \u201cSunny\u201d move (see: almost any reason Charlie Kelly [Charlie Day] gives for anything he does, ever). But the manifestation of that vision was something completely refreshing to longtime fans of the show. There is no shtick or gimmick behind the choreographed piece, a stunning pas de deux set to Sigur R\u00f3s\u2019 \u201cVar\u00fa\u00f0\u201d that McElhenney says took him seven months to train for. Even a non-dance expert can tell it was physically and emotionally strenuous.\n\nMcElhenny executes it beautifully, capping a years-long story arc that has seen Mac struggling with body image, sexuality and his interactions with others as a gay man. There\u2019s a tangible weight to the moment; as a viewer, you feel an emotional release in tandem with Mac, who sheds a rare sincere tear during the dance. It evokes a baptism, an image amplified by the rain-soaked stage on which McElhenny and Shea perform. There\u2019s extreme intimacy in watching Mac finally embrace his identity, finding his place among his family, friends and gay culture, even as some \u2015 namely, his dad \u2015 reject him.\n\nIt was more than a singularly impressive event in the show; it was a sharp departure for the series, which tends to make progressive statements through a cast of characters who are lovable but terrible. Even the first 20 minutes of \u201cMac Finds His Pride\u201d are typical \u201cSunny\u201d fare, giving no real indication the show will take a serious turn. But the minute Mac steps on stage, a palpable shift occurs. The earnestness of it is almost breathtaking, a jarring moment after 13 years of dark humor that has explored the worst of society.\n\nThe episode has been widely praised, which makes sense. McElhenney said there was an \u201coverwhelming emotional response from the LGBTQ community\u201d when Mac came out as gay, which he took to heart, aiming for a \u201cmuch more emotionally resonant end to the season.\u201d\n\nMac\u2019s dance will certainly rank as one of the most memorable scenes in \u201cSunny\u2019s\u201d history. Those cathartic five minutes of television might even change the tone of \u201cSunny\u201d going forward. (The show has already been renewed for a 14th season.) Mac\u2019s surrogate father Frank (Danny DeVito), who begins the episode admitting he doesn\u2019t get Mac\u2019s sexuality, even achieves some clarity in what\u2019s perhaps the most touching line in the show\u2019s 13 seasons.\n\n\u201cOh my god, I get it,\u201d Frank says, teary-eyed. \u201cI get it.\u201d \u2015 Paige Lavender\n\nThis Basic Beauty\n\nI\u2019m 30, so I feel like everyone is having a baby right now, which is probably not true. Two people who are having a baby, though, are Arie Luyendyk Jr. and his runner-up fianc\u00e9e, Lauren Burnham! Less than a year ago, he was engaged to her \u201cBachelor\u201d competitor Becca Kufrin, and now, just one horrific on-camera dumping later, look at them: a Hawaii wedding planned for January, and a little Luyendyk-Burnham on the way.\n\nAnyway, this is not what I\u2019m excited about, though I fully support babies. What brought me joy this week was the couple\u2019s influencer-chic announcement photo shoot with Us Weekly, which they shared on their own Instagram accounts. The photo Lauren posted, in particular, was like Insta-couple bingo. The couple kissing, check; the ultrasound photos, check; her gigantor rock dangling oh-so-casually in the center of the photo, check. (Her engagement ring appears to be the only thing actually in focus in the picture.) They\u2019re sharing a loving clinch with her hand clutching the sheet of ultrasound images, as if the photographer caught the moment when she shyly showed her partner the proof of their impending bundle of joy. It\u2019s all transparently stage-managed to appear un-managed, natural, and enviable.\n\nI love these basic bitches, and I love that they have refused to stop being influencers even though the entirety of the \u201cBachelor\u201d fan base views them as sort of the opposite of goals. If they can dream it, they can become it. \u2015 Claire Fallon\n\nThe Union Of Michael B. Jordan And Jaden Smith\n\nWhat you call an icon livin\u2019? I call it Michael B. Jordan\u2019s Adonis Creed walking out to Jaden Smith\u2019s \u201cIcon\u201d for one of his matches in \u201cCreed II.\u201d\n\nSure, the reviews say quippy things like \u201cCreed II\u201d doesn\u2019t \u201cpack the same punch\u201d or isn\u2019t as much of a \u201cknockout.\u201d I can only guess these reviewers fell asleep. Because there\u2019s nothing more iconic than seeing Jordan, aka Killmonger, walking to the ring to the beat of Smith, who once told me he believes a real place like Wakanda actually exists. \u2015 Bill Bradley\n\nThe Kacey Musgraves Upset\n\nImage Group LA via Getty Images\n\nKacey Musgraves pulled off a surprising upset Wednesday night when she won the Country Music Association\u2019s Album of the Year award for \u201cGolden Hour,\u201d the \u201cgalactic country\u201d collection she released in March. On paper, \u201cGolden Hour\u201d should have been considered a favorite even in a category packed with big names. It was a fantastic album that topped sales charts and managed to be both quintessentially Musgraves and an evolutionary work that twisted and bent the country genre in new ways. But it wasn\u2019t the favorite, in part because of who Musgraves was up against, and in part because of who Musgraves is. Or rather, what she is, and what her opponents are: a woman in a genre that doesn\u2019t appreciate its women, going up against a bunch of dudes in a genre that over-appreciates its dudes.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say Chris Stapleton, Dierks Bentley, Keith Urban and Thomas Rhett didn\u2019t produce work deserving of acclaim. It\u2019s just that every corner of the country music world trips over itself constantly to dish out love to the guys, while it rarely finds time to do the same for women. Musgraves\u2019 win made her just the sixth solo woman to grab the CMA Album of the Year award in its 52-year history. Solo male artists have won 37 times. That Musgraves did so with an album that failed to break through on country radio, despite the critical love it received and the sheer quality of its work, makes the victory an even bigger deal.\n\nThe country music world shouldn\u2019t pat itself on the back for making a rather obvious decision. \u201cGolden Hour\u201d getting its due on the big stage doesn\u2019t make up for the fact that its best offerings, including singles \u201cSpace Cowboy\u201d and \u201cButterflies,\u201d predictably (if undeservedly) bombed on the radio, or that Musgraves and other women like her have to constantly overcome barriers to get a modicum of praise from the industry. That a victory for an album as good as \u201cGolden Hour\u201d is remarkable is itself a statement on the state of country music. But in a genre where women are creating most, if not all, of the best and most interesting work, it\u2019s about time someone beyond Miranda Lambert (who also doesn\u2019t get enough acclaim) finally got something resembling her due.\n\nIt\u2019s probably too optimistic to believe that victory will cause a seismic shift in an industry that would still rather spin the latest formulaic dude hit than try something new, especially when the fresh take comes from a woman. But the manner of the announcement itself was proof that \u201cGolden Hour\u201d had, and will continue to have, an impact on other women inside country and beyond. \u201cAnd the CMA Award for album of the year goes to,\u201d Little Big Town\u2019s Karen Fairchild said as she announced the winner, \u201cfor all the little girls writing songs out there, \u2018Golden Hour,\u2019 Kacey Musgraves!\u201d \u2015 Travis Waldron\n\nThe Most Deeply Terrible And Thus Perfect \u2018Bachelor\u2019 Tag Line\n\nClaire already shined a spotlight on the joy and pain of former Bachelor Arie Luyendyk Jr. and his fianc\u00e9e Lauren Burnham\u2019s recently announced forthcoming baby.

In case viewers thought they\u2019d be getting a break from in-depth dissection of this man\u2019s sexual history (or lack thereof), this tag line tells us loudly and clearly: no.

Now they just need a speaker of the House.\n\nThe standoff over Nancy Pelosi\u2019s bid to regain the gavel intensified as Democrats left Washington for the Thanksgiving break in what has turned out to be an unsettling finish to an otherwise triumphant week that saw them welcome a historic class of newcomers to Capitol Hill and prepare to take control from Republicans.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is jumping in to offer some help, saying Saturday that he could \u201cperform a wonderful service\u201d by rounding up Republican votes for Pelosi\u2019s candidacy. Trump says he genuinely likes Pelosi and looks forward to working with her, but it\u2019s an almost unheard of proposition for the party that relied on the California Democrat as a chief villain on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cI would help Nancy Pelosi if she needs some votes,\u201d Trump told reporters as he left the White House for a trip to survey the devastation from the California wildfires. \u201cI like her, can you believe it? I like Nancy Pelosi. She\u2019s tough and she\u2019s smart, but she deserves to be speaker, and now they\u2019re playing games with her, just like they\u2019ll be playing with me.\u201d\n\nPelosi, who was the first woman to become speaker and served from 2007 to 2011, was certain that she will hold that post again. Last week she dismissed a suggestion that she could rely on Republican support to help amass the House majority needed in January when Democrats take control of the chamber after this month\u2019s election victory.\n\n\u201cOh, please, no, never, never, never,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump went so far Saturday to tweet the name of one Republican congressman, Rep. Tom Reed of New York, who has said he could be open to backing Pelosi if she committed to changes that would shift some power from the House leadership. Reed is a part of the Problem Solvers Caucus, whose members have broached the idea as a show of bipartisanship to help reform Congress. Reed welcomed Trump\u2019s tweet Saturday even though GOP lawmakers considering endorsing Pelosi would open themselves up criticism in their 2020 re-election bids for daring to support someone their base has reviled.\n\n\u201cThe president understands Congress is broken,\u201d said Reed\u2019s spokesman Will, Reinert. Reed has said for months \u201che\u2019s open to voting for anyone who promises to reform the House of Representatives for the American people.\u201d\n\nPelosi met with the group last week, but not with Reed or other Republicans.\n\n\u201cLeader Pelosi will win the speakership with Democratic votes,\u201d her spokesman Drew Hammill said Saturday.\n\nPelosi was expected to work the phones from California during the break after meeting privately with newly elected Democrats who could be crucial to her bid. Her foes were equally confident they have the votes to stop her ascension.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s a band of disgruntled Democrats, led mostly by men, in the forefront of the opposition. With a test vote looming in late November, and at least one potential Pelosi challenger stepping forward, Democrats are facing the uncomfortable prospect of the internal squabble that the speaker\u2019s vote Jan. 3 could drag on for weeks.\n\n\u201cI think chaos is good if it\u2019s productive. I think chaos is bad if it is too disruptive and it divides us too much,\u201d said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, whose leaders were upbeat after meeting with Pelosi this past week.\n\nNewly elected lawmakers indicated they were having good meetings with the leader, though few said the talks had changed their minds.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t about her, it\u2019s about wanting new leadership,\u201d said Rep.-elect Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, a former CIA operative who defeated tea party Republican Rep. Dave Brat in suburban Richmond. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything she could say, because the decision isn\u2019t about her.\u201d\n\nRep.-elect Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey said he had a \u201cpleasant\u201d meeting, but remains a \u201cno\u201d on Pelosi. He is among 17 Democrats who have signed on to a letter opposing her. Van Drew said they discussed his districts and which committees he\u2019d like to serve on. \u201cI don\u2019t feel under pressure,\u201d he said.\n\nPelosi also has met with Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, a potential rival for the speakership who said the two had \u201ca very open and frank discussion.\u201d\n\nFudge said she would probably decide after Thanksgiving break whether she will run.\n\n\u201cTo her credit, she wanted to know what my concerns were,\u201d Fudge said. \u201cWhat she asked me was, basically, how we could get to a point where I\u2019m supportive.\u201d\n\nOne question for some Democrats is what, exactly, Pelosi means when she says she intends to be a transitional leader, a bridge to a new generation. She has led the party for 15 years.\n\nIf it were up to most of the Democratic Party, Pelosi easily would win. They see her as a skilled and tested leader prepared to confront Trump and deliver on priorities.\n\nPelosi, 78, first became speaker after Democrats took control of the House in midterm elections during former President George W. Bush\u2019s second term. With President Barack Obama, she was pivotal in passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010.\n\nWith a narrow Democratic majority, now at 231 seats in the 435-member House, Pelosi does not have much cushion to secure the 218 votes needed, assuming all Republicans vote against her, as expected. Some House races remain undecided and the Democratic majority could grow slightly.\n\nThere is a chance the math could shift in Pelosi\u2019s favor if lawmakers are absent or simply vote \u201cpresent,\u201d meaning she would need fewer than 218 votes for an absolute majority.\n\n___"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Mary Papenfuss", "title": "Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker Hit With Supreme Court Challenge", "description": "The motion argues that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should by law take over for the ousted Jeff Sessions.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/matthew-whitaker-supreme-court-acting-attorney-general_us_5bef985ee4b07573881eb390", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bef9cba3c0000f9030eba5f.jpeg?cache=mGzhpSmtOk&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T14:18:14Z", "content": "President Donald Trump \u2019s appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general was challenged Friday in a surprise motion calling on the Supreme Court to substitute Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein instead.

Goldstein is asking the justices to determine who should now be the valid defendant in the case \u2014 and many other pending cases directed at the federal government\u2019s top law enforcement official.\n\n\u201cThis is the extraordinary case in which the identity of the successor is both contested and has important implications for the administration of justice nationally,\u201d the motion states.\n\nGoldstein contends that federal law requires that the Senate-confirmed deputy attorney general \u2015 Rosenstein \u2015 should automatically take over when the attorney general\u2019s office is vacant. Whitaker was serving as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, a post that was not Senate-confirmed.\n\nGoldstein also filed a motion in federal court earlier this week challenging Whitaker\u2019s appointment on behalf of Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh (D), The Washington Post reported. It too argued that Rosenstein be installed in Whitaker\u2019s place.\n\nWhitaker is under pressure to recuse himself from anything to do with the ongoing investigation into possible Russian collusion by the Trump campaign. He previously expressed disdain for the probe by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel has issued an opinion supporting Trump\u2019s authority to appoint Whitaker.\n\nThe lawsuit linked to Friday\u2019s challenge was brought by Barry Michaels, a Nevada man convicted of securities fraud two decades ago, who wants the Supreme Court to rule that people convicted of certain non-violent felonies should not lose the right to own a gun.

My fianc\u00e9 proposed at Disney World, and I went back to work to find a queue of women at my desk. The questions started.\n\n\n\n\u201cDid you know he was going to ask? Were you surprised? Did you cry?\u201d I admitted that yes, I knew he was going to ask, and no, I didn\u2019t cry. At all. In fact, I had a fit of the giggles. My answers were met with polite but disappointed faces. After all, as these women told me, I\u2019d just experienced \u201cevery girl\u2019s dream.\u201d\n\nMy Mum found that people wished to congratulate her, too, as though she had done an excellent job in selecting for her only daughter a single man of good fortune, who was in want of a wife. In reality, my Mum is as unromantic as I am, and was pleased but not especially overwhelmed.\n\nWhen the novelty of my new status wore off, I was relieved. Maybe I\u2019d be left alone now to get on with planning my wedding in peace. Not so. The whole process seemed to be set 50 years in the past. Having a ring on a particular finger apparently told people things about me, and those people expected me to be a woman I am very much not. The sort of woman who was interested in napkins, silverware and making my husband\u2019s dinner.\n\nSome highlights of venue hunting included wedding coordinators who spoke only to me as though my fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t even there (because as a man, he doesn\u2019t actually care, apparently), one woman who advised me to \u201cmake sure he attends his suit appointments,\u201d and venue staff who were truly baffled by my lack of interest in chair sashes. They seemed to feel that my whole life had been leading up to this moment.\n\nPeople refer me to as 'the future Mrs. Whitney,' which makes me want to jab them in the eyes with a fork.\n\nEvery time I meet new people, the round of wedding quizzes begins again. Was I disappointed he hadn\u2019t dressed smartly to propose? Am I going to lose weight for the big day? Someone tells me on average once a week that they \u201ccan\u2019t believe I\u2019m not stressed.\u201d My wedding is over a year away, and people seem to be astonished that I can think of anything else.\n\nWedding planning is not anywhere near as much as fun as I had hoped. Instead, I feel like I\u2019m bad at it, the wrong sort of bride, because I don\u2019t want a particularly traditional wedding. But I\u2019m also not planning a pagan handfasting in the woods. I\u2019ve booked a nice hotel wedding venue, and my Dad will walk me down the aisle. But I\u2019m also comfortably ditching any tradition that doesn\u2019t appeal to me. I won\u2019t be throwing the bouquet, and the idea of me promising to honor and obey made my fianc\u00e9 laugh so much he nearly hyperventilated.\n\nThis choice seems to confuse well-meaning acquaintances immensely, and somehow my wedding is \u201cincorrect.\u201d I\u2019ve felt this from the start, with reactions to my purple sapphire engagement ring, which is often declared \u201cunusual,\u201d or my personal favorite from my Nan, \u201cvery large.\u201d I\u2019ve been told they \u201ccan\u2019t picture me getting married in a hotel,\u201d which is very comforting to hear when that\u2019s the venue I\u2019ve booked. The groom is incorrect, too, because he has an opinion about his own wedding.\n\nMy feelings of inadequacy at this bridal business are helped along by the fact my entire identity seems to revolve around it now. People refer me to as \u201cthe future Mrs. Whitney,\u201d which makes me want to jab them in the eyes with a fork, especially as I\u2019m going to combine our names and be Elsmere-Whitney. I\u2019ll also keep using Ms. My fianc\u00e9 is also planning to use both names, but that\u2019s a whole other story of baffled reactions.

They look pitying when I don\u2019t have anything new to tell them.\n\nThank God for sensible friends and family who ask how it\u2019s going, but don\u2019t forget I have a personality outside of \u201cbride,\u201d or I think I\u2019d have gone on a murdering spree.

She represents the state that saw the most lynchings during the Jim Crow era, and her remarks have reminded many of the power white women held during that reign of terror.\n\nIn 1955, when Carolyn Bryant lied and said that a 14-year-old Emmett Till had whistled at her, Till was murdered by her husband and brother-in-law.\n\nHyde-Smith has doubled down on her comment and refused to apologize. Her remarks do not merely reflect the excesses of partisanship in the U.S. midterm elections, nor are they the result of mere tribalism or polarization. This is white supremacy, upheld with the help of the actual and threatened violence of white women. This white supremacy exists in mainstream political elections, in extremist movements, and in more soft-core white savior configurations that are no less deadly.\n\nThe image that most people conjure when they think of \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d is of a man in a Klan robe or marching at Charlottesville carrying a Tiki torch. And if we think of women upholding white supremacy at all, it is in the angry faces of women who opposed integration in the 1950s and busing in the 1970s.\n\nBut the truth is that white women have always been ardent proponents of violent white supremacy, and they continue to be some of its most vocal advocates.\n\nWhite women have always been ardent proponents of violent white supremacy, and they continue to be some of its most vocal advocates.\n\nThe current faces of white supremacy are women like YouTube stars Lana Lokteff and Faith Goldy. Lokteff creates videos that are meant to appeal to white women and push forward a violent white supremacy. Her videos feature titles such as \u201cPro White is Pro-Woman. Feminism is Anti-White\u201d and \u201cWomen and the Alt-Right: The Awakened White Female.\u201d Her message about the fall of \u201cwhite civilization\u201d and the urgent need to establish a white ethnostate reaches some 145,000 subscribers in the U.S. and beyond.\n\nGoldy, whose channel has more than 82,000 subscribers, came in third in a recent race for mayor of Toronto. She describes herself as a \u201cwhite nationalist,\u201d and she sees a bright electoral future for those who share her views. \u201cIn the next five to 10 years, probably closer to five, we will have alt-right men and women running for political office,\u201d Goldy recently told a cheering audience of neo-Nazis. Although she is Canadian, her views resonate with white nationalists in the U.S. and have earned her the endorsement of the recently re-elected member of U.S. Congress, Steve King (R-Iowa).\n\nWhile it may be easy to dismiss the YouTube rants of white women like Goldy and Lokteff, it is harder to discount the institutional violence that white women can deploy. When women who believe in establishing a white ethnostate get the opportunity to wield state power, it means the destruction of actual people\u2019s lives.\n\nRichard Lautens via Getty Images Toronto mayoral candidate Faith Goldy and some of her supporters protested outside a mayoral debate to which she was not invited.\n\nFor example, Kirstjen Nielsen is the white woman currently presiding over prison camps of children whose families have fled brutal violence in Central America. While Nielsen is rumored to be on her way out of the administration, she continues to hold power over the fate of children who are experiencing an extreme version of institutionalized racism that is also a form of child abuse.\n\nThe American College of Physicians issued a statement strongly objecting to family separation, noting the kind of psychological and emotional distress it inflicts on the very young. \u201cChildhood trauma and adverse childhood experiences create negative health impacts that will last an individual\u2019s entire lifespan. Separating a child from his or her parents triggers a level of stress consistent with trauma.\u201d The time children spend in these camps will affect them for the rest of their lives, and the administrative office doing this violence is led by a white woman.\n\nCamps for children, YouTube videos and threats of \u201cpublic hangings\u201d by sitting senators are not the only forms of violence perpetrated by white women. This violence comes in more subtle, suburban forms, too.\n\nThis violence comes in more subtle, suburban forms, too.\n\nIn April, 2018 Jennifer Hart drove her wife and her adoptive children, who were black, off a cliff in Northern California, killing them. While the crime shocked most people, and a handful of accounts at the time urged people to not ignore the role of race in the story, few connected Hart\u2019s actions to the broader violence of white women\u2019s supremacy. But the entire story of Hart\u2019s family\u2019s annihilation is riddled with it.\n\nWhen Hannah Hart, then 16, ran to a neighbor\u2019s house in the middle of the night in 2017 a year before the tragedy, she pleaded with them. \u201cYou gotta help,\u201d she begged. \u201cPlease protect me! Don\u2019t make me go back! They\u2019re racists, and they abuse us!\u201d She was referring to Jen and Sarah Hart, her adoptive parents. Despite repeated calls for help to neighbors, strangers and social service agencies, no one did anything to protect Hannah and her siblings because, as one representative of child protective services explained, \u201cthe problem is these women look normal.\u201d\n\nIn other words, because they were white, the reports of abuse were dismissed. The white savior impulse of \u201cI want to help you\u201d can lead white parents to adopt black children, and films like \u201dThe Blind Side\u201d reinforce this as a feel-good solution to racial inequality.\n\nBut the reality is that transracial adoption is entangled with the violence of ownership and annihilation, and there is a long history of it in the U.S. The Indian Adoption Project was a federal program that meant that as many as one-third of Native American children were separated from their families and sent to live with white families between 1941 and 1967. In 1972, the National Association of Black Social Workers issued a statement declaring transracial adoption of black children a form of \u201dcultural and racial genocide.\u201d And today, there is grave concern that the children currently detained by the U.S. government and separated from their parents are at risk of being permanently stolen from their true families via adoption by white families. While draped in the language of care for children, it is an efficient means of depriving children of their culture.\n\nWe have to face up to the hard-edged reality of the violence of white women\u2019s supremacy.\n\nAlthough the violence of white women\u2019s supremacy is perhaps easiest to see in Sen. Hyde-Smith\u2019s reference to a public hanging or in the YouTube videos of people like Faith Goldy and Lana Lokteff, who both manage to put a thin, conventionally feminine face on their ugly beliefs, it also resides in the Harts\u2019 adoption and abuse of six black children and the failure of Minnesota child protective services. And white women\u2019s violent supremacy is riven through Jen Hart\u2019s decision to speed her SUV over a cliff at nearly 100 miles an hour, killing her entire family.\n\nAs pundits sift through the detritus of the midterms, we\u2019ve learned that a majority of white women voted Republican in crucial races in Texas, Georgia and Florida. The hot takes that claim these women are voting against their own interests miss the fact that upholding white supremacy does, in fact, serve white women\u2019s interest in whiteness. While some observers will offer soft-focused reactions to white women\u2019s voting records as our collective \u201dsisterhood problem,\u201d we have to face up to the hard-edged reality of the violence of white women\u2019s supremacy.\n\nWhite women\u2019s violent supremacy has deep roots in the American landscape, and it is a violence they have enacted shoulder-to-shoulder with their white brothers, husbands and sons.\n\nIf we are to be able to grapple with white supremacy, let alone dismantle it, we must recognize that when white women vote or wield political power in ways that support white supremacy, or post racist YouTube videos, or acquire, abuse and then annihilate black children, they are in fact, upholding white supremacy. If we are to end white supremacy, we must contend with its violent, feminine forms.\n\nJessie Daniels is a Professor at The City University Of New York, and the author of the forthcoming book Tweetstorm: The Rise of the \u201cAlt-Right\u201d and the Mainstreaming of White Nationalism."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Kimberly Yam", "title": "Asian-Americans Favored Democrats By Far In Midterms: Exit Poll", "description": "\u201cAttacks on immigrants and racist rhetoric, increasingly aimed at Asian immigrants and Asian-Americans, had some harmful consequences for the Republican Party.\"", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/asian-american-exit-poll-midterms-2018_us_5beda96de4b03af89267ef89", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bef722a1d0000e50131331f.jpeg?cache=pO88DyY0sm&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T13:00:13Z", "content": "Data show that Asian-Americans are continuing to trend left.

The survey found that the group overwhelmingly favored Democratic candidates.\n\nIt also showed that the lion\u2019s share of Asian-Americans disapproved of Donald Trump\u2019s performance as president and did not support candidates who embraced Trump and his policies.\n\nJerry Vattamala, democracy program director at AALDEF, told HuffPost that Trump\u2019s policies have distanced many Asian-Americans who immigrated through visas for high-skilled workers or via family-based immigration.\n\n\u201cAttacks on immigrants and racist rhetoric, increasingly aimed at Asian immigrants and Asian-Americans, had some harmful consequences for the Republican Party,\u201d he told HuffPost.\n\nThe exit poll, conducted in English as well as 11 Asian languages, was taken in 50 cities in 14 states. The poll revealed that in both Senate and gubernatorial races, Asian-Americans supported Democratic candidates at levels far higher than overall voters did. Asian-Americans\u2019 preference for Democratic candidates was corroborated by The New York Times\u2019 exit poll data that show the group has swung further left than any other racial group.\n\nIn Texas, 64 percent of Asian-Americans voted for Democratic Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, who secured about 48 percent of the overall votes. About a third of the Asian community voted for Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who won with about 51 percent of the vote.\n\nIn the Georgia gubernatorial race, Asian-American voters supported Democrat Stacey Abrams at more than 80 percent while only 15 percent supported Republican candidate Brian Kemp.\n\nWhen looking at the Michigan governor\u2019s race, more than 90 percent of Asian-American voters supported Democratic candidate Gretchen Whitmer, who won with about 53 percent of the state\u2019s vote. Only 7 percent of the group voted for Republican candidate Bill Schuette.\n\nVattamala told HuffPost that the number of survey responses had doubled since the last election in 2016, indicating that Asian-American turnout has risen significantly. An exit poll from the AAPI Civic Engagement Fund also found that Asian-Americans had \u201cunprecedented levels of civic engagement and voter mobilization,\u201d Taeku Lee, managing director of Asian American Decisions, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt seems that voters were determined to make their voices heard and their opposition to Donald Trump and his anti-immigrant policies,\u201d Vattamala told HuffPost.\n\nThe group did encounter several barriers to their civic engagement on election day, the AALDEF exit poll noted, including encountering voting machine breakdowns, being directed to incorrect polling sites, being denied provisional ballots and access to language assistance, and facing demands for proof of identification and citizenship when it was not legally required.\n\nHistorically, the largest voting challenges the group has faced included the high rate of limited English proficiency, which affects about one-third of the Asian-American population. Almost 77 percent of Asian-Americans speak a language besides English at home. According to demographic data and the policy organization AAPI Data, many Asian immigrants rely on their children to translate materials for the voting process.\n\nInformation on voters with limited English proficiency has also been sorely lacking, and the group has long been excluded from mainstream polling, so often data on Asian-American voters aren\u2019t quite so accurate. For example, though Edison Research found that 65 percent of Asian-Americans voted for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, AALDEF\u2019s poll in Asian languages revealed the 79 percent of the group voted for her.\n\nVattamala added that by polling in a variety of languages, \u201cwe can capture this crucial data from voters that are always overlooked and ignored by the mainstream media and the parties and candidates as well.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Claire Fallon", "title": "\u2018The Holiday Calendar\u2019 Is Even More Enjoyably Mediocre Than \u2018A Christmas Prince\u2019", "description": "The latest streaming holiday flick is your classic boy-meets-girl, girl-gets-magic-calendar tale.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/netflix-the-holiday-calendar_us_5bef3bf2e4b0f32bd5899aa6", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bef44aa2000005e060293f3.jpeg?ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T13:00:13Z", "content": "Warning: Spoilers below!

But today, we\u2019re here to talk about an arguably more essential cultural event: the Netflix original movie \u201cThe Holiday Calendar.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Holiday Calendar\u201d is a timeless tale, providing an answer to the eternal question: What would happen if an Advent calendar began predicting the future and changed your life? What if a religious timekeeper helped you fall in love and start a business with your best friend?\n\nStarring Kat Graham and Quincy Brown, \u201cThe Holiday Calendar\u201d follows Abby, a struggling photographer who is spending the Christmas season taking pictures of kids on Santa\u2019s lap at a local holiday market. Her old best friend, Josh, has been traveling the world taking photographs and dating cool people, but he\u2019s returned to town and is eager to rekindle their friendship ... at least. Then Abby meets Ty (Ethan Peck), a sexy doctor who begins to court her \u2015 and all the while, a magical holiday calendar Abby\u2019s grandma left to her has been predicting their meet-cutes and dates. It seems like her Christmas miracle is finally here!\n\nBecause Claire is a bonafide holiday movie fiend who would inject Christmas magic into her veins if she could, and Priscilla was very hungover last week and watched \u201cThe Holiday Calendar\u201d twice, they had a lot to say to each other about this festive flirt-fest.\n\nPriscilla: Hello, ho, ho, Claire! It is an honor to discuss \u201cThe Holiday Calendar\u201d with you, given your status as a true connoisseur of holiday rom-coms. So tell me, what do you love about the genre?\n\nClaire: Yes, the Hallmark watcher has logged on! It is I! One thing I really like about the genre is watching them with you while drinking hot cider. I am exactly the cheesy Christmas-loving winter fanatic that these seasonal films depict, and we all love to watch gorgeous versions of ourselves onscreen.\n\nMore to the point, I love that holiday rom-coms either work as romantic comedies, which is my favorite type of movie, or they fail in a hilariously extreme way that reveals a fundamental insufficiency to the task, much like this ferret trying to leap between tables. For example, I recently watched one in which a woman travels all the way to New York from Boston to get in touch with a ballet dancer she thinks is engaged to her amnesiac patient. This is the era of email and social media, but nice try at creating a plausible plot beat.\n\nBut let\u2019s talk about this new Netflix offering, which I believe falls into the \u201csuccess\u201d end of the spectrum. I found it to be a more elevated version of what you might find on the Hallmark channel. Do you agree?\n\nPriscilla: To be honest, I haven\u2019t watched a Hallmark holiday movie since we binged on them together last year in the spirit of journalism. (Another shameless plug for our story.) So when I watched THC, I wouldn\u2019t say \u201celevated\u201d is the word that came to mind.\n\nI\u2019m thinking about the very first scene in the movie, when Abby, our heroine, is working her unfulfilling day job as a photographer for a cheesy holiday studio and her long-lost, hot best friend Josh, freshly back from \u201cfinding his voice\u201d in Europe, comes in to surprise her.\n\nHe enters the studio and takes a seat in front of the backdrop as Abby runs through the studio\u2019s canned spiel about passport photos without realizing it\u2019s him. When she finally sees him through the lens of her camera she exclaims \u201cJosh!\u201d and gallops over for a huge hug. It\u2019s just so wonderfully stupid and unrealistic that she wouldn\u2019t notice him when he walked in. Or that he wouldn\u2019t call or text his best friend to say he\u2019s moving home??\n\nI mean, these implausibilities pale in comparison to the central conceit of the film, that Abby is gifted a magical Advent calendar that predicts the future. If you were in Abby\u2019s situation, at what point would you start thinking, OK, I didn\u2019t think magic was real, but it looks like this antique calendar is controlling my life now?\n\nClaire: Their chemistry and genuine warmth, in this scene, is on a level I have yet to see in a made-for-TV holiday movie. I was seduced! Enraptured! I wanted to watch them put their mouths together from the very first moment! I think the point is that she is really going through the motions with this job, so numbed by it that she\u2019s not even seeing the world around her \u2015 although this is exactly what her photographer\u2019s spirit should be calling her to do. And if you think a guy wanting to surprise his friend with his return home is implausible, I am impressed at the caliber of the movies you\u2019ve been watching.\n\nBut let\u2019s back up a bit: Abby and Josh were best friends growing up and they got into photography together. Since then, he\u2019s traveled the world as a travel blogger and photographer, while she\u2019s been grinding away at this uninspiring job. But he\u2019s back, maybe for good, just in time for Christmas!\n\nThat night, at her family\u2019s tree-decorating gathering, her grandfather gives her a gift: her late grandmother\u2019s antique wooden Advent calendar. She thinks it\u2019s broken because she can\u2019t open the doors, but instead, the doors start opening on their own every night, revealing little wooden toys. And then ... the toys start predicting the future! In the morning, the calendar gives her boots; later that day, Josh gives her a pair of cute Italian booties. Magic!\n\nI have to say, I don\u2019t think I would ever attribute this to supernatural forces. Would you?\n\nPriscilla: Most definitely, day one. I would be proselytizing in Candy Cane Square by day four. Although, now that I think of it, since all of the toys popping out of this calendar are Christmas-centric, and Abby is living in a small town that\u2019s obsessed with Christmas and working as a damn elf, it seems probable that she\u2019d encounter nutcrackers, carolers, Christmas trees and the like on a daily basis.\n\nLet\u2019s return to Abby and Josh though, because as an Art Critic, I have to talk about their Art. Josh is the one pursuing his dreams as a travel blog photographer, traveling around ~hostels~ in ~Europe~. (Also, we must take a minute to honor his amazing circa 2006 skinny scarf, the likes of which I haven\u2019t seen since the popular girls at my high school rocked matching ones.) Abby, on the other hand, is stuck in her humdrum day job taking studio holiday portraits, too scared to pursue her dream career of taking studio portraits not for the holidays. At one point, Josh comes to her (bizarrely fancy) studio apartment and sees her photography work, essentially black-and-white photos of shadows, I think?\n\nWhat did you think of Abby\u2019s photography? Does she have what it takes to make it in the art world? Would you ever date a \u201ctravel blog photographer\u201d? Does such a thing even exist?\n\nClaire: Priscilla, you are the art critic in this conversation! Her shadow photos sort of reminded me of a time in high school photography class when I took a photo of the river near my house and the flash reflected against a branch, which showed up white against the rest of the photo. I thought this was Very Arty. I think I even submitted it for a local student art competition, in which I Did Not Place. But what do you think?\n\nI would totally date a travel blog photographer, and from the little I know of the industry, I do think it\u2019s possible to make money as a travel blogger and freelance photographer. I follow people on Instagram who live high on the hog by taking photos of themselves drinking latt\u00e9s in silk pleated skirts, so I don\u2019t see why not.\n\nPriscilla: I love the photos, they are the visual equivalent of my favorite poem in first grade, \u201cMy Shadow\u201d by Robert Louis Stevenson, about how we all have shadows that follow us wherever we do, like ghostly stalkers. The one of the kid jumping on the pogo stick is especially haunting. It\u2019s like, the shadows are the ghosts of our childhood, reminding us of time\u2019s fleeting nature before it\u2019s too late, you know? (*Hits bong.*) I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what Abby was trying to communicate.\n\nClaire: Dang, that\u2019s beautiful. Honestly, anything is art if you look at it the right way, that\u2019s my position.\n\nPriscilla, it\u2019s time to talk about Ty, the second gorgeous hunk of man to swoon over Abby in this film. One day, the Advent calendar shows Abby a Christmas tree, and that night, an ineptly tied Christmas tree falls from Ty\u2019s car into the path of Abby\u2019s. They meet, sparks fly; they exchange some actually witty banter about murdering evergreens, which I enjoyed. He is insanely handsome, a single dad, and a doctor, and he ends up pursuing Abby through over-the-top dates and gifts. Do you think Ty was possibly too perfect for an also-ran love interest?\n\nNetflix Suave Ty (Ethan Peck) romances photographer Abby (Kat Graham).\n\nPriscilla: Oh Ty, what a hot potato! I think they messed up in making him too sexy for his own good. He looks like Dominic West circa \u201cChicago,\u201d is a single dad who sews his daughter handmade dance costumes, and, God forbid, takes Abby on cute dates!\n\nThe narrative was that his dates were so over the top Abby felt like he was putting on a show, but I call bullshit. Going to dinner, drinking hot chocolate, riding the trolley, ice skating \u2015 those sweet (if not totally age-appropriate) dates that you can definitely get to know someone during. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s Christian Grey chartering a copter for the night or something. And their chemistry was hot as hell. I thought they were about to make sweet Christmas love on that fallen Xmas tree.\n\nI was sad they broke up, although that was one of my favorite scenes. Abby makes the bold choice to tell her new beau she owns a Christmas calendar with magic powers, and he is understandably skeptical. Then she gets furious and breaks up with him. Clearly, he\u2019s shocked their love story came to an end because of an antique, and he\u2019s all \u201cwhatever.\u201d Later, however, Ty comes to his senses and apologizes for not taking her calendar more seriously. I worry that Grandpa accidentally ruined Abby\u2019s life with this gift, prompting her to break things off with a sexy doctor for an Instagram influencer who\u2019s too scared to make a move.\n\nClaire: Ty is soooo dreamy. It felt like they had to throw the emergency brake to bring the romance to a screeching halt. That said, in retrospect, I am suspicious of Ty. What single dad has time for nightly lavish dates with a woman he barely knows? (I say this as someone whose dad was dating while raising us \u2015 once a week was about all he could manage.) Apparently, he\u2019s sewing his kid dance uniforms but hiring a babysitter to make her dinner every single night so he can get laid. I was firmly on his side during the Advent calendar break-up, however: Abby can\u2019t stand even a moment\u2019s light teasing about the fact that she believes a wooden calendar is predicting the future? Chill, lady. Accept that you are insane. As you mentioned before, this calendar\u2019s \u201cpredictions\u201d are along the lines of, \u201cYou will encounter a Christmas tree today,\u201d which, given that she is spending all day in a Christmas village taking Santa photos, is weak. Ty compares it to a horoscope reading, and he is correct.\n\nPriscilla: There was one other factor that led to the couple\u2019s eventual disintegration: the soup kitchen visit. Ty takes Abby to a soup kitchen, saying he volunteers there all the time. Then two men living there tell Abby he\u2019s full of shit and takes women there to show off. I feel like ... this is fine! Everyone volunteers for selfish reasons and it\u2019s the action that counts more than the intention. What are your thoughts on #soupgate?\n\nClaire: The soup kitchen! We diverge sharply on this point. I think Ty is full of shit. It\u2019s certainly better to volunteer than not, but SHE is supposed to be getting to know HIM. For her purposes, it\u2019s extremely relevant whether she\u2019s choosing to be with a guy who is passionate about charity or whether she\u2019s falling for his slick pick-up gimmick. He told her he takes his daughter there once a month, and instead, it turns out he only comes with hot dates now and then. It\u2019s also telling that he twice dismisses the idea of getting to know the people who visit the soup kitchen, even mocking the idea that she might take relationship advice from guys who \u201clive on the street.\u201d Disrespectful, my man.\n\nTo return to the holiday calendar for a moment, it\u2019s just occurred to me that the whole central conceit of the movie is ... irrelevant? I don\u2019t see how it affected any part of the plot. She happened to meet a hot guy, they date, they turn out to be incompatible, and she realizes she\u2019s in love with her best friend; the Advent calendar might \u201cpredict\u201d parts of this, but doesn\u2019t seem to influence it. Is \u201cThe Holiday Calendar\u201d flawed at its core?\n\nPriscilla: Sadly, I think so, but that only contributes to this movie\u2019s deranged greatness. The Advent calendar is clearly dabbling with some occult shit, and the spirits aren\u2019t always on your side! I mean, Abby was almost smushed to death by a candy cane. She should know better than to blindly trust her magic toys. And how did her grandma die again anyway?! But the real love story here is between Abby and Father Christmas. She starts out a grinch and ends up addicted to that holiday cheer.\n\nObviously, my next question is, what does Abby\u2019s grandpa (Ron Cephas Jones) \u2015 who gifted her the cursed box \u2015 know? Is he to be trusted?\n\nClaire: I don\u2019t trust Gramps! By the end, it seems like he\u2019s scheming to get her together with Josh \u2015 which happens to be cute because she\u2019s into Josh, too, but what if she weren\u2019t? What if your grandpa kept trying to manipulate you into dating your high school buddy when all you wanted was to get swept off your feet by a chiseled doctor?\n\nBut Josh needs the help because the road hasn\u2019t been easy. When Abby meets Ty before Josh has a chance to make his move, he backs off and pines for a while (I am a sucker for pining; bear with me). She even stands him up at the movies because her date with the doc runs overtime. Then he manages to get her fired \u2015 by accident, of course \u2015 and suddenly the two aren\u2019t even speaking. If you were Abby, would you give Josh a shot after all this?\n\nPriscilla: It doesn\u2019t seem like there are too many dating options in their small town, so I guess if Josh is hot and single (and willing to buy me an art gallery), I would be down. But I would consult with the Advent calendar first, of course.\n\nThis movie was full of silly, cheesy, cringeworthy moments, as holiday movies are. What was your favorite?\n\nClaire: I loved so many moments in this movie, and for that, I have to give credit to the cast, especially Kat Graham. She\u2019s sparkling, she has a gorgeous, expressive face, and she has chemistry with every character, including the Advent calendar. Watching her be longed for and pursued was so much fun for me. I loved Abby\u2019s cheesy bit with Josh, where he pretends to take snapshots of her (shades of Jim and Pam\u2019s wedding in \u201cThe Office\u201d).\n\nBut the most ridiculous touch, for me, was at the last moment, when the camera zooms out on the photography gallery he co-bought for them while they were still in a fight (which, what??). The gallery is called ... Magic Calendar Gallery. I mean! She specifically wanted this business in order to do her own, tasteful, art photography, and then she gave it the kind of name that says, \u201cCome on in for all your scented candle and Santa tchotchke needs.\u201d A gallery named \u201cMagic Calendar\u201d should sell only knockoffs of Thomas Kinkade paintings. A very made-for-TV holiday movie choice. What about you?\n\nPriscilla: I love when initially Abby thinks her Advent calendar is broken because none of the little doors open \u2015 obviously, before she learns it\u2019s magic \u2015 and she says \u201cThanks, Gram\u201d in this wonderfully salty way. Like, \u201cthanks a lot for this broke-ass calendar, dead grandma!\u201d I also love the detail that Josh is literally always eating cookies when he\u2019s onscreen. This way, we know he has that big Xmas energy. But what kind of grown man is always, always scarfing down cookies? I do not know him and I do not care to.\n\nClaire: I wish my husband were always eating cookies. It really hurts my feelings that I have to eat them all myself.\n\nBut WAIT, I just remembered the most important moment in the whole film: When Abby, deep in a post-breakup and post-firing funk, cues up a roster of Netflix romantic comedies on her TV, including \u201cThe Christmas Prince\u201d and \u201cA Christmas Inheritance.\u201d The image takes up nearly the whole shot, which created the startling effect that for a moment I thought I had clicked back to the Netflix menu myself. It\u2019s the least subtle product placement since \u201cMorning Joe\u201d partnered with Starbucks. (And trust me, anyone who is watching \u201cThe Holiday Calendar\u201d already knows about \u201cThe Christmas Prince.\u201d)\n\nPriscilla: Apparently they do it in \u201cA Princess Switch,\u201d too! One of the Vanessa Hudgenses is watching \u201cThe Christmas Switch\u201d in the movie. It\u2019s like \u201cThe Human Centipede\u201d of Netflix holiday flicks!\n\nClaire: Netflix, you\u2019re drunk.\n\nAny parting thoughts on this latest addition to the holiday romantic comedy canon?\n\nPriscilla: My parting thought is ... I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves cheesy holiday love stories or to an arch nemesis who is only into pretentious documentaries. It will inspire you to bone your best friend and wear a skinny scarf like you\u2019re Ashlee Simpson in the early aughts.\n\nClaire: No one has ever needed to inspire me to do the first, and nothing will ever inspire me to do the latter!\n\nPriscilla: What about you? Would you recommend?\n\nClaire: I recommend that anyone who enjoys a cozy night of romance check this movie out. Make a plate of sugar cookies. Put on a fluffy robe. Buy a commercial space for your crush and text them about it coyly.

Her 6-year-old son had been removed from her care for more than a month. She was forced to close an in-home child care business, and she\u2019d been temporarily displaced from her preschool teaching job, which she\u2019d held for 17 years. Her teenage daughter refused to talk to the 6-year-old, blaming him for the family\u2019s troubles.\n\nBanks didn\u2019t blame her little boy. She blamed his school, and the investigators from the state\u2019s child welfare agency they\u2019d sent to her door.\n\nUntil last fall, Banks had only good things to say about her children\u2019s school. She\u2019d carefully chosen the K-8 institution, a magnet school across town from her single-family house on Chicago\u2019s West Side, for its academic rigor and diverse student body. Her daughter, now 16, had thrived there, she said, and her middle son did well too. But when her youngest son entered first grade last year, he started misbehaving and making trouble for teachers. \u201cHe really struggles behavior-wise,\u201d said Banks, a tall, self-assured woman who\u2019d attended neighborhood public schools in Chicago and desperately wanted something different for her kids. \u201cAnd at this school they have a low tolerance for it.\u201d\n\nThe school wanted the boy to enroll in classes exclusively for students with disabilities. But Banks felt differently: Despite his behavior problems, for which he was eventually diagnosed with attention deficit and mood disorders, he did well academically, she said. Banks pushed back, going so far as to make complaints to the city\u2019s education board and entering mediation with the school.\n\nThis was unfolding around the time the workers from the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, or DCFS, began investigating her for alleged child abuse and neglect.\n\nSchool employees in most states have a legal obligation to report any suspicion of abuse and neglect, and they can play a critical role in helping keep children out of harm\u2019s way. But in nearly three dozen interviews conducted by The Hechinger Report and HuffPost, parents, lawyers, advocates and child welfare officials said that schools occasionally wield this authority in inappropriate ways. Fed up with what they see as obstinate parents who don\u2019t agree to special education services for their child, or disruptive kids who make learning difficult, schools sometimes use the threat of a child-protection investigation to strong-arm parents into complying with the school\u2019s wishes or transferring their children to a new school. That approach is not only improper, but it can be devastating for families, even if the allegations are ultimately determined to be unfounded.\n\nBanks\u2019 first brush with DCFS came after the school sent her son to the hospital because he was acting out, she said. They wanted him to receive a psychiatric evaluation, she said, but Banks refused because he already had an appointment with his doctor for the following week. The second time a caseworker investigated her, she said, it was because her son\u2019s doctor had prescribed him a new medication and the school hadn\u2019t been properly notified. Next came an investigation after her middle child wrote a paper that Banks was told contained troubling content. One time, she gave her youngest son a spanking for running away from school. After he told school employees about it the next day, he was removed from her home for more than a month and sent to live with her sister-in-law while the child welfare agency investigated her for abuse, according to Banks. The most recent case was the most incomprehensible to her: Banks said she was investigated for letting her middle child go to school with a bad haircut he\u2019d given himself. The haircut, Banks said she was told by an investigator, could amount to emotional abuse.\n\nAs a teacher, Banks herself had sometimes called the state child welfare hotline over the years, when she worried that her students were being abused or neglected. But in her case, she believes the school simply wanted her son gone. Banks said she\u2019d heard from a handful of other parents who\u2019d found themselves in similar situations, all of whom are African-American like her and whose children have disabilities. \u201cAll I\u2019m looking for is a good education for my kid,\u201d said Banks. She felt the allegations against her had been twisted and exaggerated to fit a narrative that she was a bad mother. \u201cIt severed the relationship that we\u2019re supposed to have as a parent and teacher community.\u201d\n\nCalling ACS is one of the tools in [a school\u2019s] repertoire to make the parents comply. Irene Mendez, a staff attorney with New York Lawyers for the Public Interest\n\nEmily Bolton, a spokesperson for the Chicago Public Schools, wrote in an email that the agency cannot comment on specific cases but that employees take seriously their responsibility as mandated reporters of abuse and neglect, and that there is no evidence of widespread misuse of the DCFS child-welfare hotline.\n\nBut even some former child welfare officials say the practice isn\u2019t as rare as they\u2019d like. \u201cIf schools don\u2019t get the parents to agree to what\u2019s being recommended \u2014 not all the time, but sometimes \u2014 they will call ACS [the Administration for Children\u2019s Services, New York City\u2019s child welfare agency] to pressure them,\u201d said Don Lash, a former lawyer with ACS and author of the book, \u201c \u2018When the Welfare People Come\u2019: Race and Class in the US Child Protection System.\u201d\n\nHe and many other experts also note that because of legitimate fears of overlooking kids at risk and vague definitions of abuse and neglect, school workers may sometimes be overzealous, calling in allegations over relatively minor issues such as broken eyeglasses, inappropriate clothing or small scratches. In interviews, more than a dozen lawyers said these investigations disproportionately affect low-income families of color, who tend to live in neighborhoods and attend schools that have bigger police and social services presences and whose children are more likely to show markings of poverty that can be confused with neglect.\n\nSuch families also have fewer resources to fight back. When a family in a wealthy Brooklyn neighborhood learned roughly two years ago that their child\u2019s school had initiated an ACS investigation against them, they sued the city education department. Parents from lower-income, majority-black and Latino neighborhoods, few of whom can afford that option, say such investigations can be a regular, even expected, part of parenting. According to ACS data, there were 2,391 abuse and neglect investigations last year in East New York/Starrett City, a low-income neighborhood in Brooklyn, compared with 255 in the affluent, and far more populous, Upper East Side.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can think of a white family where I\u2019ve ever seen it arise,\u201d Chris Gottlieb, co-director of New York University\u2019s Family Defense Clinic, which represents clients in child welfare cases, said of these types of school-driven investigations.\n\nAn Intimidation Tool?\n\nAccusations that officials with Success Academy Charter Schools have sometimes threatened parents with ACS involvement have been a focal point of legal and civil complaints against the charter school network, New York City\u2019s largest. One lawsuit against a Success Academy school in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn alleges that the school unfairly singled out kids with disabilities for discipline. In an August ruling allowing the suit to proceed, a judge said allegations that school employees called police or child protective services on 4- and 5-year olds, would, if true, help to demonstrate enough \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d to sustain the discrimination claims.\n\nNicey Givens, one of the parents in the suit, said she was told at least twice that Success might involve ACS if she didn\u2019t quickly pick up her child from school in the middle of the day. The boy, who\u2019d been given diagnoses of attention deficit and oppositional defiant disorder, often misbehaved, and Givens said she felt the school was pressuring her to remove him. Once, she said, the threat to involve ACS came after she\u2019d sent the boy to school in boots instead of his uniform shoes on a cold, wet day.\n\nOur focus is always on the student, the child. Not to say that the parent doesn\u2019t matter and those kinds of investigations can\u2019t be awkward and disruptive, but it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry, and there are just too many examples that you read of something that was overlooked. Ann Powell, executive vice president of public affairs, Success Academy charter network\n\n\u201cCalling ACS is one of the tools in their repertoire to make the parents comply,\u201d said Irene Mendez, a staff attorney with New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, one of several groups that filed the suit. A 2016 civil complaint filed with the federal Department of Education includes an allegation that a Success school in Manhattan initiated an ACS investigation against the mother of a 6-year-old as part of an effort to encourage her to send him to another school. Another lawsuit alleges that one of the network\u2019s Bronx schools repeatedly threatened to call ACS to pressure a parent to remove her son from the school.\n\nSuccess Academy officials dispute the suggestion that any of the network\u2019s schools misuse calls to ACS. Ann Powell, executive vice president of public affairs for the charter network, said she could not comment on the specifics in the lawsuit involving the Fort Greene school because it is ongoing, but said that the network disagreed with the way Givens described her interactions with the school. Success also disputes the allegations made against the Manhattan and Bronx schools. Powell noted that as legally mandated reporters of child abuse, school employees must report any suspicion of abuse and neglect, and that \u201cusing that in a threatening way is just not credible.\u201d\n\nDamon Dahlen/HuffPost The Hankinses with their son David. A family court judge rejected the New York City Department of Education\u2019s allegation that the couple had neglected their child by keeping him out of school and having \u201cunrealistic expectations\u201d for his education.\n\nA Legal Obligation\n\nMandated reporter laws date to the 1960s, and in most states, school employees are among the professionals (along with doctors, social workers and others) obligated to report any suspicion of abuse or neglect. Mandated reporter trainings remind school employees that it\u2019s not their responsibility to decide whether abuse is taking place but simply to pick up the phone if they have a concern, and the child welfare agency will take over from there. Mandated reporters typically have immunity from prosecution for making needless calls, so long as those calls are made in good faith.\n\n\u201cAll of the pressure on mandated reporters is to report, report, report,\u201d said Richard Wexler, executive director of the nonprofit National Coalition for Child Protection Reform.\n\nIf they fail to report their suspicions, and something terrible happens to the child, they can face fines or even jail time and wind up on the front page of a newspaper. Child welfare is often described as being caught in a scandal-reform cycle, with reports of neglect and entrances to foster care rising after high-profile child deaths. Both Chicago and New York are dealing with the repercussions of recent scandals \u2014 Chicago Tribune reporting on sex abuse in schools is spurring fresh resources and protocols, while in New York, calls to the child abuse hotline spiked after the deaths of two young boys under ACS monitoring in 2016.\n\n\u201cOur focus is always on the student, the child,\u201d said Powell, the Success Academy VP. \u201cNot to say that the parent doesn\u2019t matter and those kinds of investigations can\u2019t be awkward and disruptive, but it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry, and there are just too many examples that you read of something that was overlooked.\u201d\n\nSchool officials also note that they have a unique responsibility in policing child neglect in many states. Child welfare laws in New York and 23 other states (not Illinois) list the denial of education as a form of abuse or neglect. In some parts of New York, school employees are required to initiate educational neglect allegations if a child has a prolonged absence and parents don\u2019t respond to the school. Last year, school personnel in New York City made 16,301 reports to ACS, more than any other type of mandated reporter, according to agency data provided to Hechinger/HuffPost. Of those, about 43 percent involved an allegation of educational neglect.\n\nBut critics say these too are misused or fall into gray areas of the law. Phillip and Tina Hankins, a couple in the South Bronx, have been tussling with the New York City Department of Education for more than a decade over where and how to educate their son David, who has a disability. They\u2019ve been investigated at least seven times by ACS, including on occasions when they kept David out of class while fighting to get him into what they considered to be a more suitable institution, documentation shows.\n\n\u201cThe schools have the right to call in whatever they think is not appropriate,\u201d said Baffour Acheampong, an ACS worker who investigated several of the Hankins\u2019 cases. \u201cBut in dealing with Mrs. and Mr. Hankins, what I saw was they have the best interests of their son.\u201d\n\nOn the one occasion that ACS substantiated an educational neglect allegation against the Hankinses, a family court judge later overturned that finding. The judge noted that David\u2019s intelligence test scores actually improved when the boy was kept out of school awaiting placement, and that the Hankinses had been doing all they could to fight for educational services. \u201cIn light of the Appellants\u2019 year-long battle to get the child into an appropriate school, it is not clear what else they could have done to have enrolled David,\u201d the judge wrote, adding that the agency did not provide a \u201csingle credible instance where they failed to exercise the required minimum degree of care.\u201d\n\nIn response to questions about this case, spokesperson for the New York City schools Miranda Barbot said that the Department of Education works \u201cclosely with families to support them,\u201d and \u201cwhen there is reasonable cause to suspect abuse or neglect, we have clear policies in place that ensure it is reported.\u201d\n\nMichael Arsham, executive director of ACS\u2019s Office of Advocacy, which responds to complaints from those involved in the child welfare system, said the agency acknowledges that hotline calls from schools do not always contain serious safety concerns, and it is working more closely with the education department to minimize needless reporting. Two years ago, ACS developed a \u201ctiered response\u201d system with the DOE to prioritize urgent matters and reduce the impact on families of investigations over smaller concerns. \u201cWe do want people to call potential dangers to children to our attention,\u201d Arsham said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s fair for us to expect other human services professionals \u2014 whether they be in education, health care, anybody who is a mandated reporter \u2014 to use their independent judgment and discretion and understand there are consequences to making that call.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s very hard because the whole system isn\u2019t adequate in addressing families\u2019 needs. It would be much easier to call ACS if you could count on them as a holistic agency to families that are marginalized. Leila Ortiz, social worker in New York City public schools\n\nPart of the challenge facing school officials, according to Leila Ortiz, a social worker in New York City public schools, is that ACS is primarily oriented to investigate families, not provide support. Chronic absenteeism could indeed be the canary in the coal mine, she said, signaling deeper troubles within a family. \u201cIf you don\u2019t call that in, something could potentially be happening to the student,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know, they\u2019re not in the building.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut at the same time,\u201d Ortiz added, \u201cyou could be adding more stress and damage to a family that already has a lot on their plate. It\u2019s very hard because the whole system isn\u2019t adequate in addressing families\u2019 needs. It would be much easier to call ACS if you could count on them as a holistic agency to families that are marginalized.\u201d\n\nAntagonistic Approach\n\nDespite ACS\u2019s efforts to be more sensitive to families facing investigations, parents don\u2019t tend to experience child welfare investigations as even remotely helpful. A New York City parent named Gabriela \u2014 who is going by her middle name for this article because her case is still ongoing and she fears retaliation \u2014 knows the type of havoc that a call to ACS can wreak on a family. Over the course of her decades-long career as an advocate for immigrants in East Harlem, she has developed an acute understanding of ways in which families can get unfairly wrapped up in an opaque process. Some of these cases have made sense to her. Many more have seemed unfounded, with cultural differences in child-rearing clearly playing a role.\n\nBut she never expected to have to use this ACS expertise with her own family.\n\nLast January, when Gabriela received a knock on the door of her Bronx home from an ACS caseworker, she was shocked to learn that she was the subject of a child abuse investigation. Even more surprising was the source of the complaint: her 10-year-old child\u2019s school.\n\nDays prior, Gabriela\u2019s daughter had gone to her teacher with a secret: That her daddy \u2014 amid grief from the death of his mother \u2014 had started regularly drinking. Gabriela said that she had tried to keep this behavior from her daughter, and thought she hadn\u2019t noticed the new wrinkles in family life.\n\nWhat happened next was a whirlwind. The child, hysterically crying and scared, was pulled into a room with several adults and questioned about her home life. Under pressure \u2014 and wanting to provide the right answer \u2014 she said that her mom, Gabriela, had hit her, a charge that Gabriela denies.\n\nGabriela recognizes that the school was trying to help \u2014 and in some ways was carrying out a professional duty \u2014 but says they brought a \u201cnightmare to my house.\u201d\n\nA Mexican immigrant who came to America as a teenager, Gabriela has been deeply involved in the education of her daughter at every step. Over the years, Gabriela has taken the time to get to know her daughter\u2019s teachers and school principal, while advocating for the school\u2019s immigrant families who need extra services. How could the school\u2019s leaders, whom Gabriela knew so well, see her as anything less than a devoted parent?\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they use the social worker outside? Why didn\u2019t they call me with concerns? Why did they go straight for the kill and call ACS?\u201d questioned Gabriela.\n\nShe wonders if, in the delicate balancing act of being an involved parent but trying not to overstep her role, she landed on the wrong side of the equation. Or if, in her role as an advocate for immigrant families, she pushed too hard.\n\nShe also wonders if this process would have played out differently if she had a different ACS caseworker. (Charges against her were sustained and she is currently amid the appeals process.) This caseworker has asked her on three separate occasions about her immigration status, apparently unable to believe that Gabriela is an American citizen, Gabriela recounts.\n\n\u201cWhen you go through this, it\u2019s not just a nightmare for you, it\u2019s a nightmare for your child, because the stress level it creates for our family is horrible,\u201d said Gabriela, through tears, one Tuesday afternoon in August.\n\nA representative for the school said that all employees receive training on child abuse and follow state law regarding reporting.\n\nCaroline Preston/The Hechinger Report After an employee at her child\u2019s school reported Sandra for alleged abuse, she went from being very involved in her sons\u2019 education to being fearful of teachers and administrators.\n\nEven for parents who have their records cleared, the pernicious consequences of investigations can be permanent. In 2015, Sandra, a mother of three in Chicago, was investigated by DCFS after her youngest son went to school with what she describes as a minor scratch he sustained from roughhousing with his brothers.\n\nAfter a DCFS worker arrived on her doorstep, her entire life was thrown under suspicion. The flowers that were a Valentine\u2019s Day gift from her husband, for example? The investigator asked if they were evidence of her husband trying to repair damage from a marital fight.\n\nUltimately the abuse allegation against Sandra was overturned. But three years and $15,000 in legal fees later, she said she\u2019s still reluctant to meet with or talk to school employees. Recently, the assistant principal at her youngest son\u2019s school called Sandra and her husband in for a meeting to discuss the boy\u2019s behavior, as he\u2019d been getting frustrated in class and acting out. When the administrator suggested she take a stronger disciplinary approach, Sandra pushed back hard: \u201cI am not going to yell at him or touch him because you guys already put me through this one time.\u201d\n\nGrowing Awareness\n\nAccording to NYU\u2019s Gottlieb, there needs to be a greater understanding of the damage caused by needless investigations and the higher rates at which parents of color are caught up in them. \u201cYou want to help parents make better choices for their kids,\u201d she said, \u201cand starting out by saying, \u2018You\u2019re abusive,\u2019 is not the way to do it.\u201d\n\nOne step forward, say critics of child welfare, could be to modify mandated reporter training \u2014 by using it in part to educate people about implicit racial bias, for example. The training that has long been offered to Illinois\u2019 school employees is a one-time online course that takes 60 to 90 minutes to complete and includes no mention of race. Chicago Public Schools says that starting this year, it has begun offering an in-person, annual training.\n\nMeanwhile, experiments to reduce racial and socioeconomic inequities in the child welfare system have shown some success. New York\u2019s Nassau County was able to significantly reduce the numbers of black kids put in foster care after placing an emphasis on workforce diversity among human services employees and withholding children\u2019s demographic information from staff meetings. A second New York county, Onandaga, began removing fewer black kids from their parents after investing in afterschool and other school-based programs.\n\nIn New York City, ACS is rolling out a new approach to responding to low-risk calls that focuses on assessing which services fragile families need, said ACS\u2019s Arsham.\n\nNeil Skene, a spokesperson for the Illinois DCFS, wrote in an email that while a child welfare investigation is a \u201cpainful experience for anyone,\u201d the agency feels it has a \u201cparticular obligation to be responsive to the concerns and professional knowledge of mandated reporters.\u201d Skene added: \u201cWe are starting to work with local communities to identify cultural and racial disparities and how we can respond better.\u201d\n\nOut Of Options\n\nChange can\u2019t happen soon enough for families embroiled in school-driven investigations. For them, transferring schools can feel like the only way out.\n\nIn 2015, after the harassment Givens says she endured at Success Academy, she sent her son to a different elementary school nearby. \u201cFrom first to fourth grade, no problems, no incidents, no suspensions, no fighting, no nothing,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen you go through this, it\u2019s not just a nightmare for you, it\u2019s a nightmare for your child, because the stress level it creates for our family is horrible. Gabriela, advocate and mother investigated by ACS\n\nGabriela\u2019s daughter has also switched schools, after feeling uncomfortable and mistrustful of the adults who called ACS on her parents. \u201cShe went from asking me, \u2018Please don\u2019t take me to school, can I stay with you?\u2019 \u201d Gabriela said of her daughter, \u201cto getting up in the morning, getting ready, excited to participate.\u201d\n\nBanks considered removing her two boys from their magnet school after the child-protection investigations began. Relatives, colleagues, even her kids\u2019 pediatrician \u2014 they all warned that the hotline calls wouldn\u2019t stop until her children left the school. Because she worked with kids, the investigations were particularly worrisome for her, she said, even though ultimately none of the cases against her had been substantiated.\n\nBut at the same time, she was reluctant. The magnet school offered four foreign languages, math teams and movie nights, things she worried her kids wouldn\u2019t get at their neighborhood school. \u201cI feel like they are winning,\u201d she said. \u201cI understand his behavior is poor,\u201d she said of her youngest son, \u201cbut he does deserve to be at a school where he can get a good education.\u201d\n\nPlus, by the time she came to grips with the unrelenting nature of the investigations, the December deadline for applying to specialized schools had already passed. She looked into private schools before deciding they were too expensive."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Carla Herreria", "title": "Camp Fire\u2019s Missing Person List Climbs To 1,011, Statewide Death Toll At 74", "description": "A fire official warned that the list may \"fluctuate both up and down\" and said it may contain duplicate names.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/camp-fire-missing-person-list-doubles_us_5bef8a53e4b0b84243e27cd4", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bef9b801d0000e201313321.jpeg?cache=kxlEIWi9rR&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T04:54:50Z", "content": "The number of names on the missing person\u2019s list for Northern California\u2019s Camp fire has grown to 1,011 on Friday night, nearly doubling the number reported yesterday, though fire officials warned that the list may include duplicates.

But they slowly whittled down the number. In the end, 44 people died in several counties.\n\nThe wildfire this time all but razed the town of Paradise, population 27,000, and heavily damaged the outlying communities of Magalia and Concow on Nov. 8, destroying 9,700 houses and 144 apartment buildings, authorities said.\n\nFirefighters were gaining ground against the blaze, which blackened 222 square miles (575 square kilometers). It was 45 percent contained and posed no immediate threat to populated areas.

He became friendly with the Clark brothers, who once helped him build a treehouse for his son.\n\nBut Bilal distanced himself from Jeffrey Clark and his younger brother, Edward, as they became increasingly radical, especially after one blowout fight over then-candidate Donald Trump. Then, on the night of Trump\u2019s election, Bilal\u2019s mother called to tell him about a group gathered on Clark\u2019s porch chanting about Hitler.\n\nLast summer, after someone snatched a gay pride flag off a front porch near the Clarks\u2019 home, a group of about six people ripped another pride flag off the front of the Showtime bar and a bunch of white supremacist flyers were scattered around the neighborhood, neighbors contacted Bilal, who had since moved to Maryland, and told him they suspected the Clark brothers were involved.\n\nSo Bilal went to talk to another Bloomingdale neighbor: a District of Columbia police officer. He told the cop who lived just down the street from the Clarks that neighbors were worried the brothers were involved with the racist propaganda spreading throughout the neighborhood. The police officer said he would look into it.\n\nThat was the last he heard of it.\n\nA year later, one of the brothers is dead and the other is imprisoned on gun charges after family members told the FBI that the elder Clark brother is a dangerous white supremacist. Edward Clark, 23, killed himself on Roosevelt Island in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 27, hours after the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre. In the following days, 30-year-old Jeffrey wrote on Gab, a social media site popular among racists, that Robert Bowers, that the accused Pittsburgh shooter, was a \u201chero\u201d and that the synagogue victims \u201cdeserved\u201d to be killed. Jeffrey was arrested on Nov. 9 after his relatives turned him into the FBI.\n\nOn Friday, a federal magistrate judge ordered Jeffrey held until trial following a hearing in which a federal prosecutor described the defendant as \u201ca bomb\u201d waiting to explode.\n\nU.S. Attorney's Office A noose found inside the Clark home.\n\nThe death by suicide, the arrest and the public revelations about the Clark brothers\u2019 ideology have left their neighbors struggling to understand how the two men were able to spend years going to white supremacist meet-ups, making violent threats online and stockpiling guns in their home without attracting attention from law enforcement in the heart of a progressive city like Washington. Even Jeffrey Clark\u2019s public praise of the violent actions of Bowers and Cesar Sayoc, the Florida Trump supporter accused of sending pipe bombs to prominent Democrats, likely would have gone unnoticed by authorities if his own family hadn\u2019t reported his behavior.\n\nIt also raises questions about law enforcement\u2019s ability to keep tabs on radicalized right-wingers who could pose a threat while they navigate First Amendment protections. Despite the Clark brothers\u2019 extensive online support for hate groups and their reputation in their Bloomingdale neighborhood, a law enforcement official confirmed that they were not on the FBI\u2019s radar until the family members raised concerns.\n\nThe Clark family moved to Washington from Utah, where both parents had attended Brigham Young University. They sent their kids to private Catholic schools. After briefly living in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, the Clarks bought their house in Bloomingdale. When the parents later split up, the father stayed in the Bloomingdale house with his three children: Jeffrey, Edward and a daughter.\n\nU.S. Attorney's Office Body armor and helmets found inside the Clark home.\n\nBilal, whose mother has lived in the neighborhood for decades, noticed a shift in the Clark brothers after Edward was mugged on his way to the store several years ago. The brothers shaved their heads and Jeffrey started carrying a gun.\n\n\u201cI think it really affected their manhood,\u201d Bilal said.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Bilal and Jeffrey got into arguments about Trump. Jeffrey ranted about his hatred for Mexicans, and Edward seemed to go along with it, Bilal said.\n\n\u201cI think [Jeffrey] kind of respected me in a sense where he didn\u2019t want to let me know his true nature,\u201d said Bilal, who is black. \u201cBut deep down inside, I think he hated my guts.\u201d\n\nJeffrey claimed in a podcast last year that he \u201cwas not somebody that would have been described as a racist a few years ago.\u201d He claims he went looking for answers and found it in the so-called alt-right. According to Jeffrey, the rise of the alt-right is due to people\u2019s dissatisfaction with the \u201cZionist-occupied government.\u201d\n\nOver the past year and a half, Jeffrey and Edward became regulars at white nationalist gatherings. They appeared at an April 2017 protest outside the White House organized by alt-right leader Richard Spencer to protest military airstrikes in Syria.\n\nAnd you can't spell \"aspiring mass shooter\" without \"Richard Spencer\" somewhere in there.

Posobiec denied working with the Clarks, despite appearing in several photographs where he is being filmed by the Clark brothers in Bloomingdale. Jeffrey attended a \u201cFreedom of Speech\u201d rally in D.C. in June 2017 with other alt-right members, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Around the same time, Jeffrey and Edward showed up at a D.C. bookstore to disrupt an event with Alexander Reid Ross, an author who was discussing his book Against the Fascist Creep. The Clarks were there with Jamie Troutman, a white nationalist who goes by AltRightVA online. That month, Jeffrey Traveled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to participate in a March Against Sharia rally organized by the Islamophobic group ACT for America, according to the Anti-Defamation League and screenshots of tweets reviewed by HuffPost.\n\nUnite the Right organizer Jason Kessler tweeted at the time, \u201cThese are some of my favorite people! #MAGA,\u201d referring to pictures of the Clark brothers. Kessler wrote in an email that he does not condone politically motivated violence \u2014 but he claims it is the natural result of failing to address the grievances of white people. Suppressing that conversation, he wrote, pushes people \u201cinto an echo chamber of extremism and frustration where thoughts of violence seem like the only way out.\u201d\n\n\n\nThese are some of my favorite people! #MAGA https://t.co/8qdzIq8VkF \u2014 Jason Kessler (@TheMadDimension) June 10, 2017\n\nThe Clark brothers also appeared at Kessler\u2019s initiation into the Proud Boys, a violent neo-fascist gang whose leader claims the group is not racist despite attracting white nationalist members.\n\nIt was around this time that the white supremacist flyers appeared in Bloomingdale and Bilal asked the local police officer to look into the Clark brothers. The D.C. police officer who lived within eyesight of the Clark home did not immediately respond to a voicemail message left with his wife. Metropolitan Police Department spokeswoman Brianna Jordan told HuffPost in an email that she has no knowledge of the tip. She declined to say whether the police department investigated the flyers or the theft and attempted theft of the pride flags.\n\nThe Clark brothers traveled to Charlottesville, Virginia, to attend the deadly white nationalist rally there in August 2017. They appeared in a photo near James Alex Fields Jr., who drove a car into protesters, killing Heather Heyer and injuring several others.\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Spencer's \"anti-war\" rally\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Spencer's first torch rally on 5/13/17\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Kessler's Proud Boy night on 6/17\n\n\u2611\ufe0f UTR planning Discord chats\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Stood near Fields on UTR\n\n\n\nThis is probably the tip of the iceberg but what more do y'all need before realizing this isn't a fucking game? pic.twitter.com/oIOEbb79wq \u2014 Stop the Next 'Unite the Right' (@stopthenextutr) November 14, 2018\n\nThis August, a neighbor snapped photos of a man he says was Patrick Little, a neo-Nazi who ran for Senate in California. Little was known to be in D.C. at the time, where he held a sign saying \u201cExpel the Jews\u201d outside of the White House, and the elder Clark brother had promoted Little on Gab. Little did not respond to questions about his ties to Clark. Instead, he told HuffPost he would grant an interview in exchange for a summary of a film about \u201cJewish Supremacism.\u201d\n\nBy this time, multiple neighbors suspected the Clark brothers, who were quiet and kept to themselves, of being right-wing extremists. One person who lived in the neighborhood had Googled the Clark family and found screenshots of what appeared to be Jeffrey\u2019s suspended Twitter and Facebook profiles, which included images of Jeffrey posing with a swastika, as well as descriptions of the brothers as associates of Richard Spencer. The neighbor was horrified but didn\u2019t know what to do. Despite watching for suspicious activity, the neighbor didn\u2019t find anything online or see anything in person that was illegal.\n\nHad the Clark brothers been vocal advocates of the Islamic State instead of the Third Reich, they likely would have attracted law enforcement\u2019s attention long ago. If Jeffrey was supporting a group like ISIS or al Qaeda, he could now be facing a material support charge based on his public advocacy for a group the U.S. government has labeled as a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nBut there\u2019s no federal law against domestic terrorism, a fact that surprises many Americans. Consequently, federal law enforcement takes a much different approach to investigating armed neo-Nazis advocating violence than it would sympathizers of radical Islamist terrorist groups.\n\nJeffrey Clark was charged with the federal crime of illegally possessing a firearm while using or addicted to a controlled substance \u2014 a rarely used criminal statute \u2014 and the D.C. crime of possessing a high-capacity ammunition magazine. The maximum prison sentence for the federal statute is 10 years and the maximum time for the D.C. offense is one year.\n\nThat means federal authorities are leaning heavily on the notion that Clark owned a gun while addicted to marijuana as the basis of his imprisonment. Marijuana is legal in Washington, although it is still an illegal substance under federal law.\n\nClark appeared in federal court in D.C. on Friday afternoon, where prosecutors argued for his continued detention because they say he poses a threat to the public and is a flight risk.\n\nU.S. Attorney's Office A Nazi flag found inside the Clark home.\n\nBoth David Bos, a federal public defender representing Clark, and Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey indicated during Clark\u2019s detention hearing Friday that they\u2019d never seen prosecutors use the unusual federal charge.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney John Cummings said in court Friday that it was \u201cclear to anyone in that house what was going on\u201d and that Clark\u2019s \u201cglorification of violence and hatred for minority groups\u201d \u2015 together with his possession of weapons and use of marijuana \u2015 made him a \u201cvery dangerous combination.\u201d Cummings noted that Clark told law enforcement he could respond violently if the government took his weapons \u2014 and that Clark would be banned from owning weapons if convicted of the felony count. Asked by the judge if Clark\u2019s father was one of the relatives who turned him in, Cummings said he was not.\n\nBos, representing Clark, argued that Clark\u2019s \u201cdistasteful comments\u201d were \u201cconstitutionally protected\u201d and suggested the government was grasping at straws to find a charge to stick.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had a case in which the government went forward on this portion of the statute,\u201d said Bos, who has been practicing for 30 years.\n\nWhile concurring that Clark was facing an \u201cunusual charge\u201d that the judge hadn\u2019t seen before, Harvey ordered Clark detained until trial, saying he couldn\u2019t ignore Clark\u2019s \u201cthreatening\u201d and \u201cmenacing\u201d posts and his family members\u2019 concern that his anger \u201chas intensified\u201d in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cIt seemed that the defendant was preparing for something,\u201d Harvey said.\n\nBefore the hearing, federal prosecutors indicated in a filing that Clark told law enforcement he wanted to move West Virginia to nonviolently \u201ctake over\u201d a town with \u201clike-minded white nationalists.\u201d They also laid out additional evidence against the elder Clark brother, saying that authorities searching the home found a flyer from the Atomwaffen Division, a violent neo-Nazi group responsible for several murders; a rope tied into a noose above his bed; a Nazi flag and body armor; and a drawing of a gunman aiming at a caricature of a Jewish man wearing a yarmulke.\n\nNext to the anti-Semitic drawing was a bullet-pointed list of an agenda for \u201cpeaceful resolution,\u201d which included legalizing discrimination, cutting off all welfare, ending all immigration, deporting all illegal immigrants, banishing criminals to Mexico, and affirming the First and Second amendments. The final point in the plan: \u201cEnd birthright citizenship.\u201d"}]
