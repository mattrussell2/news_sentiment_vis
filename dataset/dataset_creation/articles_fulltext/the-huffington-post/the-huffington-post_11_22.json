He\u2019s been avoiding them since the mid-\u201960s,\u201d said Will Fischer, an Iraq War veteran with the liberal group VoteVets, referring to Trump\u2019s avoidance of service during the Vietnam War.\n\nTrump sat in a chandeliered room with gold ceilings and read from a script before conversing with several of them on issues ranging from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to whether the United States was getting \u201cripped off\u201d on trade agreements.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see any issues in terms of trade right now,\u201d a Coast Guard commander stationed in Bahrain said, sounding somewhat puzzled.\n\nAs he did on Tuesday while leaving the White House for his Thanksgiving vacation, Trump hinted that he might visit troops in a forward combat zone. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do some interesting things. We\u2019ll be doing some very interesting things,\u201d he told reporters invited by the White House to watch Trump\u2019s teleconference from his members-only Mar-a-Lago club.\n\nHe added that he knew when he would be going but would not say. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you. You\u2019re the last people I can tell,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nWhether Trump ever visits any troops overseas, though, is far from guaranteed. Trump has made numerous promises that he has failed to honor.\n\nHe pledged that he would release his tax returns if he ran for president, for instance, but has refused to do so since he announced his campaign three years ago. He promised hundreds of times during his campaign that he would build a wall along the southwestern border and force Mexico to pay for it, but in his first two years, has not broached the topic a single time with the Mexican president\u2019s office.\n\nFurther, Trump has long been clear about his deep concern for his personal safety. During his 2015 visit to the Conservative Political Action Conference in a suburb of Washington, D.C., he was accompanied by at least a half dozen private bodyguards, back when he was merely a reality television host and golf course developer. Other speakers, including sitting senators and governors, traveled with either no security at all or one or two state police agents.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, upon seeing news of a suicide bombing in Iraq on television, Trump was asked to name the most dangerous place he has ever visited. After joking \u201cBrooklyn,\u201d he replied that the United States had extremely unsafe places of its own.\n\n\u201cThere are places in America that are among the most dangerous in the world. You go to places like Oakland. Or Ferguson. The crime numbers are worse. Seriously,\u201d he told The New York Times.\n\nAnd The Washington Post reported this week that Trump does not want to visit combat zones because he fears for his life.\n\nThe White House on Thursday did not respond to a query about that report. But those fears, if true, appear consistent with Trump\u2019s history. While he has claimed to be pro-military for decades, he avoided service in Vietnam using a string of education deferments and then claimed a medical exemption because of bone spurs in his heels.\n\nHe later described that period as a difficult time because of the danger of contracting sexually transmitted diseases from the women he was sleeping with. \u201cIt is my personal Vietnam,\u201d he told radio host Howard Stern in 1997. \u201cI feel like a great and very brave soldier.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Trump has made a habit of attacking military veterans and families when they have criticized him.\n\nHe insulted former POW and Arizona Sen. John McCain, saying that he preferred those who had not been captured. Trump insulted Gold Star parents whose Muslim son was killed in 2004 in Iraq while saving those under his command. And just this week, Trump falsely stated that retired Adm. Bill McRaven, the decorated Navy SEAL whose team killed Sept. 11 terrorist Osama bin Laden, was a Hillary Clinton supporter. Trump then criticized McRaven for not having gotten bin Laden sooner.\n\nTrump has made but a single visit to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to meet the returning remains of fallen service members, very early in his presidency, and has refused to attend another one after a parent of a killed Special Forces member berated him at the arrival ceremony.\n\nTwo major accomplishments he boasts of \u2014 providing record-high budgets for the military and passing a law to let veterans see local private doctors \u2014 are false.\n\nPresident Barack Obama approved a $721 billion defense budget in 2010 and one for $717 billion in 2011. Both were higher than the $716 billion budget Trump repeatedly brags about for this year \u2014 even before adjusting for inflation. And the Veterans Choice Program that Trump claims he passed was actually also passed under Obama, in 2014.\n\nObama made four visits to Afghanistan during his two terms and flew to Iraq in the first months of his presidency, even though he campaigned against the war there.\n\nIn the days preceding the recent midterm elections, Trump deployed 5,000 active-duty troops to the border with Mexico to string up barbed wire against what he described as an \u201cinvasion\u201d of Central American refugees seeking asylum. He also has not visited those troops, even though they remain separated from their families over the Thanksgiving holidays because of what critics have called a political stunt.\n\nAnd after the elections, he skipped a visit to an American cemetery in France commemorating the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I because of rain and fog. Two days later, back in Washington on the observed Veterans Day holiday, he chose not to visit Arlington National Cemetery and remained at the White House tweeting instead.\n\nWrapping up his session with reporters Thursday morning, Trump said that he was thankful for how successful he has been as president. \u201cI made a tremendous difference in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis country is so much stronger now than it was when I took office, and you wouldn\u2019t believe it, and when you see it, we\u2019ve gotten so much stronger, people don\u2019t even believe it.\u201d\n\nTrump followed his teleconference with overseas service members Thursday morning with a brief visit to the Coast Guard station at nearby Lake Worth Inlet before heading to his private, for-profit golf course in West Palm Beach. He arrived there by noon, then headed back across the Intracoastal Waterway to Palm Beach, where he was scheduled to have Thanksgiving dinner."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Kimberley Richards", "title": "KING JAMES RETURNS: LeBron Gets Warm Welcome In Return To Cleveland", "description": "\"Felt great to be back,\" the NBA superstar wrote on Twitter.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-lakers_us_5bf6c4c1e4b03b230f9f743f", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf702ca260000e103847dfa.jpeg?cache=u9mumlx6l5&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T21:35:24Z", "content": "LeBron James received a warm welcome from the city of Cleveland during his return as a Los Angeles Laker this week.

Liam Cunningham told me he couldn\u2019t even access his scripts on the secure iPads.\n\nWell, sometimes there were paparazzi in amazing places \u2015 on construction cranes and all kinds of crazy places, to try to get a point of view of things. They were all over, everywhere, trying to get in on what was happening. But it was definitely a situation where there was no paper on the set, [that] type of thing. [The production team] wanted to make sure nobody knew what was happening, and they went to the nth degree, like they do on the show in general. They basically take it to the point where it\u2019s like the Gestapo. It\u2019s tough to get answers.\n\nObviously, everyone has theories on how it ends. Knowing how it ends, what would you tell those fans?\n\nAll I know is that David and Dan spent a lot of time to tell the story in a proper fashion, and the audience will be completely satisfied. Not everybody will be satisfied, but I feel the audience will be satisfied with the direction the series goes. It lives up to all the building it\u2019s coming to, I promise you that.\n\nDirecting the opening for Season 8, how did you prepare? Were you watching old episodes?\n\nThere\u2019s definitely some of that. To me, it was all about living up to Jeremy Podeswa (a GOT director). He\u2019s done some amazing season openers, most notably Season 7. He\u2019s a tremendous friend and a great director... I was hoping I can live up to his great work.\n\nYou\u2019ve been part of the show since Season 2. What\u2019s it like seeing where it is now?\n\nIt\u2019s interesting getting a chance to work with all the actors. Sophie, when she first met the Hound and was in Westeros, has now grown into a formidable queen in her own right and respect. Arya, who\u2019s gone from this little kid who wanted to be noticed and seen to very formidable in her own right. The growth of those family members has really been a lot of fun, and getting a chance to work with new exciting actors and fun people as well has been a real pleasure. Things like the Daznak Pit, and of course the Walk of Shame and the Red Wedding, were highlights to my career. It\u2019s something I\u2019ll never forget.\n\nYou did an Ask Me Anything interview on the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Reddit for your new film \u201cRising.\u201d What was that experience like?\n\nIt was a lot of fun. It was interesting. I have never done that before. It\u2019s pretty much direct questions and so forth. I used to work on \u201cThe X-Files\u201d in the first couple seasons\u2026 we would actually do chatrooms with fans.\n\nHow\u2019d you end up directing it?\n\nThey had another director in mind to do the project but something fell through and he couldn\u2019t do it, so I\u2019d worked with the production company before and they contacted me. I said, \u201cMy God, I\u2019d love to do it.\u201d Nothing would excite me more than doing something of value, and something that hopefully has a message people could actually relate to.\n\nWhat is that message?\n\nFor someone who watches it \u2015 no matter who they are, no matter what their affiliation or feelings about anything at all \u2015 the hope would be someone who watches it gets perspective about their next-door neighbor, about the people across the street, about themselves, because prejudice is performed through blindness. I think this is a situation where I really wanted people to watch it and have their own personal reaction to it, because to me \u2014 because of the length of the project... something that is a little bit longer than a commercial \u2015 we wanted to give the audience a chance to become emotionally invested.\n\nWhy does it take disasters to bring people together?\n\nWe seem to live in a society that\u2019s all about confrontation and fear and misunderstanding... we don\u2019t listen enough. We think that the key to life is to keep growing and listening and learning.\n\nYou have a character in here, a mechanic, who seems like a stereotypical Donald Trump supporter. Where did that character come from? What was the thinking behind him?\n\nIt\u2019s interesting, that character could be formed as anything you want it to be. This is a man who\u2019s working on his car, listening to music. This kid comes out. He turns around, watches the kid, turns his music off\u2026 it really depends on who you are and where you come from, for your specific take on it. What\u2019s fascinating [is that] everyone who watches it will have their own take, so there was never an occasion or a situation where I wanted to stereotype anyone at all. We are not stereotypes of people... I wanted to make it as real as possible.\n\nIf the president ended up seeing this film, what would you want him to take from it?\n\nFor him to pause, and that\u2019s about all you\u2019d ever get, and also for him to watch it by himself in a room so he can actually not have to respond in front of everybody, because it\u2019s a very personal story. I think it\u2019s a situation where we all are the same. We all are equal, we all need to respect each other and I think we need each other to survive. I think it\u2019s a situation where if that could happen, if he could pause for one moment and have one less tweet... then we\u2019ve done something positive."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Carly Ledbetter", "title": "Pete Davidson's New Ruth Bader Ginsberg Tattoo Is Never Getting Covered Up", "description": "The \"Saturday Night Live\" comedian\u2019s shoulder now features a portrait of the Supreme Court justice.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pete-davidson-ruth-bader-ginsberg-tattoo_us_5bf6ca03e4b03b230f9f81fb", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf6e66c3c00008f040ebc3d.jpeg?cache=pcPgIgjAdi&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T18:46:06Z", "content": "Pete Davidson seems to be on a never-ending mission to cover up old tattoos and get new ones for his collection.

Miraculously, Tisquantum escaped and returned to the \u201cNew World\u201d and to the coastal village where he once lived. In the years he was gone, his entire family died of disease.\n\nA short time later, struggling, desperate English settlers arrived on the shores where his tribe, the Wampanoag, still lived. Tisquantum was key to their survival. Because of his time in Europe, he could speak English. He helped the settlers plant corn and survive winter, and he brokered a peace agreement, without which their colony \u2015 and, by extension, the United States \u2015 would have never existed. The first treaty and the first land grant to the white settlers in North America were translated by this man.\n\nFew people who celebrate Thanksgiving know Squanto\u2019s full name or the name of his tribe. But without Tisquantum or the Wampanoag, the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock surely would have died.\n\nAnd on this Thanksgiving, the United States government is in the process of terminating the reservation of the tribe that welcomed the Pilgrims.\n\nOn Sept. 7, Cedric Cromwell, the chairman of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe received a letter from Tara Sweeney, the assistant secretary of Indian affairs at the Department of the Interior, informing him that his tribe no longer fit the legal definition of \u201cIndian\u201d and would be losing its reservation status. This is the first time that land held under special status for tribes has been taken out of trust since Harry Truman\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cThe same country that we helped form is now turned against us,\u201d Cromwell told HuffPost this week. \u201cIt\u2019s quite frightening that our own country is attacking us during the holiday that we helped establish.\u201d\n\nThe legal battle over the Mashpee reservation started in 2016, when casino developer Neil Bluhm wanted to open a casino in a part of Massachusetts set aside for tribal gaming only. He financially backed a small group of residents from the city of Taunton, where the tribe planned to open a casino, to sue the Department of Interior, demanding the agency revoke the reservation\u2019s trust status. In July 2016, the Taunton residents won.\n\nBut the wording of the court\u2019s ruling kicked the decision back to the DOI, which could have legally affirmed the Mashpee\u2019s trust status and saved its reservation. In September the administration declined to do that.\n\n\u201cBecause the Tribe was not \u2018under federal jurisdiction\u2019 in 1934, the Tribe does not qualify under the [Indian Reorganization Act\u2019s] first definition of \u2018Indian,\u2019\u201d Sweeney wrote in her letter.\n\nThe sprawling 1934 Indian Reorganization Act gave the DOI the ability to take land into trust for tribes. Before 1934, tribes lost 90 million acres to allotment. Since then, tribes have been buying back stolen land within their treaty territories. But tribal ownership of a piece of land does not make it Indian Country. For the tribe to be able to exercise jurisdiction, practice self-governance or operate a casino there, the DOI has to put that land into trust.\n\nFor decades, the DOI put land into trust without hesitation and restored 9 million acres of lost tribal land. With the advent of Indian gaming in the 1990s, this long-established practice suddenly became controversial. Powerful gaming interests started fighting new trust lands to shut out tribes and corner the casino market.\n\nIn 1993, Trump, then a New York real estate mogul deeply invested in Atlantic City casinos, testified before Congress that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was unfair and hurting his business. \u201cThey don\u2019t look like Indians to me,\u201d he said.\n\nThe same country that we helped form is now turned against us. Cedric Cromwell, chairman, Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe\n\nNow he and his administration are still arguing that contemporary tribes are not Indian enough for treaty rights and federal statutes to apply. Under the Obama administration, over 500,000 acres of land were taken into trust. Under Trump, the slow restoration of tribal lands has come to a dead stop. According to the DOI\u2019s legal arguments, if the Mashpee Wampanoag are not Indian enough to have trust land, 128 of the 573 federally recognized tribes in the United States could lose their reservations as well.\n\nWith the Mashpee decision, the country is moving backward.\n\nAfter exhausting his options with the judicial and executive branches, Cromwell is taking his fight to the legislative branch. \u201cCongress has the ultimate plenary authority to protect tribes,\u201d he said. \u201cBased on how we protected the early settlers and helped create this country.\u201d\n\nThe two lawmakers who represent the tribe, Reps. Bill Keating and Joe Kennedy III (both D-Mass.), have co-authored legislation to cement federal recognition of the Mashpee Wampanoag land. The text of the Mashpee Tribe Reservation Reaffirmation Act is shorter than this article and straightforwardly states that all laws with \u201cgeneral applicability to Indians\u201d apply to the Mashpee.

It said its own internal investigation, prompted by a whistleblower, found serious misconduct including under-reporting of his income and misuse of company assets.\n\nIt was a stunning downfall for one of the biggest figures in the auto industry, a man who helped drive turnarounds at both France\u2019s Renault SA and at Nissan and then managed an alliance between them that sold 10.6 million cars last year, besting its rivals.\n\nNissan said in a statement filed to the Tokyo Stock Exchange that its investigation uncovered misuse of company investment funds and expense money for personal gain.\n\nEarlier this week, Renault voted to keep Ghosn as its chief executive but appointed Thierry Bollore, its chief operating officer, as its interim chief.\n\nAnother Nissan executive, Greg Kelly, was arrested in Japan on suspicion of collaborating in the wrongdoing and also will be dismissed as a representative director, Nissan said. Their replacements will be decided later, it said.\n\nGhosn, 64, is suspected of under-reporting $44.6 million in income from 2011 to 2015, according to Tokyo prosecutors.\n\nNissan\u2019s board consists of nine members, including Ghosn and Greg Kelly. The seven other board members voted at the meeting, including two members from Nissan and two from Renault.\n\nGhosn and Kelly will remain on Nissan\u2019s board for now as that decision will be up to shareholders. No date has been set yet for a shareholders meeting.\n\nGhosn is also chairman at Mitsubishi Motors Corp., a smaller Japanese automaker that\u2019s partnering with the Renault-Nissan alliance and plans to hold a board meeting next week.\n\nGhosn has been held since his arrest Monday at a Tokyo detention center, under the same Spartan conditions as other detainees, Tokyo deputy prosecutor Shin Kukimoto told reporters Thursday. He gave few details about the case.\n\nUnder Japanese law, suspects can be held for 20 days per possible charge without an official indictment. Additional charges can be tagged on, resulting in longer detentions. Neither has been charged so far.\n\nThe maximum penalty upon conviction for violating finance and exchange laws is 10 years in prison, a 10 million yen ($89,000) fine, or both.\n\nA French citizen born in Brazil, Ghosn became something of a corporate superstar in Japan as he led Nissan\u2019s revival from near bankruptcy after Renault sent him to help in 1999.\n\nGhosn served as Nissan\u2019s chief executive from 2001 until last year. He became chief executive of Renault in 2005, leading the two automakers simultaneously. In 2016, he also became chairman of Mitsubishi Motors Corp. after Nissan took it into the alliance.\n\nKelly, 62, joined Nissan, maker of the Leaf electric car and Infiniti luxury models, in the U.S. in 1988. He became a board member in 2012. His background is in human resources and alliance management.\n\nAnalysts say the future of Nissan\u2019s alliance with Renault may be at stake, though Nissan\u2019s statement Thursday said the company\u2019s leadership was determined to minimize the impact from Ghosn\u2019s case on the partnership. Renault owns 43 percent of Nissan, and Nissan owns 15 percent of Renault.\n\n\u201cThe longstanding alliance partnership with Renault remains unchanged,\u201d the Nissan statement in English said, stressing the alliance rather than the misdeeds.\n\nIt also said the board will study setting up a third-party committee to beef up governance in management and compensation at Nissan.\n\nCEO Hiroto Saikawa, in a lengthy news conference on Monday, said too much power had been concentrated in Ghosn, with too little credit given to the many others working for the company\u2019s success.\n\nJanet Lewis, managing director and head of industrial research, Asia, at Macquarie Capital Securities in Tokyo, said in an interview that an adjustment was needed to give Nissan more say in the alliance with Renault.\n\nThe partnership remains crucial for both companies, she said, since apart from financial ties the companies share technology and parts.\n\nThe automakers need to be more like roommates than a married couple, \u201cSo they have to find a way to share their house and share all of their expertise because it\u2019s very necessary in terms of new automotive technology, new platform development,\u201d Lewis said."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Lee Moran", "title": "The Thanksgiving Turkey Optical Illusion That's Messing With People's Heads", "description": "Wait for it!", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thanksgiving-turkey-video-optical-illusion_us_5bf6a680e4b0771fb6b66a7a", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf6aafc2100009b06ca2905.png?cache=axrbUhQqP4&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T14:31:47Z", "content": "An old Thanksgiving turkey recipe video on YouTube went viral Thursday after it was found to contain a strange optical illusion.

Attorney John Dowd then fired off a searing letter disputing Mueller\u2019s authority to question the president. The interview was off.\n\nNearly a year later, Trump has still not spoken directly to Mueller\u2019s team \u2014 and may never. Through private letters, tense meetings and considerable public posturing, the president\u2019s lawyers have engaged in a tangled, tortured back-and-forth with the special counsel to prevent the president from sitting down for a face-to-face with enormous political and legal consequences.\n\nThe prolonged negotiation speaks to the high stakes for Trump, Mueller\u2019s investigation of his campaign and the presidency. Any questioning of a president in a criminal investigation tests the limit of executive authority. Putting this president on the record also tests his ability to stick to the facts and risks a constitutional showdown.\n\nThe process took a significant step forward this week when Trump\u2019s lawyers handed over the president\u2019s written answers to some of Mueller\u2019s questions. The arrangement was a hard-fought compromise. Trump answered only questions about Russian interference in the 2016 election and not questions about whether he has tried to obstruct the broader investigation into potential coordination between Russia and his presidential campaign. It\u2019s unclear whether Mueller intends to push for more \u2014 either in writing or in person.\n\nSpecial counsel spokesman Peter Carr declined comment.\n\nEven those written answers were months in the making.\n\nIn the months following Mueller\u2019s May 2017 appointment, the White House pledged its cooperation, believing it the fastest way to end the investigation. The administration produced thousands of documents sought by the special counsel and made close Trump aides \u2014 including his legal counsel, chief of staff and press secretary \u2014 available for questioning. White House lawyer Ty Cobb predicted the investigation could conclude by the end of that year.\n\nBut it soon became clear that Mueller would want to interview Trump, given his involvement in several events under scrutiny. The president had fired FBI Director James Comey, harangued his attorney general over his recusal from the Russia investigation and dictated a misleading statement about a Trump Tower meeting involving his son and a Kremlin-connected lawyer.\n\nBut Trump lawyers Dowd and Jay Sekulow moved cautiously.\n\nThe last time a president is known to have been interviewed in a criminal investigation was nearly 15 years ago, and a commander-in-chief has not been subpoenaed before a grand jury since 1998, when President Bill Clinton was summoned in the Whitewater case. Trump\u2019s lawyers were mindful such an interview would be a minefield for a president who often misstates the facts. They set out to avoid it however possible, even if it could lead to resisting a subpoena and bringing on a court fight over presidential power.\n\nBut first they tried to head off a request. Trump\u2019s lawyers staked out a bold constitutional argument, declaring they considered his actions as president outside a prosecutor\u2019s bounds. Mueller had no right to question the president on any of his decisions made at the White House, they argued, saying any outside scrutiny of those choices would curb a president\u2019s executive powers.\n\nAt the same time, they worked to undermine Mueller\u2019s case should he choose to challenge that argument. They furnished a trove of White House documents about key moments in the investigation in hopes of undercutting any claim that he could only get the information he needed by questioning Trump, according to people familiar with the strategy.\n\nTrump had other plans.\n\nAs his lawyers plotted to dig in against any interview, he pushed for one, believing it would exonerate him. In January, he burst into a reporters\u2019 briefing with chief of staff John Kelly and insisted he was eager to speak to Mueller. He might do so in weeks, he said, \u201csubject to my lawyers and all of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would love to do that \u2014 I\u2019d like to do it as soon as possible,\u201d Trump said.\n\nWhat he didn\u2019t mention was that his attorneys had already discussed, and scuttled, the planned interview with Mueller. That process had even progressed to discussing logistics with Kelly, who advised of ways White House officials could get people in and out of the building without the press knowing.\n\nBut the interest cooled after Mueller team prosecutor James Quarles dictated over the phone 16 topics Mueller wanted to cover, including Trump\u2019s interactions with Comey, his knowledge of national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s interview with the FBI and his involvement in the Trump Tower statement. Dowd responded that the answers could all be found in documents and witness statements provided to Mueller. He then canceled the interview and days later drafted a feisty letter contesting the interview\u2019s appropriateness and offering extensive explanations on the incidents in question.\n\nThe investigation has been \u201ca considerable burden for the president and his office, has endangered the safety and security of our country, and has interfered with the president\u2019s ability to both govern domestically and conduct foreign affairs,\u201d Dowd wrote.\n\nIn the following months, Trump told some of his closest confidants that he still wanted to interview with Mueller, according to four White House officials and Republicans close to the White House who asked for anonymity because they were not permitted to publicly discuss private conversations. The president repeatedly insisted he had done nothing wrong and believed he could convince Mueller of that.\n\nHe told one confidant last spring he was frustrated his lawyers didn\u2019t believe he should do it and snapped that he didn\u2019t understand what was taking so long, according to one Republican in contact with the White House.\n\nTensions were on display at a March meeting where Dowd and Sekulow met with Mueller to discuss the need for an interview. Mueller said he needed to know if Trump had a \u201ccorrupt intent\u201d when he fired Comey, such as by intending to stymie the investigation, according to a person familiar with the encounter. Dowd responded that the question was ridiculous and the answer was obviously no. Investigators at the same meeting raised the prospect of a subpoena if Trump didn\u2019t cooperate, Dowd has said.\n\nLater that month, Mueller\u2019s team produced its most detailed list of questions yet \u2014 dozens, in different categories from Trump\u2019s time as a candidate, through the transition period and into his presidency.\n\nTrump\u2019s own views soon began to shift. He had his first misgivings in mid-April after FBI raids on his personal lawyer Michael Cohen, thinking they were a sign that he could \u201cnot trust\u201d Mueller, according to one of the Republicans close to Trump who spoke with the AP.\n\nAs Rudy Giuliani joined Trump\u2019s legal team in April, the White House settled into a new strategy: Drag out the interview drama for months, and use that time to ratchet up attacks on Mueller\u2019s credibility and complaints about the cost and time of the probe, according to the officials and advisers familiar with the strategy.\n\nGiuliani led the charge. His scattershot arguments sometimes frustrated others in the White House, as he frequently moved the goalposts as to what would be required to have an interview. But the effect was to ensure the process would drag out longer.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, continued complaining about the investigation even as his lawyers quietly negotiated acceptable interview terms.\n\nA key breakthrough occurred earlier this fall when Mueller\u2019s team said it would accept written answers on Russian election interference and collusion. The concession ensured that Mueller would get at least some on-the-record response from Trump. Prosecutors tabled questions about obstruction, reserving the right to return to that area later.\n\nGiuliani seemed to foreclose future dialogue Tuesday, saying, \u201cIt is time to bring this inquiry to a conclusion.\u201d\n\nWhether Mueller agrees is a different story."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Corinne Oestreich", "title": "As A Native American, Here's What I Want My Fellow Americans To Know About Thanksgiving - HuffPost", "description": "HuffPost As A Native American, Here's What I Want My Fellow Americans To Know About Thanksgiving HuffPost Native Americans don't just live on reservations, we live in cities, and we live internationally.

I grew up in the Silicon Valley of California. I was born in the city and have lived here my whole life, as an \u201cUrban Native.\u201d My grandfather moved to California from Mohawk territory in the 1950s after he served in Korea, and we have all lived in Sunnyvale ever since.\n\nThe challenges I grew up around were different from my Oyat\u00e9 (family) out on the reservations. It is easier to lose our sense of culture living among so many established settler communities. If I didn\u2019t find my community, my Native family or my traditional support, I\u2019d get swallowed up by colonialism.\n\nAs a child, Thanksgiving was for me what it is for most children \u2015 a day when you spend time with family, talking or thinking about what you\u2019re thankful for. You color some turkey pages and then you eat a lot of food. My family worked really hard to keep the narrative of the dinner between Indians and Pilgrims out of it. The only time I was exposed to this story of a dinner between Pilgrims and Indians was when I was in elementary school. Growing up in an established settler community like the Bay Area, I was not given much perspective on the holiday. I was told: \u201cThis dinner happened. Here, wear this paper feather headdress and let\u2019s eat some cookies bought at Safeway.\u201d\n\nIf I didn\u2019t find my community, my Native family or my traditional support, I\u2019d get swallowed up by colonialism.\n\nAs my younger brother and I grew into adults, we both dove headfirst into learning as much as we could from our elders about our cultures. That desire really intensified after I gave birth to my first child. The need to pass down traditional knowledge grew from that awakening into motherly responsibility. We wanted to honor our ancestors with respectful knowledge and practice. I am Lakota and Mohawk, two very different cultures, so there was much to learn and many opinions that came with it.\n\nI became heavily involved with the Bay Area Native community and attended powwows and ceremonies in San Francisco and San Jose. I talked with as many elders as I could find. I researched my own history as well as my tribal nation\u2019s history and its governments. A side effect to gaining more of that traditional knowledge was fighting the anger that came creeping in along with it.\n\nI found myself dwelling on the pain of what I learned. I became angry and bitter during the holiday and ashamed to celebrate with my family when Thanksgiving rolled around. I especially struggled with this anger around the Thanksgiving holiday when I worked as a resource aide in an elementary school.\n\nI remember the first time I saw a small kindergarten boy walk out of his classroom at the end of the day wearing a feather headdress made from construction paper. It was November, and I had been working at the elementary school for only two months when I saw him come skipping down the hallway with his backpack, purple and green cut feathers flapping back and forth across his blond head.\n\nI froze. It had been years since I was in elementary school myself, and I had completely forgotten about this approach to celebrating Thanksgiving in our schools. I felt sick; I distinctly remember looking at the faces of the parents around me thinking, \u201cIs no one else upset by this?\u201d\n\nThis happened to be the same time as the protests at Standing Rock, and all of the violence my friends went through was a stark contrast to this skipping boy. Here I was sneaking out on my breaks to watch my friends at Standing Rock get sprayed by ice cold water, beaten by police officers, thrown in dog kennels and bitten by security dogs, all while praying and wanting clean water, while another generation of children was being shown that dressing up as an \u201cIndian\u201d was fine on Thanksgiving. I realized the holiday was lifted on some imaginary pedestal as a joyous day of peace between two worlds, when historians know the truth to be much more violent.\n\nI realized the holiday was lifted on some imaginary pedestal as a joyous day of peace between two worlds, when historians know the truth to be much more violent.\n\nAt a Veterans Powwow in 2016, I expressed this anger and pain to an elder. This elder was a veteran and was attending the powwow specifically to participate in the \u201cWiping of Tears\u201d ceremony. This is a healing ceremony that veterans participate in when healing from trauma or post-traumatic stress disorder. It\u2019s part of their recovery from war and from service, and it addresses the release of a lot of anger. This elder took my hand while I waited with them for the ceremony and offered an opinion to me that challenged the anger I had developed for the Thanksgiving holiday. The elder said, \u201cYou can choose how you feel about this day, but it is a choice. Either let the day claim you, or choose to reclaim it.\u201d\n\nI can remember being taken aback by that statement. Can I choose to reclaim this holiday? Doesn\u2019t that dishonor my relatives who have died because of those who came here as Pilgrims? Or maybe I dishonor them by holding on to anger.\n\nSo what could I do, or bring to my family, that would reclaim the day in a way that was both healing and power-giving? My family decided that we would spend the day celebrating the survival of our culture, our language, our foods. This was a decision I made for myself personally. I know that many in my nations are not at a place where they can approach Thanksgiving in this way, but for myself, and for my children, this works. There are also ceremonies \u2015 like the Sunrise Ceremony on Alcatraz Island \u2015 within the Bay Area Native community that help embrace healing on Thanksgiving.\n\nSo what could I do, or bring to my family, that would reclaim the day in a way that was both healing and power-giving?\n\nThe first time I attended the Alcatraz Sunrise Ceremony in San Francisco was in 2017. The Sunrise Ceremony is a special event organized by the Muwekma Ohlone people of San Francisco and other Bay Area Natives, to come together as a community in the darkness of Thanksgiving morning and partake in the reclamation of the holiday for our surviving people. There is always a large, warm bonfire in the center and a circle of relatives and guests that surround it.\n\nThe ceremony has many powerful speakers all focused on the positive reclamation and healing of the day. By the time the sun begins to rise, we raise our palms to the coming light and welcome the power of that healing. Last year at the ceremony, I happened to be standing beside former NFL player Colin Kaepernick, only realizing it after the sunlight began to illuminate those around me. He was there to observe and learn. Through natural conversation, I was gifted the opportunity to be able to share with Mr. Kaepernick some of the teachings of my cultures.\n\nThere was a moment after the ceremony when the two of us were walking through some of the restricted area on Alcatraz to see a mural painted by Alcatraz occupiers in the 1970s. He asked me what my opinion was on Thanksgiving, and the holiday in general. The only answer I could give him on that walk echoed the words of the elder that challenged my own feelings the year before: \u201cI can choose how I feel about this day, but it is a choice. I can either let the holiday claim me, or choose to reclaim it.\u201d\n\nIf I could ask one thing from my non-indigenous fellow Americans when it comes to Thanksgiving, I would ask that you refrain from teaching the romanticized version of the holiday. Read to your children about what it means to be thankful, what it means to heal and be a family. Learn as a family about the tribal nation that is local to where you live. Take time during dinner to recognize whose traditional lands you give thanks on. Take this holiday into your own hands and understand that not every Native will have good feelings about this day, and be accepting of that. We can all choose how we feel about this holiday, but it is always our own choice."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Dominique Mosbergen", "title": "Texas Students Will Soon Learn That Slavery Played \u2018Central Role\u2019 In Sparking Civil War", "description": "The Texas Board of Education has approved revisions to social studies curriculums, but some educators say the changes don't go far enough.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-civil-war-slavery-education-curriculum_us_5bf6772be4b03b230f9ec629", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf695913c00008f040ebc1b.jpeg?cache=deMJpda326&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T12:29:58Z", "content": "After a bitterly contested and, many say, politically driven debate that played out in the public eye, the Texas State Board of Education approved new standards last week for social studies curriculums in public schools.

Under the new standards, the \u201cexpansion of slavery\u201d is highlighted as having played \u201cthe central role\u201d in sparking the conflict \u2014 though sectionalism and states\u2019 rights are still listed as \u201cother contributing factors.\u201d\n\nLawrence Allen Jr., the board\u2019s only African-American member, proposed the language change, NPR reported. He said that Texans remain divided on the history of the Civil War but that the new language makes a clearer link between slavery and the conflict.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an excellent start,\u201d Allen, a Democrat, told Texas Public Radio. \u201cI don\u2019t think we really have that as a consensus in our state ... and so if we can\u2019t drive it to a consensus in our state, we\u2019ll just let our students look at it from all points of view.\u201d\n\nMany educators have criticized the revision as not going far enough, however. Nearly 200 scholars from colleges and universities across Texas took issue with listing states\u2019 rights as a cause of the Civil War.\n\nIn a Nov. 12 letter to the state\u2019s education board, the scholars said doing so \u201cresurrect[s] the \u2018Lost Cause\u2019 myth, a long-discredited version of history first promoted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to glorify the Confederate past and reinforce white supremacist policies such as the disenfranchisement of African Americans and Jim Crow segregation.\u201d\n\nRon Francis, a Dallas middle school teacher who testified before the education board this month, put it another way. \u201cThe lies they\u2019re telling are a little smaller than the lies they used to tell,\u201d he told The Texas Tribune.\n\nHistorians have also taken issue with the board\u2019s decision to keep the biblical figure Moses on a list of political thinkers \u201cwhose principles of laws and government institutions informed the American founding documents.\u201d The board rejected amendments \u201cto remove a reference to the \u2018heroism\u2019 of the defenders of the Alamo\u201d and \u201cto correct a standard that suggests separation of church and state is not a key constitutional principle,\u201d The Washington Post reported.\n\nThe board bowed to public pressure to keep former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and author and activist Helen Keller in the curriculums. A draft of the revisions had removed the two women, along with several other notable figures, in an effort to streamline the curriculums. But the omissions were met with public furor after the proposed changes were made available for public comment in September.\n\nMarty Rowley, a Republican member of the board, said he decided to vote in favor of restoring Clinton\u2019s and Keller\u2019s names to the curriculums after seeing the reaction their proposed removal triggered.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree with Hillary Clinton\u2019s politics, but there was significant public outpouring that indicated that she was a significant political figure that needed to be included, so that\u2019s how I voted,\u201d he told the Times, adding that he took into consideration suggestions made by people living in other states because \u201cTexas has a level of influence, certainly, with regard to instructional materials.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Lee Moran", "title": "Daniel Radcliffe Reveals Why He Won\u2019t Watch The \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 Play", "description": "The British actor won't even go in disguise.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daniel-radcliffe-harry-potter-play_us_5bf69010e4b03b230f9efcfd", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf69df9200000ac060295ac.png?cache=jpo1rgloap&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T12:24:31Z", "content": "You wont see Daniel Radcliffe sitting in the audience for the Harry Potter and the Cursed Child play anytime in the near future even in disguise.

As of December 2017, there were 1.9 million active sellers on Etsy dealing with 33.4 million active buyers. The company reported $1 billion in gross merchandise sales in the fourth quarter of last year.\n\nThe thought of turning an Etsy shop into a full-time business might seem like a dream \u2015 you get to work from wherever you like, selling goods you made or collected, and you have millions of potential customers right at your fingertips.\n\nPlenty of shop owners have found success on the platform. Others haven\u2019t been so lucky. While the reasons for those failures have varied, the successful sellers point to a few common threads \u2015 the community feel, the direct line of communication with customers.\n\nWe talked to three people to find out what life is really like as a moneymaking Etsy-preneur. Remember that the platform has been integral to their success, so they don\u2019t have a lot of negative things to say about it. And their particular situations aren\u2019t necessarily the norm, but they show the potential of the online marketplace.\n\nRead their stories below.\n\nReuben Reuel, Demestik\n\nRayon Richards for HuffPost Reuben Reuel in his womenswear studio in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.\n\nIn 2012, Reuben Reuel was laid off from his job at a bedding company. The then-26-year-old gave himself two options for moving forward: work for another company or work for himself. At first, he found a job with a new employer, but that only lasted about two weeks. Reuel said he cried every day knowing he wasn\u2019t doing what he really wanted to be doing.\n\nHe decided to try option two, which meant starting his own fashion line, Demestik. His brand uses fabrics with traditional African wax block prints \u2015 which he often sources in New York City \u2015 to create modern womenswear that\u2019s manufactured in the United States.\n\nReuel\u2019s Etsy store has a five-star rating, compiled from more than 950 customer reviews, and has logged more than 5,000 sales. He has designed garments worn by the likes of Beyonc\u00e9 and singer-actress Jill Scott, among other notable women.\n\nThe designer, now 33, declined to share his annual income, but said he\u2019s able to fully support himself and pay all his bills \u2015 which include rent for an apartment and a separate studio in Brooklyn \u2015 with the money he makes from Demestik. Reuel also has a separate website for Demestik now, though when he launched the brand, Etsy was his main sales outlet.\n\nIt all started with his first collection \u2015 a line of two shirts and four dresses. He posted them on Etsy at a friend\u2019s suggestion. He said he was open to seeing \u201cwhat it\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\nToday, Reuel smiles just thinking about his first sale. \u201cI know exactly who bought from me my first sale. I actually posted it on my Facebook page when it happened,\u201d he said.\n\nRayon Richards for HuffPost \u201cIt\u2019s always a gamble in a way, but I knew there was a market for my product,\" Reuel said. \"I think that\u2019s the major key that keeps me going.\u201d\n\n\u201cEtsy has this really cute thing where, if you have your volume on on your phone, when you get a sale, it makes a cha-ching noise. I had my ringer on and all of a sudden I heard \u2018Cha-ching!\u2019 and I was like, \u2018What is that?\u2019 It was my first sale,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt validated, like, OK, what I\u2019ve created means something to someone. There is a woman who actually wants to wear this specific dress.\u201d\n\nJoining Etsy was easy, Reuel said, for a number of reasons: \u201cIt was easy to connect with people, easy to sell, easy to reach out to different people from a marketing standpoint. You\u2019re connected not only to the U.S. but other sellers from across the world.\u201d\n\nThat connection is important to him. Through his Etsy shop, Reuel said he\u2019s gained a faithful following and even become friends with some of his repeat customers.\n\n\u201cNow that we have social media and everyone\u2019s giving their life story on social media \u2015 celebrities, designers, musicians, everyone \u2015 it does feel good to know where [products are] coming from. It does feel good to know who it\u2019s going to. And the connections that I\u2019ve made with people [are] really a great thing to have, [instead of] just selling to a store and not even knowing who the woman that\u2019s wearing your clothing is.\u201d\n\nAmong those women who do wear Reuel\u2019s clothes are also singer Michelle Williams and Mindy Kaling, who purchased items directly through the Etsy store. (\u201cI was like, \u2018What the heck is this?! Why?\u2019\u201d he said, laughing.)\n\nBefore he started Demestik, Reuel said he was receiving less than $400 a week on unemployment. He called his foray into entrepreneurship \u201ca faith journey.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery day\u2019s a challenge. You never know when you\u2019re going to get an order,\u201d he said, noting there are days when he gets none and others when three or four will go through. \u201cIt\u2019s always a gamble in a way, but I knew there was a market for my product. I think that\u2019s the major key that keeps me going.\u201d\n\nReuel said he\u2019s been more successful financially working for himself than he was at any job in the past. He\u2019s also been able to employ other people, something he considers \u201cso rewarding.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hired myself and it was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made,\u201d he said.\n\nHe has no plans to leave Etsy anytime soon, but admitted he has thought of shutting down his shop on the platform. Ultimately though, he decided it was \u201cwiser to keep it open.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s where I\u2019ll stay because, again, I\u2019m able to reach a wider range of shoppers and customers without really having to do marketing,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not trying to appear as a fashion designer who\u2019s doing Fashion Week and all those things, the platform doesn\u2019t really deter my customers from shopping with me.\u201d\n\nAmy Yee, Maeven Vintage\n\nAmy Yee Amy Yee, founder of Maeven Vintage, in her Brooklyn studio.\n\nWhen Amy Yee, the Brooklyn, New York-based founder of Maeven Vintage, first started using eBay to sell vintage goods, it was a side hustle that kept her busy beyond her 9-to-5 job. But around 2008, following the financial crisis \u2015 \u201ca good time to quit your job and try something new,\u201d she quipped \u2015 Yee decided to explore other avenues.\n\nThat\u2019s when she discovered Etsy and ran with it.\n\n\u201cIt was a YSL black shirt dress,\u201d she said of the first item she sold. \u201cI put the listing up and it sold right away. It was so exciting to me that I described the item, priced it, and it flew off the shelf.\u201d\n\nMaeven Vintage has a five-star rating (averaged from more than 1,500 reviews) on the platform and more than 3,500 sales. Yee, 37, declined to disclose her income to HuffPost, but said that she\u2019s able to take a full-time salary.\n\nFor Yee, being successful means \u201cmaking matches with vintage finds and customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was hooked from that first sale, and I just kept listing,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople thought I was crazy. It doesn\u2019t sound so far-fetched to say you\u2019re going to be a seller on Etsy [now]. People didn\u2019t even really know about the marketplace 10 years ago.\u201d\n\nBut she said she\u2019s turned Maeven into something that can sustain her financially. Besides the Etsy outlet, Yee also has a separate website for Maeven. The amount of money she makes through the Etsy shop, she said, is \u201cproportional to how much time and effort\u201d she devotes to it.\n\nIn the earlier stages of building the business, Yee recalls selling merchandise out of the apartment she shared with her now-husband.\n\n\u201cAt one point, [he] said to me, \u2018I\u2019m living in a clothing store\u2019 \u2015 and he was right,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had clothing racks all around the apartment.\u201d\n\nEventually, her business was doing well enough that she could afford to rent a studio in Brooklyn. It was then, she said, that she started taking things more seriously and treating her former side hustle like a real business.\n\nAmy Yee A selection of vintage garments sold through Yee's shop.\n\nBut Etsy was where she learned how to be a vintage dealer. On the platform, she could easily track what types of things were selling and how much they were selling for, which helped her understand what her customers wanted. Thanks to the marketplace\u2019s backend tools, she said she could see where her customers were based and which keywords they used to find her.\n\n\u201cSelling on Etsy gave me more information to continue growing my business, and that\u2019s why I opened up my separate website,\u201d Yee said. \u201cI started selling in person, I did trade shows, I did markets, I did some wholesale to larger stores, but I don\u2019t think I could have done any of that had I not learned what I learned on Etsy and knew that it was sustainable as a full-time job.\u201d\n\nRunning an online shop has its challenges. Being part of a community that exists on the internet also means you\u2019re part of what Yee called \u201cthe feedback system\u201d \u2015 that is, the ability of customers to leave instant reviews. She said she\u2019s thought about whether \u201ca couple bad eggs could ruin it for me or take away my business.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true for anyone online,\u201d Yee added. \u201cYou for sure have to be aware of your reputation.\u201d\n\nA benefit of being on Etsy, though, is that she can quickly connect with customers if there\u2019s an issue with a purchase or they have any other questions. As a seller, Yee said, \u201cyou want to be given the chance to make something right if you\u2019ve genuinely made a mistake, because mistakes can happen.\u201d\n\nEtsy also offers room for growth and flexibility, Yee said, so that individuals can create their own brands on their own terms. And everyone, she added, has \u201cequal footing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody who has five listings will be featured the same way as somebody who has a thousand listings,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the beauty of being able to sell in a marketplace like Etsy.\u201d\n\nFor the foreseeable future at least, Yee said she plans to keep selling on Etsy.\n\n\u201cAs long as I\u2019m selling vintage, I\u2019ll be on Etsy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s where my customers are and it\u2019s been one of my most successful selling platforms.\u201d\n\nErin True, Urban Wood Goods\n\nAlyssa Schukar for HuffPost Erin True in her workshop in Gurnee, Illinois.\n\nWhen former art teacher Erin True discovered Etsy, she was \u201cblown away.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could type something in and then find the most unique, cool [items],\u201d she said.\n\nTrue, the founder of Illinois-based furniture company Urban Wood Goods, started selling on Etsy in 2010. She listed a single bench created with reclaimed wood after reading a magazine article on the topic.\n\n\u201cI had never heard of reclaimed wood before,\u201d she said. \u201cI was really intrigued by this idea. The photo I saw was this amazing piece of wood \u2015 I was like, \u2018Whoa, I gotta get my hands on something like that.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow, she\u2019s running a business that employs 19 full-time workers (aside from herself) and has seen roughly 20 to 30 percent growth year over year, she said. Her Etsy shop has a five-star rating, calculated from more than 450 reviews, and more than 3,200 sales.\n\nWhile Etsy was initially True\u2019s main avenue for selling, her products are now listed on sites like Wayfair and Houzz and on her own brand website. Still, she said that more people look at her offerings on Etsy than the other platforms.\n\nIt all began with what she called her \u201cwild goose chase\u201d to find the reclaimed wood she needed to recreate that bench she\u2019d seen in the magazine. Eventually, she wound up at a barn that she found online, about an hour outside of Chicago. There, she purchased her first pieces of this raw material. The man who owned the property let her choose the pieces she wanted, which True said made her feel like a kid in a candy store.\n\nShe transformed that wood into a bench and set it up in her house. Visitors would see it and compliment her, True said. That sparked a little curiosity: \u201cI said, \u2018If all these people coming into my home seem to like this bench I made, is it crazy to think I could make benches and sell them on the internet and ship them across the country?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen she told her family about her plans to open up a shop online, they were a little unsure of how she was going to pull it off. But she dived in.\n\nTwo days after she put that first bench on Etsy, it sold for $250 to someone in Detroit.\n\n\u201cI was super excited and then super panicked, because I was like, \u2018This is a problem. Number one, I just sold my favorite thing in my house. Number two, I have to deliver this to them somehow or ship it to them.\u2019 I know that sounds silly, but it was a real predicament,\u201d True recalled. \u201cIf you\u2019re just a regular person, you\u2019re not used to shipping FedEx or UPS. And it was a different time. Shipments are common now. Furniture wasn\u2019t something you bought online [then].\u201d\n\nBeing on Etsy allowed True, like Yee and Reuel, to connect with the community of buyers looking for unique and/or handmade items.\n\n\u201cWhen you have 100,000 people looking at your product, you can make a successful business,\u201d she said. \u201cI think one of the biggest challenges is having people that will look \u2015 just the eyes on what you\u2019re doing. \u2026 We get four times the traffic on Etsy than we do anywhere else. Even selling on a behemoth like Wayfair or Houzz, the sales we can generate from Etsy are crazy compared to any of them. I think it has to do with the community.\u201d\n\nAlyssa Schukar for HuffPost True speaks with her operations manager, Andrew Gebhardt, in the Urban Wood Goods shop.\n\nRight from the get-go, Urban Wood Goods was profitable, True said.\n\n\u201cI want to say my first year in business the revenue was probably $35,000, and then it jumped to $635,000 the next year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was very drastic. And that\u2019s not all Etsy sales, but most of it was as a result of Etsy.\u201d\n\nIn those early days, True said the pace at which orders were coming in was \u201camazing\u201d and it seemed like her company was the company for furniture-making on Etsy. Now, there are plenty of competitors \u2015 \u201chundreds of thousands of people trying to do the same thing you\u2019re doing\u201d \u2015 but she said she doesn\u2019t worry about them \u201cbecause you can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhen she started, True was doing everything on her own. In 2011, her second year on Etsy, she was able to hire her first employee, which she considered a major turning point for Urban Wood Goods. Now, those 19 employees include another designer, a bookkeeper and two sales people.\n\n\u201cI started this business in 2010 and it\u2019s 2018. I kind of pinch myself,\u201d True said. \u201cYou never want it to go away, the demand for what you\u2019re doing. Along the line, people have told me this is a fad \u2015 you get nervous about that. But it continues to resonate with people and people continue to want something unique and special and made for them.\u201d\n\nThat last thought could be the credo of all Etsy sellers striving after their dream online."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Laura Paddison", "title": "4 Things To Do Instead Of Shopping In Black Friday's Frenzy Of Consumerism", "description": "Trust us, you'll feel better for it.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/avoid-black-friday-consumerism_us_5bed7b3fe4b03af892677852", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf596ff220000f605de3efc.jpeg?cache=P5WbWAURnv&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T10:45:10Z", "content": "The annual buying bonanza that is Black Friday is upon us.

If everyone in the world lived like Americans, according to ASAPscience, we would need 4.1 Earths to sustain consumption levels.\n\n\u201cOur consumerism \u2015 defined as shopping for shopping\u2019s sake, to feel better, be social or validate ourselves \u2015 means we buy even if we don\u2019t need something new,\u201d Lu Yen Roloff, communications and engagement lead at Greenpeace International, told HuffPost. \u201cWe buy and throw away too much and replace things too quickly.\u201d In other words, we are caught in the spokes of a system that drives destruction.\n\nBut there is a movement that is starting to reject the call of advertisers and brands to buy ever more stuff. Most of it starts local and it prioritizes sharing, upcycling, making things, and giving time and even money.\n\nHere are four things you could do this Black Friday, other than buying stuff.\n\nMake Or Mend Something\n\nWhy not learn how to make something new or how to fix the stuff you already own?\n\nGreenpeace puts on an annual campaign called MAKE SMTHNG, which runs from Black Friday until Dec. 2 in cities across 28 countries. It\u2019s a global festival encouraging people to create not consume by helping them repair, upcycle, share and reuse. It includes events covering everything from mending clothes and building toys to making your own cleaning products and growing your own food.\n\nThe idea, said Roloff, is to offer \u201ca fun and creative way out of our wasteful and useless consumerism [and] get together with friends and your community.\u201d\n\nullstein bild via Getty Images The Repair Cafe movement was set up in 2009 in the Netherlands by Martine Postma.\n\nOr you could find a local Repair Caf\u00e9, which will help you with the tools and skills you need to fix anything from clothes and furniture to electronics. The idea started in Amsterdam in 2009 but has spread, and now there are more than 1,500 Repair Caf\u00e9s worldwide. You simply bring in your broken items and specialists help you repair them for free. The aim is simple: reduce waste by keeping resources in use, rather than in landfills. If there\u2019s not one near you, you can always start one.\n\nDonate To Charity\n\nIf you have some cash to spare, however small an amount, it can really help nonprofit organizations. \u201cThink about what types of causes are important to you,\u201d said Eileen Heisman, CEO and president of the National Philanthropic Trust. \u201cThen, take 10 minutes to research charities that match with your personal mission.\u201d\n\nHeisman advised that you can make more impact with larger gifts to fewer charities. \u201cIt is always better to give one charity $100 rather than five charities $20,\u201d she noted. And if this isn\u2019t a year you are able to make a financial donation, she said, \u201ccommit now to donating your time by volunteering. Also, you can check out your favorite charity\u2019s wish list for critical items you can pick up on your next shopping trip.\u201d\n\nVolunteer Your Time\n\nAbout a quarter of Americans volunteer for some kind of formal organization. Of course, it can be very hard to find the time to do this in between working, caring for friends and family, and sleeping \u2015 but for those who can, it may be extremely rewarding.\n\nMany organizations will be overwhelmed with offers around Thanksgiving and tend to prefer a more long-term commitment than one day, but you could use this time to research which volunteer opportunities might suit you.\n\n\u201cThe need and opportunity to support people is year-round,\u201d said Tanisha Smith of Volunteers of America. VOA works with more than 60,000 volunteers a year and is seeking people for everything from helping host birthday parties for children living in shelters and mentors for foster kids to helping at community food bank centers.\n\nJohn Sciulli via Getty Images Actress Betsy Brandt volunteers with Feeding America and the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank in California.\n\n\u201cWhether episodic or long term, volunteering offers enriching and often transformative experiences that stay with you well after the activity and reap personal rewards and inspire you for years to come,\u201d Smith said.\n\nConnect With Nature\n\nWhile consumerism doesn\u2019t seem to make us happy, some studies suggest that connecting with nature can.\n\n\u201cIn the last five to 10 years there\u2019s been a huge amount of empirical research that points to the very direct health benefits [of connecting to nature] \u2015 everything from lowering your blood pressure to feeling more connected with people,\u201d said David Case of conservation communications firm DJ Case and Associates, who co-authored one such study.\n\nWand_Prapan via Getty Images Studies suggest connecting with nature brings health and well-being benefits.\n\nInstead of spending Black Friday struggling against a wave of other shoppers or hunched over a laptop, you could head outside.\n\n\u201cWe often picture engaging with nature or being part of nature as these faraway experiences \u2015 the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone,\u201d Case said. But it needn\u2019t be so grand. He suggested a trip to a local park or a trail in the city, \u201cactivities you can go to in your backyard or down the street, or the next county over.\u201d\n\nFor more content and to be part of the \u201cThis New World\u201d community, follow our Facebook page."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Lee Moran", "title": "Eddie Redmayne Is Under No Illusion About James Corden\u2019s Magic Skills", "description": "\"The Late Late Show\" host needs to brush up on his tricks.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eddie-redmayne-james-corden-wizard-test-skit_us_5bf67ed3e4b0771fb6b619ef", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf683112100009c06ca28f1.jpeg?cache=2X1HzLiDeg&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T10:31:03Z", "content": "Don\u2019t expect to see James Corden joining The Magic Circle society anytime soon, if this comedy bit is anything to go by. \u201cThe Late Late Show\u201d host on Wednesday pretended to take his wizarding exam in front of actor Eddie Redmayne, the British star of Harry Po\u2026 [+192 chars]", "fulltext": "Don\u2019t expect to see James Corden joining the Magic Circle society anytime soon, if this comedy bit is anything to go by.\n\n\u201cThe Late Late Show\u201d host on Wednesday pretended to take his wizarding exam in front of actor Eddie Redmayne, the star of \u201cHarry Potter\u201d franchise spinoff \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\u201d\n\nBut it didn\u2019t go according to plan \u2014 and Redmayne was left less than impressed by Corden\u2019s \u201ctricks.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Lee Moran", "title": "Trump\u2019s Fox News Interview Gets Filtered On \u2018The Tonight Show\u2019", "description": "Trump's sit-down with Fox News anchor Chris Wallace received a Snapchat-style reworking.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jimmy-fallon-donald-trump-filters_us_5bf67415e4b03b230f9ebdd7", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf675c8260000cd03847dc0.png?cache=v1EuBIJNwV&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T09:37:08Z", "content": "\u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d host Jimmy Fallon put an amusing spin on President Donald Trump\u2019s interview with Fox News host Chris Wallace, that aired at the weekend.

We were friends and brothers. I feel close to all of them.\u201d\n\nHours before the attack, he was aboard the minesweeper USS Condor as it patrolled the harbor\u2019s east entrance when he and others saw the periscope of a Japanese submarine. They notified a destroyer that sunk it shortly before Japanese bombers arrived to strafe the harbor.\n\nBy then Chavez, who had worked through the early morning hours, had gone to his nearby home to sleep, ordering his wife not to wake him because he had been up all night.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like I only slept about 10 minutes when she called me and said, \u2018We\u2019re being attacked,\u2019\u201d he recalled in 2016. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Who is going to attack us?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018The Japanese are here, and they\u2019re attacking everything.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe ran back to the harbor to find it in flames.\n\nChavez would spend the next week there, working around the clock sifting through the destruction that had crippled the U.S. Navy\u2019s Pacific fleet.\n\nLater he was assigned to the transport ship USS La Salle, ferrying troops, tanks and other equipment to war-torn islands across the Pacific, from Guadalcanal to Okinawa.\n\nAlthough never wounded, he left the military in 1945 suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder that left him anxious and shaking.\n\nReturning to San Diego, where he had grown up, he took a job as a landscaper and groundskeeper, attributing the outdoors, a healthy diet and a strict workout program that he continued into his early 100s with restoring his health.\n\n\u201cHe loved trees and he dearly loved plants and he knew everything about a plant or tree that you could possibly want to know,\u201d his daughter said Wednesday with a chuckle. \u201cAnd he finally retired when he was 95.\u201d\n\nStill, he would not talk about Pearl Harbor for decades. Then, on a last-minute whim, he decided to return to Hawaii in 1991 for ceremonies marking the attack\u2019s 50th anniversary.\n\n\u201cThen we did the 55th, the 60th, the 65th and the 70th, and from then on we went to every one,\u201d his daughter recalled, adding that until Chavez\u2019s health began to fail he had planned to attend this year\u2019s gathering next month.\n\nBorn March 12, 1912, in San Bernardino, California, to Mexican immigrant parents, Chavez moved to San Diego as a child, where his family ran a wholesale flower business. He joined the Navy in 1938.\n\nIn his later years, as he became well known as the attack\u2019s oldest military survivor, he\u2019d be approached at memorial services and other events and asked for his autograph or to pose for pictures. He always maintained that those events were not about him, however, but about those who gave their lives.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d just shrug his shoulders and shake his head and say, \u2018I was just doing my job,\u2019\u201d said his daughter. \u201cHe was just a very nice, quiet man. He never hollered about anything, and he was always pleasant to everybody.\u201d\n\nChavez was preceded in death by his wife, Margaret. His daughter is his only survivor.\n\nFuneral services are pending.\n\n___"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Nick Visser", "title": "Trump may move forward on threats to make asylum seekers wait in Mexico: Report", "description": "It's unclear if the rule would stand up in court after a federal judge this week ordered the government to process all asylum applications.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-asylum-seekers-wait-mexico_us_5bf631c0e4b03b230f9e91d9", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf632a0210000b406ca28d4.jpeg?cache=irvMIwrDz7&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T05:28:50Z", "content": "The Trump administration is preparing to unveil a plan that would force asylum seekers from Central America to wait in Mexico while their applications are being processed, according to a report late Wednesday in The Washington Post.

Officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and Citizenship and Immigration Services reportedly met to discuss what kind of regulation could be implemented.\n\nThe news comes after a whirlwind several weeks in which the president lambasted a caravan of migrants traveling from Central America on foot, up through the subcontinent and into Mexico, with plans of applying for asylum at the United States\u2019 southern border. The caravan grew to include several thousand people, many fleeing violence, but Trump painted those traveling in the group as gang members and criminals. He also deployed thousands of military troops to the border, many of whom are still there.\n\nThe president\u2019s critics accused him of fearmongering in an attempt to drum up votes ahead of this month\u2019s midterm elections, and he has barely mentioned the caravan since the Nov. 6 election.\n\nMany members of the caravan are now close to the border, in Tijuana, effectively in limbo as they wait for interviews to begin their asylum applications or for word on the government\u2019s new policies."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Dominique Mosbergen", "title": "Iran Burns Trump With \u2018Rake\u2019 Jab: \u2018Perhaps We\u2019re Also Responsible For Fires\u2019", "description": "The country's foreign minister skewered Trump for his \"shameful\" statement supporting Saudi Arabia.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iran-trump-rake-california-fires-saudi-arabia_us_5bf624f9e4b0771fb6b5cc49", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf62a9c3c00008a040ebbfb.jpeg?cache=NTCORFajOJ&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-22T04:16:46Z", "content": "Iran\u2019s foreign minister took a swipe at President Donald Trump in a barbed Wednesday tweet.
