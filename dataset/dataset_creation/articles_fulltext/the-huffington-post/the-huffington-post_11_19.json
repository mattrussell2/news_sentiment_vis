Sanders was placed in the white sedan of a hospital employee named David.\n\nAs the car attempted to escape what now has been named the Camp wildfire \u2014 the deadliest such blaze in California history \u2014 terror arose. Propane tanks exploded and what Sanders described as a \u201cwindstorm of fire\u201d surrounded the road, per CNN.\n\nThere was gridlock and people were abandoning their cars in the road in fear of being burned alive. The fire melted the sedan\u2019s plastic taillights.\n\n\u201cI thought I wasn\u2019t going to make it, for sure,\u201d Sanders told CNN. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure any of us were going to make it.

During his tenure at ORR, the agency also came under fire for its handling of children separated from their parents at the border, its restrictions on releasing unaccompanied minors and its low refugee resettlement numbers.\n\nLloyd, previously a lawyer for the Catholic group Knights of Columbus, told the Daily Caller he has valued his time at ORR, but added he is \u201cexcited to take on this new challenge.\u201d\n\nLloyd took the unprecedented step of requiring any minor in ORR custody who wanted an abortion to get his personal sign-off, and once blocked an abortion for a teen who was pregnant as result of a rape. ORR was forced to offer access to abortion to minors in custody after a lawsuit by the ACLU.\n\nPlanned Parenthood Federation of America, which has been highly critical of Lloyd\u2019s treatment of pregnant girls in ORR custody, applauded his departure but argued he should be out of government entirely.\n\n\u201cPapering over his failure by moving him elsewhere in the federal government isn\u2019t good enough,\u201d Dana Singiser, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement. \u201cLloyd is a national disgrace and he has proven himself unfit to serve in the administration in any capacity.\u201d\n\nAs ORR Director, Lloyd also made it more difficult for child migrants to leave jail-like secured facilities by requiring his personal sign-off before making those transfers. A federal judge blocked that policy temporarily in June.\n\nLloyd was unhappy in the role, which subjected him to intense media scrutiny after the Trump administration enacted the family separation policy in May of this year, according to The Daily Caller.\n\nBut the decision to shuffle him into a new role appeared to stem partly from Lloyd\u2019s mishandling of the child separation crisis, according to Politico.

Troops involved in logistics will also be able to depart now that base camps have been built, while helicopter pilots, medical personnel and engineers who can help close traffic at ports of entry will stay on longer, Politico reported.\n\nStill, the reduction in troop levels now \u2015 after Trump largely stopped tweeting or talking about the caravans post-midterm elections, but while thousands of migrants are still en route to the U.S. \u2015 is likely to bolster critics who said the deployment was more about pre-election fear-mongering than responding to a need.\n\nEric Gay/Associated Press. Members of the U.S. military install multiple tiers of concertina wire along the banks of the Rio Grande near the Juarez-Lincoln Bridge at the U.S.-Mexico border, Friday, Nov. 16, 2018, in Laredo, Texas.\n\nThe Trump administration announced plans to deploy thousands of active-duty troops to the border in late October, amid the president\u2019s frequent campaign refrains and tweets about incoming migrant caravans. Officials insisted it wasn\u2019t a stunt, although the number of troops to be sent exceeded the first caravan\u2019s numbers at that time and the military is barred from conducting immigration arrests. Trump said at one point that he might send as many as 15,000 troops to the border, but as of last week, had deployed about 5,900.\n\nThe mission was initially called \u201cOperation Faithful Patriot,\u201d but the Pentagon dropped that name after the midterm elections, opting to refer to it as supporting border efforts instead.\n\n\u201cWe determined the missions as absolutely legal and this was also reviewed by Department of Justice lawyers, it\u2019s obviously a moral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen,\u201d Defense Secretary James Mattis said last week.\n\nOn Monday, Department of Homeland Security officials said security at the border is still very much at risk.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection closed down northbound traffic at a port of entry in San Ysidro, California, for three hours \u2015 ending around 6:25 a.m. \u2015 on Monday after receiving intelligence that some migrants were considering rushing through lanes for automobiles.\n\nThere are between 8,500 to 10,500 migrants currently seeking to go to the U.S., about 6,000 of them waiting to cross in San Ysidro, officials told reporters during a briefing call on Monday, declining to be quoted by name.\n\nAsylum-seekers are encouraged to go to ports of entry to ask for help, but are often forced to wait weeks or months to do so because the U.S. government admits only a limited number at a time for processing. DHS officials argued that agents at ports of entry have other responsibilities beyond screening asylum-seekers.\n\nAlthough migrants could previously seek asylum either at ports of entry or after entering illegally, Trump took action earlier this month to bar those protections for anyone who crossed the border without authorization. That was meant to \u201cfunnel\u201d asylum-seekers to ports of entry, according to officials. The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups sued to block the policy and argued in court on Monday for a preliminary injunction."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Zach Carter", "title": "Bernie Sanders And Ro Khanna Have A Plan To Tackle Prescription Drug Rip-Offs", "description": "It's an attack on Big Pharma's monopolies.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-ro-khanna-prescription-drugs_us_5bf3192ce4b01909c808652f", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf3198a2100007406ca2803.jpeg?cache=Ptys2X0dI0&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T23:30:02Z", "content": "The problem with prescription drugs is simple: The U.S. government bestows long-term monopolies on pharmaceutical companies, immunizing them from the forces of market competition and public regulation.

As a result, Americans shoulder the highest drug prices in the world while receiving significantly poorer public health outcomes than most of the developed world.\n\nThere are a lot of ways to address that problem, but a new proposal from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) would attack prescription drug price-gouging at the source: the government-granted monopoly that gives Big Pharma unchecked pricing power.\n\n\u201cNo other country allows pharmaceutical companies to charge any price they want for any reason they want,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cSomebody in America today can walk into a pharmacy and find out that the medicine they have been using for years can double, triple or quadruple literally overnight. That needs to change.\u201d\n\nEvery year, the United States spends over $1,200 per person on pharmaceuticals, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That\u2019s more than double the rate in the United Kingdom and nearly double the rate in France \u2015 and yet the typical French citizen can expect to live more than four years longer than the typical American, and those in the United Kingdom enjoy three extra years, on average, relative to their American counterparts, according to the World Health Organization. The disparities are even more dramatic between the U.S. and Scandinavian countries.\n\nIn 2015, Bloomberg News compared different countries\u2019 spending on a host of major prescription drugs. A months\u2019 supply of the arthritis treatment Humira cost about $2,500 in the U.S. \u2015 roughly 50 percent more than the same supply of the same drug in Germany, and more than double the price in Canada and the U.K. The asthma medication Advair runs about $150 a month in the U.S. \u2014 roughly double the price of the same drug in Canada and triple its cost in Japan. For cutting-edge cancer drugs, prices in the U.S. exceed those in other countries by several thousand dollars per month.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sanders and Khanna will unveil a new bill that would direct the secretary of Health and Human Services to authorize generic competition for any name-brand drug whose average domestic cost exceeds the median price in five reference countries: Canada, the U.K., Germany, France and Japan.\n\n\u201cThe government is giving an exclusive monopoly to pharmaceuticals,\u201d Khanna told HuffPost. \u201cIf a company abuses that grant by fleecing American consumers, then they lose that privilege, that property grant, that subsidy from the government.\u201d\n\nIf the bill \u2014 dubbed The Prescription Drug Price Relief Act \u2014 were to become law, experts anticipate that drug companies would dramatically reduce prices rather than risk ceding market share to a generic competitor. \u201cNo company would want to lose its legal monopoly as a consequence of charging U.S. residents prices higher than in the reference countries,\u201d said Jamie Love, director of Knowledge Ecology International, a nonprofit that specializes in intellectual property issues.\n\nThe bill from Sanders and Khanna isn\u2019t going to become law anytime soon. It faces fervent opposition from Republicans, who will still control the Senate when Congress reconvenes next year. Even getting a vote in the House will depend on whether the Democrats in charge of key committees decide to greenlight it \u2015 a choice that will likely depend at least in part on the whims of top leadership.\n\nBut the legislation nevertheless sends a statement about the priorities of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and its intent to deliver on the campaign promises Democrats issued around the 2018 midterms, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s election night pledge to \u201ctake real, very, very strong legislative action to negotiate down the price control of prescription drugs.\u201d\n\nAmerican consumers pay far too much for drugs, not because it is costly to manufacture them, or even because of the expense of research and development. We pay too much because the U.S. government grants patents and other monopolies to brand-name drug makers. Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen\n\nPharmaceutical firms typically argue that long-term monopolies are necessary to justify the money they spend on research and development. And major drug companies do spend billions of dollars a year on R&D \u2015 but not nearly as much as they spend on marketing, meaning that most of the costs recouped by monopoly profits aren\u2019t essential to groundbreaking science. Nearly all research funded by pharmaceutical companies, moreover, piggybacks on government-backed research conducted by the National Institutes of Health. One study published earlier this year concluded that every one of the 210 new drugs approved by the FDA between 2010 and 2016 relied on at least some government-funded research, reflecting over $100 billion of public investment.\n\n\u201cAmerican consumers pay far too much for drugs, not because it is costly to manufacture them, or even because of the expense of research and development,\u201d said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a public interest nonprofit. \u201cWe pay too much because the U.S. government grants patents and other monopolies to brand-name drug makers, and then stands aside as Big Pharma exploits those monopolies to price gouge.\u201d\n\nThe United States is in a class by itself on prescription drug costs, but the five reference countries included in the Sanders bill are a relatively generous comparison pool. Three of them \u2015 Germany, Japan and Canada \u2015 are in the top five in per-capita pharmaceutical spending among OECD nations. International reference pricing is common among wealthy nations, with 29 of 31 European Union nations taking foreign drug prices into account when considering domestic price policy, according to the European Commission.\n\nPatents on prescription drugs are a longstanding feature of both American law and international trade agreements, in part due to the outsized influence of the pharmaceutical lobby within the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. But international law provides various exceptions patent-holders\u2019 privileges when it comes to public health \u2015 which is why so many countries party to the World Trade Organization and other trade treaties can obtain lower drug prices than the U.S. does. Though Khanna and Sanders crafted their bill to crack down on the monopoly, the legislation would not technically violate a drug company\u2019s patent \u2015 just change the legal substance of what that patent secured."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Kimberly Yam", "title": "Steven Yeun Remembers Feeling Like An Outsider As An Immigrant In Kindergarten", "description": "\"I remember asking my dad the first English words that I learned ...

Attacking Obamacare won\u2019t work any longer. The midterms proved that it\u2019s now the Democrats\u2019 issue to use against him and the GOP. Promising to cut taxes is empty, as the massive tax bill was a dud. It was a payout to the rich and corporations, with little for average Americans.\n\nTrump broke his promise to his supporters that he would \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d by actually filling it up further: Now House Democrats will use investigations to exploit the corruption of Trump and his Cabinet, which will garner enormous media attention.\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s promise to protect Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid was exposed as phony when he allowed Republicans to say several times in the past year that they would soon make cuts to these programs. Once again, it will be Democrats who will save them, something voters entrusted them to do by electing them to lead the House.\n\nIt\u2019s clear Trump knows all of this, consciously or not, and the last two weeks have seen him behave more erratically than any period since he entered the White House.\n\nFrom not leaving his hotel room in Paris to honor America\u2019s war dead to refusing to visit Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day, Trump showed how small \u2015 and gloomy \u2015 he\u2019s feeling after the repudiation of the midterms. Visiting cemeteries is always a sad task, after all, and surely it\u2019s more grim if you\u2019re already feeling very down.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has reportedly been lashing out at White House aides, who try to avoid him, and questioning the loyalty of Vice President Mike Pence \u2015 something the president vehemently denied.\n\nIt\u2019s sinking in for everyone both in and out of the White House that the midterms were a disaster for Trump and the GOP.\n\nHe later admitted he probably \u201cshould have\u201d gone to Arlington, but made it worse by offering the excuse that he was \u201cextremely busy making calls.\u201d He sent out tweets of support to Californians battling devastating wildfires, but only after his first callous remarks blamed poor \u201cforest management\u201d without even expressing his sorrow for those who died. But, again, he only made it worse when he visited the state and implied Californians were to blame because they should have been \u201craking\u201d the forest floors to prevent fires.\n\nFiring Jeff Sessions and replacing him with Matt Whitaker as acting attorney general immediately after the election further revealed his grave fears of the Mueller probe, and showed how far he\u2019ll go to try to stop it.\n\nContrary to his election night claims, it\u2019s sinking in for everyone both in and out of the White House that the midterms were a disaster for Trump and the GOP.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Trump\u2019s assaults on so many groups \u2015 from African-American NFL players to transgender Americans \u2015 may have helped galvanize his base. But Trump\u2019s two years in office energized Democrats equally or more so.\n\nAnd it\u2019s his attacks on immigrants that may have done the most damage, outweighing any possible upside for him, by bringing so many more people into the political process. This is especially true in regard to the Senate and looking forward to Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election aspirations as well.\n\nRepublicans picked up Democratic Senate seats in overwhelmingly white states that voted for Trump in 2016 \u2015 North Dakota, Indiana and Missouri. But it should be pointed out that Sens. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) and Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) played into Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric: Both said they were concerned about the caravan of migrants and supported Trump\u2019s wall on the border.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke, however, spoke out forcefully against Trump\u2019s brutal war on immigrants, and, in a stunner for Texas, lost by only 2.6 percentage points against Sen. Ted Cruz, shading Texas purple for the presidential race. Republican Sen. Dean Heller lost in Nevada, as did Republican Nevada gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt. The state, which Hillary Clinton won in 2016, now seems out of reach for Trump.\n\nAnd Arizona elected its first Democrat to an open Senate seat there since the 1970s, putting that state in play for 2020. All three are states in which large Latino populations and other groups who cared about the attacks on immigrants were mobilized, activating many people who might not vote regularly to turn out.\n\nThe Associated Press It\u2019s clear Trump knows, consciously or not, he's in rough shape for the 2020 election and the last two weeks have seen him behave more erratically than any period since he entered the White House.\n\nAssaulting immigrants also seemed to backfire in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, the three states Trump narrowly won in 2016, and which he\u2019ll need again. Democratic senators up for re-election in those states won by big margins \u2015 by speaking out forcefully against Trump. The governors\u2019 seats in Wisconsin and Michigan flipped to blue, and Pennsylvania re-elected a Democratic governor. In both Michigan and Pennsylvania, the Democratic gubernatorial candidates won by 9 points or more.\n\nJust as in Arizona, Nevada and Texas, what was markedly different in these states from 2016 was who turned out to vote.\n\nIn Michigan, for example, there was slightly higher overall turnout for the 2016 presidential election year, but there was actually a decrease in turnout that year in Democratic-leaning urban counties while rural counties, which voted for Trump, had much stronger turnout than 2012. In 2018, however, Michigan saw the largest turnout statewide for a midterm election in nearly 50 years, with very strong turnout in urban Democratic-leaning counties. It\u2019s not shocking then that Democrats \u2015 and women in particular \u2015 trounced in statewide races, including secretary of state and attorney general in addition to the gubernatorial race.\n\nTrump\u2019s conspiracies about caravan invaders doesn\u2019t appear to have had any positive effect for him in these states in 2018, and it\u2019s doubtful anything similar would in 2020. Democratic Senate candidates in those states hammered Trump on Social Security and health care, in addition to hitting back on his immigration scares. Pointing to those states, Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg noted that Democrats didn\u2019t just win over suburban white women on these issues \u2015 they peeled off some of Trump\u2019s core working-class white and rural voters.\n\nTrump may not know the details of all this \u2015 surely not as well as GOP strategists know them and are learning about them more as the outcome of the midterms comes into sharper view. But he seems to intuitively know that the issues he perceived as his magic bullets did not work \u2015 and may not work again.\n\nThat, along with the Russia probe and the specter of House Democrats investigating an array of questions potentially involving his family and finances, has added massively to Trump\u2019s already considerable paranoia."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Lydia O'Connor", "title": "Camp Fire Toll Remains Unclear With Nearly 1,000 People Still Listed As Missing", "description": "Seventy-seven people have been confirmed dead in California\u2019s most destructive wildfire in history.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/camp-fire-missing-persons_us_5bf3164de4b01909c8086197", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf32a87220000a005de3e45.jpeg?cache=o3Z266TFQc&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T22:33:21Z", "content": "Although Northern California\u2019s Camp wildfire has been burning for more than 10 days and is now two-thirds contained, Butte County residents are still grappling with a massive missing persons list and uncertainty over what new dangers an approaching rainstorm \u2026 [+2248 chars]", "fulltext": "Although Northern California\u2019s Camp wildfire has been burning for more than 10 days and is now two-thirds contained, Butte County residents are still grappling with a massive missing persons list and uncertainty over what new dangers an approaching rainstorm could bring.\n\nAuthorities have confirmed 77 fatalities in the unprecedented blaze, which has burned 151,000 acres and destroyed nearly 13,000 structures.

The group has been implicated in acts of political violence across the country in the last two years, but has nevertheless been embraced by certain factions of the Republican party.\n\nMashable Tech Gavin McInnes, founder of the neo-fascist gang the Proud Boys.\n\nThe internal affairs report \u2014 provided to HuffPost by the government transparency group Property of the People \u2014 was written by Michael McCabe, headquarters commander at the Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\n\u201cThe FBI has warned local law enforcement that the Proud Boys are actively recruiting in the Pacific Northwest and that some in the group have contributed to the escalation of violence at political rallies held on college campuses, and in cities like Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington,\u201d McCabe writes in the report.\n\nMcCabe told The Guardian that the FBI had classified the Proud Boys as \u201cextremist\u201d during a briefing.\n\nThe Proud Boys is explicitly anti-feminist, anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-transgender and anti-leftist. As an organization, it is also decidedly pro-President Trump. Its members often don red Make America Great Again hats with their black Fred Perry polo shirts.\n\nGavin McInnes, who co-founded Vice before leaving the media company in 2008, founded the Proud Boys and often incites its members to commit acts of violence. \u201cFighting solves everything,\u201d he has said.\n\nIn October, McInnes spoke at the Metropolitan Republican Club in Manhattan, where he re-enacted the 1960 assassination of Inejiro Asanuma, a leader of the Japanese Socialist Party, who was killed on live television by a far-right ultranationalist. (McInnes called the assassination an \u201cinspiring moment.\u201d)\n\nAfter the event, Proud Boys members violently assaulted leftist protesters in Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. The NYPD arrested multiple Proud Boys members days later.\n\nAlthough McInnes has publicly rejected the racist \u201calt-right\u201d \u2014 which has allowed the Proud Boys to attract members of color \u2014 he has close ties to white nationalist figurehead Richard Spencer.\n\nJason Kessler, who organized the deadly white supremacist \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville in 2017, was a Proud Boy. Alexander Ramos, who claimed to be a Proud Boy, was convicted in the beating of Deandre Harris, a young black counterprotester, at the Charlottesville rally.\n\n\u201cThe FBI\u2019s failure to initially identify the Proud Boys as a violent organization allied with White Nationalists is hardly surprising given the FBI\u2019s long record of targeting social justice activists as terrorists while turning a blind eye to the threat posed by the radical right,\u201d Ryan Shapiro, executive director of Property of the People, told HuffPost in a statement.\n\nNew York Daily News via Getty Images A gang of Proud Boys attacks a group of anti-fascist protesters in Manhattan in October.\n\nDavid Gomez, a retired FBI executive and former head of the Seattle counter-terrorism program, told HuffPost that the FBI describing the Proud Boys as \u201cextremist\u201d is not some sort of formal designation, nor does it mean the agency is currently investigating the Proud Boys. Rather, it\u2019s simply how the FBI is apparently describing the group to local law enforcement agencies.\n\nGomez, however, says he doesn\u2019t care for the \u201cextremist\u201d label, and prefers more specific descriptors for violent organizations. \u201cWhat\u2019s extremist to you and extremist to me is very different,\u201d he said. In the Pacific Northwest, Gomez joked, \u201cI would probably be considered extremist because I\u2019m a conservative guy.\u201d\n\nThe FBI came under criticism in 2017 after leaked documents revealed the agency had created the term \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d The label, civil rights activists charged, was overly broad and could lead to law enforcement targeting black activist groups, as the FBI has done in the past.\n\nThe FBI would not elaborate for HuffPost why the agency might describe the Proud Boys as an \u201cextremist\u201d group.\n\n\u201cThe FBI does not and will not police ideology,\u201d the FBI said in a statement, adding that the agency does, however, share \u201cintelligence regarding possible threats\u201d with \u201cstate and local law enforcement partners.\u201d\n\nMcInnes \u2014 who has been photographed wearing a neo-Nazi band\u2019s T-shirt, who has described transgender people as \u201cgender n****rs,\u201d and who has called Muslims \u201cstupid\u201d and inbred \u2014 told HuffPost that the FBI calling the Proud Boys extremist is \u201cabsolutely insane and further proof we are living in a clown world.\u201d\n\n\u201cFalse allegations like this have innocent men facing serious charges,\u201d he said, referring to the Proud Boys arrested in New York. \u201cTwo of the five here in NY facing felonies are married to black women and have black kids. Way to go, media.\u201d\n\nThe Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which didn\u2019t immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment Monday, started investigating the Proud Boys after it was revealed one of its deputies, Erin Willey, was a member of the Proud Boys Girls.\n\nWilley was fired from the sheriff\u2019s office in July after a local newspaper, The Columbian, published a photo of her wearing a \u201cProud Boys Girls\u201d sweatshirt.\n\nDuring the course of the internal affairs investigation into her conduct, Willey told investigators she believed her allegedly abusive ex-boyfriend, a Proud Boys member named Graham Hayden Jorgensen, had sent the photo to the newspaper in an attempt to get her fired. (Jorgensen couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment.)\n\nThe internal affairs report states that Willey \u201cactively participated in the manufacturing, advertising and selling of Proud Boys Girls\u2019 merchandise on a website.\u201d\n\nThe report ultimately found that Willey, by being affiliated with the Proud Boys, violated at her oath of office and department policies regarding non-discrimination, harassment and off-duty conduct"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "HuffPost Video", "title": "White House Relents On Jim Acosta Press Pass Threat", "description": "The administration has pulled a 180 on its plans to once again revoke Jim Acosta\u2019s press pass.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-house-relents-on-jim-acosta-press-pass-threat_us_5bf32e27e4b0d9e7283c34e1", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf331193c00001b040ebb27.jpeg?cache=4vMOWt8MY3&ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T21:53:43Z", "content": "Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.

But while the letter indicates that Pelosi has a math problem, there are already signs she may be able to overcome the opposition.\n\nFor starters, there were supposed to be 17 signatures, as HuffPost reported last week. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), who is toying with a speaker run herself, was removed from the letter.\n\nFudge\u2019s office has not responded to a request for comment, but after Fudge met with Pelosi last week, it\u2019s possible the minority leader won her over. It\u2019s also possible \u2015 as one Democratic staffer involved in the efforts to dethrone Pelosi theorized \u2015 that Fudge wants to look more deferential as she prepares for a speaker run herself. Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), whose name is on this letter, removed himself from a letter in 2016 that sought to delay leadership elections when he ran against Pelosi for the minority leader position to make it look less like the letter was about his bid for the position.\n\nEither way, the letter also includes the signatures of Ben McAdams (D-Utah) and Anthony Brindisi (D-N.Y.), whose races haven\u2019t been called, meaning it\u2019s possible there are only 14 Democrats effectively pledged against Pelosi at the moment. She\u2019s likely to overcome such a threshold, depending on how large the Democratic majority shakes out to be. (Brindisi is expected to eventually win, while McAdams looks more likely to lose.)\n\nPelosi needs 218 votes on the House floor to be elected speaker, and the Democratic majority is expected to consist of around 234 members. The number of votes she needs could also change if some members vote \u201cpresent,\u201d thus lowering the majority threshold. In effect, a \u201cpresent\u201d vote would be a half-vote for Pelosi, and Pelosi could convince some Democrats now opposed to her to vote \u201cpresent\u201d \u2015 or get some moderate Republicans to do it.\n\nTom Williams via Getty Images \u201cIf your strategy relies upon Nancy Pelosi giving up, you will lose every single time,\u201d a senior Democratic aide told HuffPost.\n\nThere are other Democrats who have also signaled strong opposition to Pelosi. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.), Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) and Jason Crow (D-Colo.) have all repeatedly said they won\u2019t vote for her, and still others \u2015 Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.), Haley Stevens (D-Mich.), Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and Jared Golden (D-Maine), whose race also hasn\u2019t been called \u2015 have suggested they won\u2019t vote for her, though in less certain terms.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that those Democrats \u2015 all incoming freshman with the exception of Lamb \u2015 didn\u2019t sign the long-touted letter. They may be less solid in their opposition to Pelosi than many may think, and they may also be looking to avoid the backlash the letter is certain to bring.\n\nThe letter is signed mostly by white men, with the exception of Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) and Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.). Democrats opposed to Pelosi have already been slammed on Twitter for their opposition to the only female speaker to ever serve, and the hashtag #FiveWhiteMen \u2015 though factually inaccurate \u2015 has become a calling card of the backlash.\n\nPelosi allies were quick to jump on the letter Monday as proof that Pelosi will overcome the challenges.\n\n\u201cIf your strategy relies upon Nancy Pelosi giving up, you will lose every single time,\u201d a senior Democratic aide told HuffPost. The aide also pointed out that 94 percent of the Democratic caucus didn\u2019t sign the letter.\n\nOther Democratic aides also pointed out that the letter is vague. At 153 words, it doesn\u2019t say much other than that these members are committed to voting for \u201cnew leadership in both our Caucus meeting and on the House Floor.\u201d It doesn\u2019t vow to never support Pelosi, say, if there is a second or third ballot. And the letter actually praises Pelosi as a \u201chistoric figure whose leadership has been instrumental to some of our party\u2019s most important legislative achievements.\u201d\n\nBut Pelosi does still have a math problem.\n\nEven with Fudge off and some Democrats shaky, the opposition is still enough at this point to block Pelosi from being speaker. She will have to flip some Democrats, and flipping those incoming freshmen means asking them to go back on the promises they made to their constituents during their campaigns that they would not back Pelosi. Those Democrats, many of whom are in Republican-leaning districts, are being asked to go back on their word within the first hour they\u2019re in Congress.\n\nThe alternative is to get incumbents from safer districts \u2015 like Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) or Bill Foster (D-Ill.) \u2015 to flip. But that seems even more unlikely.\n\nThe last alternative is to rely on Republicans to get over the finish line. In a typically trollish move, President Donald Trump tweeted that he could get Pelosi the votes she needs from Republicans. \u201cShe deserves this victory, she earned it,\u201d he said.\n\nBut making a deal with Republicans to get the votes would also give Republicans effective veto power over a Democratic speaker, and a motion to vacate the chair could theoretically be called at any time. Such a situation is certainly one Democrats would like to avoid.\n\nPelosi, for her part, has signaled confidence throughout this whole experience that she will be elected. She said last week that she wouldn\u2019t need Republican votes and taunted Fudge about potentially running.\n\n\u201cCome on in, the water\u2019s fine,\u201d Pelosi said."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Arthur Delaney", "title": "Steve King Insists That Republicans Still Love Him", "description": "Republicans have not been proclaiming their love \u2014 at least not in public.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-king-steve-stivers_us_5bf30176e4b0d9e7283c002a", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf311af1d0000e5013133bc.jpeg?ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T20:32:44Z", "content": "WASHINGTON His own party\u2019s campaign chairman called him a white supremacist.

I had tears running down my face, I was on the ground, I was helpless.\u201d\n\nLove later discovered he was having a panic attack. He eventually got help for his condition and opened up about his experience in an essay for The Players\u2019 Tribune earlier this year.

Sitting down with other athletes like Michael Phelps, Channing Frye and Paul Pierce to have a candid conversation about their own well-being in a short web series called \u201cLocker Room Talk.\u201d The initiative, which is created in partnership with Schick, aims to tackle masculinity and mental health in the sports community.\n\n\u201cEverybody has their own story, whether it be depression or anxiety or anything they\u2019re dealing with, and it manifests in a different way,\u201d Love said. \u201cThat\u2019s why those [\u201cLocker Room Talk\u201d] conversations were very special. I didn\u2019t know what would come from it, but we had such great conversations where the guys opened up, and I think it\u2019s going to help a lot of people.\u201d\n\nThe interviews are a refreshing and needed contribution in the sports world, where an intent to not appear weak reigns supreme. In a five-part series published in August by ESPN, senior writer Jackie MacMullan unveiled some of the obstacles the National Basketball Players Association is just starting to address when it comes to mental health. It recently hired its first director of mental health and wellness, and it has stressed that there needs to be a more comprehensive approach to mental health in the league. But, as MacMullan reported, there\u2019s still a stigma \u201cattached to mental health that prompts many players to suffer in silence.\u201d\n\nLove wants to eradicate that stigma by shattering the perception that a mental health condition makes you fragile.\n\n\u201cI believe, as athletes, we\u2019re looked at as superhuman and indestructible,\u201d Love said. \u201cSuccess is not immune to depression. So athletes that are able to come out and share their stories is going to be super powerful moving forward.\u201d\n\nBut the impact can even go beyond that: The reality is that 1 in 5 American adults will experience a mental health issue in a given year. Experts say public figures like Love can help dispel some of the negative attitudes associated with mental health and encourage others to seek professional support.\n\n\u201cI believe, as athletes, we\u2019re looked at as superhuman and indestructible. Success is not immune to depression.\u201d - Kevin Love\n\nLove said also started The Kevin Love Fund, a charity aimed at bringing more awareness to mental health issues and start programs to better society\u2019s understanding around mental illness. One of his major goals with the organization is to fund and increase mental health literacy for young people.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping to have a class or course or workshop where people can go and work on their mental health, whether it\u2019s in high school or middle school,\u201d Love said. \u201cYou know, you learn about health and sex education, but you also need to learn about mental wellness and well-being. Because at that time, your mind and your body are changing at such an alarming rate that you don\u2019t know what to make of it. I certainly didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHow The Pro Deals With His Anxiety On A Daily Basis\n\nAs for his own mental health, Love explained breathing exercises help him manage his anxiety. Before he goes out on the court or whenever he feels panic building in his chest, he takes deep inhales and exhales, a process he learned through the Headspace meditation app.\n\n\u201cFor so long I didn\u2019t believe in that \u2015 that you can not only help yourself with stress and anxiety, but you can also heal yourself in the long run with breathing \u2015 but it moves energy through your body in a big way,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also credited professional help for helping him work through his anxiety in his Players\u2019 Tribune essay.\n\n\u201cI realized how many issues come from places that you may not realize until you really look into them,\u201d he wrote about going to therapy. \u201cI think it\u2019s easy to assume we know ourselves, but once you peel back the layers, it\u2019s amazing how much there is to still discover.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not alone and you shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of anything that you\u2019re going through.\u201d - Kevin Love\n\nUltimately, Love wants everyone \u2015 especially his young fans \u2015 to know that their mental health matters.

They also managed to flip districts Donald Trump won easily in the 2016 presidential election, as well as some districts that have been held by Republicans for decades.\n\nThe secret to their success was a fairly conventional, but somewhat surprising, campaign strategy during an election year that was mostly seen as a referendum on Trump: Talking about anything but the president.\n\nDemocrat Kendra Horn, for example, pulled off one of the biggest upsets of the night when she defeated two-term incumbent Steve Russell in Oklahoma\u2019s 5th Congressional District, a seat held by Republicans since 1975. Horn is the first Democratic woman to be elected to Congress from Oklahoma. Moreover, she\u2019s the third woman ever to be elected to Congress in the state\u2019s history. Her largely urban district went to Trump by almost 14 percentage points, prompting skepticism among national pollsters that it would be one of the seats that would flip this year.\n\n\u201cI think many people thought I might have lost my mind,\u201d Horn recalled last week at a post-election debrief in Washington, where she reflected on the moment she chose to run for office. \u201cI just believed in the power of talking to the community and saw there was a pathway there. I figured, if not me, who? If not now, when?\u201d\n\nHorn campaigned on left-wing issues like gun control, stricter campaign finance regulations, opposition to private prisons, and more funding for education \u2015 an issue that especially resonated with voters after an unprecedented strike by Oklahoma teachers this year. The GOP-controlled state slashed public school funding significantly since the Great Recession, while also pursuing tax cuts that have benefited businesses and the wealthy. The budget shortfalls left no money to pump into schools or salaries, leading to teacher shortages, overcrowded classrooms and even four-day school weeks.\n\n\u201cWhat we were hearing about was not the president, it was about education, it was about health care,\u201d Horn said at the event, organized by political data firm TargetSmart. \u201cWe had a massive teacher walkout in the spring, so education loomed particularly large. ... That really, really kept us out of that national narrative. If we were trying to follow that, it was like this ping pong, and that\u2019s not what people, when you got down to it, are concerned about.\u201d\n\nHorn resisted attempts by Russell to turn the race into a debate on national issues, avoiding direct criticism of Trump and associations with House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). It was a critical calculation in a state the president won more than 36 points in the last election. Focusing on the eye-catching headlines coming out of Washington, she explained, \u201dwould have been a no-win space\u201d for her campaign.\n\nWinning over traditionally conservative voters also helped moderate Democrat Jeff Van Drew defeat a right-wing Republican in New Jersey\u2019s 2nd District. The coastal South Jersey seat went up for grabs this year after GOP Rep. Frank LoBiondo decided to retire after 24 years in office. Its residents voted for President Barack Obama twice before swinging to Trump in the 2016 election.\n\nGranted, Van Drew was fortunate enough to have an extremely flawed opponent in Seth Grossman, who was abandoned by his national Republicans because of his bigoted statements about minorities and diversity. But Van Drew, a dentist and a state senator, didn\u2019t take the race for granted. He honed his pitch to Republican voters who liked Trump, but not some of his policies like offshore drilling.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Democrat Jeff Van Drew, a moderate, won a district in New Jersey that voted for Trump in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI think the big trick in a red district is to prove to folks you are running against a particularly bad Republican,\u201d Van Drew said. \u201cSo that they can feel like, \u2018Oh I\u2019m still Republican, but this one I\u2019m not voting for.\u2019\u201d\n\nFiguring out how best to approach wary Trump supporters wasn\u2019t always easy. Van Drew recalled meeting a married couple at a county fair who disagreed on how best to deal with Trump. While the husband seemed more apprehensive about Van Drew\u2019s answer on standing up to the president when the situation called for it, the wife urged him to \u201cknock [Trump] down and go after him \u2015 whatever you can do, go after him.\u201d\n\nThe most challenging aspect of the election for Van Drew, however, may have been overcoming deep-seated partisanship among the electorate. With talk of a blue wave before November, losing control of the House weighed heavily in the minds of many Republican voters who otherwise may have been more open to voting for a Democrat.\n\n\u201cSo many people came up to me and said, \u2018I really like you I want to vote for you, I do think we need some change but, quite frankly, I don\u2019t want to flip the House. I\u2019m a Republican, I don\u2019t want to flip the House. I think it\u2019s dangerous,\u2019\u201d Van Drew recalled. \u201cThat\u2019s a hard argument to have. ... That made it certainly more challenging.\u201d\n\nDemocrats dealt with the problem by having their candidates use more amorphous code words, like \u201cdysfunction,\u201d and \u201cchaos,\u201d to call for change in Washington, instead of attacking the president directly. It\u2019s a messaging strategy that is ironically similar to the anti-establishment \u201cDrain the swamp\u201d rallying cry that Trump and his campaign used in the 2016 election, one his administration has failed to deliver."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Andy Campbell", "title": "A Former Judge Beat His Wife Years Ago.

Wages have stagnated and young people, if they can, often prefer to spend their free time pursuing more meaningful experiences and ones that will boost their resumes.\n\nWorking a retail job was once a rite of passage for teenagers. It was stitched so deeply into the fabric of adolescence that stores were the obvious setting for period cult movies (Think: \u201cClerks\u201d and \u201cEmpire Records\u201d).\n\nAnd working retail didn\u2019t just come with decent wages. Some jobs also offered invaluable social currency. Getting hired at Abercrombie & Fitch during the late \u201990s and early aughts, for example, meant you were inarguably conventionally pretty.\n\nBut after the year 2000, employment rates among teenagers \u2015 and in the retail space in particular \u2015 started to drop, steeply, according to a report released last year by Pew Research Center. While employment figures are usually tied to the health of the economy, recessions weren\u2019t the key driver of the decline. Neither was the rise of Amazon or e-commerce. Fewer teens now work over summer break mostly because for many, it\u2019s not worth it. They also have better things to do: They take summer courses, get internships or volunteer to support organizations and communities in need, experts say.\n\nUp until 2000, about half of 16- to 19-year-olds in the U.S. worked some sort of job over the summer, according to Pew. By 2017, that figure dropped to a third of teens. The retail space has seen some of the more dramatic declines among young people. In July 2000, more than 2 million teens had retail jobs. In July 2017, just over 1.3 million teenagers did \u2015 marking a 35 percent decline.\n\nRetail is no longer as alluring as it once was. Wages began to stagnate in the early \u201980s and are no longer keeping in step with inflation, said Doug Stephens, founder of Retail Prophet, a group that advises retail brands. Because middle management jobs have been drastically reduced, it\u2019s much more difficult to get promoted in the retail space, he added.\n\n\u201cRetail \u2015 as a career \u2015 made sense for a young person to pursue,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cThat\u2019s no longer the case.\u201d\n\ng-stockstudio via Getty Images In July 2000, more than 2 million teens had retail jobs. In July 2017, just over 1.3 million teenagers did \u2015 marking a 35 percent decline.\n\nEmployment among teens changed dramatically in 1991 when, the economy recovered from a recession, but employment rates for this demographic didn\u2019t, as it had in years past, Pew noted in its report. A number of economic and sociological factors that affected teen employment had taken hold and remain in place today.\n\nFor one, there\u2019s more competition for low-skill, entry-level jobs. Baby boomers are retiring later and taking jobs in retail and service industries that were once reserved for teenagers. Teens are also competing with young, underemployed college graduates and immigrants, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAnd the jobs themselves have changed as well. Stores have cut back on sales jobs, and now hire more employees to help in the backroom, in warehouses and with logistics to keep up with the online ordering demand, said Andrew Challenger, vice president of Challenger Grey, a job placement firm.\n\n\u201cThere are still jobs,\u201d he noted. \u201cThey\u2019re just different jobs.\u201d\n\nTeenagers, in general, are also getting paid less, which is factoring into their decision-making. In 2014, the median hourly wage for teens was $8.43, down from $9.09 in 2002, according to BLS. So, even though college tuition costs have skyrocketed in recent years, teenagers have found that part-time work won\u2019t make that much of a dent in their mounting debt, according to the BLS. Many, instead, are opting to apply for financial aid, tax credits or deductions. More parents are borrowing to pay college tuition, too.\n\nYoung people are also motivated to volunteer for causes they care about in order to try and change the world around them.\n\nAfter her sophomore year of high school, Alanna Miller, now 18, spent her summer working at T.J. Maxx. But the Dallas-Fort Worth teen said her priorities shifted dramatically last winter when she was assigned to research the issue of universal background checks for firearms for her debate team. Miller has grown up in an era of mass shootings and has been undergoing routine lockdown drills since kindergarten.\n\nWhen Miller learned about the grassroots movement Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America as part of her debate research, she decided to join the group\u2019s youth chapter, Students Demand Action, as a local leader.\n\nWhen she was hired to work at a retail store called Beauty Brands last summer, she decided to delay her start date, so she could commit the entirety of June and July to volunteering for the organization. She said it was a sacrifice for her to give up the $10 an hour wages for that period of time, but she felt it was worth it.\n\n\u201cIt feels a little bit like a responsibility and also honor to do this work,\u201d Miller told HuffPost. \u201cI\u2019ve seen changes in my community and there\u2019s hope in that.\u201d\n\nDuring the school year, Miller balances her volunteer work with her sales job and academics.\n\nMiller said volunteering has become a trend among her peers. So much so, that it\u2019s considered an extracurricular just as much as, say, football and other more traditional high school activities.\n\nGrowth in volunteering among U.S. teens coincided with the decline in summer employment. The percentage of teenagers who volunteer more than doubled between 1989 and 2005, from 13 percent to 28 percent, according to the Corporation for National and Community Service. The organization released a new report in October, which found that 28 percent of teens between the ages of 16 and 19 volunteered last year, a figure that\u2019s remained pretty steady since the organization started tracking rates in 2002.\n\nThis demographic is involved in a range of volunteer efforts; 43 percent fundraise or sell items to raise money for causes, and 33 percent mentor youth.\n\n\u201cThis generation does more philanthropic work. They\u2019re spending summers building houses in hurricane-stricken areas,\u201d said Challenger. \u201cIt really helps on their college applications in a way that scooping ice cream at Dairy Queen doesn\u2019t necessarily do.\u201d\n\nIn addition to making a difference in their communities, young people also feel pressure to pursue opportunities that will spruce up their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for college and beyond.\n\nMel Spiegel, 22, a recent graduate of Colgate University, spent every summer in college doing a combination of interning and volunteering. While on break each year, Spiegel had at least three internships and also budgeted time for volunteering with New York Cares, a nonprofit that facilitates both long- and short-term volunteer projects for New Yorkers. Before heading off to an internship, Spiegel would often prepare and serve breakfast at a soup kitchen in New York City.\n\n\u201cYoung people are more motivated now to give back than ever,\u201d Spiegel said. \u201cOur generation feels like we need to take action to change the status quo in our communities.\u201d\n\nKir Siththi Thxng Chit / EyeEm via Getty Images Growth in volunteering among U.S. teens coincided with the decline in youth summer employment. The percentage of teenagers who volunteer more than doubled between 1989 and 2005, from 13 percent to 28 percent, according to the Corporation for National and Community Service.\n\nChanges in school schedules and academic rigor also interfere with teenagers\u2019 ability to work. The school year for many students starts before Labor Day, making it difficult for teens to commit to summer jobs. More young people take Advanced Placement courses and other classes to prepare for college.\n\nStill, taking an unpaid internship over an hourly-wage gig remains a privilege for teens who can afford to forgo the steady extra income. For teenagers who do work over the summer, it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be spending their days folding T-shirts or peddling jeans. They\u2019re also not getting as many jobs in manufacturing or construction, which has declined among this demographic since 2000. There\u2019s been a \u201cmodest\u201d uptick in the number of teens who get jobs in the arts, entertainment and recreation. In 2017, 8.7 percent of teens worked in that industry, compared with 7.5 percent in 2000, according to Pew.\n\nBut the employment rate among teens isn\u2019t going to increase anytime soon, experts say. By 2024, there should be an even lower teen participation rate in the workforce, according to BLS.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge drop,\u201d said Challenger of the decline in youth employment rates. \u201cIt\u2019s not that teenagers are lazy. They\u2019re making a rational choice that the world around them has changed.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Elyse Wanshel", "title": "Meghan McCain Writes Emotional Letter Of Grief 3 Months After Her Father\u2019s Death", "description": "\u201cI don\u2019t know how you go from talking to someone seven times a day to never,\u201d she wrote. \"Stay with me.

To receive TomDispatch in your inbox three times a week, click here.\n\nBy Tom Engelhardt\n\nFace it: it\u2019s been an abusive time, to use a word he likes to wield. In his telling, of course, it\u2019s he or his people who are always the abused ones and they \u2015 the \u201cfake news media\u201d \u2015 are the abusers. But let\u2019s be honest. You\u2019ve been abused, too, and so have I. All of us have and by that same fake news media.\n\nIt isn\u2019t complicated, really. Thanks to them, to those cable news talking heads who never stop yammering about him, to the reporters who clamor over his every word or twitch, he\u2019s always there, 24/7. I know that it\u2019s still called covering the news, but it\u2019s a phrase that no longer faintly fits the situation. Yes, a near majority of Americans voted for him as president, but no one voted to make him a living (and living-room) icon, a never-ending presence not just in our world, but in all our private worlds, too.\n\nNever, not ever, has a single human being been so inescapable. You can\u2019t turn on the TV news, read a newspaper, listen to the radio, wander on social media, or do much of anything else without almost instantly bumping into or tripping over... him, attacking them, praising himself, telling you how wonderful or terrible he feels and how much he loves or loathes... well, whatever happens to be ever so briefly on his mind that very moment.\n\nAnd if that isn\u2019t really almost too obvious to write down, then what is? Still, just briefly, let\u2019s try to take in the obvious. Let me put it this way: never, not since Adam or certainly Nebuchadnezzar, not to speak of Eve or Cleopatra, has anyone in history been so unrelentingly focused upon or mercilessly covered \u2015 so, in a sense, fawned upon (and, of course, \u201cabused\u201d). In the past, I\u2019ve labeled what we\u2019re living through \u201cthe white Ford Bronco presidency\u201d because, for the last nearly three years, the media has covered him as if he were indeed O.J. Simpson in that car fleeing the police over his wife\u2019s murder, as if, that is, there were nothing else on Earth worth gluing our eyeballs to, and not as in O.J.\u2019s case for a relatively few hours, but for what already seems like an eternity.\n\nIn a way, this is the simplest piece I\u2019ve ever written, because whoever you are, wherever you live in this country (or possibly on the planet), whatever you think of him, positive or negative, you already know all of this. You\u2019ve already discussed it with your friends. You\u2019ve certainly wondered what would happen if the mainstream media suddenly stopped attending to Donald Trump \u2015 and oh yes, I hadn\u2019t mentioned his name until now, because why bother? You never had a doubt, did you?\n\nMy guess on the effect of such a withdrawal of coverage: he\u2019d shrivel up and die. Your guess may be different, but it doesn\u2019t matter because we\u2019re clearly never going to find out. Even the recent presidential decision to take away CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta\u2019s press pass \u2015 doctored video of his behavior and all \u2015 after a distinctly abusive press conference (\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what: CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them. You are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn\u2019t be working for CNN\u201d), was only the cause for yet another deluge of coverage. None of Acosta\u2019s media compatriots, not even at CNN, decided, for instance, to protest by refusing to cover another White House event until he got that pass back (though CNN is suing the Trump administration). None of them evidently even seriously considered closing the door, shutting the gate, turning their backs on you-know-who. That clearly is the twenty-first-century media version of thinking about the unthinkable.\n\nHonestly, who doesn\u2019t talk about all this in the face of a presidency that\u2019s in your face, all our faces, in a way that no other president, emperor, king, autocrat, dictator, movie star, celebrity, or [feel free to fill in whatever I haven\u2019t thought of here] has ever before been. His every phrase, tweet, complaint, bit of praise, parenthetical comment, angry snit, insult, or even policy decision is reported, discussed, gnawed on, considered, reconsidered, yakked about nonstop, hour after hour after endless hour, reshown in clip after repetitive clip. This is, in short, a unique historical experience of ours and ours alone. How could we not talk about it all the time?\n\nThe Media Critic-in-Chief\n\nOh wait! Oddly enough, in case you hadn\u2019t noticed, there\u2019s one place where it\u2019s barely talked about at all, where silence largely reigns, and to my mind that couldn\u2019t be stranger.\n\nHere\u2019s the only catch in the non-stop coverage of Donald J. Trump (2015 to 2018 and beyond): that same mainstream media that can\u2019t get enough of him, that eats up and gnaws on his every odd phrase, gesture, act, or passing thought, is essentially silent on only one thing: the coverage itself. The most obvious subject in the world \u2015 not him, but the thing that keeps him going, that keeps the whole ship of state more or less afloat at this point \u2015 the unprecedented focus on him just doesn\u2019t seem to be a subject fit for significant coverage, even though it\u2019s a commonplace in our conversations out here in what still passes for the real world. We may regularly roll our eyes, but the mainstream media programmatically never does. Not in public anyway. And as was true from the beginning of the Trump era, from The New York Times and Politico to the Atlantic magazine, media outfits have hired yet more people to cover... well, Donald Trump (and not just from Washington either) and ploughed right on.\n\nBut do they cover themselves? Hardly. Media critics inside those mainstream companies have become an ever rarer species. The New York Times, for instance, let go of its \u201cpublic editor\u201d in May 2017 and left it to perhaps random tweeters to handle how the paper was covering anything. And that\u2019s been typical. Or put another way: there\u2019s really only one media critic left in the mainstream world \u2015 and you know just who he is! (A typical tweeted comment of his: \u201cA very big part of the Anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News. It has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description. Mainstream Media must clean up its act, FAST!\u201d) And sometimes that criticism couldn\u2019t be more personal. (\u201cLoser,\u201d he recently called White House reporter April Ryan. \u201cWhat a stupid question that is,\u201d he said to CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip. \u201cWhat a stupid question. But I watch you a lot, you ask a lot of stupid questions.\u201d) I\u2019m referring, of course, to America\u2019s media-critic-in-chief now in residence in Washington, D.C., when, of course, he isn\u2019t out in the provinces getting a little love from his adoring \u201cbase\u201d in those endless rallies for the midterm elections and, of course, the ones for the 2020 campaign, which began long ago.\n\nAnd naturally enough, the \u201cfake news\u201d reporters can\u2019t cover those rallies enough or discuss them and what he says at them more often. But again, there\u2019s one catch, one lacuna, in all this. They almost never cover Donald J. Trump\u2019s rally of rallies in that same analytical and dissecting fashion. I\u2019m thinking, of course, of the rallies that truly keep him going \u2015 and by that I mean his endless set of interactions with... yep, the media. After all, without being eternally in their glowing spotlight, without that endless coverage of everything him, what would he be?\n\nIn a sense, those hordes of reporters crowding into his world are his most adoring fans (even if many of them may loathe him personally). They may not literally bathe him in love (as his fans in those stadiums do), but they certainly bathe him in what he loves most, what clearly keeps him up and running: attention. And from each of those media \u201crallies\u201d of his, however small, however impromptu, however angry or insulting, no matter the nature of the words exchanged, he clearly comes away feeling clean as a new-born babe (though they perhaps feel dirty as... well, who knows what).\n\nIt may not be a love affair, but it certainly is an affair to remember. And despite the fact that his official news conferences may be rare, he manages to meet the press (to use a thoroughly outmoded phrase) constantly and in ways too numerous to mention. I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t be surprised to learn that he\u2019s taken more questions from reporters \u2015 even if he\u2019s regularly mangled and shredded them \u2015 than all our recent presidents (except that other classic narcissist, Bill Clinton).\n\nThe Donald\u2019s Earned Media World\n\nBeing the canny self-promoter that he is, Donald Trump knows the value of those exchanges, no matter their nature. He knows that the specifics of what the media may write or say about him matter remarkably little, as long as they cover him in this totalistic fashion, as long as they never stop bathing him in his own ultimate form of glory. They are, as he would be the first to tell you, his \u201cearned media.\u201d In fact, just the other day at his post-election news conference, he had this little exchange with a reporter:\n\n\u201cQ: Mr. President, first off, I personally think it\u2019s very good to have you here because a free press and this type of engagement \u2015\n\n\u201cThe President: I do, too. Actually? I do, too.\n\n\u201cQ: Yes. It\u2019s vital to democracy.\n\n\u201cThe President: It\u2019s called \u2018earned media.\u2019 It\u2019s worth billions. Go ahead.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: Donald Trump is no fool. He knows that he\u2019s got not just a knack but the knack for accruing \u201cearned media\u201d \u2015 that is, unpaid for publicity and advertising. Estimates were that he got a staggering $5.6 billion of it during his 2015-2016 election campaign and, exactly as he implied in that knowing aside, it\u2019s never ended. And yes, it is \u201cvital\u201d to him, if not to \u201cdemocracy.\u201d Think of him, in fact, as President Earned Media.\n\nSince we are talking about a mutual affair, however, the opposite is also true: Donald Trump is the media\u2019s version of... at the risk of being completely repetitious, earned media. No one\u2019s put it better than former CBS head Leslie Moonves \u2015 recently taken down by the #MeToo moment \u2015 during the 2016 election campaign. \u201cIt may not be good for America,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s damn good for CBS.\u201d He added, \u201cThe money\u2019s rolling in and this is fun. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this, and this [is] going to be a very good year for us. Sorry. It\u2019s a terrible thing to say. But bring it on, Donald. Keep going.\u201d And, as we all know, Donald did.\n\nKeep in mind that the media had been thrown into chaos and confusion by the growth of the online world of the Internet, as many news businesses faltered and staff cuts were widespread. How convenient, then, to stumble upon such genuine human clickbait, someone on whom you could focus your attention so relatively cheaply and profitably. So much for covering the world, a distinctly expensive proposition! Talk about bargain basement candidacies and presidencies!\n\nFrom the moment he descended that escalator in Trump Tower in June 2015, Donald Trump became the media equivalent of a freebie \u2015 someone viewers and readers just couldn\u2019t help watching, hearing about, reading about. It was like stumbling on a gold mine in the desert. As it turned out, Americans were indeed ready to have the talking heads of CNN (now the president\u2019s eternal punching bag), MSNBC, and Fox News yammer on hour after hour, day after day, about him and only him. It was, in its own way, a genuine miracle for news companies that had found themselves up against the wall and it couldn\u2019t have been more real, or \u2015 as, at some level, Donald Trump himself grasped \u2015 more fake.\n\nPut it all together and you can understand how a major Trump rally \u2015 oops, I mean that post-election news conference of his \u2015 actually worked. But first let me take a moment, in truly Trumpian fashion, to thank myself on your behalf. Like you, I watched clips of that news conference. Then I did all of you a favor and actually read the whole 17,000-plus words of it, one hour and 26 minutes worth of his and their words, so you wouldn\u2019t have to.\n\nAnd believe me, it was quite a performance as the president called on/ignored reporters desperate to get his attention, insulted them, spoke with them, spoke against them, spoke over them (\u201cWe are a hot country. This is a hot White House...\u201d), spoke around them, described them (\u201cI come in here as a nice person wanting to answer questions and I have people jumping out of their \u2015 their seats, screaming questions at me...\u201d), wandered away from them, wandered away from himself, ignored or didn\u2019t answer their questions, was incoherent for significant stretches of time, or couldn\u2019t even hold onto a thought. And by the way, the reporters there more than matched him (\u201cOne, I was tempted to ask you why you like Oprah so much, but I think I\u2019ll go on to the question that...\u201d), blow for blowhard (\u201cBased off of that, how would you say, over the last two years, God plays \u2015 what kind of a factor He plays in the day-to-day execution of the Office of the Presidency?\u2026\u201d).\n\nRead the whole thing and you\u2019d have to be struck \u2015 even by the less-than-soaring standards of past presidential news conferences \u2015 by how little (with a bow to Gertrude Stein) there there actually was there. The president\u2019s incoherence was remarkably well matched by the dreariness of the generally expectable, largely thought-free questions he was asked on a limited set of topics.\n\nAs always, though, there were those Trumpian moments that aren\u2019t likely to leave your head soon thereafter. There was, for instance, the exchange in which the president called on PBS\u2019s Yamiche Alcindor, a relatively rare black reporter in that room. She began her question this way, \u201cOn the campaign trail, you called yourself a nationalist. Some people saw that as emboldening white nationalists. Now people are also saying...\u201d\n\nAt that point, the president promptly interrupted to respond: \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019d say that. That\u2019s such a racist question.\u201d (Something he\u2019d then repeat twice more.) The pure chutzpah of that response should have taken anyone\u2019s breath away, but it was also a reminder of the strange sense of freedom Trump feels to say anything in the presence of the media, including mocking or insulting three black female reporters at that news conference.\n\nAnd this can only happen again and again and again. It\u2019s hard not to feel that we are all now eternally watching two sets of addicts who simply can\u2019t exist without or get enough of each other.\n\nToward the end of that news conference, one of the reporters began a question (also focused on white nationalism) this way: \u201cThank you, sir. And I think we\u2019d all love to have more of these, if you\u2019re willing...\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "RYOT Studio", "title": "Why It\u2019s Important To Keep Our Educational Borders Open", "description": "Closing off our educational borders will make our world smaller and less compassionate.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-its-important-to-keep-our-educational-borders-open_us_5bd1f2b6e4b0d38b58813fb1", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf2dd70240000300499b9bf.jpeg?ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T16:05:54Z", "content": "By Jen E.

Clarke, executive director, One To World\n\nCorporate conversations around improving diversity and inclusion have become more critical in recent years, fueled by the charged political atmosphere of the Me Too movement, athletes taking a knee, border barriers and more. Less prominent, but critically important still, is the threat to a boundary that\u2019s not as visible: the \u201copen borders\u201d in education that have historically allowed for some of the brightest minds to enrich our campuses.\n\nI know this because the organization I lead, One To World, has served international students, Fulbright scholars and international educators for the past four decades at more than 65 colleges and universities in the New York metropolitan area. Every day, we spearhead programs that bring unofficial global ambassadors into American schools, homes and workplaces.\n\nWhat the U.S. has to offer is unique \u2014 not just world-class academic programs, but also the freedom inherent in the experience of studying at our nation\u2019s campuses. However, with the recent twists and turns in immigration and foreign policy, there\u2019s a real concern that the U.S., while aiming to be \u201cgreat again,\u201d is becoming less competitive in the international higher education market, in which it previously had the pole position.\n\nIt is this concern that led me to join the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion as a signatory, to add our organization\u2019s unique mission of fostering intercultural exchange to the broader campaign of workplace acceptance. Addressing global differences at schools and campuses can set the foundation for employees and executives to be more culturally sensitive and open.\n\nHigh-quality higher education and the dynamism of the New York City region have made the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut the biggest magnet for international students, with New York alone drawing over 100,000 annually to its renowned institutions.\n\nBut in 2016, for the first time in over a decade, international student enrollment in the U.S. began declining. Between the fall of 2017 and 2018, new enrollments of international students were down by 5.5 percent at the graduate level across the nation, according to the 2018 \u201cOpen Doors Report on International Education Exchange\u201d issued by the Institute of International Education. At the undergraduate level, new enrollments were down 6.3 percent across the U.S. during that same period. We are concerned that this decline will only continue.\n\nCurrently, thousands of international scholars in the New York City area are pursuing degrees in science, math and other STEM-related fields of studies, even as fewer Americans are selecting these career paths. These STEM paths give birth to innovation, new discoveries and advances that will transform economies. In fact, some of the best-known start-ups were founded by international students: SpaceX, Eventbrite, WeWork and Stripe, to name just a few.\n\nIncluded in the ranks of international scholars are the elite Fulbright grantees from around the world. Each year, the New York area draws over 800 of these international talents, who have overcome rigorous, highly competitive stakes to be chosen to represent their countries at our institutions. They join their American classmates in pursuing traditional, as well as leading-edge degrees, ranging from business and law, to integrated digital media and robotic software engineering.\n\nFollowing their studies, many Fulbrighters will return to their hometowns to take up leading roles in government or the private sector. One To World is designated by the Department of State as the official coordinator of Fulbright programs in the New York area, and I can tell you that the Fulbright scholars arrive full of enthusiasm to embrace their academic goals, and also to build bridges between their home countries and the American communities beyond their campuses.\n\nWe set up informal dinners inside homes for them; bring them into New York\u2019s leading boardrooms, to our elite military institutions, like West Point; and into public school classrooms. They and other international students are unofficial ambassadors to American K-12 students, peers, professionals and families. And vice versa.\n\nThis was the intent of Senator J. William Fulbright when he founded the educational exchange program after World War II. He believed that creating a tipping point of people who had actually visited each other\u2019s countries and experienced one another\u2019s cultures would prevent future conflicts.\n\nOne To World has witnessed the benefits of these cultural exchanges directly. We know international students increase global fluency on our campuses, are a potential source of top talent for global and American firms and contribute to the economic health of local businesses and the cities in which they reside.\n\nWithout having more welcoming policies toward international visitors, including students, we risk losing this important resource and \u201csoft power\u201d abroad. Other countries are dangling more attractive visa regulations, offering after-graduation work options and financial assistance. Meanwhile, the U.S. is implementing travel bans and stricter visa requirements with longer processing times, making it harder for students to come with ease.\n\nFor all of these reasons, we\u2019re concerned to see classroom seats being filled by fewer and fewer international students. Closing off the educational borders will only serve to cut us off from becoming more culturally competent, make our world a little less compassionate and rob us of diverse knowledge and connections.\n\nLast week, I joined our academic partners in celebrating International Education Week, which included the inaugural International Education Day at the United Nations. It\u2019s a welcome annual spotlight, and in these uncertain times, especially meaningful to us, as it gave us an opportunity to advocate for open educational borders before a global audience.\n\nDiversity and inclusion has often been thought about in the context of the American experience. But with technology shrinking the world into one global village, we believe that real inclusion must embrace cultures from all over."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Nick Wing", "title": "Do You Use Drugs?

Researchers hope to gather tens of thousands of responses from drug users in the U.S., which they\u2019ll use to promote safer habits and inform future debates around drug policy.\n\nThe surveys are conducted anonymously. Go here for more information on how respondents\u2019 data is used.\n\nThe Global Drug Survey is an independent research company that, since 2012, has partnered with medical experts and media groups to distribute and analyze a yearly questionnaire. Previous editions have compiled more than half a million responses from respondents in dozens of countries.\n\nThe resulting data has provided valuable insights into drug use habits. The 2017 survey showed that hallucinogenic mushrooms and LSD were among the safest recreational drugs. In 2018, it revealed that a relatively large percentage of marijuana users around the world report signs of dependence.\n\nThis year\u2019s survey touches on a number of topics that are particularly relevant to Americans, said Adam Winstock, the British psychiatrist and addiction researcher who created the Global Drug Survey.\n\nThe survey includes questions about legal marijuana markets, with a particular focus on the growing popularity of cannabis edibles, which are more popular in the U.S. than anywhere, said Winstock. It will also look at consumer responses to warning labels on recreational weed products. With 10 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., now having legalized marijuana, it\u2019s important for officials to have solid data to work with when crafting rules and regulations associated with commercial sales, said Winstock.\n\nThe 2019 Global Drug Survey also asks a number of questions about sexual assault and drug use. Winstock said it was a natural topic to explore amid the Me Too movement, which has led to numerous claims against men who have allegedly sexually mistreated women. Through the survey, Winstock said he hopes to get a clearer idea of the role drugs and alcohol play in these sorts of incidents, as well as how they affect a victim\u2019s response to them.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the whole issue of people not reporting because of fears that they were an unreliable witness or that police wouldn\u2019t take them seriously,\u201d said Winstock.\n\nThis year\u2019s survey will also delve into the emerging field of psychedelic therapy, in which psychedelic drugs are used to assist with psychotherapy for the treatment of mental illness. Clinical trials are currently underway to probe the use of MDMA (commonly known as Ecstasy), psilocybin (magic mushrooms), and LSD in treating a variety of conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety related to terminal illness, substance addiction and depression.\n\nAlthough early studies have suggested that these psychedelic drugs could have promising therapeutic applications, Winstock said he wants to know how receptive the general public would be to such an alternative treatment method.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all well and good running a small clinical trial with a bunch of people who\u2019ve got a defined mental illness, but how the wider population would feel about going into a clinic and snorting ketamine as part of their treatment, or going in and having an intense psychedelic experience to deal with their mental health, I just don\u2019t know,\u201d said Winstock."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Ron Dicker", "title": "John Krasinski Zings Hugh Jackman For Getting Cozy With Emily Blunt", "description": "Then Ryan Reynolds joined in the roasting -- naturally.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-krasinski-hugh-jackman-emily-blunt_us_5bf2bf81e4b0757388209574", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf2c5291f000006062637ce.png?ops=1200_630", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T15:09:04Z", "content": "This could be the start of a wonderful feudship.

(AP) \u2014 With their grip on power set to loosen come January, Republicans in several states are considering last-ditch laws that would weaken existing or incoming Democratic governors and advance their own conservative agendas.\n\nIn Michigan, where the GOP has held the levers of power for nearly eight years, Republican legislators want to water down a minimum wage law they approved before the election so that it would not go to voters and would now be easier to amend.\n\nRepublicans in neighboring Wisconsin are discussing ways to dilute Democrat Tony Evers\u2019 power before he takes over for GOP Gov. Scott Walker. And in North Carolina, Republicans may try to hash out the requirements of a new voter ID constitutional amendment before they lose their legislative supermajorities and their ability to unilaterally override vetoes by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper.\n\nRepublicans downplay the tactics and point out that Democrats have also run lame-duck sessions, including in Wisconsin in 2010 before Walker took office and the GOP took control of the Legislature. But some of the steps Republicans are expected to take will almost surely be challenged in court, and critics say such maneuvers undermine the political system and the will of the people, who voted for change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that smacks every Michigan voter in the face and tells them that this Republican Party doesn\u2019t care about their voice, their perspective,\u201d House Democratic Leader Sam Singh said of the strategizing to control the fate of minimum wage increases and paid sick leave requirements.\n\nThe moves would follow midterm elections in which Democrats swept statewide offices in Michigan and Wisconsin for the first time in decades but fell short of taking over their gerrymandered legislatures. That gives Republicans a final shot to lock in new policies, with Democrats unable to undo them anytime soon.\n\nMichigan\u2019s new minimum wage and sick time laws began as ballot drives but because they were preemptively adopted by lawmakers in September rather than by voters, they can be altered with simple majority votes rather than the support of three-fourths of both chambers.\n\nOne measure would gradually raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour and increase a lower wage for tipped workers until it is in line with the minimum. The other would require that employees qualify for between 40 and 72 hours of paid sick leave, depending on the size of their employer.\n\nIt is unclear how the laws may be changed to appease an anxious business lobby. The Michigan Chamber of Commerce says mandatory sick time \u2014 10 other states also require it \u2014 will place \u201csevere compliance burdens\u201d on employers, including those with paid leave policies in place currently. The group also is urging lawmakers to \u201cbe pragmatic, not extreme\u201d and revisit the wage hikes that would make Michigan\u2019s minimum the highest in the Midwest.\n\nRepublicans seem unfazed by criticism that scaling back the measures would thwart the will of voters who resoundingly elected Democrat Gretchen Whitmer to replace GOP Gov. Rick Snyder, who reached his term limit. The Michigan Senate\u2019s majority leader, Arlan Meekhof, said changes to the laws are needed to \u201ccontinue to keep our economy on track and not put a roadblock or hindrance\u201d in the way of businesses.\n\nLame-duck sessions, which are commonplace in Congress but rare among many state legislatures, are frenetic, as legislators rush to consider bills that are controversial or were put on the backburner during election season. Michigan\u2019s 2012 session, for example, produced right-to-work laws and a contentious revised emergency manager statute for cities in financial peril, despite voters having just repealed the previous law.\n\nThe lame-duck period may be especially intense this year in Michigan and Wisconsin because they are among just four states in which Republicans are losing full control the governorship and both legislative chambers. Lawmakers in the other two states, Kansas and New Hampshire, will not convene until next year.\n\nSix states with a split government now will be fully controlled by Democrats in 2019, and Alaska will be fully controlled by Republicans.\n\nWisconsin Republicans plan to consider a variety of ways to protect laws enacted by Walker. Those include limiting Evers\u2019 ability to make appointments, restricting his authority over the rule-making process and making it more difficult for him to block a work requirement for Medicaid recipients. They might also change the date of the 2020 presidential primary so that a Walker-appointed state Supreme Court justice has better odds to win election.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Nov. 7, 2018, file photo, Wisconsin Democratic Gov.-elect Tony Evers walks into a room before speaking with reporters in Madison, Wis. (Steve Apps/Wisconsin State Journal via AP, File)\n\nIn North Carolina, GOP legislators may use the session for more than approving additional bipartisan Hurricane Florence relief. They are expected to implement a voter photo ID requirement passed this month by the electorate and to consider other legislation that the Democratic governor would be powerless to stop until Republicans can no longer easily override his vetoes come 2019.\n\nTwo years ago, they reduced Cooper\u2019s powers before he took office.

It certainly seems so, despite a lot of smoke and bluff from her detractors.\n\nFor starters, it is dawning on the newly elected House Democrats, most of whom are progressives, that the hardcore anti-Pelosi opposition is comprised of men who want to push the party to the center.\n\nThe hashtag #FiveWhiteGuys nicely sums up what\u2019s at work. The white guys in question are Reps. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, Tim Ryan of Ohio, Ed Perlmutter of Colorado, Kurt Schrader of Oregon and Bill Foster of Illinois. They want a party that has more appeal to the middle.\n\nBut the 2018 election was all about grassroots energy, women\u2019s leadership and Democrats running as pocketbook progressives flipping House seats. So, why would the Democratic caucus want to displace a leader who is effective and progressive, as well as female?\n\nAnyone who closely follows House politics knows that Pelosi is the most skilled Democratic leader since Tip O\u2019Neill, maybe even better. That\u2019s why the Republicans keep demonizing her.\n\nPelosi was brilliant holding the caucus together under President Barack Obama to get the Affordable Care Act passed, and even more brilliant in opposition, making sure the Republican Congress didn\u2019t kill it. She was superb at organizing the caucus last year so that not a single Democrat broke ranks and voted for the Trump tax bill, as dozens had voted for Bush and Reagan tax cuts.\n\nPelosi was also masterful at keeping Democratic House candidates focused on bread-and-butter issues such as health care, prescription drug costs, Social Security, jobs and wages, and making sure that Democrats did not fall into the Trump trap of leading with identity politics.\n\nThanks to this strategy, not only did at least 37 Democrats flip Republican House seats \u2015 many of them in improbable places \u2015 but several African Americans took Republican seats in majority white districts by staying focused on pocketbook issues. When the history of Trump\u2019s downfall is written, one of the most dramatic and ennobling aspects of November 2018 as a turning point will be the fact that several Trump districts voted for black progressives for Congress.\n\nThe anti-Pelosi movement is a mashup of opportunism on the part of a few wannabe leaders, such as Moulton and Ryan, combined with a dose of ageism, sexism and defensive tactical moves by a few Democrats who won in conservative districts. There are 10 incoming freshmen who felt they had to take the Republicans\u2019 Pelosi attacks off the table during their campaigns by pledging not to support her.\n\nBut this past week, Pelosi demonstrated just how astute a politician she is. She understands the desire for a generational shift and for younger members to assume more leadership positions.\n\nPolitico reported Friday that Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state, who is expected to co-chair the House Progressive Caucus next year, met with Pelosi and won a commitment that caucus members would have more seats on major committees. Jayapal, previously uncommitted, gave Pelosi a full endorsement. She described the centrist effort to displace Pelosi as \u201cthe opposite of what the election really told us.\u201d\n\nThe end game of this farce will come in two parts. The first will come on Nov. 28, when Democrats elect their new leader. Pelosi will likely win this vote overwhelmingly.\n\nThen on Jan. 3 comes the vote for speaker. The 10 newly elected House Democrats, in theory, could be joined by the swath of centrist incumbents who have previously said they will not support Pelosi. That adds up to more than 20 Democrats who have said they will not support Pelosi.\n\nIf you work out that arithmetic statically, and assume that Democrats eventually have 233 or 234 seats, the defection of all those declared against her would leave Pelosi short of the 218 she presumably needs to be elected speaker. But that\u2019s not how this is likely to play out.\n\nBill Clark via Getty Images Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, arrives for the House Democrats' caucus meeting in the Capitol on Thursday, Nov. 15, 2018.\n\nAfter Pelosi is overwhelmingly elected as Democratic leader, the pressure will be immense on wavering members not to allow a Republican to be elected speaker. And even if several vote against Pelosi, or vote present, she can be elected speaker with fewer than 218 votes.\n\nThis has happened before. In 2015, John Boehner was elected speaker with 216 votes. So was Newt Gingrich in 1997.\n\nLet\u2019s say that Democrats end up with 234 seats and Republicans with 201. It\u2019s inconceivable that anti-Pelosi Democrats would vote to make Republican leader Kevin McCarthy the speaker. The greater likelihood is that Democrats opposed to Pelosi will vote present. Assume that 20 Democrats vote present and all Republicans vote for McCarthy. Pelosi still wins 214 votes, to McCarthy\u2019s 201, and becomes the next speaker.\n\nThe anti-Pelosi forces hope that a bandwagon effect creates a groundswell of support for some other candidate and Pelosi will step aside before the vote. Their problem is that the bandwagon is going in the opposite direction, as Pelosi solidifies her support.\n\nThe other problem is that there isn\u2019t anyone else with Pelosi\u2019s stature, skill, or popularity in the caucus. The only member who has announced a possible run for the job is Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio\u2019s 11th District. Fudge is African American, as well as a member of the House Progressive Caucus.\n\nIf she does run for leader, Fudge would split the Black Caucus and the Progressive Caucus, though Pelosi would have the overwhelming support of most members of both. It is a testament to the sheer cynicism of Moulton, a leading member of the centrist New Democrat Coalition and critic of the party left, that he is promoting Fudge, a flat-out progressive, as an anti-Pelosi stalking horse.\n\nCongress needs a new leader. Period.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m hoping Marcia Fudge, my first (and arguably best) mentor in Congress will run for the next Speaker of the House. I have full faith in her ability to lead our new Congress to its fullest potential. \u2014 Seth Moulton (@sethmoulton) November 15, 2018\n\nDemocrats are famous for snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.

I notice the way the dress clings just a little too much over my hips. At 45, there is no denying that I have my mom\u2019s body, but on this particular day it is OK. Over the last few months, I have finally realized just how lucky I am to have her body \u2015 a body that matches my gender identity \u2015 because over the last year, my daughter Ava has revealed to me that she knows she was born in the wrong one.\n\nI remember, years ago, watching my mother in similar dressing rooms as she tried on skirt after skirt in search of one cut in a way to flatter her body rather than draw attention to her \u201cproblem\u201d areas. I won\u2019t let myself gain that extra 20 pounds, I thought back then. I\u2019ll keep my weight in check so the pear shape I inherited from her won\u2019t be accentuated, I promised myself. I spent a good 30 years trying to keep my genetic predisposition under control, starting at the age of 12. It was three full decades of criticizing my reflection in every mirror and store window I passed and waging a war with everything I ate, or even thought about eating, before I eventually embraced an exercise routine. And though I\u2019ve been able to successfully fight off that extra 20 pounds, there has been no denying the changes my body has undergone in the last five years since turning 40.\n\nOn this particular day, as I study \u2015 rather than scrutinize \u2015 my body in the dressing room mirror, I wonder what my daughter has thought as she\u2019s watched me get dressed. I picture my teenage self observing my mom moisturize her entire body after her shower, her hands moving up her leg to her thighs and over her hips, and I think about how many times my kids have walked into my bathroom while I am doing the same thing. I wonder about the differences between how I would see my mom versus how my daughter sees me. I would look at my mother\u2019s body and think of all things that were \u201cwrong\u201d with it, while my daughter looks at my body and sees the body we define as female \u2015 a body she wants for herself.\n\nI wonder if she asks herself, Will I ever get to have my mother\u2019s body? I don\u2019t know, but Ava has been asking me a lot of other questions lately. Her questions are each a literal inquiry about some aspect of her developing womanhood, but beneath each question\u2019s surface, there is also much unsaid about the unique journey she is on and everything that has and will come with it.\n\nI would look at my mother\u2019s body and think of all things that were 'wrong' with it, while my daughter looks at my body and sees the body we define as female \u2015 a body she wants for herself.\n\n\u201cHow long do you think I\u2019d have to be taking estrogen before I start developing some breast tissue?\u201d she\u2019s asked me. I\u2019ve spent years making jokes about how awful my sagging breasts look \u2015 breasts that sag because they\u2019ve had the privilege of nursing three kids. I\u2019ve complained about all of the times they have been squished into mammograms and eventually MRI\u2019d to keep close watch on some suspicious areas. I\u2019ve lamented all of the clothes I can\u2019t wear because I always have to wear a bra, while she awaits the development of her breasts as some kind of proof or validation of the woman she is.\n\n\u201cYou know how most girls have thighs that are wider and curve at the top? Is there any exercise that can help mine become like that?\u201d she\u2019s asked. I explained to her that I think exercise will build up her muscles, but she should do whatever exercise she wants if she enjoys it and not worry about that. I think about all the times I\u2019ve noticed my thighs splay out when I sit on a couch, or the times I\u2019ve cropped them out of a photo. While I\u2019ve always hated my wide \u201cchild-bearing\u201d hips \u2015 the same ones that my mom and all five of her sisters have \u2015 she is eager for hormones to redistribute some fat to the same area of her body. Why have I always thought that my thighs and hips betray me \u2015 even though they are, in fact, exactly as they should be \u2015 when my daughter\u2019s entire body betrays her?\n\n\u201cYour skin is so soft, Mom. Will the estrogen make mine softer?\u201d she\u2019s wondered aloud. Why have I wasted so many years fighting being soft, when I too remember snuggling against my mom and thinking that she feels better than any pillow in the world.\n\nWith each new question my daughter has for me, and really, for the world around her, I realize I\u2019m not sure I have any answers to give her in return \u2015 at least not any good ones. And every question brings me back to the same old ones: How do I convey to Ava just how beautiful and perfect her body is and will be, even if it never looks exactly like the ones the media and our society tell her a woman should have? She could choose to not take hormones and never consider surgery, and it would not make her any less of a woman. How do I make her believe that her worth as a woman is not directly tied to her body if I\u2019ve spent the last 30 years acting like mine is?\n\nHow do I make my daughter believe that her worth as a woman is not directly tied to her body if I\u2019ve spent the last 30 years acting like mine is?\n\nAnd then, just when I\u2019ve convinced myself that all of these questions may very well mean she will never accept herself for the woman that she is, about six months ago, Ava said something that made me realize that she understands it all much better than I do.\n\nWe were in a waiting room, taking steps to try to preserve her chance for future biological children by investigating freezing her sperm before she began hormone therapy. I had just finished telling her that I needed her to know that, although she was undergoing this process, there was no guarantee about the viability of her sperm 20 years from now. Hearing this, she turned to me and said, \u201cMom, don\u2019t worry. I know that. But I also know that I am going to be a mom one day. Whether it\u2019s this way or another, I will be a mom.\u201d She used the word \u201cmom\u201d \u2015 not \u201cparent\u201d \u2015 but mom.\n\nI took a second to take in what she had just told me and the quiet wisdom embedded in her words. Despite all of the questions and despite all of the worrying and despite all of the uncertainty that Ava is facing, she still has faith in herself, in me and in the world around her. Of course, she has challenges ahead of her \u2015 arguably more challenges than other young women her age \u2015 but in that moment, her confident and courageous perspective felt like a gift, and with that gift, I felt like I also received a certain kind of peace I hadn\u2019t known up until that moment.\n\nI used to talk to my mom about how I couldn\u2019t wait to be a mother one day. And though I\u2019m not in any rush to be a grandmother, I look forward to seeing my daughter be an amazing mom. I know that whether or not she has my \u201cmom body,\u201d she will be a much more incredible mother and role model than I can ever dream of being. If as a teenager she understands that the validity and strength of one\u2019s mothering has nothing to do with having biological children or not, then deep down she knows that being a woman and its definition is in your mind and not defined by your body. If she is more sure of who she is at 14 than I have been of who I am my entire life, then I really have nothing to worry about.\n\nI start to realize that Ava and the future generation of determined courageous young women will redefine everything we know about gender norms and gender roles and women\u2019s bodies and the expectations people have of them. I replace worry with gratitude for having a child that is teaching me more than I can ever teach her. And because of all that, I now know that, at 45, I am finally done fighting my mom\u2019s body \u2015 and my own \u2015 and I\u2019m ready to embrace myself exactly as the woman I am.\n\nParia Hassouri is a mother of three and a pediatrician in Los Angeles.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will host a livestreamed town hall summit on climate change next month, a move that may intensify pressure on the next Congress to curb planet-warming emissions and challenge TV networks to cover a rapidly worsening crisis they\u2019ve long ignored.\n\nThe 90-minute event \u2015 scheduled from 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Dec. 3 \u2015 will be held at the Capitol Visitor Center Auditorium in Washington and broadcast over Facebook, YouTube and Twitter by seven progressive media outlets.\n\n\u201cWe need millions of people all over this country to stand up and demand fundamental changes in our energy policy in order to protect our kids and our grandchildren and the planet,\u201d Sanders told HuffPost by phone. \u201cThe good news is the American people are beginning to stand up and fight back.\u201d\n\nSpeakers include 350.org founder Bill McKibben, activist and \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d star Shailene Woodley, climate scientist Brenda Ekwurzel, activist and musician Xiuhtezcatl Martinez, and Mayor Dale Ross of deep-red Georgetown, Texas, whose avowedly pragmatic embrace of newly cheap renewable energy has made him a poster boy for how Republicans could quit climate change denialism.\n\nIt\u2019s the fifth live-broadcast town hall Sanders has hosted. Past programs examined the universal health care proposal Medicare for All, inequality, the Iran nuclear deal, and workers vs. chief executives.\n\nThe event bolsters Sanders, a likely contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, as the most serious candidate on climate change, offering a far more comprehensive response than rival progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who staked out a climate policy based on a bill to force public companies to disclose financial risk from warming or regulations to curb emissions.\n\nThe summit, which took months to plan, will take place less than a month after Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) propelled talk of a so-called Green New Deal into the Democratic mainstream, giving play for the first time to the sort of federal response to climate change scientists say is necessary to fully meet the scale of the crisis. In October, the United Nations concluded world governments must halve emissions over the next 12 years or risk catastrophic warming with $54 trillion in damage.\n\nThe historic wildfire that left 63 dead and 631 missing in Northern California this month, in what was once the Golden State\u2019s rainy season, offers a glimpse of that future, Sanders warned.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Search and rescue workers search for human remains at a trailer park burned by the Camp Fire in Northern California.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing is a growing consciousness,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThe horrors that we\u2019ve seen in California in the largest forest fire that that state has ever experienced \u2015 this is not going to be an anomaly unless we begin the long, hard struggle to transform our energy system.\u201d\n\nClimate remains a low priority for most voters. Just 38 percent of registered voters said candidates\u2019 positions on global warming would be \u201cvery important\u201d to their voting decisions, according to a Yale Program On Climate Change Communication survey published in May. Rising temperatures ranked 15th of 28 issues voters ranked in the questionnaire.\n\nBut among liberal Democrats in that poll, the issue ranked fourth, behind health care, gun policies and general environmental protections. A YouGov survey of 2018 voters found 75 percent of Democrats strongly supported charging companies with big carbon dioxide footprints a polluter fee, and 56 percent favored giving unemployed Americans federally backed jobs in energy efficiency and weatherization.\n\nIn the lead up to the 2018 midterm elections, the fossil fuel industry spent $100 million to crush pro-climate ballot measures across the West, and to prop up candidates who supported increased oil and gas extraction. Yet that base of climate hawks helped elect a cadre of Democrats whose urgent visions for climate action earned plaudits from a spectrum ranging from mainstream environmental groups to so-called eco-socialists. And a new majority of Democratic state attorneys general are facing growing pressure to file lawsuits over climate damages.\n\nActivists, freshly galvanized by the hellscape images of California\u2019s deadliest wildfire, seem primed for action, and the party\u2019s progressive wing has signaled a new willingness to force a more serious debate over an issue that\u2019s remained stagnant in the House for much of the past decade.\n\n\u201cThe fact that [climate change] is that high among the base of one of our two major political parties is remarkable, because that was not the case even five years ago,\u201d said Anthony Leiserowitz, a senior research scientist and Yale\u2019s climate program director. \u201cIf you think of Bernie, you\u2019d think he\u2019d be talking about inequality or civil rights. There\u2019s a whole host of progressive issues, yet this is the one he\u2019s leading with. It may suggest there\u2019s been an alignment of the stars.\u201d\n\nLast week, youth activists with the grassroots climate group Sunrise Movement staged sit-ins in the offices of House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), the likely next chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, who opposed the creation of a select committee on a Green New Deal.\n\nAt least three sitting members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus agreed to back a resolution Ocasio-Cortez proposed to establish a 15-member Green New Deal panel. Activists are hoping Sanders\u2019 event will add the 2016 presidential contender\u2019s star power to their movement.\n\nThe horrors that we\u2019ve seen in California in the largest forest fire that that state has ever experienced \u2015 this is not going to be an anomaly unless we begin the long hard struggle to transform our energy system. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)\n\n\u201cHe helped popularize things like Medicare for All, a living wage and a lot of other fights he\u2019s taken up,\u201d said Varshini Prakash, the co-founder of Sunrise Movement. \u201cI hope he pushes for a Green New Deal and helps really add fuel to the fire that\u2019s been lit under politicians and the public over the past week.\u201d\n\nSanders stopped short of endorsing the Green New Deal. But in April 2017, he co-sponsored legislation to move the United States to 100-percent clean energy by 2050. The bill included $7 billion in targeted infrastructure and environmental investments in fossil-fuel communities, and called for union labor protections for workers on federally backed green jobs. In November 2017, Sanders introduced a bill to spend $146 billion rebuilding storm-ravaged Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with renewable energy.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is extremely bold legislation,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIf there are Democrats who cannot support it, well, we\u2019ve got to push pressure on them.\u201d\n\nThe relative absence of climate science from TV broadcasts that dominate American political discourse makes it hard to raise awareness of the near-term threats warming poses.\n\nSeventy-one percent of major, televised debates in the 2018 midterm elections ignored the issue completely. Only four of the 107 segments ABC, CBS and NBC aired from Nov. 8 to Nov. 13 on the deadly wildfires scorching California this month discussed climate change. In 2017, the influential Sunday morning talk shows on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox News aired a combined 260 minutes of climate coverage, 79 percent of which focused exclusively on President Donald Trump\u2019s personal beliefs on science and his decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement.\n\n\u201cThis is an issue of huge consequence and you would think that ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox would be talking about this every day, having the debate, \u2018What do we do?

Email askdoyin@huffpost.com.\n\n\u2015\n\nHuffPost Illustration/Getty Images Your relatives might say you\u2019re overreacting or being too sensitive, but having a zero-tolerance policy for racism is neither.\n\nMy parents are hosting Thanksgiving dinner for about 20 people this year \u2015 including my uncle, who has extremely inflammatory political views. Last year at Christmas, he \u201cjoked\u201d with my husband that if President Trump built his border wall, my husband would be working on a Mexican farm instead of here in the U.S. as a sales executive. (My husband, who is Hispanic, is an American citizen. I am a liberal white woman.) Then, during the 4th of July, my uncle put MAGA hats on our 3-year-old twin boys without us knowing, took a quick photo, and posted it on his social media pages with the caption, \u201cThis is one way to keep kids out of cages.\u201d He later removed them at my angry request, and we haven\u2019t seen him since.\n\nMy mom (also a liberal) excuses her brother\u2019s behavior as him \u201cbeing silly,\u201d but it\u2019s anything but silly, and I\u2019m worried a physical altercation will occur if his antics continue. What do I do?\n\n\u2013 Liz in Dallas\n\nFirst of all, nobody should ever post photos of someone else\u2019s kids on social media without the parents\u2019 permission \u2015 that\u2019s straight out of the \u201cCommon Sense 101\u201d handbook.\n\nSecondly, your uncle\u2019s \u201cjokes\u201d about kids in cages and your husband working on a Mexican farm are racist AF.\n\nToday\u2019s political climate is completely different from that of a few years ago. This isn\u2019t just about Republicans vs. Democrats or conservatives vs. liberals anymore \u2015 it\u2019s about basic humanity.\n\nI\u2019m also a liberal, and I have a lot of friends with conservative views, but I\u2019m still friends with many of them. Why? Because they denounce racism, bigotry and misogyny at every turn. But I\u2019ve had to purge many others from my life who support hateful politicians simply because they promise to appoint a conservative Supreme Court justice, or because they vow to criminalize abortion, or because they\u2019re similarly low-key racist.\n\nYou can\u2019t say you care about marginalized groups and then cast votes that make their lives more difficult. It doesn\u2019t work that way.\n\nBy no means am I advocating violence, here, but your uncle\u2019s behavior is going to result in his ass getting kicked someday when he pulls that nonsense on the wrong person. And the last person you want delivering that ass-kicking is your husband. On Thanksgiving. At a family event.\n\nSince the gathering is at your mom\u2019s house, I\u2019d start by talking to her about your uncle\u2019s behavior and draw a very distinct line in the sand. No, don\u2019t tell her that she needs to make her home a \u201cpolitics-free zone\u201d \u2015 it\u2019s good to have people show their true colors. Instead, tell her the moment your uncle unleashes offensive garbage toward your family, you\u2019re going to grab your kids and leave.\n\nYour mom might say you\u2019re overreacting or being too sensitive, but I don\u2019t think having a zero-tolerance policy for racism qualifies as either. And if she\u2019s worth a damn as a grandmother, she will do whatever it takes to ensure her child \u2015 and her grandchildren \u2015 are as comfortable as possible.\n\nThat said, if she fails to get that message across to her brother, and if he does something offensive, you need to make a scene. Not a \u201csquare up and flip the furniture\u201d scene, mind you, but enough to call out his behavior and, yes, straight-up embarrass him in front of everyone in attendance.\n\nAnd it won\u2019t take much. Using the \u201cMexican farmer\u201d comment, for example, you could respond:\n\nWhy would you say something like that? My husband is an American citizen, just like you. I\u2019m not going to tolerate this behavior any longer; I\u2019d rather spend Thanksgiving with my family alone in a hotel than here with you.\n\nThen, grab your stuff and bounce. Don\u2019t let anyone try to change your mind. You gave your mom a warning, and she didn\u2019t make her point clear enough. Head out the door and don\u2019t look back.\n\nWhy make a scene? Because I\u2019m tired of the emphasis on civility. Because civility is what allows racists to say racist shit without being called out on it. Civility is saying, \u201cYeah, he posted photos of my kids on social media wearing MAGA hats without my permission while making an offensive joke about kids in cages \u2014 but he\u2019s my uncle, so I\u2019ll let it slide.\u201d\n\nNo. We need more people standing up to racism and bigotry than ever before. Because guess what? The racists aren\u2019t worried about offending us, so why are we worried about offending them?\n\nAt the end of the day, there are only two types of people in the world: those who bring things to the table and those who take things from the table. It sounds like your uncle is the kind of guy who doesn\u2019t add a ton of value to your family\u2019s well-being. If so, maybe it\u2019s not worth sharing a table with him at Thanksgiving \u2015 or any other holiday \u2015 if he doesn\u2019t change his ways.\n\n\u2015\n\nasiseeit via Getty Images Do you need your husband's permission to look for a job? No. Should you talk to him about it first? Maybe.\n\nI\u2019ve been a stay-at-home mom for five years, and I\u2019m itching to get back into the workforce. Without telling my husband, I submitted my resume for an accounting job, had a couple of interviews, and they offered me the position.\n\nWhen I told my husband, he was very upset and said I should decline the offer because my first responsibility should be to our two young children (5 years old and 3 years old). But both of them are in school for at least part of the day, so why can\u2019t I go back to work? Does it make me a bad mom to desire more for myself besides playdates and laundry?\n\n\u2013 Allie in Phoenix\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make you a bad mom for wanting more for yourself, Allie. But it doesn\u2019t make you the greatest wife in the world for going for it without letting your husband know.\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not saying you need your husband\u2019s permission to do this. You\u2019re a grown-ass woman who can do whatever she wants. But don\u2019t you think you should\u2019ve at least given him a heads-up about your unhappiness since he\u2019s your life partner?\n\nI get it. The \u201cit\u2019s easier to get forgiveness than permission\u201d route is well-traveled when the other party isn\u2019t keen on big changes. You knew he wouldn\u2019t be happy with this move before you made it, so you might want to think about why that\u2019s the case. Is he really concerned about the kids\u2019 well-being with you going back into the workforce, or is it something else? Does he feel like \u201cless of a man\u201d because the perception is out there that your family needs an additional income to survive?\n\nI\u2019m spitballing, here, but I would do my part to get to the bottom of this and help ease his concerns. Because if the kids are in school, why should you sit at home? If working makes you a happier person, it\u2019s going to make you a better mom and wife, as well, and then everybody wins.\n\nI think the biggest issue here isn\u2019t your new job. It\u2019s the fact that you don\u2019t feel comfortable communicating with your husband about important issues. Maybe you feel that he has 51 percent of the vote in your house because he brings home all of the income, but I\u2019m here to say that your contribution to the family is just as important \u2014 if not more so. I recommend telling your husband that taking this job is something that you\u2019re going to do (meaning, that you\u2019re not asking for his permission) and you want to sit down and review any concerns he has about this change.\n\nAlmost 50 percent of two-parent households in America have both parents working full time, so this is hardly groundbreaking stuff.

He hadn\u2019t applied for a position there, but the email sender told him he was the exact candidate Samsung wanted for its newest software technology position.\n\nOmar was set up for four interviews that took place over the next few weeks: one phone call and three in-person interviews set for Samsung\u2019s Strategy and Innovation Center in San Jose, California.\n\nThe interview process, in October 2017, was expedited, Samsung told Omar. He took that as a good sign. After all, the California resident had over 10 years\u2019 experience in the software technology field, and this was an unsolicited job offer. When the date of his in-person interviews arrived, Omar was scheduled for three one-hour meetings, starting with a Samsung software engineer, followed by an interview with the hiring manager and the last with a manager of software engineering.\n\nOmar said he breezed through the first two interviews. They were short, Omar told HuffPost. He said the discussions lacked any \u201ctechnical depth,\u201d which is unusual for a technology position. The hiring manager told Omar all he needed to do was to impress his last interviewer and that everyone else was convinced Omar was the perfect candidate and that he should secure the position.\n\nBut that last interview, Omar said, took a bizarre turn when his interviewer didn\u2019t ask him about his work experiences or technical capabilities. Instead, the interviewer emphasized the importance of company culture, Omar said, and how that included drinking a lot of alcohol, sometimes until 2 in the morning.\n\n\u201cI can tell you\u2019re a Muslim,\u201d the interviewer told Omar. He then pressed him to discuss his religious views and elaborate on his attitude on alcohol.\n\nHuffPost is withholding Omar\u2019s real name over concerns of a backlash from other potential employers. Omar is in the process of interviewing with various other companies for a new job.\n\nOmar said he told his interviewer that although he personally chooses not to drink alcohol, he would have no issue with co-workers doing so. But Omar said the interviewer was not satisfied with his response and questioned him further about his faith, asked how religious he was and how his decision to not drink alcohol might interfere with team \u201ccohesiveness.\u201d\n\nIt was only 25 minutes into the one-hour meeting when the interviewer suddenly walked out \u2015 indicating to Omar that the meeting was over. Three days later, Omar found out he did not get the position at Samsung. He said he immediately realized why.\n\n\u201cIt all kind of clicked,\u201d he said.\n\nOmar and his lawyer at the San Francisco Bay Area\u2019s office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-SFBA) filed a religious discrimination complaint last month over the incident with California\u2019s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH).\n\nA DFEH spokesperson confirmed to HuffPost that Omar\u2019s complaint against Samsung was received but did not elaborate because the case is ongoing.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to take away from this,\u201d said Ammad Rafiqi, the civil rights and legal services coordinator at CAIR\u2019s SFBA office, is \u201cthat individuals are able to be judged by their qualifications, education and experiences, but also feel comfortable being valued members of the community.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer, who conducted his own investigation of the matter, said CAIR-SFBA and Omar may pursue other avenues if they aren\u2019t satisfied with how the DFEH complaint is addressed.\n\nA Samsung spokesperson told HuffPost in an email statement that the company \u201dis committed to a diverse workplace that respects the rights of all individuals\u201d and promotes \u201ca professional and inclusive culture.\u201d The spokesperson would not confirm if the interviewer Omar identified is still employed by Samsung, but said the company \u201ctakes complaints very seriously\u201d and would address Omar\u2019s complaint \u201cthrough the legal process.\u201d\n\nA LinkedIn profile of the manager who interviewed Omar indicates he is still employed at Samsung.\n\nOmar said he had quickly reached out to Samsung\u2019s human resources department and, in emails HuffPost has reviewed, detailed the problematic interview. He specifically inquired about a course of action to ensure no other Muslim or other religious minority would face similar questions.\n\nEventually, Omar said, an HR representative responded by phone with what he called a \u201chalf-hearted\u201d apology over the last interviewer\u2019s actions. But the representative, he said, did not mention any repercussions for the interviewer or any preventative action.\n\nOmar said he has not heard back from the company since the HR representative\u2019s call. He said that during the past year, after realizing his concerns would not be addressed by Samsung, he worked with CAIR before filing the DFEH complaint on Oct. 24.\n\nQuestions about an applicant\u2019s religious belief or practices, unless directly required for a position, such as being a religious organization\u2019s leader, is prohibited by federal law.\n\n\u201cWhat I would have liked to have heard is that they were taking measures to make sure this kind of thing isn\u2019t going to happen again,\u201d Omar told HuffPost. \u201cI\u2019m surprised at the fact that Samsung, being such a big company as it is, doesn\u2019t do more to ensure that this sort of outcome isn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nSamsung has 30 days to respond to the complaint filed with DFEH. Omar is still employed at the technology company he worked for at the time of the interviews, a Samsung competitor. He said his experience with Samsung has made him \u201cmore conscious\u201d that such discrimination can occur, even before someone is hired.\n\n\u201cI feel like I always knew that these things sort of happened, but it didn\u2019t really manifest itself like the way it did with Samsung,\u201d Omar said. \u201cIt really made it clear there are some unwritten rules and unspoken realities in corporate America.\u201d"}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "Ed Mazza", "title": "John Oliver Reveals What Trump Has In Common With The World\u2019s Worst Despots", "description": "The \"Last Week Tonight\" host signs off for the year with a terrifying warning about the not-too-distant future.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-oliver-authoritarianism_us_5bf27b50e4b07573881ff5fd", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf286b51d00000402313365.jpeg?ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T10:40:51Z", "content": "John Oliver took a look at the rise of authoritarian leaders around the world on Sunday and examined just how close President Donald Trump has come to joining their ranks.

Since Season 1, the logo at the end of the sequence has been constantly decaying. At first, the effect seemed cool, but at some point it\u2019s going to just disappear altogether, right?\n\n\u201cOr it\u2019ll be rebuilt,\u201d executive producer David Alpert told me at San Diego Comic-Con over the summer.\n\nAnd here we are. In Season 9, \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d revamped the opening credits thanks to design company Huge Designs, giving the show a new animated sequence along with an ending logo that has traded its decomposition for some new, green overgrowth.\n\n\u201cThat came from [showrunner Angela Kang] at a very early stage. The new series is a \u2018new beginning,\u2019 and so she wanted to say that from the outset,\u201d said Huge Designs animator Paul McDonnell.\n\nIn an email interview with HuffPost prior to Andrew Lincoln\u2019s departure episode, the creators of the title sequence, including McDonnell and designer Tamsin McGee, as well as Kang and \u201cWalking Dead\u201d producer Ryan DeGard, explained some of the sequence\u2019s hidden Easter eggs.\n\nBut first, if you\u2019re planning on hunting for them all, good luck. There are more on the way, according to DeGard.\n\n\u201c[Fans] having a 100 percent complete handle on where [all the Easter eggs are] would be very impressive!\u201d he said. \u201cWe also have plans to add a few more things as time goes on, so will they be able to keep up?\u201d\n\nIn fact, the Season 9 credits as a whole have some further updates coming up, Kang said when asked if the titles would be different in Season 10.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already working on some additional changes for Season 9, but we\u2019ll take it a season at a time!\u201d she said.\n\nThroughout our email discussion, the group wouldn\u2019t answer any questions that remotely touched on a spoiler, but they did reveal, among other things, that the credits underwent some timely changes to include images of a helicopter and a graveyard, additions meant to reflect storylines this season. We saw the helicopter used in Rick Grimes\u2019 last episode. Could some other graveyard moment still be coming?\n\n\u201cWalking Dead\u201d has had a similar title sequence since Season 1. What was the inspiration behind the new design? How did it evolve?\n\nTamsin McGee: The main point the titles needed to communicate was the sense of life emerging from death \u2026 nature taking over. Initially we looked to the comics, particularly \u201cA New Beginning,\u201d for visual references. There is one particular image that struck us as visually relevant and it shows Alexandria as a kind of utopian homestead with horses, livestock and vegetable gardens and, of course, a windmill. We liked the concept of this haven of community and the contrast of the horror that exists beyond the walls. Stylistically we also looked at Westerns for reference, such as low angles, rugged terrains and big, big skies. Alexandria totally reminded us of an isolated 19th-century frontier town and a great deal of the imagery was influenced by iconic Western references such as a hanging tree, skulls and horses. Another influence was the poems of Edgar Allan Poe. His main themes are generally associated with death and decomposition and reanimation of the dead.\n\nHow\u2019d you work together with Angela to create the new sequence?\n\nMcGee: Tone was really important. We had a tendency to go too bleak and grungy, and AMC encouraged us to push the elements of emerging nature and hope and to get the balance and message right.\n\nThe most enjoyable thing about the process was that we really felt that Angela was totally on board with the concept and trusted us right from the beginning \u2015 it gave us great confidence to produce something that we loved and felt had great integrity. Once the animation was pretty much nailed then the process of adding the \u201cEaster eggs\u201d began. We were sent references for objects over the course of several emails and then Paul would build them and hide them in the sequence. It was quite time-consuming to get the level of \u201chidden\u201d just right.\n\nI know you can\u2019t reveal too much about Easter eggs, but I do have some questions. What was your inclusion process? Were you just placing them wherever they could go, or do they serve a certain purpose?\n\nAngela Kang: Our post producer Ryan DeGard came up with the idea of the iconic objects hidden as Easter eggs. AMC wanted to maintain some sense of continuity with the prior iterations of the main titles and this seemed like a really fun and creative way to do it.\n\nRyan DeGard: In our past main titles, the iconic items from the show played a big role. It seemed like our show more than most really lends itself to iconic imagery \u2015 that the moment you see it, you know who or what the items represent or is tied to. I thought that including some of this stuff in different ways \u2015 from more in-your-face [stuff] like Negan\u2019s bat \u201cLucille\u201d or Daryl\u2019s original motorcycle to blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it items like Abraham\u2019s dog tags, etc. \u2015 was a fun way to engage our viewers in really taking part in the main title and having fun looking at what is in each corner of the frame for something new.\n\nI always enjoyed the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d use of the map and the fact that it would sometimes change based on locations used in the show. I always thought that was a fun way to keep the viewers\u2019 eyes on the beautiful main title and also inform them of possibly where you might end up that week.\n\nAt this point, do you think fans have found all the Easter eggs?\n\nKang: I have no idea! But a bunch of them are pretty well buried. I have a key that explains where every single object is located and it\u2019s still hard for me to find some of them again.\n\nAlso \u2014 one specific one \u2014 is that Glenn\u2019s/Hershel\u2019s pocket watch hanging from the cross grave or nah?\n\nKang: Yes, that is Glenn\u2019s Hilltop grave in the graveyard. Maggie had hung the watch on it before later taking it back.\n\nAMC RIP Glenn.\n\nSome of the imagery obviously seems very tied to Season 9. How are you telling the Season 9 story with the title sequence?\n\nKang: We\u2019re trying to hint at the themes of the season in the titles without getting too much into specific storylines. It\u2019s a time of rebuilding, and the effects of nature and the environment on our heroes is something we explore. The hangman\u2019s noose attached to the barn was a nod to both the Western vibe of the season as well as the specific events of the premiere. The helicopter is something we\u2019ll learn more about this season as well, but from a design standpoint, what I loved was the odd juxtaposition of images of nature and the Western frontier with something that\u2019s so clearly of the industrial age.\n\nWhat were some of the images that were originally included that you later changed?\n\nMcGee: The titles didn\u2019t change a huge amount from our original boards. Plot elements were snuck in that we didn\u2019t know about \u2015 for instance, the graveyard and the helicopter. A couple of things were dropped and replaced with more relevant scenes. We had a rusty old VW beetle which became Daryl\u2019s bike and we really fleshed out Alexandria adding the barn time lapse and the windmill got a couple of coats of paint! And we swapped out vultures for crows.\n\nWhat\u2019s the deal with the crows?\n\nPaul McDonnell: The crow represents several things. They are carrion eaters and love flesh, and they hang out in murders, so could be seen to represent the Walkers. They also are considered to be harbingers of death and symbolize ominous fortune and change. They also represent the re-emergence of the natural world over man. As nature continues to take over through Season 9, you will start to see more and more birds in the sky.\n\nKnowing it\u2019s Rick Grimes\u2019 final season, how did that affect the titles?\n\nKang: In some ways, it didn\u2019t. Rick\u2019s exit is one massive storyline in a season of massive storylines, and the titles really had to work for the entire season.\n\nWhat behind-the-scenes secrets do you know about the titles that you think are fun or interesting?\n\nMcDonnell: The close-up Walker eye was [Huge Designs\u2019 director Hugo Moss\u2019] eye after a heavy night. We often try to get ourselves into our sequences, and we did shoot ourselves green screen for the end crowd shot but our walker moves just weren\u2019t good enough to make the cut."}, {"source": {"id": "the-huffington-post", "name": "The Huffington Post"}, "author": "David Barden", "title": "\u2018We Are Smarter Than That\u2019: Finns Hilariously Mock Trump\u2019s \u2018Raking\u2019 Solution", "description": "The President of Finland can't recall ever suggesting to Trump that raking could prevent wildfires.", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/finland-trump-raking-california-fires_us_5bf216fbe4b0f32bd58ab6b9", "urlToImage": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bf2212d2600009303847c92.jpeg?cache=egjkm1fnq0&ops=1910_1000", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T03:12:17Z", "content": "Finns have taken President Donald Trump to task over his wild assertion that their forest nation avoids deadly blazes by spending a lot of time on raking and cleaning.

The fire was 60 percent contained as of Sunday, officials said.\n\nMany were flummoxed by the president\u2019s claims and experts quickly moved to cast them as misleading. A forest fires expert at the Finnish Interior Ministry told The New York Times that raking isn\u2019t a normal practice in Finland (70 percent of which is covered by forest) but that the country removes dead trees when possible.\n\n\u201cOf course, we have a big country and we can\u2019t do it everywhere,\u201d the expert, Rami Ruuska, told the Times. The outlet noted that the Finnish climate is also vastly different from California\u2019s, far colder and not nearly as dry.\n\nThe country also has an active early-warning system that includes aerial surveys to alert the public of any imminent threat.\n\nTrump was also roundly lambasted for telling reporters this weekend that his opinion of climate change hadn\u2019t been changed by the scope of the fire.\n\n\u201cNo. No. I have a strong opinion,\u201d the president said, before adding: \u201cI want great climate. We\u2019re going to have that, and we\u2019re going to have forests that are very safe.\u201d\n\nAs the Camp fire first began to spread last week, the president initially moved to blame the blaze on what he called the \u201cgross mismanagement\u201d of forests and threatened to cut off federal aid. He offered no condolences at the time.\n\nThere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor.
