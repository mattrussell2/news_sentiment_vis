Reporter: Tonight, it took two drama-filled recounts before Republican Rick Scott was officially declared the winner in Florida's contentious senate race. State election officials racing to meet today's noon deadline, We made it with one second to spare. Reporter: After the last recount Scott's razor-thin lead just 10,000 votes. It's been 12 days of tension, but three-term senator bill Nelson conceding today. Well, things worked out a little differently than grace and I had hoped. But let me say, I by no measure feel defeated. Reporter: Complicating the recounts even more this weekend? Missing ballots. Chaos and questions plaguing Broward county, Florida, when election officials discovered more than 2000 ballots missing. The ballots are in this building. There would be nowhere else for them to be. Reporter: In the race for governor, Tallahassee's democratic mayor Andrew Gillum conceded the race to Republican Ron Desantis. R.J. And I wanted to take a moment to congratulate Mr. Desantis. Reporter: Meanwhile president trump, who tweeted his support of Scott today, claiming victory in the recently decided Georgia governor's race. Hello, Georgia! Reporter: Which had Oprah Winfrey stumping for the Democrat. And I won against president Obama and Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama in a great state called Georgia for the governor. Let's get to Stephanie now. Stephanie, president trump is still boasting about Republican success in the midterm. Some of the success. But there was also a significant win for Democrats in California. Reporter: Absolutely, Tom. California is a blue state. But some of the suburbs of los Angeles like in Orange county have been traditionally very conservative for decades. Over the weekend, Gil Cisneros won a closely watched house race. Turning all four house seats in Orange county, one of the most conservative areas in the nation, blue. Tom? A big pickup for Democrats there.

But while the president may think he's finished Anning questions, ah the special counsel has yet to reveal his timeline. Here's ABC white house correspondent Tara Palmeri. Reporter: Tonight president trump making it clear he alone is the one answering special counsel Robert Mueller's questions. Your team is preparing written answers to questions about -- No, no. Not my team. I'm preparing written answers. My -- I -- I'm the one that does the answering. Reporter: Those answers are now finished, and he says will be submitted soon. The president also all but ruling out a sitdown interview. I think we've wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is probably, we're finished. Reporter: When it comes to acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker, the president saying he has free rein to limit the Mueller probe. If Whitaker decides in any way to limit or curtail the Mueller investigation, are you okay with that? Look, he -- it's going to be up to him. I think he's very well aware politically. I think he's astute politically. He's going to do what's right. I really believe he's going to do what's right. Reporter: In the past Whitaker has been critical of the case and laid out how it could be stifled. I could see a scenario where Jeff sessions is replaced with a recess appointment. And that attorney general doesn't fire Bob Mueller, but he just reduces the budget so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt. Reporter: Today Democrat Adam Schiff claimed Whitaker's temporary appointment should require a senate approval, calling it unconstitutional. The biggest flaw from my point of view is that he was chosen for the purpose of interfering with the Mueller investigation. He auditioned for the part by going on TV and saying he could hobble the investigation. Reporter: Trump claims he was unaware of Whitaker's position and went on Twitter to blast Schiff by changing the spelling of his name to an expletive. Tara joins us from the white house. I want to turn to a different topic. The president also making news for something he said about retired admiral bill Mcraven who commanded the operation that killed Osama bin laden. The president responded to Mcraven's claims that his attacks on the media are the greatest threat to democracy that he has seen in his life. Here's the president. He's a Hillary Clinton backer. And an Obama backer. And, frankly -- He's a Navy S.E.A.L. Wouldn't it have been nice if we got Osama bin laden sooner than that? Wouldn't it have been nice. Living -- think of this. Living in Pakistan. Beautifully in Pakistan. In what I guess they consider a nice mansion. I don't know. I have seen nicer. And Tara, Mcraven firing back tonight? Reporter: He denies he ever backed Clinton or any other candidate in 2016. He is standing by his statement. He says I'm a fan of president Obama and president George W. Bush.

President Trump congratulated Scott in a tweet, writing: \"From day one Rick Scott never wavered. He was a great Governor and will be even a greater Senator in representing the People of Florida.\"\n\nIt marks the end of a long and at-times messy vote recount that drew national attention amid reported irregularities in vote counting by county officials, problems with tabulation machines and missed deadlines.\n\nIt also marks the end of Democrats' hopes in Florida's two high-profile elections this year. On Saturday, Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum conceded to Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis in the governor's race. In defeat, Gillum drew praise from Trump on Twitter afterward. Recounting had stopped in that race after Thursday's conclusion of a machine recount.\n\nSenate recounting, however, had continued, with county officials hand-examining a subset of votes, checking thousands of them for voters' marks that could have been missed by scanning machines.\n\nFlorida's 67 counties faced a noon Sunday deadline to finish hand-recounting ballots in the Senate and state agriculture-commissioner races. All of them made it, the Florida Department of State told ABC News.\n\nAfter the final round of recounting had finished, Scott still led Nelson by 10,033 votes -- a slightly narrower margin than the 12,603 by which he led after the first round of recounting was completed.\n\nJoe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nTwo counties in particular -- Broward and Palm Beach, both large, Democratic strongholds in South Florida -- drew attention and GOP criticism throughout the process.\n\nIn Broward, Election Supervisor Brenda Snipes was sued successfully by Scott's campaign over her failure to provide results on time after Election Day. Her office reportedly intermingled 22 provisional ballots that shouldn't have been counted, within a batch of 205. On Thursday, the county failed to upload results to a state website after the first round of recounting, missing the deadline by minutes.\n\nOver the weekend, after Snipes's office had completed recounting in the Senate race on Friday but continued recounting in the state's agriculture commissioner race, she acknowledged her staff may have misplaced more than 2,000 ballots as it sought to finalize totals in that state-level race. Senate tallies had already been completed.\n\n\"The ballots are in the building,\" she said at a canvassing board meeting on Saturday, seeking to reassure those in attendance. \"The ballots are in the building.\"\n\nIn Palm Beach, Elections Supervisor Susan Bucher said her counting machines overheated and stopped working multiple times, as the county raced to meet the state's 3 p.m. Thursday deadline in the machine recount. Palm Beach missed that deadline on Thursday and had to continue running the machines afterward. The manufacturer of the machines pushed back, suggesting county officials were running the machines in an unusual way, in comments to The Palm Beach Post.\n\nPalm Beach made Sunday's deadline by one second, Palm Beach Elections Supervisor Susan Bucher told ABC affiliate WPBF, showing a readout of her office's upload of results to the state website reading 11:59:59.\n\nTwo rounds of recounting had ensued after Scott and Nelson were separated by just .15 percentage points after Election Day -- a narrow enough margin to trigger an automatic machine recount. With the race still close enough after Florida's first round of recounting concluded on Thursday, county election officials hand-examined a subset of votes since Friday, in some cases racing to meet the deadline.\n\nRhona Wise/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFlorida's recount was the subject of at least a dozen lawsuits, as the campaigns, national political parties, and outside groups wrangled over the counting of late mail-in votes, considerations of voter intent when examining hand-marked ballots, and the physical security of ballots and tabulation machines at county election facilities where recounting was underway.\n\nThe troubled process prompted incoming Florida Senate President Bill Galvano to tell reporters the state legislature would examine Florida's election laws for potential changes, ABC affiliate WPBF reported.\n\nNelson's hopes dwindled late last week, as court challenges were struck down and as vote counting in Broward failed to yield extra votes. In that heavily Democratic county, some 26,000 more votes were cast in the state's governor's race, hinting at a possibility that hand-examining ballots there could yield votes for Nelson. But as that count finished Friday, he had gained just over 400 votes -- not nearly enough to overcome the deficit.\n\nScott's win gives Republicans a net gain of two Senate seats in the 2018 midterms and a prospective advantage, heading into next year, of 52 seats to 47.\n\nMississippi is currently holding a runoff in its U.S. Senate seat, to be held Nov. 27."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Cyprus gets back looted 6th century mosaic of St. Mark", "description": "Cyprus' communications minister says an extremely rare, 6th century portrait mosaic of St. Mark which was looted from the east Mediterranean island has now returned safely after decades abroad", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/cyprus-back-looted-6th-century-mosaic-st-mark-59280547", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T20:24:52Z", "content": "The communications minister of Cyprus says a rare 6th-century portrait mosaic of St. Mark which was looted from an Orthodox Christian church more than four decades ago has returned intact to the Mediterranean island nation.

Add Immigration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Immigration news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nHundreds of Tijuana residents congregated around a monument in an affluent section of the city south of California on Sunday to protest the thousands of Central American migrants who have arrived via caravan in hopes of a new life in the U.S.\n\nTensions have built as nearly 3,000 migrants from the caravan poured into Tijuana in recent days after more than a month on the road, and with many more months ahead of them while they seek asylum. The federal government estimates the number of migrants could soon swell to 10,000.\n\nU.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana's main crossing to San Diego. Asylum seekers register their names in a tattered notebook managed by migrants themselves that had more than 3,000 names even before the caravan arrived.\n\nOn Sunday, displeased Tijuana residents waved Mexican flags, sang the Mexican national anthem and chanted \"Out! Out!\" in front of a statue of the Aztec ruler Cuauhtemoc, 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from the U.S. border. They accused the migrants of being messy, ungrateful and a danger to Tijuana. They also complained about how the caravan forced its way into Mexico, calling it an \"invasion.\" And they voiced worries that their taxes might be spent to care for the group.\n\n\"We don't want them in Tijuana,\" protesters shouted.\n\nJuana Rodriguez, a housewife, said the government needs to conduct background checks on the migrants to make sure they don't have criminal records.\n\nA woman who gave her name as Paloma lambasted the migrants, who she said came to Mexico in search of handouts. \"Let their government take care of them,\" she told video reporters covering the protest.\n\nA block away, fewer than a dozen Tijuana residents stood with signs of support for the migrants. Keyla Zamarron, a 38-year-old teacher, said the protesters don't represent her way of thinking as she held a sign saying: Childhood has no borders.\n\nMost of the migrants who have reached Tijuana via caravan in recent days set out more than a month ago from Honduras, a country of 9 million people. Dozens of migrants in the caravan who have been interviewed by Associated Press reporters have said they left their country after death threats.\n\nBut the journey has been hard, and many have turned around.\n\nAlden Rivera, the Honduran ambassador in Mexico, told the AP on Saturday that 1,800 Hondurans have returned to their country since the caravan first set out on Oct. 13, and that he hopes more will make that decision. \"We want them to return to Honduras,\" said Rivera.\n\nHonduras has a murder rate of 43 per 100,000 residents, similar to U.S. cities like New Orleans and Detroit. In addition to violence, migrants in the caravan have mentioned poor economic prospects as a motivator for their departures. Per capita income hovers around $120 a month in Honduras, where the World Bank says two out of three people live in poverty.\n\nThe migrants' expected long stay in Tijuana has raised concerns about the ability of the border city of more than 1.6 million people to handle the influx.\n\nWhile many in Tijuana are sympathetic to the migrants' plight and trying to assist, some locals have shouted insults, hurled rocks and even thrown punches at them. The cold reception contrasts sharply with the warmth that accompanied the migrants in southern Mexico, where residents of small towns greeted them with hot food, campsites and even live music.\n\nTijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum has called the migrants' arrival an \"avalanche\" that the city is ill-prepared to handle, calculating that they will be in Tijuana for at least six months as they wait to file asylum claims. Gastelum has appealed to the federal government for more assistance to cope with the influx.\n\nMexico's Interior Ministry said Saturday that the federal government was flying in food and blankets for the migrants in Tijuana.\n\nTijuana officials converted a municipal gymnasium and recreational complex into a shelter to keep migrants out of public spaces. The city's privately run shelters have a maximum capacity of 700. The municipal complex can hold up to 3,000.\n\nAt the municipal shelter, Josue Caseres, 24, expressed dismay at the protests against the caravan. \"We are fleeing violence,\" said the entertainer from Santa Barbara, Honduras. \"How can they think we are going to come here to be violent?\"\n\nSome from the caravan have diverted to other border cities, such as Mexicali, a few hours to the east of Tijuana.\n\nElsewhere on Sunday, a group of 200 migrants headed north from El Salvador, determined to also find safety in numbers to reach the U.S. Edwin Alexander Gomez, 20, told AP in San Salvador that he wants to work construction in New York, where he hears the wages are better and the city is safer.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, who sought to make the caravan a campaign issue in the midterm elections, used Twitter on Sunday to voice support for the mayor of Tijuana and try to discourage the migrants from seeking entry to the U.S.\n\nTrump wrote that like Tijuana, \"the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!\"\n\nHe followed that tweet by writing: \"Catch and Release is an obsolete term. It is now Catch and Detain. Illegal Immigrants trying to come into the U.S.A., often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for U.S. Asylum, will be detained or turned away.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nGuthrie reported from Mexico City.

Peru said it would provide Uruguay with unspecified information to help it in its evaluation of the asylum request.\n\nGarcia is under investigation for bribes allegedly paid during the construction of Lima's metro during his 2006-2011 government. He downplayed the threat of arrest when he arrived home on Thursday from Madrid, where he splits his time.\n\n\"For me it's not a punishment to be confined 18 months to my homeland,\" he said while denying that he had ever received money from Odebrecht.\n\nGarcia, 69, was a populist firebrand whose erratic first presidency in the 1980s was marked by hyperinflation, rampant corruption and the rise of the Shining Path guerrilla movement.\n\nWhen he returned to power two decades later he ran a more conservative government, helping usher in a commodities-led investment boom in which Odebrecht played a major supporting role.\n\nThis is the second time Garcia has sought to flee to another country amid corruption charges.

There you have it, the freshman class for the incoming 116th congress. As you saw earlier from our conversation on the hill a record number of women were elected to the house. All but one of them are Democrats. Our colleagues at 538 note that just 15% of the women in the next congress will be Republicans, down from 27% currently serving. We're going to talk about that and much more with our round table. Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, Stephanie cutter, reihan Salam, author of the new book \"Melting pot or civil war\" and Mary Jordan. Welcome, everybody. I'll start with you, Mary Jordan. You saw the incoming class picture. You heard the women I talked to. Do you think they make a difference? I think in all the excitement and gains we've been talking about 3-4 members of congress are still men. We're still behind most of the rest of the world. First of all, men are still in charge here. There is enormous amount of new energy to get things done. A lot of women who were never in politics are coming to the hill. They're going to bring fresh perspective and focus on two things. I heard over and over they're going to focus on health care and stopping the incivility and trying to heal things. If they do that, that would be pretty significant change in conversation on capitol hill. Everyone comes in with a great agenda. We hope they keep their energy up. Chris Christie, to that point about women, congress newest members were up on capitol hill. Let's look at the Republican freshman class in the house to rub it in. Look at the faces there. Here is just some of the democratic freshman class. Little bit different. Should that lack of racial and gender diversity be cause for concern among Republicans, especially when you look at the midterms? Listen, we should always be looking for ways to make our party more diverse and more representative of what the country looks like. That should be a goal. I come from the most ethnically diverse state in America. For me the fact that my party, let's say in New Jersey, looks significantly different than that class picture says it's possible. We're not talking just about New Jersey. We have just had the midterms. What do they need to do? You've got to focus on it and recruit. A lot of the candidates that came in on the democratic side had never been in politics. How did they get there? Some of them were self motivated to get there. Some of them, Martha, were recruited. It's incumbent on the party to go out and recruit members of country, citizens of our country who believe in Republican philosophies and get them to come in to give our party a more diverse look at what is going on and how we solve some of the problems the country has. Speaking of those problems, Stephanie, the midterms went for the Democrats from good to you might say great. You still have a Republican senate and a Republican in the white house. What happens in the next two years? How do you bridge that divide? The Democrats have two roads. One is to get things done. I was struck by the women you interviewed and they were talking about paid leave. The current house of representatives wouldn't even bring it to a vote. I guarantee you under democratic leadership that will be brought to a vote. That will be brought to a vote and that will matter to people to see their congress doing something that impacts their daily life. The second thing is I think this house will be an important check on this president's power. That's a necessary part of democracy. Whether it's an abuse of power through cabinet agencies, our the president making proper rules without the processor demonizing certain members of our society, those are the types of things that I think this house of representatives and one of the reasons they were elected is to make sure that abuse of power, there's some sort of check on it. That's the checks and balances. On this side of the table we have our partisans. On this side, I'll go to you reihan. President trump called the senate results an epic victory. You wrote you see troubling signs for the Republicans. That's right. The Republican party is eroding among suburban, upper income, college-aged voters. Those voters were enormously important in 2016. He has the support of some white working class voters. He seems to have lost some of that support and he has not built support among working class voters who are not white. When you think about the party's long-term trajectory, it's voter base has become a lot more suburban and affluent. That creates an opportunity for Republicans to relate to a wider swath. To really do that, you need not just cultural politics, you need something more substantive as well on economic and domestic policy. That's what we haven't seen from the president even though he seems to have those instincts. Right before the election we need a middle class tax cut. He said I'm going to give you a middle class tax cut. That didn't happen, but he realizes that running against a safety net that doesn't necessarily speak to working class voters, he didn't do that in 2016. Mary, you're out there with the voters as a reporter. Donald Trump got enormous amounts of traction by talking about I'm going to take care of the forgotten men and women. When I'm talking to people out there, many of these people who believed him and voted for him, they still feel forgotten. Especially for people -- yes, there's a bump in the economy, but I don't think people feel they got what they wanted from Donald Trump. 2020 is going to be all about that. It's about who's going to help the middle class people. We think there's -- there's a feeling the rich people are doing just fine. 2020 is going to be about the middle class. Stephanie, I want to go to you. Speaking of 2020, let's take a look at Florida. Andrew Gillum conceded in the governor's race. Doesn't look like the Democrats will hold the senate. I think the final recount is today. Looking into 2020 can Democrats win back the white house without Florida, without Ohio which was also very red? They can. It's very difficult. There are pathways. Florida is the ultimate battle ground for Democrats and Republicans. You see it switching back and forth every two years. We've got a lot of work to do there. It's a recount. It's a very close race. We need to look very carefully and what are the lessons we can learn. How can we better organize? What went wrong? There's no reason why Nelson shouldn't be winning handedly. We were fortunate to expand our playing ground, bringing Arizona into the democratic column. That gives us opportunities to get to 270 votes in a presidential election. I guess I would say, while we had great results two weeks ago, looking at the lessons learned from 2018 and how they apply to 2020, we have a tremendous amount of work to do. Chris, I want to ask you another race getting attention is the senate race in Mississippi. The president announced he'll be there to campaign for Cindy Hyde Smith who is in a run-off race. That's against democratic Mike espy. It should be an easy win for the Republicans until this happened. If he invited me to a public hanging, I would be in the front row she's saying to a supporter there. How concerned are you about the race? We have to be concerned when candidates say stupid things. I remember when I was chairman of the rga in 2014. In 2012 a lot of Republican candidates talked about rape. I told them if anybody says the word rape, I'm not going to fund your campaign. I think the Republican will still win. I think it will be much more watched. When candidates say things that aren't right, aren't smart, they get more attention. I would say one other thing about 2020. Every president goes through this, president Obama, president Clinton, president bush 43. When you go through a midterm and the results aren't what you wanted or worse, it's time for re-examination. A re-examination of how you're going to present yourself. I think even more so for this president because he has a democratic house he has to deal with. He has to decide does he want to be the New York deal maker, which is part of the way he ran, or does he want to be a doctrine Republican. I think, reihan, what you're saying is right. He has the opportunity to grow the Republican base. In a way that's going to play into the map Stephanie spoke about. It's his decision. He has to decide to do it. Isn't it a red alert that Republicans can't get women to vote for him? That's not true, Mary. Polls show there's a profound gender gap that we've never seen. There's always been one. Not like this. This is a record. Right. This was a bigger gap in a midterm election. Let's see what happens in the presidential year election when a greater number of people turn out to vote. You should be concerned about who's not voting for you. You want them to vote for you whether it's gender based, ethnicity based or regional or based upon educational background and after -- affluence. You want every vote you can get. At this point in 2010, the pundits gave president Obama a 17% chance of winning re-election. We sat down and figured out what do we need to do to change. We decided we needed to expand the groups we were talking to, not just our base, but those we needed to persuade that we were on a pathway to a better future. Compare that to president trump threatening to shut down the government over his border wall and using the caravan as a message to divide us. Is he learning that lesson? I don't know. I'm pretty confident as I recall 2010 that that didn't happen within 12 days of the midterm. He sat down over a period of weeks and said these are the numbers. Here's what we have to do. You know what he wasn't doing? He wasn't threatening to shut down the government over an issue that has already divided the country. The partisans are on this side of the table. I'm going to launch to this side of the table. I know we want to launch ahead to 2020, reihan. What about the next two years? What do you see happening in the white house? We heard a lot about staff shake-ups. We see president trump who appears to be getting a little unsettled about all this. What are you seeing in terms of the trump white house now and where he goes in the next two years? One important thing to keep in mind is that Donald Trump presented himself as an independent figure, a figure different and distinct than conventional mainstream Republicans. When you had speaker Paul Ryan who is dedicated to an agenda that dated back to the '90s, that did wind up constraining president trump. The fact that president trump on more than one occasion has said he's willing to find Republican votes to back speaker Pelosi, you could say that's just being playful. He's repeatedly said I want to talk about infrastructure, middle class tax cuts. His daughter ivanka was talking about paid leave. It's possible he's going to try to triangulate. Whether or not he can succeed in doing that given the fact that people have strong opinions about him, is an open question. Clearly the president wants to shake the kaleidoscope of politics. Ten seconds. When he ran before, he didn't have a record. Now he has a record and people are going to say where's the infrastructure? Where's the help for the middle class? All of us voted for you.

Blockades were counted at 150 scattered locations Sunday, Castaner told RTL radio. Protesters were notably in Rennes, in western France, Avignon, in the south, and Nancy, in the east, where police moved in to clear them.\n\nThe situation throughout the night was \"agitated,\" Castaner said, with \"aggressions, fights, knife-slashing\" taking place, including among the protesters.\n\nOverall, 157 people were detained for questioning - double the number reported Saturday night.\n\nThe upstart movement behind the weekend protests represents middle-class citizens and those with fewer means who rely on their cars to get to work. The protesters called themselves \"yellow jackets\" after the safety vests French drivers are obliged to keep in their cars for emergencies.\n\nWhile it was unclear if the weekend's momentum would continue, the movement is posing a challenge to French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\n\"I hear what the French are saying. It's very clear,\" the prime minister said Sunday. \"But a government that ... zigzags according to the difficulties, what too many past governments have done, that won't lead France to where it must be.\"\n\nMacron wants to close the gap between the price of diesel fuel and gasoline as part of his strategy to wean France off fossil fuels. A \"carbon trajectory\" calls for continued increases, particularly on diesel.\n\nPhilippe said more explaining is needed \"and we will do that,\" while adhering to the plan. He vowed that results would be in at the end of Macron's mandate in 2022 - and good for the French.\n\nTaxes on diesel fuel have gone up 7 euro cents (nearly 8 U.S. cents) and are to keep climbing in the coming years, Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne has said. The tax on gasoline is to increase 4 euro cents.\n\nMacron, whose popularity ratings are sliding regularly, has not commented.\n\n\"I don't think silence is the right answer,\" said Troyes Mayor Francois Baroin, a former mainstream right minister and senator before the prime minister spoke. The Troyes prefecture was invaded and damaged by protesters on Saturday.\n\n\"It's a very powerful message sent from the depths of France,\" he said on BFMTV."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "'Fantastic Beasts' flies to top of weekend box office", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Its reviews were largely lackluster, with critics saying Rowling's magical world is wearing thin after 10 films.\n\nGlobally the first nine films have earned $8.5 billion, a total that this one's worldwide take will inflate.\n\n\"This is yet another example of a movie whose opening weekend skewed heavily into the international territories,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore. \"This happens a lot with bigger franchise movies. For many of these blockbusters, it's the international component that comes in and saves the day.\"\n\nIn the U.S., Warner Bros. is hoping young devotees who are out of school will keep \"Fantastic Beasts\" in flight through Thanksgiving.\n\n\"It's a big week coming up,\" Goldstein said. \"Friday is one of the biggest movie days of the year.\"\n\nIt will have a major challenger in Disney's \"Ralph Breaks The Internet,\" which opens Wednesday, as does \"Creed II.\"\n\n\"Fantastic Beasts\" continues a year of high points and hits for Warner from a diverse string of movies, including \"The Meg,\" ''Crazy Rich Asians,\" ''The Nun\" and \"A Star is Born.\"\n\n\"Warner Bros. is on a roll that every studio would envy,\" Dergarabedian said.\n\nIn this weekend's smaller-budget openings, \"Instant Family\" starring Mark Wahlberg brought in $14.7 million for Paramount Pictures, and \"Widows,\" the latest from \"12 Years a Slave\" director Steve McQueen, earned $12.3 million domestically and $2.8 million internationally for 20th Century Fox. \"Instant Family\" has only opened in North America.\n\nOverall, the weekend was down 14.5 percent in the U.S. and Canada from the same timeframe a year earlier, when \"Justice League\" made for a major pre-Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nHere are estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to comScore.

Wickremesinghe says he still has the support of a majority in Parliament.\n\nOn Sunday, president Sirisena chaired the meeting attended by Rajapaksa, Wickremesinghe and other political leaders. Talks came two days after the parliament passed the second no-confidence motions against Rajapaksa who has so far refused to accept the results of the motion and continues to perform as prime minister.\n\nAjith Perera, a lawmaker from Wickremesinghe's party, told reporters that Sunday's meeting failed to reach a breakthrough.\n\nHe said it is illegal for Rajapaksa and his government to stay in power after two no-confidence motions were passed against them. \"They are hanging on to power illegally,\" he said.\n\nParliament turned violent when the no-confidence motions were taken up last week, with rival lawmakers exchanging blows, injuring several.\n\nOn Friday, lawmakers supporting Rajapaksa threw books, chairs and chili powder mixed with water to try to block the proceedings.\n\nHowever, speaker Karu Jayasuriya, using a microphone, conducted the proceedings while standing on the floor of Parliament, which for the second time passed a no-confidence motion against Rajapaksa and his government by a voice vote.\n\nJayasuriya first offered to take the vote by name but was unable to do so because of the commotion and opted for a voice vote. He then adjourned the house until Monday. Parliament passed the first motion on Wednesday, also by voice vote due to the clashes.\n\nRajapaksa says the vote should not have been done by voice. He also insisted the speaker had no authority to remove him and said he is continuing in his role as prime minister.\n\nSirisena, as the head of the government, has the power to appoint the prime minister.\n\nSirisena has also rejected to accept the results of the no-confidence motions.\n\nAn opposition Marxist party \u2014Peoples' Liberation Party \u2014 boycotted the Sunday meeting, blaming Sirisena for creating the crisis for his \"personal conspiratorial political interest.\"\n\nIn a statement, the party said Sirisena is the \"architect of the anarchy and instability\" in the country and it could be corrected only by him.\n\nAt Sunday's meeting, Sirisena has told party leaders that he would take a decision on the no-confidence motions \"only if a vote is taken by name of the Members or by electronic voting,\" according to a statement from his office.\n\nSirisena has said voting on an important motion to change a government should not be done by a voice vote which he said he is not transparent.\n\nHarsha de Silva, another lawmaker Wickremesinghe's party criticized the meeting, saying Rajapaksa and his loyal lawmakers \"want to drag impasse along giving lame excuses of procedures\" as Rajapaksa does not have the majority in the 225-member house.\n\n\"Go, MR Go. For God's sake Go!,\" de Silva stated in his tweet. MR is the acronym for Mahinda Rajapaksa.\n\nRajapaksa, a former president, is considered a hero by some in the ethnic Sinhalese majority for ending a long civil war by crushing ethnic Tamil Tiger rebels. However, his time in power was marred by allegations of wartime atrocities, corruption and nepotism.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister. Sirisena has also accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, a charge Wickremesinghe has repeatedly denied.\n\nSirisena was the health minister of Rajapaksa's government, before he crossed over to the opposition and contested the 2015 presidential election as the common opposition candidate backed by Wickmremesinghe's party. He defeated Rajapaksa and the duo have been political rivals since then.\n\nHis move to appoint Rajapaksa as prime minister astonished many."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Roey Hadar", "title": "Hard to imagine crown prince not behind Khashoggi murder: Bipartisan Congress members", "description": "Rep.

The president says he's going to have some conclusions by Tuesday on this,\u201d Blunt said.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in California Saturday, Trump indicated the report will have details on who is responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s killing.\n\n\"We\u2019re going to come up with a report as to what we think the overall impact was and who caused it and who did it.

That's changing thanks to a booming trade in preowned luxury watches, driven by a growing number of specialized retailers. Established luxury watchmakers and dealers are also getting into the trade.\n\n\"Retailers seem to get much more excited about selling preowned than new because they can set the price,\" says Ariel Adams, founder of aBlogtoWatch, the foremost authority in watch blogs.\n\nFrom a vintage 1930s Cartier Tank to a gently worn 2017 Rolex Sea-Dweller, there are deals to be had. Here's a guide on how to score one:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWHERE TO BUY\n\nThe luxury watch you have coveted for years might no longer be out of reach. But where to start looking?\n\nThere are many dedicated online retailers like SwissWatchExpo and Second Time Around Watch Co. Traditional retailers like the iconic Tourneau chain also sell preowned watches in stores and online. Most established retailers offer pieces that have been serviced by watchmakers and tested for mechanical accuracy. To avoid knock-offs, check online reviews for the dealer.\n\nDon't discount online outlets that are not just for watches. Overstock and eBay offer thousands of well-priced luxury watches.\n\nTo get the lay of the land, start with industry websites like Hodinkee and aBlogtoWatch. There are also numerous YouTube video reviews and Instagram watch \"geek\" feeds.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWHAT TO BUY?\n\n\"The most important piece of information I tell people is: Buy a watch you want to wear,\" says Adams. \"Now that sounds really obvious. But a lot of people, without really knowing, try to follow other people's advice. Watches are like clothing: Just because someone really likes their pair of jeans that doesn't mean it will look good on you.\"\n\nPaul Boutros, head of Americas for auction house Philips Watches, cautions against approaching the watch as an investment.\n\n\"Buy watches because you love them,\" he says. \"As far as investment goes, it's best to invest in stocks or real estate.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHOW TO SCORE A DEAL\n\nTo figure out roughly how much you should pay, compare prices on online marketplaces like Germany-based Chrono24, where retailers and individuals list watches for sale. But watch collector Paul Bragan, a senior partner at market research firm Wakefield Research, cautions shoppers to take those figures with a grain of salt. The list price is often not what a watch ends up selling for, Bragan says.\n\nOnce you have price points, zero in on a good-condition piece. Many online retailers offer \"first-time buyer\" discounts or incentives for returning customers. Most offer email newsletters that will alert you to upcoming holiday sales, and not just for Christmas. Tourneau and online platform Watchbox offer sales tied to other holidays such as Independence Day and Labor Day.\n\nWatchbox's innovative app even allows you to offer your own price as a starting point.\n\nHave a watch you don't wear anymore? As with cars, figure out if you can trade it in for your dream piece.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nCONSIDER THE \"GREY MARKET\"\n\nIf you really want a new piece, consider the so-called \"grey market.\" Brand-authorized dealers often offload excess inventory onto third-party websites. Those sites, in turn, will offer discounts of roughly a third on new and unworn pieces. But there's a catch: Those third-party sellers can't offer warranties against defects or mechanical failures.\n\n\"The grey market is just for that customer that wants a special big deal,\" says Steven Kaiser, founder of New York-based luxury industry consulting firm Kaiser Time. \"You are always going to have that customer.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nPAY ATTENTION TO THE FINE PRINT\n\nThere are details to consider beyond the sale price. How much of a warranty does the seller offer? Does it cover water damage? What's the return policy? Does it include a restocking fee? If you are on the hook for return shipping costs, that could be good chunk of cash if you need to insure the package.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDON'T FORGET INSURANCE\n\nMany home insurance policies cover personal possessions but it's usually worth getting a separate \"valuable item\" policy for peace of mind. Many such supplemental policies cover theft or loss away outside the home.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWHAT ABOUT WOMEN'S WATCHES\n\n\"It's a man's game,\" says Watchbox founder Danny Govberg, who estimates that only 5 percent of preowned watches on the market are designed for women.\n\nBut that's good news for female watch enthusiasts. It usually means better deals for the smaller-dial Rolexes and Omegas.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTAKE CARE OF THE WATCH\n\nLuxury watches are made to last decades, but they require care. Mechanical pieces need more care than those that run on batteries, known as quartz watches.\n\n\"You should make sure it's wound at least weekly and running at least weekly,\" says Susanna Woycitzky, watchmaker at Watchbox. She adds that you should also keep your watch away from magnets, including those on iPad covers, purses and money clips.\n\nMost watches are waterproof but it's best not to test it.\n\n\"Don't take them swimming in the Mediterranean,\" says Christian Zeron, founder of online retailer Theo&Harris.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Amir Bibawy on Twitter @AmirBibawy"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Watch geeks drive booming trade in preowned pieces", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Surrounded by computer monitors, loud conversation and ringing phones, the energy on this trading floor is high and the commodity is blingy.\n\nAt the headquarters of Govberg, they're not dealing in diamonds or gold but preowned luxury watches, of which company sells about $200 million worth a year.\n\nSome 100 miles (160 kilometers) northeast, 23-year-old Christian Zeron sits in his parents' dining room in suburban New Jersey looking at around 30 preowned vintage watches. In a few days, he'll put them up for sale on his company's website, theoandharris.com, which sells $2 million worth of watches annually.\n\nGovberg, in the watch business for 35 years, and Theo&Harris, founded only three years ago, are part of the thriving preowned luxury watch business. Along with dozens of other companies, they are the core of an industry that has exploded over the past few years, rivaling the new luxury timepiece business in size.\n\n\"It's bigger than people think,\" said Reginald Brack, executive director and industry analyst for watches and luxury at NPD Group, which studies $2 trillion in consumer spending across 20 industries.\n\nBrack said it's difficult to quantify precisely the market for preowned watches because nobody tracks it thoroughly. But some estimates put it at three times the new luxury watch market, itself estimated to be worth up to $10 billion just in the U.S.\n\n\"I wouldn't disagree with that statement,\" Brack said. \"And it's only getting bigger.\"\n\nEven though watches have been disappearing from people's wrists with the spread of mobile phones, luxury watches remain a popular status symbol. In fact, sales have slightly crept up in the last two years.\n\nThe preowned business allows shoppers to get a good deal on modern watches like Rolex Submariner, while also offering a large selection of vintage pieces like an early 20th Century Cartier Tank.\n\nDanny Govberg, the founder of Govberg's global watch operation WatchBox, compared the rise of preowned watches to the \"quartz revolution\" nearly five decades ago.\n\nThe introduction of battery-operated quartz movements in wristwatches took a big bite out of the market share from major automatic or mechanical watch brands such as Rolex, Omega, Patek Philippe, Jaeger-LeCoultre, and Audemars Piguet. Those brands, which have since recovered, are now the bread and butter of today's preowned watch traders.\n\n\"Preowned watches are coming out of drawers so fast and furious now that I've never seen anything like it,\" Govberg said in an interview in the company's headquarters in Bala Cynwyd, just outside Philadelphia. \"It's a real disruption coming to our industry.\"\n\nLuxury brands have taken note. In June, Richemont, the owner of such brands as Cartier and IWC, bought Watchfinder, a British online platform for trading preowned watches.\n\n\"The preowned market has taken some business from the new market, there's no question,\" said Steven Kaiser, a veteran watch industry executive and founder of Kaiser Time, a New York-based luxury industry consulting firm.\n\nGovberg entered the preowned watch business in 1983 when he introduced watches to his family's jewelry store on Jewelers' Row on Philadelphia's Sansom Street.\n\n\"People weren't collecting vintage watches back then,\" he said, recalling that he would travel to Europe to buy used Rolexes and Patek Philippes from watch shows. \"Little shows that you would go to, almost like trading card shows. Like wristwatch swap shows.\"\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, new platforms such as eBay drove Govberg to adopt his own online strategy. Ultimately, he founded WatchBox, a digital platform and app that includes video reviews and a trading market for valuable timepieces. The company recently launched a second season of \"The Classroom,\" a YouTube series that aims to educate watch enthusiasts about the intricacies of owning a watch that could be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nZeron, of Theo&Harris, also uses video to offer his thoughts on the industry. He regularly gets hundreds of thousands of views for his four weekly YouTube posts.\n\n\"Social media is where it took off,\" he said, sitting in his parents' living room with Anna Griffin who was his first employee and a fellow student at Seton Hall University in New Jersey. \"We don't have a retail store \u2014 there was no actual foot traffic. It was all social buzz.\"\n\nThe young entrepreneur, who founded the company with $10,000 in saved up birthday money when he was a college sophomore, has a larger-than-life persona on social media, with a no-holds-barred approach to roasting iconic brands such as Breitling. Some of his viewers comment that he needs to lay off the caffeine or sugar.\n\nThe internet has democratized horological knowledge, much like other niche areas of expertise like aviation.\n\nA watch enthusiast can spend hours on web forums, debating the differences between the various iterations of a $4,500 Tudor Black Bay (\"I love the domed crystal but I'd be interested to see it 1mm thicker,\" says one member on RolexForums.com of the latest \"Fifty-Eight\" release.)\n\nThe explosive growth of preowned watch sales has deeper roots than social media, however. There's an emotional and intellectual appeal to owning a mechanical device that could have three hundred small pieces inside.\n\n\"Nothing that anyone consumes is very interesting anymore,\" said Zeron, sporting a 1980s 18-karat gold Rolex Oyster Perpetual Day-Date.\n\nTake the ubiquitous iPhone \u2014 easily replaceable, Zeron notes.\n\n\"If your vintage Omega breaks, that's it. It's over. You will never get another one like it,\" he said. \"You are going to remember the drinks and the dates and the arguments you had in it. You are going to be sad that you lost it.\"\n\nThen, there is the sheer volume and variety on offer, with supply constantly flowing out of people's drawers.\n\n\"If you went into an IWC boutique, they may have 50, 60, 70, 80 watches to choose from,\" Govberg said. \"But in the preowned space of IWC, you may have 900 watches to choose from.\"\n\nBut the bottom line is that a preowned luxury watch in great condition is usually a third of the price of a new one.\n\n\"For someone that is collecting, for someone that's trying various pieces, is a natural fit,\" said Paul Bragan, a watch collector and senior partner at market research firm Wakefield Research, based in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nBragan spent hours quizzing Zeron online before taking the plunge with his first vintage watch purchase: a 1978 Rolex Datejust, which the Theo&Harris founder personally delivered during a trip to the Washington, D.C., area. It was the start of a friendship, and many more purchases for Bragan.\n\n\"There's a trade-in value proposition with preowned watches much like the car industry,\" said Brack, of NDP.\n\nWatch executives often say their business is like the car industry \u2014 only better.\n\n\"In the car business, you have about 15 years on a car,\" Govberg said. \"Watches are meant to last 100 years.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Amir Bibawy on Twitter @AmirBibawy"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Melanie Curtsinger", "title": "Celebrate 90 Years of Mickey Mouse on Disney Cruise Line", "description": "The biggest birthday celebration on the high seas is coming to Disney Cruise Line next summer, as we celebrate Mickey\u2019s 90th with Mickey and Minnie\u2019s Surprise Party at Sea!", "url": "https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2018/11/celebrate-90-years-of-mickey-mouse-on-disney-cruise-line/", "urlToImage": "https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shlruyupio485.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T15:00:41Z", "content": "The biggest birthday celebration on the high seas is coming to Disney Cruise Line next summer, as we celebrate Mickeys 90th with Mickey and Minnies Surprise Party at Sea!

Rajaonarimampianina on Saturday joined other minority candidates in challenging the results at the High Constitutional Court, the highest court of the country, urging the cancellation of the November 7th ballot, citing voting irregularities.\n\nOnly 54 percent of Madagascar's nearly 10 million registered voters actually cast their ballots, below the first round of the 2013 presidential election where the participation rate was 61 percent.\n\nThe High Constitutional Court has until November 26 to validate the results of the first round."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Dig resurrects a feud over which town is a state's oldest", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

But a few miles up the Connecticut River to the north, Windsor boasts it is the state's \"first town,\" settled in 1633.\n\nThe long-running dispute on which was the first English settlement in Connecticut centers on how you define \"town.\" Settlers from Plymouth, Massachusetts, established a trading post in Windsor in 1633. Advocates for Wethersfield say settlers from Watertown, Massachusetts, made Wethersfield their home in 1634 and claim Windsor didn't become a town until 1635, when people there built homes.\n\n\"I don't think it ever will be settled,\" state archaeologist Brian Jones said.\n\nJones pointed out the Dutch built a fort in Hartford in 1633 that predated the Windsor trading post, and there is some evidence there was a Dutch trading post in Hartford as early as 1623.\n\nArchaeologists at the Wethersfield site say they have uncovered the earliest evidence of European settlement in the state. Among the buried finds: a fence believed to be from the 17th century and built for defense against Native American tribes; coins and ceramics dating to the 1630s; beads used in trade with Native Americans; clothing hooks and buttons; and remains of meals including seafood shells and animal bones.\n\n\"The 17th-century stuff was the most exciting because nobody knew it would be here,\" said Sarah Sportman, senior archaeologist for the nonprofit Public Archaeology Survey Team. \"We have been able to document the lives of the people who live here.\"\n\nThe pro-Windsor camp says the find makes no difference. It points to written records including settlers' diaries and other evidence favoring Windsor.\n\n\"It doesn't change our opinion,\" said Christine Ermenc, executive director of the Windsor Historical Society. \"We maintain that Windsor really is the earliest European settlement. They helped the Native Americans. They helped some of the traders going to Wethersfield.\"\n\nThe nonprofit group will preserve the items for public display and document the artifacts in a report. The survey began two years ago and wrapped up Thursday.\n\nThe dig took place on a small plot behind both the Joseph Webb House, where George Washington and the French general Rochambeau met in 1781 to devise battle plans that led to the end of the Revolutionary War, and the Silas Deane House, named for the Connecticut delegate to the Continental Congress in 1774 and diplomat to France who worked with Benjamin Franklin.\n\nThe plot is the future site of a visitor center for the Webb-Deane-Stevens Museum, which includes the Webb and Deane homes and other locations in the historic section of Wethersfield.

So who did it?\n\nRADDATZ: After Saudi Arabia's shifting explanations about the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the CIA now reportedly concluding Saudi's crown prince himself ordered the killing, according to an explosive new report in The Washington Post.\n\nTRUMP: They haven't assessed anything yet, it's too early. That was a really premature report. But that's possible. We're going to see.\n\nRADDATZ: President Trump pushing back, promising a full report on Tuesday. Who's really responsible? And how far will the U.S. go to hold them accountable?\n\nAnd...\n\nTRUMP: I'm not agitated. It's a hoax. There was no collusion.\n\nRADDATZ: Trump answering Robert Mueller's written questions.\n\nTRUMP: I'm sure they're tricked up, because they like to catch people.\n\nRADDATZ: The president says he'll submit those answers to the special counsel this week. So, is the investigation coming to a close or just heating up? We ask key members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, plus insights and analysis from our powerhouse roundtable.\n\nAnd at least 35 Democratic women preparing to take office for the first time.\n\n\u2018Tell me what it means to you to be part of that group.\u2019\n\nReady to make their mark.\n\nREP.-ELECT DONNA SHALALA (D), FLORIDA: I'm a freshman, but not a rookie.\n\nREP.-ELECT DEB HAALAND (D), NEW MEXICO: It's great being the first. We never want to be the last.\n\nRADDATZ: These women might all belong to the same party, but they're bringing diversity of experience and opinion. How will they shake-up Congress? And with a Republican senate and a Republican president, how will they make their voices heard?\n\nANNOUNCER: From ABC News, it's This Week. Here now co-anchor Martha Raddatz.\n\nRADDATZ: Good morning on this Thanksgiving week. For so many it's a time to take stock of what we're thankful for. But as we head into this holiday, President Trump might have less on his list as storm clouds gather over his presidency. Three we're watching in particular.\n\nThe new class of freshmen Democrats has hit Washington. And with their arrival comes the promise of Democratic-led investigations into the administration. The Russia probe is intensifying. While there's no clear timeline for when Mueller will wrap his investigation, sources tell ABC News the special counsel is in the process of writing his final report. And Trump is facing added pressure as Congress eyes for their action on Saudi Arabia over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, America's relationship with a close ally hanging in the balance.\n\nBut on Saturday, the California wildfires were front and center taking the president west to survey the damage. Parts of that state now barely recognizable, ravaged by the so-called Camp Fire, considered the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California's history.\n\nTrump pledged federal assistance, praised first responders and stood shoulder to shoulder with California Governor Jerry Brown and incoming Governor Gavin Newsom.\n\nOvernight, the death toll from the Camp Fire reached 76 and authorities say there are still nearly 1,300 unaccounted for. Already almost 150,000 acres scorched, nearly 13,000 structures destroyed leaving so many without a home to return to and the fire is only 55 percent contained.\n\nButte County Sheriff Kory Honea has seen this devastation firsthand. And he joins me now.\n\nGood morning, sheriff. Can you give us the latest there from that command post in Chico?\n\nKORY HONEA, BUTTE COUNTY SHERIFF: Good morning, Martha. Thank you for having me.\n\nFrom what I've been told things are going fairly well with the fire in terms of that, but we're expecting some very high wind coming. And that is causing us some concern.\n\nRADDATZ: The number of unaccounted for is so alarming, nearly 1,300. Can you tell us how that list was compiled?\n\nHONEA: Yeah, that list is compiled from a number of sources, people calling in telling us that they have loved ones or friends that they haven't had contact with, people emailing us. And then we're also going back through our record system that was collecting data -- our 911 dispatch -- collecting data during the most intense period of that. So the data that we're putting out is raw. But my thought on that was it's better to work towards progress than achieve perfection before we start getting that information out.\n\nRADDATZ: And with this fire going, how are you verifying who is where?\n\nHONEA: Well, that's a very difficult process. You have thousands and thousands of people who are displaced. And so what we're asking is for the community to -- people to look at that list. If they are on that list to contact our office so that we can be assured that they're safe. If friends or family know where they're at, we'd like that information as well. But it is a daunting task. We are still trying to bring order to the chaos that this entire event has caused.\n\nRADDATZ: Do you have any sense of whether the death toll would be that high -- close to 1,300?\n\nHONEA: I think that it would -- I don't believe that it would be that high. We are still finding people. I think yesterday we were able to account for several hundred people. And as the night went on, I heard about more accounts of people who contact us and advised that they were safe and well.\n\nRADDATZ: And what should people learn from this in terms of accountability in a natural disaster like this. Checking in? What should they do?\n\nHONEA: Yes, that's a great question. And this is an unprecedented event. And in the wake of it, there's so much chaos, there's so many people displaced, but I would ask that people make every diligent effort to reach out to their friends and family and let them know they're OK. And then also, check with us and let us know that they're OK so that we can devote our resources to locating people who haven't yet been accounted for.\n\nRADDATZ: Thanks so much for joining us this morning, Sheriff and thanks to you and all of those who are helping out in those fires.\n\nHONEA: Thank you, Martha.\n\nRADDATZ: Now let's bring in Congressman Adam Schiff of California, the incoming chair of the House Intelligence Committee. Thanks for joining us this morning. And I want to ask you about those fires as well, some very near your district. You saw the president there yesterday. Are you satisfied with his response?\n\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: Well listen, I'm glad that he's there, I'm glad that he is offering federal funds. That's what he should do, that's what a president is expected to do. Of course, I think all Californians were upset with the statements he made earlier in the week when people were facing utter devastation. But we need to focus on putting these fires out, we need to protect ourselves because all too often when the fires are out and rains are coming, then mudslides follow and other tragedy follows, so we -- we need to get through this period and -- and our hearts are going out to those effected and we're so grateful for the responders out there.\n\nRADDATZ: The president has criticized California's forest management -- I think that's one of the things you were talking about there -- as a -- as a reason for the fires. And yesterday saying officials need to look to Finland as an example. Listen to what he said from the site of the fire.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Got to take care of the floors. You know, the floors of the forest. It's very important. You look at other countries where they do it differently and -- and it's a whole different story. I was with the president of Finland and he said we have a much different -- we're a forest nation -- he called it a forest nation and they spend a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things and they don't have any problem.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRADDATZ: Does that make sense to you? What do you think of that answer?\n\nSCHIFF: It doesn't make much sense to me. But the reality is that no single fire has the same cause, every fire is going to be different. The fire in Malibu is different than the -- the Camp Fire. Forest management wasn't going to solve the problem in Malibu. The reality is we're always going to have wildfires in California. With climate change, they're going to be worse. And we need to take steps to reduce their frequency, reduce their severity. And yes, forest management is one piece of it, but there are lots of other pieces.\n\nAnd I think the president needs to listen to the experts because clearly he isn't one of them.\n\nRADDATZ: Thanks for that. I was to turn to Khashoggi. Assassinated. We heard about the Washington Post report with the CIA concluding with high confidence that the Saudi crown prince ordered the killing. You were supposed to receive a briefing on the case this week. What can you tell us about it?\n\nSCHIFF: Well I can't discuss the briefing but I can tell you -- at least in my opinion and given what we know of how the Saudi government operates and the crown prince, a central role in that, it's very difficult for me to conceive of a murder of a prominent journalist and critic being carried out without the crown prince's knowledge. And it is certainly testing the proposition that the enemy of our enemy is our friend. Iran is an enemy, Saudi Arabia is important in pushing back against Iran, that doesn't make Saudi Arabia a friend.\n\nOur friends don't murder journalists. And I think --\n\nRADDATZ: It does not sound like -- from -- from what I've seen, that there is a smoking gun there. So how do you convince the president to -- just hours after this report was out with the CIA, said wait, wait we're not finished with this and said he'd do something Tuesday. What do you expect on Tuesday and -- and the issue of the smoking gun.\n\nSCHIFF: Well I would say this. The president needs to listen to what our intelligence community has to say, what our best professionals' assessment is. And it's vitally important that this administration not allow itself to become part of any Saudi cover-up. Any cover-up, generally, any cover up of the crown prince's involvement.\n\nThe Saudis have already undermined their position in the world, undermined their standing. And the administration makes sure - needs to make sure it doesn't undermine its own standing.\n\nAnd we certainly should be engaged in any discussion about bartering the life of another U.S. resident, Fethullah Gulen, this Turkish cleric that the Turks want to get back. We shouldn't be bartering Mr. Gulen and talking about sending him to Turkey to facilitate a cover-up for the Saudis.\n\nRADDATZ: But - but - but let me stop you there, you have said previously that they - this should be a relationship altering event with Saudi Arabia. But listen to what President Trump said.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: They give us a lot of jobs, they give us a lot of business, a lot of economic development. They are - they have been a truly spectacular ally in terms of jobs and economic development and I also think that, you know, I'm president.\n\nI have to take a lot of things into consideration.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRADDATZ: Does the president have to factor that into his decision making here?\n\nSCHIFF: You know, of all of the reasons to maintain a relationship with Saudi Arabia, I think the number of jobs we derive from Saudi Arabia is at the bottom of the list. Look, Saudi Arabia is an important regional player.\n\nThey're important in terms of pushing back against Iran's malevolence, they have a role to play in the Middle East peace process. They obviously have a role in Syria as well. And we need to figure out how to manage that, but I think what this means more than anything else is, this really needs to alter our relationship.\n\nOn its own right, we should be bringing an end to the war in Yemen, but we - we should also recognize that we do not share the same values-- RADDATZ: --What\u2019s the danger--\n\nSCHIFF: --with Saudi Arabia.\n\nRADDATZ: What's the danger to the U.S. if the relationship is dramatically altered with Saudi?\n\nSCHIFF: Well the - the danger to the U.S. is if the - if we act too precipitously and the House of Saud should fall, that would be completely destabilizing of the region and we don't know what would follow.\n\nSo there are certainly risks here, and we need to figure out how to manage those risks. But first and foremost, we need to bring an end to the conflict in Yemen, but also we need to stop placing so much reliance on Saudi Arabia and in particular on the person of the crown prince.\n\nAny regime that would be involved in murdering a journalist this way we should not be walking hand in hand with.\n\nRADDATZ: And I want to turn to the Mueller investigation. We heard a lot about that this week and possibly there's some sort of decision coming. He appointed Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker, the Justice Department this week defended the move, arguing it's legal under what they call the Vacancies Reform Act and noted that presidents Obama, George Bush both appointed non-Senate confirmed officials to a cabinet office.\n\nWill Democrats still challenge that appointment and are you concerned about him overseeing the Mueller investigation?\n\nSCHIFF: Yes and yes. I think the appointment is unconstitutional. He is clearly a principal officer and the fact that he is a temporary principle officer doesn't mean that that is any less subject to Senate confirmation.\n\nConstitutionally it has to be subject to confirmation. I think they'd lose that court - that case when it goes to the Supreme Court. But it's also in conflict with a more specific statute, and that is there is a succession statute for the Justice Department, which makes the Justice Department different than other agencies which distinguishes it from these other cases that Justice is relying on.\n\nWhen you have a specific statute that says this is the succession plan and doesn't say you can also use the Vacancies Act to avoid the succession plan, you go with the specific statute.\n\nSo it's a flawed appointment, but the - the biggest flaw from my point of view is that he was chosen for the purpose of interfering with the Mueller investigation. He auditioned for the part by going on T.V. and saying he could hobble the investigation.\n\nAnd ethically he should have absolutely nothing to do with the investigation and - and -\n\nRADDATZ: So what will Democrats do about it?\n\nSCHIFF: We will expose any involvement he has in it. He needs to know that if he takes any action to curb what Mr. Mueller does, we're going to find out about it. We're going to expose it. And I would certainly call on my colleagues right now to avoid the constitutional crisis, take action now, speak out against this appointment.\n\nYou can imagine that if a Democratic president whose administration was effectively under investigation appointed someone as attorney general who had expressed hostility to that investigation, talked about crippling it, the hue and cry, and they would be right.\n\nAnd we are right to raise this. This is attack on the rule of law, and the question for my GOP colleagues is will they have the same devotion to rule of law and institution that their predecessors during Watergate had?\n\nBecause that's what's called for right now.\n\nRADDATZ: OK, thanks very much, Congressman Schiff. It's always good to see you.\n\nLet's turn to Senator Roy Blunt, a member of the Republican leadership who also serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee. And I want to turn back to Khashoggi first. You heard Congressman Schiff there saying what he thinks should happen. Assuming the reports are accurate about the CIA conclusion, should the president issue sanctions on the crown prince?\n\nROY BLUNT, SENATOR (R-MO): Well, like Adam, we did have a briefing this week. I can't really talk about that briefing but I do think that it won't hurt here for another few days to pass. The president says he's going to have some conclusions by Tuesday on this. Certainly the way you look at Saudi Arabia and the way it runs, it's hard to imagine something like this could happen without the crown prince knowing. But I don't know that we absolutely know that yet. And...\n\nRADDATZ: Just from - just from reading the reports in the Washington Post, look, we've heard about phone calls that were intercepted. I know you can't talk about things like this. We've heard phone calls intercepted between the prince and his brother. We've heard about tapes inside of the Saudi Consulate in Turkey. What more is needed? The same question that I asked Congressman Schiff. There's - there doesn't appear to be a smoking gun but there's a lot of evidence piling up.\n\nBLUNT: Well, I think a smoking gun would certainly help. If you actually did have that specific thing that is unlikely to be out there or unlikely to be found where someone gave a specific direction and you know that happened, I also agree that the economy is not a reason to worry about this relationship. Balance in the Middle East is. Who's going to be in control there is. I'm certainly in favor of what we've tried to do with Russia and other countries under the Magnitsky Act of barring people from coming to the country, having economic impact. We'll just have - I think we'll have to see in the next few days whether we can really make the case that the crown prince would be one of those people or not.\n\nRADDATZ: So if the president comes out on Tuesday, you know what you know and he says we can't prove anything. What would your reaction be?\n\nBLUNT: Well, I do know what I know and let's see what the president says on Tuesday. I think the high confidence doesn't mean that you actually have what you need, if that's the term that the CIA is using. I'm not talking about what we heard this week but just what we all could read...\n\nRADDATZ: In the public domain, yes.\n\nBLUNT: ... In the paper this morning. That is - if that is accurate, it means that we don't quite have all the information we'd like to have yet. It would be nice - if we're going to deal with this relationship which does really impact the balance of power in the Middle East, it does really impact how we'd - who - the balance to Iran, which is clearly a bad actor. We need to be absolutely sure we know exactly what we're talking about and not what the first step is but also what the second and third step that that first step would lead you to, really determines.\n\nRADDATZ: There's been some question about what the president knew and when on the crown prince's role in Khashoggi's death. But take a look at this tweet from President Obama's deputy national security advisor, Ben Rhodes. \"We are faced with the real possibility that Trump has had info from his own intel community that MBS,\" Mohammad Bin Salman, \"was responsible for murdering a journalist who wrote for the Washington Post, and lied about it. I tried to help - and tried to help MBS get past it. Must be investigated.\"\n\nDo you think he knew something before in that Khashoggi should have been warned, or the intelligence community?\n\nBLUNT: Well, I don't know the specific answer there but I do know that I'm likely to know more about that than Ben Rhodes and I think that's just pretty wild speculation.\n\nRADDATZ: Are you concerned that the president has ignored the intelligence in order to protect the relationship?\n\nBLUNT: No.\n\nRADDATZ: Not at all?\n\nBLUNT: No.\n\nRADDATZ: I want to move also to what Congressman Schiff said about the Mueller investigation and about Whitaker. President Trump weighed in on Twitter this week, \"the inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with answers they want.\" They've gone absolutely nuts? Have you seen any evidence of that? Do you know what the president's talking about?\n\nBLUNT: I don't know what the president's talking about but I do know that that's not news that the president would have this view of the Mueller investigation. He has engaged in this in that way from the very start, just like virtually every member of the Senate. And I think most members of the House have engaged, saying \"Mr. President, it would be a huge mistake not to let the Mueller investigation come to a conclusion. We need to get beyond this, we don't need to start - have this starting again.\"\n\nRADDATZ: So you have confidence in the Mueller investigation?\n\nBLUNT: I do. I do.\n\nRADDATZ: And let's talk about the acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. Lindsey Graham just said on another program this morning, I don't know if he's the best choice. What do you think about that?\n\nBLUNT: Well, what we need is a permanent attorney general. We need to move as quickly as we can beyond whoever is the acting attorney general to an attorney general that's going to be there for, hopefully, a much longer period of time. So we'll see.\n\nI don't know Matt Whitaker well. I've known him for some time, met him in Iowa years ago when he was U.S. Attorney. On the occasions I've had with him to be -- he's been very responsive and has seen that the Justice Department responded to the things I've asked about. So in terms of an acting capacity, he does not -- he seems to be a person that has the ability to do that acting job and ...\n\nRADDATZ: But not a permanent position; is that what you're saying?\n\nBLUNT: Well, I would think -- I -- I would think not. But that's -- the president needs to determine who's going to be permanently at the Justice Department as soon as he can. Now, you know and I know that one of ...\n\nRADDATZ: What are you looking for?\n\nBLUNT: ... one of our big challenges in this generally has been that our friends on the other side in the Senate have made it so hard to get anybody confirmed to anything. And so, you know, the president's unlikely, I think, to make that nomination before the Congress reconvenes and, if he did, we'd be unlikely to be able to do anything with it. We are way beyond the time where you have a hearing and a week later somebody gets confirmed to these jobs, no matter how insignificant they are. And this one, of course, is very significant.\n\nRADDATZ: Just -- just tell me what you're looking for in an attorney general, if not Matt Whitaker.\n\nBLUNT: Well, I think what the president should be looking for in an attorney general is someone who can manage the Justice Department, who understands the far-ranging impact of that Department, hopefully has had some experience working with or in the Department before that, and ...\n\nRADDATZ: And as for the Mueller investigation?\n\nBLUNT: ... As for the Mueller investigation, I -- I think the Mueller investigation is going forward. I ...\n\nRADDATZ: In terms of an attorney general.\n\nBLUNT: ... Well, in terms of an attorney general, you know, the -- the big question here on the Mueller investigation, I think, is whether the Congress has any ability to tell the president who can work in the executive branch. That's a Constitutional question, it's -- it's different than the question of whether Mueller should be allowed to continue, it's what could you do about that.\n\nYou know, this idea that we'd have a debate, and have a vote and put a bill on the president's desk that he wouldn't sign. I don't think that's nearly as impactful as members continuing to say, Mr. President, we need to get beyond this; you need to let this come to a conclusion. And I think -- I don't have any reason to believe that Matt Whitaker feels differently than that.\n\nRADDATZ: OK. Thanks very much for joining us this morning, Senator Blunt.\n\nBLUNT: You bet.\n\nRADDATZ: Up next, the midterms delivered a wave of women set to join Congress next year. So how will they change Washington? We sat down with a group of new members this week to find out. And later, Chris Christie and our powerhouse roundtable discuss the president's latest attacks on the Mueller investigation. We'll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA: I have overwhelming support in my caucus to be Speaker of the House and certainly we have many, many people in our caucus who could serve in this capacity. I happen to think that at this point I'm the best person for that.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do you think of Marcia Fudge trying to challenge you or considering challenging you.\n\nPELOSI: Say it to everybody, come on in, the water's warm.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRADDATZ: The water may be warm, but Nancy Pelosi says she's confident she'll be the next Speaker of the House. Her fate may very well be decided by the newest representatives on Capitol Hill, including that surge of woman coming to Congress, bringing the female House ranks from 84 right now up to more than 100 for the first time. To get a sense of what these new members bring to Washington, we spoke with five incoming Democratic Congresswomen with unique backgrounds.\n\nAn Air Force veteran, a former CIA officer, one of the first Native American women in Congress, the youngest African American woman ever elected and a former cabinet secretary. I started by asking them what it means for so many women to be joining the ranks of Congress.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nCHRISSY HOULAHAN (D), PENNSYLVANIA: It's a remarkable privilege to be part of this group and it really is an important step for Congress to more represent -- better represent the face of the nation. And as you can see from our faces, I think we're a better representation of what's been missing in Congress.\n\nRADDATZ: Abigail, what do women bring to Congress?\n\nABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D), VIRGINIA: I was a former CIA officer, we've got an engineer, we've got a bevy of experience here. And I think part of who I am, part of how I view the world is informed by the fact that I'm a woman, that I'm a mother, that I'm a sister and a daughter and wife. And I think in everything that I'm looking at and in every topic I'm considering, that perspective is a valuable one.\n\nDEB HAALAND (D), NEW MEXICO: The other day I was walking across the Capitol to go take our freshman photograph and two young Native girls from South Dakota ran up behind me and tapped me on the shoulder and their mother came over and they were all crying. Like, all of us were crying. And --\n\nRADDATZ: To have a Native American on the Hill.\n\nHAALAND: Yes, yes, for us, for a group of folks in our country who have been here for thousands of years and being so underrepresented in Congress, I think it means a tremendous amount to folks in those communities\n\nRADDATZ: And Lauren, part of the diversity is age.\n\nUNDERWOOD: Yes.\n\nYou are the youngest African-American member of the House...\n\nUNDERWOOD: Ever.\n\nRADDATZ: Ever\n\nUNDERWOOD: Ever\n\nOur voices have not been heard in the halls of the Congress for too long. And so now we have not just one vote at the table, we have a caucus. We have a true Millennial caucus now in the House of Representatives. And I think that that is a significant step forward and opportunity for progress.\n\nRADDATZ: Do you think you view things differently?\n\nUNDERWOOD: I think my approach to problem solving, the process with which we make decisions can be more transparent, can be more open, can be more inclusive. Even this week, our use of social media, taking a peek behind the veil of what the Congress is actually like.\n\nRADDATZ: And Donna, you're a newcomer as well to Congress but not a newcomer to Washington.\n\nSHALALA: That's true. I'm a freshman but not a rookie.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSHALALA: And it's been pretty exciting. People in the halls that work here say welcome back, because they remember when I was here as a Cabinet officer.\n\nBut I also think this is a revolution.\n\nRADDATZ; And I know you're all optimistic. But be realistic here, there's still a Republican Senate, a Republican president. How do you really make progress?\n\nHAALAND: Why not start with an issue or with folks and something that you can agree on? And so I almost feel like we need to find what those things are, what can we agree on. Let's make some friends. Let's reach out. In the end it matters that we are representing our districts in the right way and they expect us to come here and do some work and not just start fights\n\nUNDERWOOD: Well, as Deb mentioned there is an agenda that we all agree on, but in the 115th Congress they wouldn't call a floor vote. One of the prime examples in my mind is paid family leave. Donald Trump campaigned on -- he deputized his daughter, Ivanka, to go and be a shepherd in the Congress and she couldn't get it done because they wouldn't call a floor vote. And so when I think about opportunities for bipartisan action there are many opportunities that now we have a House that's willing to call a vote that creates the foundation with which we can build upon.\n\nSHALALA: We just went through hard elections.\n\nUNDERWOOD: That\u2019s right.\n\nSHALALA: We flipped the House, and we\u2019re tough enough and strong enough and focused enough, I think, to get some things done. In my case, I want to work on health care. That affects everybody. We won our election very much with health care as one of the major issues. And you can't ignore that.\n\nRADDATZ: Is that, to you, the one thing that Democrats have to-- have to make happen before 2020?\n\nSHALALA: Absolutely.\n\nUNDERWOOD: Absolutely.\n\nHOULAHAN: It is the issue of my district.\n\nRADDATZ: Is investigating President Trump and his administration a priority for you?\n\nSHALALA: Of course we want to hold this administration accountable, but at the same time we need to deal with the health issues, we need to deal with the environmental issues.\n\nRADDATZ: Do you worry that any of your Democratic colleagues might overplay the hand on investigating Trump?\n\nHOULAHAN: I actually worry that the, frankly the media is overplaying that. There is a time and a place for the oversight that needs to happen, but I think it's really important that the narrative of our, of our Congress is about what we're getting done for the people.\n\nRADDATZ: How do you deliver -- you've seen the Democrats in the party -- there is more traditional, there's a progressive -- how do you square those and have a Democratic message going into 2020?\n\nUNDERWOOD: I think that there's always going to be a spectrum. We are a big tent party. But when we step onto the floor of the house and cast votes and when we lead, we have to carry forward the voices for the people back home. And so we cannot fall down these rabbit holes about \u2018what kind of Democrat are you?\u2019\n\nRADDATZ: OK, let me go down the row and ask you all the same question. Are you planning to vote for Nancy Pelosi?\n\nSHALALA: I am.\n\nUNDERWOOD: I have not made up my mind.\n\nHAALAND: Yes, I am.\n\nSPANBERGER: No I'm not.\n\nHOULAHAN: I haven't made up my mind\n\nRADDATZ: What will help you make up your mind? Her staff, everyone will say look she helped get you all elected.\n\nHOULAHAN: No, I have enormous respect for Leader Pelosi. But I do want to make sure that I understand to the degree that I can what kind of reform can happen in the, in the floor so that young voices and new voices can be heard.\n\nRADDATZ: And Abigail, you've been pretty firm on this all along that you would not vote for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker. Why not?\n\nSPANBERGER: I think that we -- if we are going to turn a page and bring civility back to the political discussions we need to change the people who are directing that conversation. And I, like Chrissy said, I have tremendous respect for everything that Leader Pelosi has done. I think we're all sitting here in part because of the-- the path that she has blazed for us. But I have been very, very clear and honest about my intentions.\n\nHAALAND: She's the only person, I believe, that we need in this tumultuous time with the president we have to stay on track, to make sure that we are fulfilling the promises to the American people.\n\nRADDATZ: Donna, what would you say to Abigail about Nancy Pelosi and who -- who worries about the civility?\n\nSHALALA: I would look at what the job is and it's a little bit of herding cats and it's a little bit about keeping a Democratic Party that's full of lots of different points of view.\n\nAnd I think that Nancy has demonstrated that time and time again, she has a backbone. She'll stand up to a president. You know, this is not forever. But right now at this time in this transition for the next two years, I'm with her.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRADDATZ: And we'll have to wait and see what happens, our thanks to them for that conversation. Welcome to Washington. The Roundtable is up next. We'll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: I will tell you I'm extremely upbeat. The White House is running like a well-oiled machine. It's doing really well. I have great people. I will make some changes, but not very many.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRADDATZ: President Trump says he's upbeat but will Democrats coming to Washington change his outlook? The roundtable's all here to debate that and more. We'll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nRADDATZ: And there you have it, the freshman class for the incoming 116th Congress. As you saw earlier from our conversation on the Hill, a record number of women were elected to the House and all but one of them are Democrats. Our colleagues at FiveThirtyEight note that just 15 percent of the women in the next Congress will be Republicans, down from 27 percent currently serving. We're going to talk about that and much more with our roundtable.\n\nFormer New Jersey governor and ABC News contributor Chris Christie, Democratic strategist and ABC News contributor Stephanie Cutter, Reihan Salam, executive editor of National Review and author of the new book \"Melting Pot or Civil War?: A Son of Immigrants Makes the Case Against Open Borders\" and Mary Jordan, national correspondent for the Washington Post.\n\nWelcome, everybody. And I'm going to start with you, Mary Jordan. You saw that class picture of the incoming number of women, you heard all the women I talked to. Do you think they really make a difference?\n\nMARY JORDAN, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON POST: I do think that in all the excitement and the significant gains we've been talking about, three out of four members of Congress are still men. And we are still way behind most of the rest of the world. So I think first of all, men are still in charge here, but there is an enormous amount of new energy to get things done. A lot of women who were never in politics are coming to the Hill. And I think they're going to bring fresh perspective and they're going to focus on two things.\n\nI heard over and over and over that they're going to focus on healthcare and stopping the kind of incivility and trying to heal things. And if they do that, that would be a pretty significant change in conversation on Capitol Hill.\n\nRADDATZ: And everybody comes in with a great agenda. We'll hope they keep their -- we'll hope they keep their energy up. And Chris Christie, to that point about women, Congress's newest members were up on Capitol Hill, as we just saw.\n\nCHRISTIE: Yeah.\n\nRADDATZ: Let\u2019s just take a look at the Republican freshman class in the House, I guess, you know, to rub it in.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nOK, look at the faces there. And here is just some of the Democratic freshman class. Little bit different. Should that lack of racial and gender diversity be cause for concern among Republicans, especially when you look at the midterms?\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, listen, I think that we should always be looking for ways to make our party more diverse and more representative of what the country looks like. So I think that should be a goal. You know, I come from the most ethnically diverse state in America. And so for me, you know, the fact that my party \u2013 let\u2019s say in New Jersey, look significantly different than that class picture, just tells you it\u2019s possible to do that.\n\nRADDATZ: OK, but we\u2019re not just talking about New Jersey. We just had the midterms\u2026\n\nCHRISTIE: No, but I\u2019m saying\u2026\n\nRADDATZ: \u2026 But what do they need to do?\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, I think you got to focus on it, you got to recruit. I mean, candidates \u2013 like you said, a lot of these folks who came in on the Democratic side had never been involved in politics before. How did they get there? Well, some of them were self-motivated to get there but some of them, Martha, were recruited. And I think it\u2019s incumbent upon the leadership of the party to go out and recruit members of our country, citizens of our country, who believe in Republican philosophies and Republican approaches to government, and get them to come in to give our party an even more diverse look at what is going on and how we solve some of the problems the country has.\n\nRADDATZ: And speaking of those problems, Stephanie, it \u2013 the midterms went for the Democrats from good to really very good, or you might even say great. But you still have a Republican Senate, you still have a Republican in the White House. So what happens in the next two years? How do you bridge that divide?\n\nCUTTER: Well, I think that Democrats have two roads. One is to get things done that matter to people. You know, I was struck by the women that you just interviewed and talking about paid leave, that the current House of Representatives wouldn\u2019t even bring it to a vote. I guarantee you, under Democratic leadership, that will be brought to a vote. And that will matter to people to see their Congress voting on something that impacts their daily life.\n\nThe second thing is, I think that this House will be an important check on the president\u2019s power. And that\u2019s a necessary part of our democracy. You know, whether it\u2019s the abuse of power through cabinet agencies or the president making executive rulemakings without the proper process, or dividing and demonizing certain segments of our society, those are the types of things that I think this House of Representatives and, I think, one of the reasons they were elected, is to make sure that that abuse of power, there\u2019s some sort of a check on it.\n\nThat\u2019s the checks and balances that are instilled in our government.\n\nRADDATZ: OK, on this side of the table, we have our partisans today. On this side of the table, Reihan, I\u2019m going to go to you. President Trump called the Senate results an epic victory. You wrote this week, however, you see troubling signs for the Republicans.\n\nSALAM: That\u2019s right. The main sign is that the Republican Party is eroding among suburban upper and middle-income, college-educated voters, and yet the party was not growing among working class voters. Those voters were enormously important in 2016. They helped propel the president to victory. However, he has the support of some white working-class voters. He seems to have lost some of that support and he has not built support among working-class voters who are not white.\n\nAnd when you think about the party\u2019s long-term trajectory, yes, the Democratic caucus is now very diverse but its voter base has become a lot more suburban, a lot more affluent, and that, in theory, creates an opportunity for Republicans to appeal to a broader swath of the working class. But to really do that, you need not just cultural politics. You need something a little more substantive as well on economic and domestic policy. And that\u2019s what we haven\u2019t seen so far from the president, even though he seems to have those instincts.\n\nRight before the election, he said \u201cHey, we needed a middle-class tax cut. I\u2019m going to give you one right before the midterms.\u201d That, of course, didn\u2019t happen. But he realizes, he appreciates, that running against the safety net, running on a very narrow, small government agenda that doesn\u2019t necessarily speak to working class voters, he didn\u2019t do that in 2016 but he didn\u2019t follow through on that more populist--\n\nRADDATZ: And Mary, you\u2019re out there with the voters as a reporter.\n\nJORDAN: You know, Donald Trump got an enormous amount of traction by talking about, I\u2019m going to take care of the forgotten man and women. And when I\u2019m talking to people out there, many of these people who believed him and voted for him, they still feel forgotten. And so especially for people, you know, yes that there\u2019s a little \u2013 there\u2019s a bump in the economy, but I think people don\u2019t feel that they got what they wanted from Donald Trump. And 2020 is all going to be about that.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be about, who is going to help the middle-class people and low \u2013 because we think \u2013 that there\u2019s a feeling that rich people, they\u2019re doing just fine. And again, 2020 is going to be about the middle class.\n\nRADDATZ: And Stephanie, I want to go to you, and speaking of 2020, let\u2019s take a look at Florida, what happened. Andrew Gillum has now conceded in the governor\u2019s race. It doesn\u2019t look like the Democrats will hold the Senate. I think the final recount is -- is today. Looking into 2020, can Democrats win back the White House without Florida, without Ohio which was also very red?\n\nCUTTER: They can. It\u2019s very difficult but there are pathways. Florida is the ultimate battleground for both Democrats and Republicans. And it\u2019s, you know, the -- you see it switching back and forth every two years between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nWe\u2019ve got a lot of work to do there. Obviously, it\u2019s a recount so it is a very, very close race. But we need to look very carefully, what are the lessons that we can learn? How can we better organize? What -- what went wrong? There\u2019s no reason why Bill Nelson shouldn\u2019t be winning handily in that Senate race.\n\nBut, you know, we were also fortunate to expand our playing ground when -- with bringing Arizona into the Democratic column, which opens up new opportunities to get to 270 electoral votes in a -- in a presidential election. But I guess I would say, while we had great results a little over a week ago, almost two weeks ago, looking at the lessons learned from 2018 and how they apply to 2020, we have a tremendous amount of work to do.\n\nRADDATZ: And -- and -- and Chris, I wanted to ask you, another race getting a lot of attention is the Senate race in Mississippi. The president just announced he\u2019ll be heading there to campaign on the behalf of Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith who\u2019s in a runoff election with Democrat Mike Espy. It seemed like it should be an easy win for the Republicans until this happened.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. CINDY HYDE-SMITH, R-Miss.: If he invited me to public hanging, I\u2019d be on the front row.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRADDATZ: \u201cIf he invited me to a public hanging, I\u2019d be on the front row.\u201d she\u2019s saying to a supporter there. How concerned are you about the race?\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, I think we have to be concerned when candidates say stupid things, right? So I mean, I remember when I was chairman of the RGA, the Republican Governors Association, in 2014 and we had got off a bunch of races. You\u2019ll remember, in 2012 where Republican candidates had talked about rape in a way that was completely inappropriate. One of the things I said to the new gubernatorial candidates in \u201814 was if anybody says the word \u2018rape,\u2019 I\u2019m not going to fund your races.\n\nI mean, candidates matter. And so now this race will be much more watched. I think the Republican will still win but I think it\u2019ll be much more watched because when candidates say things that, you know, aren\u2019t -- aren\u2019t right, aren\u2019t smart, they get more attention.\n\nBut I\u2019d say one other thing, Martha, to what you were saying before about 2020. You know, the president and every president goes through this -- President Obama went through it, President Clinton, President Bush 43 -- when you go through a midterm and the results aren\u2019t exactly what you would have hoped or worse, it\u2019s a time for re-examination, re-examination of how you\u2019re going to present yourself and, I think, even more so for this president now because he has a Democratic House he has to deal with. And so he\u2019s going to have to decide, does he want to be the New York dealmaker, which is part of the way he ran, or does he want to be a doctrinaire Republican.\n\nAnd I think that, Reihan, what you\u2019re saying is absolutely right. He has an opportunity to grow the Republican base in a way that\u2019s going to play into the map Stephanie spoke about but it\u2019s his decision, he\u2019s got to decide how do to do it.\n\nJORDAN: But isn\u2019t -- isn\u2019t the red alert here that the Republicans can\u2019t get women to vote for them? What the (ph) \u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, that\u2019s not true though, Mary. It\u2019s not \u2026\n\nJORDAN: \u2026 the exit polls show a profound gender gap that we have never even seen that women \u2026\n\nCHRISTIE: \u2026 But Mary, there\u2019s always been a gender gap. I -- I don\u2019t -- I \u2026\n\nJORDAN: \u2026 No, no, not like this.\n\nCUTTER: Not like this\n\nJORDAN: This is a record.\n\nCHRISTIE: \u2026 Listen, listen -- right. And this -- and -- and -- and this was a bigger gap in a midterm election. So let\u2019s see what happens in a presidential year election when an even number of people turn out to vote. You always should be concerned about who\u2019s not voting for you because you want them to vote for you -- whether it\u2019s gender-based, ethnicity-based, whether it\u2019s regional as you were talking about before as we see great regional differences, or whether it\u2019s based upon educational background and affluence -- you should be concerned about all that because you want every vote you can get. That\u2019s the way you win.\n\nCUTTER: So at this point in 2010 -- and I\u2019ll be quick, Martha -- the -- the pundits gave President Obama a 17 percent chance of winning re-election. And we sat down and figured out what -- what do we need to do to change.\n\nCHRISTIE: Yeah.\n\nCUTTER: And we decided we need to expand that group that we were talking to, not just our base but those that we needed to persuade that we were on a pathway to a better future. Compare that to President Trump threatening to shut down the government this week over his border wall and using the caravan as a message to divide us \u2026\n\nCHRISTIE: But I would also \u2026\n\nCUTTER: \u2026 Is he learning that lesson?\n\nCHRISTIE: \u2026 Well, I don't know but I -- I -- I\u2019m pretty confident, as I recall 2010, that President Obama\u2019s epiphany didn\u2019t happen within 12 days of the midterm. He sat down with advisors like you and others over a period of weeks and said, OK, here are the numbers. Here\u2019s what we have to do.\n\nCUTTER: But you know what -- what he wasn\u2019t doing?\n\nCHRISTIE: Well--\n\nCUTTER: He wasn\u2019t threatening to shut down the government \u2026\n\nCHRISTIE: But \u2026\n\nCUTTER: \u2026 over an incredibly divisive issue that has already divided the country over the past two years.\n\nRADDATZ: The partisans are on this side of the table.\n\nI'm going to launch back over to this side of the table with our journalists over here. And Reihan, I know we want to launch ahead to 2020 but what about the next two years? What do you see happening in the White House? We heard a lot about, once again, staff shake-ups. We see President Trump who appears to be getting a little, a little unsettled about all this. What are you seeing in terms of the Trump White House now and where he goes in the next two years?\n\nSALAM: Well, one really important thing to keep in mind is that Donald Trump presented himself as a very independent figure, a figure who was quite different and distinct from conventional mainstream Republicans, that was a big part of his appeal. Now, when you had House Speaker Paul Ryan, a man who has many virtues, of course, but someone who was dedicated to an agenda that dated back to the '90s, that's something that really did wind up constraining President Trump.\n\nThe fact that President Trump on more than one occasion has said he's willing to find Republican votes to back Speaker Pelosi -- now you can say that's just being playful -- but also he is someone who has repeatedly said I want to talk about infrastructure. I want to talk about middle class tax cuts. You know, his daughter, Ivanka, as a previous congresswoman-elect mentioned, was talking about paid leave and what have you.\n\nIt's quite possible that he is going to try to triangulate. Now whether or not he can succeed in doing that, given the fact that people have very strong opinions about him one way or another, is an open question. But clearly the president himself wants to shake the kaleidoscope of American politics and do something a bit different between now and 2020.\n\nRADDATZ: You've got 10 seconds.\n\nJORDAN: He's got to -- when he ran before, he didn't have a record. Now he has a record and people are going to say where's the infrastructure? Where is the help for the middle class? And all of us voted for you, what are you giving to us? I think that he's got a much higher bar now in 2020 and he's losing women by the droves. And they vote more often than men.\n\nRADDATZ: Very good on the 10 seconds.\n\nThanks to all of you. We'll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nRADDATZ: And that's all for us today. Thanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us. Check out World News Tonight and have a great Thanksgiving.\n\nEND"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Butte County sheriff on status of California's Camp Fire", "description": "Sheriff Kory Honea of Butte County, Calif. is interviewed on \"This Week\" about the status of the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state's history.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/butte-county-sheriff-status-californias-camp-fire-59277642", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/ThisWeek/181118_tw_kory_honea_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T14:49:36Z", "content": "Now Playing: Sierra fire scorches more than 100 acres in San Bernardino County Now Playing: New concerns camp fire death toll will keep climbing Now Playing: Number of missing in California fire skyrockets Now Playing: Butte County sheriff on status of Califo\u2026 [+1205 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Butte County sheriff: 'Still trying to bring order to the chaos' caused by Camp Fire\n\nJamal khashoggi. Wildfires were front and center taking the president west to survey the damage. Parts of that state barely recognizable. Ravaged by the so-called camp fire, considered the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California's history. Trump pledged federal assistance, praised first responders and stood shoulder to shoulder with Jerry brown and incoming governor Gavin Newsom. Overnight the death toll from the camp fire reached 76 and authorities say there are still nearly 1,300 unaccounted for. Already almost 150,000 acres scorched. Nearly 13,000 structures destroyed leaving so many without a home to return to and the fire is only 55% contained. Sheriff Korey Honea has seen the devastation firsthand. Good morning, sheriff. Can you give us the latest from that command post in chico? Good morning, Martha. Thank you for having me. What we've I've been told things are going fairly well in terms of the fire. We're expecting high winds coming. That is causing us some concern. The number of unaccounted for is so alarming. Nearly 1,300. Can you tell us how that list was compiled? That list is compiled from a number of sources, people calling in telling us they have loved ones or friends they haven't had contact with, people emailing us. We're going back through our record system that was collecting data during the most intense period of that. So the data that we're putting out is raw. My thought on that was it's better to work toward progress than achieve perfection before we started getting that information out. With the fire going, how are you verifying who is where? That's a very difficult process. You have thousands of people displaced. We're asking for the community and people to look at that list. If they're on that list, contact our office so we can be sure they're safe. If friends and family know where they're at, we would like that information as well. It's a daunting task. We're trying to bring order to the chaos. Do you have any sense whether the death toll would be that high, close to 1,300? I think it would -- I don't believe it would be that high. We are still finding people. I think yesterday we were able to account for several hundred people. As the night went on, I heard about more accounts of people that contacted us and advised they were safe and well. What should people learn from this in terms of accountability in a natural disaster like this? Checking in, what should they do? That's a great question. This is an unprecedented event. In the wake of it there was so much chaos and so many people displaced. I would ask that people make every effort to reach out to their friends and family and let them know they're okay. Check with us and let us know they're okay so we can devote our resources to locating people who haven't been accounted for. Thanks so much for joining us, sheriff. Thanks to you and all of those helping out in those fires. Thank you, Martha.

Nelson's lawyers had hoped that more than 26,000 under-votes in Broward County -- ballots on which voters marked choices for other races, but not for Senate -- would yield extra votes to help the Democrat. But with hand recounting complete in Broward on Friday, Scott's campaign said this weekend that it had obtained results through public-records request, and Broward's recounting had netted Nelson fewer than 300 votes against his opponent.\n\nThe Senate recount had been subject to at least a dozen lawsuits, some challenging deadlines and which votes should be counted.\n\nThe Florida races have been subject to multiple allegations of fraud by Republicans -- including Scott and President Donald Trump, who tweeted that ballots had been \"infected\" and suggested without evidence that votes had materialized out of thin air and that voters often disguise themselves and vote twice."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: 1-on-1 with Rep.

Thanks for joining us this morning. I want to ask you about those fires as well. Some are very near your district. You saw the president there yesterday. Are you satisfied with his response? Listen, I'm glad he's there. I'm glad he's offering federal funds. That's what he should do. That's what a president is expected to do. I think all californians were upset with the statements he made in the beginning of the week when people were facing utter devastation. We need to focus on putting these fires out. We need to protect ourselves. All too often when the fires are out and rains are coming mudslides follow and other tragedy follows. We need to get through this period. Our hearts are going out to those affected. We're so grateful for the responders out there. The president criticized California's forest management I think that's one of the things you were talking about there, as a reason for the fires. Yesterday saying officials need to look to Finland as an example. Listen to what he said from the site of the fire. Take care of the floors, the floors of the forest. It's very important. You look at other countries where they do it differently and it's a whole different story. I was with the president of Finland. He said we have a much different -- we're a forest nation. He called it a forest nation. They spend a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things. They don't have any problem. Does that make sense to you? What do you think of that answer? It doesn't make sense to me. The reality is no single fire has the same cause. Every fire is going to be different. The fire in malibu is different than the camp fire. Forest management wasn't going to solve the problem in malibu. The reality is we're always going to have wildfires in California. With climate change they're going to be worse. We need to take steps to reduce their frequency and the severity. Forest management is one piece of it. There's lots of other pieces. The president needs to listen to the experts because clearly he isn't one of them. Thanks for that. I want to turn to khashoggi. Assassinated. We heard about the \"Washington post\" report with the CIA concluding with high confidence that the Saudi high prince ordered the killing. You were supposed to receive a briefing on the case. What can you tell us about it? I can't discuss the briefing. I can tell you, at least my opinion and given how we know the Saudi government operates and the crown prince's essential role in that, it's difficult for me to perceive of a murder of a prominent journalist and critic being carried out without the crown prince's knowledge. It's testing the proposition that the enemy of our enemy is our friend. Iran is an enemy. Saudi Arabia is important in pushing back against Iran. That doesn't make Saudi Arabia our friend. Our friends don't murder journalists. I think -- It doesn't sound like from what I've seen that there is a smoking gun there. How do you convince a president to just hours after this report was out with the CIA who said wait, we're not finished with this and said he'll do something Tuesday. What do you expect on Tuesday and the issue of the smoking gun? The president needs to listen to what our intelligence community has to say, what our professionals' bes is. It's important this administration not allow itself to become a part of any Saudi cover up. Any cover up generally, any cover up of the count prince's involvement. The Saudis have already undermined there position in the world, undermined their standing. The administration needs to make sure it doesn't undermine its own standing. We should be engaged about bartering the life of another U.S. Resident, the Turkish cleric that the Turks want to give back. We shouldn't be bartering to cover up for the Saudis. Listen to what president trump said. They give us a lot of jobs. They give us a lot of business, a lot of economic development. They are -- they have been a truly spectacular ally in terms of jobs and economic development. I also take that -- you know I'm president. I have to take a lot of things into consideration. Does the president have to factor that into his decision making here? Of all of the reasons to maintain a relationship with Saudi Arabia, the number of jobs we derive from Saudi Arabia is at the bottom of the list. They're an important regional player. They're important for pushing back against Iran. They have a role in the middle East peace process. They have a role in Syria as well. We need to figure out how to manage that. What this means more than anything else, it really needs to alter our relationship. On its own right we should be bringing a stop to the war in Yemen. We should also recognize we do not share the same values as Saudi Arabia. What's the danger to the U.S. If the relationship is dramatically altered? The danger to the U.S. Is if we act too precipitously and the house should fall, that would be destabilizing of the region and we don't know what would follow. There are certainly risks here. We need to figure out how to manage those risks. First and foremost we need to bring an end to the conflict in Yemen. Also we need to stop placing so much reliance on Saudi Arabia and in particular on the crown prince. Any regime that would be involved in murdering a journalist this way we should not be walking hand in hand with. I want to talk about the Mueller investigation. We heard a lot about that this week. Possibly there's a decision coming. He appointed acting attorney general Matt Whitaker, the justice department defended the move arguing it's legal under the vacancies reform act and noted that P presidents Obama and bush both appointed nonsenate confirmed officials to cabinet offices. Will Democrats still challenge that appointment? Are you concerned about him overseeing the Mueller investigation? Yes and yes. I think the appointment is unconstitutional. Constitutionally it has to be subject to confirmation. I think they lose that case when it goes to the supreme court. It's also in conflict with a more specific statute. There's a succession statute for the justice department which makes the justice department different from other agencies. Which distinguishes this from other cases that justice is rely upon. It doesn't say you can use the vacancy's act to avoid the success plan. It's a flawed appointment. The biggest flaw is he was chosen for the purpose of interfering with the Mueller investigation. He auditioned for the part by saying he could hobble the investigation. Ethically he should have nothing to do with the investigation. What will Democrats do about it? We'll expose any involvement he has in it. He needs to know if he takes any action to curb what Mr. Mueller does, we'll find out about it. We'll expose it. I would call on my colleagues right now to avoid the constitutional crisis. Take action now. Speak out against this appointment. You can imagine if a democratic president whose administration was effectively under investigation appointed someone as attorney general who expressed hostility to that investigation, talked about crippling it, the cry. They would be right. We're right to raise this. This is an attack on the rule of law. The question for my GOP colleagues is will they have the same stand behind rule of law as their GOP predecessors had concerning watergate. Thank you, congressman.

I happen to think at this point I'm the best person for that. What do you make of Marcia fudge considering to challenge you? I say it to everybody. Come on it. The water is warm. The water may be warm, but Nancy Pelosi says she's confident she's the next speaker of the house. Here fate may be decided by the newest representatives on the hill, including the surge of women coming into the congress bringing the female house ranks from 84 up to more than 100 for the first time. To get a sense of what they bring to Washington, we spoke to five incoming democratic congress women. An air force veteran, a CIA officer, one of the first native American women in congress, the youngest African American woman ever elect and a former cabinet secretary. I started by asking that what it means to be joining the ranks of congress. It's a remarkable privilege to be part of this group. It really is an important step for congress to better represent the face of the nation. As you can see from our faces, I think we're a better representation of what's been missing in congress. Abigail, what do women bring to congress? I was a former CIA officer. We've got an engineer, a bevy of experience here. Part of who I am and part of how I view the world is the fact I'm a mother, a daughter, a sister, a wife. In everything I'm looking at that perspective is valuable. I was walking across the capitol to take our freshman photograph, two young native girls from South Dakota ran up behind me and tapped me on the shoulder. Their mother came over and they were all crying. All of us were crying. To have a native American on the hill. Yes, for a group of folks in our country who have been here for thousands of years and being so under represented in congress, I think it means a tremendous amount for folks in those communities. Lauren, part of the diversity is age. You're the youngest African American member of the house. Ever. Ever. Our voices have not been heard in the halls of the congress for too long. Now we have not just one vote at the table, we have a caucus. We have a true millennial caucus now in the house of representatives. I think it's a significant step forward and an opportunity for progress. Do you think you view things differently? I think my approach to problem solving and the process with which we make decisions can be more transparent and inclusive. Our use of social media, taking a peek behind the veil of what congress is like. Donna, you're a newcomer to Washington, but not a newcomer to Washington. That's true, I'm a freshman, but not a rookie. It's been pretty exciting. People that walk through the halls and work hearsay welcome back. They remember when I was here as a cabinet officer. I know you're all optimistic. Be realistic here. There's still a Republican senate, a Republican president. How do you really make progress? Why not start with an issue, something that you can agree on? I feel like we need to find what those things are, what can we agree on. Let's make some friends and reach out. In the end it matters that we are representing our districts in the right way and they expect us to come here and do some work and not just start fights. As deb mentioned, there's an agenda we all agree on. In the 115th congress they wouldn't call a floor vote. One of the prime examples in my mind is paid family leave. Donald Trump campaigned on it. He deputized his daughter ivanka to go and be a shepherd in the caucus and she couldn't get it done because they wouldn't call a floor vote. When I think about opportunities for bipartisan action, there are many opportunities that now we can call a vote. There are many opportunities for bipartisan action. That creates a foundation we can build upon. We just went through hard elections. We flipped the house. We're tough enough, strong enough and focussed enough to get things done. I want to work on health care. That affects everybody. We won our election very much with health care as one of the major issues and you can't ignore that. Is that to you the one thing that Democrats have to make happen before 2020? Absolutely. Absolutely. It is the issue of my district. Is investigating president trump and his administration a priority for you? Of course we want to hold this administration accountable. At the same time we need to deal with the health issues. We need to deal with the environmental issues. Do you worry that any of your democratic colleagues might overplay the hand on investigating trump? I worry the media is overplaying that. There's a time and place that the oversight needs to happen, but the narrative of our congress needs to be what we're getting done for the people. In the democratic party there's more traditional, more Progressive. How do you square those and have a democratic message going into 2020? I think there's always going to be a spectrum. We're a big tent party. When we lead, we have to carry forward the voices of the people back home. We cannot fall down these rabbit holes about what kind of Democrat are you. Let me go down the row and ask you all the same question. Are you voting for Nancy Pelosi? I am. I've not made up my mind. Yes. No, I'm not. I haven't made up my mind. What will help you make up your mind? Her staff, everyone will say, look, she helped get you all elected. I have enormous respect for leader Pelosi. I want to understand what kind of reform can happen on the floor so young voices and new voices can be heard. Abigail, you've been firm that you will not vote for Nancy Pelosi as speaker. Why not? If we're going to turn a page and bring civility back to the discussions, we need to change the people directing that conversation. I, like Chrissy said, have tremendous respect for everything that leader Pelosi has done. We're all sitting here in part because of the path she has blazed for us. I have been clear and honest about my intentions. She's the only person I believe we need in this tumultuous time with the president we have, to stay on track, to make sure we're fulfilling the promises to the American people. Donna, what would you say to Abigail about Nancy Pelosi? I would look at what the job is and it's a little bit of herding cats and keeping a democratic party that's full of lots of different points of view. I think Nancy has demonstrated that time and time again she has a backbone. She'll stand up to a president. This is not forever, but right now at this time, in this transition for the next two years, I'm with her. We'll have to wait and see what happens. Our thanks to them for that conversation.

He also serves on the senate intelligence committee. I want to turn back to Saudi Arabia. You heard congressman Schiff saying what he thinks should happen regarding the khashoggi report. Should the president issue sanctions on the crown prince? Like Adam we had a briefing this week. I can't really talk about that briefing. I do think that it won't hurt here for another few days to pass. The president says he'll have some conclusions by Tuesday on this. Certainly the way you look at Saudi Arabia and the way it runs, it's hard to imagine something like this could happen without the crown prince knowing. I don't know that we absolutely know that yet. Just from reading the reports in the \"Washington post,\" we heard about phone calls that were intercepted. I know you can't talk about it. We heard phone calls intercepted between the prince and his brother. We heard about tapes inside the Saudi consulate in Turkey. What more is needed? The same question that I asked congressman Schiff. There doesn't appear to be a smoking gun, but there's a lot of evidence piling up. A smoking gun would certainly help. If you actually did have that specific thing that's unlikely to be out there or unlikely to be found where someone gave a specific direction and you know that happened. I also agree the economy is not a reason to worry about the relationship. Balance in the Middle East is, who's going to be in control there is. I'm in favor of what we tried to do with Russia and other countries, barring people from coming to the country, having an economic impact. I think we have to see whether we can make the case that the crown prince would be one of those people. The president comes out on Tuesday and you know what you know and he says we can't prove anything, what would your reaction be? I do know what I know. Let's see what the president says on Tuesday. High confidence doesn't mean you actually have what you need if that's the term the CIA is using. I'm not talking about what we heard this week, but what we read in the paper this morning. If that is accurate, it means we don't quite have all the information we would like to have. It would be nice -- if we're going to deal with this relationship which would impact the balance of power in the Middle East. It impacts the balance to Iran which is clearly a bad actor. We need to be absolutely sure we know exactly what we're talking about and not what the first step is, but also what the second and third step that that first step would lead you to really determines. There's been some question about what the president knew and when on the crown prince's role in khashoggi's death. Take a look at this tweet from president Obama's deputy we're faced with the real possibility that trump has had info from his own Intel community that mbs was responsible for murdering a journalist who wrote for the \"Washington post\" and lied about it and tried to help mbs get past it. Must be investigated. Do you think he knew something before and khashoggi should have been warned? I don't know the specific answer. I do know I know more than Ben Rhodes. I think that's pretty wild speculation. Are you concerned the president has ignored the intelligence in order to protect the relationship? No. Not at all? No. I want to move to the Mueller investigation and about Whitaker. President trump weighed in on Twitter. The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They've found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with answers they want. They've gone absolutely nuts? Have you seen any evidence of that? I don't know what the president is talking about. I do know it's not news that the president thinks this of the Mueller investigation. Most members of the house and senate have engaged saying Mr. President it would be a huge mistake not letting the Mueller investigation come to a conclusion. We need to get beyond this. We don't need to have this starting again. You have confidence in the Mueller investigation? I do. Let's talk about the acting attorney general, Matt Whitaker. Lindsey graham said on another program this morning I don't know if he's the best choice. What do you think about that? Well, what we really need is a permanent attorney general. We need to move as quickly as we can beyond the acting attorney general to the attorney general who's going to be there for a much longer period of time. We'll see. I don't know Matt Whitaker well. I've known him for sometime. I met him in Iowa when he was U.S. Attorney. On the occasions I've had with him he's been very responsive and has seen that the justice department responded to the things I asked about. In terms of an acting capacity he seems to me to be the person who has the ability to do the acting job. But not a permanent position? Is that what you're saying? I would think not, but the president needs to determine who is going to be permanently at the justice department as quickly as he can. What are you looking for? One of our big challenges is our friends on the other side on the senate have made it so hard to get anybody confirmed to anything. The president is unlikely to make that nomination before the congress reconvenes. If he did, we would be unlikely to do anything with it. We are way beyond the time where you have a hearing and a week later somebody gets confirmed to these jobs, no matter how insignificant they are. This one of course is very significant. Tell me what you're looking for in an attorney general, if not Matt Whitaker. Well, I think what the president should be looking for is someone who can manage the justice department, who understands the impact of that department, hopefully has had some experience working with or in the department before that. As for the Mueller investigation? As for the Mueller investigation, I think the Mueller investigation is going forward. In terms of an attorney general? In terms of an attorney general, the big question here on the Mueller investigation I think is whether the congress has any ability to tell the president who can work in the executive branch. That's a constitutional question. It's different than the question of whether Mueller should be allowed to continue. It's what could you do about. This idea that we would have a debate and have a vote and put a bill on the president's desk that he wouldn't sign, I don't think that's nearly as impactful as members continuing to say Mr. President, we need to get beyond this and you need to let it come to a conclusion. I don't have any reason to believe Matt Whitaker feels differently. Thank you for joining us. You bet.

Jerry Brown and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who will replace Brown as governor on Jan. 7, as well as FEMA Administrator Brock Long and local officials responding to the emergency.\n\nAt least 79 people have died as a result of the fires, 76 in Northern California\u2019s Camp Fire and three in Southern California\u2019s Woolsey Fire. The Camp Fire is the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state\u2019s history, according to Cal Fire. Nearly 1,300 people were missing in the Camp Fire, but that number continues to change, and more than 700 people who were once on the the list have since been accounted for, according to Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea.\n\nIn a separate interview on \u201cThis Week,\u201d Honea said the list of people unaccounted for is compiled from a number of sources, cautioning that the data is \u201craw\u201d and verifying people\u2019s whereabouts is \u201ca very difficult process.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy thought on that was it's better to work towards progress than achieve perfection before we start getting that information out,\u201d Honea said of the massive list of names.\n\nThe sheriff said he does not expect the death toll to be as high as the list of people unaccounted for, but noted that verifying people\u2019s whereabouts \u201cis a daunting task.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are still trying to bring order to the chaos that this entire event has caused,\u201d he said.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nAs of Sunday morning, the Camp Fire was 60 percent contained and had burned almost 150,000 acres and destroyed more than 12,000 structures, according to the Butte County Fire Department. The Woolsey Fire has burned just under 100,000 acres and was 88 percent contained as of Sunday morning, the Los Angeles County Fire Department reported.\n\nHonea called the Camp Fire an unprecedented event, and urged residents to make every effort to reach out to their friends and family to let them know they\u2019re safe and unharmed.

Common dishes included baked macaroni and cheese, seafood paella or baked ziti with \u201cas much meat as they could get into it.\u201d\n\nHe said that his fried mackerel specialty \u201ccomes in cans and you make breading out of cornflakes and you can deep-fry it in oil derived from mayonnaise.\u201d\n\n\"I made it many times, frying it in a huge tuna fish can, or my illicit work -- on top of a heating coil removed from a plastic hot pot,\" Genis said.\n\nLocation, location, location\n\nCooking capabilities were location-dependent, Genis said. In maximum security facilities, prisoners would reconfigure the few electronics they were allowed in their cells to help create new cooking tools, and then porters would pass plates back and forth to cells so prisoners could sample the various dishes inmates made.\n\nIn medium security prisons, the common room microwave was in high demand, Genis said, \u201cso people have to really schedule their use of the microwave on Thanksgiving Day.\u201d\n\nHis most luxurious prison holiday was Thanksgiving, 2008 -- when he and other prisoners arranged to have a rabbi bring in a turkey that they paid for -- to help them secure the use of the institution\u2019s oven for a few hours.\n\nCourtesy Daniel Genis\n\n\u201cThe only way we got around the rules of this was by claiming we needed a Kosher turkey,\u201d Genis said, calling the oven use \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\u201d\n\nThese makeshift potluck meals supplement the state-issued menus, which differ by state but tend to include the staples of turkey, gravy and cranberry sauce.\n\n'Very special' or 'terrible and depressing'\n\nThis year, according to a spokesperson for Oklahoma\u2019s Department of Corrections, state prisons there will serve green bean casserole, mashed potatoes and corn as sides.\n\nOklahoma DOC\n\nCalifornia prisoners will have stuffing and either sweet potato or pumpkin pie, \u201cdepending on what the institution gets,\u201d as well as ice cream and other desserts, said Bill Sessa, the spokesman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.\n\nThe menu for Thanksgiving in New York prisons includes bread dressing and sliced carrots in addition to the same staples as others.\n\nThe timing differs slightly for different prison systems, as it will be Thanksgiving lunch for New York inmates, but turkey time won\u2019t come until dinner in California because that prison system serves hot meals at breakfast and dinner while lunch is a bagged and cold.\n\nIn Hawaiian prisons, the festive food is spread out a bit more, with baked ham in a pineapple glaze at lunch along with pumpkin pie and a seasonal side, which could be sweet potatoes or candied yams, and then at dinner the traditional roast turkey is served, along with stuffing, gravy, mashed potatoes, corn and dessert.\n\nOklahoma DOC\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking, I think Thanksgiving -- just like all prison food -- varies widely and deeply between different prisons and institutions,\u201d Camplin said.\n\n\u201c \u201d If the state meal is way of saying \u2018you guys don\u2019t deserve a real Thanksgiving,\u2019 the prisoners meal is a way of saying \u2018we do.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inconsistent and it can, depending on the facility you\u2019re in, it can be very special and they can go all out or it can be terrible and depressing,\u201d she said.\n\nCamplin said that on the generous end of the spectrum, she has heard of wardens giving inmates almost a half turkey each.\n\nThanksgiving on 56 cents a plate\n\nBy contrast, one example Camplin pointed out Joe Arpaio, Arizona\u2019s former Maricopa County sheriff, who boasted in a 2013 tweet that the Thanksgiving meal for those in his care only cost the state 56 cents per person.\n\nThanksgiving menu is all set!

Americans know it for M&Ms, but it sells gravy in South Africa and mustard in Australia.\n\nAs a private, family-owned company \u2014 with $35 billion in annual revenue \u2014 Mars has some leeway to experiment. It's working on a chickpea-based snack that could help fight child malnutrition in India. It even developed a DNA test for cats and dogs.\n\n\"We're a 100-year-old business. We intend to be around 100 years from now, and part of what is incumbent upon us is to evolve with the times,\" says Mars Chairman Stephen Badger, the great-grandson of Mars' founder Franklin Mars.\n\nBadger spoke to The Associated Press about candy, nutrition and other parts of Mars' business. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ. What do you do about the trend toward healthy eating and the way candy is perceived?\n\nA. It's very, very much at the forefront of our mind. We're a calories-in business, not a calories-expenditure business. And we take very seriously the notion of ensuring that consumers know what our products contain. We ensure that on the front of the pack we put caloric information, and then on the back of the pack we put nutritional information as well. So even in advance of, or in excess of, what a country might require legally, we're committed to ensuring that consumers know what's in our products. Also, with our confectionary products, we are really very clear that they are treats. They're not a meal, they're not a meal replacement and they're not meant to be eaten with meals. Consumer information is at the forefront of what we try to do.\n\nQ. Candy is an impulse buy. How will the growth of online shopping change that?\n\nA. I think it's not going to change \u2014 I think it has changed. Hard retail will always be there. I think it's up to retailers to figure out how to entice consumers so they actually have an experience that makes them want to come back. That being said, as a manufacturer it's really incumbent upon us to try to figure out how to generate that impulse online. It's through a lot of rolling up our sleeves and getting dirty with testing and learning both in our own right as well as in partnership with the likes of Alibaba, Tencent or Amazon.\n\nQ. You have partnered with Kind, which makes nutrition bars, and you're working on your own high-protein snacks to fight malnutrition. Why is that part of your business?\n\nA. When you look at us as the third-largest food manufacturer in the world, and you look at the scale of the issues facing the world \u2014 whether it's sustainability, income, human rights, child labor \u2014 those issues need to be dealt with. Then you fast-forward to the other side of the equation, in terms of consumers and how are we going to feed the 7 billion that we have, not to mention the 12 billion we're projected to get to. It's going to have to be in some kind of sustainable fashion and it's going to have to be affordable. It's going to have to be accessible. It's going to have to be all of those at scale. I'm not suggesting there's one product that is going to fix all of that, but it is a product that in the mix can really fundamentally change the trajectory of childhood nutrition.\n\nQ. Why is Mars in the veterinary business?\n\nA. How do you stay open to trends and understand what's transpiring? I think it's by keeping your ear to the ground and looking at opportunities and sometimes making small investments and placing bets and then seeing where those bets go. Our entrance into veterinary care was predicated on an opportunity to invest in Banfield (a chain of more than 975 vet hospitals). What started as a small investment grew over time. It opened our eyes to the reality that if we really want a better world for pets, the best way to do that is to invest in the veterinary practice. I wouldn't be honest if I said we've figured out how to bring to life the totality of that ecosystem, but we can see a real pathway through a number of angles."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Pope prays for those stricken by California wildfires", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

The previous record was set by Jeff Koons' \"Balloon Dog\" in 2013.\n\nThe rendition of \"Portrait of an Artist\" that was sold was painted in April 1972 for an exhibition in New York City the following month.

During a period like this you don't go to elections,\" he said.\n\nThe sudden coalition crisis was sparked by the resignation of the hawkish Lieberman, who had demanded a far stronger response last week to the most massive wave of rocket attacks on Israel since the 2014 Israel-Hamas war. He alleges the cease-fire agreement reached with Gaza's Hamas rulers will put southern Israel under a growing threat from the group, similar to that posed to northern Israel by Lebanon's heavily armed Hezbollah group.\n\nThe departure of Lieberman and his Yisrael Beitenu party leaves the coalition with a one-seat majority in the 120-member parliament. Netanyahu's other partners say that makes governing untenable and would leave the coalition susceptible to the extortion of any single lawmaker until elections scheduled for November 2019.\n\nEducation Minister Naftali Bennett, of the pro-settler Jewish Home party, has already threatened to bring down the government if he is not appointed defense minister.

Since then, elections have almost always been moved up because of a coalition crisis or a strategic move by the prime minister to maximize his chances of re-election.\n\nThough Netanyahu has been reportedly flirting with the idea of moving up elections himself in recent months, the current timing is not ideal for him.\n\nHe has come under heavy criticism for agreeing to the Gaza cease-fire, especially from within his own political base and in the working-class, rocket-battered towns in southern Israel that are typically strongholds of his Likud Party. But with Lieberman forcing his hand and the other coalition partners appearing eager to head to the polls he may not have a choice.\n\nMost opinion polls show Netanyahu easily securing re-election, which would secure him a place in Israeli history as the country's longest serving leader.

As his defense allowed big play after big play to the Terrapins on Saturday, Meyer looked as if every yard was a sharp stick poking him in the neck. Each penalty on Ohio State, wiping out a positive play for the Buckeyes, seemed to zap Meyer like an electric shock.\n\n\"I'm relieved we won,\" Meyer said.\n\nThe Buckeyes coach has dealt for years with a congenital arachnoid cyst in his brain that causes what his doctor has called aggressive headaches. Meyer had surgery to address the issue in the spring of 2014.\n\nMeyer, 54, is not a sympathetic figure for most fans outside of those who root for the Buckeyes. Even in Florida, where he led the Gators to two national championships, Meyer is remembered as much for bailing out abruptly when things started going bad and leaving behind a dysfunctional team. He said health issues and a desire to spend more time with his family led him to step aside, but after a year away he landed at Ohio State, coaching the team he grew up rooting for. Meyer and the Buckeyes have been rolling ever since \u2014 80-9 with a national title.\n\nThe first taste of turmoil in Columbus for Meyer came this offseason, when he was suspended for the first three games for his handling of former assistant coach Zach Smith, who had been accused by his ex-wife of domestic abuse.\n\nMeyer has faced numerous questions since his return to the sideline about his future as Ohio State coach and his health. He has said he expects to be back in 2019. But in a season in which there has been limited drama on the field \u2014 with No. 1 Alabama and No. 2 Clemson stomping toward a seemingly inevitable College Football Playoff championship matchup \u2014 whether Meyer can continue to be Ohio State coach has become the most intriguing story of 2018.\n\nAmazing as it may seem with how the ninth-ranked Buckeyes (10-1, 7-1, No. 10 CFP) have played this season, they head into the rivalry game against No. 4 Michigan (10-1, 8-0, No. 4 CFP) a victory away from winning the Big Ten East and playing for the conference title.\n\nThe playoff is still a possibility, too. But what happens at Ohio State after the games have been played?\n\nBIG 12 MADNESS\n\nIn the last four weeks, Oklahoma State has beaten No. 13 Texas, taken No. 6 Oklahoma to overtime and, now, beaten No. 7 West Virginia. Oh, and the Cowboys have also lost to Baylor.\n\nThe Big 12 race is a little bananas and Oklahoma State has epitomized the on-any-given-Saturday nature of the conference. On this Saturday, the Cowboys dealt a severe blow to both West Virginia's chances of reaching the Big 12 title game and the Mountaineers' playoff hopes. WVU led by 10 twice in the fourth quarter only to allow two touchdowns in the last five minutes.\n\nTexas beat No. 18 Iowa State with relative and surprising ease and Oklahoma allowed 40 points and more 500 yards to Kansas \u2014 and still won by two touchdowns.\n\nWest Virginia's loss means the chances of the Mountaineers and Sooners playing two straight weeks just dropped precipitously.\n\nIt will all be decided Black Friday. Texas earns a spot in the Big 12 title game by winning at Kansas. And if the Longhorns win, the winner of Oklahoma-WVU that night in Morgantown goes to the Big 12 title game the following week.\n\nIf Texas loses, it gets a little more complicated, but the Longhorns are not necessarily eliminated. Yes, the Longhorns could lose to Kansas and play for the Big 12 title \u2014 which sounds crazy but this is the Big 12.\n\nSE-SIESTA\n\nFor a half, The Citadel gave college football fans a few laughs. The Bulldogs and their triple-option were tied at half, 10-10, with No. 1 Alabama. Whoa! Early in the second half The Citadel kicked a field goal to take a 13-10, lead but a penalty took the points off the board and the re-kick was no good and that was that .\n\nThe SEC's Siesta weekend otherwise went according to plan: Eight SEC teams 398, nonconference opponents 116.\n\nAROUND THE COUNTRY\n\nHeisman Watch: Tua Tagovailoa, Alabama; Kyler Murray, Oklahom; Gardner Minshew, Washington State . That might be it for finalists. ... Oregon beat Arizona State and No. 21 Utah, which closed its conference schedule with a rout of Colorado, is the Pac-12 South champion. Been an unusual season for the Utes, with a slow start, followed by a surge, followed by some key injuries, but they will play in the conference title game for the first time since joining the Pac-12 in 2011. Utah will face the winner of the Apple Cup between No. 8 Washington State and No. 17 Washington . ... No. 11 UCF basked in the spotlight, pummeling No. 19 Cincinnati in a prime-time showcase game to run its winning streak to 23 games and clinch a spot in the American Athletic Conference championship. The Knights still have to face USF next weekend and the winner of Memphis-Houston game awaits in the AAC title game. ... Did Illinois coach Lovie Smith do something to anger Iowa's Kirk Ferentz? The Hawkeyes handed the Illini their most lopsided loss in 112 years . ... Just when it seemed Texas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury had worked his way off the hot seat and maybe into a contract extension, the Red Raiders have lost three straight, including a stunningly ugly setback at Kansas State. Was that K-State coach Bill Snyder's last home game? ... Pitt (7-4) joined Northwestern as unlikely division winners, blowing out Wake Forest to wrap up the ACC Coastal and its first trip to conference title game. ... In the last two weeks, USC, with a chance to win the Pac-12 South, lost to Cal for the first time in 15 years and to the worst team UCLA has fielded maybe in 30 years. Good luck, Clay Helton. ... Florida State's 36-year bowl streak is still alive after the Seminoles beat Boston College. They'll host rival No. 15 Florida next week, looking for a sixth win. ... This has been probably the best four-win season in Nebraska history. The Cornhuskers edged Michigan State for their fourth victory in the last five games. Scott Frost's team finishes at Iowa on Friday, and no matter what happens Nebraska fans have to think the program is headed in the right direction.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Ralph D.

Seventeen years after the U.S.-led invasion that ended Taliban rule, the militants control nearly half of Afghanistan and carry out near-daily attacks on local security forces and government officials.\n\nThe U.S. administration now appears focused on reaching a political settlement with the Taliban, and has given in to a number of the group's longstanding demands, beginning with the holding of direct talks. The Taliban have long refused U.S. demands to negotiate with the Western-backed government in Kabul, which the insurgents view as a puppet regime.\n\nPakistan has meanwhile released a number of high-level Taliban prisoners, including the movement's co-founder, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. The releases are widely seen as a U.S.-directed move aimed at encouraging the Taliban to participate in talks.\n\nKhalilzad on Sunday said he was \"cautiously optimistic,\" a peace settlement, which he preferred to call a \"roadmap to Afghanistan's future,\" could be hammered out among rival Afghans. What that roadmap will look like and what rights and guarantees it will enshrine, including women's rights and rule of law, will be a decision for Afghans to make, said Khalilzad.\n\nThe United States has spoken \"loudly and proudly\" for equal rights for men and women, said Khalilzad, but how \u2014\u2014 or even if \u2014\u2014those rights are woven into Afghanistan's \"roadmap for the future,\" will be decided by Afghans. Saying he would like to see a settlement \"sooner rather than later,\" he urged both sides in Afghanistan's protracted conflict to consider next year's presidential elections, scheduled for April 20, as the deadline for peace.\n\nThe Taliban, who spoke about the talks in Qatar said Khairullah Khairkhwah, the former Taliban governor of Herat, and Mohammed Fazl, a former Taliban military chief, attended the marathon talks. The Taliban spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the sensitive negotiations.\n\nA third individual with knowledge of the discussions said the Taliban pressed for a postponement of next year's presidential elections and the establishment of an interim government under a neutral leadership. Abdul Sattar Sirat, an ethnic Tajik and Islamic scholar, was suggested as a candidate to lead an interim administration.\n\nThe individual, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks, said Khalilzad wants to reach a settlement within six months, a timescale the Taliban said was too short. Khalilzad also proposed a cease-fire, which the Taliban rejected, the individual said, adding that there was no agreement on the release of prisoners, opening the Taliban office or lifting a Taliban travel ban.\n\nKhairkhwah and Fazl were among five senior Taliban members released from the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay in 2014 in exchange for U.S. Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who was captured by the Taliban after walking off his base in Afghanistan in 2009. The five are now based in Qatar, and are seen as having enough stature to sell a peace deal to insurgents fighting on the front lines.\n\nPresident Donald Trump harshly criticized the 2014 prisoner exchange, and in a speech last August pledged to send in additional U.S. forces and redouble efforts to defeat the Taliban. But that strategy has had little if any impact on the ground, with the Taliban keeping up a steady tempo of attacks and an Islamic State affiliate carrying out massive bombings targeting minority Shiites.\n\nIn a lengthy statement issued earlier this month, the Taliban had demanded the lifting of sanctions against the group's leaders, the release of prisoners and the recognition of their office in Qatar. The Afghan government is deeply opposed to any recognition of the Qatar office, which the Taliban in the past have billed as a government in exile.\n\nKhalilzad has been touring the region in recent days. In meetings in Kabul, Khalilzad is expected to press Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to cobble together his own negotiating team, which could prove difficult given the deep divisions within the government."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says leaders at APEC summit couldn't reach consensus on final communique", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Months later, her disfiguring injuries forced her to drop out of school after other students complained about her \"scary face.\"\n\nFeeling helpless, Saleem recently turned to social media to find help. Eventually, her appeal grabbed the attention of a surgeon who offered free treatment.\n\nOthers have also reached out on social media.\n\nEmotional videos and photographs of Iraqis with war wounds and disabilities have overwhelmed social media platforms, mainly , widely used in Iraq.\n\nThe widespread violence unleashed by the 2003 toppling of Saddam Hussein and the 2014-2017 battle against the Islamic State group has wounded hundreds of thousands of Iraqis. Many are maimed and scarred, their suffering lingering long after the violence subsides.\n\nPoor medical services, scarcity of specialized staff and medical centers, and poverty have exacerbated the suffering. Those who cannot get treatment at state-run hospitals and cannot afford private clinics are looking to social media platforms to make appeals.\n\nAppeals are posted on the personal Facebook pages of patients or on the pages of aid organizations and public figures with tens of thousands of followers. Patients describe their condition along with contact details. Messages are also distributed on platforms like WhatsApp and Viber.\n\nSaleem and her family recall the explosion that upended her life, and the years that followed as they struggled financially to get her treatment.\n\n\"When I hit the ground, I felt severe pain all over my body ... I was bleeding, a pool of blood around me ... everything turned dark and I lost consciousness,\" she recalled from her bed at a Baghdad hospital where she is undergoing free reconstructive and plastic surgeries.\n\nSaleem's mother, Khawla Omar Hussein, remembers her daughter's screams when three weeks later, she regained consciousness and realized she had lost her right arm and ear.\n\n\"She woke up screaming, crying: 'Mammy, mammy',\" Hussein recalled. \"Then she asked: 'Why can't I see and why is everything dark?'\"\n\nThey told her it was the bandages over her eyes and that she would see after they were removed. When that day came, the doctors told her she had lost both eyes.\n\nNearly two years later, Saleem's family tried to send her back to school where she was accepted only as a \"listener\" in class, accompanying her brothers. But that arrangement ended soon as other students and teachers complained that her disfigured face was bothering them.\n\n\"I was crying day and night and became a very reclusive person,\" Saleem said.\n\nAfter the state-run hospital couldn't go beyond the necessary treatment to save her life, Saleem's family looked for plastic and reconstructive surgery for her at a private clinic, but they couldn't afford the doctor's $7,500 fee.\n\nThen, late last year, her mother made an appeal, posting photographs of Saleem and details about her ordeal in a public group on Viber. Days later, Baghdad-based Dr. Abbas al-Sahan, one of Iraq's best plastic surgeons, offered to do free surgeries.\n\nSince January, Saleem has undergone four surgeries \u2014 first so her face could accommodate the two glass eyes, or ocular prostheses, then a procedure to reduce some of the scars. She also had a surgery to adjust to a prosthetic arm and is due to have plastic surgery to reconstruct her missing ear, al-Sahan said.\n\nAl-Sahan runs the only state-run specialized hospital for reconstructive and plastic surgery in Iraq. He said that about 40 percent of the monthly surgeries his hospital preforms \u2014 between 600 to 850 \u2014 are for victims of bombings and other war-related explosions, as well as for casualties of military operations.\n\nSaleem's family feels she is lucky. Not everyone gets the help they need through social media.\n\nIraqi army Capt. Salar al-Jaff was shot by a sniper in January 2017, during the height of the fight to recapture the northern city of Mosul from the Islamic State group. The bullet hit him in the head and left him paralyzed in one side of his body.\n\nSince then, he has been treated for the head wound and for complications from lying in bed all the time, but not for the paralysis. He sold his car and all his possessions to be able to afford three injections a day, each costing $100, to overcome the pain.\n\nHe also appeared in a video, posted on social media, alongside a cleric who asks that someone help al-Jaff.\n\nBut so far, there have been no offers for free treatment.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Sinan Salaheddin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/sinansm"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "In Jordan's ancient Petra, sirens warn of flash floods", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Sirens blared minutes before a torrent fed by heavy rains approached the UNESCO World Heritage site carved into rose-hued rock face.\n\nHundreds of tourists were able to seek higher ground and were later evacuated, he said.\n\nAmateur video posted online at the time showed visitors running through a steep, narrow canyon leading to the Treasury, Petra's main draw, as guides urged them to hurry.

Thirty-four people were killed in flash floods in late September and early November.\n\nThe last fatal flash flood struck Petra in 1963 when 22 French tourists and a local guide were killed by rapidly rising waters. In response, Jordan's Department of Antiquities built a dam to keep water from entering the canyon leading to the Treasury.\n\nIn 2014, the alarm system was installed as added protection, with sirens set to go off when flood water rises above a certain level.\n\nOn Nov. 9, the system was triggered for the first time, through a computer in the Petra Authority's control room. The computer is connected to eight rain forecast systems and two water detection stations placed in the area, within 8 kilometers (5 miles) of Petra.\n\nThe network generates instant data allowing officials to measure possible danger and warn people by the time the water reaches Petra.\n\nOmar Dajani, a meteorologist at the Arabia Weather company, said alarms should be installed in all vulnerable areas in Jordan.\n\nHe said urban sprawl has exacerbated the flood risk, which is particularly high in dry areas.\n\n\"Now towns have spread so much and many of them were not built with respect for the geography of the region, such as valleys for example, where the water has naturally caused floods for millions of years,\" Dajani said."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "California wildfires: President Trump tours CA damage, meets with firefighters and local leaders - ABC News", "description": "ABC News California wildfires: President Trump tours CA damage, meets with firefighters and local leaders ABC News President Donald Trump surveyed the devastation from the California wildfires on Saturday, touring a neighborhood in badly ravaged Paradise and \u2026", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/california-wildfires-president-trump-heads-state-tour-damage/story?id%3D59240106", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T06:09:00Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "bad url"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Death toll rises to 76 in California fire with winds ahead", "description": "Northern California crews braced for strong winds, with gusts up to 50mph, that could erode gains they've made against the country's deadliest wildfire in a century", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/death-toll-rises-76-california-fire-winds-ahead-59274568", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/WireAP_cfb6058b19d94f379e6389fdfa4ccbf4_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-18T05:40:28Z", "content": "Northern California crews battling the country's deadliest wildfire in a century were bracing for strong winds, with gusts up to 50 miles per hour, creating the potential to erode gains they have made in containing a disaster that has killed at least 76 and l\u2026 [+3857 chars]", "fulltext": "Volunteers in white coveralls, hard hats and masks poked through ash and debris Sunday, searching for the remains of victims of the devastating Northern California wildfire before rains forecast this week complicate their efforts.\n\nWhile the predicted downpours could help tamp down blazes that have killed 77 people so far, they also could wash away telltale fragments of bone, or turn loose, dry ash into a thick paste that would frustrate the search.\n\nA team of 10 volunteers went from burned house to burned house Sunday in the devastated town of Paradise, accompanied by a cadaver dog with a bell on its collar that jingled in the grim landscape.\n\nThe members of the team scrutinized the rubble in five-minute sweeps, using sticks to move aside debris and focused on vehicles, bathtubs and what was left of mattresses. When no remains were found, they spray-painted a large, orange \"0'' near the house.\n\nUp to 400 people were involved in the overall search and recovery effort. Robert Panak, a volunteer on a different team from Napa County, spent the morning searching homes, but didn't find any remains.\n\nAsked whether the job was tough, the 50-year-old volunteer said, \"I just think about the positives, bringing relief to the families, closure.\"\n\nHe said his approach was to try to picture the house before it burned and think where people might have hidden.\n\nNearly 1,300 names are on a list of people unaccounted for more than a week after the fire began in Butte County, authorities said late Saturday. They stressed that the long roster does not mean they believe all those on the list are missing.\n\nSheriff Kory Honea pleaded with evacuees to review the list of those reported as unreachable by family and friends and to call the department if those people are known to be safe.\n\nDeputies have located hundreds of people to date, but the overall number keeps growing because they are adding more names, including those from the chaotic early hours of the disaster, Honea said.\n\n\"As much as I wish that we could get through all of this before the rains come, I don't know if that's possible,\" he said.\n\nHonea said it was within the \"realm of possibility\" that officials would never know the exact death toll from the blaze.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, more than 50 people gathered at a memorial for the victims at First Christian Church in Chico, where a banner on the altar read, \"We will rise from the ashes.\"\n\nPeople hugged and shed tears as Pastor Jesse Kearns recited a prayer for first responders: \"We ask for continued strength as they are growing weary right now.\"\n\nHundreds of search and recovery personnel are involved in the effort, going to homes when they receive tips that someone might have died there.\n\nBut they are also doing a more comprehensive, \"door-to-door\" and \"car-to-car\" search of areas, said Joe Moses, a commander with the Monterey County Sheriff's Office, who is helping oversee the search and rescue effort.\n\nThe search area is huge, Moses said, with many structures that need to be checked.\n\nThe fire also burned many places to the ground, creating a landscape unique to many search-and- rescue personnel, he said.\n\n\"Here we're looking for very small parts and pieces, and so we have to be very diligent and systematic in how we do your searches,\" he said Friday.\n\nThe remains of five more people were found Saturday, including four in Paradise and one in nearby Concow, bringing the number of dead to 77.\n\nAmong them was Lolene Rios, 56, whose son, Jed, tearfully told KXTV in Sacramento that his mother had an \"endless amount of love\" for him.\n\nPresident Donald Trump toured the area Saturday, joined by California's outgoing and incoming governors, both Democrats who have traded sharp barbs with the Republican administration. Trump also visited Southern California, where firefighters were making progress on a wildfire that tore through communities west of Los Angeles from Thousand Oaks to Malibu, killing three people.\n\n\"We've never seen anything like this in California; we've never seen anything like this yet. It's like total devastation,\" Trump said as he stood amid the ruins of Paradise and pledged the full support of the federal government.\n\nSoon after the fire began, Trump blamed state officials for poor forest management and threatened to cut off federal funding.\n\n\"He's got our back,\" outgoing Gov. Jerry Brown said Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\n\"There have been some back and forth between California leaders and the president,\" Brown said. \"But in the face of tragedy, people tend to rise above some of their lesser propensities. So I think we're on a good path.\"\n\nHe also suggested California's severe wildfires will make believers of even the most ardent climate change skeptics \"in less than five years,\" and that those living near forests might need to build underground shelters to protect them from fires.\n\nRain was forecast for midweek in the Paradise area. The National Weather Service said the area could get 20 mph (32 kph) sustained winds and 40 mph (64 kph) gusts, which could make it hard for crews to keep making progress against the blaze.\n\nNorthern California's Camp Fire has destroyed about 10,500 homes and torched 233 square miles (603 square kilometers). It was 65 percent contained.\n\nHonea expressed hope that Trump's visit would help with recovery, saying the tour by the Republican president and California's Democratic leaders \"signals a spirit of cooperation here that ultimately benefit this community and get us on a path toward recovery.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press journalists Terence Chea and Jonathan Lemire in Paradise, Christopher Weber in Los Angeles and Janie Har and Daisy P.

A statement was to be issued instead by the meeting's chair, Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O'Neill.\n\n\"The entire world is worried\" about tensions between China and the U.S., O'Neill told a mob of reporters that surrounded him after he confirmed there was no communique from leaders.\n\nIt was the first time leaders had failed to agree on a declaration in 29 years of the Pacific Rim summits that involve countries representing 60 percent of the world economy.\n\nDraft versions of the communique seen by The Associated Press showed the U.S wanted strong language against unfair trade practices that it accuses China of. China, meanwhile, wanted a reaffirmation of opposition to protectionism and unilateralism that it says the U.S. is engaging in.\n\nThe U.S. has imposed additional tariffs of $250 billion on Chinese goods this year and Beijing has retaliated with its own tariffs on American exports.\n\n\"I don't think it will come as a huge surprise that there are differing visions\" on trade, said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. \"Those prevented there from being a full consensus on the communique.\"\n\nThe two-day summit was punctuated by acrimony and also underlined a rising rivalry between China and the West for influence in the usually neglected South Pacific, where Beijing has been wooing impoverished island states with aid and loans.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Chinese President Xi Jinping traded barbs in speeches on Saturday.\n\nPence professed respect for Xi and China but also harshly criticized the world's No. 2 economy for intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers and unfair trading practices. He accused China of luring developing nations into a debt trap through the loans it offers for infrastructure.\n\nThe world, according to Xi's speech, is facing a choice between cooperation and confrontation as protectionism and unilateralism grows. He said the rules of global institutions set up after World War II such as the World Trade Organization should not be bent for selfish agendas.\n\nPence told reporters that during the weekend he had two \"candid\" conversations with Xi, who is expected to meet President Donald Trump at a Group of 20 summit at the end of this month in Argentina.\n\n\"There are differences today,\" Pence said. \"They begin with trade practices, with tariffs and quotas, forced technology transfers, the theft of intellectual property. It goes beyond that to freedom of navigation in the seas, concerns about human rights.\"\n\nThe U.S. is interested in a better relationship \"but there has to be change\" from China's side, Pence said he told Xi, who responded that dialogue is important.\n\nChina's foreign ministry rejected the U.S. criticism that it was leading other developing nations into debt bondage.\n\n\"The assistance provided by China has been warmly welcomed by our partners in this region and beyond,\" Wang Xiaolong, a foreign ministry official, told a news conference.\n\n\"No country either in this region or in other regions has fallen into a so called debt trap because of its cooperation with China. Give me one example,\" he said.\n\nChina is a relative newcomer to providing aid, and its loan-heavy, no-strings attached approach has unsettled Western nations that have been the mainstay donors to developing nations and often use aid to nudge nations towards reforms.\n\nIn Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea's capital, the impact of China's aid and loans is highly visible. But the U.S. and allies are countering with efforts to finance infrastructure in Papua New Guinea and other island states. The U.S. has also said it will be involved in ally Australia's plan to develop a naval base with Papua New Guinea.\n\nOn Sunday, the U.S., New Zealand, Japan and Australia said they'd work with Papua New Guinea's government to bring electricity to 70 percent of its people by 2030. Less than 20 percent have a reliable electricity supply.\n\n\"The commitment of the United States of America to this region of the world has never been stronger,\" Pence said at a signing ceremony. A separate statement from his office said other countries are welcome to join the electrification initiative provided they support the U.S. vision of a free and open Pacific.\n\nChina, meanwhile, has promised $4 billion of finance to build the the first national road network in Papua New Guinea, among the least urbanized countries in the world."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Swimmer in Australia dies after being stung by stingray", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

It's like total devastation,\" Trump said as he stood amid the ruins of Paradise, burned to the ground by a wildfire the president called \"this monster.\"\n\nBefore returning to Washington, Trump met briefly at an airport hangar with families and first responders touched by the shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks more than a week ago, which left 12 dead in what Trump called \"a horrible, horrible event.\" Reporters and photographers were not allowed to accompany the president to the session, which Trump later described as emotional.\n\n\"What can you say other than it's so sad to see. These are great people. Great families, torn apart,\" he told reporters. \"We just hugged them and we kissed them \u2014 and everybody. And it was very warm.\"\n\nHe added: \"It was tragic and yet, in one way, it was a very beautiful moment.\"\n\nTrump had made only one previous trip as president to California, a deeply Democratic and liberal state that he has blamed for a pair of overheated crises, illegal immigration and voter fraud. He also has been at odds with the state's Democratic-led government, but differences were generally put aside as Gov. Jerry Brown and Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom joined Trump in surveying the wildfire damage.\n\n\"We're going to have to work quickly,\" Trump said near the crumpled foundations of Paradise homes and twisted steel of melted cars. \"Hopefully this is going to be the last of these because this was a really, really bad one.\"\n\nIn a nod to his belief \u2014 not shared by all forest scientists \u2014 that improved forest management practices will diminish future risks, Trump added: \"I think everybody's seen the light and I don't think we'll have this again to this extent.\"\n\nWith that bold and perhaps unlikely prediction, Trump evoked his initial tweeted reaction to the fire, the worst in the state's history, in which he seemed to blame local officials and threatened to take away federal funding.\n\nHours later and hundreds of miles to the south, Trump found similar signs of devastation in the seaside conclave of Malibu, one of the areas of Southern California ravaged by wildfires that have killed at least three. Palm trees stood scorched and some homes were burned to the ground on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean.\n\nAt least 71 people have died across Northern California, and authorities are trying to locate more than 1,000 people, though not all are believed missing. More than 5,500 fire personnel were battling the blaze that covered 228 square miles (590 square kilometers) and was about 50 percent contained, officials said.\n\nWhen asked in Paradise if seeing the historic devastation, which stretched for miles and left neighborhoods destroyed and fields scorched, altered his opinion on climate change, Trump answered, \"No.\"\n\nThe president has long voiced skepticism about man's impact on the climate and has been reluctant to assign blame to a warming earth for the increase in the frequency and intensity of natural disasters.\n\nWearing a camouflage \"USA\" hat, Trump gazed solemnly at the devastation in Paradise. Several burned-out buses and cars were nearby. Trees were burned, their branches bare and twisted. Homes were totally gone; some foundations remained, as did a chimney and, in front of one house, a Mickey Mouse lawn ornament. The fire was reported to have moved through the area at 80 mph.\n\n\"It's going to work out well, but right now we want to take care of the people that are so badly hurt,\" Trump said while visiting what remained of the Skyway Villa Mobile Home and RV Park. He noted \"there are areas you can't even get to them yet\" and the sheer number of people unaccounted for.\n\n\"I think people have to see this really to understand it,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president later toured an operation center, met with response commanders and praised the work of firefighters, law enforcement and representatives of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nTrump took a helicopter tour en route to Chico before he toured Paradise. A full cover of haze and the smell of smoke greeted the president upon his arrival at Beale Air Force Base near Sacramento.\n\n\"They're out there fighting and they're fighting like hell,\" Trump said of the first responders.\n\nHe pledged that Washington would do its part by coming to the Golden State's aid and urged the House's Republican leader, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, a Trump ally and frequent White House visitor, to \"come to the office\" to help secure the needed funding.\n\nTrump long has struggled to convey empathy to victims of national disasters and tragedies. His first reaction to the fires came in a tweet last week that drew criticism as unnecessarily critical and tone-deaf given the devastation: \"There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests.\"\n\nAfter the negative reaction to that response, Trump shifted gears, expressing words of encouragement to first responders and those of sympathy for hit victims.\n\nNature and humans share blame for the wildfires, but fire scientists are divided as to whether forest management played a major role. Nature provides the dangerous winds that have whipped the fires, the state has been in a drought and human-caused climate change over the long haul is killing and drying the shrubs and trees that provide the fuel.\n\nWhen Trump was asked during an interview set to air on \"Fox News Sunday\" whether climate change played a role in the number of serious fires, he said \"maybe it contributes a little bit. The big problem we have is management.\"\n\nIn Northern California, Trump continued to show skepticism about the impact of climate change on wildfires. His grasp of forests was shaky at times, at one point invoking fire prevention efforts in Finland \u2014 it has a very different climate than California \u2014 as an example for the Golden State to follow.\n\nAsked if he thought climate change played a role in the fires, Brown responded: \"Yes. Yes. And we'll let science determine this over a longer period of time.\"\n\nA reporter asked if climate change was discussed with the president, but Trump jumped in to say, \"We didn't discuss it.\"\n\nA reporter then said, \"Well, you obviously disagree on this issue.\" Trump answered, in part: \"Maybe not as different as people think. Is it happening? Things are changing. And I think most importantly we're doing things about. We're gonna make it better. We're going to make it a lot better. And it's gonna happen as quickly as it can possibly happen.\"\n\nBrown and Newsom said they welcomed the president's visit, with the governor suggesting they set aside political differences since it \"now is a time to pull together for the people of California.\" A fierce advocate of addressing climate change, the governor pointed to several causes and said they need to deal with them.\n\n\"If you really look at the facts, from a really open point of view, there are a lot of elements to be considered,\" Brown said. \"The president came, he saw and I'm looking forward over the next months and beyond to really understand this threat of fire, the whole matter of drought and all the rest of it. It's not one thing, it's a lot of things and I think that if we just open our minds and look at things we'll get more stuff done.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Governor: Official who said whites are 'master race' must go", "description": "Kansas Gov.
