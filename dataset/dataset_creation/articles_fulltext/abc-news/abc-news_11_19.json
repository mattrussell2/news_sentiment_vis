Bob workers are constantly being paraded by. So many different about Arnold's classic is whether it's high heat conditions. Or no hard hard. I'm windy cold temperatures. Now these fires are adding to an already dangerous backbreaking difficult. Work and we're looking at photos are now of people working with masks and other kinds of precautions. Our day and their bosses trying to taped to preserve their safety. So under California law. Employers are required tube provide as much. Helped to their workers is possible the record provide. Any sort of protective personal equipment that they need and this case. Workers should be receiving. I agree. Reasonable masks so that they can Wear and in the singles as it working but as you know this. Because work is so hard and so dangerous and it's very fast pace that. These mass actually interfere with the work in the fields. And that had a house. What you know the the that he's an ass although they're you know there there Matt to prevent people from inhaling toxic fumes and toxic air. We really does it doesn't really allow workers to continue your cute. Be as productive as it could be and end in an otherwise normal circumstances.

Last sermon to preserve their safety you say it on is it sounds like you're saying they all aware of them. Because it's gonna slow them down what's your recommendation. Well under under united farm worker contracts we see that. There are. Companies that would actually shut down at provide employees with paid time ops that would be ideal for any employer. In agriculture. But unfortunately most most companies are allowed to these benefits so I'm oftentimes you CDs underpaid workers forced to work. Under these group. Unfortunate circumstances. Firm for several reasons. Because there's so underpaid they're sort of force to keep working under the sink and British opens. And because they're not really protected by. They're not really protected employees. They're afraid of being blacklisted. Or and there they don't want to be. Not loud come back to work if they decide is get the day's. A lot of a lot of these farmworkers welcome back to work it. By the horrors request is there a if there last year but the popular power not to say oh I'm not can continue working with. And hey you know ever as a reached out to OSHA in California who oversees. Sort of the good. General landscape of what's going on there and there they did explain that offends them they do send out advisories to employees and the workers to try to let them know once situations like this occur at the air quality is unsafe and so on and so forth. But we get asked about action being taken and they've made clear that they sort of rely on complaints to be made first. For them to come in and get involved we asked them if they've received any complaints about these notes they said. They would have to look into that so and it's so it doesn't sound like they receive very many if they still have to look into the at the moment. Yeah and there's so many reasons why that is number one most. Farmworkers in the country are working unfortunately. If are documented so there's there's there's this big cheer. The government agencies and contacting them to begin where it. I do think Jews. Most are. Workers don't know who to call so totally rely on local organizations they rely on united farmworkers to believe that the conduit to this information. And and that there's if you're under reporting hobby absolutes. Farm workers to these agencies. They're not gonna call and to file a complaint. And they're. This isn't enough information on tic you know finance it to do that. And let it at the very least right now employers should be requiring every employee suit to Wear protective gear. Aaron will hopefully by putting this out there we are helping at least a little bit you know these are the people making the food that we need to heat hopefully.

The NOAA wrote on its website that \"the number of violent incidents towards dolphins in the Northern Gulf have increased in recent years.\"\n\nAn NOAA spokesperson told ABC News the agency was aware of the reports that a dolphin had been shot in Manhattan Beach, but they would not comment on any potential or ongoing investigation."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: California wildfire latest", "description": "ABC News' Diane Macedo and ABC News Meteorologist Dan Peck give the latest updates on the deadly California wildfires.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/california-wildfire-latest-59301635", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/181119_abcnl_wildfire_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T22:28:47Z", "content": "Now Playing: California farm workers remain on the job despite poor air quality Now Playing: California wildfire latest Now Playing: Multiple victims injured in shooting near Chicago hospital, police say Now Playing: 'Dancing With The Stars' Finale tonight on\u2026 [+1096 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for California wildfire latest\n\nFires and within two or three days on have to prepare for Raines. They don't have time. To do that although cities are cleaning out some of the areas. Where the mud usually flows into there's some channels that they can clear out of debris just so they hopefully the mud can go in there are not affect homes. But again since is happening so quickly it's been a 12 punch of of those fires that literally today I think is when they're finally getting them completely under control. And now they have to prepare for the rain so they haven't have much of a chance to do that so the only thing they really have. By these sandbags and that's what they're going to be doing. Residents themselves are just getting these sandbags placing them around their homes trying to divert the mud. Away from homes and that's really all they can do right now since this is happening so quickly after the fires. And Carlos you then I mean you're from the area say do you not used to this kind of thing necessarily but you have seen things like this before. How does this fire in this situation and now this month's flood risk compare to some of the fire issues we've seen previously. Well it's it's frightening because every year we say the same thing we've never seen something like this before we've said that last year. With the fires in want to see go near Santa Barbara where the fires they're destroyed so many homes and then the mudslides. Literally what these boulders the size of a vehicles down the hill so much destruction and that was the worst we ever see now this one this fire is. The worst we've seen here in Southern California it seems every year they're getting worst. And that's what's so scary is because so much. An area was devastated by these fires are were very worried. That these mudslides could also be worse than they were last year last year was incredible mudslides that we had that cost so much destruction. Now we're certainly hope things did not see repeated that Clough has been an agrarian hills California coast. Get our thanks to the students behind you two were working hard to try to help the community and thank you for their reporting we appreciate it. And I want to bring back in the largest impact on this day and you heard Carlo saying that every year. We say we've never seen anything like it is the worst you've ever seen and it feels like every year were re topping and away we obviously don't wanna be twice that. One we were seeing a lot of factors at play on one of the biggest ones I think there is making these recent fire so compelling or where they're burning. We start to report about fires that are you know excluding California people think about it because that's also where they're burning the peace hit populated areas in Southern California. And you know areas where we have lots of friends lots of developments so we saw that really immediate this destruction but also see overall pattern in California. What's on as much temperature temperatures a factor but it's just that they've been very dry. We're always thank you several Tugnutt drought was about dry conditions we get those those wins the dry conditions and we seals fires you know exploding. But now the rain is on the way which you would think they're insane and ran into some degree they are I mean this is this doesn't think a lot of good news. To those trying to fight these fires however. The fire creates issues with the ground which then makes it vulnerable to mudslides yet once you get on to a heavier rainfall. Particular looks like this time around in northern California. Basically what happened was these wildfires change the composition of the soil. So those charred mountains now. Are basically no water repellent liar so once that rain falls and insanity going into the ground getting soaked up when we get these heavy rainfall rates that range I was just gonna run off the mountain. It's gonna create debris flows possibly mudslides has no roster Gus is gonna go downhill. And does that create a flooding risk as well it does it also increases the try to flush buddy and I should mention not just for these recent fires all the fires that we've seen in the last few years. They're still recovering. You know there's a lot of farmland to grab those areas are doesn't have to be just these two fires we have an increased risk for flooding and mudslides and is there anything they can be doing right now to try to prepare for this is really how much you can do it's in once the wind has burned. You really does need a natural process. To take over unfortunately years. For about to happen Graham unfortunately the people of California don't have said Dan. What can we look forward to present a lot of this will depend on how heavy rainfall is how much rain again. I think they're making personal beyond we have the rain moving into California early on Wednesday it's gonna first of all clear the air out which is gonna be good news for so many communities. There we're gonna get the rain initially being you know private wrapping up the containment on the fires now right along the West Coast been moving into inland locations. Tonight also want to mention to is this mother pattern change we start to get. The water the winds pushing off the Pacific Ocean in his overall change is gonna get colder too there's actually something else to bring up while we have the rain the most high risk. And when that doesn't have a home or in some of those ten community needs. In shelters it's actually been hit Chile because snow in the Sierra mountains in a man about forty semi to ourselves what my guess is you know what that. Many people are displaced straight out of their homes and like you said some of them living in tents at that actually could pose a pretty big problem for that area. I can't pack meteorologist with ABC we appreciate it thank you to all of the west front and reporters out there in the field who are helping us keep an eye.

Add Democratic Party as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Democratic Party news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nSixteen Democrats who've opposed Nancy Pelosi's quest to become speaker released a letter Monday saying they will vote for \"new leadership\" when the House picks its leaders in January, underscoring a significant threat to her effort to lead her party's House majority in the next Congress.\n\nThe letter's release suggests that rather than spending the next six weeks focusing on a fresh agenda to present to Americans, House Democrats could be consumed with a bitter and attention-grabbing internal leadership fight.\n\nThe battle pits the party's largely liberal and diverse membership backing Pelosi, D-Calif., against a small group of mostly moderate male lawmakers. Of the 16 Democrats who signed the letter \u2014 which stops short of explicitly saying they will vote for an opposing candidate for speaker \u2014 all but two are men: Reps. Kathleen Rice of New York and California's Linda Sanchez.\n\n\"We promised to change the status quo, and we intend to deliver on that promise,\" the authors wrote, referring to campaign pledges by a number of Democratic candidates. \"Therefore, we are committed to voting for new leadership in both our Caucus meeting and on the House Floor.\"\n\nPelosi has activated an aggressive campaign for the job involving House colleagues, prominent outside Democrats and party-aligned interest groups. Her office distributed endorsements Monday from nine House Democrats who are military veterans and UnidosUS, a Hispanic civil rights organization.\n\nKnown as a precise vote counter with a keen sense of her caucus' leanings, Pelosi is aided by the lack of a declared opponent and many weeks during which she can dangle choice committee assignments, rules changes and other goodies to help attract support.\n\n\"Leader Pelosi remains confident in her support among Members and Members-elect,\" spokesman Drew Hammill said in a written statement. He said 94 percent of House Democrats declined to sign the letter, though Pelosi opponents said they expect others who didn't sign to vote against her.\n\nThough the mavericks' numbers represent a handful of the 232 House Democrats elected, plus four races still undecided, they could still garner enough opposition to thwart her.\n\nPelosi seems certain to have enough support to become her party's nominee for speaker when House Democrats vote by secret ballot on Nov. 28. She will need only a majority of Democrats in that contest.\n\nBut when the full House elects its new leaders Jan. 3, the speaker will need a majority 218 votes, assuming that no one votes \"present\" or misses the vote and Republicans oppose her en masse, as seems likely. At 232 seats, Pelosi could afford to lose just 14 Democrats and still become speaker.\n\nThe rebels' letter to their Democratic colleagues praises Pelosi, 78, as \"a historic figure\" who helped win major victories. Pelosi was speaker from 2007 through 2010 when Democrats held the majority and has been the party's leader since 2003.\n\n\"We also recognize that in this recent election, Democrats ran and won on a message of change,\" they wrote. \"Our majority came on the backs of candidates who said that they would support new leadership because voters in hard-won districts, and across the country, want to see real change in Washington.\"\n\nPelosi's critics say the party's long-serving top leaders must make room for younger members. They say years of Republican ads portraying her as an out-of-touch liberal have made it hard for moderate Democrats to win in swing districts.\n\nPelosi allies counter that the party just won House control with their biggest gain of seats since the 1974 post-Watergate election. Many bristle at dumping her at a time when President Donald Trump and the #MeToo movement have helped attract female candidates and voters to the party.\n\nRep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland has been No. 2 House Democrat since 2003 and South Carolina's Jim Clyburn has been No. 3 since 2007. Both are in their late 70s and are running, unopposed so far, for those posts again.\n\nOf the letter's signees, five are incoming House freshmen or hope to be. Two of them \u2014 Anthony Brindisi of New York and Ben McAdams of Utah \u2014 are in races in which The Associated Press has yet to call a winner.\n\nPelosi critics assert there are more Democrats who've not signed the letter who are prepared to vote against Pelosi. That includes Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio, who's said she's considering running for speaker.\n\nTrump has tweeted his respect for Pelosi and offered to round up GOP votes to help elect her speaker. Pelosi's office has said she will win with Democratic votes, and it seems a stretch to expect Republicans to help elect her speaker \u2014 a vote that could open them up to primary challenges in 2020.\n\nOthers signing were incumbents Jim Cooper of Tennessee; Bill Foster of Illinois; Brian Higgins of New York; Stephen Lynch and Seth Moulton of Massachusetts; Ed Perlmutter of Colorado; Tim Ryan of Ohio; Kurt Schrader of Oregon and Filemon Vela of Texas. Incoming freshmen were Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, Max Rose from New York and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Multiple victims injured in shooting near Chicago hospital, police say", "description": "Multiple people, including a police officer, have been injured in a shooting near a Chicago hospital, according to police.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/multiple-victims-injured-shooting-chicago-hospital-police-59301554", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/181119_wabc_chicago_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T22:16:01Z", "content": "Now Playing: Florida yoga studio shooting Now Playing: New video of deadly police shooting Now Playing: Investigation into mass shooting in California is underway Now Playing: California wildfire latest Now Playing: Multiple victims injured in shooting near C\u2026 [+1052 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Multiple victims injured in shooting near Chicago hospital, police say\n\nBreaking story this when in Chicago where there are reports of a shooting inside a hospital.

That happy money to you welcome to the briefly remind Devin Dwyer ABC news in Washington great to have you with this we also have just official or White House producer here now he wrote in our senate producer with us today on. Some breaking news to kick off this holiday week the White House has just announced just coming in now. That they are dropping their effort to revoke the press pass of CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta. If you follow this story created waves just a couple weeks ago when the White House. Moved to revoke his badge that allowed him to enter White House grounds on account of this incident you're seeing right here. With White House intern the president which they said violated White House to quorum. It went back and forth in federal court Jim Acosta received his badge back on Friday. And now the White House says they are backing down just in this is a pretty rare. Moment of. Absolutely calm they we sort of had suspicions that they continue to fight this with the Costa and the idea was that they were gonna create new rules of the Korman and hold him accountable to those rules for his -- past actions and then start all over with this process again removing it they've backed down which is which is good news for all press but I do think. It it sends a signal strongly that you know that that. Journalists like Costa have to be on their toes and and and a certain level of the arm as expect. NL east that's intensity of Reading the briefs in this case it was an emergency motion was filed by CNN did today with the judge they were headed toward yet another. Clash in court. It did seem know by many legal scholars that the White House response over the weekend didn't hold a lot of water. Well look the White House was arguing that the federal judge had imposed this temporary restraining order to restore original cost as credentials. Arguing that he wasn't caught making a point on the case of the First Amendment merit saying that there is an inherent First Amendment right. Should be in the press office he was simply saying that Jim Acosta was not afforded. His fifth amendment rights and of course the White House said that no this actually vindicated their argument that there is no inherent right. To the First Amendment but it sure seems that you know this federal judge send that. Look there's no need for an emergency injunction here there's no need to hold this hearing now we've got the holidays coming up so it didn't really see that there was the urgency. Required to push this power. And I don't think guys that this by any means the White House is backing down and it came with Gemma costs I think we will see new steps that they will take. Thank the president to see evidence that he could walk away exactly right doesn't like the questions from Jim Acosta as we know he does not like to walk away. I mean come on do we want to see or anything can if you got to play to that but major development just coming in now from the White House meanwhile the president. Had quite an interview over the weekend with Fox News FOX News Sunday Chris Wallace. The president making a number of headline chief among them. That he is now disinclined. He says to sit down with special counsel Robert Mueller and answer questions under oath that is a significant development after. Months many months of the president saying he was eager to answer. Any of the special concerts questions let's bring in our White House producer Jordan Phelps has been tracking the story. From the White House Jordan. Oddly this sort of perk to the ears of a lot of watchers that this is a major milestone. In this back and forth between the president and special counsel in this all happening as he's now brought in a new attorney general. Yet the president saying and that interviewed Evers knows there is news on a number of fronts saying that he thinks he's now dying. With a smaller crowd and witches course isn't changed. From what the president told our Jon Karl just last year when he sank he'd be willing to sit down with Meyer a 100%. President now saying probably not so much but the big headline I took wait for. From that interview was at the president indicated that he would make no app for. To stop the new acting attorney general should he decide to rein in the smaller pro. I which of course it is something that. All of the president's critics are watching closely will this acting attorney general who may argue. Doesn't have the proper authority to be an acquisition will he try to stop them are proud and the president making graduate sop up. Right that would occur in the acting AG saying many times support got the job that he would move to perhaps he would recommend restricting it Robert Mahler. The president says he's fine with that Jordan the other thing that was in that interview the president. Are reiterating he's answered a whole host of questions from Robert Mahler two dozen or by our reporting on a number of topics and he's ready to submit them. What are you hearing from the White House today about whether they had here are ready to submit have submitted. And what are in those questions. DeVon president says he's finished answering those questions he says they are easy to answer and fact. And we expect them to be submitted sometime this week bedding towels we hear from molesting that they have been in hand. Hi a it's not a done deal at this point. Doesn't this seems like. Quite as significant juncture in the investigation because of either signals I think that we're headed quickly towards conclusion there Bob Mueller. Takes the written answers says thank you served finishes the report or. If it's not enough for Bob Mahler we could be headed for a fight over subpoenas and if only we can talk to Bob Muller an outlet he wanted to. I mean the the idea that you you might gather is that okay we'll he takes the questions and then does some for further cross examination of those answers to find out if he's you know. Else's it with what he says is matching up woods. With what other people are saying particularly about things like that trump tower meeting in what he knew ahead of time. Tom and I just go back to you know win when he says he's not going to talk to you to Bob Mueller remember what Bob Woodward in this book. That Ty Cobb told. That you know type that was in the room of the presence and further up the president's attorney former attorney Wright said I can't stand with you what you do this you're not capable of doing it all those around him told him not to do it of course. He seems to be taking that advice now meanwhile he's gotten rid of his. Problematic attorney general Jeff Sessions problematic in his view hired Matt Whitaker somebody sees as an ally. Alley Rogen and now we have this constitutional challenge. That seems to be coming down the tracks here three senate Democrats today filed lawsuits in federal court alleging that this appointment. Is not constitutional break that don't yes. Right White House Blumenthal and rhino are filing a lawsuit. Saying that it the appointment of Matt Whitaker to this position he was someone who served as sessions chief of staff before being appointed to the top job. It falls flies in the face of the appointments act which requires. The line of succession to be honored especially in the case of when. An attorney general or another principal officers fired so the president has more discretion to appoint someone when that person resigns. And in this case even though sessions technically resigned I mean it was sort of been resignation under arrest and then residents probably went in and said. Hey Jeff Sessions let me get your resignation letter and that has how it was submitted so that's the basis under which the lawsuits coming and joining. Cells Elizabeth white her she's with the constitutional accountability center she's help wean. Bring the lawsuit with those three Democrats to hold the president accountable. And her roads Elizabeth thanks so much for being here on British inside literally deeper into the reasoning behind this in the White House is arguing. That the vacancies act permits. The president to a point make this temporary appointment it's been done they say a 160 times. Over history. And you that you are contending here in court documents that this is simply. Not constitutional. Absolutely. And thanks so much for having me on today. You can talk about which statute. Means what but what we know Berkshire is that the constitution. Is the supreme law of the land. And here the constitution's appointments clause is very clear. When the president wants to install a principal officer. And there's no question that the office of the attorney general. It's a principle as a principal officer it's that important was important law enforcement office of the land. That the president must get. And so what these senators are doing is to vindicate that crucial check and balance that's in the constitution. By saying you know the president. Put Matthew Whitaker in this position it appears because. He has views that match more worth what the president thinks about important issues like similar investigation. And this is a situation where the founders wanted the senate to weigh in Alexander Hamilton who wrote about. How the reason why the constitution requires senatorial advice and consent is precisely so. Presidents would not put people Lynn who would serve their personal interest. Rather than the public interest you know you to basically put Matthew Whitaker in a way Aegon is exactly what Alexander Hamilton is concerned about. But isn't it true here Elizabeth that that there has been precedent on a temporary basis for. Individuals to be put into these positions. It until such time that a formal nomination can be made is till such time the senate can provide that advice and consent. It did do you really really see in this case that it's unconstitutional in a temporary basis given all the precedent that's out there. I think you know first call their the president about strong the president's office of legal counsel tried to put out this justification for Whitaker. Just last week that was. And frankly rather flimsy. Ands you know you look acts. The fact that brought Rosen Steen who is senate confirms he's available to be the acting attorney general. And you know it's incredibly important that the senators. Get to look at Matthew Whitaker a lot has been raised unfortunately about his qualifications. About questionable legal views even beyond what he said about the Moeller investigation. And this is eight while the suit is being brought by three democratic senators right now. It isn't a partisan issue we've seen scholars from across the ideological Specter. Including John you're one of perhaps the most infamous lawyers in the Bush Administration. Saying that this is unconstitutional. Including Justice Thomas. Who has opined in another case that. Any time you have a principal officer. Even Indies situations where might be temporary. You have to get the advice and consent of the senate so I think that. You know this is a suit being brought by democratic senators to vindicate the checks and balances of the constitution. And but it isn't a political issue it's about. The constitution. And we will see where that goes Elizabeth Smart for the constitutional credibility senator thank you so much we also know that there's this ethic is suit guys. Brought by the state of Maryland as wells has been challenged in a couple of fronts and we'll see. The president appoints someone else in the meantime perhaps to get the process moving. In the bottom I think it hasn't been hasn't played out in Korea before so this question has yet to be answered by a judge will find out coming down the pike moving on today here in the briefing room. Some big news coming out of the house US house up on Capitol Hill. As they goes house Democrats search for their new leader begin that process Nancy Pelosi today. Is facing some opposition that just got very real sixteen Democrats have now signed a letter put their name. On paper coming out against her selection as the next speaker of the house this is significant. In that this is this these people who put their names that have been rumored for days are now on the record guys. And we can't say enough to speaker of the house is one of the most critical positions in this town Alley. In the line of succession she wants it badly she is dug in and yet her party. Is putting up quite sure. Yes she is defiant that she's going to be the next speaker of the house she's been inviting in fact other challenger saying the water's warm because she is so confident that she's going to win now this new letter. Sixteen Democrats one of them actually looks like he's going to lose his reelection bout so it's really fifties teen but Nancy hello it is still exactly the threshold needed. That that would denying heard the speakership on the house floor. When the entire house sits down on January 3 to elect the speaker she needs 218 votes. Which means right now she can was fifteen people they say that they are thankful to her they call Harry historic figure but they note that. Ed this recent election was about a message of change in that there there majority came on the backs of candidates who said they wouldn't support and leadership and in fact a lot of people. Explicitly ran against policies another saying we have to abide by that promise however of course a big question is. Who can read the Bible. Tantamount to challenging you don't have a challenger has had seen and heard and that had a leader to pick and don't forget what could save her. President trump said he would favor president transit it's all about the vote on the floor with with Republicans as well forgot that president says he'll give her. Public and both Republicans quit absolutely love if Nancy Pelosi was the speaker again and so I think that's the double edged sword people now. What an experienced legislator she is but she they also know what a lightning rod she and her republic. Why is he doing that and why is the president offering to dig pluggable report once a secret that Nancy Pelosi is approval rating in favorability rating in the public guy is extremely low at 17%. In the latest CNN Paul. Operated independence in particular don't like Nancy Pelosi she's become this lightning rod of opposition whether you lover or hater for writer for Iran that's what she is Donald Trump loves a foil and he wants her in the game especially he has torn torn he thinks that he can campaign against Nancy Pelosi and would be good for him so hey. He can help Pelosi be speaker might help them out. Thought we shall see meanwhile. The Democrats. Majority in the house is growing they're up to 233. Seats by the latest ABC news count but the Republicans are picking up. More seats on the senate side over the weekend some big news coming out of Florida with two. Still. As yet undecided now decided races there have them resolve the Florida senate race they see their Rick Scott is the new senator Republican senator from Florida unseating. Bill Nelson after that recount battle. And in the gubernatorial race you saw Andrew gill on concede Toronto Santa CC and their former congressman. That was a brutal battle the president coming in for a Ron Desantis he's the new governor of Florida. It up in Georgia that governor's race also hotly contested it would have been historic. Stacey Abrams essentially gave guys a concession speech over the weekend to Brian cant you see here. Bridge you know George are getting purple. Alley but not quite there well Stacey Abrams has conceded in a technical sense although she would not over the weekend saying that it. That temp was the legitimate winner of that race she was citing a lot of inherent structural. Problems with that in a lawsuit she filed as well as ministers I'll see that yes says she's saying that yes he won the technical amount of votes needed to. Get you elected but not that he did so in a way that reflects a fair playing field. Her but in what we should say if you're watching us in thinking rob this campaign has just about over the recounts are done while this thing was that spurs are. There's still one more senate race to go in Mississippi Alley has been tracking it it is the only race. They'd raised its outstanding. Republican state Alley Republican has a slight edge there but surprisingly close. This is an incredible race and as you said the Florida and Georgia. Being wrapped up sort of allows us to put the spotlight directly in this race which has become very nasty. In the original race the two candidates a Republican incumbent who was appointed to the CCD Huntsman he had Smith and Mike STV Democrat. Are within or less of a percentage point on one another and their short of the 50%. Outright victory needed. To avoid a runoff so that race is headed towards a runoff November 27 that's. Yeah I think CXD after the president will be there and true stops on Monday. This is the problem overall the president has had with the selection yes he won seats in the senate. But these Democrats are getting really close and red states and that does not bode well for him for twenty. There's a few things that make this race as most recently as our very specific and that is that's in behind Smith. Facing very difficult Republican challenger who took away about fifteen points from par. And now it's become a wait closer race because of some of the hitting video as it came out. And revealing some of us and he hides that statements that I'm sure she didn't very controversial they have never seen this racist in many corners of first one which was may remember seconds and actually before the recent didn't come out. Until two weeks later she embraces and a supporter at a campaign rally and in praising the supporter he's she said quote if he invited me to a public can't hanging. I'd be on the front row and of course the use of the weren't hanging in the in Mississippi south SP is running to be the first African American. Senator in Mississippi since shortly after the civil war so those aren't. Those are words that he has. He has remarks as being racially insensitive. And this is not being any racetrack and race until now when these comments of Comerica also made another comment about. Sort of joking about election and voter suppression exactly so so these are some comments that she argues we're me off hand but it certainly. Tightening up the race and making a lot. To watch in Mississippi a state like Georgia where the dark path. Past of the south and racial discrimination looms large it's a recovery is definitely works worth watching ms. Johnson says the president. Headed their for not one but two campaign rallies the Monday after Thanksgiving and what happened here for you. On ABC news live but we are speaking of Thanksgiving and holidays marching that much closer toward Christmas time. At the White House and today we got a little sign of Christmas the Christmas tree the traditional national Christmas tree. Arrived in a carriage as per tradition there and as they were playing. Some Christmas carols sort of shocking that we're already hearing that there she is the First Lady the president actually coming out this year agreed to treat.

This is usually at this event to you rival the Christmas tree usually happens after Thanksgiving later than it did this here. In the White House is noted that they have to actually remove an entire chandelier to put this Christmas tree up. So maybe they got put the tree up while the first Stanley is down in my a lot of for Thanksgiving.

Thank stabbing you noted these turkeys are RE five months old neither wind. Will lose their wives and meet their fate of the Thanksgiving at table like so many millions of Turkey's around the country. I bet they have a few more months to live regardless because these turkeys were bred to be eaten. I hand the Virginia tech university professor are you gonna take these turkeys after tomorrow. Tells me that if they he lived to be here tops that's really guidance well I don't might not eyes see they end of their lives later this week but it's just a few.

William Pollard was awarded the French Legion of Honor during a ceremony at the Kentucky Capitol. Consul General of France Guillaume Lacroix pinned the medal on Pollard, calling him \"a true French hero.\"\n\n\"You owe so much to America's greatest generation,\" Lacroix said. \"The American people changed everything ... Without this gentleman, my flag would not be flying. It's as simple as that.\"\n\nPollard was 25 in 1944 when he landed on Omaha Beach, the code name for a portion of shoreline during the Allied invasion of German-occupied France. As was one of the first soldiers to arrive, his job was to deploy concrete caissons that would form a temporary harbor to help soldiers rapidly load cargo onto the beach.\n\nPollard's son, William Pollard Jr., said his father helped rescue 14 soldiers from a caisson after it was hit by enemy fire. Pollard said his father and a sergeant got the men safely to shore, having to coax some soldiers who were frozen with fear at the prospect of jumping into the 40-feet-deep (12-meter-deep) water.\n\nKentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes said her office assisted Pollard in receiving the award. She noted his career included advancing into Germany with Gen. George Patton. She said his career included a scalp wound, which was later patched by a nurse.\n\n\"You represent the best of Kentucky,\" Grimes said.\n\nIn a written statement read by his son, Pollard Sr. said he was honored to receive the award, thanking his late wife and the soldiers he served with.\n\n\"Today I am both happy and sad,\" he said. \"My thoughts today are with her and with my comrades from many years ago.\"\n\nThe Legion of Honor was founded in 1802 by Napoleon, the French emperor. Today, Guillaume said it can only be awarded by the country's elected president.\n\nPollard was born and raised in Lockport, Kentucky, a small town along the banks of the Kentucky River. He had an extensive military career, which also included running an orphanage in Korea near the end of the Korean War. Pollard Jr. said his father never spoke much about his war experience until 1994, during a trip to France to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Normandy invasion.\n\nHe said several people who knew his father said he should be nominated for the French Legion of Honor. He said it took about 15 months to get it approved.\n\n\"It's a wonderful culmination of a lot of my questioning,\" Pollard Jr. said."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Multiple victims injured in shooting near Chicago hospital, police say - ABC News", "description": "Multiple victims injured in shooting near Chicago hospital, police say ABC News Multiple people have been injured in a shooting near a Chicago hospital, according to police.

While that suggests a greater need for treatment, the one-third who did get help \u201ccarried out an attack anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, even getting mental health care is not the panacea people make it out to be.\u201d\n\nFor instance, James Holmes, who killed 12 people in an Aurora, Colo., theater in 2012, had been treated by a psychiatrist and spoken of homicidal thoughts. But he was not reported to authorities because he voiced no concrete plan.\n\nSeung-Hui Cho, whose mental problems dated to childhood, repeatedly talked to campus counselors two years before he killed 32 people and wounded 17 others at Virginia Tech University in 2007. Diagnosed with a mood disorder after threatening to harm himself in 2005, he was hospitalized overnight and ordered by a judge to receive outpatient treatment. But, mysteriously, he was not assessed or treated.\n\nOften, shooters\u2019 propensity for violence is easier to see in hindsight.\n\nSix months before the shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, police responded to a 911 call about yelling and banging coming from inside the house where Long, the alleged shooter, was living with his mother. They found an \u201cirate\u201d young man acting \u201cirrationally\u201d and called in a mental health crisis team. The social workers on that team evaluated and concluded there were no grounds to place him under a psychiatric hold.\n\nIt is unclear whether the officers were told of his history as a machine gunner in Afghanistan, which after the shooting led to speculation he might have had post-traumatic stress disorder. Only later did it emerge that Long had allegedly assaulted a track coach in high school.\n\nCalifornia allows authorities to place people on a 72-hour hold to evaluate their mental states \u2014 a practice similar to that in many states. But the standard for such holds, known in California as a \u201c5150,\u201d is quite high, said Dr. Garen Wintemute, an emergency physician who heads the University of California Firearm Violence Research Center at UC-Davis.\n\nTo be held, a person must pose a serious imminent threat to themselves or others or be so gravely disabled that they can\u2019t take care of themselves, he said. The law does not take substance abuse into account, Wintemute said.\n\n\u201cA 5150 involves taking a person into custody sometimes against their will,\u201d Wintemute said. \u201cThat\u2019s not something that\u2019s done lightly.\u201d\n\nDr. E. Fuller Torrey, the psychiatrist who founded the Treatment Advocacy Center 20 years ago, long has argued that society needs to be more forceful in getting care for the severely disturbed \u2014 and requiring it when necessary \u2014 to prevent suicide, mass shootings and other violence.\n\nHis goal is to get more state legislatures to pass bills like Kendra\u2019s Law in New York and Laura\u2019s Law in California that allow judges to order mentally ill people into outpatient treatment. His organization helped draft both those bills and has helped win passage of similar laws in at least 16 states. In California and some other states, however, the reach of the law is limited by whether counties decide to implement the approach.\n\nDuwe takes no position on the idea of mandated treatment but said that doing so to prevent events that happen only a few times a year makes little sense. \u201cMass public shootings are more commonplace than they ought to be, but they are still too infrequent to design policies based on addressing such rare events,\u201d he said.\n\nGun laws that exclusively target people with mental health histories also make little sense, said Drs. James Knoll and George Annas, psychiatry professors at SUNY Upstate Medical Center, in a 2016 article in Psychiatry Online.\n\nThey \u201cwill be extremely low yield, ineffective, and wasteful of scarce resources,\u201d they wrote.\n\nWintemute argued that other strategic interventions may work better. He advocates fixing problems in the nationwide system of background checks, which requires firearm dealers to verify with the FBI that a purchaser isn\u2019t a felon, fugitive, domestic abuser or dangerously mentally ill.\n\nHe said flaws in the law include the fact that private sales, including those at gun shows, are exempt; only federal, but not state, agencies are required to submit data to the background-check database; and thousands of cases of violence by military service members \u2014 including that of a shooter who killed 26 people in a Texas church in 2017 \u2014 are not reported.\n\nWintemute also helped draft a California law that took effect in 2016 that allows family members or law enforcement officials to seek a temporary restraining order barring a potentially violent person from purchasing guns and removing any already in their possession.\n\nThese so-called gun violence restraining orders don\u2019t involve a mental health assessment, Wintemute said, but are designed to let family members temporarily get guns away from a relative at risk of doing harm, including suicides. The order can last up to three weeks and can be extended for up to a year after a hearing, in which the gun owner can ask a judge to return the weapon.\n\nIn California, 190 orders were issued through the end of last year, Wintemute said, results he described as disappointing. Numbers for this year have not yet been compiled, but Wintemute said they are growing. So far, 13 states have passed similar laws, beginning with Connecticut in 1999. Eight, including Florida, approved them in the aftermath of the Parkland shooting, and Florida has already issued 450 such orders, Wintemute said.\n\nPhysicians can play a key role by asking patients and family members if they own guns and encouraging the family to seek a gun order if they\u2019re worried, Wintemute added.\n\n\u201cIf physicians are willing to see this as \u2018If you see something, say something,\u2019 and bring it to families\u2019 attention, we could decrease rates of suicide and possibly mass shootings,\u201d he said.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Police say a female officer and three male officers from the Lakewood police department were working on their lap tops while sitting in a Booth at a coffee shop.

Employees inside the coffee shop at the time were left alone and watched in horror as the gunman then ran out. They weren't even on the job going anyone over that is you know trying to have their morning cup coffee and someone comes in and as a life.

If a Russian is elected as its new president, it could encourage Moscow to intensify attempts to hunt down its critics abroad.\n\nThe new charges leveled against Browder accuse him of forming a criminal group to embezzle funds in Russia. They also alleged that he could be behind the death of his employee, Sergei Magnitsky, in a Russian prison.\n\nMagnitsky, a 37-year-old lawyer who alleged he had uncovered $230 million in tax fraud by Russian officials, died in 2009 while in pre-trial detention. A Russian presidential commission concluded he had been beaten and denied medical care, and two prison doctors were charged with negligence leading to his death; one was acquitted and the other went free because the statute of limitations had expired.\n\nBrowder mounted an international campaign to bring Magnitsky's killers to justice, and in 2012, the U.S. Congress passed the Magnitsky Act that imposed travel and financial sanctions on top Russian officials, including prosecutors. Several other countries have since adopted similar legislation.\n\nBrowder, who had owned a major investment fund in Russia before he was barred entry to the country, was convicted in absentia in Russia on charges of tax evasion and funneling money overseas in both 2013 and again last year, and sentenced to nine years in prison.\n\nOn Monday, Mikhail Alexandrov of the Russian Prosecutor General's Office told reporters that they have opened a criminal case into the poisoning of three people described as associates of Browder, saying it was \"highly likely\" that Magnitsky was poisoned as well with the same military-grade substance.\n\nBrowder has blamed Russian prison officials for Magnitsky's death and dismissed the new charges against him as a sham. He told The Associated Press that he has no relation to the three men named by the prosecutors and described the accusations of poisoning as an attempt to discredit his campaign for justice for Magnitsky.\n\nPutin's \"reaction is so absurd that it only helps our campaign and our cause,\" he said.\n\nThe Russian prosecutors said they decided to pursue the new charges against Browder after reviewing evidence submitted by Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. and members of his father's presidential campaign in 2016 and who lobbied for the repeal of the Magnitsky Act. That meeting at Trump Tower occurred in June 2016 after the younger Trump was told by an intermediary that she represented the Russian government and was offering Moscow's help defeating Hillary Clinton. Emails later released by Trump Jr. show that she had been described as a \"Russian government attorney.\"\n\nThe timing of the new charges against Browder comes as the Netherlands is preparing to host diplomats from all European Union member states to discuss a pan-EU Magnitsky Act.\n\nBut the charges also come two days before Interpol's general assembly, meeting in Dubai, is expected to elect its new president, and one of the front-runners is Alexander Prokopchuk, who holds the rank of general in the Interior Ministry, which runs the police force. The officer had headed Interpol's Russian bureau before taking the job of Interpol's vice president in 2016.\n\nPutin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters Monday that the Kremlin is \"rooting for the Russian candidate and we would like the Russian candidate to win this election.\"\n\nInterpol works as a clearinghouse for national police services that are hunting down suspects outside their borders, issuing \"red notices,\" or alerts that identify a person wanted by another country.\n\nWhile its charter explicitly proclaims its neutrality, the organization has faced criticism that governments have abused the \"red notice\" system to go after political enemies and dissidents.\n\nTwo years ago, Interpol introduced measures aimed at strengthening the legal framework around the red notice system. As part of the changes, an international team of lawyers and experts first check a notice's compliance with Interpol rules and regulations before it goes out. Interpol also says it enhanced the work of an appeals body for those targeted with red notices.\n\nBrowder noted the timing of the announcement of the new charges against him and the Interpol election, tweeting: \"On the eve of Interpol deciding whether a Russian official should be president of Interpol, the Russian prosecutor's office holds a huge press conference about me and how they will chase me down anywhere in the world.\"\n\nAt the news conference, prosecutors said they will be placing Browder on Interpol's wanted list and they expect its cooperation.\n\nRussia has previously tried to get Browder placed on the wanted list, but the body has rejected the efforts, viewing his prosecution as politically motivated. He was briefly detained in Spain in May but released after police found that the arrest warrant for him was no longer valid.\n\nBrowder said Prokopchuk's possible appointment \"puts the organization in a grave danger of being fully discredited.\"\n\nOther Kremlin critics also have raised alarm about the possible politicization of Interpol.\n\nOpposition leader Alexei Navalny, who has faced a flurry of detentions and criminal charges, tweeted Monday that his associates \"have suffered abuse\" from Interpol officials who were complying with Russian warrants to persecute Kremlin opponents.\n\n\"I don't think that a president from Russia will help to reduce such violations,\" he said on Twitter.\n\nSimilar concerns surfaced when the previous Interpol president, Meng Hongwei, was named because he was a senior security official in the Chinese government. China has also been accused of trying to use Interpol for political ends. Meng is now detained in China as part of a sweeping purge against allegedly corrupt or disloyal officials.\n\nAsked about the upcoming vote at Interpol in connection with the Browder case, Prosecutor General's Office spokesman Alexander Kurennoy told reporters that Moscow views the organization as \"trusted partners\" and expressed hope that \"the procedures will be followed in a regular manner\" when it submits an arrest warrant for Browder."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Luke Barr", "title": "Military, border patrol called out to stop migrant 'rush' but it was a false alarm", "description": "The CPB said migrants in Tijuana were planning to cross at San Ysidro.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/military-border-patrol-called-stop-migrant-rush-false/story?id=59296449", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/san-ysidro-border-01-rtr-jc-181119_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T20:33:47Z", "content": "The port of entry in San Ysidro, California, was briefly closed early Monday after immigration authorities said they had received reports that members of a migrant \"caravan\" were gathering in Tijuana and planning to \"rush\" the border.

Using high-tech scans and some other tricks, scientists are learning how those sandpapery tongues help cats get clean and stay cool.\n\nThe secret: Tiny hooks that spring up on the tongue \u2014 with scoops built in to carry saliva deep into all that fur.\n\nA team of mechanical engineers reported the findings Monday, and say they're more than a curiosity. They could lead to inventions for pets and people.\n\n\"Their tongue could help us apply fluids, or clean carpets, or apply medicine\" to hairy skin, said Georgia Tech lead researcher Alexis Noel, who is seeking a patent for a 3D-printed, tongue-inspired brush.\n\nCats are fastidious, spending up to a quarter of their waking hours grooming. Noel's interest was piqued when her cat, Murphy, got his tongue stuck in a fuzzy blanket. Scientists had long thought cat tongues were studded with tiny cone-shaped bumps. Noel, working in a lab known for animal-inspired engineering, wondered why.\n\nFirst, CT scans of cats' tongues showed they're not covered in solid cones but in claw-shaped hooks. They lie flat and rear-facing, out of the way until, with a twitch of the tongue muscle, the little spines spring straight up, she explained.\n\nThe big surprise: Those spines contain hollow scoops, Noel found. Turning to zoos and taxidermists for preserved tongues to examine, she found bobcats, cougars, snow leopards, even lions and tigers share that trait.\n\nWhen Noel touched the tips of preserved spines \u2014 called papillae \u2014 with drops of food dye, they wicked up the liquid. A housecat's nearly 300 papillae hold a small amount of saliva that's released when the tongue presses on fur, and then they wick up some more.\n\nThe tongue's surface is wetter. But Noel saw clues that the spines were key to deep cleaning.\n\nPapillae were only slightly longer in lions than in housecats, although larger felines' bigger tongues hold many hundreds more, Noel and Georgia Tech associate professor David L. Hu reported in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nNext, Noel measured cat fur, which holds lots of air to insulate like a down jacket. Sure enough, compress that fur and in numerous types of cat, the distance to the skin matches the length of the tongue's spines, she found. An exception: Persian cats with their super-long fur that veterinarians caution must be brushed daily to avoid matting.\n\nA machine that mimicked the strokes of a cat's grooming found saliva from the tongue's surface alone simply can't penetrate as deep. And a thermal camera showed as they groomed, evaporating saliva cooled the cats.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

It's especially doable if a company can be a drawing card that helps boost local commerce or has significant job creation plans. The key is often to look for real estate in an area that needs an economic boost.\n\nEven the smallest and newest businesses may be able to negotiate, says Seth Kaplowitz, who teaches real estate courses at San Diego State University. For example, a young doctor or dentist willing to start a practice in an area that needs more medical or dental services may be able to get financial help in buying and/or setting up an office.\n\nSmall businesses can also band together and negotiate as a bloc, Kaplowitz says.\n\n\"They can say, 'this is what we're bringing to the downtown. What can you do to help us?'\" he says.\n\nAmazon, which plans headquarters in New York's Long Island City section and Arlington, Virginia, each employing 25,000 people, won a promise from New York officials for at least $2.8 billion in tax credits and grants and expects $573 million in breaks from Virginia. Amazon, which is moving into a formerly industrial boat basin in New York, pledged money to fund job training programs for public housing residents, provide space for a new school and pay into a city fund that will be used for projects that benefit the community, Mayor Bill de Blasio says.\n\nWhen businesses that cater to consumers are looking to rent, they can get favorable leasing terms and help with renovations and repairs if they have an attractive or unique brand that's likely to draw shoppers or other businesses to a neighborhood or small shopping center. A retailer or service provider who offers \"something nobody else has in the neighborhood\" will appeal to a landlord, Kaplowitz says.\n\nOwners are also likely to get a better deal in a neighborhood that's been depressed but is showing signs of turning around.\n\nBut even companies that cater to other businesses can get a deal. If they are willing to rent in a building that's sat empty for some time, landlords are likely to make more concessions.\n\nOwners need to first figure out if they want to buy or rent. If they're interested in buying, they should consider if the business is likely to outgrow a property within a few years? And if it does, is it feasible to add on to the space?\n\nOwning a building means being responsible for its upkeep. Does the owner have the time or available staffers to deal with maintenance and emergencies? And financial resources for unexpected expenses like damage from severe weather?\n\nDoes the business have predictable or stable cash flow? If it does, buying may be best, Kaplowitz says.\n\n\"If you're going to be around for a while, you want to own,\" he says. \"If you're willing to wait out the up and down cycles, ownership is the way to travel.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor more small business news, insights and inspiration, sign up for our free weekly newsletter here: http://discover.ap.org/ssb\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

Its surrounding area has been the scene of recent attacks and airstrikes, though fighting has eased in recent days.\n\nThe British-drafted resolution also calls on the parties \"to cease all attacks on densely populated civilian areas across Yemen\" \u2014 and to halt missile and drone attacks \"against regional countries and maritime areas.\"\n\nSecurity Council diplomats said negotiations on the draft are scheduled on Tuesday.\n\nKuwait's U.N.

The Saudi-led coalition allied with the government has been fighting the Houthis since 2015.\n\nSaudi-led airstrikes have hit schools, hospitals and wedding parties and killed thousands of Yemeni civilians.

He also called for a humanitarian cease-fire around key aid facilities, delivery of humanitarian and commercial imports to all Yemeni ports and onward to their final destinations, and funding to pay Yemeni pensioners and civil servants.\n\nThe draft resolution calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Hodeida governorate and to missile and drone attacks and for all bureaucratic roadblocks to the delivery of humanitarian aid to be removed within two weeks.\n\nDavid Beasley, head of the U.N. World Food Program, visited Yemen last week and told the Security Council on Friday that as many as 12 million of the 28 million Yemenis \"are just one step away from famine.\"\n\nTo avert that, Beasley said, the international community must combine increased humanitarian funding with \"an all-out effort to restore the Yemeni economy,\" which has collapsed.\n\nThe draft resolution calls on Yemen's government with support of the international community \"to deliver a larger and faster injection of foreign currency into the economy\" and to expedite credit for traders and payments to pensioners and civil servants within one month.

In September, the Pentagon canceled a remaining pot of $300 million bound for Pakistan, bringing the total in military assistance cuts to $800 million this year.\n\n....We no longer pay Pakistan the $Billions because they would take our money and do nothing for us, Bin Laden being a prime example, Afghanistan being another.

Very violent very vicious and terrible why he didn't listen to it. He Penney asked his advisors that they would recommend he listened to that recording they said no they would brief him on.

Residences states you know will be a report this week aren't we'll see and the president's also making headlines for some comments he made. About the general who directed B Osama bin Laden raid what's happening there.

So, my dear, you you have a new show, \"I love you, America\" which is very much the kumbaya, right, trying to find out what the other side is thinking, right? You go into trump country. Yeah, I mean, we do pieces where, you know, I had a family dinner with a very conservative Republican family and, you know, we always leave thinking -- oh, there they are. Oh wow. Yeah. Thinking the same thing, like, oh, they're pretty -- I loved them. They're nice, you know. We don't think we change each other's minds particularly except for about each other and being able to get along. But I also speak truth to power. I'm opinionated and the monologues are pretty -- I distinguish between the liars and the lied to. You know? That's a good way to put it. I don't like liars and I don't feel like I need to be open, but um, the lied to are -- I have compassion for. You also say that you're grateful for trump. I am grateful for trump. Well, it was Thanksgiving. I think there's a lot to be grateful for in terms of what he's caused which is more women than ever running for office and being elected for office, to muslims to indigenous Americans, lesbian mom -- Like a monsoon causes more boats to be built. The pendulum swing the other way and also the fact that -- sorry, I missed that and it was funny. Happens all the time. But he's forced us to -- he's taught us that democracy is not something to take for granted, it's something that has to be protected every day. For that, I'll be grateful. He gave himself an a-plus rating by the way. Do you agree with that? No. He would like it to have been even higher. Is anything higher? He's absolutely bizarre and fascinating if it wasn't so infuriating that he hurts people. Right. And their lives. I love that you're going out and getting to know people that are different from you. Maybe it would help people get along better or at least have conversations more. Yeah. It's healthy, really healthy. It's easy when we don't say terrible things to people, you know. That's true. I mean, you know, I'm guilty of it too. It's a practice. It's not like -- I'm not all kumbaya. You have to do it every day. You have to train yourself not to jump to the conclusion but to, like, meander to it as opposed to going, oh, that's what it is. Say, no, what is it? And you put it beautifully so -- I think of the show as like for me about Mr. Rodgers which, you know, very blue, very crass, Mr. Rodgers for adults but what are we, we're kids plus time. All these things, you know, we think of governments as grownups, they're messed up people with daddy issues and ego problems who haven't looked inward, and we suffer from it. Maybe they should all have psycho therapy before they can run for office. 100%. It's crazy that that's not a thing. Can we move to something very happy? Yes, please. You got a star on the walk of fame. Congratulations. Thank you. Wonderful. Look at you, how glamorous. Oh, that's great. What's the best part of that? Very inexpensive dress, yeah, I got it online. Stop staring, that's the name of it. I wear them all the time. They're fantastic. They fit tatas. Yeah, they're for women with boobs. What was the best part about winning it? Well, I'm right next to Mr. Rodgers. Are you really? Yeah. That's great. I couldn't believe it that forever I get to be his neighbor. He is the man that taught me that there's -- that I'm the only one in the whole world qualified to be me. And that I deserve love just as I am. And I'm grateful for that. I got into him more in high school. Really? That's a little late. In high school I would watch \"Sesame street\" and Mr. Rodgers before school and I saw it in a whole new way and I was moved by it. I miss him more than ever now, honestly. Me too. We have to talk about your new movie because it was so much fun, like I'm listening to you and I'm listening to vanellope. Oh yeah. She's all the way up. All the way up. Such a great character, and you said one of the reasons you were so interested in it is because she empowers girls. I think we have a clip and then I want to chat with you about it. She's coming up right behind us. Oh, hello. I believe you have something of mine? Yeah, come and get it. ??? ??? Aaah! This girl can drive. That was such a great scene, and how much of the character is based on you? I mean, can you drive like that? Yeah. No, I'm not a good driver. Yeah, she slowly became me. The first one, the first sketches were like this freckled red-headed kid and slowly she had a ponytail and then she, you know, was -- she just became -- had black eyebrows. It was so cool. And you know, they've got like little cameras in the resays of the room when you're recording that I'm never aware of. Then when you see the movie, she's got my, like, weird ticks and physical movements. It's so bizarre. That was the pretend recording session where they dress you up in nice clothes. Although John C. Reilly is always in a three-piece suit. He came here in one last week. I can't even handle him, he's so cute. Vanellope though is my type of princess and I think for so many girls -- listen, sweatpants isn't perfect all the time. The internet went crazy when a clip was released, a trailer, where vanellope is talking to the other traditional princesses. How did that unfold? I loved that Disney was game to do this. Look at that. Slip her a shoe. And all the tropes that Disney was partially responsible for creating, the tiny waist, the saved by a -- damsel in distress, saved by a man, the very whiteness of it, you know, and they grew and learned and changed and progressed and became inclusive and more Progressive and now, look at this 9-year-old little jewish kid with an attainable waist and comfortable clothes who's a Disney princess. Sarah, before we go, I want you to briefly tell us what was the great advice someone gave you when you were a young comedian. Someone gave you good advice. Do you remember? You're saying that sarcastically. No, I don't know what it is. Advice you regret saying. Someone said you got good advice. I'm asking what was it? It wasn't good advice. When I started in stand-up, the line was you're only -- if you're going to be a woman, you have to talk about things that men can relate to. You can't talk about things that only women can relate to because, yes, there are women in the audience but they're on dates and they only laugh if the boy -- if the guy laughs. Oh.

Human rights award. First and foremost, thank you to ABC for giving me these two days off to go to the house of commons to accept this award on behalf of my father. I'll give everyone a tiny lesson. This is a picture of sergei magnetski. He was a lawyer who fought for human rights in Russia and he exposed corruption in Russia by Vladimir Putin. He was subsequently tortured and killed in 2009. The ten-year anniversary of his death was two days ago. What it does, we have it here in the United States. My father fought for it very hard and it authorizes the U.S. Government to sanction people in Russia for human rights offenders and freezes their assets and stops them from coming into the United States. So it's basically protecting us from the bad guys in Russia from coming here. Bill bratter who is the lawyer -- I don't know if we have a picture of him -- now goes around and en acts it Bradley. Why this is important, the spy who met with Donald Trump Jr. Was petitioning to have this act removed. This is a picture of me with Vladimir Kaz amora. He was poisoned twice, fighting for freedom in Russia. Again, poisoned twice. He's a dissident and outspoken critic and he was a pal bearer at my father's funeral. I and many Americans continue to believe that the clear and present threat of Vladimir Putin and his global expansion is a threat to democracy, not only here in the United States but abroad. I think if we've learned anything from the last election it is that it is important that we stand by human rights, that we stand by democracy, that we don't let Vladimir Putin use democracy as some kind of slush fund while taking money from Russian taxpayers, while at the same time torturing people, killing them, putting them in jail for speaking out publicly and any kind of rights that we have in this country. Can I ask you a question? I'm getting on my soap box. How did they feel at this event about the fact that trump is very friendly with Putin? Everyone is concerned about the trump tower meeting with people and I don't want to say too much. \"The Washington post\" said it was a collective meeting of Putin's enemies. I'm proud to continue my father's legacy and be an enemy of Putin. Some of us have to speak out since people in the white house seem to think that getting cozy with Putin is something that's going to be okay. We have to be a beacon of hope globally for democracy. He's committed to the extermination of the west. I believe it's a clear and present threat to the united States of America and sergei magnetski should be on everyone's lips and we should continue fighting for what he believed in.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Putin mulls Russian response to US exit from nuclear pact", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has gathered top military officials to discuss a response to the planned U.S. withdrawal from a key nuclear arms pact", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/putin-mulls-russian-response-us-exit-nuclear-pact-59296855", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_76fc60818c824968a06e9b6e4664b8fa_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T18:52:47Z", "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has gathered his top military officials to discuss a response to the planned U.S. withdrawal from a key nuclear arms pact.

So just know that we're with you. But as you also may know, you know who toured the wildfires and said this. Take a look. I was with the president of Finland and he said we're a forest nation. He called it a forest nation. And they spend a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things and they don't have any problem. And when it is, it's a very small problem. Actually, as you probably know, Finland has a very different atmosphere. They get rain periodically. California, it doesn't rain much so raking really isn't going to help. You know, just being realistic. And the Finnish president said he never suggested raking, you know. I don't know why the new guy just won't acknowledge that if you don't have any rain, raking everything out is fine but if everything's dry and -- or someone drops a cigarette or someone lights the fire or, you know, some spark happens, stuff's going to burn. Raking it is not going to really help. So I would like him to stop with this raking stuff. Where did he get the raking though? He says it was -- He makes up stuff. Like where did it come from? I have some -- Also, when did he become an expert on forest fires? Who is he, smokey the bear all of a sudden? It's amazing, I have some really good friends that are from Finland and the fins are having such a ball with this. There are memes online with them vacuuming the forest. My friend is sending me all this stuff but in a sense we've almost become the laughing stock in so many places. He is. He is. And it's just so embarrassing because if you know anything about Finland, it rains like half the year. It's really cold. That's the point. There's moisture. They don't have -- they've some forest fires because of climate change. Climate change? It makes me sad that it takes the focus away from what's actually going on in California. You're talking about people in Finland laughing when the camp fire has been burning more than ten days, taken 77 lives, destroyed thousands of homes and structures. I think it's only halfway done. It won't be done until November 30. If you see photos of these neighborhoods, everything is burned to the ground. There are 1,000 people still missing. Yeah. Don't try and rationalize crazy talk. Where is he getting the raking from? I have no idea. I've been to many forests as have you and you can't clean up all the leaves in the forest. This is when I exit out because it's not rational and I'm not going to have a conversation about something that's completely irrational. And you can't talk about him every day. The issues that we talked about last segment, like what you're saying, like, I don't know when he became smokey the bear. I don't know the answer to that. What I need him to do is shut up. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. And I try not to be -- you know, I try not to be too rude, but you know what, people lost their lives. Yeah. Families lost their homes. This is not a joke. Raking -- I'm sorry. Raking is not funny to people in California. This is not cute, you know, this idea. And if you don't know this, if you really don't know this, man, everybody needs to start rethinking what you're saying and how you're saying it because you sure don't give a damn about the people in California. You know, whoopi, this is -- what he said was unbelievable. I shouldn't use the word bear anymore. As big as they look on the tube, you don't really see what's going on until you come here, says trump. And what we saw at pleasure -- not paradise, pleasure, what a name right now, he goes. What we just saw, we just left pleasure. Someone says to him, it's paradise, California. Oh yeah, paradise. He doesn't even know the name of the place. What is the matter with him? I just want him to stop talking in California. People are dying. People died. People lost everything. Listen, if you're not going to help, stay home.

Ghosn is of French, Brazilian and Lebanese background and lives in both France and Japan.\n\nNissan said Ghosn, 64, and another senior executive, Greg Kelly, were accused of offenses involving millions of dollars that were discovered during a monthslong investigation set off by a whistleblower. Kelly was also arrested.\n\n\"Beyond being sorry I feel great disappointment, frustration, despair, indignation and resentment,\" Saikawa said, apologizing for a full seven minutes at the outset of a news conference.\n\nYokohama-based Nissan Motor said it is cooperating with prosecutors in their investigation.\n\nSaikawa said Nissan's board will vote Thursday on dismissing Ghosn and Kelly, whom he described as the mastermind of the alleged abuses.\n\n\"This is an act that cannot be tolerated by the company,\" he said. \"This is serious misconduct.\"\n\nSaikawa said three major types of misconduct were found: underreporting income to financial authorities, using investment funds for personal gain and illicit use of company expenses.\n\nHe said that because of the continuing investigation, he could not disclose many details. But he promised to tighten internal controls, saying the problems may have happened because too much power was concentrated in one person.\n\n\"We need to really look back at what happened, take it seriously and take fundamental countermeasures,\" he said.\n\nGhosn officially still leads the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance as CEO and chairman. But experts said it is unlikely he will be able to stay on there or at Renault, where he is also CEO. Renault said its board will hold an emergency meeting soon.\n\n\"The last thing one of the world's biggest automakers needs is the disruption caused by an investigation into the behavior of a man who has towered over the global auto sector,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in London.\n\nThe companies in the alliance own parts of each other and share investments in new technologies, among other things. Renault owns 43 percent of Nissan, which owns 15 percent of Renault and 34 percent of Mitsubishi.\n\nRenault SA stock plunged more than 8 percent in France. Japanese markets had already closed when the scandal broke.\n\nGhosn was at Nissan for 19 years and signed a contract this year that would have run through 2022. His compensation, high by Japanese standards, has been a source of controversy over the years.\n\nAccording to NHK and the Kyodo News Service, Nissan paid Ghosn nearly 10 billion yen ($89 million) over five years through March 2015, including salary and other income, but he reported receiving only about half that amount.\n\nThe allegations are a serious blow at a time when Nissan is still getting over a scandal in which it admitted altering the results of emission and fuel economy tests on vehicles sold in Japan.\n\nGhosn is credited with helping bring about a remarkable turnaround at Nissan, resuscitating it from near bankruptcy by cutting thousands of jobs and shutting plants. His triumph made him something of a national hero in a country where foreign CEOs of major Japanese companies are relatively rare.\n\nHe also looms large in France, where he previously turned Renault around and made it into a global player, notably in electric vehicles. He led the French carmaker through major job cuts and an expensive and contentious bailout, earning the nickname \"Le Cost Cutter.\"\n\nGhosn became a nemesis of French unions and left-wing politicians, who saw him as a symbol of capitalism's excesses, particularly its rich executive pay packages.\n\nRenault shareholders in 2016 voted against Ghosn's pay package as too generous, but the board ignored the move.\n\nThat angered then-President Francois Hollande. Hollande's socialist government imposed limits on executive pay at state-run companies and tried to do the same in the private sector but backed down amid concerns such action would scare away foreign investment.\n\nGhosn served as Nissan's chief executive from 2001 until last April. He became chief executive of Renault in 2005, leading the two major automakers simultaneously. In 2016, he became Mitsubishi Motors' chairman.\n\nSaikawa said the scandal was a \"negative outcome of the long regime of Mr. Ghosn.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMari Yamaguchi in Tokyo and Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nYuri Kageyama is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nOn Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Cruise ship death remains mystery", "description": "The woman who died on a cruise ship has been identified but authorities haven't released many details about the incident.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/video/cruise-ship-death-remains-mystery-59295487", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/181119_abcnl_oquendo_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T18:49:14Z", "content": "Now Playing: Woman possibly pushed to death on cruise ship identified Now Playing: Woman falls off upper deck of cruise ship to her death Now Playing: Cruise ship death remains mystery Now Playing: Teddy bear care, pardoned turkeys and World Toilet Day: World\u2026 [+1136 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Cruise ship death remains mystery\n\nWhat about of that mystery on a cruise ship an American woman is now dead as the FBI tries to figure out if she was murdered.

Add Thanksgiving as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Thanksgiving news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nAs Americans prepare to cook and consume nearly 50 million turkeys on Thanksgiving Day, an ongoing outbreak of salmonella poisoning linked to the poultry means food safety at home is more critical than ever.\n\nFederal health officials have identified no single source of the outbreak of Salmonella Reading, which has sickened at least 164 people in 35 states during the past year.\n\nAs of Nov. 5, the bacterial strain has led to 63 hospitalizations and, in California, one death.\n\nMany who fell ill reported preparing or eating such products as ground turkey, turkey parts and whole birds. Some had pets who ate raw turkey pet food; others worked at turkey processing plants or lived with someone who did.\n\nLate Thursday, Jennie-O Turkey Store Sales LLC of Barron, Wis., recalled more than 91,000 pounds of raw ground turkey products that may be connected to the illnesses.\n\nThere is no U.S. requirement that turkeys or other poultry be free of salmonella \u2014 including antibiotic-resistant strains like the one tied to the outbreak \u2014 so prevention falls largely to consumers.\n\nThat means acknowledging that the Thanksgiving turkey you lug home from the grocery store is likely contaminated, said Jennifer Quinlan, an associate professor in the Nutrition Sciences Department at Drexel University.\n\n\u201cThey absolutely should assume there\u2019s a pathogen,\u201d she said.\n\nLast year, right after the holiday season, Quinlan and her colleagues surveyed more than 1,300 U.S. consumers about their turkey-handling habits. Most, they found, fail to follow safe practices, despite decades of public health warnings.\n\nNinety percent of those surveyed washed raw birds in the sink, even though that can spread dangerous bacteria. Fifty-seven percent reported always or sometimes stuffing a turkey before cooking instead of baking dressing separately, and 77 percent said they left a cooked bird in a warm oven or at room temperature.\n\nSuch practices can allow the growth not only of salmonella but other bad bugs, such as campylobacter and Clostridium perfringens, she said.\n\n\u201cAll of these illnesses could have been prevented. There\u2019s either cross-contamination going on in the home, or there\u2019s not thorough cooking.\u201d\n\nOther experts contend that simply telling consumers to handle food properly is unfair and ineffective. Regulators and industry should be responsible for preventing contamination in the first place.\n\n\u201cThey ought to be going after these guys like gangbusters,\u201d said Carl Custer, a food safety microbiology consultant who spent decades at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. \u201cThis is a seriously virulent strain.\u201d\n\nThis month, Custer renewed calls for pathogenic strains of salmonella to be declared \u201cadulterants\u201d in poultry, which would require the USDA to test products and recall those contaminated with the bacteria.\n\nThe USDA classified E. coli O157:H7 as an adulterant in ground beef after the deadly 1993 Jack in the Box hamburger outbreak. After that, the rate of those E. coli infections plummeted. Since then, the agency has named six additional strains as adulterants in certain beef products.\n\nEfforts to ban drug-resistant salmonella from meat and poultry have stalled, however, despite years of demands from consumer advocacy groups and lawmakers.\n\nIn February, USDA officials rejected a 2014 petition from the group Center for Science in the Public Interest to declare certain strains of drug-resistant salmonella to be adulterants, saying the group failed to distinguish strongly enough between resistant and non-resistant salmonella.\n\nIn 2015, Democratic congresswomen Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and New York\u2019s Louise Slaughter introduced a bill that would have defined resistant and dangerous salmonella as adulterants and given USDA new power to test and recall tainted meat, poultry and eggs. It was not enacted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to get attention to food safety issues in this current political climate,\u201d said Sarah Sorscher, CSPI\u2019s deputy director of regulatory affairs.\n\nOutside observers said there\u2019s little political will for taking on the nearly $5 billion-a-year U.S. turkey industry, as well as regulators.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a lot of traction for making it an adulterant right now,\u201d said Kirk Smith, director of the Minnesota Integrated Food Safety Center of Excellence.\n\n\u201cSalmonella is still common enough that it would be hugely impractical and costly to make it an adulterant,\u201d he added. \u201cIt would double the cost of poultry.\u201d\n\nIn a sharply worded statement, USDA officials refused to publicly name the producers, suppliers and brands linked to the turkey outbreak, saying it would be \u201cgrossly irresponsible and reckless\u201d when no definite source of illness has been identified.\n\nBecause the outbreak strain of salmonella has been found at turkey-processing plants, in workers and in a wide range of food products, it will take a broad effort to detect and eradicate the source, said Smith, the Minnesota food safety expert.\n\n\u201cIt should be a whole-system approach, starting with controls on the farm, all the way through to educating consumers as best we can,\u201d he said.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Trump was \"aware of this decision and concurs,\" according to the letter.\n\nFollowing the letter from the White House Monday afternoon, CNN dropped the case in court.\n\n\"Today the White House fully restored Jim Acosta's press pass. As a result, our lawsuit is no longer necessary.

His press pass was temporarily restored by a court order Friday and the judge ordered both legal teams to submit a status report detailing how they would like to proceed by 3 p.m. on Monday.\n\nThe Friday ruling guaranteed Acosta use of his press pass to the White House through the end of the month. But over the weekend, the White House wasted no time informing Acosta of a \u201cpreliminary decision\u201d to suspend his pass after that period is up. Lawyers for CNN responded Monday by filing for an emergency hearing the week after Thanksgiving, \u201cor as soon thereafter as possible.\u201d\n\nThe letter cites \u201cbehavior\u201d at a press conference the day after the midterms that \u201cviolated the basic standards governing such events\u201d as the reason to suspend Acosta\u2019s pass. It\u2019s signed by Bill Shine, deputy chief of staff for communications, and Sarah Sanders, White House press secretary, who are both named as defendants in the initial lawsuit.\n\nOver the weekend, Acosta and CNN\u2019s legal team wrote back to Sanders and Shine, calling the letter an \u201cattempt to provide retroactive due process\u201d and requesting the White House \u201crefrain from \u2014 yet again \u2014 violating the constitutional rights of CNN and Acosta.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, Acosta wrote that there were \"no so-called 'widely understood practices'\" governing press conferences, which the White House jumped on in outlining four rules on Monday.\n\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\nCNN filed a lawsuit earlier this week claiming that revoking Acosta's press pass to the White House, known as a \"hard pass,\" violated the First Amendment.\n\nWhite House Correspondents' Association President Olivier Knox issued a statement saying reporters should continue to be allowed to ask follow-up questions.\n\n\"The White House did the right thing in restoring Jim Acosta's hard pass,\" the statement said. \"The White House Correspondents' Association had no role in crafting any procedures for future press conferences. For as long as there have been White House press conferences, White House reporters have asked follow-up questions. We fully expect this tradition will continue. We will continue to make the case that a free and independent news media plays a vital role in the health of our republic,\" Knox said.\n\nU.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly repeatedly emphasized at the court hearing on Friday that his decision to return Acosta's press pass, with a temporary restraining order as litigation continues, was based on the Fifth Amendment, under which the judge ruled Acosta was denied his right to due process. Due process would give Acosta and CNN the chance to rebut and challenge the appropriateness of the government\u2019s action.\n\nIn his remarks, Kelly made clear that the ruling, which is only the beginning of the court proceedings to decide Acosta\u2019s White House access, was narrow and didn\u2019t determine whether or not Acosta\u2019s First Amendment right was violated.\n\nABC News' Jonathan Karl contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "After a 181-year ban, House Democrats aim to allow religious headwear on the floor - ABC News", "description": "ABC News After a 181-year ban, House Democrats aim to allow religious headwear on the floor ABC News Ilhan Omar, one of the first two Muslim women newly-elected to Congress, is helping spearhead an effort to allow religious headwear, such as hijabs or kippahs\u2026", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/181-year-ban-house-democrats-aim-religious-headwear/story?id%3D59292019", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T17:35:00Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "bad url"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Lawsuit filed against operators of limo in fatal NY crash", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Scott defeated sitting Democratic Sen.

The company expanded rapidly in the 1980s under former CEO Jack Welch, accumulating financial companies and the television network NBC.\n\nBut the sprawling company's broad reach has left it vulnerable to market shifts in many industries, and the financial crisis hurt GE badly.\n\nThose vulnerabilities led GE to announce in June that it would shed its health care business and sell its interest in Baker Hughes, which provides drilling services to oil and gas companies, moves analysts applauded as a hopeful sign that GE would narrow its focus.\n\n\"There are too many lines of business,\" said Josh Aguilar, equity analyst from Morningstar. \"They tried to do too many things for too many people.\"\n\nGE's power, aviation and health care businesses are its largest, and power has been plagued by declining demand for traditional power suppliers and a poorly timed acquisition. GE's capital business also has been dragging it down as it faces two investigations.\n\nPOWER:\n\nGE's power division is its largest, but its foundation has been shaken by the changing ways people use energy. Demand for gas turbines \u2014 a core part of GE's power business \u2014 is falling as consumers reduce energy use and switch to renewables. That trend has also hurt GE competitors such as Frankfurt-based Siemens, which announced in August it was restructuring its business and slimming its headquarters after sagging profits in its power and gas division.\n\nInstead of reigning it in during shifting demands for its product, GE bought France-based Alstom's power and grid business, a $10 billion move some analysts say was made in part to keep Alstom out of the hands of competitors including Siemens.\n\n\"While they (Siemens) were restructuring and retrenching and cutting capacity and cutting head counts very painfully, GE was expanding head count,\" said Deane Dray, managing director of RBC Capital Markets, adding that GE overpaid for Alstom. \"On top of all these missteps, the entire power industry is going through a painful transition.\"\n\nGE blamed the Alstom deal, which closed right before the gas turbine market peaked, for the $22 billion writedown it announced in October.\n\nAVIATION:\n\nAviation is the most profitable part of GE's business. The company produces jet engines, aerospace systems, replacement parts and maintenance services for commercial, executive and military aircraft including fighters, bombers, tankers and helicopters.\n\n\"The bright spot for GE has been aviation by far,\" Aguilar said.\n\nGE has had recent technical problems with engines \u2014 a woman was fatally injured on a Southwest jet when an engine made by General Electric and France's Safran SA failed and broke into pieces \u2014 but its competitors have also had issues, and \"everyone else's issues were basically worse,\" Aguilar said.\n\nHEALTH CARE:\n\nGE's health care unit \u2014 its third-largest segment \u2014 produces diagnostic imaging systems including magnetic resonance, X-ray, digital mammography and nuclear imaging.\n\nThe health care business has been relatively stable, but former CEO John Flannery had planned to spin off the health care unit in 2019, a move that analysts saw as an important step toward reducing the company's debt load as it transfers debt and pension liabilities to the separated company.\n\nCulp indicated he intends to follow through with those plans during GE's third quarter earnings call last month.\n\nWhile there are some engineering similarities between the jet engines and steam turbines GE produces, the same can't be said for GE's health care products, analysts said. \"What kind of synergy do you get from making a jet engine and an MRI machine?\" Aguilar asked. \"It doesn't really make sense.\"\n\nCAPITAL:\n\nSeen by some as the \"black hole\" of GE, the capital business \u2014 which includes commercial loans and leases, fleet management, credit cards and personal loans \u2014 is facing a pair of investigations. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into how GE took a $15 billion hit after a subsidiary, North American Life & Health, miscalculated how much it would cost to pay for the care of people who lived longer than projected.\n\nGE also said in February that the Justice Department may take action in connection to an investigation into the company's subprime mortgage loans business."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "After messy Florida recount, Broward election official Brenda Snipes resigns - ABC News", "description": "ABC News After messy Florida recount, Broward election official Brenda Snipes resigns ABC News Florida's most embattled election official is resigning, effective January.

An injured motorcyclist was between life and death, Castaner said.\n\nSince the main protests on Saturday, 528 people have been injured \u2014 17 seriously, the minister said. The figure did not include 92 police officers who were injured, two of them seriously.\n\nHe said that 27,000 protesters blocking strategic traffic zones were active on Monday, far fewer than the nearly 300,000 counted Saturday.\n\nThe government, under fire on other fronts and with Macron's popularity diving in polls, is walking a tightrope in dealing with protesters. Castaner said thousands of security forces were put in the field, mainly to protect the demonstrators.\n\nThe job of policing the protests was becoming more difficult and dangerous due to \"the aggressivity and change in behavior of demonstrators...systematically confronting security forces,\" the minister said.\n\nIn the first sign of a get-tough response from the government, Castaner said the right to protest did not trump the free movement of people and goods. Those who disrupt traffic will be punished, he warned, noting that an individual quickly was convicted and sentenced to four months in prison.\n\nPolice were given orders to clear protesters away from fuel depots and other sensitive sites, three of which had been \"liberated\" so far, he said.\n\nProtest representative Benjamin Cauchy said on France's RMC radio that drivers blocked about 10 oil depots Monday.

About 30 people were arrested overnight as police worked to remove protesters, a security official said.\n\nThe protests reflect broader frustration with Macron, whose government is sticking to the fuel tax rise as part of efforts to clean up the environment.\n\nProtesters called for more national actions Saturday. They also said they were raising money online for the family of the protester who was struck and killed by a panicked driver.\n\nMacron himself wouldn't comment when asked Monday about the protests. He referred to the Sunday night comments by his prime minister, Edouard Philippe, who vowed to keep the fuel tax hikes in place.\n\nThe protest movement represents drivers of various backgrounds, notably those who rely on their cars to get to work.

Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, argues that Whitaker's appointment violates the Constitution because he has not been confirmed by the Senate.\n\nWhitaker was chief of staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and was elevated to the top job after Sessions was ousted by President Donald Trump on Nov. 7.\n\nThe Constitution's Appointments Clause requires that the Senate confirm all principal officials before they can serve in their office.\n\nThe Justice Department released a legal opinion last week that said Whitaker's appointment would not violate the clause because he is serving in an acting capacity. The opinion concluded that Whitaker, even without Senate confirmation, may serve in an acting capacity because he has been at the department for more than a year at a \"sufficiently senior pay level.\"\n\n\"President Trump is denying senators our constitutional obligation and opportunity to do our job: scrutinizing the nomination of our nation's top law enforcement official,\" Blumenthal said in a statement. \"The reason is simple: Whitaker would never pass the advice and consent test. In selecting a so-called 'constitutional nobody' and thwarting every senator's constitutional duty, Trump leaves us no choice but to seek recourse through the courts.\"\n\nThe lawsuit comes days after a Washington lawyer challenged Whitaker's appointment in a pending Supreme Court case dealing with gun rights. The attorney, Thomas Goldstein, asked the high court to find that Whitaker's appointment is unconstitutional and replace him with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nThe state of Maryland also made a similar court filing last week in a legal dispute with the Trump administration over the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRosenstein, the second-ranking Justice Department official, has been confirmed by the Senate and had been overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.

It goes beyond that to freedom of navigation in the seas, concerns about human rights.\"\n\nThe U.S. is interested in a better relationship, \"but there has to be change\" from China's side, Pence said he told Xi, who responded that dialogue is important.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry rejected the U.S. criticism that it was leading other developing nations into debt bondage.\n\n\"The assistance provided by China has been warmly welcomed by our partners in this region and beyond,\" Wang Xiaolong, a Foreign Ministry official, told a news conference.\n\n\"No country either in this region or in other regions has fallen into a so-called debt trap because of its cooperation with China. Give me one example,\" he said.\n\nChina is a relative newcomer to providing aid, and its loan-heavy, no-strings attached approach has unsettled Western nations that have been the mainstay donors to developing nations and often use aid to nudge nations toward reforms.\n\nIn Port Moresby, the impact of China's aid and loans is highly visible.

Some are fleeing wars in their home countries in the Middle East Africa or Asia. Others have been driven away by poverty, lack of freedom or hope for the future.\n\nOne such camp is in the town of Velika Kladusa, in northwestern Bosnia, only about a kilometer (mile) from the heavily guarded border.

As a European Union member, Croatia is easier to pass through toward wealthy EU countries where they hope to find work and start new lives. Many spend months, or sometimes even years, on the road.\n\nAfter their long journeys, many migrants don't have winter shoes, warm socks, caps or gloves. They wrap themselves tightly in blankets, leaving their faces barely visible. At lunch time, they line up for warm meals provided by aid groups. They eat among garbage-strewn, grim-looking tents made of nylon, ropes and cardboard.\n\nAt night, the travelers gather around camp fires warm up or cook.

Dozens of protesters then marched to an outdoor sports complex near downtown where 2,500 migrants are staying, sleeping on dirt fields and under bleachers after arriving at the border city a week ago.\n\nDulce Alvarado, 28, from Lempira, Honduras, said she was stepping out of a corner grocery near the complex carrying her 2-year-old son when she was surrounded by the demonstrators chanting \"Get out!\" and \"We don't want you here!\"\n\n\"I was very scared,\" Alvarado said.\n\nA Tijuana police officer saw them in the crowd and helped them get out and behind police tape marking off the block where the sports complex is located. The protest eventually ended peacefully. On Monday, a Mexican holiday, streets were quiet with many businesses near the complex closed.\n\nTensions have built as nearly 3,000 migrants from the caravan poured into Tijuana in recent days after more than a month on the road \u2014 and with many more months likely ahead of them while they seek asylum in the U.S. The federal government estimates the number of migrants could soon swell to 10,000.\n\nMexico's ambassador to the U.S., Geronimo Gutierrez, told reporters Monday that the situation is a \"wake-up call\" for the U.S., Mexico and Central America that could force the region to work together to address the difficult issue of immigration.\n\nU.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana's main crossing to San Diego. Asylum seekers register their names in a tattered notebook managed by the migrants themselves that had more than 3,000 names even before the caravan arrived.\n\nFor most of this city of 1.6 million, the arrival of thousands of Central Americans is not noticeable. Most migrants stay within a three-block radius of the sports complex that faces the towering metal walls topped with barbed wire at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nBut many residents fear with the passage of time their presence will take its toll and crime could go up. Since 2016, thousands of Haitians who also tried to get to the U.S. ended up settling here, while at the same time, Tijuana has taken in thousands of Mexicans deported from the United States.\n\nTijuana also has been struggling with drug violence and some say they do not want the caravan bringing more problems.\n\nSandra Lucia Montanez, 28, a Tijuana psychologist, said news reports last month of Central Americans storming Mexico's southern border fed the fears. But, she said, it's important that Tijuana not forget it is a city of migrants.\n\n\"Almost no one here is from Tijuana,\" Montanez said. \"We have to help the neediest ones. They come from countries with a lot of poverty. Honduras is worse off than Mexico.\"\n\nThe United States has dramatically increased border security in preparation for the caravan's arrival, closing lanes at ports of entry to place cement barriers topped with razor wire that can be quickly moved to block passage should there be a mass number who try to force their way into the country.\n\nBut the lane closures have also made it harder for cross-border residents to go back and forth into the U.S. to work and shop. The San Ysidro port of entry is one of the world's busiest border crossings, with more than 40,000 vehicles and 34,000 pedestrians using it daily.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. authorities closed off northbound traffic for several hours and closed a pedestrian lane at the crossing to install more security barriers, after a tip that people were gathering in Tijuana to rush the border checkpoints.\n\n\"Waiting until a large group of persons mass at the border to attempt an illegal crossing is too late for us,\" said Pete Flores, director of field operations for Customs and Border Protection in San Diego.\n\nDemonstrators at Sunday's protest complained that some migrants have been aggressive, yelling insults at U.S. Border Patrol agents and climbing walls and getting into fights at Tijuana's Pacific beach.\n\nBut Tijuana police officer Victor Coronel, who has overseen security outside the sports complex where the migrants are staying, said those fears are based on the bad behavior of only a handful of migrants.\n\n\"The problem is that there has been bad information circulating on social media, with videos of two or three migrants acting badly, climbing the wall or grabbing food in stores,\" said Coronel, adding that most are poor people simply trying to find work.\n\nCoronel said he hopes as time passes, many will opt to go home or find jobs in Mexico and integrate into society.\n\nLesbia Navarro, 36, stayed inside the stadium with her four children ages 3 to 16 as they listened to the shouts and insults from the protesters Sunday.\n\n\"We only want to be here awhile, until we can get into the United States to work,\" said Navarro, of Choloma, Honduras. \"We don't want to cause anybody problems.\"\n\nThe Tijuana protests came amid what may be a hardening of positions in some northern Mexican states against the migrants. In Jalisco state, which the caravan passed through on its way to Tijuana, officials said they would no longer open shelters, citing problems with fights involving migrants last week.\n\nInstead, the state will provide water, some food and escorts at nine points along the main highway through the state to help ensure the migrants don't have to stop.\n\nTijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum has called the migrants' arrival an \"avalanche\" that the city is ill-prepared to handle, calculating that they will be in Tijuana for at least six months as they wait to file asylum claims.\n\nGastelum has appealed to the federal government for more assistance to cope with the influx \u2014 while more migrants continue to head to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump used Twitter on Sunday to voice support for the mayor. He wrote that like Tijuana, \"the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!\"\n\nHe followed that tweet by writing: \"Catch and Release is an obsolete term. It is now Catch and Detain.

They said Ethiopian Jews are starving, ostracized and deprived of basic needs in Africa while the government in Israel is \"dragging its feet to come to our rescue.\"\n\nEyayu Abuhay, a community organizer, said 50 Ethiopian Jews have died since 2015 while waiting to join their family members in Israel. \"We want Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to come to our rescue before we all die here,\" he said.\n\nIn February, Ethiopian Jews held a similar protest in Addis Ababa and warned they will stage a mass hunger strike if Israel eliminates funding to help them join their families in Israel. Since then, Israeli officials have visited Ethiopia, but organizers said nothing has changed since then.\n\nMost of the more than 8,000 Ethiopian Jews in the East African nation are practicing Jews and believed to have family members that already reside in Israel. Some told AP they have been separated for more than a decade.\n\nBut Israel doesn't consider them Jewish under strict religious law, meaning their immigration requires special approval. They are descendants of Ethiopian Jews who were forcibly converted to Christianity around a century ago, and the Israeli government views bringing them to Israel as family reunification rather than \"aliya,\" or Jewish immigration. The families allege discrimination.\n\nIn 1991, with Ethiopia in civil war, Israel carried out the dramatic Operation Solomon which airlifted some 14,500 Ethiopian Jews to Israel in less than two days. Now about 145,000 Ethiopian Jews are estimated to be living in Israel.\n\n\"Why are we not allowed to immigrate to Israel? Is it because we are black or uneducated?\" asked Melese Sidisto, a coordinator for Ethiopian Jews in Addis Ababa, who then burst into tears. \"We are being cheated like a child. This is not right.\"\n\nIn a letter addressed to Netanyahu, the Ethiopian Jews in Addis Ababa said they want to go to Israel immediately and without any preconditions to join their family members.\n\n\"Our family members are dying here while we are awaiting your promise to be implemented,\" the letter reads. \"Not implementing the promise amounts of playing with Israeli citizens lives.

Mom is a crank. What is it all for?\"\n\nThe goal, experts say, should be to help kids learn to manage their own time as they get older and to stay physically active and socially connected as much offline as on. But parents in many American households are finding the power struggles \u2014 tantrums, withdrawal and, in some cases, even school and discipline problems \u2014 difficult, especially as more kids get access to screens at younger and younger ages.\n\nA survey of 13- to 17-year-olds released this fall by the nonprofit Common Sense Media found that 95 percent of U.S. teens have their own mobile device. Seventy percent of them check social media several times a day, up from 34 percent in 2012. More than half say that their devices distract them from homework or the people they're with.\n\nSome tech companies now at least acknowledge concerns about over-use and outright abuse of digital media. Apple instituted a \"Screen Time\" function in its latest iPhone software. It monitors app use and allows users \u2014 or their parents \u2014 to establish limits. Google For Families and Google Play, found on Android phones, and various independent apps also allow parents to monitor and set some restrictions.\n\nExperts say time limits can help but are sometimes a moot point given how deeply technology is \"embedded in our daily life,\" says Sarah Domoff, a psychologist at Central Michigan University.\n\nInstead she asks parents: How are your children doing in school? Are they active and physically healthy? Are they connecting with others in positive ways?\n\nShe does have a few basic rules, including limiting screen time for younger kids to the educational stuff. She also suggests making bedrooms \"screen-free zones\" even for teens. (Other experts, at the very least, advise keeping devices out of rooms overnight to avoid late-night shenanigans or other sleep interruptions.)\n\nThe Haileys sheepishly note that Everett routinely multitasks in his room with one eye on a Chromebook laptop and often the other on his phone. \"I think we're kind of wimps,\" Barb Hailey says. Henry doesn't have a phone \u2014 yet.\n\nBut phones and other screens are not allowed during meals \u2014 a limit both boys seem to appreciate.\n\nManaging all this is no easy task, even for experts such as Sierra Filucci, executive editor of parenting content at Common Sense Media, an organization that helps families navigate the digital world.\n\nHer own 12-year-old son, like Henry, is a fan of \"Fortnite.\" She's witnessed the \"bad attitude\" when he's asked to get off the game and take out the garbage or find something to do that doesn't involve a screen.

Experts believe that a wholesale privatization of Petrobras is unlikely under the next government, despite strong support from market-friendly Guedes and Costello Branco.\n\nNegotiations with finance secretary Guedes about the future of the national oil company are underway, Bolsonaro told reporters outside of his home in Rio de Janeiro on Monday.\n\n\"Some of it could be privatized, but not all of it. It is a strategic company,\" said the former army captain and congressman for 27 years.\n\nIn a June op-ed published in the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S. Paulo, Costello Branco argued in favor of privatization, urging more competition in the energy sector.\n\n\"We need several private companies to compete in the fuel market,\" he wrote.\n\nPrivatization is polemical in Latin America's largest nation and highly unpopular among the military, a large sector of Bolsonaro's support. Any privatization, which could lead to an end to subsidized fuel prices, would also likely be strongly opposed by many sectors, including transportation.\n\nStill, Petrobras' non-core activities, such as refining and distribution, could be privatized, experts said.\n\nThe introduction of market-driven fuel prices by Petrobras earlier this year led to a major truckers' strike, paralyzing the country for days. The current government of President Michel Temer put an end to demonstrations after providing fuel subsidies aimed at lowering diesel prices.\n\nIn his op-ed, Costello Branco sharply criticized Temer's decision, arguing that ultimately competition in the energy sector would be better for the nation.\n\n\"It's unacceptable to maintain hundreds of billions of dollars allocated to state companies for activities that could be undertaken by private initiative while the state doesn't have money to pay for basic obligations, like health care, education and public security,\" he wrote.\n\nStill, experts say the current diesel subsidy is likely to be maintained.\n\n\"A new shutdown (by truckers) would be disastrous for this government,\" said Braga.\n\nBefore being a Petrobras board member in 2015 and 2016, Castello Branco was director of mining company Vale from 1999 to 2014. He is currently a professor at Fundacao Getulio Vargas, a university and business-focused think tank. Costello Branco also did post-doctoral studies at the University of Chicago.\n\nHe is the third top Bolsonaro nominee to be trained at the University of Chicago, after Guedes and economist Joaquim Levy, who was recently appointed president of Brazil's National Economic and Social Development Bank.\n\nIn a statement, Petrobras said the current chief executive, Ivan Monteiro, will remain until the new administration takes over."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "6 Romanian ministers fired as party leader seeks more power", "description": "Romania's ruling Social Democratic Party has fired six ministers as the beleaguered party chairman aimed to tighten his grip on the government", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/romania-minister-mayor-resign-government-reshuffle-59288416", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_6a5849d2ce8e4172b34f0a2597d56766_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T14:51:16Z", "content": "Romania's ruling Social Democratic Party fired six ministers on Monday as the beleaguered party chairman sought to tighten his grip on the government.

But it's not going well. Ninety-five percent of U.S. teens have their own mobile devices, and many see screen-time limits as unjustified punishment. Chicago teenager Everett Haile\u2026 [+488 chars]", "fulltext": "It is Saturday morning, and 10-year-old Henry Hailey is up at the crack of dawn. Still in PJs, his microphone-equipped headphones glowing blue in the dim basement, he fixates on the popular online game \"Fortnite\" on a large screen.\n\n\"What?! Right as I was about to finish it, I died,\" he calls out disappointedly to his friend Gus, a fellow fifth-grader playing the game from his home just a few blocks away. \"Dude, I should NOT have died.\"\n\nThe digital battles resume, and Henry's enthusiasm never wanes. Would he play all day if his parents let him? \"Probably,\" he concedes with a slight grin.\n\nBut they do not. Like many other parents, the Haileys are on a reinvigorated mission to limit screen time for Henry and his 15-year-old brother, Everett. For some parents, it feels like an exercise in futility. They are busy, overwhelmed and tired of the fight against increasingly omnipresent screens.\n\nGetting Henry off screens has been a constant battle, his parents say. \"Then once he's off, there's a lot of complaining and grumpiness for a while as we try to coax him to do something else,\" says his mom, Barb Hailey. \"He's upset. Mom is a crank. What is it all for?\"\n\nThe goal, experts say, should be to help kids learn to manage their own time as they get older and to stay physically active and socially connected as much offline as on. But parents in many American households are finding the power struggles \u2014 tantrums, withdrawal and, in some cases, even school and discipline problems \u2014 difficult, especially as more kids get access to screens at younger and younger ages.\n\nA survey of 13- to 17-year-olds released this fall by the nonprofit Common Sense Media found that 95 percent of U.S. teens have their own mobile device. Seventy percent of them check social media several times a day, up from 34 percent in 2012. More than half say that their devices distract them from homework or the people they're with.\n\nSome tech companies now at least acknowledge concerns about over-use and outright abuse of digital media. Apple instituted a \"Screen Time\" function in its latest iPhone software. It monitors app use and allows users \u2014 or their parents \u2014 to establish limits. Google For Families and Google Play, found on Android phones, and various independent apps also allow parents to monitor and set some restrictions.\n\nBut those features aren't enabled by default, so new limits can come as a shock to those on the receiving end.\n\nThat happened late this summer in the Hailey household on Chicago's North Side after dad, Allen Hailey, began watching the amount of time elder son Everett was spending on Wi-Fi. The teen was clocking more than four hours a day on sports videos, games and chats with friends on social media.\n\n\"I don't think he had any idea how much time he was spending online,\" says the father, who decided to block both boys from Wi-Fi during certain hours. He tested it out one night without warning.\n\nOne minute, Everett was talking to a friend on social media. \"Then it went out,\" says the teen, who immediately complained aloud about the injustice of it all. Dad held firm and told him he needed to read a book or go outside to shoot hoops.\n\n\"I didn't do anything wrong to deserve that,\" Everett still insists. \"If I get my work done, I think I should have my own time.\"\n\nResearchers who study these trends generally refrain from using the word \"addiction\" when it comes to screens, as it's not an official diagnosis in the mental health world. But this summer, the World Health Organization added \"gaming disorder\" to its list of afflictions. That is gaming that severely interferes with relationships, school and work. The diagnosis is still under review by U.S. health authorities.\n\nSometimes, experts say, digital immersion exacerbates an existing condition, such as depression, anxiety or issues with body image. That's why teens who attend treatment at Newport Academy, a residential rehab and mental health program with sites across the country, must check their digital devices at the door when they arrive.\n\n\"Almost always, one of the symptoms is an excessive amount of time on smartphones,\" says Heather Senior Monroe, a Newport Academy administrator and licensed clinical social worker. \"And it's usually a large symptom.\"\n\nA small number of facilities have sprung up or added programs to specifically address the abuse of digital media. And in Washington state, a hub of high tech, there's a 12-step group called Internet & Tech Addiction Anonymous .\n\nFrom Henry and Everett's perspective, the real problem is that their parents seem stricter than most.\n\nLike a lot of teens, Everett often uses multiple screens in the evening. He saved his own money to buy himself an older-model iPhone \u2014 \"to fit in,\" he says \u2014 and also uses a Chromebook laptop for homework. At his age, his mom says, his screen habits may be \"a lost cause.\"\n\nBut she keeps working on limits for Henry. Games are not allowed on weekdays. And he gets screen time only if all his homework is done.\n\nExperts say time limits can help but are sometimes a moot point given how deeply technology is \"embedded in our daily life,\" says Sarah Domoff, a psychologist at Central Michigan University.\n\nInstead she asks parents: How are your children doing in school? Are they active and physically healthy? Are they connecting with others in positive ways?\n\nShe does have a few basic rules, including limiting screen time for younger kids to the educational stuff. She also suggests making bedrooms \"screen-free zones,\" even for teens. (Other experts, at the very least, advise keeping devices out of rooms overnight to avoid late-night shenanigans or other sleep interruptions.)\n\nThe Haileys sheepishly note that Everett routinely multitasks in his room with one eye on the Chromebook and often the other on his phone. \"I think we're kind of wimps,\" Barb Hailey says. Henry doesn't have a phone \u2014 yet.\n\nBut phones and other screens are not allowed during meals \u2014 a limit both boys seem to appreciate. Everett says when they go out to eat, he happily leaves his phone in the car and marvels at the number of other families who are at the table with screens. \"That just looks bad,\" he says.\n\nManaging all this is no easy task, even for experts such as Sierra Filucci, executive editor of parenting content at Common Sense Media, an organization that helps families navigate the digital world.\n\nHer own 12-year-old son, like Henry, is a fan of \"Fortnite.\" She's witnessed the \"bad attitude\" when he's asked to get off the game and take out the garbage or find something to do that doesn't involve a screen. But she also sees the positives \u2014 connections he's made with new friends at school, for instance. For her, the question is: \"How do we help him self-regulate?\"\n\nSome parents simply put off getting their kid a phone. Jacqui Koch, a college professor and mother in Wilmette, Illinois, had her sixth-grade daughter sign a pledge to wait until eighth grade for a smartphone \u2014 part of the national \" Wait Until 8th \" movement. Her daughter didn't put up much fuss, in part because mom has limited tech use for years.\n\n\"We are definitely not the norm of what we're surrounded by,\" Koch says, noting that she saw a \"huge uptick\" of kids with phones in fifth grade. Now some parents she knows are trying to backpedal, \"and that's hard,\" she says.\n\nThe idea is that Wait Until 8th and events such as the National Day of Unplugging , an annual event in March, will make screen limits more socially acceptable and less like an adult-world imposition on kids.\n\nAnother key: Parents setting limits with their own devices.\n\nWhen Allen Hailey is on his phone while watching a football game, Everett is quick to tell him that he's on his phone too much. \"He gets really mad,\" Everett says.\n\nWhen mom comes home, she says she tries to put down her phone, though it's hard not to check emails for work. \"Let me just check in,\" she'll say \u2014 and before long finds herself on Instagram and Facebook.\n\n\"You can go down the rabbit hole so easily,\" Barb Hailey says. \"Then you get it thrown back in your face.\"\n\nIt's not an easy balance to strike, but all the Haileys are trying. \"We may not like it,\" Everett says, as his little brother nods. \"But we know it's for the best.\"\n\nTheir dad still wants his boys to read 30 minutes a day. After he put the limits on the Wi-Fi, Everett went out and bought two books, then texted Dad photos of them to prove he'd done it.\n\nThe boys do regularly hang out with friends in person, and both play soccer. Everett plays the saxophone. Henry plays trumpet and recently took up the drums.\n\nMom laughs: \"So when we say, 'Get off the screen' and he goes and plays the snare drum, we have to live with that decision.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOnline:\n\nCommon Sense Media report: https://bit.ly/2Oc7Nsg\n\nWHO gaming disorder: https://bit.ly/2CDUqM1\n\nInternet & Tech Addiction Anonymous: https://bit.ly/2FoAbb3\n\nWait Until 8th: https://bit.ly/2voBLPO\n\nNational Day of Unplugging: https://bit.ly/2EhAnYv\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMartha Irvine, an AP national writer and visual journalist, can be reached at mirvine@ap.org or at http://twitter.com/irvineap"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "General Electric shuffles management at power unit", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

But demand for its key gas turbines has fallen as consumers have reduced energy use and switched to renewables.\n\nGE announced last month that it would split its power business into two separate divisions: one that will focus on gas turbines and related services and another that includes its steam, grid solutions, nuclear and power conversion operations.\n\nThe GE Gas Power business will be led by John Rice, who retired from GE in December after 39 years with the company. Rice will return to serve as chairman of the Gas Power business. Scott Strazik, currently president Power Services, will serve as CEO of Gas Power.\n\nRussell Stokes, who is currently CEO of GE Power, will serve as CEO of GE Power Portfolio, the new unit focused on steam, nuclear and other areas. Stokes is a 20-year GE veteran who has worked in aviation, transportation and other parts of the company.\n\n\"One of my top priorities is positioning our businesses to win, starting with GE Power,\" GE CEO Larry Culp said in a statement Monday. \"The leaders we are announcing today are exceptionally well suited to lead our new Gas Power and Power Portfolio teams in their efforts to deliver better customer outcomes and improve their execution and cost structures.\"\n\nThe management changes come less than two months after the GE board ousted former CEO John Flannery, who served just one year on the job. Flannery was replaced by Culp, who is widely respected by Wall Street analysts for increasing profitability at Danaher Corp. when he was CEO.\n\nCulp, who served on the board at GE before he was named CEO, is seen as an outsider, and he chose to appoint long-time GE employees to the roles.\n\n\"You need people who are familiar with where the business has been conducted and where there are going to be shifts in the future with emerging markets,\" said Nick Heymann, co-group head of global industrial infrastructure at William Blair & Co. \"They want people that are understood by the team.\"\n\nThe power unit recorded a $22 write-down in the third quarter. GE said the charge was largely the result of its acquisition of Alstom for $10 billion. GE bought the French company's power and grid business in 2015 just before the gas turbine market peaked.\n\nIn developing markets, there's little need for new fossil fuel development, Heymann said. But there's strong opportunity for gas turbine growth in emerging markets, and those trends developed more precipitously than originally thought, he said.\n\n\"It isn't somebody chasing the odyssey,\" Heymann said. \"It happened quickly to everybody.\"\n\nGE has been gradually shedding parts of its multi-arm business. Last week it announced it sold part of its Healthcare Equipment Finance business \u2014 a division of GE Capital \u2014 to TIAA Bank. Earlier this month, GE announced an agreement to sell its Current, powered by GE business \u2014 part of the company's lighting business \u2014 to American Industrial Partners."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "White House again threatens Acosta's pass", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Add Interest\n\nThe Trump administration on Monday abruptly dropped its effort to bar CNN reporter Jim Acosta from the White House, but warned he could have his credentials pulled again if he doesn't follow guidelines governing journalists' behavior.\n\nThe White House said reporters would be permitted one question each if called upon at news conferences and allowed follow-ups only at the discretion of the president.\n\nIn a letter to Acosta, White House communications director Bill Shine and press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said they will be forced to reconsider the decision \"if unprofessional behavior occurs.\"\n\nCNN said that, as a result, it has dropped its lawsuit against the White House filed on Acosta's behalf.\n\n\"Thanks to everyone for their support,\" Acosta tweeted. \"As I said last Friday ... let's get back to work.\"\n\nThe White House initially revoked Acosta's credentials after he and Trump tangled verbally during a Nov. 7 press conference. The administration's initial reasoning was that Acosta had manhandled a White House intern seeking to take his microphone, but that fell apart after Sanders distributed a doctored video sped up to make Acosta look more aggressive than he actually was.\n\nInstead, the White House focused on behavior they deemed disrespectful to the president. Acosta and CNN have been frequent targets of a president who has derided coverage of his administration as \"fake news\" and called the media the enemy of the people.\n\nCNN filed suit to get Acosta's credentials restored, arguing that the action violated the constitutional right to freedom of the press and that he had been denied due process. In Washington, D.C. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly cited the due process argument last Friday in granting Acosta a two-week injunction to get back to work.\n\nThe White House initially fought back, saying it had made a preliminary decision to keep Acosta out when the two weeks were up. But after CNN requested a hearing, Shine and Sanders changed course.\n\n\"The view from here is that White House interaction with the press is, and generally should be, subject to kind of a natural give and take,\" Shine and Sanders wrote. \"President Trump believes strongly in the First Amendment and interacts with the press in just such a way. It would be a great loss for all if, instead of this give-and-take, and instead of relying on the professionalism of White House journalists, we were compelled to devise a lengthy and detailed code of conduct.\"\n\nStill, they did outline rules compelling journalists at news conferences to physically surrender microphones if the president hasn't granted them a follow-up question, and said a failure to abide by these standards could result in them losing their passes.\n\nThe White House Correspondents Association said the White House did the right thing in restoring Acosta's pass. The WHCA said it had no role in crafting any of the new procedures, and objected to one.\n\n\"For as long as there have been White House press conferences, White House reporters have asked follow-up questions,\" said Olivier Knox, WHCA president. \"We fully expect this tradition will continue.\"\n\nIn Acosta, the media had an imperfect First Amendment champion. Even some critics in the media world have said he occasionally seems more interested in making a point than in asking a question. In the Nov. 7 news conference, he and Trump briefly argued over the president's contention that a group of Latin American migrants headed to the southern U.S. border represented an invasion.\n\nYet dozens of news organizations filed briefs supporting CNN in its case against the White House.\n\n\"We are not the enemy of the people,\" Acosta tweeted Monday. \"I am not your enemy. You are not my enemy. It is wrong to call your fellow Americans the enemy. We are all on the same team. We are all Americans.\"\n\nThe administrations got in one last twist Monday. CNN was informed of the decision to drop the case in a letter to Acosta \u2014 delivered after his competitor, Fox News Channel's John Roberts, tweeted the \"SCOOP\" that the White House would not seek to revoke his pass.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nLucey reported from Washington."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Emily Shapiro", "title": "Chris Watts to be sentenced for killing pregnant wife, young daughters", "description": "Chris Watts pleaded guilty in the deaths of his wife and young daughters.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/chris-watts-sentenced-killing-pregnant-wife-young-daughters/story?id=59289504", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/christopher-watts1-ht-ml-180816_hpMain_v12x5_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T14:17:08Z", "content": "The Colorado man who pleaded guilty to killing his pregnant wife and two young daughters is set to be sentenced Monday.

Add Interest\n\nSaudi Arabia's King Salman on Monday gave his first major speech since the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents, expressing support for his son, the crown prince, and making no mention of allegations that the young royal ordered the killing.\n\nThe annual policy speech by the king instead highlighted Saudi Arabia's priorities for the coming year, focusing on issues such as the war in Yemen, security for Palestinians, stability in the oil market, countering rival Iran and job creation for Saudis.\n\nThe king voiced support for his favored son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, saying that the 32-year-old heir to the throne is focused on developing the capabilities of Saudi youth. The prince oversees all major levers of power in the kingdom, ranging from security to the economy.\n\n\"The country is working tirelessly to create more jobs and training for Saudi youth,\" Salman said. \"The crown prince, chairman of the Council of Economic Affairs and Development, has focused on developing human capabilities and preparing the new generation for future jobs.\"\n\nSaudi media reported Monday that the crown prince will attend the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires later this month. It would be the first trip abroad for the crown prince after the Oct. 2 slaying of Khashoggi, and would bring him face to face with world leaders from the U.S., Turkey, Canada and European countries that have strongly criticized the kingdom for the brutal killing.\n\nKing Salman delivered his remarks in the ornate hall of the consultative Shura Council before the country's ministers, senior officials, military officers and clerics. Prince Mohammed was in attendance and seated next to the country's top cleric.\n\nIn the wake of Khashoggi's killing inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the 82-year-old monarch put Prince Mohammed in charge of overseeing the reorganization of intelligence services. The king's speech made no reference to that, but he did commend Saudi Arabia's judiciary and public prosecution for their work in seeking justice in accordance with Islamic law.\n\nHe said the kingdom \"takes pride in the blessed efforts\" of the judiciary and public prosecution, adding that Saudi Arabia affirms its commitment to the application of Islamic law.\n\nOn Thursday, Saudi prosecutors said they are seeking the death penalty against five men suspected of killing Khashoggi, who had written critically of the crown prince in columns for The Washington Post. The prosecutor's announcement sought to quiet the global outcry over Khashoggi's death and distance the killers and their operation from the crown prince.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials, however, have concluded that the crown prince ordered the killing, according to a U.S. official familiar with the assessment. Others familiar with the case caution that while it's likely that the crown prince was involved in the death, there continue to be questions about what role he played.\n\nSaudi investigators say a high-ranking adviser to the crown prince, Saud al-Qahtani, and a senior intelligence official, Ahmed al-Assiri, concocted a plan to force Khashoggi to return to Saudi Arabia, deeming his presence abroad as a threat to national security.\n\nSaudi prosecutors say the 15-man team sent to Istanbul exceeded their authority when the lead negotiator in the team decided to kill Khashoggi for refusing orders to return. The Saudis say the agents killed Khashoggi with tranquilizers and then dismembered his body, which has not been found.\n\nThose findings came after Saudi authorities spent weeks denying Khashoggi had been killed in the embassy.\n\nThis past week, U.S. intelligence officials briefed members of the Senate and House intelligence committees on their conclusions, and the Treasury Department announced economic sanctions on 17 Saudi officials suspected of being responsible for or complicit in the killing. Among those sanctioned was al-Qahtani, who was fired from his post as the crown prince's adviser after details of the killing emerged.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said his administration will get \"a very full report,\" including who was responsible for Khashoggi's death, on Monday or Tuesday. Trump has criticized the Saudi response to the killing, but has been reluctant to say definitively if he thinks the crown prince ordered it.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBatrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

It bought nearly 29 billion cubic meters last year. That gas is currently transported through another line under the Black Sea, called Blue Stream, and the onshore West Line through Ukraine, which is mired in conflict with Russia.\n\n\"Turkey will be able to fulfill its own as well as European countries' natural gas demands without being exposed to transit risks,\" Erdogan said, as he announced that TurkStream would begin operations in 2019.\n\nUkraine's struggling economy relies on fees it receives for transporting Russian gas. Russia has threatened to stop using Ukrainian pipelines for transit but has not made any decisions to bypass Ukraine as a transit point altogether.\n\nTurkey and Russia have warmed in the last two years after Erdogan apologized for the downing of a Russian fighter jet along the border with Syria in 2015 that soured relations. Their increasing cooperation in energy and trade as well as Ankara's pledge to buy a Russian surface-to-air missile defense system has worried the Western allies of Turkey, a NATO member.\n\nErdogan said the two countries aimed for long-term cooperation and their relationship was not dictated by \"other countries' demands or impositions.\"\n\nWith Erdogan and Putin's instructions, the last part of the offshore pipe was laid on live broadcast, reaching Turkish shores at Kiyikoy near Istanbul.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Whistleblower in Danish banking scandal: Bank ignored me", "description": "The man who blew the whistle on a massive money laundering scheme through the Estonian branch of Denmark's Danske Bank says the firm \"deliberately ignored\" his warning.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/whistleblower-danish-banking-scandal-bank-59288415", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_4f8e3fc5e33d489a91c8c4003a620dfa_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T12:39:46Z", "content": "Denmark's largest bank \"deliberately ignored\" a warning about a massive money laundering scheme through its Estonian branch, a former employee and whistleblower said Monday.

The findings prompted Denmark's financial regulator to reopen a probe and Danish prosecutors have started a criminal investigation.\n\nJesper Berg, the head of Denmark's Financial Supervisory Authority, admitted it wasn't until Denmark's Berlingske daily in February cited an internal Danske Bank report that it launched an investigation.\n\n\"When you look at all the information today, one may wonder why one didn't do more,\" Berg said.

Berg said \"Russia is the biggest risk factor for money laundering in our part of the world.

High blood sugar over a long period of time can lead to devastating complications.\n\nIn the short term, blood sugars that are too high or too low can be deadly.\n\nKerri Sparling, from the blog SixUntilMe.com, also is a mother of two and was diagnosed in second grade. No one else in her family has Type 1 diabetes, and she remembers her parents being very upset with the diagnosis.\n\nThey tried to explain a chronic illness to her, to which she said, \"So I'm gonna have it until Christmas?!\u201d\n\nHer parents gently replied, \"No, honey -- all the Christmases.\"\n\nType 1 diabetes can strike people at any age and in any condition. Once called \"juvenile diabetes,\" we now know people can be diagnosed as children or adults.\n\nSymptoms often include extreme thirst, frequent urination and sudden weight loss, leading to a medical visit during which a person is given a blood test -- the only way to identify Type 1 diabetes. For those at risk, their blood sugar is dangerously high.\n\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition in which a person\u2019s immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, and it can no longer make insulin. Insulin is essential for life because it delivers glucose, aka blood sugar, which all cells in the body need to function.\n\nThere may be instant relief after diagnosis, knowing that there is a name for what is happening and that there are monitoring systems -- and that insulin that will be available for daily treatment. But for a person with Type 1 diabetes, life is never the same.\n\n\"After my diagnosis, I was ready to do whatever was necessary to take care of this disorder, but it's unimaginable the amount of work that is required to keep your blood sugar within a safe range when your pancreas stops making its own insulin,\" Kelly said.\n\nThis is different from the more common Type 2 diabetes, most often seen in adults with obesity, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Both types are believed to have a genetic component, and both are linked to the pancreas.\n\nCDC\n\nIn Type 2 diabetes, however, the pancreas still makes some insulin and it can be controlled with oral medication, exercise and diet.\n\nThere is currently no way to prevent Type 1 diabetes, typically referred to as T1DM, and there is no cure.\n\nABC News' Medical Unit has previously reported on the technology available now to make managing diabetes easier and the solutions on the horizon.\n\nFor now, it's a very difficult disorder to manage, surrounded by second-guessing by the individual and the well-meaning people around them who may offer dietary advice without understanding Type 1 diabetes.\n\n\"I choose when I eat my carbohydrates carefully,\" Kelly said. \"So if I want to have pizza or chocolate cake I can. ... but I need to know how many carbohydrates are in that food and take the necessary insulin through my pump, so my blood sugar doesn't skyrocket. And I can't take too much insulin or my blood sugar will plummet and I can go into a coma and worse.\"\n\n\"I'm also considering variables like whether I\u2019ll be exercising soon or sleeping soon and what my current blood sugar is,\" Kelly added. \"I have to think of all those things before I eat and make insulin dosing decisions. So it's not helpful if other people are commenting on my meal choices.\"\n\nNew daily life\n\nEvery day, a person with T1DM needs to make many decisions: They need to check their blood sugar levels with a finger-stick test regularly, especially before they eat; inject themselves with insulin, as no pills are available to treat T1DM, or use an insulin pump device; and actively think about what they're eating -- how many carbohydrates every meal or snack contains.\n\nrisapulver/Twitter\n\nIf they're sick, more active than usual, gained or lost weight, they need to adjust the insulin doses; these variables are difficult to manage.\n\nAnd finally, they need to watch out for dangerous signs of blood sugar being too low or too high. They may begin to learn to care for their own body better than any health care professional can.\n\nAnd they need to do this every hour, of every day, of every year. There is no quitting or putting diabetes on hold.\n\nleelee1789/Twitter\n\nCarl Armato, CEO of Novant Health, recently published \"A Future With Hope.\" He was diagnosed with T1DM as a toddler.

You lose. You fail. Then you have to get back up and fight.\"\n\nKelly, the mother of two diagnosed in her 20s, works with her endocrinologist, certified diabetes nurse educator and, at times, a specialized nutritionist.\n\nShe looks at dealing with the disorder as \"going into battle.\"\n\n\"I always have my diabetes devices with me.

They can prescribe insulin and talk to a person with diabetes about their health, and check blood tests that measure their average blood sugar level over the past three months to see how well they are controlling their blood sugar.\n\nKelly said: \"For me, the diabetes online community has been so important. Emotionally and practically, it helps so much to share information and experiences with other people with Type 1 diabetes.\"\n\n\"This is a lot to deal with, and most people in my life have very little understanding of what I'm really doing to take care of myself,\" she added. \"Well-meaning people want to suggest 'alternative' treatments involving cinnamon or a special herb, and I have to say, 'Thanks, but I'll always need insulin.'\"\n\n\"It's good to connect with other PWDs who really get it,\" she added, referring to persons with diabetes.\n\nOne of the first people to share experiences online was Kerri Sparling, who said that when she started blogging she was one of four or five T1 bloggers she knew about.\n\nToday, she regularly speaks on panels at diabetes conferences.\n\n\"I started Six Until Me in May of 2005 because I was tired of Googling 'diabetes' and coming up with little more than a list of complications and frightening stories,\" she said. \"Where were all the people who were living with this disease, like I have been since I was a little girl?

A Halloween Poem.\"\n\nSTOCK/Getty Images\n\nShe's written a book called \"Balancing Diabetes\" but points out she isn't a medical professional and joked, \"I can't even drive a stick.\"\n\nBut her openness about her experience is invaluable to a large community of people living with Type 1 diabetes who gather online in Facebook groups, at conferences and monthly meet-ups in their own community to avoid the isolation.\n\n\"For much of my life, I was the only diabetic I knew,\" Sparling said. \"Thankfully, that's not the case anymore.\"\n\n\"When you're diagnosed so young, every life event has included diabetes,\" she continued. \"I went to prom with diabetes. I got my license with diabetes. I graduated high school with diabetes. I had a special pocket sewn into my wedding dress for my insulin pump.\"\n\nIn her day-to-day life, she thinks about diabetes every few minutes. From the moment she opens her eyes in the morning until she closes her eyes at night, there are hundreds of small decisions she needs to make to keep herself safe.\n\nThere is a \"variable to everything that you do -- how to get dressed, how far is the drive,\" she said. \"It all becomes automatic after a few decades.\"\n\nIf people with Type 1 diabetes don't use newer technologies, like an insulin pump or a continuous glucose monitor, they may need to inject themselves with insulin four to eight times a day and check finger-sticks at least six to eight times a day.\n\nSometimes, they need to check more. They must always be aware of how their body feels when blood sugar level is too high or too low. If it's too high, some people describe feeling anxious, a stomachache, very thirsty or not themselves. If it's too low, which can be very dangerous, they may feel a headache, tremors, heart palpitations, confused, slur speech or even be unresponsive.\n\nCDC\n\n\"We tiptoe that line all the time, between I'm sick and I'm fine,\" she said.\n\nBut she doesn\u2019t let that stop her from living her life.\n\n\"You can do everything everyone else can do, except make insulin,\" Sparling said.\n\nSpeaking of insulin, diabetes is one of the most expensive chronic conditions -- insulin prices has tripled in the past 15 years.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2015, the price of Novolog, a commonly used insulin, went from $100 per vial to $336 per vial in the United States. People have been known to ration their insulin, which can be deadly for someone with T1DM.\n\nThere are generic versions, or alternative types of insulin, as well as patient-assistance programs, which can help to decrease the cost of insulin. The Endocrine Society and other physician and patient advocacy groups are calling on the government to pursue initiatives on insulin affordability.\n\nIn the meantime, people with diabetes are their own best advocates.\n\nWhat about these things I read online about pumps and sensors, and the 'artificial pancreas?' Is that a cure?\n\nTechnology in diabetes is evolving at the fastest pace in history and working to improve the lives of people with T1DM. There are insulin pumps that can automatically decrease the amount of insulin you get if your blood sugar numbers are too low or heading low.\n\nThere are continuous glucose monitors, or CGMs, which sense your blood sugar levels every five minutes without requiring a finger-stick prick.\n\nAnd now, there are systems whereby the CGM can communicate with the insulin pump in a \"hybrid closed-loop system.\" At Boston University and various start-ups across the country, there's ongoing research to build a \"closed-loop system,\" or artificial pancreas, that does not require any human input.\n\nWe are so close, and yet so far. Even the most advanced systems on the market now still require human input. If the blood sugar is too low or too high, the sensors or pumps will beep, and ask for a confirmatory finger-stick test. People still need to input the amount of food they\u2019re going to eat, or make adjustments if they\u2019re going to exercise or not eat for a long period of time.\n\nMachines can experience technical errors or malfunction, however; tubing may kink or get clogged, the sensor or pump can fall off or the battery may run out.\n\nYou can't turn your brain \"off\" no matter how good the technology is.\n\nSparling, the blogger, said she has \"hope for a cure,\" but \"I have to live today.\"\n\nThere are many famous and successful athletes and professionals with T1DM who never let their disease define their careers. Mountain climber Will Cross climbed Mount Everest, professional football player Mark Andrews and Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, to name a few, continue to achieve their dreams while living with T1DM.\n\nMy loved one was just diagnosed with T1DM. What can I do to help?\n\n\"What anyone with diabetes soon learns is that you can't do this alone,\" said Armato, the CEO of Novant Health. \"A good steady support system ... is like the breath of life.\"\n\nHere are some key tips for family and friends of people with T1DM:\n\n-- Understand this is a disease that requires nearly 24/7 attention. Have empathy. Be positive, not critical and judgmental.\n\n-- Learn about T1DM from trustworthy sources instead of passing on things you've heard.\n\n-- Recognize the signs and symptoms of low blood sugar.\n\n-- Know where your loved one keeps their glucometer, insulin supplies and glucose tabs.\n\n-- Know the phone number of your loved one's doctors.\n\n\"You can do the absolute best,\" Sparling said, \"and things can still happen.\"\n\nOnline resources\n\nThere are some good, reliable online resources and meetings for people with T1DM and their family and friends.\n\nArmato and Sparling emphasized the importance of having support.\n\n\"Find your support community, someone who can say 'me too' and be there for you -- it's very powerful -- someone who won't judge you and will hold you when you're down,\" Sparling said.\n\nHere are some trusted organizations for whose living with Type 1 diabetes:\n\n-- American Diabetes Association\n\n-- JDRF (Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation)\n\n-- College Diabetes Network\n\n-- SixUntilMe\n\n-- BeyondType1\n\n-- DiaTribe\n\n-- Children With Diabetes\n\nDr. Tiffany Yeh is currently an endocrinology fellow at New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.

However, his time in power was marred by allegations of wartime atrocities, corruption and nepotism.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister.

That left his government with a thin parliamentary majority and appeared to give the prime minister at least a few more months in office.\n\nWhile Netanyahu can declare victory, the big winner of the crisis appears to be Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza. Over the past week, Hamas has exposed major divisions in Israel over Gaza policy that could bring about the collapse of the governing coalition at any time.\n\nHere's a closer look:\n\nCONFLICT IN GAZA\n\nIsrael and Hamas are bitter enemies who have fought three wars since the militant group seized control of the Gaza Strip in 2007. Israel and Egypt have maintained a tight blockade on Gaza to weaken Hamas, devastating the territory's already fragile economy.\n\nSince late March, Hamas has been leading mass demonstrations along Gaza's perimeter fence in a bid to break the blockade. More than 170 Palestinians and an Israeli soldier have been killed in the weekly demonstrations. But in recent weeks, Egyptian and U.N. mediators had made progress toward an unofficial cease-fire that would ease the blockade in exchange for quieting the demonstrations.\n\nThat progress was upset last week when a botched Israeli military raid in Gaza set off two days of heavy fighting in which Palestinian militant groups fired some 460 projectiles, including an anti-tank missile that struck a bus, into Israel, while the Israeli air force struck dozens of targets in Gaza.\n\nIn all, 14 Palestinians, including 12 militants, were killed, while a Palestinian laborer working in Israel was killed by a Gaza rocket.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nCRISIS IN ISRAEL\n\nJust as the sides were on the brink of another war, Egyptian mediators forged a truce to end the fighting. That set off a political crisis in Israel.\n\nDefense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who had favored a much tougher response, resigned in protest. Bennett, who also wanted tougher action, said he would resign if he was not given the defense portfolio.\n\nNetanyahu on Sunday rejected Bennett's ultimatum and took over the Defense Ministry, seeming to set the stage for his coalition to collapse. But in a last-minute about-face, Bennett backed down Monday and said he would give Netanyahu a chance to deal with Israel's security challenges more firmly.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNETANYAHU'S CALCULATIONS\n\nAs opposition leader a decade ago, Netanyahu vowed to take a tougher line against Hamas than his predecessor, Ehud Olmert. But since taking office in early 2009, Netanyahu has concluded that toppling Hamas would require a lengthy military operation that would cost many lives.\n\nReluctant to pay such a price, he instead seems content to keep a weakened Hamas in check.\n\nKeeping Gaza quiet benefits Netanyahu on several levels. Working-class border towns in southern Israel are considered strongholds of his ruling Likud Party. Netanyahu does not want an election at a time when his base is angry over the cease-fire.\n\nNetanyahu also has long argued that Israel has more serious security concerns on its northern front \u2014 where Iranian forces are active in neighboring Syria and Hezbollah has amassed an arsenal of well over 100,000 rockets and missiles in Lebanon.\n\nYechiel Leiter, a former chief of staff for Netanyahu, said countering Iran is the \"hallmark\" of the prime minister's agenda.\n\n\"Gaza is not an existential threat,\" said Leiter, who is now a senior fellow at the Kohelet Policy Forum, a conservative think tank. \"Iran is the overarching agenda playing behind the scenes.\" That was why Netanyahu did not go \"full throttle\" against Hamas, he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDIVISION INSTEAD OF CONCESSIONS\n\nNetanyahu may also have a deeper agenda.\n\nHamas seized control of Gaza from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority in 2007, leaving President Mahmoud Abbas only governing parts of the West Bank.\n\nBy allowing Hamas to survive, Netanyahu is deepening the territorial and political split between the West Bank and Gaza. With the Palestinians weak and divided, there is little pressure for Netanyahu to make concessions, allowing him to expand West Bank settlements and solidify Israeli control over the territory.\n\nAbbas fears Israel and the U.S. are collaborating on a peace plan that would cement this division, falling short of his demand for an independent Palestinian state that includes all of the West Bank and Gaza under his control.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHAMAS HOLDS THE CARDS\n\nHamas has been riding high since the cease-fire. Suffering minimal casualties, it has enjoyed a boost in popularity with the Gaza public and is now working with Egyptian mediators toward expanding the cease-fire to ease the blockade. Any lift in the economy will deepen the group's rule over Gaza.\n\nIn addition, Hamas showed that while it may not be able to defeat the Israeli military, it can disrupt life throughout southern Israel and put heavy pressure on Netanyahu.\n\nAnother barrage of rockets would almost certainly cause Netanyahu's coalition to collapse or force him into a war that he doesn't want. That should give Hamas additional leverage as the cease-fire talks proceed.\n\nReuven Hazan, a political scientist at Hebrew University, said Hamas has emerged as key factor in the next Israeli election campaign. \"People in Gaza will be able to decide what issue we focus on, how much we focus on it, and whether the government is going to be looked upon favorably or not,\" he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nA DELICATE BALANCING ACT\n\nNetanyahu will have to proceed with caution. If cease-fire talks move forward and he makes concessions to Hamas, he could face a backlash from Bennett, who can bring down the coalition and force new elections at any time.\n\nAnother coalition partner, the centrist Kulanu Party, last week urged Netanyahu to dissolve the government and hold early elections.\n\nIts leader, Moshe Kahlon, has not issued any ultimatums. But the two men are scheduled to meet later in the week, meaning Netanyahu is not out of the woods yet.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Isabel DeBre contributed reporting."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Reports say Nissan's Ghosn questioned over financial reports", "description": "Japanese media: Carlos Ghosn, Nissan Motor Co. chairman, questioned by Tokyo prosecutors over suspected false financial reporting", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/reports-nissans-ghosn-questioned-financial-reports-59287675", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/WireAP_13a923fc80de427d8dcd04be91522c1a_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T09:16:49Z", "content": "Japanese media say Carlos Ghosn, Nissan Motor Co. chairman, is being questioned by Tokyo prosecutors on suspicion he falsified his financial reports.

The allegations also concern a Nissan representative director, Greg Kelly, who was also arrested.\n\nSaikawa said Nissan's board will vote Thursday on dismissing both Ghosn and Kelly, who he described as the \"mastermind\" of the alleged abuses.\n\n\"This is an act that cannot be tolerated by the company,\" he said. \"This is serious misconduct.\"\n\nSaikawa said three major types of misconduct were found, including under-reporting income, using investment funds for personal gain and illicit use of company expenses.\n\nAsked why the company had failed to spot the illicit activity for so long, Saikawa said it was because a \"system in the company\" allowed a lack of transparency that made the wrongdoing possible.\n\nThroughout the news conference he repeatedly said he was constrained by the ongoing investigation from disclosing many of the details of the case. But he promised to beef up corporate governance, adding that the problems may have happened because too much power was concentrated in one person.\n\n\"We need to really look back at what happened, take it seriously and take fundamental countermeasures,\" he said.\n\nAlready at Nissan for 19 years, Ghosn signed a contract earlier this year that would have run through 2022. His compensation, high by Japan's moderate standards for executive pay, has been an issue over the years.\n\nAccording to NHK and the Kyodo News Service, Nissan paid Ghosn nearly 10 billion yen ($89 million) over five years through March 2015, including salary and other income from the company, but reported as if he only made 5 billion yen ($44 million), or half of what he had received.\n\nNissan's annual securities report shows Ghosn received annual remuneration exceeding 1 billion yen ($8.9 million) until fiscal 2016, when shareholders voted against his pay package and his annual pay dropped to 735 million yen ($6.5 million) in 2017, down more than 30 percent.\n\nShares in Renault SA of France plunged 14 percent early Monday. The news of Ghosn's troubles broke after Japanese markets had closed for the day.\n\nThe allegations are a serious blow at a time when Nissan and Mitsubishi Motor Co. are still overcoming scandals over their quality testing reporting.\n\nGhosn is credited with helping engineer a remarkable turnaround at Nissan over the past two decades, resuscitating the Japanese automaker from near bankruptcy after he was sent in by Renault.\n\nFor the past two decades, he has maintained an unusually high profile in a nation where foreign chief executives of major Japanese companies are still relatively rare.\n\nHe looms similarly large in France, where the business world saw him as a trailblazer from outside the traditional French mold who turned Renault around and made it into a global player, notably in electric vehicles. He also led the French carmaker through massive job cuts and a costly, contentious bailout amid the world financial meltdown a decade ago and what he called a \"crisis of massive proportions\" for the auto industry.\n\nGhosn has also been a nemesis for French unions and left-wing politicians, who saw him as a symbol of globalized, U.S.-driven capitalism and its excesses \u2014 and notably its executive pay packages.\n\nShareholders at Renault voted in 2016 against Ghosn's pay package, seeing it as too generous \u2014 but the board ignored the vote. That prompted the ire of then-President Francois Hollande. Hollande's socialist government imposed limits on executive pay at state-run companies and tried to do the same in the private sector but backed down amid concerns that it would scare away foreign investment.\n\nNicknamed \"Le Cost Cutter,\" Ghosn's appointment inspired fears of social and economic upheaval amid plant closings, mass layoffs and the potential damage his reforms might inflict on Nissan's ties with its suppliers. But his triumph in turning the company around and introducing greater efficiency made him something of a national hero.\n\nGhosn served as Nissan's chief executive from 2001 until April 2017, becoming chief executive of Renault in 2005, leading the two major automakers simultaneously. In 2016, Ghosn became Mitsubishi Motors' chairman.\n\nAsked if Ghosn was a charismatic leader or a despot, Saikawa said that as an outsider, \"He achieved much that many others could not do in reforms, especially in the beginning.\"\n\n\"This is the negative outcome of the long regime of Mr. Ghosn. But over these 19 years we have been developing many things,\" Saikawa said. \"He was a part of that but it was the result of hard work by many people.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo and Angela Charlton in Paris contributed.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nYuri Kageyama is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nOn Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Rick Klein and MaryAlice Parks", "title": "The Note: Mississippi runoff tests Democrats' momentum", "description": "There are a few reasons to think that the Mississippi Senate runoff would offer the right mix of circumstances for a Democratic upset.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/note-mississippi-runoff-tests-democrats-momentum/story?id=59282557", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/voters-2-gty-er-181031_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T09:03:27Z", "content": "The TAKE with Rick Klein Overtime is over in Georgia and Florida now after Democrats ran out of options -- and are short of votes -- in both southern states.

Add Interest\n\nOvertime is over in Georgia and Florida now after Democrats ran out of options -- and are short of votes -- in both southern states.\n\nThat leaves Mississippi looming as a challenge and an opportunity for a party that wants to show it can compete everywhere, and win, even where it's not supposed to.\n\nThere are a few reasons to think that the Mississippi Senate runoff, scheduled for the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, would offer the right mix of circumstances for a Democratic upset. Democrat Mike Espy only advanced to this round of voting because the two major Republicans split votes two weeks ago.\n\nBut Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., has made a series of public statements that raise the stakes on matters of race and voting rights. The issues are all too familiar for Democrats after campaigns that fell short in Georgia and Florida.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., campaigned for Espy over the weekend, calling out \"racism, anti-Semitism, sexism, homophobia.\" Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., will campaign in the state on Monday and President Donald Trump will stump for Hyde-Smith next week, on the eve of the runoff.\n\nThe race is sufficiently nationalized at this point. Democrats who want to sustain momentum from Election Day will face an early -- if not entirely fair -- test.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks\n\nAfter visiting literal scorched earth in California this weekend, Trump cooled his usual slash-and-burn politics.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown said Sunday the president had the state's residents' backs.\n\nAfter first threatening to pull federal funding to the state, the president since promised to send emergency aid.\n\nBrown praised the decision.\n\n\"In the face of tragedy, people tend to rise above some of their lesser propensities,\" Brown said on CBS's Face the Nation. \"So I think we're on a good path.\"\n\nThe president received strong rebukes for his initial comments about land mismanagement, given the Republican Party's silence on climate change and the fact that the federal government actually owns and controls a significant majority of California's forests.\n\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\nThe TIP with John Verhovek\n\nThe area once referred to by President Ronald Reagan as the place where \"good Republicans go to die\" and the home Richard Nixon's presidential library will have no Republican members of Congress come January 2019.\n\nBefore 2016, Orange County, California, hadn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since the Great Depression. And in 2018, Democrats flipped four OC-based congressional districts on their way to reclaiming the House majority.\n\nDemocrats hold 45 of California's 53 seats in the U.S. House, and those members now compose nearly 20 percent of the entire Democratic caucus.\n\nThe result is a testament to Democrats' efforts in the area during June's jungle primary, where they spent millions to ensure that despite all candidates running on one ballot regardless of party, they were not locked out of the general election. It is also undeniably a sign of the shifting political ground in many parts of the country.\n\n\"America used to be a country of regional parties within each party, while both parties are on the path of losing this important representation, the path of the GOP is nearly complete to a nationalized ideological right-wing party,\" ABC News Chief Political Analyst Matthew Dowd said last week.\n\nTHE PLAYLIST\n\nABC News' \"Start Here\" Podcast.

The rebels say they have long been excluded from that government and aim to rectify historic grievances.\n\nRebel leader Mohammed Ali al-Houthi announced in a statement that the rebels had ordered the cessation of rocket and drone attacks on the Saudis and forces loyal to the United Arab Emirates, a leading coalition member, at the request of U.N. envoy Martin Griffiths.\n\n\"We are ready to freeze and stop military operations on all fronts in order to achieve peace,\" al-Houthi said. He mentioned the rockets specifically as part of a longer statement in which he blamed the United States for being the main driver behind \"the aggression\" against Yemen.\n\nThe Houthis swept down from northern Yemen in 2014 and captured the capital, Sanaa, with the help of forces loyal to longtime strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh, who had been forced from power by an Arab Spring-inspired popular uprising. Saleh was killed in internal fighting between the Houthis and their allies last year.\n\nThe government fled Sanaa in early 2015, and Saudi Arabia, citing fears that its nemesis Iran was trying to make inroads on the Arabian Peninsula, began launching airstrikes against the rebels in March of that year.\n\nRiyadh formed a coalition of Sunni Arab states, including the UAE, Kuwait, Egypt and Sudan, and launched ground assaults on several fronts but failed to take the capital. After major setbacks, including the death of some elite officers, it outsourced the ground fighting to local troops, including a group trained by the UAE in the south.\n\nTens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in the war, and two-thirds of Yemen's 27 million people rely on aid. More than 8 million are at risk of starvation in what has become the world's worst humanitarian disaster.\n\nThe latest Saudi-led offensive, which began in the summer, has been focused on capturing the key rebel-held port city of Hodeida, through which almost all of Yemen's food and desperately needed humanitarian aid flows.\n\nA U.N. draft resolution circulated by Britain on Monday urges the warring parties to relaunch peace talks and take urgent steps to address the humanitarian crisis. It also calls for an immediate cease-fire around Hodeida.\n\nGriffiths, the U.N. envoy, announced on Friday that both sides had agreed to attend talks in Sweden \"soon\" aimed at ending the conflict. The internationally backed government said Monday that it would attend, but also insisted the Houthis do so \"unconditionally.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia's King Salman, in an annual policy speech Monday, called Yemen a \"priority\" and said he supports a U.N.-sponsored political solution to end the war. But he also railed against the Houthis, saying Saudi Arabia was supporting the Yemeni people against the \"aggression of Iranian-backed militias.\"\n\nThe coalition has long demanded the rebels withdraw from all major cities they have taken, which the Houthis refuse to do.\n\nIt was not immediately clear to what extent the Houthi move to stop missile fire into the kingdom would halt the overall violence. While the guns have gone silent inside central Hodeida, fighting continues on its outskirts and elsewhere in the country, and several previous peace initiatives have failed.\n\nInternational outrage over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in October focused attention on the war in Yemen, leading the U.S. to scale back its support for the coalition and call for a cease-fire by the end of this month.\n\nBut the U.S. call for a truce was immediately followed by a renewed coalition onslaught on Hodeida, with dozens of fighters and civilians killed on both sides. A week later, the stalemate resumed, with the Houthis still firmly dug in on the city's outskirts.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nRohan reported from Cairo. Associated Press writer Edith M.

The others either made suspect choices or played not to lose.\n\nAnd, naturally, they lost.\n\n\"This is as tough as it gets,\" Jaguars defensive end Calais Campbell said after his bunch blew a 16-0 lead to Pittsburgh and lost on a last-second touchdown by Ben Roethliberger. \"There are going to be some games you definitely lose and you'll definitely win. But when it comes down to that last play, and you're on the losing side of it, those hurt, especially in a situation where we're a desperate team in need of a win.\"\n\nAnd a team that got too many field goals, yet got comfortable with that 16-point edge. Jacksonville stopped being as aggressive as it had been earlier in dominating the Steelers, and pretty much dropped from postseason contention at 3-7.\n\n\"If people are in here and they're content \u2014 not saying anybody is \u2014 but if people are content with losing and things not going right,\" star cornerback Jalen Ramsey said, \"then that's not the type of guys you want on the team and that's not the type of environment you want to have.\"\n\nThe environment might be worse in Arizona, where first-year coach Steve Wilks saw his club make several critical errors down the stretch. That led to a 23-21 loss to Oakland, of all teams \u2014 the Raiders were the only team with just one victory heading into the weekend \u2014 that never should have been a defeat.\n\nA dropped pass by running back David Johnson hurt. An unnecessary roughness penalty against Cardinals tight end Jermaine Gresham cost 15 yards and stopped the game clock. On the next play, Johnson ran 57 yards for what was sure to be the clinching score, only to have the play called back on a holding call against tight end Ricky Seals-Jones.\n\nTwo plays later, the Cardinals punted. The Raiders drove 63 yards against a modified prevent defense and won as the clock expired on Daniel Carlson's 35-yard field goal.\n\n\"It was just a dumb play by me,\" Gresham, a nine-year veteran, said after the game. \"I turned around and saw my guy on the ground. We're not coached to that. We're not taught that. They didn't bring me in here to do that, and it was stupid. I cost us the game.\"\n\nNot entirely, but he helped.\n\nThe Chargers had plenty of culprits, too. Their six-game winning string ended when a conservative defense couldn't prevent Denver from going 86 yards in 1:51 for Brandon McManus' winning 34-yard field goal as time expired.\n\nLos Angeles made mistakes throughout, hardly looking like a wild-card front-runner. Philip Rivers threw two interceptions and on a third-down play on LA's final drive, he seemed to panic and threw the ball at a receiver's feet. That led to a punt, but also gave Denver more time for its final drive than it should have gotten.\n\nThe Chargers committed 14 penalties, including 10 in the first half. Mike Badgley, who made three field goals, also missed an extra point. Denver won 23-22.\n\n\"The crucial mistakes that we've been able to stay away from, we didn't today,\" Rivers said.\n\nChampionship candidates avoid those, especially against a weaker opponent.\n\nAtlanta has had plenty of reasons to struggle, particularly a slew of early-season injuries that have worn on a good roster. But the Falcons had won three straight before a poor performance in Cleveland, and they exacerbated their issues with a difficult-to-watch showing late in a 22-19 loss to Dallas on Sunday.\n\nFour of the team's six losses have come either on the opponent's final possession or with the Falcons denied on their final opportunity. Simply put, the Falcons have folded under pressure.\n\n\"It's aggravating at the end of the day,\" said cornerback Robert Alford. \"... We did do some good things today. We can't just hold our heads down. But at the end of the day we've got to learn to finish games.\"\n\nThis time, the Cowboys had little difficulty moving 51 yards to Brett Maher's winning 42-yard kick.\n\nIf your team is going to lose late, at least do it the way Carolina did \u2014 going for it, not backing off or making egregious errors.\n\n\"When you make some errors we made today in critical moments, you open yourselves up to get beat, and that's what happened today,\" Rivers said. \"We had every opportunity to close it out, and we just didn't get it done.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP\u2014NFL"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Turbulent stock market spooks some older workers, retirees", "description": "Recent turbulence in the U.S. stock markets is spooking some older workers and retirees, a group that was hit particularly hard during the most recent financial crisis", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/turbulent-stock-markets-spooking-older-workers-retirees-59286644", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/WireAP_d8b2d4217018415eb877e09fe88cc8fc_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T07:07:26Z", "content": "The recent turbulence in the U.S. stock market s is spooking some older workers and retirees, a group that was hit particularly hard during the most recent financial crisis.

I'm not taking that risk,\" says Mark Patterson, a recently retired patent attorney from Nashville, Tennessee. \"There's a huge fear of folks my age that they're going to run out of money and they're going to need to rely on the government for help.\"\n\nBy the time the market bottomed out during the financial crisis in 2009, an estimated $2.7 trillion had been wiped out of Americans' retirement accounts, according to the Urban Institute. Older Americans, in particular, have had a tough time recovering their losses. The Pew Research Center estimates the net worth of the median Baby Boomer household in 2016 was still nearly 18 percent shy of where it sat in 2007.\n\nIn the two years since Donald Trump's election, 62 percent of Americans \u2014 and 76 percent of those 65 and over \u2014 don't believe their financial situation has improved despite the run-up in the stock markets, according to a recent Bankrate survey. Nearly 1 in 5 respondents said their finances have actually gotten worse.\n\nPaul Kelash, vice president of consumer insights at Allianz Life Insurance Co., says the market fluctuations throughout 2018 look less like the prelude to a retirement savings crisis and more like a return to normalcy after a remarkably steady market run.\n\nAs such, he hasn't seen much evidence of Americans drastically altering their retirement plans. \"We get the feeling that folks are getting more comfortable with volatility,\" he says.\n\nPatterson, the recently retired patent attorney, gradually began stepping away from his law practice in 2016 \u2014 a decision he says was motivated in part by the stress of his job, his relatively stable finances and a \"re-evaluation of priorities\" after losing his wife of 35 years in 2013.\n\nNow, 68, Patterson says he still has some \"discretionary spending\" money invested in stocks and riskier assets. But he says he was reluctant to put too much money into a stock market that soared throughout 2017, a decision he says was driven in part by memories of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\"I can retire in 2018 and not be sweating bullets because I put together a budget and I protected it,\" Patterson says. \"The thing that the crash in 2008 taught me is that, even though my portfolio was well set up, that was a black swan type of event. Even if you had a balanced portfolio, everything went down.\"\n\nIndeed, memories of the recession continue to take a financial and psychological toll on many of those who were affected.\n\n\"There is no evidence that retirement wealth has improved in the last few years,\" says Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist, professor and director of the Retirement Equity Lab at The New School. For workers 50 to 65, there are indications wealth has actually fallen, she said.\n\nGhilarducci notes that workers and their employers stopped or cut back on 401(k) and retirement account contributions immediately after the financial crisis. Many also opted to \"deleverage\" and pay down debt as the recovery got underway, she says, which tied up money that otherwise would have been saved or invested.\n\n\"They had other things to do with their money, even if they didn't lose their job,\" she says. \"Saving is sort of a luxury good. It's what you can do when you can pay for everything else.\"\n\nAnd with a limited number of working years ahead of them \u2014 and, in some cases, their peak earning years largely behind them \u2014 many older Americans haven't managed to replenish their depleted retirement and savings accounts.\n\nMark Hamrick, the Washington bureau chief and senior economic analyst at Bankrate, notes that the Federal Reserve's ongoing efforts to boost interest rates benefit savers with money in the bank but also make it more difficult for those with debt to pay back what they owe. The \"rising economic tide\" has been a boon for many, he says, \"but it doesn't lift all boats.\"\n\nHe believes there's a tendency to \"overgeneralize\" Americans' retirement situations and their day-to-day reactions to the economy.\n\n\"There can be a little bit of a disconnect between the improvement in the economic data and the actual experience of many Americans,\" he says.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE \u2014 Andrew Soergel is studying aging and workforce issues as part of a 10-month fellowship at The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, which joins NORC's independent research and AP journalism.

Hot blasts of pyroclastic material pushed down canyons on the slopes, while a column of ash rose nearly 23,000 feet (7,000 meters) above sea level and drifted toward Guatemala City to the east.\n\nHundreds of families heeded the call of disaster coordination authorities to evacuate 10 communities, piling into yellow school buses for trips to shelters.

Another 234 are officially missing, although organizations supporting the communities have insisted there are thousands of missing persons.\n\nIt spewed more ash and hot rock in October, prompting warnings for the nearby communities.\n\nThe biggest danger from the volcano are lahars, a mixture of ash, rock, mud and debris, that can bury entire towns. On Monday, there had been no reports of such flows reaching populated areas, though authorities were taking no chances; they were harshly criticized for not calling for evacuations earlier in June.\n\nFour shelters have been set up for evacuees.

Roy Blunt of Missouri, who has received a confidential intelligence briefing on the matter, told ABC that \"it's hard to imagine\" that the crown prince didn't know about the killing, but he said, \"I don't know that we absolutely know that yet.\"\n\nHe said that Congress will await the Trump administration's report in the next two days and that the U.S. will need to be clear about the ramifications of sanctions, given Saudi Arabia's strategic role in the Middle East.\n\nFor his part, Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, said the crown prince has been a \"wrecking ball\" in the relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"I hate to say that because I had a lot of hope for him being the reformer that Saudi Arabia needs, but that ship has sailed as far as Lindsey Graham's concerned,\" the South Carolina Republican told NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\n\"I have no intention of working with him ever again,\" said Graham, who is in line to be the next chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nIntelligence officials have been providing information to Trump for weeks about the death, and he was briefed again by phone Saturday by CIA Director Gina Haspel and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as he flew to California. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders provided no details of his call but said the president has confidence in the CIA.\n\n\"The United States government is determined to hold all those responsible for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi accountable,\" the State Department said in a statement. \"Recent reports indicating that the U.S. government has made a final conclusion are inaccurate. There remain numerous unanswered questions with respect to the murder of Mr. Khashoggi.\"\n\nThe statement added: \"The U.S. government has taken decisive measures against the individuals responsible, including visa and sanctions actions. We will continue to explore additional measures to hold those accountable who planned, led and were connected to the murder. And, we will do that while maintaining the important strategic relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nBefore his call on Air Force One, Trump told reporters that when it came to the crown prince, \"as of this moment we were told that he did not play a role. We're going to have to find out what they have to say.\" That echoed remarks by national security adviser John Bolton, who said earlier this week that people who have listened to an audio recording of the killing do not think it implicates the crown prince.\n\nGermany's foreign minister on Monday said Berlin had banned 18 Saudi nationals from entering Europe's border-free Schengen zone because they are believed to be connected to Khashoggi's killing. Heiko Maas told reporters in Brussels on Monday that Germany issued the ban for the 26-nation zone in close coordination with France, which is part of the Schengen area, and Britain, which is not. He said the 18 Saudis are \"allegedly connected to this crime\" but gave no further information and didn't release their names.\n\nTrump has called the killing a botched operation that was carried out very poorly and has said \"the cover-up was one of the worst cover-ups in the history of cover-ups.\"\n\nBut he has resisted calls to cut off arms sales to the kingdom and has been reluctant to antagonize the Saudi rulers. Trump considers the Saudis vital allies in his Mideast agenda.\n\nBut members of Congress are pushing Trump for a tougher response to the killing. The administration this past week penalized 17 Saudi officials for their alleged role in the killing, but American lawmakers have called on the administration to curtail arms sales to Saudi Arabia or take other harsher punitive measures.\n\nTurkish and Saudi authorities say Khashoggi, a Saudi who lived in the United States, was killed inside the consulate by a team from the kingdom after he went there to get marriage documents."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "AP FACT CHECK: Trump's misdirection on Calif fires, climate", "description": "AP FACT CHECK: Trump asserts that California's forest management is mostly to blame for its devastating wildfires, but he is minimizing the impact of climate change and the federal government's responsibilities", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/ap-fact-check-trumps-misdirection-calif-fires-climate-59286337", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/WireAP_b14988d6b62c4408aa548349ecb255e8_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T06:10:13Z", "content": "President Donald Trump is going too far in assigning most of the blame for California's devastating wildfire s on the state's forest management.

But most of California's 33 million acres of forests are under federal or private control, not the state's. Fire scientists say that Trump also neglects a larger effect from climate change in promoting abnormally dry conditions and dead trees, creating fuel for fire.\n\nIn a week honoring the sacrifice of America's warriors, Trump appeared to claim that he visited Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day last year and asserted that veterans, thanks to him, no longer face long waits for medical care. Neither is true.\n\nCapping the weekend, the president also misspelled the name of a Democratic lawmaker in an unfortunate way and did not correct himself.\n\nA look at his recent statements, compared with the facts:\n\nCALIFORNIA WILDFIRES\n\nTRUMP, speaking about the role of forest management in stemming wildfires: \"I was with the president of Finland and he said, 'We have a much different\u2014we're a forest nation.' He called it a forest nation, and they spent a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things. And they don't have any problem.\" \u2014 remarks Saturday in Paradise, California.\n\nTHE FACTS: Finland apparently is not raking that many leaves.\n\nPresident Sauli Niinisto said in an interview published Sunday in the Ilta-Sanomat newspaper that he told Trump during a brief meeting in Paris on Nov. 11 that \"Finland is a country covered by forests but we also have a good surveillance system and network\" in case of wildfires.\n\nNiinisto said he told Trump \"we take care of our forests,\" but he couldn't recall mentioning anything on raking.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTRUMP, on the role of climate change: \"Maybe it contributes a little bit. The big problem we have is management...You need forest management. It has to be. I'm not saying that in a negative way, a positive \u2014 I'm just saying the facts.\" \u2014 interview with \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nTRUMP: \"There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\" \u2014 tweet on Nov. 10.\n\nTHE FACTS: Both nature and humans share responsibility for the state's devastating wildfires, but fire scientists say the forest management is not the main contributor.\n\nNature provides the dangerous winds that have whipped the fires, and human-caused climate change over the long haul is killing and drying the shrubs and trees that provide the fuel. That's not to say California is blameless: Urban development encroaching on wildlands also is a factor. But about 19 million or 57 percent of California's 33 million acres of forests are managed or owned by the federal government, according to the University of California.\n\nThe wildfire that incinerated the Northern California town of Paradise and surrounding areas is the single deadliest such blaze in California history.\n\nThe other major fire, in Southern California, has burned through shrubland, not forest.\n\n\"It's not about forest management,\" said University of Utah fire scientist Philip Dennison. \"These aren't forests.\"\n\nThe dean of the University of Michigan's environmental school, Jonathan Overpeck, said Western fires are getting bigger and more severe. He said it \"is much less due to bad management and is instead the result of our baking of our forests, woodlands and grasslands with ever-worsening climate change.\"\n\nWildfires have become more devastating because of the extreme weather swings from global warming, fire scientists said. The average number of U.S. acres burned by wildfires has doubled from 30 years ago.\n\nCalifornia also has been in drought for all but a few years of the 21st century and is now experiencing its longest drought, which began on Dec. 27, 2011, and has lasted 358 weeks, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Nearly two-thirds of the state is abnormally dry.\n\nThe first nine months of the year have been fourth-warmest on record for California, and this past summer was the second-hottest on record in the state.\n\nBecause of that, there are 129 million dead trees, which provide fuel for fires.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMIDTERM ELECTIONS\n\nTRUMP: \"We picked up two seats in the Senate. We went from 51-49 to 53-47.\" \u2014 remarks Saturday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Not so. He's presuming Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith will defeat Democrat Mike Espy in a runoff election Nov. 27. If Espy wins, Republicans will have picked up only one seat and have a 52-48 edge. It'll be 53-47 if she wins.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nRUSSIA INVESTIGATION\n\nTRUMP: \"So funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate, but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate!\" \u2014 tweet Sunday.\n\nTHE FACTS: The correct name of the Democratic lawmaker is Adam Schiff.\n\nMueller's appointment to lead the investigation into 2016 election interference and possible ties between Moscow and Trump's campaign was not put to the Senate because special counsels are appointed by the Justice Department. His appointment is not in legal dispute.\n\nCritics contend Trump illegally sidestepped procedure by appointing Whitaker over Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who's been confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTRUMP, on special counsel Robert Mueller and his team conducting the Russia investigation: \"These are Angry People, including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for 8 years.\" \u2014tweet Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Mueller, a longtime Republican, was chosen to lead the FBI by Republican President George W. Bush in 2001. Democratic President Barack Obama kept him in the job, and Mueller left in September 2013 after six years under Obama.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nVETERANS\n\nTRUMP, on his decision not to visit Arlington National Cemetery last week to commemorate Veterans Day: \"In retrospect, I should have, and I did last year and I will virtually every year. But we had come in very late at night and I had just left, literally, the American Cemetery in Paris, and I really probably assumed that was fine and I was extremely busy because of affairs of state \u2014 doing other things.\" \u2014 interview with \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: While Trump has visited Arlington National Cemetery twice during his presidency on Memorial Day, he did not do so last year on Veterans Day. He was in Asia at the time.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTRUMP: \"In June, I proudly signed into law the most significant VA reform in half a century, called Veterans Choice. ... Now if a veteran cannot get the treatment they need from the VA in a timely manner, they can see a private doctor. They don't have to wait 12 days or 20 days. ... There is no more waiting on lines.\" \u2014 remarks at veterans' event Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He continues to spread a misleading claim about veterans now receiving immediate medical care because of his improvements. In fact, the care provided under the Veterans Choice program is not as instantaneous as Trump suggests nor will it necessarily be the biggest overhaul at the Department of Veterans Affairs in decades.\n\nTrump signed legislation in June to expand the private-sector Choice program, which was first approved in 2014 during the Obama administration after a scandal at the Phoenix VA medical center in which some veterans died while waiting months for appointments. The current Choice program allows veterans to see doctors outside the VA system if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment \u2014 not \"12 days or 20 days.\" But many are waiting much longer than the program prescribes.\n\nHow much Choice will be expanded under his law will depend on yet-to-be-completed regulations that will determine eligibility for veterans as well as available money for the program. The VA has yet to resolve long-term financing due to congressional budget caps that could put money for VA or other domestic programs at risk of shortfalls next year.\n\nThe program's success will also depend on an overhaul of the VA's electronic medical records to allow seamless sharing of medical records with private physicians, expected to take up to 10 years.\n\nMeanwhile, the current Choice program isn't always timely. A report released this year by the Government Accountability Office found that despite the Choice program's guarantee of providing an appointment within 30 days, veterans waited an average of 51 days to 64 days.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTRUMP: \"Veteran unemployment has reached its lowest level in nearly 21 years, and it's going to be better.\" \u2014 remarks Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: The veterans' unemployment rate fell to 2.9 percent in October, the latest data available, but that is still higher than the 2.7 percent rate reached in October 2017, also under Trump. That was the lowest joblessness rate for veterans in nearly 17 years.\n\nVeterans' unemployment has fallen mostly for the same reasons that joblessness has dropped generally: strong hiring and steady economic growth for the past eight years.\n\nIn May 2000, veterans' unemployment dropped to a low of 2.3 percent, and he hasn't reached that.\n\nIn any event, it's impossible for Trump to claim an achievement not seen in 21 years on veterans' unemployment. The data on joblessness for vets only go back 18 years, to 2000.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNATO\n\nTRUMP: \"Emmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia. But it was Germany in World Wars One & Two - How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along. Pay for NATO or not!\" \u2014 tweet Tuesday.\n\nTRUMP: \"President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\" \u2014 tweet on Nov. 9.\n\nTHE FACTS: Macron never suggested assembling a European army to stand against the United States, its steadfast military ally. Instead, he joined German Chancellor Angela Merkel in proposing a continental army that would give Europe more responsibility for its own security, supplementing NATO. Trump has repeatedly pushed NATO members to spend more on their own military capabilities to relieve pressure on the U.S. to protect Europe. A European army would be aimed at doing that, though in theory outside the NATO umbrella.\n\nMacron said in a radio interview before Trump's arrival in France that Europe should be able to defend itself more than it now can, without only relying on the United States.\n\nAt another point in the interview, Macron discussed hacking and other cyberthreats and asserted that on that front, France must protect itself from China, Russia and even the United States. His concern about U.S. hackers had nothing to do with military threats or forces.\n\nTrump misrepresented Macron's position on the matter before they met and again after they discussed it.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWHITE HOUSE\n\nSARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, on a judge's order that CNN reporter Jim Acosta be allowed back into the White House: \"Today, the court made clear that there is no absolute First Amendment right to access the White House.\" \u2014 statement Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: The court made no such determination. U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly issued a ruling of a \"limited nature\" that restored Acosta's credentials temporarily while a CNN lawsuit against the Trump administration proceeds. Kelly essentially found support for CNN's claim under the Fifth Amendment that Acosta hadn't received sufficient notice or explanation before his credentials were pulled. As a result, the judge didn't get to the First Amendment issues in the case.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTRADE\n\nTRUMP: \"On Trade, France makes excellent wine, but so does the U.S. The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France, and charges big Tariffs, whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines, and charges very small Tariffs. Not fair, must change!\" \u2014 tweet Tuesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Yes, U.S. wine is desired in France.\n\nTrump, who's been in the wine business, is wrong about France applying tariffs. The European Union does.\n\nHe's right about a disparity in wine duties.\n\nTariffs vary by alcohol content and other factors. A bottle of white American wine with 13 percent alcohol content imported into the EU carries a customs duty of 10 euro cents (just over 11 U.S. cents). A bottle of white wine from the EU exported to the United States has a customs duty of 5 U.S. cents.\n\nThe gap in duties is narrower for red wine with an alcohol content of 14.5 percent.\n\nBulk wines are another story. The U.S. tariff is double the EU one, a break for American producers because bulk wine represents 25 percent of the volume of U.S. wine coming into the EU, according to the French wine exporter federation.\n\nThe value of wine imported by France has jumped 200 percent over a decade. Meantime Americans are the top consumers of French wine exports.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nVOTER ID\n\nTRUMP: \"The disgrace is that, voter ID. If you buy, you know, a box of cereal, if you do anything, you have a voter ID ...The only thing you don't is if you're a voter of the United States.\" \u2014 interview Wednesday with The Daily Caller.\n\nTHE FACTS: He is meaning to say that shoppers use a photo ID to make purchases, so it should not be a burden to show a photo ID for voting. But as shoppers know, no photo is required to purchase a box of cereal or other items at a grocery store when using cash or to make routine purchases with credit or debit cards.\n\nIdentifications are required to purchase limited items such as alcohol, cigarettes or cold medicine and in rapidly declining situations in which a customer opts to pay with a personal check.\n\nAccording to the National Grocers Association's most recent data, the use of checks as a percentage of total transactions dropped from 33 percent in 2000 to 6 percent in 2015, due in part to the popularity of debit cards, which use PIN codes. The group's members are independent food retailers, family-owned or privately held, both large and small.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Jessica Gresko, Darlene Superville, Christopher Rugaber and Seth Borenstein contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Rain could hinder search for victims of California wildfire", "description": "Rain in the forecast could bring relief for those working to tame a devastating Northern California fire and frustration for those searching for remains of victims", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/rain-hinder-search-victims-california-wildfire-59286167", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/WireAP_c58e7a901e9844fabeb7b0e1de0b548e_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T05:40:34Z", "content": "The search for remains of victims of the devastating Northern California wildfire has taken on new urgency as rain in the forecast could complicate those efforts while also bringing relief to firefighters on the front lines.

They won't confirm it to me the whole time,\" Taft said Monday.\n\nWith 79 people killed in the nation's deadliest wildfire in at least a century, there are still nearly 700 names on the list of those unaccounted for. While it's down from nearly 1,000 the day before, it is inexact, progress has been slow, and the many days of uncertainty are adding to the stress.\n\nMore than a dozen people are marked as \"unknowns,\" without first or last names. In some cases, names are listed twice or more times under different spellings. Others are confirmed dead, and their names simply haven't been taken off yet.\n\nSurvivors and relatives of those caught in the fire in Northern California are using social media to get the word out: In some cases, to post that their loved ones were safe; in others, to plead for help.\n\n\"Aunt Dorothy is still missing.

He has called it \"raw data\" compiled from phone calls, emails and other reports.\n\n\"We put the list out. It will fluctuate. It will go up. It will go down because this is in a state of flux,\" Honea said Monday. \"My view on this has been that I would prefer to get the information out and start working to find who is unaccounted for and who is not. I would put progress over perfection.\"\n\nOfficials have also culled reports from the earliest hours of the disaster, when fire knocked out mobile phone communications and thousands fled, some to safe shelter that was hundreds of miles away.\n\nHonea said his office was working with the Red Cross to account for people entering and leaving shelters. Evacuees are also helping authorities narrow the list, sometimes by chance.\n\nRobert James Miles, who lost his Paradise trailer in the blaze, was staying at a shelter in Chico where people posted names of those they hadn't heard from. Miles said he alerted a Red Cross worker Saturday that he recognized eight names on the board as friends he knew were OK.\n\n\"Two of them were in the shelter,\" he said with a chuckle.\n\nOwen and Phyllis Suihkonen understand the chaos. Their family is scattered after they lost their home to the wildfire, as did their two adult children.\n\nPhyllis Suihkonen, 69, says she spotted the names of two friends on the list of unaccounted people, and doesn't know if they are safe. But her daughter has seen names of friends who are OK and called sheriff's officials to let them know.\n\n\"I'm concerned,\" Phyllis said. \"But like I said, there's been other friends' names on the list that have been accounted for and taken off.\"\n\nMeanwhile, those searching for bodies were in a race against the weather, as rain was forecast for Wednesday. The precipitation could help knock out the flames, but it could also hinder the search by washing away fragmentary remains and turning ash into a thick paste.\n\nThe fire, which burned at least 236 square miles (611 square kilometers) and destroyed nearly 12,000 homes, was 70 percent contained on Monday.\n\nAlcatraz Island, San Francisco's cable cars, the Oakland Zoo and other San Francisco Bay Area area attractions were closed Monday because of smoke from the blaze some 140 miles (225 kilometers) away. Several San Francisco museums over the weekend offered free admission to give people something to do indoors.\n\nCalifornia Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said it is \"way too early\" to estimate the damage done by the wildfire. But for perspective, he said the Northern California fires that gutted 6,800 homes last year resulted in $12.6 billion in insured losses.\n\n\"It's going to be a long and painful process,\" he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHar reported from San Francisco.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press journalists Kathleen Ronayne in Sacramento, California, and Paul Elias and Jocelyn Gecker in San Francisco also contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Death of young Thai kickboxer brings focus on dangers", "description": "The sight of two preteen boys pummeling each other with fists, elbows, knees and feet as a boisterous crowd shouts wagers is considered good, clean sport in Thailand, but a boy's recent death may bring changes", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/death-young-thai-kickboxer-brings-focus-dangers-59286439", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_139e1a12a8e14df681758008b9b4559c_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T05:39:41Z", "content": "The sight of two preteen boys pummeling each other with fists, elbows, knees and feet as a boisterous crowd shouts wagers at each other is considered good, clean sport in Thailand.

They said that the referee did not stop the fight soon enough, and that no doctor was available.\n\nBut even those boys who can carry on fighting are almost guaranteed serious long-term health damage, according to a new report by a Thai doctor.\n\nThai lawmakers recently suggested barring children younger than 12 from competitive boxing, but boxing enthusiasts strongly oppose the change. They say the sport is part of Thai culture and gives poor families the opportunity to raise a champion that will lift their economic circumstances.\n\nAnucha was born in the poor northeastern province of Kalasin and raised by his grandparents since his parents split up when he was 3. Anucha was already becoming his family's breadwinner when his uncle, a physical education teacher and boxing trainer, brought him to the Bangkok suburb of Samut Prakarn around a year ago to pursue a big-time boxing career.\n\nAnucha's days started at 4:30 a.m. with a run and light training at the boxing gym. He attended school from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. before heading back to the gym for more training until 8 p.m. Bedtime was 10 p.m.\n\nTapakorn Takimnok, 15, a fellow boxer and a friend of Anucha, said he woke up the younger boy every day and never once heard him complain.\n\n\"He'd spring right out of bed every time I woke him up,\" said Tapakorn. \"He always trained hard and kept any emotions to himself.\"\n\nAnucha could occasionally earn as much as 10,000 to 40,000 baht ($300 to $1,200) for each fight he won, which he would give to his grandparents, siblings and uncles, Tapakorn said, adding that Anucha earned more than other young fighters because he fought often and was considered a gifted boxer. Young amateur boxers typically earn around 500 to 1,000 baht ($15 to 30) a fight.\n\n\"I told him to stop boxing,\" said Anucha's 75-year-old grandmother, Subin Tasako. \"He told me: Grandma, what else can I do? I'm young and I can't work. If I stop boxing, how would I earn money to pay for school or support you? That's what he said.\" Subin said she didn't know how to respond.\n\nFootage of Anucha's fatal fight, posted online by Thai media outlets, show him briefly stumbling to the floor after taking a knee to his leg from his opponent. He picks himself back up, and the referee promptly allows the fight to resume, but Anucha appears to have had the fight knocked out of him.\n\nMoments later, he is staggering and defenseless against the ropes, as his opponent lands at least four hard punches to Anucha's head, leaving him dazed, and perhaps even unconscious before he hits the floor and bangs his head hard on the mat.\n\nDr. Witaya Sungkarat, a doctor from Ramathibodi Hospital in Bangkok, spent five years conducting a study published last month that compared brain development between young boxers and children not involved with the sport.\n\nThe study's results clearly show that boxing causes irreparable damage to a young child's developing brain, he said, adding that the longer each participant had boxed, the worse their condition became.\n\n\"If we keep letting children box and injure their brains without implementing measures to protect them, their futures are predictable,\" Witaya said.\n\nWitaya understands part of the sport's appeal. \"People like to watch children box because they don't lose on purpose and they genuinely fight each other,\" he said, referring to the common perception that many professional boxing matches are fixed to accommodate bookies.\n\nBut Anucha's case, he said, shows how inadequate oversight in the Thai boxing industry had led young boxers to be overworked.\n\n\"It's the system that abused him. The system allowed him to fight this much and this often at such a young age,\" Witaya said. \"There's a loophole in the system that allowed him to become a professional fighter without any preventive measures.\"\n\nWitaya referenced a provision allowing children to be paid \"rewards\" rather than being paid compensation for work. And while professional Muay Thai titles are only open to competitors age 15 or older and two major Bangkok stadiums have weight minimums, children can fight in unofficial matches outside the World Muay Thai Council supervision with a guardian's permission.\n\nSukrit Parekrithawet, a lawyer who represents several boxing camps, said the recently proposed legislation to regulate the sport was conceived by outsiders who do not understand it.\n\nHe cited the success of former Thai boxing Olympic gold medalists such as Somluck Kamsing, who began his boxing career at the tender age of 7. Like many top-tier Muay Thai boxers, he made a transition to more lucrative conventional boxing, and became the first Thai athlete to win an Olympic gold medal, in the featherweight boxing competition in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.\n\n\"If these guys did not start fighting at a young age would they be world champions today?\" Sukrit said, adding his opinion that allowing children to box is not dangerous because the blows are not as forceful.\n\nAt the Jitmuangnon Gym in Bangkok, 10-year-old Chaichana Saengngern rises every day at around 4 a.m. to train before going to school, then returning to work out some more. He has 20 bouts under his belt since first stepping into the ring at the age of 8.\n\n\"He needs to fight in real matches to be a good fighter,\" said Chaichana's uncle, Suthep Saengngern, speaking days after Anucha's death. \"He can't just dance around in the gym.\"\n\nSuthep said he doesn't support banning children from boxing because it would rob many poor Thai families of the chance for their offspring to become professional athletes.\n\n\"Every family's economic background is different. People with money send their kids to play golf, tennis, swimming or shooting. But poor people can't do that. We can only do boxing. This is our option,\" Suthep said."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Japan exports up in October, but not enough to erase deficit", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Administration officials are endorsing giving greater rights to those accused of sexual assault on campus and pushing back against race-based affirmative action in admissions.\n\nCarly Thomsen, a professor of feminist studies at Vermont's Middlebury College, dismissed the complaints as a backlash against women's activism and the #MeToo movement.\n\n\"They are trying to dress up their desire to hold on to power as an equity issue,\" Thomsen said.\n\nThe complaints under investigation by the Education Department describe opportunities that appear to exclude men.\n\nThe Yale Women Innovators, a weekly event series, is discriminatory, Pekgoz argues, because it says it is open to \"all Yale women and non-binary femme students, alumni, faculty staff, and community members.\" At Princeton, he said in another complaint, the university treats male students unfairly by offering a course on defending against sexual assault only to women.\n\n\"Everything should be available on a gender-neutral basis,\" Pekgoz said.\n\nThe Education Department is also looking into whether the Cagney and Lacey Fellowship at the University of Southern California shows prejudice against male applicants because it is awarded to \"a returning woman student.\"\n\nYale and USC said they are committed to nondiscrimination. Princeton said the school is providing the Education Department with the necessary information. Following the complaint, Tulane University is considering how to administer women's empowerment programs \"without regard to their sex.\"\n\nThe Education Department said in a statement that it enforces Title IX so that \"all students, including men, have equal access to educational opportunity and can go to school without fear of sex discrimination.\" It would not comment on specific investigations.\n\nPeter Lake, a professor of education and law at Florida's Stetson University, sees the recent complaints as a \"counterbalancing trend.\"\n\n\"Because there has been so much energy thrown toward women's rights primarily, one might expect that men might step up and say 'What about us?' and argue that they are subject to certain inequities that need to be addressed,\" Lake said.\n\nSince Title IX was passed in 1972, women have successfully used the law to win access to athletic and educational opportunities and to combat sexual harassment on campuses. The Obama administration expanded protections for victims of sexual assault, making it easier to bring complaints and hold schools to task if they ignored them. Some critics said that those Obama guidelines were unfair to the accused and violated due process."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Rhodes scholar class features plenty of women, immigrants", "description": "Latest Rhodes scholar group includes 21 women, the most ever in a single class.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/latest-us-rhodes-scholar-class-includes-women-59276735", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/WireAP_64c9cd9efe7e4c44bb1897244c9d5630_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-19T01:25:24Z", "content": "The latest crop of U.S. Rhodes scholars has more women than any other single class, and almost half of this year's recipients of the prestigious scholarship to Oxford University in England are either immigrants or first-generation Americans, the Rhodes Trust \u2026 [+2855 chars]", "fulltext": "The latest crop of U.S. Rhodes scholars has more women than any other single class, and almost half of this year's recipients of the prestigious scholarship to Oxford University in England are either immigrants or first-generation Americans, the Rhodes Trust announced Sunday.\n\nAmong the 32 winners is Harvard University senior Jin Park, the first recipient covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama-era program that shields young immigrants from deportation.\n\nPark, 22, of the New York City borough of Queens, arrived from South Korea with his parents when he was 7, studied molecular and cellular biology at Harvard, and founded a nonprofit to help undocumented students apply to college.\n\nHe hopes to become an immigrant advocate, saying it's important for him to use the opportunity to better others, not just himself.\n\n\"When you grow up as an undocumented immigrant in America, that understanding that your talents don't really belong to you in the traditional sense, that you have to share the fruits of your labor with others, that's just something you learn,\" Park said.\n\nAlaleh Azhir, a 21-year old senior at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, emigrated from Iran when she was 14 \u2014 and is also one of 21 female scholars named Sunday.

When the brusnahans adopted her giving her two brothers, one of whom was also adopted, and two parents. Then, not long ago, Katie's mom told her about a phone call she'd received. And she tells me that Nikki, my birth mother, had another baby. And that the social workers wanted us to foster her. And I was like, okay, let's do it. Reporter: Which is how loulou, Katie's half sister, two decades her junior, became a temporary member of the household. Till another family could be found. At least that was the plan. The brusnahan parents, after all, were looking at their 60s. Probably most people our age are doing it as grandparents. Reporter: But loulou got to them. We all fell in love with her immediately.
