The 65-year-old Earvin sustained 15 rib fractures and two dozen or more abrasions, hemorrhages and lacerations. Surgery to remove a portion of his bowel appears to have followed the injury, the report says.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the May 17 incident at the prison in Mount Sterling, about 250 miles (400 kilometers) southwest of Chicago. Illinois Department of Corrections officials declined to disclose details of the altercation.\n\nAt least four Western Illinois employees were placed on administrative leave with pay on May 22, according to documents provided under the Freedom of Information Act. Suspended for allegedly violating conduct standards were correctional Sgt. Willie Hedden, 40, of Mount Sterling; correctional Lts. Benjamin Burnett, 33, of Winchester, and Blake Haubrich, 30, of Quincy and correctional officer Alex Banta, 27, of Quincy.\n\nEarvin was black. The race of the officers allegedly involved in the altercation is uncertain.\n\nEarvin, serving a six-year sentence for a Cook County robbery and scheduled for release in September, was airlifted to a regional hospital after the incident , Corrections spokeswoman Lindsey Hess said in July. He died six weeks after he was airlifted, on June 26, at Centralia Correctional Center, according to the death certificate signed by Clinton County Coroner Phillip Moss.\n\nMoss declined comment. So did Dr. Gershom Norfleet, the St. Louis forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy with special agents from the FBI and Illinois State Police and a state police crime scene investigator attending.\n\nNeither FBI spokesman Brad Ware nor Hess would comment on the autopsy.\n\n\"The IDOC (corrections department) has cooperated fully with federal authorities and, as per FBI policy, we are not allowed to discuss details regarding an investigation,\" Hess said in an email.\n\nIn addition to the broken ribs and multiple abrasions which showed signs of healing at the time of death, Earvin had pneumonia, a tracheostomy tube and a chest tube to drain fluids, all associated with chest trauma, according to Norfleet's findings. Under the heading \"blunt abdominal trauma,\" the report says that a portion of Earvin's colon had been removed surgically and an ileostomy bag installed for waste removal.\n\nIn Earvin's system were morphine and Hydrocodone for pain and drugs used for anxiety and depression. He also had severe narrowing of the aorta, high blood pressure, cirrhosis and Hepatitis C.\n\nThe death certificate indicates that Earvin was born in an unknown Mississippi city. He was sentenced to six years in prison in 2015 for theft of merchandise under $300 in Cook County. His rap sheet also includes a seven-year stretch in 2004 for aggravated arson and previous convictions for retail theft, burglary, theft and attempted burglary dating to 1984.\n\nThe AP has been unable to locate any members of Earvin's family.\n\nHedden, Burnett, Haubrich and Banta were placed on administrative leave for \"violations of standards of conduct pending investigation,\" documents show. Hess declined comment on the officers' current status and would not confirm their suspensions were connected to the Earvin incident. But in the department's response to the AP's request for their disciplinary records, the department indicated it was withholding relevant documents because the \"FBI is the primary investigative agency in this matter and has determined that a release of these records would jeopardize the investigation.\"\n\nHedden declined comment when contacted. Messages left after calling numbers associated with the other correctional staff, Burnett, Haubrich and Banta, were not returned.\n\nThe corrections department initially said it didn't have any documents related to the incident. It denied AP's first request for records in July, and when the news organization appealed to the attorney general's public access counselor, the department responded that it had turned everything in its possession over to the FBI , and didn't even have copies of its own investigative reports. It later acknowledged it had found copies.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said that people in the caravan will not be able to enter the U.S. illegally \"no matter what,\" and many members of the Trump administration, including the president himself, have accused members of the caravan of being terrorists or gang members.\n\nAlfredo Estrella/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMany migrants have said that what spurs them on are the terrible conditions at home: Central America is wracked with violence and poverty, corruption and impunity.\n\nBut for LGBT migrants, the threat of violence is, in many cases, even greater, a 2017 Amnesty International report found, and \"gay men and trans women are exposed to gender-based violence at every point on their journey in search of protection.\" Amnesty listed Mexico and Honduras among seven countries it finds as being deadly and discriminatory for LGBT people.\n\nMejia, 23, told reporters in Tijuana that the LGBT members of the caravan gravitated toward one another in search of support. For his part, Mejia was easy to find in the crowd. When ABC News spoke to him last month in the tiny town of Huixtla, Mexico, he was wearing a rainbow flag around his shoulders.\n\nRobert Zepeda/ABC News\n\n\"At first I was afraid to wear the flag. I didn\u2019t know how people would react,\" Mejia told ABC News in Spanish. \"In Guatemala, people were asking me what country the flag was and I told them it was the flag of the world.\"\n\nBut in his hometown of San Pedro Sula, Honduras, it was not viewed that way, he said.\n\n\"I was discriminated and beat up so it was time to go,\" Mejia explained.\n\nHe chose to join the caravan of thousands of other people, the majority of whom were also from Honduras, making their way to the U.S. border in the hopes of a better life.\n\nMejia said if he is able to make it to the border, he could make the case for political asylum.\n\n\"If I had the opportunity to make it to the border, I could show my representation of the community and ask for asylum, because [in the U.S.], there is a lot less discrimination than Honduras,\" he said.\n\nUnable to speak out\n\nRaul Valdivia, a gay man and human rights activist who still lives in Honduras, said he understands that discrimination firsthand.\n\n\"I've suffered many instances of discrimination based on my sexual orientation, but I remember the most violent came from state forces,\" Valdivia told ABC News. \"I was abused by police while on one of my very first dates. They took me and the other guy to a dark secluded area in a park and forced us to simulate sex. They also beat us with a belt. These are police who patrol downtown Tegucigalpa and I have seen them after, but I'm unable to speak out for fear of repercussions.\"\n\nValdivia said LGBT people in his country face \"assassinations, political attacks, legal discrimination and targeted street violence.\"\n\nThe country also has one of the highest homicide rates in the world outside of a war zone, according to the Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC). Authorities sometimes use gang violence as a cover for political and gender-based violence.\n\nNearly two thirds of Hondurans live in poverty, according to the World Bank. Corruption is a major issue, prompting the government to establish the Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH) in 2016 through an agreement with the Organization of American States, but much remains to be done.\n\n\"Marred by corruption and abuse, the judiciary and police remain largely ineffective. Impunity for crime and human rights abuses is the norm,\" a 2018 Human Rights Watch report found.\n\nThose who choose to speak out face harsh reprisals. In 2016, U.N. experts called it \"one of the most hostile and dangerous countries for human rights defenders.\" Human rights defenders routinely \"suffer threats, attacks, and killings,\" Human Rights Watch found.\n\nNo change at the ballot box\n\nIn November 2017, the country held a presidential election with widespread reports of fraud and violence. Thousands took to the streets to protest the re-election of Juan Orlando Hernandez, who changed the constitution to allow himself to run again.\n\nFernando Antonio/AP, FILE\n\nThe government's \"response to the post-electoral protests led to serious human rights violations,\" according to the U.N., and dozens were killed and more than 1,000 were arrested.\n\nUnable to change their country at the ballot box, many Hondurans chose to flee. And experts say that although the size of this caravan has grabbed headlines, many more Hondurans quietly flee the country every year, leaving conditions that have dramatically worsened since the 2009 military coup, especially for LGBTQ people, journalists and human rights activists.\n\nIn 2009, gay human rights activist Walter Trochez, 25, was killed in Tegucigalpa after trying to draw attention to anti-LGBT violence by security forces.\n\nIn July 2017, David Valle, project coordinator of the Center for LGBTI Cooperation and Development, was stabbed in his home after receiving threats, Human Rights Watch reported. He survived the attack, but it highlighted the deadly violence LGBT people face in the country.\n\nJorge Cabrera/Reuters, FILE\n\nIt is this environment that has prompted Hondurans to risk their lives on the journey north, both in caravans and on their own, experts say.\n\n\"As impressive in size as this caravan may be, it still represents a minute proportion of Central Americans -- today primarily Hondurans -- that are fleeing their communities,\" Alex Main, the director of international policy at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told ABC News.\n\nPolicies spurring an exodus north\n\nBut LGBT migrants and asylum seekers face dangers along the way, the Amnesty International report found, and often face discrimination and neglect in detention facilities as well. In May, Roxana Hernandez, a 33-year-old trans woman from Honduras, died while in ICE custody in New Mexico, the Associated Press reported.\n\nActivists said she had traveled in a migrant caravan to the U.S. border. Hernandez had been admitted to the hospital after showing symptoms of pneumonia, dehydration and complications associated with HIV, the AP reported.\n\nOrlando Sierra/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut even facing extreme dangers along the way and an uncertain future in a country whose president says it does not want them, people have continued to flee Honduras. That will continue until there are real policy changes, Main said.\n\n\"This mass exodus will only abate when the rampant violence in Hondurans abates, and when real economic development begins to take hold. This will require a profound revision of current economic models promoted by the U.S. and multilateral financial institutions and the displacement of a corrupt economic elite that retains power through repression and electoral shenanigans,\" Main added.\n\nEduardo Verdugo/AP, FILE\n\nUntil then, migrants, including those in the LGBT community, will continue to trek to the U.S., as this recent caravan has.\n\nMore than 2,600 migrants made it Tijuana Saturday, according to the Associated Press.\n\nMejia said he hopes his group's early arrival will give them an advantage with border officials.\n\n\"We wanted to avoid what always happens, which is that if we arrive last, the LGBT community is always the last to be taken into account in everything,\" he said at a press conference Sunday. \"So what we wanted to do is change that, and to be among the first, God willing, and request asylum.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Clothing retailer J.Crew's chief executive stepping down", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Is it the people in charge? Are our machines not like other states' machines? Fraud? Incompetence? It's hard to say.\"\n\nWith races for U.S. Senate and governor still officially undecided, the state's latest recount only adds to its reputation for bungling elections. To much of the world, vote-counting confusion is as authentically Florida as jam-packed theme parks, alligators on golf courses and the ubiquity of Pitbull (the Miami rapper, not the dog).\n\nFlorida's history of election woes dates back to 2000, when it took more than five weeks for the state to declare George W. Bush the victor over Vice President Al Gore by 537 votes, thus giving Bush the presidency. Back then, punch-card ballots were punch lines. Photos of election workers using magnifying glasses to search for hanging chads and pregnant chads symbolized the painstaking process.\n\nThere are no chads this year, but there are plenty of cracks about flashbacks to the Bush-Gore contest. And, just as in 2000, the Republican candidates in the contested races have declared themselves winners and asked for the recount to stop.\n\nAdd to this a litany of other voting problems: Palm Beach County's tallying machines went on the fritz during the recount due to age and overwork. The electricity went out in Hillsborough County during a machine recount and resulted in an 846-vote deficit. Broward County missed the state deadline to turn in recount results by two minutes.\n\nThose glitches led U.S. District Judge Mark Walker to ask why state officials have repeatedly failed to anticipate problems in elections.\n\n\"We have been the laughingstock of the world, election after election, and we chose not to fix this,\" he said. Walker is presiding over several election-related lawsuits that have been filed since Nov. 6.\n\nOn Friday, election workers in all 67 counties began recounting by hand about 93,000 ballots that were not recorded by voting machines. Many counties finished up the Senate recount on the first day. All results are supposed to be turned in by Sunday at noon. State officials will officially certify the totals next week.\n\nThe entire spectacle drew late-night TV jokes. Ally Hoard, Broward county native and writer on \"Late Night With Seth Myers,\" was merciless in a video clip.\n\n\"How will Florida handle this recount? Not great,\" she said. \"Florida is a mess. The people are confused and the system is corrupt.\"\n\nBut some others, like 74-year-old Dunedin resident Mary Sanders, said the \"laughingstock\" comment, and all the jokes, are unwarranted.\n\n\"I don't think that now that I live here,\" the New Jersey transplant said. \"I guess I'm becoming more pro-Florida.\"\n\nSanders, a volunteer with the League of Women Voters, spent Thursday in a windowless room at the Pinellas County election supervisor's office with dozens of other observers, watching officials scrutinize ballots. She said the world doesn't see the normal side of Florida during times such as this.\n\n\"Here in Pinellas County at least, it's been a very well-run election,\" she said.

The city opened the complex after other shelters were filled to capacity. Church groups provided portable showers, bathrooms and sinks. The federal government estimates the migrant crowd in Tijuana could soon swell to 10,000.\n\nTijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum has called the migrants' arrival an \"avalanche\" that the city is ill-prepared to handle, calculating that they will be in Tijuana for at least six months as they wait to file asylum claims. U.S. border inspectors are processing only about 100 asylum claims a day at Tijuana's main crossing to San Diego. Asylum seekers register their names in a tattered notebook managed by migrants themselves that had more than 3,000 names even before the caravan arrived.\n\nWhile many in Tijuana are sympathetic to the migrants' plight and trying to assist, some locals have shouted insults, hurled rocks and even thrown punches at the migrants.\n\nIt's a stark contrast to the many Mexican communities that welcomed the caravan with signs, music and donations of clothing after it entered Mexico nearly a month ago. Countless residents of rural areas pressed fruit and bags of water into the migrants' hands as they passed through southern Mexico, wishing them safe journeys.\n\nAlden Rivera, the Honduran ambassador in Mexico, visited the outdoor sports complex Saturday. Rivera expects the migrants will need to be sheltered for eight months or more, and said he is working with Mexico to get more funds to feed and care for them. He expects the migrant numbers in Tijuana to reach 3,400 over the weekend, with another 1,200 migrants having made it to Mexicali, another border city a few hours to the east of Tijuana. An additional 1,500 migrants plan to reach the U.S. border region next week.\n\nRivera said 1,800 Hondurans have returned to their country since the caravan first set out on Oct. 13, and that he hopes more will make that decision.\n\n\"We want them to return to Honduras,\" Rivera said, adding that each migrant must weigh whether to go home, appeal for asylum in Mexico or wait in line to apply for asylum in the U.S.\n\nThe Mexican Interior Ministry said Friday that 2,697 Central American migrants have requested asylum in Mexico under a program that the country launched on Oct. 26 to more quickly get them credentials needed to live, work and study in southern Mexico.\n\nIvis Mu\u00f1oz, 26, has considered returning to Honduras. The coffee farmer called his father in Atima, Honduras, on Saturday to consult on his next move a few days after being attacked on a beach by locals in Tijuana. His father told him to stick it out.\n\nMunoz has a bullet in his leg. A gang member shot him a year ago in Honduras and threatened to kill him if he sees him again. Munoz said he found out later his girlfriend had been cheating on him with the gang member.\n\nHe's afraid to go home, but he feels unwelcome in Tijuana.\n\nMunoz was asleep on a beach in Tijuana with about two dozen other migrants when rocks came raining down on them around 2 a.m. Wednesday. He heard a man shout in the darkness: \"We don't want you here! Go back to your country!\" Munoz and the others got up and ran for cover, heading toward the residential streets nearby. As the sun rose, they hitched a ride on a passing truck to Tijuana's downtown. Now he is staying at the sports complex.\n\n\"I don't know what to do,\" said Munoz. He fears the U.S. won't grant him asylum, and that he'll get deported if he tries to cross into the country without authorization.\n\nCarlos Padilla, 57, a migrant from Progreso, Honduras, said a Tijuana resident shouted \"migrants are pigs\" as he passed on the street recently. He did not respond. \"We didn't come here to cause problems, we came here with love and with the intention to ask for asylum,\" Padilla said. \"But they treat us like animals here.\"\n\nPadilla said he will likely return to Honduras if the U.S. rejects his asylum request.\n\nThe migrants' expected long stay in Tijuana has raised concerns about the ability of the border city of more than 1.6 million to handle the influx.\n\nTijuana officials said they converted the municipal gymnasium and recreational complex into a shelter to keep migrants out of public spaces. The city's privately run shelters have a maximum capacity of 700. The municipal complex can hold up to 3,000; as of Friday night there were 2,397 migrants there.\n\nSome business owners near the shelter complained on Saturday of migrants panhandling and stealing.\n\nFrancisco Lopez, 50, owns a furniture store nearby. He said a group of migrants took food from a small grocery a few doors down, and he worries that crime in the area will rise the longer the migrants stay at the shelter.\n\nOther neighbors expressed empathy.\n\n\"These poor people have left their country and they're in an unfamiliar place,\" said Maria de Jesus Izarraga, 68, who lives two blocks from complex.\n\nAs Izarraga spoke from her home's front door, a man interrupted to ask for money to buy a plate of beans. He said he came with the caravan and had blisters on his feet. She gave him some pesos, and continued speaking: \"I hope this all works out in the best possible way.\"\n\nOutside the complex, lines of migrants snaked along the street to receive donations of clothes and coolers full of bottled water being dropped off by charity groups and others looking to help the migrants.\n\nFelipe Garza, 55, acknowledged that many in his hometown don't want to help as he and other volunteers from his church handed migrants coffee and rolls at the impromptu municipal shelter. \"It's uncomfortable to receive such a big multitude of people, but it's a reality that we have to deal with,\" he said.\n\nGarza surmised that if the Central Americans behave, Tijuana will embrace them just as it did thousands of Haitians in 2016. Those Haitians have since opened restaurants, hair salons and enrolled in local universities.\n\nPolice officer Victor Coronel agrees but wonders how much more the city can take. \"The only thing we can do is hope that President (Donald) Trump opens his heart a little,\" said Coronel.\n\nTrump, who sought to make the caravan a campaign issue in last week's elections, took to Twitter on Friday to aim new criticism at the migrants.\n\n\"Isn't it ironic that large Caravans of people are marching to our border wanting U.S.A. asylum because they are fearful of being in their country \u2014 yet they are proudly waving ... their country's flag.

There are numerous details to work out, though those are expected to be finalized in the coming days.\n\nMiles would take over for David Beaty, who was fired two weeks ago. Beaty agreed to finish out his fourth season, and is 6-30 heading into Saturday night's game at sixth-ranked Oklahoma.\n\nMiles has long been considered the front-runner for the job because of his close relationship with new Kansas athletic director Jeff Long. The two worked together at Michigan and stayed in touch over the years. Long tried to hire Miles when he was the AD at Arkansas.\n\nSports Illustrated first reported Friday that Long and Miles were in negotiations.\n\nMiles, who turned 65 last week, turned around Oklahoma State over the course of four years before leaving for LSU, where he inherited Nick Saban's powerhouse. He won a national title three years later, then lost to Saban and Alabama in the national championship game following the 2011 season.\n\nBut Tiger fans began to grow frustrated with Miles' reluctance to adapt to the air-it-out offenses that began to sweep through college football. And despite reaching a bowl game every season during his tenure in Baton Rouge, he was let go after a 2-2 start to the 2016 season.\n\nAnything close to that level of success would be welcome at Kansas.\n\nThe Jayhawks haven't had a winning season or reached a bowl game since 2008, their penultimate season under Mark Mangino. After he was forced out, the school churned through Turner Gill and Charlie Weis before hiring Beaty, a nondescript assistant with ties to the program.\n\nBeaty did well in restoring scholarship numbers and generating fan interest, fixing many of the problems created by Gill's and Weis's failed tenures. He landed better prospects, including several from Louisiana that will no doubt be familiar with Miles, and brought an unceasing energy that served him well as he tried to turn around the Jayhawks' moribund program.\n\nThe only thing missing was the wins. Beaty has beaten just two Big 12 opponents, both of them at home, and his inability to get the Jayhawks close to a bowl game led to his ouster.\n\nNow, it appears Miles is close to getting the next shot.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP\u2014Top25"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "C.

We need leaders, not dividers, and her words show that she lacks the understanding and judgment to represent the people of our state.\"\n\nFour days later, another video of Hyde-Smith, from Nov. 3, was posted on Twitter.

Instead, her campaign spokesperson released a statement Thursday that said, \"Obviously Sen. Hyde-Smith was making a joke and clearly the video was selectively edited.\"\n\nSince her comments emerged and put her candidacy on edge, Hyde-Smith reversed course from the immediate days after Nov. 6, and is now ratcheting up her rhetoric and turning negative in this tight contest.\n\nIn that same statement from Thursday, the Hyde-Smith campaign deflected from her own controversy by calling out Espy for allegedly lying about a lobbying contract with the Ivory Coast government during a period of violent upheaval.\n\n\"Now the liberal media wants to talk about anything other than Mike Espy's record of corruption and taking $750,000 -- and lying about it -- from an African dictator now charged with war crimes, including murder, rape and torture,\u201d Melissa Scallan, spokeswoman for the Hyde-Smith campaign, said.\n\nA new digital ad from Hyde-Smith's campaign, released Friday, touts the alleged connection between Espy and the African despot who refused to give up power in the Ivory Coast and is now on trial for crimes against humanity.\n\nThe statement and the ad are based on a Fox News report, released Thursday, that published a U.S. Department of Justice Foreign Agents Registration Act document that shows that Espy continued to receive payments as part of a lobbying contract with the Ivory Coast's former president.\n\nRogelio V. Solis/AP, FILE\n\nEspy\u2019s agricultural consulting firm, AE Agritrade Inc., signed a three-month contract with the Cocoa and the Coffee Board of the Ivory Coast for $750,000, according to the document. Espy was an agricultural consulting agent after he served as agriculture secretary under President Bill Clinton.\n\nBut the former congressman told the Hill in 2011 that he halted the contract during the violent conflict that erupted after then-President Laurent Gbagbo refused to relinquish power after losing in an election to Alassane Ouattara.\n\nEspy said he \"only worked on the contract for a little more than a month before suspending it in early February.\"\n\n\"I have voluntarily suspended it,\" he told the Hill in 2011. \"Events are spiraling rapidly. It is very difficult to work in that context.\"\n\nThe FARA document published by Fox News shows that Espy's Jackson-based consulting firm was paid the full $750,000, and the payments continued through March 1, 2011. His consulting firm received a payment of $400,000 from the Ivory Coast's Cocoa and Coffee Board in January 2011, and then $350,000 on March 1, 2011.\n\n\"Secretary Espy worked on agricultural issues for international clients. Over the course of that work, he realized one of those clients didn't pass the smell test, so he terminated the contract, and then reported what he knew to the U.S. government,\" Danny Blanton, communications director for Espy's campaign, said in a statement first to Fox News and confirmed by ABC News.\n\nEspy has run into ethical scandals in the past, during his tenure as a member of Clinton's cabinet, his rising political stardom in the 1990s was halted by a corruption scandal involving personal gifts from food companies he regulated in the Clinton administration. He was acquitted of all those charges.\n\nBut the underdog\u2019s campaign is also not shying away from the bitter rivalry, after a spokesperson Espy fired back in two statements, first addressing the most recent Hyde-Smith video about voter suppression.\n\n\"For a state like Mississippi, where voting rights were obtained through sweat and blood, everyone should appreciate that this is not a laughing matter,\" Blanton said. \"Mississippians deserve a senator who represents our best qualities, not a walking stereotype who embarrasses our state.\"\n\nIn another statement, Blanton chastised Hyde-Smith for the \"smear campaign\" against the former agriculture secretary.\n\n\"Cindy Hyde-Smith had a chance to admit she was wrong, and instead of apologizing, she doubled down. Since that hasn't worked, she's trying to change the subject with a smear campaign against Mike,\" he said.\n\nBut in a state that President Donald Trump won by nearly 20 percentage points, support for Hyde-Smith among her Republican base is unsurprisingly unwavering. The president is heading to the state for two rallies in Tupelo and Biloxi later this month on Nov. 26. She's even scoring steady fundraising numbers after making the \"public hanging\" remark.\n\nTom Williams/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images\n\nHyde-Smith reported 17 new contributions totaling $65,700, including $5,000 from Google's PAC, on Tuesday, shortly after the controversy erupted, according to Open Secrets.\n\nGoogle's contribution is the PAC's first to Hyde-Smith\u2019s campaign, but the company told Open Secrets it was made before her controversial remark.\n\n\"This contribution was made on November 2nd before Senator Hyde-Smith\u2019s remarks became public on November 11th,\" a Google spokesperson told Open Secrets. \"While we support candidates who promote pro-growth policies for business and technology, we do not condone these remarks and would not have made such a contribution had we known about them.\"\n\nFor his part, Espy has raised over $163,000 in new contributions as of Nov. 13, according to his latest FEC filing. He is also counting on support from national Democrats including potential 2020 contenders, African-American Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, who have planned visits on Saturday and Monday, according to the campaign, to shore up support and vault him to the U.S. Senate.\n\nControversies may be abound in this runoff election, but with less than two weeks until voters head back to the polls, it appears that for whoever emerges victorious, the battle to get there is already turning ugly."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": null, "title": "Controversies hamper candidates in Mississippi Senate race - ABC News", "description": "ABC News Controversies hamper candidates in Mississippi Senate race ABC News In the past week, a special election contest in Mississippi that seemed to be flying under the radar was in disarray as the two candidates jockeying for the state's open Senate seat \u2026", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/controversies-hamper-candidates-mississippi-senate-race/story?id%3D59256622", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T18:22:22Z", "content": null, "fulltext": "bad url"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Jordyn Phelps and Anthony Rivas", "title": "Trump receives CIA update on Khashoggi case, as reports tie Saudi prince to killing", "description": "President Trump was briefed on the killing of the Washington Post columnist.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/president-trump-receives-cia-briefing-jamal-khashoggi-murder/story?id=59265282", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/trump1-gty-ml-181117_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T18:07:55Z", "content": "President Donald Trump was briefed Saturday on the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a day after multiple reports linked the murder to Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Instead, Noorvik is accessible mostly by plane and boat, on the Kobuk River, with snowmobiles and ATVs a common mode of transportation for locals.\n\nDunleavy said in a statement that he and his wife chose Noorvik out of respect for her family and because of fond memories of the years they spent in rural Alaska. The couple, who have three daughters, lived in the regional hub town of Kotzebue for 13 years before the family eventually settled on 45 acres near Wasilla, north of Anchorage.\n\n\"For us, it is the right thing to do \u2014 to call attention to the beauty, warmth and spirit of a part of our state many Alaskans have not experienced,\" wrote Dunleavy, a former educator and state senator.\n\nAlaska is the only U.S. state with areas above the Arctic Circle, and historians and others knew of no other governors sworn in to office in the region known for its icy waters and extreme conditions. U.S. Rep. Don Young has a home in Fort Yukon, above the Arctic Circle.\n\nMost of Alaska's previous governors took their oaths in Juneau, though former Gov. Sarah Palin, the 2008 vice presidential nominee, and her successor Sean Parnell, had their ceremonies in the interior town of Fairbanks.\n\nThis isn't the first time Noorvik has been in the limelight. It was the first community counted in the 2010 census.\n\nNoorvik voted overwhelmingly for Dunleavy in his race against Democrat Mark Begich.\n\nWord of Dunleavy's swearing-in is spreading quickly, and people from surrounding villages are planning to attend, according to Noorvik Mayor Vern Cleveland.\n\n\"Oh, man.

Newlin said his sister called him to tell him about the upcoming ceremony. The event will be held in the gym of the village school, named after their late father, Robert Newlin Sr., an Inupiat leader and one of the founders of the NANA Corp., the regional Native corporation.\n\nGordon Newlin is a maintenance worker at the school, where he says people are excited because of his brother-in-law's years with the Northwest Arctic Borough School District. He also hasn't seen his sister for at least a year, so her visit will be a bit of a reunion.\n\n\"It felt great when they selected Noorvik as the place to be,\" he said.\n\nDunleavy representatives and Cleveland, the mayor, said the ceremony is still in the planning stages.\n\nBut one idea Cleveland likes is the possibility of locals using sled dog teams to pick up visitors from the Noorvik airport, as they did in 2010 when census officials and others began counting the nation's residents there. At the time, residents also hosted a day of festivities with traditional dances, an Inupiat fashion show and a feast of caribou soup, baked bearded seal and other subsistence foods.\n\nMultiple entities will take part in the upcoming celebration, including NANA, city, tribal and borough representatives, according to Cleveland. \"The whole shebang.

She accused Kemp of using his office secretary of state's office to aggressively purge the rolls of inactive voters, enforce an \"exact match\" policy for checking voters' identities that left thousands of registrations in limbo, and enact other policies to tilt the outcome in his favor.\n\nKemp, who stepped down as secretary of state when he declared victory that day after Election Day, defended the outcome of the race.\n\n\"Look, we have laws on the books that prevent elections from being stolen from anyone,\" Kemp said, insisting those laws \"make sure we have secure, accessible, fair elections.\"\n\nThe speech Abrams delivered at her campaign headquarters Friday evening marked the close of the 44-year-old attorney and former lawmaker's unsuccessful attempt to make history as America's first black woman governor. Since Election Day her campaign fought on, insisting efforts to suppress turnout had left thousands of ballots uncounted that otherwise could erode Kemp's lead and force a runoff election.\n\n\"Let's be clear: This is not a speech of concession,\" Abrams said. \"Because concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true or proper. As a woman of conscience and faith, I cannot concede that.\"\n\nKemp, the 55-year-old businessman who oversaw the election as Georgia's secretary of state, will keep the governor's office in GOP hands as the state's third Republican governor since Reconstruction.\n\nThe race grabbed the attention of the nation, with Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey campaigning for Abrams in the final days and President Donald Trump holding a rally for Kemp.\n\nUnofficial returns showed Kemp ahead by roughly 60,000 votes out of nearly 4 million cast on Nov. 6. Kemp declared himself governor-elect the next day and stepped down as Georgia's secretary of state, though thousands of absentee and provisional ballots remained uncounted.\n\nAbrams, meanwhile, sent volunteers across the state in search of voters whose ballots were rejected. She filed suit in federal court to force county elections boards to count absentee ballots with incorrect birthdates. Her campaign even planned for possible litigation to challenge the election's certified outcome.\n\nAbrams didn't take that route. She said she had concluded \"the law currently allows no further viable remedy.\" Instead, she said she would fight to restore integrity to Georgia's election system in a new initiative called Fair Fight Georgia.\n\n\"In the coming days, we will be filing a major federal lawsuit against the state of Georgia for the gross mismanagement of this election and to protect future elections from unconstitutional actions,\" Abrams said, though she gave no details.\n\nKemp had been secretary of state since 2010. He was backed by and had embraced Trump as he tried to maintain GOP dominance in a state that hasn't elected a Democrat to the governor's mansion since 1998.\n\nTrump praised the Democrat in lauding Kemp's victory, tweeting: \"Congratulations to Brian Kemp on becoming the new Governor of Georgia. Stacey Abrams fought brilliantly and hard -- she will have a terrific political future! Brian was unrelenting and will become a great Governor for the truly Wonderful People of Georgia!\"\n\nKemp stormed to the GOP nomination with ads featuring everything from the candidate cranking a chain saw and jokingly pointing a gun toward a teen male suitor of his daughter, to Kemp's offer to \"round up criminal illegals\" himself in his pickup truck. He's promised a tax cut and teacher pay raises and pledged to continue Georgia's refusal to expand Medicaid insurance under President Barack Obama's 2010 health care overhaul.\n\nAbrams' campaign sparked huge energy across the state and she became a national Democratic star. Election turnout among both sides' energized bases nearly equaled that of the 2016 presidential vote.\n\nAides close to Abrams said that since the election she had been wrestling with competing priorities: She wanted to advance her assertions that Georgia's elections process \u2014 which Kemp managed as secretary of state \u2014 makes it too hard for some citizens to vote. But she also recognized that a protracted legal fight would harm that cause and potentially her political future.\n\nKemp's victory is an important marker for Republicans ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Kemp's narrow margin already suggests that Georgia, a state Trump won by 5 percentage points in 2016, could be a genuine battleground in two years. Trump bet big on Kemp, endorsing him ahead of Kemp's Republican primary runoff and campaigning for him the weekend prior to the Nov. 6 election. Now, Trump will be able to return with an incumbent governor as he seeks a second term.\n\nAbrams' political future is less certain. She made believers of old-guard Democrats in Georgia who didn't think a black woman could compete in a general election, and she emerged as the party's clear leader.\n\nBut the party also has plenty of other ambitious politicians who will want to take advantage of the path that Abrams' has charted. The next big shot for Democrats is a 2020 Senate race, with Republican Sen. David Perdue making his first re-election attempt.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Kate Brumback also contributed from Atlanta.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Barrow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP and Brumback at https://twitter.com/katebrumback."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Amazon's would-be NY neighbors: Cynicism, some hope for jobs", "description": "Residents of the housing project near the Queens location where Amazon would make its New York City home have mixed reactions to the global behemoth coming to the neighborhood", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/amazons-ny-neighbors-cynicism-hope-jobs-59265281", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/WireAP_cfde3571887d49edbafbfd98a5aaf741_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T16:49:08Z", "content": "Shawn Smith has heard the promises before.

When new hotels sprang up near the public housing complex in Queens where he's lived for 17 years, residents were told they would bring jobs and economic opportunity.\n\nHe hasn't seen any of it. So he's cynical about the announcement this week that Amazon will build a headquarters for 25,000 workers on the Long Island City waterfront, a half mile from his home. Elected officials gleefully promised that Amazon's presence will buoy all of western Queens. Smith is not so sure.\n\n\"The hotels here, they're not hiring nobody. They're bringing their own kind,\" said Smith, who commutes to a construction job in New Jersey. \"That's how I feel about Amazon.\"\n\nHis wasn't the only skeptical voice among the roughly 6,400 residents of the Queensbridge Houses, the largest public housing complex in the U.S.\n\nResidents, most of whom are black or Hispanic, expressed hope that there might be something for them in Amazon's hiring bonanza to offset the pressures of neighborhood gentrification. But they are taking the promised opportunity with a grain of salt.\n\n\"Let's see if they hire from around here,\" said Fontaine White, 54, who has lived in Queensbridge for eight years. \"I think it's a good idea, provided you remember we live here, too. If you put Amazon in Long Island City, we're part of Long Island City.\"\n\nCity and state officials promised at least $2.8 billion in tax credits and grants to lure Amazon to Queens, where it would occupy a new campus built around a formerly industrial boat basin.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, both Democrats, have heralded the deal as good for everyone.\n\nDe Blasio, who won office on promises to address the widening gap between rich and poor in the city, said Amazon has pledged to give money for job training programs for public housing residents, provide space for a new school and pay into a city fund that will be used for projects that benefit the community.\n\n\"When you add that kind of number (of jobs) into our economy, you're opening a lot of opportunity for everyday people,\" de Blasio said Friday during his weekly appearance on the Brian Lehrer Show on WNYC radio. He said Amazon's presence would lead to \"a lot of jobs for young people coming out of our public schools, coming out of public housing, coming out of city universities. And that's crucial to addressing inequality.\"\n\nThe big government incentives for Amazon have sharply split the Democrats who dominate state politics.\n\nU.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer issued a statement in support of the deal. The state's junior Senator, Kirsten Gillibrand, tweeted that \"one of the wealthiest companies in history should not be receiving financial assistance from the taxpayers while too many New York families struggle to make ends meet.\"\n\nThe city councilman and state senator representing Long Island City are exploring ways to try to block the subsidies. About 100 people attended a protest of the deal this week.\n\nNew Yorkers who ride the subway through Queens have wondered how the neighborhood will handle additional commuters. The station closest to where Amazon would be located already has an average daily ridership of 23,672, making it among the system's busiest.\n\nQueensbridge Houses has also factored heavily in the public discussion.\n\nFor decades, the 26-building housing project in the shadow of the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge was known for being a rough place. It factored big in Hip Hop history, producing talents including Marley Marl, Roxanne Shante, Nas, and Havoc of the rap duo Mobb Deep.\n\nCrime has abated substantially in recent years. Queensbridge was celebrated for going nearly two years without a shooting before the streak ended in 2017. But like most New York City housing projects, residents complain of poor conditions, unreliable heat and hot water, and rats and roaches.\n\nThe same week officials celebrated their willingness to let Amazon avoid billions of dollars in taxes, a federal judge rejected a consent decree that would have had the city pay $1 billion over four years and an additional $200 million annually for the following six years to fix deplorable conditions in public housing, saying it didn't go far enough.\n\nThere are \"a lot of issues with housing not fixing things, not doing things,\" said Lisa Cruz, 40, an office manager who has lived in Queensbridge for 12 years. \"It's really bad.\"\n\nThe area around Queensbridge has already been changing fast. Luxury condominiums have sprouted. JetBlue's corporate headquarters is a modest walk away. An artisanal brewery moved in. Hotels, once rare in outer boroughs, have sprouted, taking advantage of safe streets and quick access to Manhattan. A big waterfront park was spruced up.\n\n\"The neighborhood is a lot cleaner than it was. There's been a lot more changes. A lot more police officers around,\" said Cruz, a mother of four.\n\nBut prices have gone up in local grocery stores and increased congestion has made parking difficult.\n\n\"It's unfortunate that it has to take for new hotels to come in, and new buildings and new storage units for fancy-schmancy stuff,\" Cruz said. \"The park has changed so much. That's something we enjoy, but how many years did it take for them to fix Queensbridge Park for us in the community to enjoy it?\"\n\nAshley Nieves, who has lived her entire 21 years in Queensbridge, was concerned that Amazon's arrival would make the neighborhood more expensive, but was hopeful it would lead to job opportunities.\n\nThat would be a trade-off she was willing to live with.\n\n\"If you hire more people, especially people who live in the projects,\" the mother of two said, \"it's kind of like opening doors to live better.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDeepti Hajela covers issues of race, ethnicity and immigration for The Associated Press.

Bush in 2001. Democratic President Barack Obama kept him in the job, and Mueller left in September 2013 after six years under Obama. Mueller is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and relationships between Russian figures and Trump campaign operatives.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNATO\n\nTRUMP: \"Emmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia. But it was Germany in World Wars One & Two - How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along. Pay for NATO or not!\" \u2014 tweet on Tuesday.\n\nTRUMP: \"President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\" \u2014 tweet on Nov. 9.\n\nTHE FACTS: Macron never suggested assembling a European army to stand against the United States, its steadfast military ally. Instead, he joined German Chancellor Angela Merkel in proposing a continental army that would give Europe more responsibility for its own security, supplementing NATO. Trump has repeatedly pushed NATO members to spend more on their own military capabilities to relieve pressure on the U.S. to protect Europe. A European army would be aimed at doing that, though in theory outside the NATO umbrella.\n\nMacron said in a radio interview before Trump's arrival in France that Europe should be able to defend itself more than it now can, without only relying on the United States.\n\nAt another point in the interview, Macron discussed hacking and other cyberthreats and asserted that on that front, France must protect itself from China, Russia and even the United States. His concern about U.S. hackers had nothing to do with military threats or forces.\n\nTrump misrepresented Macron's position on the matter before they met and again after they discussed it.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWHITE HOUSE\n\nSARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, on a judge's order that CNN reporter Jim Acosta be allowed back into the White House: \"Today, the court made clear that there is no absolute First Amendment right to access the White House.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: The court made no such determination. U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly issued a ruling of a \"limited nature\" that restored Acosta's credentials temporarily while a CNN lawsuit against the Trump administration proceeds. Kelly essentially found support for CNN's claim under the Fifth Amendment that Acosta hadn't received sufficient notice or explanation before his credentials were pulled. As a result, the judge didn't get to the First Amendment issues in the case.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTRADE\n\nTRUMP: \"On Trade, France makes excellent wine, but so does the U.S. The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France, and charges big Tariffs, whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines, and charges very small Tariffs. Not fair, must change!\" \u2014 tweet on Tuesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Yes, U.S. wine is desired in France.\n\nTrump, who's been in the wine business, is wrong about France applying tariffs. The European Union does.\n\nHe's right about a disparity in wine duties.\n\nTariffs vary by alcohol content and other factors. A bottle of white American wine with 13 percent alcohol content imported into the EU carries a customs duty of 10 euro cents (just over 11 U.S. cents). A bottle of white wine from the EU exported to the United States has a customs duty of 5 U.S. cents.\n\nThe gap in duties is narrower for red wine with an alcohol content of 14.5 percent.\n\nBulk wines are another story. The U.S. tariff is double the EU one, a break for American producers because bulk wine represents 25 percent of the volume of U.S. wine coming into the EU, according to the French wine exporter federation.\n\nThe value of wine imported by France has jumped 200 percent over a decade. Meantime Americans are the top consumers of French wine exports.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nVOTER ID\n\nTRUMP: \"The disgrace is that, voter ID. If you buy, you know, a box of cereal, if you do anything, you have a voter ID ...The only thing you don't is if you're a voter of the United States.\" \u2014 interview on Wednesday with The Daily Caller.\n\nTHE FACTS: He is meaning to say that shoppers use a photo ID to make purchases, so it should not be a burden to show a photo ID for voting. But as shoppers know, no photo is required to purchase a box of cereal or other items at a grocery store when using cash or to make routine purchases with credit or debit cards.\n\nIdentifications are required to purchase limited items such as alcohol, cigarettes or cold medicine and in rapidly declining situations in which a customer opts to pay with a personal check.\n\nAccording to the National Grocers Association's most recent data, the use of checks as a percentage of total transactions dropped from 33 percent in 2000 to 6 percent in 2015, due in part to the popularity of debit cards, which use PIN codes. The group's members are independent food retailers, family-owned or privately held, both large and small.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nVETERANS\n\nTRUMP: \"In June, I proudly signed into law the most significant VA reform in half a century, called Veterans Choice. ... Now if a veteran cannot get the treatment they need from the VA in a timely manner, they can see a private doctor. They don't have to wait 12 days or 20 days. ... There is no more waiting on lines.\" \u2014 remarks on Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He continues to spread a misleading claim about veterans now receiving immediate medical care because of his improvements. In fact, the care provided under the Veterans Choice program is not as instantaneous as Trump suggests nor will it necessarily be the biggest overhaul at the Department of Veterans Affairs in decades.\n\nTrump signed legislation in June to expand the private-sector Choice program, which was first approved in 2014 during the Obama administration after a scandal at the Phoenix VA medical center in which some veterans died while waiting months for appointments. The current Choice program allows veterans to see doctors outside the VA system if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment \u2014 not \"12 days or 20 days.\" But many are waiting much longer than the program prescribes.\n\nHow much Choice will be expanded under his law will depend on yet-to-be-completed regulations that will determine eligibility for veterans as well as available money for the program. The VA has yet to resolve long-term financing due to congressional budget caps that could put money for VA or other domestic programs at risk of shortfalls next year.\n\nThe program's success will also depend on an overhaul of the VA's electronic medical records to allow seamless sharing of medical records with private physicians, expected to take up to 10 years.\n\nMeanwhile, the current Choice program isn't always timely. A report released this year by the Government Accountability Office found that despite the Choice program's guarantee of providing an appointment within 30 days, veterans waited an average of 51 days to 64 days.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTRUMP: \"Veteran unemployment has reached its lowest level in nearly 21 years, and it's going to be better.\" \u2014 remarks on Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: The veterans' unemployment rate fell to 2.9 percent in October, the latest data available, but that is still higher than the 2.7 percent rate reached in October 2017, also under Trump. That was the lowest joblessness rate for veterans in nearly 17 years.\n\nVeterans' unemployment has fallen mostly for the same reasons that joblessness has dropped generally: strong hiring and steady economic growth for the past eight years.\n\nIn May 2000, veterans' unemployment dropped to a low of 2.3 percent, and he hasn't reached that.\n\nIn any event, it's impossible for Trump to claim an achievement not seen in 21 years on veterans' unemployment. The data on joblessness for vets only go back 18 years, to 2000.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nCALIFORNIA WILDFIRES\n\nTRUMP: \"There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\" \u2014 tweet on Nov. 10.\n\nTHE FACTS: Both nature and humans share blame for California's devastating wildfires, but fire scientists say forest management is not a leading contributor.\n\nNature provides the dangerous winds that have whipped the fires, and human-caused climate change over the long haul is killing and drying the shrubs and trees that provide the fuel. That's not to say California is blameless: Urban development encroaching on wildlands also is a factor.\n\nThe wildfire that incinerated the Northern California town of Paradise and surrounding areas is the single deadliest such blaze in California history.\n\nThe other major fire, in Southern California, has burned through shrub land, not forest.\n\n\"It's not about forest management,\" said University of Utah fire scientist Philip Dennison. \"These aren't forests.\"\n\nThe dean of the University of Michigan's environmental school, Jonathan Overpeck, said Western fires are getting bigger and more severe. He said it \"is much less due to bad management and is instead the result of our baking of our forests, woodlands and grasslands with ever-worsening climate change.\"\n\nWildfires have become more devastating because of the extreme weather swings from global warming, fire scientists said. The average number of U.S. acres burned by wildfires has doubled from 30 years ago.\n\nCalifornia also has been in drought for all but a few years of the 21st century and is now experiencing its longest drought, which began on Dec. 27, 2011, and has lasted 358 weeks, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Nearly two-thirds of the state is abnormally dry.\n\nThe first nine months of the year have been fourth-warmest on record for California, and this past summer was the second-hottest on record in the state.\n\nBecause of that, there are 129 million dead trees, which provide fuel for fires.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Jessica Gresko, Darlene Superville, Christopher Rugaber and Seth Borenstein contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck\n\n.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "GOP seeks last-ditch laws in states where its power slipped", "description": "Braced for a new era of divided government, lame-duck Republicans who have long controlled two upper Midwest states are priming last-ditch laws to advance their conservative agenda or to weaken the influence of Democratic governors-elect", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/gop-seeks-ditch-laws-states-power-slipped-59264732", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/WireAP_11a4840eefa849868fd3d5839fadaad2_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T16:12:54Z", "content": "With their grip on power set to loosen come January, Republicans in several states are considering last-ditch laws that would weaken existing or incoming Democratic governors and advance their own conservative agendas.

Scott Walker. And in North Carolina, Republicans may try to hash out the requirements of a new voter ID constitutional amendment before they lose their legislative supermajorities and their ability to unilaterally override vetoes by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper.\n\nRepublicans downplay the tactics and point out that Democrats have also run lame-duck sessions, including in Wisconsin in 2010 before Walker took office and the GOP took control of the Legislature. But some of the steps Republicans are expected to take will almost surely be challenged in court, and critics say such maneuvers undermine the political system and the will of the people, who voted for change.\n\n\"It's something that smacks every Michigan voter in the face and tells them that this Republican Party doesn't care about their voice, their perspective,\" House Democratic Leader Sam Singh said of the strategizing to control the fate of minimum wage increases and paid sick leave requirements.\n\nThe moves would follow midterm elections in which Democrats swept statewide offices in Michigan and Wisconsin for the first time in decades but fell short of taking over their gerrymandered legislatures. That gives Republicans a final shot to lock in new policies, with Democrats unable to undo them anytime soon.\n\nMichigan's new minimum wage and sick time laws began as ballot drives but because they were preemptively adopted by lawmakers in September rather than by voters, they can be altered with simple majority votes rather than the support of three-fourths of both chambers.\n\nOne measure would gradually raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour and increase a lower wage for tipped workers until it is in line with the minimum. The other would require that employees qualify for between 40 and 72 hours of paid sick leave, depending on the size of their employer.\n\nIt is unclear how the laws may be changed to appease an anxious business lobby. The Michigan Chamber of Commerce says mandatory sick time \u2014 10 other states also require it \u2014 will place \"severe compliance burdens\" on employers, including those with paid leave policies in place currently. The group also is urging lawmakers to \"be pragmatic, not extreme\" and revisit the wage hikes that would make Michigan's minimum the highest in the Midwest.\n\nRepublicans seem unfazed by criticism that scaling back the measures would thwart the will of voters who resoundingly elected Democrat Gretchen Whitmer to replace GOP Gov. Rick Snyder, who reached his term limit. The Michigan Senate's majority leader, Arlan Meekhof, said changes to the laws are needed to \"continue to keep our economy on track and not put a roadblock or hindrance\" in the way of businesses.\n\nLame-duck sessions, which are commonplace in Congress but rare among many state legislatures, are frenetic, as legislators rush to consider bills that are controversial or were put on the backburner during election season. Michigan's 2012 session, for example, produced right-to-work laws and a contentious revised emergency manager statute for cities in financial peril, despite voters having just repealed the previous law.\n\nThe lame-duck period may be especially intense this year in Michigan and Wisconsin because they are among just four states in which Republicans are losing full control the governorship and both legislative chambers. Lawmakers in the other two states, Kansas and New Hampshire, will not convene until next year.\n\nSix states with a split government now will be fully controlled by Democrats in 2019, and Alaska will be fully controlled by Republicans.\n\nWisconsin Republicans plan to consider a variety of ways to protect laws enacted by Walker . Those include limiting Evers' ability to make appointments, restricting his authority over the rule-making process and making it more difficult for him to block a work requirement for Medicaid recipients. They might also change the date of the 2020 presidential primary so that a Walker-appointed state Supreme Court justice has better odds to win election.\n\nIn North Carolina, GOP legislators may use the session for more than approving additional bipartisan Hurricane Florence relief. They are expected to implement a voter photo ID requirement passed this month by the electorate and to consider other legislation that the Democratic governor would be powerless to stop until Republicans can no longer easily override his vetoes come 2019.\n\nTwo years ago, they reduced Cooper's powers before he took office. He successfully sued over a law that diminished his role in managing elections. Other suits remain pending.\n\nMichigan's outgoing governor, Snyder, hasn't weighed in on the plan to amend the minimum wage and sick leave laws, which would require his signature, unlike when they were passed. He is trying to persuade his fellow Republicans to boost and add new fees for environmental cleanup and water infrastructure upgrades, and he wants the Legislature to help facilitate a deal to drill an oil pipeline tunnel beneath the Straits of Mackinac. The agreement is opposed by Whitmer and the state's Democratic Attorney General-elect, Dana Nessel.\n\nSupporters of the existing wage and sick time laws have been mobilizing to keep them intact. MI Time to Care \u2014 the campaign backing guaranteed paid time off for workers who are sick or need to stay home with an ill family member \u2014 launched ads, mailed postcards and went door to door before the election reminding people of their rights under the law that is scheduled to take effect in March.\n\nChairwoman Danielle Atkinson said the sick leave proposal would have been approved in a \"landslide\" if it had been on the ballot.\n\n\"It's clearly why the Legislature moved to pass it, and now they should uphold it as the promise that they made to the voters,\" she said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Scott Bauer in Madison, Wis., and Gary Robertson in Raleigh, N.C., contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow David Eggert on Twitter at https://twitter.com/DavidEggert00 .

Add Interest\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Saturday that his administration will release a full report in the next two days about the death of a Saudi journalist, which has created a diplomatic conundrum for the president: How to admonish Riyadh for the killing yet maintain strong ties with a close ally in the Middle East.\n\n\"We'll be having a very full report over the next two days, probably Monday or Tuesday,\" Trump said. That will include \"who did it,\" he said.\n\nReporters asked Trump about the death of Jamal Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post who was slain Oct. 2 inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia's top diplomat has said the crown prince had \"absolutely\" nothing to do with it.\n\nAmerican intelligence agencies have concluded that the crown prince ordered the killing in the Saudi Consulate in Turkey, according to a U.S. official familiar with the assessment. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Others familiar with the case caution that while it's likely that the crown prince was involved in the death, there continue to be questions about what role he played.\n\n\"The United States government is determined to hold all those responsible for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi accountable,\" the State Department said in a statement. \"Recent reports indicating that the U.S. government has made a final conclusion are inaccurate. There remain numerous unanswered questions with respect to the murder of Mr. Khashoggi.\"\n\nThe statement added: \"The U.S. government has taken decisive measures against the individuals responsible, including visa and sanctions actions. We will continue to explore additional measures to hold those accountable who planned, led and were connected to the murder. And, we will do that while maintaining the important strategic relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nIntelligence officials have been providing information to Trump about the death for weeks and he was briefed again by phone Saturday by CIA Director Gina Haspel and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as he flew to California. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders provided no details of his call but said the president has confidence in the CIA.\n\nBefore his call on Air Force One, Trump told reporters that when it came to the crown prince, \"as of this moment we were told that he did not play a role. We're going to have to find out what they have to say.\" That echoed remarks by national security adviser John Bolton, who said earlier this week that people who have listened to an audio recording of the killing do not think it implicates the crown prince.\n\nAlso before leaving on his trip, Trump said Saudi Arabia was \"a truly spectacular ally in terms of jobs and economic development.\"\n\n\"I have to take a lot of things into consideration\" when deciding what measures to take against the kingdom, he said.\n\nTrump has called the killing a botched operation that was carried out very poorly and has said \"the cover-up was one of the worst cover-ups in the history of cover-ups.\"\n\nBut he has resisted calls to cut off arms sales to the kingdom and has been reluctant to antagonize the Saudi rulers. Trump considers the Saudis vital allies in his Mideast agenda.\n\nBut members of Congress are pushing Trump for a tougher response to the killing. The administration this past week penalized 17 Saudi officials for their alleged role in the killing, but American lawmakers have called on the administration to curtail arms sales to Saudi Arabia or take other harsher punitive measures.\n\nVice President Mike Pence told reporters traveling with him Saturday for a summit of Pacific Rim nations in Papua, New Guinea, that the \"murder of Jamal Khashoggi was an atrocity. It was also an affront to a free and independent press, and the United States is determined to hold all of those accountable who are responsible for that murder.\"\n\nKhashoggi, a Saudi who lived in the United States, often criticized the royal family.

When they can, the office arranges for the return of remains to family members back home.\n\nLucy Nicholson/Reuters\n\nTwo weeks earlier, Gomez and Paiz had set off from Aguacate, a struggling Guatemalan farming town of 1,500 people near the Mexican border. The following account is based on more than two dozen interviews with family members, government officials, border patrol agents and human rights workers.\n\nPaiz, a restaurant cook who had worked in Mexico, hoped to find work in the United States and send money back home. His uncle, Gomez, planned to join his wife and three children in South Carolina.\n\nHe had been deported two years earlier and tried and failed three times since to make it back. This would be his fourth attempt.\n\nLucy Nicholson/Reuters\n\n\"The family is disintegrating because here we don\u2019t have work,\" said Paiz's father, Miguel Domingo Paiz, 59.\n\nDomingo knows that leaving for a better future is a life-or-death gamble. His eldest son Ovidio was shot dead in Mexico last year after moving there to find a job.\n\nIn recent years, the number of Guatemalans caught crossing illegally into the United States has risen steadily from about 57,000 in 2015 to nearly 117,000 in 2018, and is second only to apprehensions of Mexicans.\n\nThe figures, experts say, reflect a greater willingness among Guatemalans to brave the perils of migration to escape rising violence, poverty and political turmoil.\n\nLucy Nicholson/Reuters\n\nPaiz told his twin brother, Gaspar, that he made an initial payment of $500 to a smuggler -- known as a \"coyote\" -- who promised to get him across the border. He would owe another $5,500 if he made it.\n\nAfter making their way to the Mexican town of Sasabe on the border with Arizona, Paiz and Gomez waited 12 days for their turn to cross with a guide, according to family members.\n\nIn one of their last phone conversations, Paiz told his father: \"Soon it will be my turn.\"\n\nLucy Nicholson/Reuters\n\nAfter crossing and walking for about six hours, Paiz began to complain of a severe headache. He collapsed next to a dirt track called Cemetery Road.\n\nTheir guide poured water over Paiz's head. When that didn't help, he took off with three other migrants in their group. Gomez stayed with his nephew.\n\nLucy Nicholson/Reuters\n\nGomez's efforts to revive his nephew failed. He called family members in Aguacate, and told Paiz's mother to pray. Then, knowing it would mean another failed attempt to rejoin his family, Gomez placed the 911 call.\n\nAt first light on Sept. 10, helicopters launched by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Pima County started scouring known migrant paths in the area. An elite Border Patrol medical unit set out across the desert.\n\nFollowing the 911 dispatcher's instruction, Gomez lit a fire in the hope that it could guide the rescuers. But it burned hot and clean, producing little smoke.\n\nLucy Nicholson/Reuters\n\nIt wasn't until 1:30 that afternoon that agents got word that a rancher had happened across the two men.\n\nA short while later, Border Patrol agents reached the location and took Gomez into custody.\n\nThey took Paiz away in a black body bag.\n\nThe Pima County medical examiner would later determine Paiz succumbed to heat stroke. Seven weeks after his death, Paiz's body was flown to Guatemala City, a journey paid for by the Guatemalan government. His coffin arrived along with a half dozen others, all bearing remains of Guatemalan migrants.\n\nA Red Cross ambulance transported Paiz's body on the 12-hour drive along primitive roads from the capital to Aguacate. His family followed behind in a bus.\n\nLucy Nicholson/Reuters\n\n\"We always played together. We would go to the mountains together to collect wood,\" said Gaspar, his twin. \"We discussed which one of us would go to the U.S. and decided it would be Misael.\"\n\nIn Aguacate, some 250 people met the ambulance transporting Paiz's body. They stood in ankle-deep mud and pouring rain as eight men lifted his coffin out and took it into the family home.\n\nLucy Nicholson/Reuters\n\nFor hours, Paiz's mother, brothers and sisters wailed while others sang in a room illuminated by a single electric bulb hanging from the ceiling.\n\nThe following morning, a band played marimba music next to the coffin in Paiz's family home. A woman cooked a pot of stew on a wood-burning stove.\n\nPaiz was buried that afternoon in a concrete tomb on a hillside, next to his elder brother Ovidio.\n\nStory written by Andrew Hay"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Congo rebels attack, burn homes near UN base in east", "description": "Congo's army spokesman says rebels have burned homes and a car in a neighborhood in the country's east where U.N. peacekeeping forces have a base", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/congo-rebels-attack-burn-homes-base-east-59263819", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T14:28:35Z", "content": "Congo's army spokesman says rebels have burned homes and a car in a neighborhood in the east of the country where U.N. peacekeeping forces have a base.

The longer-running tribunals covering genocide in Rwanda and war crimes in the former Yugoslavia ran up costs of as much as $2 billion \u2014 though both tried many more people than were called to account in Cambodia for crimes committed during the 1975-79 regime of the late Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot.\n\nOn Friday, the tribunal convicted Nuon Chea, 92, and Khieu Samphan, 87, the last surviving Khmer Rouge leaders, of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, and sentenced them to life in prison. The only other person who has been convicted is Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, who as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center in Phnom Penh.\n\nJustice is the primary goal. But international tribunals, trying people accused of crimes on a national scale, also serve to promote human rights and establish a historical record, among other targets.\n\nEven the most bullish observers acknowledge the shortcomings of the Cambodian tribunal, officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, or ECCC. The rules hammered out in extensive negotiations between the United Nations and the Cambodian government hobbled its proceedings in ways that were not always foreseeable.\n\nThe ECCC was set up as a hybrid court, meaning every international prosecutor and judge was paired with a Cambodian counterpart. However, what was a political atmosphere encouraging cooperation when the U.N. agreement was signed in 2003 deteriorated, as democratic space has shrunk under Cambodia's long-serving, autocratic Prime Minister Hun Sen.\n\n\"Hybrid courts require domestic and international partners to share the steering wheel. They tend to function well only when the two drivers want to head in the same general direction,\" said John Ciorciari, a professor at the University of Michigan and co-author of a book about the tribunal. \"When they do, mixed tribunals can help fill gaps in otherwise frail domestic systems. When interests clash, these efforts to share sovereignty are prone to crash.\"\n\nThe main case in point: Hun Sen \u2014 himself a former Khmer Rouge commander who defected from the group when it was in power \u2014 declaring no more suspects should be prosecuted, saying without justification that such action could cause unrest.\n\nIt didn't help that the U.N. agreement's vague wording of who could be targeted for prosecution \u2014 senior Khmer Rouge leaders and those most responsible for the atrocities \u2014 proved to be more restrictive than open-ended.\n\n\"All tribunals of this character have political restraints, and so that is not unique to the ECCC,\" said David Scheffer, a law professor at Northwestern University and former U.S. ambassador at large for war crimes. Other points he mentioned that delayed the proceedings included the protection of due process rights and the unusual combination of a civil law investigating judicial procedure alongside a common law prosecutorial model.\n\n\"One can always surmise about more being done,\" said Scheffer, who also served as the U.N.'s special expert on assistance to the Khmer Rouge trials. \"But that was the negotiated reality of this particular tribunal.\"\n\nNevertheless, he gave high marks to the tribunal's performance, saying its main contribution has been both domestic and international justice rendered against some of the major figures in the Pol Pot regime.\n\n\"The Cambodian people sought justice and the ECCC delivered a significant measure of it,\" Scheffer said in an email interview. \"The ECCC also established a historical record, albeit not comprehensive, that otherwise never would have been uncovered.\"\n\nAdama Dieng, the U.N. special adviser on the prevention of genocide, also said Friday's convictions showed that \"justice will prevail, and that impunity should never be accepted for genocide and other atrocity crimes.\"\n\nPolitical education is an area where the tribunal has succeeded, said Heather Ryan, who has monitored the trials for the Open Society Justice Initiative, an independent international human rights organization.\n\n\"The court has made a huge contribution to helping the world and Cambodians better understand what occurred during the Khmer Rouge regime,\" said Ryan. \"It has triggered discussions at all levels of Cambodian society about not only the past, but concepts of impunity, justice and accountability relevant to the current political situation in Cambodia.\"\n\nOther observers were less impressed.\n\nTheary Seng, a U.S.-trained lawyer, writer and political analyst based in Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital, who is an outspoken critic of Hun Sen's government, called the tribunal \"a complete failure for international justice\" because it didn't accomplish any of the established goals of reconciliation, symbolic justice and combating impunity.\n\nSeng, whose parents were killed by the Khmer Rouge, pointed out that the hope that at least some of the Cambodian judges, prosecutors and lawyers that the government placed in the tribunal would somehow become champions of judicial fairness and the rule of law has been the opposite of fulfilled: they have all been deeply implicated in government abuse and perversion of the domestic justice system.\n\nShe said her top concern now was for the integrity of the tribunal's documents to be preserved for researchers.\n\nIt is likely that the voluminous documentation used by the tribunal will be handed over to the government or institution controlled by the government, she said.\n\n\"This means that the printed documents could be selectively destroyed and the electronic version could be subtly altered,\" she warned. \"Future researchers writing the history of Cambodia will not know what's what.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Sopheng Cheang in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Facebook says steep rise in data requests from Indian gov't", "description": "Facebook says there was a steep rise in data requests from India's government in the first half of this year as compared to the previous two years", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/facebook-steep-rise-data-requests-indian-govt-59261981", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T09:04:51Z", "content": "Facebook says there was a steep rise in data requests from India's government in the first half of this year as compared to the previous two years.

The Russian Space Agency launched its own supplies to the International Space Station on Friday, just 15 hours earlier.\n\nThe U.S. delivery will arrive at the orbiting lab Monday, a day after the Russian shipment. Among the 7,400 pounds (3,350 kilograms) of goods inside the Cygnus capsule: ice cream and fresh fruit for the three space station residents, and a 3D printer that recycles old plastic into new parts.\n\nThanksgiving turkey dinners \u2014 rehydratable, of course \u2014 are already aboard the 250-mile-high outpost. The space station is currently home to an American, a German and a Russian.\n\nThere's another big event coming up, up there: The space station marks its 20th year in orbit on Tuesday. The first section launched on Nov. 20, 1998, from Kazakhstan.\n\n\"As we celebrate 20 years of the International Space Station,\" Montalbano noted, \"one of the coolest things is the cooperation we have across the globe.\" Then there's the U.S. commercial effort to keep the space station stocked and, beginning next year, to resume crew launches from Cape Canaveral. \"To me, it's been a huge success,\" he said.\n\nThis Cygnus, or Swan, is named the S.S. John Young to honor the legendary astronaut who walked on the moon and commanded the first space shuttle flight. He died in January.\n\nIt is the first commercial cargo ship to bear Northrop Grumman's name. Northrop Grumman acquired Orbital ATK in June. SpaceX is NASA's other commercial shipper for the space station; its Dragon capsule is set to lift off in early December.\n\nExperiments arriving via the Cygnus will observe how cement solidifies in weightlessness, among other things. There's also medical, spacesuit and other equipment to replace items that never made it to orbit last month because of a Russian rocket failure; the two men who were riding the rocket survived their emergency landing. Three other astronauts are set to launch from Kazakhstan on Dec. 3."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Florida high school massacre panel considers recommendations", "description": "State commission investigating Florida high school massacre begins discussions on what recommendations it will make to bolster student safety, prevent future shooting attacks", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/florida-high-school-massacre-panel-considers-recommendations-59261932", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/WireAP_44e11779f08c468faa90e1d44742c5e0_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T08:39:37Z", "content": "The state commission investigating the Florida high school massacre began discussions Friday on what recommendations it will make regarding student safety, mental health and steps to prevent future school shootings. The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Co\u2026 [+4766 chars]", "fulltext": "The state commission investigating the Florida high school massacre began discussions Friday on what recommendations it will make regarding student safety, mental health and steps to prevent future school shootings.\n\nThe Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Commission didn't pass any specific recommendations Friday at its latest gathering to consider the Feb. 14 attack that killed 14 students and three staff members at the school in Parkland. But it decided it will focus its initial batch of recommendations on less controversial areas such as school hardening before addressing difficult issues like mental health.\n\nThe 14-member panel must file its initial report to outgoing Gov. Rick Scott, his successor and the Legislature by Jan. 1.\n\nState Sen. Lauren Book, a member of the commission, said she expects all legislators will read the report and take it seriously, given the magnitude of the tragedy.\n\n\"We all within the Legislature come from different backgrounds and different knowledge bases,\" Book said. \"Giving some information is good, getting too much into the weeds is dangerous.\"\n\nStoneman Douglas social studies teacher Ernie Rospierski, who herded students down a stairwell and used his body to barricade the door behind them after being grazed by two bullets, told commissioners to be \"very careful\" about putting more safety requirements on teachers because they are already overworked. But, he said, the panel needs to begin writing \"the playbook\" for preventing future tragedies.\n\n\"Until that is finished, we are going to see this again and again,\" Rospierski said.\n\nThe commissioners decided not to go through their items publicly Friday. They said they would review possible recommendations accumulated by their staff individually, submit suggestions and concerns and then debate them publicly at their meeting next month.\n\nMeanwhile, the attorney for the sheriff's deputy who was on the campus during the massacre started a charity website to raise money for the man's legal defense. Joseph DiRuzzo III started a GoFundMe page for now-retired Broward County sheriff's Deputy Scot Peterson in hopes of raising $150,000 \"to defend him against any spurious claims of criminal liability.\" As of Friday afternoon, $40 had been raised before the drive appeared shut down.\n\nDiRuzzo noted the GoFundMe page in a lawsuit filed this week to block Scott Peterson from being forced to testify before the commission. Many commissioners have called Peterson \"a coward\" for not charging into the building with his handgun and confronting the shooter, who was armed with a semi-automatic rifle.\n\nSecurity video shows Peterson arrived outside the three-story building where the killings happened shortly after the shooting began, about the same time the gunman finished slaying 11 people on the first floor. Peterson drew his handgun, but retreated to cover next to the neighboring building. The video shows Peterson never left that spot for 50 minutes, even after other deputies and police officers arrived on campus and went inside.\n\nPanel members have said they believe Peterson's inaction allowed suspect Nikolas Cruz to climb to the third floor, where five students and one teacher were killed. They believe if Peterson, 55, had confronted Cruz and engaged him in a shootout he could have killed him or given others more time to reach safety.\n\nDiRuzzo said in his lawsuit that as the first deputy on scene, Peterson was the incident commander charged with coordinating law enforcement's response until relieved by a superior. DiRuzzo said Peterson was never relieved and fulfilled that duty by directing officers into the building and ordering the closing of the school and surrounding streets.\n\nPinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, the panel's chairman, said Friday that DiRuzzo's lawsuit is \"a work of fiction.\"\n\n\"Peterson did not do his job. Peterson is a failure, and he should be embarrassed and held accountable for what he did not do,\" Gualtieri said.\n\nAlso Friday, the commission learned that eight of the state's 67 countywide school districts haven't filed safety assessments mandated after the massacre.\n\nState Education Commissioner Pam Stewart, a commission member, said Friday there's little she can do to districts that don't file the assessments, which were due Oct. 31. She said one county's report was delayed because of Hurricane Michael and others are completed but awaiting approval of their district school boards.\n\nPolk County Sheriff Grady Judd, a commission member, said the new state law should require the suspension of a district's superintendent and board chair if the deadline is broken.\n\nThe panel has been meeting periodically since April and includes law enforcement, education and mental health officials, a legislator and the fathers of two dead students.\n\nCruz, a 20-year-old former Stoneman Douglas student, is charged with the slayings. He has pleaded not guilty, but his attorneys have said he would plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Joe Goldman", "title": "Argentine submarine found at bottom of Atlantic after year of searching", "description": "The submarine was lost on Nov. 15, 2017.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/argentine-submarine-found-bottom-atlantic-ocean-year-searching/story?id=59261897", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/ara-san-juan-ap-mo-20181117_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T08:25:36Z", "content": "An Argentine submarine that went missing almost exactly one year ago has been found at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.

He said they also discussed joint oil projects and improving transport links between the two countries.\n\nTrade between the two countries was some $7 billion in 2017, and they have vowed to boost it to $8.5 billion this year. Rouhani said it could eventually reach $20 billion a year.\n\nSalih also pledged to improve ties, and suggested the formation of a \"new regional system\" including Iraq and Iran, one based on \"political integrity, national interests and cooperation between nations and governments.\" He did not elaborate.\n\nLater in the day, Salih met Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who urged for unity among the two countries and said Iraqis should resist foreign intervention.\n\n\"Some governments in the region and beyond the region have a strong grudge toward Islam, Shiite and Sunni, and interfere in the internal affairs of Iraq,\" said Khamenei. \"The impudent and clear enemy must be strongly resisted.\" He did not name any country.\n\nPresident Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers in May.

The full brunt of the measures came into effect Nov. 5 when the U.S. re-imposed oil and banking sanctions.\n\nThe U.S., which provided crucial military support to Iraq in its battle against the Islamic State group, has granted Iraq a 45-day waiver to allow it to continue to purchase gas and electricity from Iran.\n\nSalih said Iraq should not be \"a field for struggle between conflicting demands and wills.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Face transplant recipient's mom learns about renowned reconstructive surgeon: Part 2", "description": "Cam Underwood had already undergone multiple surgeries on his disfigured face when his mother Bev first read about the work of Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/2020/video/face-transplant-recipients-mom-learns-renowned-reconstructive-surgeon-59257363", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/2020/181116_2020_act2_3_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T07:19:15Z", "content": "Now Playing: The emotional moment face transplant recipient thanks his donor's mom Now Playing: Face transplant recipient has emotional meeting with donor's mother Now Playing: 26-year-old face transplant recipient: 'I see me': Part 1 Now Playing: Face transp\u2026 [+1348 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Face transplant recipient's mom learns about renowned reconstructive surgeon: Part 2\n\nSunday, June 26th, 12:17 am. Mom calls and says cam shot himself and they're headed Rideout. Reporter: Cam Underwood's sister Julie started writing in a diary as her brother's life was hanging in the balance at Rideout memorial hospital. Even now her written words are hard to fathom. Doctors tell my parents cam's face is dust. And that if he even lives, he will not see or talk. Reporter: The 24-year-old put a loaded shot gun to his chin, an attempt to take his own life. But it didn't work. The blast, which commonly happens in these scenarios, before the projectile comes out of a firearm, there's usually pressure fire. That usually is enough to deflect the face. And that's why most individuals that attempt this miss their brain. Reporter: In the aftermath, searing words from the emergency room doctors. They were not very gentle with us. They said there was nothing left. They said his face was dust, and he would not make it. They told us he had no tongue, no teeth, no chin, no cheekbones, no facial structure. Nothing! They asked us if we wanted to go in and see our son. How do you go in and look at your son when there is nothing left? Reporter: How do you prepare yourself as a mom to see that? I don't know. Hoping that you're dreaming and you wake up and it was all a nightmare. That's what you hope for. Reporter: The reality, incomprehensible. His face, so gruesome, we've elected not to show you some of the photos the family gave us. It wasn't really a face, you know. It was pretty horrific. Reporter: So horrific, they move cam to a top trauma facility, uc Davis medical center. It took our breath away when Cameron came into the unit. It was so devastating. Reporter: And incredibly, it appears cam will survive after all. But survive with a fate perhaps worse than death. How do you live without a face? There's no plastic surgery that could ever make him look completely Normal again. He's gonna have to live the rest of his life looking and feeling like a monster. Reporter: Renowned plastic surgeon Dr. Lee pu does what he can to sustain life, implanting 12 titanium plates to keep what's left of cam's shattered skull intact. I took a titanium plate and plate his nose, interorbirtal rim, mid face, upper jaw. Reporter: He can't breathe or eat on his own. Cam was alive. But how could he ever really live? I cried every day for a year. Every single day. I would've changed places with him any day. I would've taken his pain any day, but I couldn't. What kind of quality of life would he have, if he didn't want to live with all that he had going for him? Then why would he want to continue on now? Reporter: It was six months before cam could leave the hospital, and even then, he would wear a mask everywhere he went. And I would see people stare at him and he would notice that. The worst part was the little kids, kind of hide or stare at him and hang on to mom and dad because he looked so pitiful. Reporter: But then cam's doctor, Dr. Pu, uttered the words would change cam's fate forever. Though at first, they sounded more like science fiction than medical science. Face transplant. I'm thinking, face transplant? You know, can they actually -- what is a face transplant? We had never heard of such a thing ever. Reporter: And no sooner did Bev find herself at the checkout counter of her local grocery store, coincidentally thumbing through this issue of \"People\" magazine. How fated was that? And it wasn't on anything on the outside of the cover that caught my attention.. Reporter: The article inside about a face transplant. It was the same story that ABC news \"Nightline\" had already covered. The story of Patrick Hardison, a Mississippi fireman who was horribly disfigured trying to rescue a woman from her burning home. The ceiling collapsed, and I could just see everything coming down. Reporter: Like cam, Patrick would survive, but his scalp, ears, nose, eyelids and lips were gone. In 2015, at nyu Langone medical center in New York, Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez agreed to perform what was then the most extensive face transplant ever done. I'm saying, get me back as Normal looking as you can. Reporter: The operation took 26 hours. This was the amazing transformation! All made possible, because of a donor. A reminder that one man's mortality is another man's miracle. So, it's no wonder. As soon as Bev learns about that story -- A face transplant. It's like something out of a movie. So you pick up this magazine, and you see the name Dr. Rodriguez. Reporter: All she can think of is what Dr. Rodriguez might mean for her son. And so I decided that I would go ahead and send an email to Dr. Rodriguez. Reporter: But cam will first have to prove he wants a second chance at life. There was reluctance because of the concern to take away his life during a bout of depression. Reporter: The fact that he had become this disfigured. Correct. Reporter: Because he attempted suicide.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: 26-year-old face transplant recipient: 'I see me': Part 1", "description": "When he was 24, Cameron Underwood says he was looking for a way out when he decided to try to take his own life.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/2020/video/26-year-face-transplant-recipient-part-59257364", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/2020/181116_2020_act1_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T07:17:43Z", "content": "Now Playing: A mother's decision to donate son's face: How doctors approach, support families Now Playing: Face transplant recipient has emotional meeting with donor's mother Now Playing: 26-year-old face transplant recipient: 'I see me': Part 1 Now Playing: \u2026 [+1348 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for 26-year-old face transplant recipient: 'I see me': Part 1\n\nIt's remarkable seeing and knowing what you've been through. Can you walk us through what you got from will and what you were able to keep? I'm on the top part. So it starts right here and it goes down and then everything under is will's. Reporter: It's one of the most unusual questions I've ever posed to anyone. Asking a young man for a guided tour of the features of his face. So when you look in the mirror, what do you see? Me? I see me. Reporter: But before 26-year-old Cameron Underwood wants the world to see the me he sees, he first wants you to understand how his former face and the face of another young man he never knew became one. How together, cam was given a second chance at life. So much of this story is not anything that anyone would ever prepare for in their life. It's unimaginable, like you said, how did this happen? Reporter: Cam's mom, Bev Bailey potter, believes god put her on Earth to be a wife and mother -- her greatest joy. Her four children, the oldest, Julie and then the three boys, Aaron, Brad and her youngest, cam. They were just so close and I always took pride in that. I think there's a bond between the three of us that's different than any other brother bond I've ever seen. Reporter: A close knit family grounded in their faith. Cam's grandfather founded the united pentacostal church in the northern California agricultural community of yuba city. Faith is the essence of everything in our family. Without that foundation, I think this journey would've been a lot more difficult. Reporter: Hunting is religion for cam and the Underwoods as well. We're really an outdoors family. We all like the outdoors. Hey, cam! He grew up on the lake. He was natural athlete. He was good. Show me the game ball. He is gifted in so many areas, so many ways. Con, son. He was easy. A little more on the shy side but just a wonderful spirit about him, easy going. But by the first time he gets to high school, his spirit isn't what people notice about him. It's his face. Cam was a hand some boy. His smile would light up his face and it was so evident in his eyes. He was just a handsome boy! Women started noticing him more and more and more. We would walk into places and you know, ladies heads would turn. Reporter: But for cam, there's only one girlfriend. I would say he was in love with her for sure. Reporter: The couple date for years after high school. Planning a future, cam starts working in his step father's business. Heavy equipment repair. He made so much money, he bought his own house at the age of 19. But the family says cam becomes a workaholic, pushing himself. Working too hard and playing hard too. You know we'd call each other, we'd meet up usually at cam's house and go and drink some beers. It started out it was fun. You're 21 everyone drinks and goes and has a good time. Reporter: But cam isn't everyone. His mom Bev says even with everything going for him, that bright light that had always shone in cam's eyes begins to fade. Good looking, driven, self-sufficient and yet at some point you noticed something dark. You know, I have a clear memory in my mind. I saw him walk across the parking lot and he just looked so sad and so empty. I just thought, what's he going through? Is he unhappy? Reporter: Turns out, he is. The family says cam kept his loved ones completely in the dark, rarely showing his emotions, even as the life he counted on was falling apart. Like when he and his girlfriend broke up. I think being with somebody for that long, obviously there's a huge gap left in your life now. I know he started going out more and, you know, partying a little more at that time. Reporter: And over the next few years, cam and his closest old cohorts had drifted apart. Drinking buddy Kevin started a family of his own and both his older brothers now had new jobs and moved out of state. What impact did their absence have on cam, his best friends? Huge. He was alone? He was alone. Reporter: Well, not completely alone. I spent more time with cam than anybody, yeah. We were together nearly seven days a week. This is cam's uncle Lonnie who admits a big part of their togetherness involved drinking, a lot of drinking. Bev was concerned about cam and I, our relationship, as far as the alcohol and everything else. Did you know that cam was drinking too much? Yes. Yes, I did. And I was worried. Reporter: But less obvious is the underlying depression. Still it's a shock when cam not so subtly hints he's thinking of taking his own life. He didn't like spell it out, but I mean I knew it was with a gun and I knew that was what he was planning, but I mean it was very alarming. I understand his father at one point removed the guns from cam's home. Because I asked him to. When I went over and got his guns, because his mom said he was talking about killing himself, I never thought he would go that far. Turns out cam's father Randy removed all the guns. All, but one. A shotgun cam kept in his safe. Which brings us to a Sunday night that June. I get a text from cam. It's like hey why don't you just come down and stay the night? I'm like okay. I got to his house and all the lights were on, which I expected, door was unlocked. I walked in, nobody in the living room and I figured he was probably in the bedroom. Reporter: Lonnie walks into that bedroom and into a nightmare. Blood everywhere. And cam staggering against the wall. I think that is probably the point I went into shock. Reporter: Cam had put a shotgun under his chin and pulled the trigger. He is rushed to the hospital. Do you remember what you were thinking? I was praying is what I was doing. That's what I was doing.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Surgeon meets potential face transplant recipient before agreeing to operate: Part 3", "description": "Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez met with Cam Underwood in person to discuss his concerns, including Underwood's struggle with depression and his attempted suicide.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/2020/video/surgeon-meets-potential-face-transplant-recipient-agreeing-operate-59257361", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/2020/181116_2020_act3_1_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T07:04:28Z", "content": "Now Playing: A mother's decision to donate son's face: How doctors approach, support families Now Playing: US's youngest face transplant recipient shares story of suicide survival, hope Now Playing: 26-year-old face transplant recipient: 'I see me': Part 1 No\u2026 [+1359 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Surgeon meets potential face transplant recipient before agreeing to operate: Part 3\n\nReporter: Long before Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez took over the renowned plastic surgery program at nyu Langone medical center in New York, when he was just a student, he went to see a movie.

Reporter: Rodriguez had no idea he was seeing a kind of preview of his own career. As a matter of fact I thought, \"That's impossible.\" No one thinks of that movie as real or even happening in the near future. I never thought about that. Reporter: If face transplants were long shots back then, you might say Rodriguez was too. In fact, when he first applied to medical school from his hometown of Miami he didn't get in. I was not gonna give up. I had to do something to take care of patients. Reporter: So he initially went to dental school and eventually landed at the prestigious Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. In an amazing coincidence, Dr. Rodriguez just happened to be there in 2000, as ABC news cameras captured a remarkable moment, a plastic surgery resident quitting on camera. Her colleagues are stunned to learn that she is resigning as a doctor at Hopkins. And I interviewed for that position and I got it. Reporter: As he progressed in the field, learning skills to reshape bodies, he started seeing soldiers returning home from combat in Afghanistan and Iraq with horrific facial injuries, far beyond what plastic surgery could fix. Imagine looking in the mirror every day without a Normal face. It doesn't look like you. No, it's a complete identity crisis. But the face is the only part of the body you cannot conceal. You can't hide it. It's such an important part of our body. What defines us, what people see for the first time. Without a Normal face, it's not living. Reporter: In 2012, Dr. Rodriguez did his first face transplant in Maryland. Then he moved on to nyu, where he did his second in 2015. The one on the Mississippi firefighter, the same one on \"Nightline\" that cam's mom Bev now knew about. Cam's mom sent me an email. Her story was very moving.

Right away, when I saw the image, I knew that that injury there was no way I could ever make him Normal with conventional surgery. Reporter: At least on paper, cam was a potential candidate to become Dr. Rodriguez's third transplant patient. How do you pick then who is a candidate for a face transplant and who isn't? That's a very difficult question. Reporter: A question, made more difficult when you consider that the procedure costs over a million dollars. The hard question for everyone, was cam worth it? How worried were you that he might try this again, that he might try to end his life again? Everybody was very worried about that. Reporter: So next a 3,000-mile scouting trip of sorts to yuba city, California to meet cam and his family face-to-face. The fact that he actually had suicidal ideation, on which he tried to deliver on, act on is still a concern and something we have to talk about. I don't think that anybody knew that it was a test per se. I think we did understand that he had to be sure that their investment in Cameron was secure and that he was not the kind of patient that would take this amazing miraculous gift and throw it away. This is only something we offer to select individuals. You used to race? I need to know that I have a fighter in my hands. You ever get this out to ride? Yeah, I rode it last week. Did you? Yeah. And this person's willing to do whatever it takes to have this operation be successful. We should never give up on these individuals that go through this incident in their life. What was it about the drinking that made you feel that way? I really hated it that I was drinking so much. I don't need it anymore like I felt I did before. I think it's very important that people understand the severity of undergoing this operation. It's not a quick fix. No, not at all. Reporter: For starters, a face transplant means a lifetime of treatments with harsh side effects to prevent rejection. And doctors say they just don't know enough yet to predict survival beyond ten years. Maybe we can only promise him ten years of life. As a mom, though, did that give you pause? It did, but this was cam's decision to be made too. Is that your truck, cam? That's his truck. Reporter: By the end of the visit, both doctor and patient were on board. Being accepted into this program is very much like winning the lottery. But instead of winning $500 million, Cameron wins a second chance at life. We had hope for the first time. And that's something when you felt hopeless up until that point. As a mom, you want to fix things. Reporter: But fixing things now would require one more huge step. How difficult is it to find a donor? The donor is the most difficult part of this. It's like a needle in a\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Face transplant donor's mother's difficult decision: Part 4", "description": "Will Fisher had signed up to be an organ donor, but after he died, Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez approached his mother with a very different, sensitive request.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/2020/video/face-transplant-donors-mothers-difficult-decision-part-59257360", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/2020/181116_2020_act4_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T07:03:11Z", "content": "Now Playing: A mother's decision to donate son's face: How doctors approach, support families Now Playing: Surgeon overseeing care for US's youngest face-transplant recipient: 'Katie was a fighter' Now Playing: 26-year-old face transplant recipient: 'I see me\u2026 [+1371 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Face transplant donor's mother's difficult decision: Part 4\n\nReporter: Yuba city, California, is located near the feather river at the base of Sutter buttes. Referred to as the smallest mountain range in the world, but one of its sons has one especially steep mountain left to climb. So now you've got a doctor. You've got a procedure. You've got hope, but you need a donor. But we need a donor. What was the waiting like? It was tough. Reporter: It's a kind of macabre paradox for a mother, knowing that her son's good fortune will only come at the expense and sad misfortune of another mother's son, somewhere, sometime. Just a kid who had so much to give, and it was cut short. Until it happens to you, you can't believe what it feels like to lose a child, especially when your child's death was preventable. Reporter: His name was will, Sally fisher's only child, whom she raised as a single mom in New York City. What was his childhood like? He had a pretty remarkable childhood. I mean, he was an amazing kid. He was extremely compassionate. He was extremely kind, and generous to a fault. And as a mother, I'm sure that's what you're most proud of. Yeah. Reporter: But it wasn't just will's spirit that made him special, she says, it was also his brilliant mind. His mind worked in ways that you couldn't believe. He'd do wood working one day. He'd do ceramics another day. The third day he would do chess. Reporter: Will became a child prodigy, competing in more than 200 tournaments. He won many titles. A New York state champion. The Pennsylvania state championship. Reporter: His family seeing comparisons to the legendary chess champ, and namesake of the movie \"Searching for Bobby Fischer.\" I'm not concerned about other things. Like friendships. My sister was very worried cause she said, \"Look at Bobby Fischer. They're all insane. Doesn't it worry you that he likes chess?\" Reporter: By his teen years, Sally was worried about will, seeing him struggle. Unable to connect with his peers. It's hard to be a kid when you have the mind of an adult. He was diagnosed with mental illness when he was in college. Reporter: Sally says the only thing worse than her son's illness was the way the world began to treat him. There's tremendous stigma. Society disregards and discards people with mental illness. He wasn't happy. So you don't want to see your child suffer, especially suffer when you know that we're still in a situation where the illness that he has is something that the world doesn't care about. Reporter: Will had to leave college and back home in New York, he was given psychiatric treatment, but Sally says eventually those prescribed medications weren't enough. She was fearing the worst. What were you afraid was going to happen? I knew he was self-medicating. What do you think he was doing with those drugs? Masking pain? I think that he was trying to feel better. He didn't want to die? He didn't. I don't think he wanted to die. He said, \"Mommy, don't let me die.\" Reporter: It was a night last December, just days shy of new year's, when will ended up in the emergency room, but once he was stabilized, the hospital wanted to discharge him. Sally says she begged them not to. I don't think it was fair to discharge will to care for himself, when he was clearly unable to. I said, you can't. If you discharge him, he will be dead in 24 hours, and it was the next day that I walked into his room, and he was like this. Slumped over, he had stopped breathing. Reporter: This time, it would be too late to save will. That brilliant mind declared brain dead by the time he arrived at the hospital. I think there was a combination of opioids in his system, and I'm not sure which had been prescribed, but it was both prescribed and not prescribed. That's what ended his life. A lethal combination. It's just such a loss, you know. And you just can't -- you can't believe that he can't -- that he can't live his dreams. Reporter: But what if through will someone else could? Still on a breathing machine, measures were then taken to harvest will's still living precious organs. In the midst of your unimaginable grief and shock, you decided to take measures to make sure that will's organs could be saved to be donated. Actually it wasn't my decision. It was will's. Reporter: It turns out, years earlier, as a teenager, will had registered with New York state to be an organ donor. He wouldn't understand logically why someone wouldn't be an organ donor. Maybe some of that compassion that you were talking about. Yeah, if you die and you have something that somebody could use, why wouldn't you save a life? Reporter: Organ donation is one thing, but donating his face? It's not an ordinary thing to be asked to donate. No. Reporter: Dr. Rodriguez says the request is a very special one, handled with utmost sensitivity. That's asked at a separate time. A separate consent. The idea you know a face is -- It's so personal. Yeah, and especially Cameron suffered his injury at the age of 23, which was the age Willie was when he died, and I just thought, he can give this kid a face, and Willie had a beautiful face. There was no question in my mind that this is something will would have wanted. Reporter: When Dr. Rodriguez rushed from nyu to the hospital where will was, he could hardly believe what he learned. Will had all the pre-requisites, skin tone, the same size skull, plus a matching blood type. But beyond those physical similarities, Rodriguez couldn't believe how closely mirrored their emotional plights were as well. Both cam and will shared commonalities in their life with issues related to depression, dependence, and we knew that these families were meant to at some point meet.

Weekend Deals only at Target. January 5th, 2018. As they arrive at nyu Langone medical center, an unplanned and highly emotional encounter in the lobby with will's mother, Sally. Welcome to New York. Thank god for you. I'm so happy you're -- are you mom? Oh, my god. Thank you. What did she say to you? She's thanking us. Giving this gift to us and then thanking us. Thank you for letting my son live on. You have no idea what this means to me. You have no idea what this means to us. I don't think I would have survived will's death had it not been for Cameron and his family. It was very difficult because no matter the condition of my son, I still had my son. She's lost her son. You're going to meet again. You'll see him on the other side. Reporter: Here's what will happen next. In one O.R., doctors will remove the lower portion of will's face, extracting what they need. Will's facial muscles, nerves, jaw and teeth. In the other O.R., doctors will prep cam, removing the scarred, damaged portions of his face. Only to be replaced with wills. The requisite parts of two once handsome strangers that together will become one new man. Often people think it's just like putting on a mask. It's not that simple. Reporter: It's 6:00 A.M. As Bev kisses cam goodbye and he is wheeled into surgery. A team of more than 100 is ready to go in side by side operating rooms. What did you have to do to make this face transplant work for cam? The face needs to fit like a puzzle, and that's a tricky thing. Reporter: That preparation alone takes more than 12 hours. The actual facial reconstruction will take just as long. We prayed for those doctors throughout the night. They're pulling an all nighter. None of them are leaving. No sleep around the clock. Standing over in that operating room for 25 hours straight? It's hard to believe. But, there's so much adrenaline pumping through your bloodstream. Those hours go by like that. This has to not only look like a Normal face but to work like a Normal face. Reporter: But in the lead up to those transformational overnight hours, one remarkable part of the process cannot be overlooked. There are 3D masks that you actually create -- Yes. -- For you do for the donor. What is it and how and why is it done? A mask for the donor? When we remove the face, there's no wound to close. We have an open cavity, and that's very difficult for members of our team and our staff and our nursing in the operating room to see that individual leave the operating room with gauze throughout their face. And we are very fortunate that we have incredible technology right here on our campus at nyu where we can take 3D photography and that can be printed into a high fidelity 3D mask, which is an exact replica of the donor. Reporter: It's a comfort to the donor's family too. It was nice after he had been declared dead that, even though it was only me that saw him with the mask, that I could see him. I hope that people will realize, for people who wanna have open viewings and open caskets and that kinda stuff, I mean, it looks just like will. Reporter: Dawn arrives. More than 21 grueling hours have elapsed. When Dr. Rodriguez waits for the critical moment in every transplant he's ever done. Will the blood return to the face? Everything is pink. So at this point, I'm feeling pretty good. Reporter: Blood is flowing, everything is working. A few hours later, 8:50 A.M., it's a bona fide medical marvel. I had prayed for that miracle every day for a year, and my son had a nose and he had a mouth and he had teeth. And it was just a happy moment. When you feel comfortable I want you to look at yourself I remember the first time I saw myself after the transplant. And what was that like? Wow. That that was breathtaking, and I was just blown away. You know? Relieved and excited all you know, at the same time. Can you walk us through what you got from will and what you were able to keep? Which brings us back to where we started. Only this time, cam is ready for his close up. This is cam's new face. So it starts right here, and it goes down. The eyes are mine, and then everything under is will's. So that's all will, and then will's jaw and lower and upper jaw is his. Is that will's facial hair then, technically? Technically, yes. You should be able to feel 9 vibrations. Do you see a combination of the former you and will together? A little bit. You know? I just see it as mine. Reporter: These pictures show cam's remarkable progression. Ten incredible months of healing. What about everything else, in terms of like breathing, smiling, all the things that faces do to make it work? I can breathe you know, though my nose, and through my mouth and smiling, you know. I can smile. I am shy. I am shy. I first met cam in speech therapy last summer. 'Cause you know what you wanna say, and not being able to make your body say it. I mean I'm impressed. It's a lot a lot of work to teach yourself how to talk again with a new mouth, and new teeth, and lips, and it's just like a baby trying to learn how to talk. Part of the recovery has been extensive dental work. And you can see now, that his teeth are fitting perfectly. It's miraculous! You've come a long way even since I've met you a couple months ago, and I remember then you told me you hadn't eaten for so long. I want pizza. Pizza? And I want a burger. I haven't had a burger yet. You want a burger? You forget how great it is to just actually be able to eat? Just to let it sit in your mouth, and taste it, you know? All those little things that we take for granted that you know, that you miss and you want back. Reporter: Back home, cam has been able to get other pieces of his old life back. Playing golf. Having a catch. He has even gone skydiving! As great as it is, he admits there are still tough days. Remember, this was once a suicidal young man. Do you still struggle with depression? Yeah. Occasionally, it's not a daily fight anymore, but yeah, there are still days when you know, I feel depressed. Reporter: But he says he knows to ask for help now when he needs it, whether that means at church or at home. I just want people to know that it can happen, you know? That if you're in the same kind of situation that I was in, there's people out there that can help you and will. You just have to reach out. What are your hopes for the future now, cam? That I can get back to work and you know, eventually I want a family and kids. You know, the American dream I guess. And now you really do have a full life ahead of you. Yes, I do.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Face transplant recipient thanks donor's mother: Part 6", "description": "In an emotional meeting, Sally Fisher got the chance to see her son's face on Cam Underwood after the transplant surgery.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/2020/video/face-transplant-recipient-donors-mother-part-59257358", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/2020/181116_2020_act6_1_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T07:01:32Z", "content": "Now Playing: The emotional moment face transplant recipient thanks his donor's mom Now Playing: Face transplant recipient has emotional meeting with donor's mother Now Playing: 26-year-old face transplant recipient: 'I see me': Part 1 Now Playing: Face transp\u2026 [+1348 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Face transplant recipient thanks donor's mother: Part 6\n\nReporter: Since getting a new face, cam Underwood has slowly but surely been getting used to being out and about.

But at a time when cord-cutting millennials and their parents alike are spending more time online, the party remains disproportionately committed to TV advertising, strategists say, a dynamic that could complicate those efforts.\n\n\"Who is watching broadcast television, who is watching Wheel of Fortune, who is watching Jeopardy? They are older, white and they tend to not be Democratic voters,\" said Tim Lim, who worked on the campaigns of former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and is now a fellow at Georgetown's Institute of Politics. \"By focusing so much on broadcast TV ads, we are missing crucial audiences to talk to.\"\n\nBut it's not just about how much is spent online; it's about how that money is spent.\n\nWhile Democrats have been wildly successful at using online advertising to rake in millions in donations and build email contact lists from their base, they've lagged behind Republicans when it comes to winning over new or on-the-fence voters in the digital space, operatives in both parties say.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee did not respond to a request for comment. However, there are signs that the party is making improvements.\n\nOne bright spot for Democrats was Priorities' $6.3-million digital effort that supported Senator-elect Kyrsten Sinema's win over GOP Rep. Martha McSally in Arizona, a red state that has shown signs of trending toward Democrats.\n\nThe goal was driving up overall turnout, with an additional focus on several key demographic groups, including Latinos and whites without a college degree. One set of slickly produced \"social pressure\" and motivational ads featured a diverse group of actors making the argument for why voting matters.\n\nAt the same time, a separate prong of the campaign was aimed at reducing support for a Green Party candidate who later dropped out and endorsed Sinema \u2014 a late-breaking development that was highlighted in online ads.\n\nAs evidence the campaign helped, Priorities noted in a memo provided to The Associated Press that turnout was up overall and Sinema performed better than Democrats in the recent past with the groups that were targeted.\n\n\"We have definitely closed the gap from the previous cycle, but it doesn't mean we're entirely there yet,\" said Cecil, whose group spent roughly $50 million overall on digital advertising during the midterms.\n\nThough Democrats are behind when it comes to online advertising, an aversion to big spending on digital is not entirely unique to them when compared to the corporate world. While hard numbers are difficult to come by, both parties tend to spend vastly less than is common among corporate advertising clients, where digital spending averages around 40 percent \u2014 more than what is normally spent on TV.\n\nIt's also hard to tell how the parties are spending their online advertising dollars because much of the publicly available data does not differentiate between ads geared toward fundraising and email list building versus ads aimed at winning over voters.\n\nStill, there are some broader trends that can be looked at.\n\nAfter being outspent by Republicans on Facebook in 2016, Democratic campaigns and aligned outside groups had outspent Republicans by more than a 2-to-1 margin on the platform as of last month, according to Facebook data compiled by Democratic digital advertising firm Bully Pulpit International.\n\n\"Facebook is the best platform for lead generation and digital fundraising, which explains why Democrats are using it to channel the outrage of their base into email addresses and donations,\" said Michael Duncan, a partner and digital strategist at the Republican firm Cavalry LLC. \"But when it comes to persuasion (of undecided voters), video overall \u2014 and Google specifically \u2014 are better platforms.\"\n\nThat's where Republicans have outspent Democrats.\n\nA late onslaught of digital spending by a slew of outside progressive groups during the closing weeks of the midterms narrowed Republicans' spending advantage on Google from 1.65-to-1 down to 1.18, according to data compiled by Bully Pulpit.\n\nBut Democrat's online spending figures are also skewed by the candidacy of Beto O'Rourke, a West Texas congressman who unsuccessfully challenged Sen. Ted Cruz. O'Rourke shattered records, raising more than $70 million. He spent more than $8 million on Facebook ads and $1.8 million on Google, according to disclosures by both companies.\n\nRepublicans say they used to be where Democrats are now. Then, after the GOP lost the 2012 presidential race, the Republican National Committee mandated that the party devote serious resources to digital advertising.\n\nNow they sit atop a sophisticated, data-driven digital enterprise that is updated in real time and can micro-target voters based on specific issues.\n\n\"We're getting to the point where digital has the scale of television with the targeting of direct mail,\" said Duncan, the Republican strategist. \"There are all sorts of ways you can slice and dice a voter file, match it to profiles online and serve ads.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Jeff Horwitz in Washington contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Mark Osborne", "title": "Fraternity suspended after member critically injured in fall", "description": "David Rusko was injured in a fall at the frat house on Nov. 10.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/sigma-alpha-epsilon-fraternity-suspended-member-critically-injured/story?id=59260696", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/sigma-alpha-epsilon-wvu2-wtae-mo-20181117_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T06:30:48Z", "content": "A student at West Virginia University is in critical condition after a fall at the school's Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity house -- leading to the suspension of the chapter pending an investigation.

Michael Walsh's family had waited over 100 years for this moment: the opportunity to honor their fallen hero.\n\nWalsh, an immigrant from Ireland, served with the American Expeditionary Forces in France through some of the bloodiest fighting of World War I. He would be one of the last men in his company killed during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive in the fall of 1918 in which more than 26,000 Americans died.\n\nIt was just three days before his company was pulled back from the front lines.\n\n\"His Irish luck had just run out,\" Walsh's great-niece Finola O'Mahony wrote in a letter about his life, provided to ABC News by the non-profit group Purple Hearts Reunited which tracks down lost or stolen medals and returns them to families.\n\nAfter Walsh's death, his family was never told details about what happened to him during the war. And although they did get a pension from the U.S. Army, they were never given the medals that Walsh so rightfully earned.\n\nWith the assistance of Purple Hearts Reunited, Walsh's nieces and nephews -- some now third generation -- gathered to receive his Purple Heart award in Glasnevin cemetery in Dublin on Friday. Though it was one of over 500 medals returned to veterans and their families in the organization's history, it was the first international reunification.\n\nFor Walsh's family, the ceremony concluded a long journey to better understand their loved one's life, especially his final year in the war.\n\nZachariah Fike/Purple Hearts Reunited\n\nAt the age of 22, Michael Walsh emigrated from rural Ireland, arriving at Ellis Island on September 3, 1911, \"in search of the American dream and a better life in New York,\" O'Mahony wrote.\n\nHe moved with other Irish immigrants to a four-story tenement house that faced the Second Avenue El train in midtown and found work in the newly rebuilt Grand Central Terminal as a platform man for the American Express freight agency.\n\n\"It was strenuous, but regular work. He earned union rates and sent money to his parents back home in Mayo [Ireland],\" O'Mahony said in the letter. \"Life was full of promise.\"\n\nZachariah Fike/Purple Hearts Reunited\n\nBut just six years after setting foot on American soil, the U.S. entered World War I, and Walsh was drafted in New York in June 1917 along with millions of other young men across the nation.\n\nHe would soon become one of the 2.7 million called up to serve as part of Gen. John J. Pershing's forces on the western front, reinforcing French and British allied troops.\n\n\"Michael was one of approx. 500,000 emigrants from 46 countries who served their new country to fight a war that was not of their making, and never part of their American dream,\" O'Mahony wrote.\n\nWith just three weeks of training, Walsh and 70,000 other new soldiers sailed to Saint-Nazaire, Brittany, in western France in June 1918.\n\nAccording to O'Mahony, Walsh's company sergeant said of his unit, \"There was not a man of the lot who knew enough about military life to do right-face properly.\" Though he would later say his troops \"progressed much better than was really expected of them.\"\n\nThe unit traveled by French box car trains to the villages of the Haute Marne in northeast France.\n\nO'Mahony quoted a local school teacher in Genevrieres who wrote in his journal that \"these soldiers are notable for their drive, their discipline, and their sense of fun.\"\n\nZachariah Fike/Purple Hearts Reunited\n\n\"Michael\u2019s last summer consisted of long night hikes, carrying their 40kg backpacks, and training in open battlefield fighting, in how to throw grenades, how to advance in assault waves, and how to quickly don their gas masks, to protect against the pervasive and deadly clouds of gas attacks,\" O'Mahony wrote.\n\nBy late September, the allied forces began their final push against the German troops, known as the Battle of the Meuse-Argonne. Walsh's unit was assigned to the 3rd battalion, 58th brigade, alongside the French 18th division. Their goal was to push back the enemy through rough terrain where they \"had all the best vantage points and would affect a vicious counterattack, prepared to fight man to man to hold their position,\" O'Mahony said.\n\nWalsh's unit took heavy casualties -- losing a third of its original strength by mid-October, according to their commanding officer. But Walsh would fight another few weeks. It was not until Oct. 24, 1918, when he was on the front lines during a push to capture an observation tower, that he was killed.\n\nThrough archive research, Walsh's family believes he was hit by shrapnel that day, most likely the last member of his company to die before the entire unit was pulled back from the front three days later.\n\nOn the 100th anniversary of Walsh's death, a group of his nieces and nephews traveled to the Meuse-Argonne American cemetery near Verdun, France.\n\nJean-Christophe Verhaegen/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"Nothing prepares us for the sight of over 14,000 pristine, white marble crosses, crisply standing to attention in death, as they had paraded in life,\" O'Mahoney wrote. \"Plot H, row 11, grave 9 and here it is, the final resting place of Private Michael Walsh, Co K, 116th Infantry, 29th Division, 100 years to the day he was killed in action.\"\n\nThe family retraced what they believed to be Walsh's path, across the field of the Molleville farm and into the woods of Consenvoye and the Grand Montagne.\n\n\"We saw machine gun nests, shell holes and corrugated German bunkers. Then we came across a large tin bucket, just sitting there where it had lain undisturbed for 100 years, riddled with bullet holes and with the side blown out, in a strange way, a small monument to the suffering of millions and to the grief of families like the Walshes,\" O'Mahoney said.\n\nThe Purple Heart ceremony in Dublin on Friday was another important part of honoring Walsh's legacy as an immigrant and a soldier.\n\nHis Purple Heart was the last of 100 medals returned over the last two years by Purple Hearts Reunited and the United States World War One Centennial Commission."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Santa Rosa police officer reunites with 87-year-old he saved in fire: Part 3", "description": "One year after Irene Lopez was rescued from her senior home, she gets to thank her hero, officer Andy Adams.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/santa-rosa-police-officer-reunites-87-year-saved-59260352", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Nightline/181117_ntl_santarosa_part3_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T06:18:19Z", "content": "Now Playing: New fire in California erupts overnight Now Playing: Number of missing in California fire skyrockets Now Playing: Santa Rosa police officer reunites with 87-year-old he saved in fire: Part 3 Now Playing: Residents return to Santa Rosa to rebuild \u2026 [+1323 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Santa Rosa police officer reunites with 87-year-old he saved in fire: Part 3\n\n??? ??????

Alive on its own, the kind you can't tuck away. Perhaps that was the feeling on this morning. October 9th, 2017. It's like a frickin' train coming through here. Reporter: When residents slowly returned to find what they once knew, now alien. It was hard to take in, it was hard to really grasp for a while. Reporter: This is what Jeff acrepki came home to, ruins where his house once stood. Not everyone suffered the same outcome. The fire dangled people between two fates. Look. Look at this. Wow. Reporter: Those who were spared -- Oh my gosh, we didn't get touched. Reporter: And those who lost everything. They weren't so lucky. No, they weren't. When you first laid sight on your house, or what was left of it, what went through your mind? I wanted to be sick. It's just all gone. Everything we've worked for. It's all gone. In the days after, you hear a lot of people say, at least everybody's safe, they're just things, it's just stuff. In your mind you're just like, you want to cuss them out because it's not just stuff. It's the memorial flag for my wife's father. She lost her dad in Iraq and that's all we have of him. My son's blankie. My son's favorite toy. Those aren't just things, those are remnants of our lives and other people's lives that we don't have anymore. Reporter: The fire killed 22 and laid waste to 3,000-plus residences, some the homes of first responders who worked tirelessly to evacuate others, like firefighter Paul Lowenthal. When it hit me, it was day five. Our fire chief, Tony gosner, and Jonathan cox, the chief of Cal fire, pulled me aside and said, you're done, you need a time-out, you need a break. I looked at him and said, what do you want me to do? I don't really have anything to go to. When you went home, what was that like? Not as hard as trying to explain to my daughter that our home was destroyed in the fire. She wanted to get back what she had before. I get it. But at the same time, it's an opportunity for us to start over, start a new chapter. Reporter: Charlie and date Higgins marked the start of their new chapter by hanging this symbol, one that for them meant perseverance. I'm coming back. Coming back. Reporter: In the days that followed, the cleanup began. A couple things. Reporter: The most commonplace items now personal treasures. This is our house number from our house. Oh my gosh. It looks literally like a surreal piece of artwork. Oh, yeah. Oh yeah. That is just how we found it. Reporter: As time passed, so many in Santa Rosa were still displaced, still mourning, and longing to be home for the holidays. That was the only place I felt that I belonged. Reporter: Her friend Ronnie wanted her to know she still did. One night we drove over there. There's Ronnie. And he put a big 15-foot Christmas tree on my lawn. Reporter: As more trees were trimmed, the sound of caroling echoed through the streets. ??? Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer ??? Reporter: A simple truth discovered -- that home is in the heart. With the new year, new hope. This is the living room. Yeah. Our fireplace will go there. Reporter: Nancy proudly shows us the makings of her new home. This is one of the bedrooms. This is the master bath. Reporter: She's hoping to move back in by the end of this year. As is Kate Higgins. Every time we come, there's a little more done. It means we're a little closer to being back home. Feels like a little piece of you is being put back together. Reporter: Roughly 27% of the homes lost are now under construction, or have completely rebuilt. People don't understand why we're letting people rebuild back in those areas that have burned. The reality is a lot of those homes were older homes, built before the standards went into effect. The idea is now that that construction will protect those homes. Through the construction, with the fuel reduction, it will make those homes successful in surviving a wildfire. Reporter: So many in Santa Rosa live in constant fear that disaster could strike again. Climate science has found that longer, drier periods have created tinder box conditions that when sparked and mixed with coastal winds are leading to high-speed infernos. Like the one we saw earlier this week that destroyed the city of paradise, California. We're seeing them time and time again. It's definitely becoming the new norm. Reporter: Now perhaps the community of paradise, just hours away, will look to Santa Rosa for lessons in their own recovery. The only good thing that's come out of this disaster is the neighborhood coming together. We're stronger together now than we were a year ago. Reporter: On this night, the first anniversary of the fire -- I want to invite you to stand here together in community. Reporter: Close to 500 people park. You can burn our neighborhood to the ground but you can't take our community spirit. What you're finding is the strength, the hope, the love, the life. It's back. Reporter: A community that stands firm in its resolve, that loneliness will roam no longer.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: 'Everything we've worked for.. gone': Santa Rosa remembers fire one year later:Part 1", "description": "One year after the Tubbs fire tore through the Santa Rosa community, residents and first responders look back on the night whole neighborhoods were reduced to ash and 22 people died in the blaze.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/worked-santa-rosa-remembers-fire-year-laterpart-59260350", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Nightline/181117_ntl_santarosa_part1_2_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T06:16:09Z", "content": "Now Playing: New fire in California erupts overnight Now Playing: Number of missing in California fire skyrockets Now Playing: Santa Rosa police officer reunites with 87-year-old he saved in fire: Part 3 Now Playing: Residents return to Santa Rosa to rebuild \u2026 [+1323 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for 'Everything we've worked for.. gone': Santa Rosa remembers fire one year later:Part 1\n\nThis has been one of the most difficult years we've ever had.

Everything we've worked for, it's all gone. Reporter: Memory is all that remains from that night in October 2017. When a raging wildfire passed over the rolling hills of wine country and overtook the quiet suburb of Santa Rosa. We have multiple structures involved. I just knew the house was going to be gone within 15 minutes. Oh my god. You have to go southbound, get out of here, go. I have a 9-year-old! Definitely not something I think I'd ever experience in the city of Santa Rosa. Reporter: For some it came with no warning and dealt a vicious hand. Charcoal the size of heads, cinders just falling. Reporter: In its wake, utter devastation. Whole neighborhoods reduced to ash. Now, one year later, Santa Rosa's residents are still grappling with how they suffered through until this week, the most destructive wildfire in California history. Looking at what went ws they rebuild from the ground up to try to ensure the disaster of this magnitude will never strike home again. Nobody's prepared. Not for what happened the way it happened. Nobody's prepared. Reporter: October 8th, 2017. Started off as a warm, dry, and breezy Sunday. What are known as the diablo winds are picking up steam as they move through the city. Veteran firefighter Paul Lowenthal notices the winds, but his mind is diverted instead to the monotonous rhythms of fatherhood. My daughter and I were in Hawaii for the week. Kind of setting in, trying to get back into a Normal routine. Getting ready to start a school and a workweek. Reporter: But that night, around 11:00 P.M., he gets a call from work. Started seeing glows in the distance. Eventually hit a wall of fire. Literally fire on both sides of the road, blowing across. There was no way to get through it. That's when I knew this was not coming to Santa Rosa, this was here. What's going through the pit of your stomach? We've got to get people out, we've got to get them out now. Reporter: It's the middle of the night and most of the city is asleep. Paul calls the Santa Rosa police department for help. They're going to start moving us into the creek and farm area -- Those police officers just dove in without asking questions, and immediately started going door to door and getting people out of harm's way. Police! Reporter: With body cameras rolling, police officers are deployed to areas where they think the fire is going. But the wind has a mind of its own. The wind pushes the fire farther than first responders had anticipated, leaving some residents in the neighborhood of Coffey park unaware of what's headed their way. I can actually feel the heat. It was the loudest wind I've ever heard in my life. It was -- it was like a -- just a barreling sound of nonstop wind. It was like a blow torch. The lights started to flicker. Okay, let's just get water and candles together, put them on the table. I went to the front door and see it's really windy and smoky and ash was flying. Then within less than five seconds, I looked back, and it was a wall of red. What's going through your mind? We've got to go. One of our neighborhoods walked to a viewpoint up the 101. She came running around the corner and said, it's hopped the 101, get out, get out. It hopped the 101 means it hopped a six-lane freeway? Yeah. Now it's on your side? Yeah. We didn't say anything to your neighbors, like go get your neighbors, or talk to you soon. We just ran back into our houses, grab the dogs, grab some clothes, we grabbed some of our son's stuff, put it in a duffel bag. Get in my car, turn the corner, and there's somebody's lawn on fire. I see flames coming up over the rooftops. That's when it registered with me, this is bad, this is real bad. There was ash and embers coming down as we're getting in the car. Literally fire raining down. You're fleeing for your lives? Yeah. I had a hose, I couldn't have saved my house. Just the ferociousness of the winds and the embers from that field and everything else, blowing across. Reporter: In another area of Coffey park, officers reach the home of Nancy and Ken mizoni. Hello! What's your plan? Just in here with a hose. Yeah, you're going to fight it out? I'm going to fight it out. You sure? Yes. Anybody else here with you? Me and my wife. Do you want me to get your wife out of here? No, she's all right. It's chaos, where are we going to go? We can get her where she needs to go. Reporter: This is Ken's wife Nancy. Her husband's having a hard time talking about that night, and she struggles to do so too. Ken seemed pretty adamant that he was going to stay. We were staying. We were staying. Fire department had to be -- they had to be coming. They've got this. It's just a matter of, we're going to help them out, you know. Reporter: What Nancy and her husband didn't know at the time was that the fire was already destroying the area around them. It just hadn't reached their home yet. Sir, you're going to put a lot of people in danger. The fire is a couple of houses over, it's coming at us. It's huge. Please. We need to get you out of here. Please get in the car and leave. You have two officers here now -- Where should I go? That way. That way. Just get out of here. It is one field away. Like right now. I'm leaving now because I've got to save myself and save other people. You could hear the urgency in the police officers' voice. Ken didn't want to hear it? Didn't want to believe it, couldn't grasp it. We were in shock. Reporter: Not long after the officers leave, terror sets in. I remember jumping down and I had the hose. And Ken said, quick, we got to go, we got to go, we're going to come right back. And when I ran -- when I got to the front of the house where the fire -- it was 30-foot flames across the street from us. All you saw was fire. Reporter: With only seconds to spare, Nancy and Ken joined the multitude of others fleeing for their lives. Fire! Reporter: But some are finding themselves stranded, like Mario Montes. A police officer knocked on the door and I told him, well, I can't evacuate, I have five ladies with me in the house, I need help. Reporter: He is the sole caretaker on duty at the assisted living center. He immediately begins helping police officers with the evacuation. I had -- I ran with me taking Irene out. Reporter: Mario passes 87-year-old Irene Lopes to officered on damns who wheels her out of the house and struggles to load her in the back of his car. I cannot walk! Okay, I'll help you. Reporter: Embers are raining down upon them. The fire is right there. I can't, my feet -- I was putting her in a lot of pain, helping her get into the car. Please help me! Ai-yi-yi, my legs! I'm sorry, you've got to sit up. Okay. Reporter: Once the cars are loaded up, the officers make their escape. Let's get out of here. I got it, I got it. Let her in. Reporter: And safely drive the women to an evacuation center. 2 inches from the ground.

Perhaps.\n\nVance Joseph and Case Keenum in Denver? Possibly.\n\nJohn Harbaugh and Joe Flacco? Could be.\n\nThen again, each of those coaches could keep their jobs and have new QBs in 2019. And we know Jon Gruden isn't going anywhere in Oakland, though Derek Carr might head elsewhere.\n\nNor is Pat Shurmur, despite a discouraging first year in the Jersey Meadowlands, likely to leave the Big Apple. But the status of a 37-year-old Eli Manning is in more doubt.\n\nIt would be a surprise to see Adam Gase out in Miami. Considering how much he has been out of the lineup in his seven-year career, it would not be a stunner to see Ryan Tannehill depart the Dolphins.\n\nLet's take a look:\n\nNEW YORK\n\nManning is not a washed-up has-been. His arm remains strong, his knowledge of the game is irreplaceable and he has three enviable options in Odell Beckham Jr., Saquon Barkley and Evan Engram.\n\nWhat he doesn't have is anyone who can block with any regularity. Manning is about as mobile as Shurmur, maybe less so, and when he doesn't get the necessary time to set himself, he's not likely to find a comfortable place to throw.\n\nYes, it's time for the Giants to look for a replacement, but not necessarily someone to take over next year. How about finally improving perhaps the worst offensive line in the league and seeing what Manning can do behind it?\n\nOtherwise, Carr could wind up an option as Gruden keeps wheeling and dealing.\n\nDENVER\n\nKeenum has another year to go on the deal he parlayed his best career season (in Minnesota) to get with QB-desperate Denver. Cutting him will cost a $10 million cap hit, so unless John Elway can work a trade for that prohibitive contract, Keenum figures to be back with the Broncos.\n\nThe cupboard is bare behind him, especially after Chad Kelly got himself arrested and then released. Plus, Keenum once again has had to learn a new offense, and he's had some knee issues.\n\nElway could be enticed to add a veteran who has won a Super Bowl, as he did with Peyton Manning (did someone say Flacco?), but only if he can deal Keenum.\n\nBALTIMORE\n\nFlacco, who's had a better (but not great) season than in recent years, is bothered by a hip injury. And his eventual replacement, Lamar Jackson, was chosen in the first round of April's draft.\n\nThe massive contract Flacco earned after winning the 2012 championship as Super Bowl MVP was extended in 2016 and he is signed through 2021. But the Ravens can open up $10.5 million in salary cap space by releasing Flacco, 33, after the season, with a potential savings of $18.5 million if they designate him as cut after June 1, which would damage his value elsewhere.\n\nHe won't command the same kind of money on the open market, but he will command attention for his strong arm, solid leadership, willingness to play hurt, and, well, a pedigree that rarely reaches free agency with a few good years left.\n\nGase in Miami certainly would like a QB who can get on the field regularly.\n\nMIAMI\n\nBrock Osweiler is the 19th starter since Dan Marino ended his Hall of Fame career. None has been a star, though Chad Pennington could have been had his shoulder not been so brittle.\n\nGase would seem to be tied to Tannehill, who has played in five games this year, none last season, because of injuries. When healthy, Tannehill helped get the Dolphins to the playoffs as a wild card in 2016, Gase's first year in Miami. Then he was hurt for the postseason.\n\nGase has been something of a QB guru in other stops, so a young guy who can stay in the lineup might be appealing. Or maybe a 20-something needing a change of scenery such as Jameis Winston or Bortles.\n\nTAMPA BAY\n\nPerhaps the most puzzling case of all because Winston, the top pick in the 2015 draft, should be a slam dunk as the future. He isn't.\n\nWinston is due $20.9 million next season, the final year of his rookie deal. That's way more than he is worth, and though the Bucs picked up his fifth-year option, they could release him in '19 and not owe him anything; 2019 is guaranteed only in case of injury, which is why some speculate Winston may not play again this year.\n\nHe comes with lots of talent, but still lacks maturity. He has had off-field issues and was suspended for the first three games this season.\n\nDo the Bucs want to start over at the position, knowing Winston's potential remains sky high?\n\nJACKSONVILLE\n\nConvinced after coming oh-so-close to making the Super Bowl that Bortles could be their franchise guy, the Jaguars signed him to a three-year, $54 million contract that includes a $16 million salary in 2019. So there would be $16.5 million in dead money if he is cut.\n\nAnd, like Keenum, the numbers for a trade likely are prohibitive.\n\nBut folks in Jacksonville believe, despite the current 3-6 mark, that the Jags are built to win soon. Maybe not with the struggling Bortles, however.\n\nThis history team boss Tom Coughlin has with Manning adds some intrigue, but a move for a veteran to replace Bortles might target someone younger and more mobile.\n\nOAKLAND\n\nGruden has publicly backed Carr, but it's difficult to gauge if that support is strong or even real. Given his maneuvers to redo the Raiders, it appears with Gruden no one is safe.\n\nGruden would love to find a Rich Gannon clone, maybe a Flacco or even a Nick Foles. And cutting Carr would create only $7.5 million in dead money, hardly prohibitive.\n\nThen again, Gruden has three first-round selections in the 2019 draft. Using one on a quarterback makes a lot of sense.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Josh Dubow and Arnie Stapleton, and Sports Writers Tom Canavan, Steven Wine, Mark Long, Fred Goodall and David Ginsburg contributed.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP\u2014NFL"}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Argentina: Submarine found sunk year after disappearing", "description": "Argentina's navy has announced that searchers have found the missing submarine ARA San Juan deep in the Atlantic a year after it disappeared with 44 crewmen aboard", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/argentina-submarine-found-sunk-year-disappearing-59259965", "urlToImage": null, "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T04:47:50Z", "content": "Argentina's navy announced early Saturday that searchers found the missing submarine ARA San Juan deep in the Atlantic a year after it disappeared with 44 crewmen aboard.

The company, commissioned by the Argentine government, began searching for the missing vessel Sept. 7.\n\nIt remained unclear what the next steps could be.\n\nIn a statement to The Associated Press, Ocean Infinity CEO Oliver Plunkett said authorities would have to determine how to advance. \"We would be pleased to assist with a recovery operation but at the moment are focused on completing imaging of the debris field,\" he said.\n\nNavy commander Jose Luis Villan urged \"prudence,\" saying that a federal judge was overseeing the investigation and would be the one to decide whether it was possible to recover a part or the entirety of the ship.\n\nWithout adequate technological capabilities, however, Argentina would likely need to seek assistance from foreign countries or pay Ocean Infinity or another company, potentially complicating its recent commitment to austerity. Argentina is currently facing a currency crisis and double-digit inflation that has led the government to announce sweeping measures to balance the budget and concretize a financing deal with the International Monetary Fund.\n\nAny move to recuperate the vessel would also be a logistically large and challenging undertaking based on the submarine's distance from the coast, its depth, and the kind of seabed upon which it is resting.\n\nRelatives of crew members were determined to fight for it to be quickly surfaced.\n\nIsabel Vilca, the half sister of crewman Daniel Alejandro Polo, told the AP that the discovery was just the beginning.\n\nShe said families need to recover the remains of their loved ones to know what happened and help prevent similar tragedies.\n\n\"We do know they can get it out because Ocean Infinity told us they can, that they have equipment,\" said Luis Antonio Niz, father of crew member Luis Niz. \"If they sent him off, I want them to bring him back to me.\"\n\nThe sub's discovery was announced just two days after families of the missing sailors held a one-year commemoration for its disappearance on Nov. 15, 2017. The San Juan was returning to its base in the coastal city of Mar del Plata when contact was lost.\n\nOn the anniversary Thursday, Argentina President Mauricio Macri said the families of the submariners should not feel alone and delivered an \"absolute and non-negotiable commitment\" to find \"the truth.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Aguad said that the vessel was found to be in an area that investigators had deemed \"most likely.\"\n\nOfficials showed images of the submarine, which was located on a seabed with its hull totally deformed. Parts of its propellers were buried and debris was scattered up to 70 meters (230 feet) away.\n\nThe German-built diesel-electric TR-1700 class submarine was commissioned in the mid-1980s and was most recently refitted between 2008 and 2014. During the $12 million retrofitting, the vessel was cut in half and had its engines and batteries replaced. Experts said refits can be difficult because they involve integrating systems produced by different manufacturers, and even the tiniest mistake during the cutting phase can put the safety of the ship and crew at risk.\n\nThe navy said previously the captain reported on Nov. 15, 2017, that water entered the snorkel and caused one of the sub's batteries to short-circuit. The captain later communicated that it had been contained.\n\nSome hours later, an explosion was detected near the time and place where the San Juan was last heard from. The navy said the blast could have been caused by a \"concentration of hydrogen\" triggered by the battery problem reported by the captain.\n\nMacri promised a full investigation after the submarine was lost. Federal police raided naval bases and other buildings last January as part of the probe, soon after the government dismissed the head of the navy.\n\nArgentina gave up hope of finding survivors after an intense search aided by 18 countries, but a few navy units have continued providing logistical support to Ocean Infinity.\n\nOn Saturday, Plunkett tweeted: \"Our thoughts are with the many families affected by this terrible tragedy. We sincerely hope that locating the resting place of the ARA San Juan will be of some comfort to them at what must be a profoundly difficult time.\"\n\nHe also said: \"This was an extremely challenging project and today's successful outcome, following the earlier search operations, firmly endorses our technology.\"\n\nThe company unsuccessfully searched for the Malaysia Airlines plane that disappeared in 2014 over the Indian Ocean.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Ocean Infinity is an American company, not ship.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Paul Byrne contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "The Latest: Pence meets Taiwan's delegation at APEC summit", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

But there's some things that I'm hoping will allow us to be a little bit less somber. We'd like to get Paramount Ranch rebuilt in the next 24 months.\"\n\nA church built for HBO's \"Westworld\" and a train depot constructed for the 1990s CBS series \"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,\" the two productions most associated with the site, are all that remain of the structures, backed by the blackened hills of a wildfire that many feared for years.\n\n\"We've all dreaded it, we've tried to prepare, but sometimes the wind just takes over,\" said Rory Skei, the chief deputy executive officer of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. \"We do what we can do.\"\n\nElsewhere on the fire, more residents were allowed Friday to return to homes they fled from days earlier.\n\nAuthorities reopened more areas in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. But they kept some locations within the Woolsey Fire zone off-limits because of hazards ranging from burned power poles to compromised gas lines and destroyed roadways.\n\nUtility crews worked to remove damaged equipment and bring in replacements, including numerous power poles.\n\nAlthough walls of flame and towering columns of smoke were gone, firefighters continue to expand containment lines around the scorched area. Fire commanders said the 153-square-mile (396-square-kilometer) burn area was 78 percent surrounded.\n\nThe count of destroyed structures reached 713. Another 201 structures were damaged.\n\nLos Angeles County sheriff's detectives were investigating three deaths. Two adults were found in a gutted car last week, and the remains of a person were found Wednesday in the rubble of a home that had burned to the ground.\n\nAt the Paramount Ranch, structures that served as barns, hotels, saloons and barbershops for decades of movies and TV shows are gone. Workers will salvage what they can and then work to rebuild.\n\nThe site began as a set for Paramount Pictures in the 1920s and was taken over by the National Park Service in 1980. It got a major restoration in 1985, with the park service trying to maintain as much as it could from the original buildings. Corrugated tin roofs on many of them still dated to the 1920s. Now those roofs lie burned and twisted on the ground like pieces of a crashed plane.\n\nWestern Town specifically was built for TV productions in the 1950s and was used for such westerns as \"The Cisco Kid\" and \"Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre.\"\n\nBut the site lent itself to productions of all kinds.\n\n\"American Sniper,\" the 2014 film starring Bradley Cooper, was also partly filmed there, as was 2006's \"The Lake House,\" starring Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves.\n\n\"It could be adapted for anything,\" Szymanski said.\n\nIt remained to be seen how much the ranch being out of commission would affect Hollywood productions.\n\nHBO did not immediately answer questions about whether the fire would affect the upcoming season 3 of \"Westworld,\" or whether production was planned for the ranch at all. The network previously expressed concern for \"all those affected by these horrible fires.\"\n\nAs the ranch's manmade structures are rebuilt, the stark surrounding hills will most likely take care of themselves.\n\n\"All this natural vegetation will regenerate itself,\" said Sara Horner, board president of the Santa Monica Mountains Fund. \"A year from now, it will be green, from after the rains, and then in a few years, it'll look pretty much as it did.

Trump said, \"Maybe it contributes a little bit. The big problem we have is management.\"\n\nIn an interview scheduled to air Sunday, Trump added, \"You need management,\" and then said, \"I'm not saying that in a negative way, a positive \u2014 I'm just saying the facts.\"\n\nIt echoes Trump's tweet a week ago, in which he threatened to withhold federal payments to California and claimed its forest management is \"so poor.\"\n\nTrump is scheduled to visit the devastated Northern California town of Paradise on Saturday. A fire there has killed at least 63 people in the country's deadliest wildfire in a century.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n12:45 p.m.\n\nSan Francisco International Airport says nearly 200 flights have been delayed because of low visibility and smoke caused by wildfires in Northern California.\n\nAirport spokesman Doug Yakel said that as of noon on Friday about 15 percent, or 195 flights, have had delays averaging 45 minutes.\n\nOn Thursday, about 500 were delayed, representing about 40 percent of the airport's flights. The airport averages about 1,250 flights per day.\n\nYakel said smoke was the main factor in low visibility conditions, with visibility at about 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) Friday compared to 10 miles (16 kilometers) on a normal day.\n\nThe airport is urging travelers to check with their airlines or the airport's website for their flights' status.\n\nSchools across the San Francisco Bay Area were closed Friday as winds carried smoke from wildfires in Northern California that blanketed towns and cities hundreds of miles (kilometers) away.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n12:15 p.m.\n\nAuthorities say it is hard to get a handle on the number of missing in the aftermath of Northern California wildfire that is the deadliest in the country in at least a century.\n\nThe number has fluctuated from day to day, with the latest report standing at more than 600 unaccounted for. Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea acknowledged the list is \"dynamic\" and includes reports from the disaster's frantic early hours.\n\nSome who are on the ever-evolving list have been confirmed as deceased by family and friends on social media. Others have been located safely, but authorities have not yet marked them as found.\n\nIn last year's Northern California wine country wildfires, Sonoma County authorities at one point listed more than 2,000 people as missing. But they slowly whittled down the number.\n\nIn the end, 44 people died in a that series of fires in several counties.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n10:30 a.m.\n\nHundreds of people displaced by the Northern California wildfire have lined up outside a mall in the city of Chico where the Federal Emergency Management Agency set up an assistance center inside what used to be a Sears department store.\n\nAlso assisting residents of the area destroyed by the fire were California's Office of Emergency Services and its Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nCarol Manzo lost her mobile home in the town of Paradise and stood in line with her daughter in law and three grandchildren.\n\nShe's says she hopes to ask FEMA workers about lodging for her family.\n\nThey stayed in a hotel through Wednesday and can stay with a family friend in the city of Chico through Thanksgiving, but then have nowhere to go.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n10 a.m.\n\nShares of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. have soared after California's top utility regulator said his agency will help the company deal with potentially crippling liability costs from wildfires.\n\nStock prices soared 36 percent in midday trading Friday after plunging 60 percent and losing $15 billion in valuation in the week following the outbreak of a Northern California wildfire that is the nation's deadliest in a century.\n\nNo cause has been determined, but speculation has centered on PG&E, which reported an outage around the time and place the fire ignited.\n\nLate Thursday, California Public Utilities Commission President Michael Picker sought to calm financial markets by indicating support for the continued viability of PG&E and other publicly traded utilities.\n\nIn an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Picker said his agency will soon implement a provision in a new state law that allows utilities to pass costs for past wildfires to their customers. He said additional legislation may be needed to ensure that provision applies to this year's fires.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n9:10 a.m.\n\nAuthorities have so far counted 616 structures were destroyed and 183 damaged by the deadly Southern California fire.\n\nThe latest numbers issued Friday morning reflect damage assessments in 57 percent of the burned area.\n\nContainment of the fire has also increased to 69 percent of the fire zone encompassing 153 square miles (396 square kilometers) of suburbs and wilderness west of Los Angeles.\n\nFirefighters could be helped by onshore flows of moist air from the Pacific, with some gusts up to 20 mph (32 kph) in the afternoon and increased humidity levels.\n\nFirefighters are monitoring unburned islands of vegetation and crews are working to restore utilities.\n\nRepopulation of evacuated areas is continuing but authorities say some areas remain off-limits due to hazards ranging from burned power poles to compromised gas lines and destroyed roadways.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n8:10 a.m.\n\nOfficials say they have contained almost half of a Northern California deadly blaze that razed a town and killed at least 63 people.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said Friday the wildfire that destroyed the town of Paradise is now 45 percent contained, up from 40 percent Thursday morning.\n\nThe department says the blaze has charred 222 square miles (575 square kilometers), destroyed 144 apartment buildings and 9,700 homes.\n\nButte County Sheriff's Kory Honea told reporters Thursday night that 630 people are on a missing list.\n\nHe said many may be safe, but that he's making the list public so people can let officials know they're safe.\n\nMore than 450 people are combing through debris in the search for human remains.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n7:45 a.m.\n\nForecasters are predicting rain early next week for the Northern California area where a deadly blaze that decimated a town continues to burn a week after it started.\n\nThe wet weather could help firefighters extinguish the massive blaze earlier than expected.\n\nBut officials say rain could also complicate the efforts of dozens of teams who are sifting through ash and debris, looking for human remains.\n\nThe National Weather Service said Friday that the northeast corner of California, where the town of Paradise is located, will get rain starting Tuesday night.\n\nButte County Sheriff Kory Honea said Thursday he brought in dozens of search teams to search for remains \"as expeditiously as possible.\"\n\nAt least 63 people were killed after the fire swept through Paradise and other communities on Nov. 8\n\nHonea's office Thursday published a missing list with 631 names that probably includes names of people who fled the blaze and don't know they are being sought.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n12 a.m.\n\nFire officials in Northern California say the list of 631 people missing in the nation's deadliest wildfire in a century probably includes people who fled the blaze and don't know they're being sought.\n\nButte County Sheriff Kory Honea says he's making that list public so that people can let authorities know they're safe. Meanwhile, 63 people are confirmed dead and some 52,000 are displaced in shelters, motels and the homes of friends and relatives.\n\nOthers are at a Walmart parking lot and an adjacent field in Chico, a dozen miles away from the ashes.\n\nAt the vast shelter parking lot, evacuees from California's deadliest fire wonder if they still have homes, if their neighbors are still alive \u2014 and where they will go when their place of refuge shuts down in a matter of days.\n\nThe Northern California fire that began a week earlier obliterated the town of Paradise . Searchers have pulled bodies from incinerated homes and cremated cars. But in many cases, the victims may have been reduced to bits of bones and ash."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "China's Xi: World faces choice of confrontation, cooperation", "description": "China's president says the world faces a choice of cooperation or confrontation in a speech to a summit of leaders that is divided by tensions stemming from increased U.S. protectionism", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/chinas-xi-world-faces-choice-confrontation-cooperation-59257592", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_b85c009d667749878366be6b215cb773_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T02:27:34Z", "content": "China's president says the world faces a choice of cooperation or confrontation in a speech to a summit of leaders that is divided by tensions stemming from increased U.S. protectionism.

Friedman granted John Hinckley Jr. the largest measure of freedom he's had since shooting and wounding Reagan and three others outside a Washington hotel in 1981.\n\nHinckley was confined for decades to St. Elizabeths Hospital in the nation's capital. Starting in 2006, he began to make trips to visit his mother, who is now in her 90s and lives in a gated community in Williamsburg. He moved in with her in 2016.\n\nThe judge wrote Friday that the 63-year-old Hinckley can now live within 75 miles of that city as long as Hinckley's doctors give their approval on the location.\n\nHinckley still must live under a long list of conditions. They include meeting at least twice a month with a social worker, a psychiatrist and a therapist. He can't own a gun or consume alcohol or drugs.\n\nHe's also barred from contacting his victims' families or traveling anywhere where there are former or current U.S. presidents, vice presidents and members of Congress. He must carry a GPS-enabled cellphone when he's away from home.\n\nFriedman, who is a judge in the District of Columbia, wrote that a forensic psychologist and a forensic psychiatrist supported the changes to the conditions of Hinckley's release.\n\nFriedman also wrote that \"this court finds that Mr. Hinckley will not pose a danger to himself or others if he is permitted to continue residing full-time in Williamsburg, Virginia, on convalescent leave under the proposed conditions.\"\n\nIt's possible that Hinckley could be granted even more independence in the future. His attorney, Barry Levine, said he'll request unconditional release for Hinckley. The next court date is scheduled for June.\n\n\"It would be the complete restoration to life as you and I know it,\" Levine said during an interview on Friday.\n\n\"Would he continue to see mental health professionals? Of course. He doesn't mind that. Those people have been wonderful to him,\" Levine added.\n\n\"If we wanted to go Paris, he could do it. He could do whatever you could do,\" Levine added. \"His compliance with the court over the many years has been unfailingly flawless. And if people knew him, they would like him.\"\n\nHinckley was 25 when he shot Reagan in March 1981. The shooting also paralyzed press secretary James Brady and injured two others. Hinckley was suffering from acute psychosis and major depression and had become obsessed with the actress Jodie Foster.\n\nWhen jurors found him not guilty by reason of insanity, they said he needed treatment, not a lifetime in confinement.\n\nAt court hearings in recent years, doctors have testified that Hinckley's psychosis and major depression have been in remission for decades and that, while he still has a narcissistic personality disorder, its effects have diminished.\n\nThe home of Hinckley's mother is on the 13th hole of a golf course. His room has a king-size bed and TV and is decorated with paintings he has done of houses and cats, according to court documents.\n\nHinckley's attorney said he volunteers, which the court requires. He also interacts with people in the area, visiting record stores and taking guitar lessons.\n\nIn 2015, Cabot Wade, a musician who gave Hinckley guitar lessons, said he never felt Hinckley was violent or dangerous.\n\nNevertheless, he said then that \"nobody will touch him with a 10-foot pole.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Retailers ramping up deals as Black Friday rush draws closer", "description": "Experts suggested following brands on social media, where they often unveil special deals and promo codes for the holidays.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/retailers-ramping-deals-black-friday-rush-draws-closer-59257512", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/WNT/181116_wn_jarvis_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T02:01:23Z", "content": "Now Playing: Black Friday ads released early Now Playing: Milwaukee residents camp out for brewery's specialty Black Friday beers Now Playing: Retailers ramping up deals as Black Friday rush draws closer Now Playing: Going cash-free is making more sense for c\u2026 [+1184 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Retailers ramping up deals as Black Friday rush draws closer\n\nNow when you go out, you cash in.

Add Interest\n\nThe conclusion will bolster efforts in Congress to further punish the close U.S. ally for the killing. The Trump administration this week sanctioned 17 Saudi officials for their alleged role in the killing, but lawmakers have called on the administration to curtail arms sales to Saudi Arabia or take other harsher punitive measures.\n\nThe U.S. official familiar with the intelligence agencies' conclusion was unauthorized to speak publicly about it and spoke on condition of anonymity. It was first reported by The Washington Post.\n\nNiganned al-Shaikh/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nSaudi Arabia's top diplomat has said the crown prince had \"absolutely\" nothing to do with the killing.\n\nKhashoggi, a Saudi who lived in the United States, was a columnist for the Post and often criticized the royal family. He was killed Oct. 2 at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Turkish and Saudi authorities say he was killed inside the consulate by a team from the kingdom after he went there to get marriage documents.\n\nThis week, U.S. intelligence officials briefed members of the Senate and House intelligence committees and the Treasury Department announced economic sanctions on 17 Saudi officials suspected of being responsible for or complicit in the killing.\n\nAmong those targeted for sanctions were Mohammed al-Otaibi, the diplomat in charge of the consulate, and Maher Mutreb, who was part of the crown prince's entourage on trips abroad.\n\nThe sanctions freeze any assets the 17 may have in the U.S. and prohibit any Americans from doing business with them.\n\nAlso this week, the top prosecutor in Saudi Arabia announced he will seek the death penalty against five men suspected in the killing. The prosecutor's announcement sought to quiet the global outcry over Khashoggi's death and distance the killers and their operation from the kingdom's leadership, primarily the crown prince.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has called the killing a botched operation that was carried out very poorly and has said \"the cover-up was one of the worst cover-ups in the history of cover-ups.\"\n\nBut he has resisted calls to cut off arms sales to the kingdom and has been reluctant to antagonize the Saudi rulers. Trump considers the Saudis vital allies in his Mideast agenda.\n\nThe Post, citing unnamed sources, also reported that U.S. intelligence agencies reviewed a phone call that the prince's brother, Khalid bin Salman, had with Khashoggi. The newspaper said the prince's brother, who is the current Saudi ambassador to the United States, told Khashoggi he would be safe in going to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to retrieve the documents he needed to get married.\n\nThe newspaper said it was not known whether the ambassador knew Khashoggi would be killed. But it said he made the call at the direction the crown prince, and the call was intercepted by U.S. intelligence.\n\nFatimah Baeshen, a spokesperson for the Saudi embassy in Washington, said that claim was false.\n\nShe said in a statement issued to The Associated Press that the ambassador met Khashoggi in person once in late September 2017. After that, they communicated via text messages, she said. The last text message the ambassador sent to Khashoggi was on Oct. 26, 2017, she said.\n\nBaeshen said the ambassador did not discuss with Khashoggi \"anything related to going to Turkey.\"\n\n\"Ambassador Prince Khalid bin Salman has never had any phone conversations with him,\" she said.\n\n\"You are welcome to check the phone records and cell phone content to corroborate this \u2014 in which case, you would have to request it from Turkish authorities,\" Baeshen said, adding that Saudi prosecutors have checked the phone records numerous times to no avail.\n\nThe ambassador himself tweeted: \"The last contact I had with Mr. Khashoggi was via text on Oct. 26, 2017. I never talked to him by phone and certainly never suggested he go to Turkey for any reason. I ask the U.S. government to release any information regarding this claim.\""}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "Matt McGarry and Engin Bas", "title": "Alleged Khashoggi killers discussed plot minutes before he arrived: Turkish officials", "description": "Saudi officials continue to claim the murder wasn't sanctioned.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/alleged-khashoggi-killers-discussed-plot-minutes-arrived-turkish/story?id=59257354", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/jamal-kashoggi-gty-jc-181112_hpMain_2_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T01:50:15Z", "content": "The team of alleged assassins sent to murder Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi discussed their plan to kill the writer while he was making his way to Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul, a high-level Turkish official familiar with the investigation t\u2026 [+6256 chars]", "fulltext": "The team of alleged assassins sent to murder Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi discussed their plan to kill the writer while he was making his way to Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul, a high-level Turkish official familiar with the investigation told ABC News.\n\nThe exchange, captured on recordings of Khashoggi\u2019s killing and the moments leading up to it, are part of the focus of Turkish investigators, the official said.\n\nThe extended recording allegedly includes a conversation among the assassination team about their plan just 15 minutes before Khashoggi arrived at the consulate, the senior official said. The recordings contain conversations between the alleged killers, discussing in detail how they would attack and then murder Khashoggi, the senior official added.\n\nThe purported recording would disprove claims by Saudi Arabia that Khashoggi was killed after a botched kidnapping. On Thursday, Saudi officials offered yet another version of events, saying Khashoggi\u2019s killing was a spur of the moment decision by the team.\n\n\u201cSometimes mistakes happen,\u201d the Saudi Foreign Minister told reporters.\n\nHasan Jamali/AP, FILE\n\nIn addition to audio from inside the Saudi consulate, the senior Turkish official told ABC News that investigators have another recording, taken at a location apart from the Saudi consulate or the Saudi consular residence where Turkey previously claimed Khashoggi's body had been taken.\n\nThe official claimed the other recording contains conversations which shed additional light on the nature of the killing and those who carried it out.\n\nThe existence of another recording was first reported by the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet. On Friday, the newspaper reported the details of a conversation among the Saudi team in the minutes before Khashoggi\u2019s killing. That report also said Turkey has recordings of international phone calls made by the Saudi team after Khashoggi was killed.\n\nA second Turkish official familiar with the investigation told ABC News the Hurriyet report was accurate.\n\nThe recordings have led Turkish investigators to determine that the plot was hatched in Saudi Arabia, the high-level Turkish official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe the investigation and the recordings which have not been publicly released.\n\nPetros Giannakouris/AP\n\nEarlier this month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Khashoggi\u2019s killing had been ordered at the \u201chighest levels\u201d in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn a move that has increased pressure on the international community to respond to Khashoggi's killing, Turkey said it has shared audio related to Khashoggi's killing with several other countries, including the United States and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"We gave them the tapes,\u201d Erdogan said on Saturday in the first public acknowledgment of the recordings. \u201cWe gave them to Saudi Arabia, to America, to the Germans, the French, to the British, to all of them.\u201d\n\nA French counterterror official who has read a transcript of the purported recording told ABC News that the alleged hit squad threatened to bring Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe recording also purports to capture the gory moment of Khashoggi's death inside the Saudi consulate. On it, a struggle can be heard followed by what is claimed to be Khashoggi's killing, according to a Western intelligence source who listened to part of the audio.\n\nCanada and Germany have both acknowledged receiving intelligence from Turkey about recordings of the murder.\n\n\"We are in discussions with our like-minded allies as to the next steps with regard to Saudi Arabia,\" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday. The account based on the recordings is among the latest in evolving -- often contradictory and competing -- narratives put forth by Turkey and Saudi Arabia as to what actually happened to Khashoggi, often through anonymously-sourced news reports.\n\nLeah Millis/Pool via AP\n\nFor several weeks after Khashoggi was last seen entering the Saudi consulate on October 2, Saudi officials insisted he had walked out of the building after applying for a certificate allowing him to marry his Turkish fianc\u00e9e.\n\nThe kingdom then changed its story to say the writer had died in a brawl with consulate officials. Eventually, Saudi Arabia admitted the killing was premeditated, saying Khashoggi was set upon as soon as he entered the building.\n\nShortly after Khashoggi went missing, Turkey alleged that the writer, who was critical of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was strangled and dismembered at the Saudi consulate by a 15-member assassination squad.\n\nNo trace of Khashoggi's body has been found and Turkish officials have since suggested the remains could have been chemically dissolved.\n\nSaudi officials characterized the killing as a rogue operation carried out by Saudi agents who exceeded their authority. Yet some of those implicated in the killing are close to the crown prince, including a member of the prince's entourage on foreign trips, who was seen at the consulate before Khashoggi's slaying.\n\nTurkey is seeking the extradition of 18 suspects who have been detained in Saudi Arabia, so they can be put on trial in Turkey. They include the 15 members of the alleged assassination team.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's national security adviser said that people who have listened to an audio recording of the killing of a Saudi journalist do not think it implicates Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in his death.\n\n\"That is not the conclusion that the people who have heard it have come to,\" John Bolton told reporters at a summit in Singapore.\n\nBolton said Trump wants to learn the truth about what happened at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul where Khashoggi was killed.\n\n\"I have not listened to the tape myself, but in the assessment of those who have listened to it, it does not, in any way, link the crown prince to the killing,\" Bolton said.\n\nErdogan described the content of the recording as a \"calamity\" and insisted that Riyadh take decisive action against Khashoggi's alleged killers.\n\nOn Thursday, Saudi Arabia said five of the individuals detained could face the death penalty if found guilty. Later on Thursday, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions on 17 individuals for their roles in Khashoggi\u2019s killing."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "2 paintings belonging to LOVE artist sold at auction", "description": "The estate of artist Robert Indiana, creator of the iconic LOVE series, has raised $5 million by auctioning two paintings that belonged to him", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/paintings-belonging-love-artist-auctioned-59240853", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/WireAP_f231630d0e33477f9aef3baed6c97a05_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T01:45:12Z", "content": "The estate of artist Robert Indiana, creator of the iconic LOVE series, auctioned off two paintings that belonged to him to raise money to defend against a lawsuit and to stabilize his deteriorating island home off the Maine coast.

The two forged a relationship in New York, and critics believe the painting should be shown in Indiana's Maine home once it's transformed into a museum . The other painting was Ruscha's \"Ruby.\"\n\nThe cash is needed because of mounting legal bills from a New York lawsuit claiming Indiana breached an agreement with the Morgan Art Foundation by entering into a side agreement with an art publisher, said estate attorney James Brannan.\n\nSome of the money also will be used to shore Indiana's home, the Star of Hope, which suffers from a leaky roof and other problems.\n\n\"It seems hasty and inappropriate,\" Princeton University art professor emeritus John Wilmerding said of the auction. \"The danger is that once they start selling stuff, it will just accelerate with each new crisis.\"\n\nThe reclusive artist died at age 89 on May 19 at his home on Vinalhaven Island, 15 miles (24 kilometers) off the coast of Rockland, Maine.

That's why the decision was made to sell a few pieces to raise some money.\n\nBrannan said he consulted with an art curator and decided that he had another 13 other works by Kelly, including a dozen sketches of Indiana that would serve to tell the story of the relationship. He also said he's reached out to the new owner of \"Orange Bluel\" to see about having it loaned and exhibited at Indiana's museum.\n\nWilmerding, a friend of Indiana's who paid summer visits to the Star of Hope, said he hopes someone can step in to ensure that Indiana's artwork isn't sold willy-nilly.\n\n\"Is this the first of what now will be an 'open sesame?'

She had been set up.\"\n\nAn attorney for D'Amico and Bobbitt was not immediately available to respond to Gerrow's claims on Friday night.\n\nABC News\n\nOn Thursday, Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina said at a news conference that the entire story of Bobbitt using his last $20 after McClure ran out of gas was \"predicated on a lie\" designed to dupe thousands of people into contributing to the campaign.\n\n\"Less than an hour after the GoFundMe campaign went live, McClure, in a text exchange with a friend, stated that the story about Bobbitt assisting her was fake.\"\n\n\u201c \u201d The story about the gas was what I refer to \u2014 and this is where the prosecutors and I have a disagreement \u2014 on Kate\u2019s part. It was puffing, it was exaggeration trying to help this veteran.\n\nIn one of the texts read by Coffina, McClure allegedly wrote to a friend, \"OK, so wait, the gas part is completely made up but the guy isn't. I had to make something up to make people feel bad. So, shush about the made up stuff.\"\n\nMcClure, 28, D'Amico, 39, and Bobbitt, 34, were all charged with second-degree theft by deception and conspiracy to commit theft by deception. McClure and D'Amico voluntarily surrendered to authorities on Wednesday, and have since been released, Coffina said.\n\nIf convicted, each of them faces five to 10 years in prison, prosecutors said.\n\nGerrow said that despite her deception, McClure\u2019s initial instinct was to help Bobbitt and that once the campaign reached a fever pitch in the media, she tried without success to end the ruse.\n\n\u201cAt $10,000, Kate tried to cut it off with GoFundMe, [but] they told her that couldn\u2019t be done,\" Gerrow said. \"She also tried to cut it off again at $100,000 because she was very concerned about the amount of money that was coming into the fund.\u201d\n\nABC News\n\nA spokesperson for GoFundMe, which has cooperated in the investigation and has agreed to refund money to the 14,000 people who donated to Bobbitt, countered Gerrow\u2019s claims.\n\n\"Campaign organizers are in full control of their campaigns, including their ability to turn off donations,\" spokesman Bobby Whithorne told ABC News late on Friday.\n\nIn fact, on the couple's GoFundMe page, McClure notes to supporters that \"Johnny asked me to please stop accepting donations today. ... He asked, instead of donating to his campaign, to maybe take a second to search for another worthy cause that, for whatever reason, hasn't gotten the attention his has.\"\n\nYet, in a subsequent post, McClure acknowledged closing out the campaign, only to reopen it shortly afterward.\n\n\"For the short time that we took it down, though, it is obvious that people still want to donate to his cause... You guys continue to amaze us.\"\n\nEarlier this week, GoFundMe released a statement about the case.\n\n\"While this type of behavior by an individual is extremely rare, it's unacceptable and clearly it has consequences. Committing fraud, whether it takes place on or offline is against the law. We are fully cooperating and assisting law enforcement officials to recover every dollar withdrawn by Ms. McClure and Mr. D'Amico,\" company officials said in a statement.\n\n'They hit the casinos hard'\n\nCoffina said the suspected fraudsters might have gotten away with the scam had Bobbitt not filed a lawsuit against McClure and D'Amico in August, accusing them of withholding the funds from him.\n\nThe money is all gone, most of it allegedly squandered by McClure and D'Amico on luxury handbags, a New Year's trip to Las Vegas and a BMW; the couple also used the donated funds to pay back $9,000 they owed to relatives and \"hit the casinos hard,\" Coffina said. Bank records showed they withdrew more than $85,000 at or near casinos in Atlantic City, Philadelphia and Las Vegas, he said.\n\nThey were ordered to appear in court on Christmas Eve.\n\nBurlington County Prosecutors office/AP\n\nBobbitt was arrested Wednesday night by the Philadelphia Police Department on charges of being a fugitive from justice, according to Philadelphia police. He is expected to be extradited to Burlington County to face charges related to the GoFundMe case.\n\nReached Thursday, an attorney for McClure and D'Amico told ABC News, \"We have no comment. Have a nice day.\"\n\nMedia blitz\n\nIn numerous media appearances, McClure claimed she was driving to meet a friend in September 2017 when she ran out of gas around midnight on the I-95 exit ramp near Philadelphia. Bobbitt, who was sleeping under a nearby overpass, came to her rescue, she would say. She claimed Bobbitt spent his last $20 to buy her gas.\n\n\"I pulled over to the side of the road as far as I could and I was going to get out and walk to the nearest gas station because it was not that far away, and that's when I met Johnny,\" McClure said last November in a \"Good Morning America\" interview. \"He walked up and he said, 'Get back in the car. Lock the doors. I'll be back.' I was just like, 'OK.'\"\n\n\u201c \u201d Campaign organizers are in full control of their campaigns, including their ability to turn off donations.\n\nShe said Bobbitt used his panhandling money to get her out of the jam.\n\n\"I almost couldn't believe it,\" McClure added. \"I said, 'Thank you... I swear, I'll be back. I promise I'll be back to give you [the] money back.'\"\n\nHoping to repay Bobbitt for the apparent generous act, McClure said she and D'Amico set up a GoFundMe online. The fund was launched on Nov. 10, 2017, just hours after D'Amico took a photo of McClure posing with Bobbitt near the I-95 exit ramp, Coffina said.\n\nABC News\n\n\"I just got her gas to help her get back on her way. I didn't think anything about it. I wasn't expecting anything in return,\" Bobbitt told \"Good Morning America.\" \"That's how I got the money to start with \u2014 from other people. [I had to] return the favor. I can't constantly take and not give back.\"\n\n'No Good Deed'\n\nCoffina said investigators believe McClure and D'Amico first met Bobbitt about a month before they launched the GoFundMe campaign near the Sugarhouse Casino in Philadelphia, close to the I-95 off-ramp where Bobbitt was living on the streets at the time.\n\nAsked who came up with the idea of the scam, Coffina noted a 2012 Facebook post written by Bobbitt that was \"remarkably similar\" to the narrative on the GoFundMe page.\n\n\"He reported that he helped a woman who had both run out of gas and had a flat tire at a Walmart, spent his last supper money to get her on her way and fix her flat tire,\" Coffina said. \"I don't think that's a coincidence.\"\n\nAmong the few things about the story that's true is that Bobbitt served in the Marine Corps and was homeless, Coffina said.\n\nMilitary records obtained by ABC News show that Bobbit served in the Marines as an ammunition technician from December 2002 to February 2004, and was awarded a National Defense Service Medal.\n\n\u201c \u201d I pulled over to the side of the road as far as I could and I was going to get out and walk to the nearest gas station because it was not that far away, and that's when I met Johnny. He walked up and he said, 'Get back in the car. Lock the doors. I'll be back.' I was just like, 'OK.'\n\n\"He deserves our appreciation for his willingness to serve our country as a United States Marine and he has our sympathy and concern for the homelessness that he's experienced, as well as his publicized struggle with addiction,\" Coffina said.\n\n\"But it is imperative to keep in mind that he was fully complicit in the scheme to defraud contributors, promoting the campaign in multiple media appearances and posing with D'Amico and McClure for a Philadelphia Inquirer story in front of a gas station that he did not buy gas from.\"\n\nIn August, Bobbitt filed a lawsuit accusing McClure and D'Amico of committing fraud by taking more than half of the money they raised for themselves. His pro bono attorney alleged in court papers that the couple treated the donations like their \"personal piggy bank to fund a lifestyle that they could not otherwise afford.\"\n\nD'Amico and McClure denied the allegations.\n\nIn September, the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office launched a criminal investigation into the missing GoFundMe donations and raided the couple's home, seizing a BMW and other belongings.\n\nCoffina said that even after burning through most of the money and getting sued by Bobbitt, D'Amico was allegedly thinking of ways to keep the scam going, including landing a book deal.\n\n\"He was certain the payday from the book deal they were pursuing would dwarf the money from the GoFundMe campaign,\" Coffina said. \"A few months later, when the dispute with Bobbitt became public, D'Amico was not dissuaded. Instead, he pitched a title for the book that would encompass the controversy, 'No Good Deed.'\"\n\nABC News' Aaron Katersky and Bill Hutchinson contributed to this report."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "ABC News", "title": "WATCH: Trump says he has written answers to questions from special counsel", "description": "ABC News has learned the president objected to some of the questions from Robert Mueller; Trump said he hadn't submitted the answers yet.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/trump-written-answers-questions-special-counsel-59256715", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/181116_wn_karl_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T00:58:03Z", "content": "Now Playing: President Trump again calls Mueller probe a 'witch hunt' in tweet Now Playing: Alleged plot against Robert Mueller referred to FBI Now Playing: Trump says he has written answers to questions from special counsel Now Playing: Retired Justice Alan \u2026 [+1151 chars]", "fulltext": "Transcript for Trump says he has written answers to questions from special counsel\n\nTonight, president trump says he has written answers to Robert Mueller and he has written the answers on his own.

Since no one in their right mind would accept the internationally worthless North Korean currency for any significant trade deal, North Korea must be burning up its foreign reserves. And when a country does that, prices generally start to rise \u2014 often dangerously so. All of which should be reflected in its exchange rates.\n\nSo what gives?\n\nUnderstanding what's going on with the North Korean economy is essential for negotiators trying to gauge how seriously leader Kim Jong Un is about giving up his nuclear weapons and whether sanctions are actually what got him to the negotiation table, as many in the U.S. government have suggested. Exchange rate stability would normally suggest otherwise. But does it?\n\n\"The fact that the rate is stable means that the overall economy of the country is stable and it is growing,\" Ri Ki Song, an economist with the Economic Institute of the North's Academy of Social Sciences, said in a recent interview in Pyongyang with The Associated Press. \"Our economy is not an economy that relies on exports. ... Due to the sanctions, we are not making a lot of trade or financial dealings with other countries, so there will be not so many changes in the exchange rates.\"\n\nThe North Korean currency, called the won, has two exchange rates. One is set by the government at an artificially high level and is used mainly in shops or hotels that deal only in foreign currency. The other, more closely watched, is tied to market forces and is a better reflection of actual economic conditions. It has stayed mostly within a narrow band of around 8,000 to the U.S. dollar since about 2012-2013.\n\nAs Ri suggested, there are signs the North Korean economy has been doing well under Kim. But there is clearly a lot more going on.\n\nFirst off, North Korea's economy has never been self-reliant. It has depended heavily on exporting goods such as coal, textiles and seafood.\n\n\"There's a reason these goods are sanctioned,\" said Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein, co-editor of North Korean Economy Watch. He added that Kim has been trying to boost domestic production to reduce the country's reliance on imports and lift consumption of domestically made goods, which wouldn't be necessary if North Korea was economically self-reliant.\n\nSilberstein and fellow economy watcher Peter Ward, in a paper published Thursday by the respected 38 North website, argued the North has several tools to promote stability, such as limiting traders to a specific exchange rate bandwidth or reducing loans in the local currency to keep its circulation low. They also suggested there simply might not be enough dollars in circulation for the market price to be impacted by the sentiments of ordinary people. Or, perhaps, the government is keeping it artificially stable \"by sheer force \u2014 for political reasons \u2014 to present an image of resilience through sanctions.\"\n\nBill Brown, a former CIA officer and adjunct professor at Georgetown School of Foreign Service, said Ri's claims about overall economic stability aren't without merit.\n\n\"But the right question, then, is at what cost,\" he said in an email to the AP.\n\nBrown, now an independent consultant, believes the North is doing what China has been doing for the past 40 years \u2014 selling off its assets. Because the state owns all capital, he said, in the short term it can fund itself and protect the exchange rate by selling or privatizing a good part of its property. It could also be raising money by allowing officials to charge for ordinary activities or skimping on salaries while looking the other way as they accept bribes to make up the difference. The problem, of course, is none of that is sustainable.\n\n\"Stable money is essential to building a new market economy, enhancing private sector-led productivity and growth and allowing citizens to save and invest their own money,\" Brown said. \"I suspect Kim knows good, or at least not bad, relations with (President Donald) Trump and America are essential for confidence in the won and is behaving accordingly. So, for now, no ICBM or nuclear weapon tests, and lots of happy talk.\"\n\nNorth Korean leaders are well aware of the dangers of a volatile currency.\n\nWidespread panic ensued in 2009 when the government decided to exchange the old currency for a new one \u2014 at a rate of 100 to 1, erasing personal savings in one fell swoop. Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il, reportedly had the finance minister executed for the fiasco.\n\nBecause of such concerns, even ordinary people have good reason to want to keep their savings in dollars or Chinese yuan. And while confidence in the local currency has recovered in recent years, it still can't be converted into other currencies outside of North Korea and remains ill-suited for big transactions.\n\nAs Silberstein and Ward point out, its biggest denomination is the 5,000 bill \u2014 worth about 60 cents.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTalmadge is the AP's Pyongyang bureau chief.

Meteorologist rob Marciano leading it off. Reporter: Tonight, with snow still falling in parts of the northeast, the nightmare is not over. A historic November nor'easter. Stranding passengers and cars, passengersing at airports and students stranded at school into the night. This storm hit right in the perfect hour. Right as rush hour was starting. Reporter: In Manhattan, six inches of snow and ice. Hundreds of trees crashing down and the weight of the snow gathering on the trees. Watch out, watch out! Reporter: Blocking roads, crushing cars. I just heard a crack. The whole limb, the whole branch just fell down. Reporter: The stunning scene on New York's George Washington bridge, a 20-car pileup. Some were forced to get out of the car and walk across the bridge. Nearly 2,000 crashes in 12 hours. Even if you say it's an exceedingly unusual set of events that come together, we still can't let it happen again. Reporter: Meanwhile, a sea of frustrated commuters in New York City's bus termal. The crowd held back by armed guard. Some commuters get out and push. Many abandoning their cars. These students forced to spend the night. The parents could not pick them up from school. They watched the movie \"Frozen\". Yeah, I want fod go home. Reporter: On interstate 78 in Pennsylvania, police using sirening, banging on doors to wake truckers and drivers to wake drivers who had fallen asleep. One driver traveling north from Florida on interstate 95 in Connecticut was killed after getting out of the car to clear snow. Air travel grinding to a halt. Passengers stuck there too. We were stuck on the plane for two hours. Travelers krark on cots from Boston's Logan airport to Newark. What a chaotic scene there. You are tracking another system? Reporter: Yes, we are, David. We are not quite done with this one which outperformed our forecast. Off the coast of Maine, and other storm you talked about, a winter storm warning for Wyoming and North Dakota, a two-pronged system that will bring snow and through Minneapolis, Chicago, and the areas that got ice earlier this week. Behind that, windchills will be below zero. David? Rob, thanks as always.

But its deeply entrenched troubles, including widespread poverty, corruption and lawlessness, also stand to be scrutinized.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTONGUE TWISTER\n\nMore than 1,000 tribes with over 800 different languages are scattered across 22 provinces, including in its capital Port Moresby and faraway mountain hinterlands and islands. Inadequate infrastructure and potholed roads, however, have kept apart diverse tribal groups more than the language barrier. English, which is widely spoken, and a creole English called Tok Pisin, have helped bridge the divide. The isolation has helped preserve ancient traditions in the most remote villages, where belief in black magic and sorcery has persisted in an era of great technological advances.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAPEC-CHALLENGED\n\nThe APEC host is the most challenged on many counts in the free-trade club, which includes the world's leading economic heavyweights \u2014 the United States, China and Japan \u2014 and accounts for 60 percent of global gross domestic product and nearly half of world trade. Although it's resource rich, Papua New Guinea is the 21-member bloc's most impoverished and youngest member. It declared independence from its Australian colonizer only in 1975. It was helped by Australia, which remains its biggest aid provider, along with China, the United States and New Zealand to deal with the logistical challenges of hosting a year of APEC meetings, including construction of the main venue.\n\nWhen it joined APEC in 1993, Papua New Guinea had to court the backing of Asian neighbors to gain entry into the prestigious bloc of Pacific Rim nations and explain that it's located in the region, its former prime minister, Julius Chan, said. \"First they don't think that PNG was an Asian country,\" Chan told the Nation newspaper. \"I insisted that we are right in the center of the Asia and the Pacific.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nLAW AND ORDER\n\nCrime and violence in Papua New Guinea are notoriously prevalent based on anecdotal accounts and media reports, and are a national concern. Statistics are at best spotty but a World Bank study several years ago reported that crime levels have stayed consistently high for more than a decade, with robbery and assault the most common. Family and sexual violence were highly prevalent too and homicide rate in at least two areas, including the capital, is among the highest in the world.\n\nConcern over lawlessness has made hosting 20 world leaders and more than 12,000 APEC delegates Papua New Guinea's biggest security worry. \"It is risky for expatriates to travel alone at any time of the day or night,\" a government do's and don'ts primer warned foreign delegates, some of whom were billeted in luxury cruise ships along with visiting journalists because there weren't enough hotels in Port Moresby.\n\nAustralia, the U.S. and New Zealand provided armed personnel, navy ships, jets and surveillance helicopters to help augment security. Still, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence decided to spend nights in Cairns city in neighboring Australia while attending the meetings on behalf of President Donald Trump, who decided not to go."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "GOP prepares to subpoena Comey, Lynch before losing power", "description": "Republicans arguing that there was bias in President Barack Obama's Justice Department are preparing to subpoena two key witnesses in the final weeks of their majority", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/gop-prepares-subpoena-comey-lynch-losing-power-59250509", "urlToImage": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/WireAP_4160faff4702454f9c8e32d2258c26cf_16x9_992.jpg", "publishedAt": "2018-11-17T00:14:06Z", "content": "House Republicans who have spent the last two years arguing that there was bias in President Barack Obama 's Justice Department are preparing to subpoena two key witnesses in the final weeks of their majority former FBI Director James Comey and former Attorne\u2026 [+2394 chars]", "fulltext": "House Republicans who have spent the last two years arguing that there was bias in President Barack Obama's Justice Department are preparing to subpoena two key witnesses in the final weeks of their majority \u2014 former FBI Director James Comey and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Robert Goodlatte, R-Va., has notified colleagues that he will subpoena Comey for a closed-door deposition Nov. 29 and Lynch for Dec. 5, according to a person familiar with the subpoenas. The person declined to be identified because the person was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nThe subpoenas are part of an investigation by two GOP-led committees into decisions made by the department during the 2016 election, when Democrat Hillary Clinton was cleared in a probe into her email use and Justice officials launched an investigation into Trump's campaign and Russia. Both Comey and Lynch were in power during that time.\n\nRepublicans on the House Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform panels have argued that Justice officials were conspiring against Trump's election, and they have interviewed multiple current and former Justice officials behind closed doors in an effort to prove their case.\n\nIt's unclear if Comey and Lynch will appear, or if Republicans would be able to enforce the subpoenas, since they lose the House majority in January. Goodlatte and the chairman of the Oversight panel, Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, are both retiring.\n\nComey's lawyer, David Kelley, said Friday that Comey hasn't heard from the Judiciary panel since the committee requested an interview earlier this year and Comey told them he would testify in public.\n\nComey offered his views on Twitter:\n\n\"House Republicans can ask me anything they want but I want the American people to watch, so let's have a public hearing,\" he said. \"Truth is best served by transparency. Let me know when is convenient.\"\n\nA lawyer for Lynch did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDemocrats have strongly objected to the GOP probe, saying it is an effort to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.\n\nNew York Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the top Democrat on the committee and its likely incoming chairman, said in a statement that Comey and Lynch had both indicated a willingness to answer the Republicans' questions voluntarily.\n\n\"These subpoenas are coming out of the blue, with very little time left on the calendar, and after the American people have resoundingly rejected the GOP's approach to oversight \u2014 if, indeed, 'oversight' is the word we should use for running interference for President Trump,\" Nadler said."}, {"source": {"id": "abc-news", "name": "ABC News"}, "author": "The Associated Press", "title": "Groups protest plans for possible lease sale in Beaufort", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.

Environmental groups say it's irresponsible to plan lease sales ahead of a ruling.\n\n\"Rather than moving ahead with expending large amounts of governmental resources for analyses and holding public hearings for a lease sale the court may decide is illegal, the Trump Administration should wait for the court's decision,\" said Lois Epstein, Arctic program director for The Wilderness Society, in a prepared statement.\n\nThe Bureau of Ocean Energy Management announced Thursday it would prepare the environmental review in support of a potential oil and gas lease sale in the Beaufort Sea next year. The review would analyze potential effects of leasing, exploration, development and production. A 30-day public comment period runs through Dec. 17.\n\nThe agency scheduled public hearings in three Arctic coast communities followed by a hearing Dec.6 in Anchorage.\n\n\"We especially need to hear from residents of the Beaufort Sea communities, letting us know how the proposed leasing area is currently being used and what specific areas need extra attention,\" said James Kendall, BOEM's Alaska region director.\n\nThe agency said the proceedings do not mean a final decision to hold a lease sale has been made.\n\nThe environmental review process is kicking in before the administration has completed a new national five-year leasing program, circumventing an established public process for offshore development, Oceana officials said Friday.\n\n\"Despite the risks of offshore drilling, it appears as though President Trump is charging ahead and that the decision to offer leases for 65 million acres of the Beaufort Sea has already been made, with no regard for the dangers or the established public process,\" said Diane Hoskins, Oceana's campaign director.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama used executive orders to ban drilling in most U.S. Arctic waters. President Donald Trump in April 2017 signed his own executive order reversing the bans.\n\nEnvironmental groups sued, claiming Trump exceeded his power by reversing the ban on offshore drilling in the Arctic as well as dozens of underwater canyons in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe case was argued Nov. 9 in Anchorage. The lawsuit contends Congress has authorized presidents to halt drilling in unleased lands of the outer continental shelf but does not allow them to reopen areas.\n\nActing Assistant U.S. Attorney General Jeffrey Wood said the law was meant to be flexible. He said it was not intended to bind one president with decisions made by the previous one when determining offshore stewardship.\n\nU.S. District Judge Sharon Gleason took the case under advisement."}]
